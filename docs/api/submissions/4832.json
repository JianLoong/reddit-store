I shared this with my husband and while he doesn\u2019t have to eat every dish (which is part of the tradition) im not making him anything special, as I need my kitchen.  He doesn\u2019t mind this tradition.  My aunt married a man who also picks and chooses the dishes he will eat at dinner and then has a pizza delivered after dinner for himself lol.\n\nIn addition, on Christmas Day, I have embraced his family\u2019s traditional meal.

You're welcome to opt out of meat if you want, but it's not your place to tell other people what they can or can't eat.", "I really am trying to understand how him having meat *in addition* to your traditional meatless dishes is ruining the tradition. \n\nLike, I grew up catholic. During lent, we were not allowed to eat meat on fridays. On Black Friday, right before Easter, my family would traditionally make grilled cheese & tomato soup. \n\nNow, if my partner and I were to celebrate Black Friday & he wanted to have chicken wings as well as tomato soup and grilled cheese, that\u2019s not ruining the tradition to me. It\u2019s just adding to it. \n\nIdk I don\u2019t want to call you an asshole because this is obviously important to you, but I\u2019m confused about *what* exactly is important. Is having the turkey really ruining the tradition? Do you feel like your partner isn\u2019t respecting or fully taking part in the tradition? If he has his turkey, will he still be eating the other dishes? \n\nI feel like you\u2019re interpreting this tradition too rigidly and not trying to find a way to celebrate it that you and your partner will *both* enjoy.

This is such an easy thing in my mind. You're not monopolizing the whole holiday, just wanting an evening to feel like home l. Tradition is lovely, and people that care about you and what you love/hold dear/appreciate should be able to respect that, and you. One meal going meatless is perfectly reasonable. The compromise is that he can do whatever he wants for food the next day.

That meal is centered around *non-meat* traditional dishes. He's not willing to participate in a single meal to experience your traditions. Considering how tame they are, that's a red flag to me.

Luckily where I\u2019m from 80% of the population are meat lovers, the quickest way to have your food business fail is not giving your customers enough meat. The most successful businesses in my country are meat business and alcohol.", "Did you tell him that there wasn't going to be meat before he agreed?", "He can agree to your traditions and still do his own get out of here your obviously arguing with people.", "He\u2019s allowed to pick and choose which parts of your culture and tradition he\u2019ll participate in. He\u2019s also allowed to change his mind at any time. As long as he\u2019s not making you cook it, stop arguing and let him have his meat.", "Seems like he does actually care.", "She doesn't say there are more traditions, she only lists the meat.  It's her tradition, not us to question it.  Question is, why can't or why doesn't he agree?  It's just one meal, not that big of a deal to skip meat for one meal.  He can eat meat any other time during the day, she just asks for one dinner meal.  I think if you love someone and respect someone's traditions, I think you can skip meat for that one meal.  Maybe you don't.", "There are more traditions but it's small things like having extra plate, saying wishes before the meal and sharing with kind of bread thing, opening gifts after the dinner, etc so not really huge things but they make the Christmas eve more special and are traditions.", "You should still go to a doctor about the mood thing, that could be a serious issue. As an adult you should not have a complete personality change while hungry.\n\nAlso- have you never been to a meal where you just didn\u2019t like the food for whatever reason?", "He doesn't think meal is full without meat. I wouldn't ask him to skip it on random day, it's just one that is very important to me and I don't think it's such a horrible to ask for?", "I think people can skip meat I do it all the time. My question is why is OP so focused on what he's eating.  She did mention there are mot traditions after you commented. So if he does them all why argue over something so small. \n\nSeems more as a wanting to control someone instead of actually enjoying the holiday together. That's my thing. \n\nIf this was me I wouldn't care and say \"no it has to be exactly how my family does it or not at all\"", "Yea, so if he's willing to do every single thing, why can't you compromise and let him eat a piece of turkey"]}
