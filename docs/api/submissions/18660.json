It's a shame that the wife is no longer there at nap time because that would be a great venue for the music.\n\n If your property manager is unresponsive, I would call the local authorities to lodge sound complaints as well as the ASPCA or some other animal welfare agency. What they are doing is not right and hurts their puppy.\n\n They have been most unneighborly and blocked you, when you were very responsive to their needs. Anything you do now that messes with their lives is fair.  Personally, I would share with them the fact that you didn't treat them that way when they had requests.  Acknowledge that it's difficult to leave a puppy at home, but they either need to get a pet sitter or use doggy day care.
