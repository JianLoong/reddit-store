Crank it up and keep it up past bedtime. It's a shame that the wife is no longer there at nap time because that would be a great venue for the music.\n\n If your property manager is unresponsive, I would call the local authorities to lodge sound complaints as well as the ASPCA or some other animal welfare agency. What they are doing is not right and hurts their puppy.\n\n They have been most unneighborly and blocked you, when you were very responsive to their needs. Anything you do now that messes with their lives is fair.  Personally, I would share with them the fact that you didn't treat them that way when they had requests.  Acknowledge that it's difficult to leave a puppy at home, but they either need to get a pet sitter or use doggy day care. Knowingly inflicting suffering on you because they aren't there to hear it is wrong.", "I am totally high-fiving your pettiness.", "Please do, and post the update immediately!", "I mean yes, but that\u2019s awesome.\n\nSo my official verdict is NTA.", "NTA.

The crate training should have been completed when they first got the puppy, not only when the wife goes back to work 8+ hours a day when it doesn't get let out to use the bathroom, or go for a walk at all.
