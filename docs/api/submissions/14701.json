In that time I\u2019ve had one guy (my boyfriend) stay overnight a whopping total of 3 times. When I moved in, Jess said she didn't care about sleepovers (I guess that changed) so I always made sure to let her know when my bf was coming over and we were always respectful and tried to coordinate times when she wasn\u2019t going to be home. He also never mooched off us and we mostly hung at his place because Jess was so insufferable to be around when you had guests.\n\nJess and I recently got into a huge argument about it and she said it\u2019s disrespectful of me to have a guy overnight. We clearly both had our own opinions about it and couldn\u2019t persuade the other so I made arrangements to move in with my boyfriend and Jess was going to find a new flatmate.\n\nHer (Kate) and her boyfriend came over to check the place out. I could tell Jess was irritated by that since she was only sharing with the girl and not the pair. At one point, Kate made a comment about the size of the bed (king size) and some comment to her boyfriend about the romantic nights they\u2019d spend together.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole; I knew that if Kate moved in, there would be some huge argument about her boyfriend in the near future especially since she was making comments abut him hanging out there. So while we were waiting for Jess to get some things from another room, I mentioned that she doesn't like her roommates having guys over at all, especially over night. This seemed to concern the pair and they asked Jess about it when she came back over.\n\nShe looked really embarrassed and said \u2018I\u2019m not actually.\u2019  The pair tried to pry for answers but she said that if Kate moved in, her boyfriend couldn\u2019t stay for more than a few hours at a time, especially not overnight.\n\nThis caused Kate and her boyfriend to leave. After they left, Jess blew up at me and accused me of sabotaging the meeting. I said that she\u2019s being ridiculous because there is no way in hell she\u2019s going to be ok with Kate and her boyfriend if she wasn\u2019t ok with me and mine. She called me 'vindictive' and 'malicious' to bring up her no-boy rule. I said that I never technically broke her rules as we agreed on allowing sleepovers so long as we told the other person but her views have clearly changed but it's not my fault that she didn't tell me.\n\nNow she's infuriated with me.

A potential new roommate has the right to know the truth before moving in.", "NTA - Jess can have that rule but she needs to disclose it to any potential roommates. You were correct to let Kate know. Jess needs to live alone, find a roommate that agrees with this policy, or travel back in time to 1940 and live in a womens-only boarding house.", "Nta What right does she have to enforce this rule?", "NTA. She\u2019s essentially lying to them by pretending it would be fine until the girl already moved in and can\u2019t do anything about it. You did future roommate a favor.", "NTA. Let her be infuriated, and do it again if she lies again. Not telling potential room mates about this \"rule\", she's totally TA. Enjoy your space and time with your boyfriend!", "You let ppl know that she was lying by omission.... Sounds like a \"bro\" move. Sounds like Jess is either super conservative or is gay and has feelings.....", "NTA - That is information she should definitely have \\*\\*before\\*\\* moving in.  Jess is an AH for not being up-front about it.", "NTA you're potentially saving someone from being duped once they move in. They need to know the situation before they sign anything and move in.", "NTA. Sounds like Jess/Jane wants a roommate badly enough to lie to them about how she feels about sleepovers. Which is kind of stupid. I don't think it was an AH move to warn someone before they have to go through what you're going through because she's not willing to tell the truth at the outset.", "NTA. She\u2019s welcome to have that expectation of people, but she needs to tell them up front. You were right to bring it up. \n\nWhy would she want to have someone move in only to argue with them about who they choose to spend their time with in their room and have them move out again?\n\nShe needs to be honest about that stipulation if she wants to end up with someone who is also looking for a women-only living space (or is it a significant-other-free space??).", "NTA. Jess is insane. This is exactly the type of issue roommates need to hammer out BEFORE they move in together if there's a snowball's chance of the roommate-ship working. \n\nIn young adulthood, it's common to have intimate romantic relationships. If Jess can't handle that in her space ... fine! She just needs to room with others who feel the same way, or who, for whatever reason, agree to accept her \"no boy\" rule. Hiding this information beforehand, then no doubt springing it on the roommate the first time her partner comes over to spend the night, is utterly and completely unfair on her part. It can cause a lot of hassle, and potentially a lot of money if the new roommate moves in then feels she has to move out again because of Jess's feelings.", "NTA.  She needs to be upfront about this rule with potential roommates, not blindside them like she did you.   It's not fair to change the rules after moving in and having a committed roommate situation.  She'll have a hard time finding another roommate but there may be some out there.", "NTA, you saved everyone a ton of hassle.", "NTA  she should be telling them that herself", "NTA\n\nbut no boy rule works great for some people idk why your roommate is embarrassed by it.\n\nI know girls who would rather just not have a guy around", "NTA. You were good to warn the girl before she got caught up in Jess' bullshit. Let Jess stay mad. It's her own issue.", "NTA. Does she own the home and is there a guest clause in your rental agreement? If not, then she has no right to dictate this. It is courtesy not to have your bf over there so much that he feels like a third roommate and/or is using utilities too much. But one to three nights per week nonconsecutive, is pretty reasonable. And you could hang out together all day if you wanted to, again, as long as it's not most days. \n\nI'm glad you're getting out but I would encourage you not to comply with unreasonable requests like this in future and learn to advocate for yourself. I had to learn this at your age through my 20s, so I get the struggle.\n\nAlso, is it Jess or Jane? You use both names more than once.", "NTA for passing on the info, but a bit of a YTA for doing it when Jess was out of the room. Why not say it when she was there? Then it would be completely in the open.\n\nAnd why would Jess not want potential tenants to know about her rule? Is it that she takes delight in kicking them out later? That's sadistic. Otherwise, she's being illogical. Because then you're stuck finding another roommate.", "The real answer is \"who cares\". You're not gonna see her again, since you clearly don't like her.
