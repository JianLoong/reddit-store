In that time I\u2019ve had one guy (my boyfriend) stay overnight a whopping total of 3 times.

He also never mooched off us and we mostly hung at his place because Jess was so insufferable to be around when you had guests.\n\nJess and I recently got into a huge argument about it and she said it\u2019s disrespectful of me to have a guy overnight. We clearly both had our own opinions about it and couldn\u2019t persuade the other so I made arrangements to move in with my boyfriend and Jess was going to find a new flatmate.\n\nHer (Kate) and her boyfriend came over to check the place out. I could tell Jess was irritated by that since she was only sharing with the girl and not the pair. At one point, Kate made a comment about the size of the bed (king size) and some comment to her boyfriend about the romantic nights they\u2019d spend together.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole; I knew that if Kate moved in, there would be some huge argument about her boyfriend in the near future especially since she was making comments abut him hanging out there. So while we were waiting for Jess to get some things from another room, I mentioned that she doesn't like her roommates having guys over at all, especially over night. This seemed to concern the pair and they asked Jess about it when she came back over.\n\nShe looked really embarrassed and said \u2018I\u2019m not actually.\u2019  The pair tried to pry for answers but she said that if Kate moved in, her boyfriend couldn\u2019t stay for more than a few hours at a time, especially not overnight.\n\nThis caused Kate and her boyfriend to leave. After they left, Jess blew up at me and accused me of sabotaging the meeting. I said that she\u2019s being ridiculous because there is no way in hell she\u2019s going to be ok with Kate and her boyfriend if she wasn\u2019t ok with me and mine. She called me 'vindictive' and 'malicious' to bring up her no-boy rule. I said that I never technically broke her rules as we agreed on allowing sleepovers so long as we told the other person but her views have clearly changed but it's not my fault that she didn't tell me.\n\nNow she's infuriated with me.
