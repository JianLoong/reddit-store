In that time I\u2019ve had one guy (my boyfriend) stay overnight a whopping total of 3 times.

He also never mooched off us and we mostly hung at his place because Jess was so insufferable to be around when you had guests.\n\nJess and I recently got into a huge argument about it and she said it\u2019s disrespectful of me to have a guy overnight. We clearly both had our own opinions about it and couldn\u2019t persuade the other so I made arrangements to move in with my boyfriend and Jess was going to find a new flatmate.\n\nHer (Kate) and her boyfriend came over to check the place out. I could tell Jess was irritated by that since she was only sharing with the girl and not the pair. At one point, Kate made a comment about the size of the bed (king size) and some comment to her boyfriend about the romantic nights they\u2019d spend together.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole; I knew that if Kate moved in, there would be some huge argument about her boyfriend in the near future especially since she was making comments abut him hanging out there. So while we were waiting for Jess to get some things from another room, I mentioned that she doesn't like her roommates having guys over at all, especially over night. This seemed to concern the pair and they asked Jess about it when she came back over.\n\nShe looked really embarrassed and said \u2018I\u2019m not actually.\u2019  The pair tried to pry for answers but she said that if Kate moved in, her boyfriend couldn\u2019t stay for more than a few hours at a time, especially not overnight.\n\nThis caused Kate and her boyfriend to leave. After they left, Jess blew up at me and accused me of sabotaging the meeting. I said that she\u2019s being ridiculous because there is no way in hell she\u2019s going to be ok with Kate and her boyfriend if she wasn\u2019t ok with me and mine. She called me 'vindictive' and 'malicious' to bring up her no-boy rule. I said that I never technically broke her rules as we agreed on allowing sleepovers so long as we told the other person but her views have clearly changed but it's not my fault that she didn't tell me.\n\nNow she's infuriated with me.

This roommate should live alone and be a miserable controlling weirdo by herself", "NTA, she was totally willing to trap this girl Kate in whatever agreement she signed by lying to her and tricking her into a hostile environment.", "[removed]", "NTA.  Jess should have been up front and clear the moment the walked in the door together.  Moving is a pain in the ass and difficult roommates who pretend to be cool at first are doubly so.  You did the lords work.", "NTA, she\u2019s trying to trick people and that\u2019s not cool. She needs to be truthful.", "You did all parties a favor,even Jess.

Frankly, if Jess did that, Kate would be in the right to move in and then say \u201cthat was never in the rules I agreed to.  Go pound sand.\u201d", "NTA. OP has no obligation to Jess at all about anything. She is free to tell people Jess snores (if she does) or anything else that was an issue for her.

If you're feeling particularly petty, go make some posts on local pages on social media about her hidden rule.

All OP has done is tell the truth.  NTA", "She's being dishonest because the vast majority of adult renters will want to bring guests over. And she knows it.

Obviously I can\u2019t ban you from having guests etc, but I did make clear  in the interview that communication and a notificAtion would be appreciated.  I mean if you wanna have friends over and they\u2019re not destroying stuff and your paying rent I have no leg to stand on beyond my own comfort.  \nBut I was 100% up front about it", "Not without something concrete in the lease agreement, she's not. OP and potential new roommate could have people over with impunity if it's not against the actual rules laid out. She just hasn't met anyone as audacious as her who would be willing to butt heads over it.", "She\u2019s doing that so she can land a roommate\u2026 why would she be upfront about something as ridiculous as \u201cyour boyfriend is only allowed over for like two hours max before I demand he leave, don\u2019t even dare think about him spending the night\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019ll be much harder for them to leave, once they\u2019re already established in the apartment too. She just wants someone to pay her rent.

Promise one thing then after commitment, it changes to something else with no explanation.", "NTA.\n\nKate is clearly a control freak and horrible room mate.

You would have let this new girl move in and torture Jess by having her boyfriend over *constantly*.\n\nYou actually did Jess a favor. She should just be upfront.
