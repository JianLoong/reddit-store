Turns out while I was sleeping my husband had come home, and then needed to go back out again but his car was running low on fuel. He took my car, and ended up having an allergy reaction. My husband rarely ever takes my car, and he always asks me before he does which is why I felt safe eating in there. I was planning on cleaning it when I woke up but he took it. He went to hospital and he was treated and quickly recovered, but he's now claiming that I carelessly put his life in danger and that I should've had the decency to text him and let him know that my car was contaminated. It didn't even cross my mind because he *never uses my car*. \n\nHe's demanding an apology, and I refused so he's been staying at his brother's house since Sunday night saying that he doesn't 'feel safe' around me because I 'don't regret putting his life in danger'.

NTA - not sure what his problem is, but he needs to get a grip or he will be only seeing his child on alternate weekends because his behavior is unacceptable and childish, IMHO.", "NTA\n\nYes you could have share with him that you had seafood inside your car. But was it necessary? He has his own car and could have driven it to a nearby petrol station to pump before heading out rather than taking yours, unless you\u2019re saying the fuel is so low and the nearest station is far away. Even then, he should have asked you first before taking your car. So essentially he f himself up and tries to blame you to hide his embarrassment. For someone who\u2019s so deathly allergic to something, shouldn\u2019t he have an epipen on standby in case of emergency? Good luck for raising 2 child instead of 1\n\nEdit to add: instead of eating at home due to the rain OP actually ate them in her own car, compromising for the husband who sounded like a 3 yo, anyone still thinking OP should have done more is ridiculous when husband didn\u2019t do anything much to protect himself like by asking", "NTA the whole thing sounds like a giant accident/miscommunication. No one really to blame your husband is being a bit unreasonable here. If he commonly used your car then I would think you should have told him but he doesn't so this was just an one off incident.", "YTA, I can\u2019t imagine my spouse nearly dying because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to say \u2018I\u2019ve eaten seafood in the car don\u2019t go in\u2019 and not feel bad about it. Surely these events show it\u2019s necessary?? Sure you didn\u2019t have any reason to think he\u2019d use it, it was an accident\u2026 but how can you nearly lose the father of your child and choose this hill to die on? \n\nIt\u2019s an apology, to someone who is shook up because you nearly caused him to die. I know you\u2019re pregnant, and things are rough rn with your eating - but doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t apologise for not giving him a heads up. Just a text saying \u2018I know you don\u2019t use the car but I ate seafood in it, so don\u2019t use it until I clean it\u201d. My dad never drives my mums car, does he clean it? Refuel it? Check the tires etc? Forget his sunglasses in there? All yes to these things. \n\nImagine, for a moment that he had died. Your partner, your best friend, the dad of your child. All because you didn\u2019t send a text? If this doesn\u2019t play on your conscience, you\u2019re ice cold", "I was thinking N-A-H, since I think it was reasonable that this risk was unforeseen on your part and clearly he would react strongly to a life-threatening allergic reaction.\n\nSo we've got a tense situation, maybe some words get said, but his actions after the fact lead me to NTA. Instead of talking about it with you and working out how similar events can be avoided in the future, he decided he's going to leave his pregnant wife alone while he camps out at his brothers.", "NAH (kinda) - Idk dude just apologize. It wasn't intentional and you didn't really do anything wrong, but saying \"I'm sorry you had an allergic reaction (because of an honest mistake), next time I'll make sure I'm more clear about where I've eaten seafood\" isn't really a big deal. Although I do think refusing to come home is super petty on the part of your husband, as we all know you didn't do it on purpose", "I can't imagine having my spouse come that close to dying because of something I did - no matter how innocent a thing it was - and not feeling bad enough about it to do a small thing like apologizing. YTA. Hopefully it's just the stress of the pregnancy.", "Considering the seriousness of the allergy I'd say YTA for holding out on the specific apology. \n\nEven though he rarely uses your car, it was still a risky situation you put him in. \n\nPersonally, I am the partner in my relationship with a serious allergy. My partner doesn't consume my allergen as a way to protect me. If he was to consume it even not around me, he decontaminates any relevant areas immediately when he's done that I could potentially be exposed to.\n\nIf he had died, how would you feel? I'm sure you'd issue that apology in a second to bring him back.", "This is clearly a minority vote, but I'm going with NAH - but only because you're both suffering stress, otherwise it would be E S H.\n\nYou're pregnant, you've got hyperemesis, that is a crappy situation. You didn't have any reason to believe your husband would take your car before you could have it cleaned, so you're not the AH for not texting him.\n\nHe has a severe seafood allergy and nearly died because he didn't know you'd been eating shrimp in your car, so he's not the AH for being angry and frightened and reacting.\n\nMutual apology sounds like a plan.  You should be sorry you accidentally put his life at risk when you know he has a severe seafood allergy. He should be sorry he blew up at you like that when he knows you're pregnant with hyperemesis.", "YTA\n \nYou\u2019re aware that his allergy is sensitive and severe enough that you consume seafood outside, and \u201cwipe down\u201d everything when done. If this level of precaution is taken, he should definitely be given a forewarning of possible seafood contaminated areas. Yes, even your car, because it\u2019s a shared space he may actually enter, like he did.", "ESH - you should apologise,  he got sick enough to go to hospital that's understandably stressful.   However the apology isn't so much that what you did was super obvious to cause this to happen but it still did result in the outcome... why make it into a fight where he feels like he can't come home?  Albeit he is acting childish about it.", "YTA. I have an anaphylactic seafood allergy (always carry two epi pens) and there\u2019s no way my husband would consider eating seafood anywhere, let alone eat it and then go into our house.  Every possession we both own is a seafood free zone because you can never completely decontaminate an inside area. Having an allergy like this is terrifying at times, as never know when you\u2019re going to react, or how severe your next reaction is going to be. It\u2019s like living with the sword of Damocles hanging over your head. \nI get it. You\u2019re pregnant and need to gain weight, but come on. You could kill your future child\u2019s father if you keep up this bullshit. Being pregnant isn\u2019t an excuse, no matter how much you may want to make it one.", "NTA. It's simply bad luck that he used your car during the small window you were napping, especially since he rarely ever uses your car. It's not unreasonable or reckless for you to not have thought it would be an issue. He's an AH for his reaction and claiming you put his life in danger when it's clearly just a case of bad luck.", "YTA\n\nYou *did* put his life in danger. You *should* apologise.", "YTA.  You know how bad his allergy is, so you know you should have told him that you had seafood in your car and had not cleaned it. A text takes less than a minute, dying from anaphylactic shock however is permanent.", "YTA for sure. This is how accidents happen and you should let him know always where you ate seafood even if it is ridiculous.", "YTA. hello. You could've killed your own husband.  You don't even feel a bit guilty for that?  \n\nBecause I've been married for 20 + years. I'd feel horrible if I did that. So careless of you and you know about his allergies too. \n\nDo better. Soon the baby will be born.\n\nHe wants an apology. Give it to him jeez. The poor guy doesn't even feel safe with you.  Sad.", "NTA: your husband has an entitlement issue. If he is not willing to swab your car down before he uses it without asking, that's on him. \n\nYou had no idea you were doing anything wring, because you weren't.", "Yta for not letting your husband know. A text is two seconds work.", "YTA. All you had to do was let him know not to go in that car.", "Need more info. You told him all these clearly, in a way he can understand. Right?\n\n\n>He's demanding an apology, and I refused so he's been staying at his brother's house since Sunday night saying that he doesn't 'feel safe' around me because I 'don't regret putting his life in danger'. I don't think that what I did was wrong so I haven't apologised. I did apologise for the whole thing happening but not for not telling him about the car. AITA for this?", "INFO: Did your husband 1) text you to ask to borrow your car while you were napping; 2) did he know you were napping, hence why he may not have texted you in the first place?", "NAH. I realize it shouldn't have caused a problem so technically you didn't do anything 'wrong'. But that was a scary as hell experience for him. It went wrong and he's the one who faced a life threatening scare. To double down and not give an apology when it would diffuse the situation that could be as simple as \"I am sorry that happened.\" seems way off to me.\n\nEdit-sorry I overlooked the last line.", "YTA. What\u2019s wrong with you, why do you even eat it at home? Are you trying to cause reactions because that\u2019s how I see it.", "ESH\n\nYour husband clearly overdramatizes what has happened.

Is he waiting for the fuel fairy to come overnight to top his tank up before he needs the car again?\n\nHas he not taken any notice of the fact that you are taking drastic steps to ensure the seafood you crave and are able to digest is kept away from him?

Going to go with NAH. He's probably freaked out from (what sounds like) a near death experience, but you've already apologized and don't deserve to be treated like a pariah. The only thing I would consider apologizing for/acknowledging is that eating it in your car was outside of the established \"routine\" he's likely become used to. Your reason for eating in the car makes sense (raining, didn't want to bring it in the house), but he's probably focusing on the fact that you didn't say something like \"hey I got some seafood but since it's raining I'm eating it in the car\" when you initially got it.", "Wait so his car was low on fuel and instead of taking that car out to get more fuel and do whatever they needed to do, the decided it was a better idea to take your car?\n\nNTA, no apology needed", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Catastrophizing, black and white thinking, quick tempered?", "He should stay away and file for divorce", "**YTA.** Your husband is currently risking his life so you don\u2019t risk yours during the pregnancy (accepting without complain that you eat something that can kill him so you can can gain weight). The BARE MINIMUM is to let him know when you leave a deathly trap somewhere else than usual, specially indoors: *\u201cHey hun, it was raining so I had seafood in my car and cannot clean it now. Don\u2019t go in there. Love you!\u201d* See, not so hard, isn\u2019t it? Yet you couldn\u2019t be bother and now you are answering any message here as if *you* were the offended party because he wants a specific apology for not doing the bare minimum of warning him that, unless other times that it was the garden, the car was a place that could kill him\u2014 and almost actually did! He still needed to run to the ER after using his own epipen! What if he didn\u2019t make it time? What if the reaction after an accumulated exposure this past weeks was too bad already? So yeah, apologize to the person (your partner, the \u201clove of your life\u201d and father of your unborn child), who you almost killed, FFS. And do better! You are a couple, a partnership.", "If you had eaten in the garden, but didn't clean it before your nap, would you have texted him to let him know?", "At best, I feel like NAH and it was a miscommunication. Yes, he typically asks you to borrow your car but you were taking a nap, so I can see why he might not want to wake you to ask to borrow it. Since you typically eat seafood in the garden, it may not have crossed his mind that you ate seafood in the car or crossed your mind to text him. So it feels disingenuous to frame it as \"well he didn't ask me\" or \"he never uses my car\" (which you admit earlier isn't true, it's just that he *rarely* asks to use it).\n\nBUT I also don't think that your husband is being childish (contrary to how some people here are framing it in the comments) since this is a severe food allergy and you know it's a severe food allergy. Even if it was a miscommunication, the fact that you aren't willing to apologize feels callous and the fact is, you did put his life in danger even if it wasn't intentional. So while I would rule NAH, you should apologize.", "Sorry. I will change the judgement. But giving him that might reassure him it won't happen again. It was probably traumatic what he went through.", "To determine whether OP had the opportunity to eat somewhere else or not", "Did they not have a sit-in option? If your husband's allergy is that severe I'd be on high alert all the time and not even risk in your car, not having cleaned it afterwards. That being said, NAH. Your husband had a major scare, and it was your car ultimately. Everyone's tensions are high right now.", "That's a key piece of information. It's really strange that you didn't include it in the original post.", "In strange surroundings, sure. I would hope I didn't have to do it in places where I go all the time, where the people I love and trust are aware of the danger to me.\n\nMy sister has life threatening allergies. This situation would not have happened back when she and I were living together. And if by some strange chance it did, I would have felt terrible about it.", "I don\u2019t think OP is being too stubborn here at all. OP has apologized for the situation, and the right thing to do from both parties is to communicate and figure out how to avoid this situation in the future. Instead, the husband has abandoned his 6mo pregnant wife and is refusing to come home, and he has seemingly put all blame on OP.", "Empathy and compassion are sorely lacking on this sub. Apologizing is not that hard.", "And OP has said they have said sorry for the incident happening, she's just not ok with taking blame where it's not warranted. He borrowed her car without permission or even a head's up, at a time that happened to be in the middle of a very very short window where she hadn't gotten around to cleaning up her car after eating. This was unlucky, and could have been prevented had he asked to borrow the car. She's right not to accept blame for him basically stealing her car and having an allergic reaction to it.", "Anyone should be asking before they borrow someone else's car, even if it's your spouse's. It sounds like it's very very rare that he's ever in her car, and she was going to clean it after a nap, so in a very timely manner. \n\nHim blaming her is absolutely outrageous. \n\n\nMy partner is severely allergic to peanuts, there's no way I would have warned her that I ate peanuts in my car before taking a nap, on the off chance that she might decide to go in there. That's just ridiculous.", "She\u2019s later explained that he does know, she\u2019s not sneaking it and he even orders it for her sometimes.", "She said in a reply to a comment that he knew she was craving and eating seafood. I actually don't believe he should've made sure the car was seafood free before he used it. I also don't believe she's reckless for not thinking to text him and let him know, like she said he never uses it. How is she supposed to foresee that despite him never using her car, within the short window of time she had a nap he would be low on fuel and decide to use her car without asking?", "She\u2019s not sneaking, she is using her own car and eating outside specifically because she is taking precautions to protect him from exposure.", "It's pretty clear he could have. He has an epi-pen (in other responses). Those are for potentially fatal reactions.", "It would be highly unlikely. He always carries around an epi pen, and we live in a city with many hospitals so he can quickly get further treatment.", "There are 2 cars, one belonging to OP and one belonging to husband. Read the info. Also there\u2019s no such thing as once you\u2019re married everything is co-owned automatically, co-shared likely", "we have separate cars", "He's not usually quick tempered but when he does get angry, he is dramatic and catastrophising", "Yeah. I always clean the garden so if I was too tired to do it I would let him know. He avoids the garden for his own safety, but he will occasionally smoke there.", "They do have a sit in option but they were about to close so I wasn't going to make them wait for me", "I assumed that most of the people here would understand that him knowing that I crave and consume his allergen is a given.", "She specifically stated that he never uses her car, so it is not actually a place he goes all the time.", "Like I said, he's being super petty, but going out of your way to say \"I'm sorry it happened but I'm not sorry I forgot to tell you I ate fish in the car\" is also petty.", "He got exposed. She should have told him or text. She knew full well, he is severely allergic. That kind of accident could have been fatal\nand preventable. She should.just apologize if that's all he wants.  They're married ffs and having a baby. Good luck.", "But his chances of death in the future just went up. I now carry two epipens because one isn\u2019t enough. YTA", "Unlikely but could have happened. I'd be much more remorseful if I'd almost killed my husband.", "Highly unlikely but not impossible. If I was him I would be seriously reconsidering the marriage since you have made it abundantly clear you don\u2019t care about his health and will recklessly endanger his life and then refuse to apologise for doing so. \nFYI YTA", "Even with hospital treatment, you can die from anaphylaxis. Also, having an anaphylaxis reaction is terrifying. You cannot breathe. Imagine being suffocated. Terrifying. Imagine having a pregnant wife at home and being near death. Terrifying.  \n\nI have almost died a few times, in the hospital, due to severe allergic reaction. It rattles you for a while.", "Yes, there is such a thing. That can happen legally, but it should happen practically. That's the point of a union.", "All you had to do was shoot him a text. The fact that you knew you had to clean it knew there was a possibility of hum being in there. Apologize and raise your kid together.", "Ah, I see. NTA obviously but you guys should see a couples therapist for a few pre-baby sessions. It must be very hard to live with a condition like that but he also must have learned how to expect and cope with random incidents like this one. The fact that he handled this situation in such a childlike manner makes me think he is under quite a bit of stress.", "Tbh on AITA, it's not an assumption people will make; there have been plenty of posts where people hide things like this from their partner. Best practice is to ask not assume because assuming can lead to an inaccurate judgement.", "I'm with you.  Never occurred to me he wouldn't know that.", "I was remorseful untill he started yelling at me for being reckless and selfish. I've already apologised for the miscommunications and for the situation even happening, he wants me to apologise for 'recklessly' putting him in danger because I never told him about a car he has used maybe 4 times in the past two years, all events that he sought permission for.", "Since he never uses it I don't think it's much of a stretch for her to assume it was a safe space. I feel like it's just bad luck that day he was running low on fuel used her car without asking within the window she was asleep. When unfortunate situations like this one occur I feel like people are so keen to place blame on someone and claim it was easily avoidable because the idea it was mainly down to bad luck and unfortunate circumstances makes people highly uncomfortable.", ">The fact that you knew you had to clean it knew there was a possibility of hum being in there\n\nHe rarely uses my car. I was going to clean so that when I used it again, I would carry any allergens on me to pass on to him. I can count the times he's been in my car on one hand and I've had my car for two years.", "Extremely harsh to be describing the literal near-death incident as 'catastrophizing'. This type of allergy is a very real potential catastrophe if you're getting slopping with contamination.", "Because he could have died. The end. your child would have lost his father because you couldn't have been bothered to mention you ate something he's deathly allergic to. Whatever any counter argument you may have? He could have died. Hopefully your kid doesn't inherit the allergy because you are far too careless around adults.", "You are NTA, he should absolutely asked for permission to borrow your car, and then this whole thing would have been avoided. You shouldn't have to take any blame for him basically stealing your car. Apologising for the situation in general and feeling bad about that is absolutely enough. He needs to take some responsibility for his own actions. He knows you've been needing to eat seafood, you usually eat outside, but it was raining. He should be on high alert for situations that could be dangerous to him. Instead, he does something out of the ordinary, invades your own personal property and space, and then blames you for having had the audacity of eating the food you need to in your own private and personal space. \n\nHe is being completely unreasonable, and I hope he comes to his senses soon. I can understand that after a scare like this, his reactions are a bit more extreme than usual, but if he continues this way after he has gotten over the initial scare, that's on him.", "Okay, then you're not the asshole. Don't simply apologize and talk it out. Enjoy being a single mom. Btw, I'm not letting him off the hook either. He's a dramatic fucking child. You two sound perfect to raise a kid.", "I don't mean that at all. I was referring to him saying \"I don't feel safe around you\" comment.", "If he's going to keep behaving like this,  then I will enjoy being a single mum.", "And probably recklessly endanger your child like you did your husband.", "Personally, I think you two should work it out. Seems like you two deserve each other.", "thanks for your input?"]}
