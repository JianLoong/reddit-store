We were supposed to have only one party with both sides of the family, but my sister-in-law and her husband live far away (they have not meet our baby yet, the last time we saw them was before the plague), and they postponed their visit for a week, so we had a party with my side of the family (my mom, my two siblings and their partners) last week, and another party yesterday, with my husband's side (his mom, my SiL and her husband).\n\nAs you can see, it was 2 very small gatherings. Basically, both times, we did the same thing : a meal, a cake, they gave gifts to the baby, fawned over him, took 1 billion pictures and videos, and we chatted while the baby napped for half of the party. \n\nI'm breastfeeding so I don't drink any alcohol, and my husband doesn't like alcohol much, so he stopped along with me. We didn't even think about buying alcohol for the parties (because the last time we've bought alcohol was like... 2 years ago, lol)\n\nI thought the party with my family-in-law went well and everyone was happy, until I received a text from my MiL this morning, asking me why I didn't serve alcohol, and that it was poor taste to neglect my guests. It seems my SiL is very upset because of me, because she thinks I was cheap when they came all the way to see us and bring gifts for our baby.\nTo be clear, my husband was the one who planned the second party, and he bought sodas and juices because that's what he wanted to buy, I don't know why I'm being blamed.\n\nThe thing is, not serving alcohol for a party IS rare and kinda weird here, but my family didn't say anything about it, so we just went with the same plan for the second party..\n\nAnd before anyone says anything about my husband, he called his mom and asked what the hell was going on, and said if they're not happy with our way of hosting, they don't have to come next time.\n\nI guess I'm asking if we are the a**hole because it seems extreme to not have them over again for such a small issue, we can just buy alcohol next time.", "created_utc": 1682862162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133riym/aita_for_not_serving_alcohol_at_my_babys_1st/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely not.\n\n(Especially if it was a party during the day. You don't specify, but since you said he \"napped\" for half the party, instead of saying you put him to bed, I would guess it was a daytime party.

If your in-laws require alcohol at every gathering, they can bring their own. It\u2019s up to you, the hosts, whether you want to provide alcohol.

Forget about all this rubbish your MIL is spewing about who has a party and doesn't serve alcohol, it's more to the point to ask A) who expects to go to an extremely small *one year olds birthday and be given alcohol* and B) if the invitees to said party are so addicted to alcohol that they can't eat *one* meal without it affecting their whole day, night *and* the next day's breakfast, then they should have brought their own alcohol. Or was the alcohol in payment for the gifts? Perhaps that's how it works on that side of the family - if you want gifts, you not only supply food and cake, but you also have to supply the sort of bottomless and refillable cup not seen since Harry Potter got Hagrid and Slughorn drunk after Aragog died (and we all know how that ended don't we?). \n\nYour husband showed the sort of spine usually only seen on reruns of Jurassic Park (looking at you stegosaurus); don't undo all his good work!

I get what your saying about alcohol being served at most parties as it is the same way in my family but getting upset and actually calling someone out about not having alcohol at a baby\u2019s birthday (or any party for that matter) party is just ridiculous.", "NTA.

You are totally NTA.", "NTA.\n\nLook, I quite like to take a drink, and I am child free and not a huge fan of children's parties, but you know, I don't go on a bender when I go to my niblings parties. \n\nDid I pour myself a very large G&T when I got back from spending a few hours at a trampoline park with a dozen 10 year olds? Yes. Yes I did. But I didn't bring a nip in my purse, because adults should be able to handle some social occasions sober. \n\nIf your SIL needed a drink so much, why not bring a bottle of wine?  That's the socially acceptable way to make a child's party more interesting.", "NTA. I would not go to a child's birthday party and expect alcohol. I'm there for the cake and punch. I bring gifts and celebrate the kid. Every party does not require alcohol.", "It's understood that a first birthday is for the adults rather than the kids...\n\nBut I have never been to a first birthday party that had an expectation of alcohol!\n\nEvery one of these parties has had a ton of soft drink but never alcohol. \n\nGetting all indignant about not being served alcohol at a baby's birthday party is just all kinds of extra! \n\nNTA\n\nAlso these people are adults. They could have used their big boy/girl words and asked about alternative drinks. Someone could have gone and bought some booze if it was so fucking essential (that's what people in my family do when there isn't enough/ what someone wants).", "NTA, its a 1 year olds birthday party (congrats btw). Even if other people might serve alcohol you are totally within your rights not too, and your in-laws sound incredibly unpleasant.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d never have thought alcohol went with a child\u2019s birthday party. \n\nI don\u2019t drink, so when we do have people over I don\u2019t have alcohol (not opposed to it, just have no reason to have it on hand). No one has ever complained. \n\nYour in-laws must really drink a lot to expect this.", "NTA, but you can avoid this in the future by telling people it\u2019s BYOB beforehand. \nIt is nice to know whether or not there will be alcohol at an event. But I would never dream of complaining to a host if they didn\u2019t serve booze. That\u2019s so rude on their part.", "NTA.

You are in no obligation to serve alcohol. Your in-laws are acting entitled.", "NTA.

I was only 3 years sober at the time, and chose to have a dry wedding.  I honestly had never been to a dry wedding before (and also had never been to wedding that didn\u2019t result in drunken fighting), and I was looking forward to having my wedding on my terms.  To our dismay, we were scolded for not supplying alcohol.  Quite a few family members refused to attend, and everybody had left our wedding reception by 9PM (several hours early).

I've done that at small family parties when I wanted or someone wanted something.\n\nThe only thing I disagree with is people saying \"its a one year old's birthday, alcohol is not appropriate\" culture plays a role in when and where people drink.

If we are talking a cooked meal rather than a buffet at lunch then also more odd not to, as a 1 year old isn't joining in with the food and really it's not forming a 1 year old party function. It's more a family dinner coinciding with the birthday with cake served. Also you are in France so also well known for alcohol with lunch and dinner so I guess easily seen as bad hosting. If you viewed it as a 1 year old party then I can see your side, but it sounds like they viewed it as a family dinner coinciding with a birthday and expected the norm they would get with a proper meal.

Your SIL can be annoyed and complain to her mom. I think SIL was unreasonable but that's okay.
