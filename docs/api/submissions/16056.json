Absolutely not.\n\n(Especially if it was a party during the day. You don't specify, but since you said he \"napped\" for half the party, instead of saying you put him to bed, I would guess it was a daytime party.

If your in-laws require alcohol at every gathering, they can bring their own. It\u2019s up to you, the hosts, whether you want to provide alcohol.

Forget about all this rubbish your MIL is spewing about who has a party and doesn't serve alcohol, it's more to the point to ask A) who expects to go to an extremely small *one year olds birthday and be given alcohol* and B) if the invitees to said party are so addicted to alcohol that they can't eat *one* meal without it affecting their whole day, night *and* the next day's breakfast, then they should have brought their own alcohol. Or was the alcohol in payment for the gifts? Perhaps that's how it works on that side of the family - if you want gifts, you not only supply food and cake, but you also have to supply the sort of bottomless and refillable cup not seen since Harry Potter got Hagrid and Slughorn drunk after Aragog died (and we all know how that ended don't we?). \n\nYour husband showed the sort of spine usually only seen on reruns of Jurassic Park (looking at you stegosaurus); don't undo all his good work!

I get what your saying about alcohol being served at most parties as it is the same way in my family but getting upset and actually calling someone out about not having alcohol at a baby\u2019s birthday (or any party for that matter) party is just ridiculous.", "NTA.

You are totally NTA.", "NTA.\n\nLook, I quite like to take a drink, and I am child free and not a huge fan of children's parties, but you know, I don't go on a bender when I go to my niblings parties. \n\nDid I pour myself a very large G&T when I got back from spending a few hours at a trampoline park with a dozen 10 year olds? Yes. Yes I did. But I didn't bring a nip in my purse, because adults should be able to handle some social occasions sober. \n\nIf your SIL needed a drink so much, why not bring a bottle of wine?  That's the socially acceptable way to make a child's party more interesting.", "NTA. I would not go to a child's birthday party and expect alcohol. I'm there for the cake and punch.

Every party does not require alcohol.", "It's understood that a first birthday is for the adults rather than the kids...\n\nBut I have never been to a first birthday party that had an expectation of alcohol!\n\nEvery one of these parties has had a ton of soft drink but never alcohol. \n\nGetting all indignant about not being served alcohol at a baby's birthday party is just all kinds of extra! \n\nNTA\n\nAlso these people are adults. They could have used their big boy/girl words and asked about alternative drinks. Someone could have gone and bought some booze if it was so fucking essential (that's what people in my family do when there isn't enough/ what someone wants).", "NTA, its a 1 year olds birthday party (congrats btw). Even if other people might serve alcohol you are totally within your rights not too, and your in-laws sound incredibly unpleasant.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d never have thought alcohol went with a child\u2019s birthday party. \n\nI don\u2019t drink, so when we do have people over I don\u2019t have alcohol (not opposed to it, just have no reason to have it on hand). No one has ever complained. \n\nYour in-laws must really drink a lot to expect this.", "NTA, but you can avoid this in the future by telling people it\u2019s BYOB beforehand. \nIt is nice to know whether or not there will be alcohol at an event. But I would never dream of complaining to a host if they didn\u2019t serve booze. That\u2019s so rude on their part.", "NTA.

You are in no obligation to serve alcohol. Your in-laws are acting entitled.", "NTA.

Alcohol definitely wouldn't make it easier for me to get through my work day. I'd be messing shit up constantly and having to go back and figure out how to fix it, with the same drunk brain that messed it up in the first place.", "In my humble opinion, a baby's first birthday part is a kid-centric event.  Alcohol should not be expected at an infant's birthday party", "It depends on the culture really.\n\n1st Birthday parties in many countries are largely a party for adults, not the kids.", "You haven\u2019t lived until you have seen a 1 year old drunk off a breast milk mimosa /s", "Who serves booze at a 1 year old bday party?? NTA", "I think it's funny those \"tests\" to see if you're an alcoholic.  If you're an alcoholic you'll know it, if you are a naughty boy and have a bloody mary or two every sunday... you are not an alcoholic.\n\nBut yeah, getting mad that there are no cocktails at a 1 year old's party... Either you're worth a trillion dollars and are that out of touch with normal people, or you've got some serious introspection to do.  Question 1) Do you get mad that toddlers aren't serving alcohol when they clearly got you there under false pretenses?", "Yeah, SIL is probably an alcoholic.", "If you haven't already, I would tell them exactly that. You don't normally have alcohol in the house, and so you don't think about getting it just because people will be over. That's completely fair. Perhaps tell them that they are welcome to bring wine over. My parents host gatherings often, and my sister and I are often the bringers of wine and liquor. It's not a strange deal to bring your own alcohol, providing that you are okay with it of course.", "They could have brought some (provided you approved). NTA", "Psst. OP... May I recommend you folks get some good mocktail recipes under your belt? Even if just for yourselves? All the fun of alcoholic cocktails, none of the alcohol!", "Sounds like they like whines too", "I wouldn't worry about it - from the sounds of it, there was enough whine to go around.", "Seems like they brought their own whine anyway", "The problem wasn\u2019t wine, but whine from your MIL!", "NTA, and I don't know what MIL is complaining about.\nShe got a good whine in the end", "You didn\u2019t think about wine because it was a one year olds birthday party!! Shame on them for thinking they should\u2019ve had alcohol!! NTA never invite them to a party again! And I wouldn\u2019t attend their parties either", "You were mistaken. They like whines, not wines.", "It\u2019s a baby\u2019s birthday, so I could see why you wouldn\u2019t think about buying wine.  Your MIL may have an alcohol problem, and/or could be hyper critical.", "Wine is a dinner drink and while there\u2019s no reason to judge people for drinking it earlier there\u2019s also no reason to expect it earlier??? Honestly though even if these were dinner parties\u2026 it\u2019s still a 1 y/os birthday so I really don\u2019t understand how they built any expectation of having wine???", "It\u2019s kid\u2019s birthday party, not an adult cocktail party.  You not thinking about alcohol is normal, mil whining about no alcohol kind of screams that she may have a drinking problem.", "Please show me where you can buy a wine bottle that you need two hands to carry. I'd love one.", "3yo party recently. We had cans of beer and cider, plus Coke, ginger beer, juice and water, because a few hours with 15 toddlers running around could drive anyone to drink!!"]}
