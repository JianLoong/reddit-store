It's even WORSE that they are brothers- certainly not better. You sound like a horrible mother to be honest...why is your son paying your bills?? Why are you not upset with Jack for not only stealing James' gf but IMPREGNATING her when he clearly is not stable enough to properly care for them??", "OP, YTA. \n\nCould I ask you why your only concerns are what is best for you and Jack?  What do you think is in James best interest?  I mean you have obviously chosen Jack over James, that is clear, but do you have enough basic human compassion to understand that people may need to do what is best for James?", "You are. You\u2019re the perfect example of why people don\u2019t listen to their mother. All you want is for James to clean up Jacks mess and take a bit more $$$ from him. Tell Jack to step up.", "Jack hasn't even apologized - it's not in anyone's best interest to forgive someone who isn't remorseful.", "Being their mother, doesn't automatically make you right. Your golden child fucked around and now is facing the consequences. It's not James' responsibility to apologize for Jack fucking up. And even if Jack did apologize first, James is under no obligation to forgive them in the best of circumstances. You are now putting your relationship with James on the line and it sounds like if you keep pushing this issue, James is going to go at least LC with you if not completely NC. I hope you enjoy only having one son.", "You're probably right. Hoping for OP sake she hasn't completely lost her son.", "He\u2019s paying rent for you, his cheating brother and the three affair babies - he sounds like he has helped family quite enough.", "With all due respect, you should have taught Jack that before he slept with his brother\u2019s girlfriend. The very first lesson of \u201chelping family 101\u201d is do not have an affair with your sibling\u2019s partner!", "Helping the person, that fcked his then GF?", "I didn\u2019t realize helping family meant getting their girlfriend pregnant. Jack lost the right to ask his brother for help a long time ago. You should stop asking for him.", "Why should he help the people who hurt him? How is forcing him to act as a father to the byproduct of his brother cuckolding him a good thing for the family? Is it just that it allows an illusion of peace for you so you don't have to deal with the consequences of Jack's actions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJack is the one who needs to step up. His actions causes this. James has no reason to forgive him.  Why is James seen as the bad guy for literally being the victim of his brothers actions? Why should he swallow his hurt for your own comfort?", "The only lessons he\u2019s learnt from his family is he can\u2019t trust anyone and even family can betray you. Jack did all this to himself.  James owes him nothing. He doesn\u2019t owe money, help, or forgiveness. Maybe you should teach jack there are consequences to his actions that he has to live with and if you betray someone, that person owes you nothing, and you have to learn to live with that. YTA and a horrible disgusting excuse for a parent. I hope he does stop paying your rent. You and your golden child can figure it out together.", "I think Jack tossed that out the window when he boned his brothers girlfriend.", "You should have taught Jack a lesson about not betraying family. You failed.", "You should have taught Jack those family values before he screwed his BROTHER's girlfriend. Now it's a bit late for you to try being a good parent.", "NO you need to teach JACK the lesson of family because you do not cheat on family.", "Try to teach Jack that steal something from his brother is a bad thing. A toy, the last cookie or even his girlfriend...", "You should probably be teaching Jack how to not screw over family instead", "He made a mistake and now he\u2019s dealing with the consequences of his actions. It\u2019s called being an adult. James has no obligation here.", "You're delusional. I hope James stops paying your rent and you and Jack have more consequences to deal with for your bullshit.", "He hasn\u2019t even apologized. Jack is not a son I\u2019d be proud of.", "A mistake is 'I forgot to replace the gas I used when I borrowed your car.\" Falling dick first into your brother's girlfriend's vagina is not a 'mistake' but a deliberate act. Quit glossing over your son's betrayal of his brother. You ABSOLUTELY are favoring Jack. Knock it off and stop being an asshole to James. You could not be more of an asshole to James if you tried. You cannot possibly be that oblivious.", "Jack made his bed and must deal with the consequences. It\u2019s fine if you wish to help him, but Jack made the conscious decision to sleep with his brother\u2019s girlfriend (and she made the decision to sleep with him). They have to deal with the fact that that means James won\u2019t forgive them. The children aren\u2019t James\u2019s responsibility. He is not obligated. Yes, they\u2019re innocent but sometimes it\u2019s not about the kids. \n\nHis brother betrayed him and he can see who Mommy\u2019s favorite child is.", "He\u2019s not been punished severely enough.", "He\u2019s not being punished. It\u2019s called dealing with consequences. Lol. YTA.", "That\u2019s hilarious", "Punished? No.\n\nDealing with the consequences of his actions? Yes.", "How??? He\u2019s not owed James\u2019 money. This isn\u2019t a punishment, this is the results of his own decisions. If he hadn\u2019t slept with that girl then the 3 kids wouldn\u2019t be here and draining his wallet.", "He\u2019s not being punished, these are just the consequences of his actions. \n\nWhat aren\u2019t you getting here? There are mistakes too big to come back from sometimes. This is one of those mistakes.", "Kids aren't really \"punishment\", now are they? They are CONSEQUENCES. Jack slept with his brother's GF, got her pregnant, and is living with the results. That's not punishment. That's what happens when adults mess around without condoms.\n\nJames owes them (and you) nothing. Jack is struggling because he couldn't keep his business in his pants and he didn't wear his rubbers before getting wet. James plays no part in that whatsoever.\n\nESH - except James. He's cool.", "Jack knowingly had unprotected sex and fathered children. That is 100% on him. No one else has ANY responsibility to those children other than Jack and the mother. On top of this, Jack betrayed his brother by having an affair with his brother's girlfriend. You raised a very shitty, entitled son. \n\nNow, you are expecting James to fix Jack's problems, and you are threatening to boycott his wedding in order to emotionally manipulate him. You are a terrible parent. You and Jack absolutely deserve whatever happens to you. I hope James and his new wife cut you out of their lives for good so you can finally learn what it means to be a responsible adult.", "So you believe children are a punishment?", "No, you don\u2019t. You made sure you ignored the most relevant parts of my comment, didn\u2019t you? All you care about is poor little Jack who put HIMSELF in a shitty situation! Why don\u2019t you tell him to step up? They\u2019re HIS KIDS. I truly don\u2019t give a shit why he pays part of it, he needs to stop. You are a terrible mother. James needs to go full no contact with the lot of you. He deserves so much better.", "You absolutely do not love your children equally. Love is an action. It's not some amorphous feeling. You love Jack more and you see James as the family's cash machine.", "Then he shouldn\u2019t have fucked his brothers wife YTA", "I mean Jack obviously didn\u2019t give a shit about the familial relationship when he fucked James\u2019 girlfriend. Jack ruined his own life, why does anyone owe him anything?", "No, how about don't sleep with your brother's gf? Jack got what he had coming and I have no sympathy for him. I'm shocked you even got an invite to the wedding. Let's be clear, just because you have birth to them doesn't mean you get a say in their lives.", "YTA in a big big biiiig way\nYour son Jack f@cked around and found out! This s called karma.", "But James and Jack used to always have their back. James used to say \"If there is a problem with one of us, there is a problem with all of us.\" Is just too sad that he doesnt say that anymore.", "THIS \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s Reddit Triplets Real!", "The nieces account, maybe? \n\nOP, YTA.", "My niece allowrd me to use her account for this post", "And I bet Jack didn\u2019t used to get James\u2019 girlfriend pregnant", "That was before jack betrayed his brother\u2019s trust by fucking his girlfriend. YTA.", "Yes, the fact that he doesn\u2019t say it anymore is Jack\u2019s fault. James is helping support Jack if Jack is living with you and James is helping with the rent. \nI cannot believe you suggested he play a fatherly role in this case. Jack is living the consequences to his own actions.", "I\u2019m not surprised, I would have laughed in your face too. James doesn\u2019t owe Jack shit. Trying to tell him to step up as a parent is just gross. I hope he leaves both of you in the rear view mirror and stops paying your rent. The gall of you..", "That became null and void when he fucked his bother\u2019s girlfriend. YTA.", "Until you fuck his girl", "Jack lost that privilege when he decided to blow Sarah\u2019s back out. Asshole didnt even found five minutes to apologize. YTA.", "That's when he thought Jack respected him, and had HIS back. After what Jack did? It's every man for themselves!", "If your sibling banged your spouse and got pregnant would you help raise the kids? Give you head out of your ass and stop favouring one child over the other", "Can\u2019t you see the betrayal has permanently altered their relationship?", "Well \u201cshe\u201d is selfish like you and Jack.", "She said that she agrees that family should help family so I dont think I am in the wrong", "Bwahahahaha", "How did Jack help his brother by sleeping with his girlfriend??  Don\u2019t say it was a mistake.  It wasn\u2019t.", "Well, your niece is an AH, too.", "You most definitely are in the wrong.", "So why aren't you helping James? Why is forgiving Jack helping the family but standing up for James and letting Jack suffer the consequences of his actions not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou said James helps pay your rent in another comment- He is already \"helping the family\" way more than he needs to IMO."]}
