Ignore your MIL.", "NTA - this is abusive and grounds for divorce.", "NTA, protect yourself and your baby and stay away from that man. Contact a family law attorney immediately.", "How did things get so bad? This is really extreme behavior on his part and his parents being shocked implies that you weren\u2019t having obvious problems in the relationship. This is a deal breaker for me.

Your husband failed both you and your child in a way that could\u2019ve been life threatening. Beyond that, he lacks even basic respect for you.

He'd be signing a birth certificate one day and divorce papers the next. I'd have lost my ever loving mind", "Definitely NTA. I agree with everyone else saying file for Divorce. I\u2019m sorry you had to find out that your husband is not mature enough to be a father, much less a husband. Be thankful you\u2019re young enough to rebuild your life. It\u2019s going to be hard but you can do it. Eventually you\u2019ll find someone who genuinely loves you and treats you with respect.", "Is the baby doing well? You said they were in the nicu I really hope everything is ok for baby and mom!  I also really hope that it wasn\u2019t  because you couldn\u2019t get to the hospital in time.

Your MIL probably wants the \u201cfamily\u201d to stay together but you have every right to not want that. Something terrible could have happened and your AH husband would rather play video games.", "NTA....but your husband is. Nice to know your health and the health of your baby comes second to his precious gaming time.  If I were you, he'd be ex husband very soon", "NTA. That would be the last time he talked to me in person. He'd never see the baby. He endangered you  and your baby's life. And he obviously has the maturity of a 12 year old (his brother as well, I know a lot of 17 year olds who would NEVER behave that way).", "NTA. He doesn't respect or love you if that's how he treats you. Don't feel like you have to forgive him for this. He was incredibly callous and put your\u2014and your baby's\u2014life at risk. For me, that would be relationship-ending. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your baby.", "NTA. It\u2019s always going to be like this.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve some time to really rethink about your relationship with your husband. What he did was extremely shitty and he put yours and the baby\u2019s health at risk just because he couldn\u2019t pause the game.  It\u2019ll do him some good to really reflect on his actions and truly understand the consequences of it.\n\nAs for your MIL, I would remind her about what he did.  Your baby\u2019s life is/was because he chose to discard your concerns and refused to drive you to the hospital.  If and when you\u2019re ready to talk to him it would be on your terms, not his.  And she needs to accept that otherwise she\u2019ll lose her privilege to see her grandchild as well too.", "NTA. I'm sorry the father of your child is, well, like that.

I know it\u2019s all bullshit but curious to see how he or his parents are rationalizing his actions?", "NTA! He literally left you with no way to go for help after your water broke SIX WEEKS ahead of schedule! He endangered both you and your daughter\u2019s lives with his immature behavior. I\u2019d make sure your attorney knows ALL the details and that the judge is made aware too.

Absolutely not.", "NTA you are doing what's best for both you and your child. This is easy grounds for divorce", "Wow and the fact he left you there alone with no communication to get help.

Don't let him near the baby until custody etc are settled. If you can, move in with a family member, and get out of his parent's house.

Even if it was pee, he should have taken you in to get checked!  What was he doing all night?!  He didn't even come back to check on you.  You could have died!  Your child could have died.

FIL from your post sounds like he is on your side in this but is he just neutral and do you have any friends you can help you right now?", "Woah I always thought it meant \u201cnot an asshole\u201d thanks! Lol", "yea but pettiness can turn into resentment and do you really want to raise a child where both parents resent each other even if they are still married or co-parents?", "He always assured me that it would be different with a baby when I confronted him about this very issue and I always believed him, I don't think I could ever look at him the same. I thought he cared about me and the family we were starting together", "Yeah I heard of stories similar to that, his obsessive gamer always been a concern for me but everyone else always minimized it claiming that I was overreacting or being a \"killjoy\". \n\nHe also told me enough times that when the baby comes he'll put down his games for a bit", "He shouldn't have any right at all to ever lay eyes on that child! He actually did his best to make sure that that child never actually saw the light of day. Who gives a crap about his resentment? I'm fairly sure that most of those here do not.", "OP has every reason to resent her husband.  He put hers and their baby\u2019s life at risk because he chose to discard her concerns and game instead.  I don\u2019t know how relationships can come back.", "... ... yeah, just the mother surpressing that the father left her and the child to possibly die sounds soo much healthier than her doing what she thinks is best for her and the child because the father might resent her... we would want the father to resent this...", "She and the baby could have died because he\u2019s a selfish asshole who couldn\u2019t be bothered to care about the two of them more than a video game console and hanging out with his brother. The baby is in the NICU, and if his parents hadn\u2019t been home, it\u2019s likely that he would\u2019ve killed the baby through his incompetence and selfishness. OP has already started to resent him.", "I think she's gonna resent her ex husband no matter what happens next.", "Please leave if you are in the same household like today if possible. He is very immature to be a father or a husband. You also mentioned the NICU- you are aware of you got to the hospital quickly when your water broke you daughter would have had less of a NICU stay and health issues? \n\nI am a gamer and sometimes I get wrapped up in a good game but if someone-two someone\u2019s are in front of me having a medical emergency\u2026 damn I would be flying out of my seat and getting you medical care.\n\nHow are you and your child doing?", "You should never, ever look at him the same way. He has shown you that he cares more about gaming than you or your baby\u2019s life. You could have gone into labour alone at your in-laws\u2019 house and died. This man does not care about you at all.\n\nEdit to add that I hope you are coping okay and I wish you and your baby the best. You both deserve a far better man in your lives.", "You know those people you see that let their child literally starve to death or freeze because they can get off the game. Don't let that story be about your child.", "It won\u2019t be different. My friend and her baby almost died in a very similar situation. She went into labor, had no phone, and couldn\u2019t drive- he wouldn\u2019t take her to the hospital. It took years of abuse that escalated before she divorced him. He is showing you who he is. You and your baby could have died. You\u2019re an AH to yourself and baby if you stop standing your ground. His mother is showing who she is- she\u2019ll blindly defend him, and will most likely expose your baby to him without your permission. Tread carefully there. She probably thinks he\u2019ll suddenly grow up and mature because of your baby, but his first test was failed. She helped mold him to who he is. And his dad probably knows and sees exactly the kind of fuck up he is. \n\nConsult a lawyer. See how you need to document how he put your lives in danger. Your priority is now yourself and baby. Not the fully grown video game obsessed, anger issues, abusive (hopefully soon to be ex) husband. \n\nNTA. Congratulations on your baby, and sending you good energy to help get through this.", "He\u2019s showing you who he really is. Believe him. This will not get better.", "*For a bit*?\n\nThat doesn't sound a lot like \"I will prioritize my child and be an equal contributor in raising her\".\n\nSounds like his plan all along was to pat himself on the back for every diaper he changes and expect the same praise from you.", "My brother is one of those- current special ops and gamer. Not violent, but it is so hard to watch him neglect his wife and kiddos- nearly 10 years for them and it hasn\u2019t changed at all. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through an early birth on your own- NTA.", "That\u2019s like an alcoholic saying they can stop anytime they want to", "When I say resentment I mean both hers and his. Also no matter what in a legal battle they still going give him some type of custody. Many courts would give rapists/drug dealers partial custody now they shouldn't be getting any type of custody with those track records but still not much that can stop that.", "Communicating for one plus a lot of couple counseling. I'm also a therapist so Ik it possible but still really hard to do. The main focus now though should be the baby health/op health, once you become a parent everything else usually get put on the back burner for the child.", "If they want a divorce and court battles then go ahead but all I'm saying is don't use the kid as a weapon or use the kid against the other parent. Kid innocent in all of this.", "yea which sooner or later she going have to deal with that resentment, right now only thing important is child and OP health. the child future is also important. if she tries to turn that child away from the husband after the divorce then she could possibly lose custody of the child. alienating a parent can still apply. but also by law the mother already get custody of the child automatically unless OP husband can prove past drug abuse or violent tendencies.", "she will but she cant put that resentment onto the child since there also rules about alienating another parent which if caught doing that can switch custody or possibly lose custody of the child. right now since OP is the mother once she get the divorce she will have custody of the child since they also have laws dictating unless the mothers have past drug abuse problems or violent tendencies where you can prove it not safe they will automatically appoint the mother as main caretaker.", "Oh I'm definitely leaving, my brother changed the locks already on my behalf. \n\nMy baby is a fighter and is doing well it's just scary for me to see her in the incubator and everything but the doctors said she's likely to make it through so so I'm hopeful", "I personally think she should file assault charges against him or deliberate endangerment of both her and the child for the way he left her stranded and incommunicado. Let him explain that to a family judge and see how far he gets on a demand for any kind of custody. It certainly isn't going to be much very soon, given the poor child is still in a NICU.", "It should be, but the husband abandoned her to possibly die. So obviously her health and the baby\u2019s health means nothing to him.", "OP isn\u2019t ready to communicate with her husband.  Nor does it sound like she\u2019s ready to concern working things out with him right now.\n\nI agree once you have a child you a lot of things are put on the back burner for the welfare of the the child.  But how is telling OP to be the bigger person right now, especially since it\u2019s been less than a week of her baby\u2019s birth, and put her feelings aside going to make things better?  \n\nShe\u2019s emotionally burnt out, physically sore and in pain while all dealing with a baby in NICU where she\u2019s probably worry about the health and well-being of her long awaited baby.  At this time she doesn\u2019t owe her husband any time of day when she\u2019s just trying to make it through the day.", "If you\u2019re a licensed therapist, you shouldn\u2019t be pressuring a woman to \u201cnot resent\u201d a man who nearly killed her and her child.", "The child could have died because the child's father neglected his wife who could speak up. \n\nHow do we know the father won't do the same to the child, who literally can't advocate for themselves? The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.", "She needs space. That\u2019s totally valid. She shouldn\u2019t have to clear out of the hospital to let him visit the baby and she shouldn\u2019t have to be around him when she\u2019s in a vulnerable position and not ready.", "You should really stop commenting on the law because we don\u2019t know where OP lives so you have no clue whether what you think you know about the law applies.", "Your baby has a strong loving mother showing her how to fight. I wish you both well.", "Re: Change the locks- that's all I came here to say. Congrats on the baby- sending healing wishes their way.", "My son was born at 36 weeks. I completely understand how frightening that is. He was in an incubator, needed oxygen, and had trouble eating at first. He's a healthy adult now. There will be ups and downs as your daughter continues maturing while in the NICU. It will get better. If you need someone to talk to who has been through it before feel free to message me. You're doing great mama. Hang in there.", "It's scary but you got this! I am a NICU mom, it's so hard, but believe me you will have her home sooner than you think! You got this! Blessings to you both!!!", "Tbh actually don't know if it would count as assault charges. Don't think I ever heard someone pull it off. I'll do some research on that real quick to see if that actually possible. Usually people I help goes through this either get through it as a couple or just breakup/divorce but these type of situation differ since a lot of the ones I deal with are usually like the husband/boyfriend was at work and couldn't get there or tried to but got stuck in traffic.", "Well I'm not saying she has to do it this instant but it better to do it in near future instead of just taking it instantly to the courts.", "read my other comments. i also pointed out certain laws that can be taken into effect and possibilities which can dictate the child future.", "and how do we know if he going to be a shitty father? also using that saying don't mean much considering the courtrooms are known for letting rapists and drug dealers have partial or half custody a lot of the time. if he can put on an act saying child is safe with him the courts aint going second guess giving him custody.", "I mean it is better to point them out now so she at least knows their possibilities when discussing a lawyer. this stuff might also encourage her to research to see if these law applies where she lives.", "Those kind of scenarios are perfectly understandable. Life happens! This was more a deliberate action to show her his total contempt for her welfare or that of their child. You are right that assault probably would not stick, but under the totality of circumstances described, I do think criminal endangerment could seriously be on the table. And if not taken far enough to get him put in jail, it could be used to leverage protection for OP and her baby.", "He failed the entry exam to fatherhood.", "A father who would risk his kid\u2019s and wife\u2019s life is already a shitty father", "I definitely know criminal endangerment is on the table, just looked at paternity/pregnancy laws also possible pregnancy assault part of it but found nothing besides a few laws stating the father can lose custody if he wasn't part of the caretaking of the child preborn or post born but that also implies that if the mother told the father that they have a child. if it can be proven unknown then the father could sue for custody."]}
