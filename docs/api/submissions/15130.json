Ignore your MIL.", "NTA - this is abusive and grounds for divorce.", "NTA, protect yourself and your baby and stay away from that man. Contact a family law attorney immediately.", "How did things get so bad? This is really extreme behavior on his part and his parents being shocked implies that you weren\u2019t having obvious problems in the relationship. This is a deal breaker for me.

Your husband failed both you and your child in a way that could\u2019ve been life threatening. Beyond that, he lacks even basic respect for you.

He'd be signing a birth certificate one day and divorce papers the next. I'd have lost my ever loving mind", "Definitely NTA. I agree with everyone else saying file for Divorce. I\u2019m sorry you had to find out that your husband is not mature enough to be a father, much less a husband. Be thankful you\u2019re young enough to rebuild your life. It\u2019s going to be hard but you can do it. Eventually you\u2019ll find someone who genuinely loves you and treats you with respect.", "Is the baby doing well? You said they were in the nicu I really hope everything is ok for baby and mom!  I also really hope that it wasn\u2019t  because you couldn\u2019t get to the hospital in time.

Your MIL probably wants the \u201cfamily\u201d to stay together but you have every right to not want that. Something terrible could have happened and your AH husband would rather play video games.", "NTA....but your husband is. Nice to know your health and the health of your baby comes second to his precious gaming time.  If I were you, he'd be ex husband very soon", "NTA. That would be the last time he talked to me in person. He'd never see the baby. He endangered you  and your baby's life. And he obviously has the maturity of a 12 year old (his brother as well, I know a lot of 17 year olds who would NEVER behave that way).", "NTA. He doesn't respect or love you if that's how he treats you. Don't feel like you have to forgive him for this. He was incredibly callous and put your\u2014and your baby's\u2014life at risk. For me, that would be relationship-ending. Good for you for standing up for yourself and your baby.", "NTA. It\u2019s always going to be like this.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve some time to really rethink about your relationship with your husband. What he did was extremely shitty and he put yours and the baby\u2019s health at risk just because he couldn\u2019t pause the game.  It\u2019ll do him some good to really reflect on his actions and truly understand the consequences of it.\n\nAs for your MIL, I would remind her about what he did.  Your baby\u2019s life is/was because he chose to discard your concerns and refused to drive you to the hospital.  If and when you\u2019re ready to talk to him it would be on your terms, not his.  And she needs to accept that otherwise she\u2019ll lose her privilege to see her grandchild as well too.", "NTA. I'm sorry the father of your child is, well, like that.

I know it\u2019s all bullshit but curious to see how he or his parents are rationalizing his actions?", "NTA! He literally left you with no way to go for help after your water broke SIX WEEKS ahead of schedule! He endangered both you and your daughter\u2019s lives with his immature behavior. I\u2019d make sure your attorney knows ALL the details and that the judge is made aware too.

Absolutely not.", "NTA you are doing what's best for both you and your child. This is easy grounds for divorce", "Wow and the fact he left you there alone with no communication to get help.

Don't let him near the baby until custody etc are settled. If you can, move in with a family member, and get out of his parent's house.

By leaving the idiotic asshole who thought video games and hanging out with his brother are more important than his wife and the child she was in labor with. His negligence could have killed them both. You don\u2019t know where OP is located at. You don\u2019t know the laws there. If they\u2019re in the UK, it\u2019s not illegal. In the US it is. In Canada it\u2019s not illegal. Laws differ based on location. And yes, by law typically the default parent at birth is the mother, since the baby came out of the mother and they can confirm that she is the parent immediately, given that the dad doesn\u2019t typically pop a kid out of his vagina or have a baby removed from him via skylight. The birthing parent gets custody of newborns automatically because they are the proven parent and the baby relies on them for everything, especially if the baby is breast fed.", "Where did you say you received your credentials, Hulk?", "Same as my hubby but he won't ever risk mine or our kids health and safety and does his best to only game at times when we don't need him. \n\nOPs hubby won't accept that family comes before gaming. He could be an addict but that doesn't mean Op has to stay with him and risk her and her child's lives for him.", ">Some people think social workers are there to take your kids from you- they are NOT.\n\nTrue, it's their job to help those who can't save themselves on their own.", "who is? and how do you know?", "They typically take portions of other comments from the thread. There are several on here & you'll notice comments are slightly out of place as well.", "Just because someone donated DNA doesn\u2019t mean they are fit to be around a child. Ultimately, she has the only say when it comes to who is allowed in the NICU to see the baby. She has every right to protect her child. Her child will not resent her for protecting him while he was a premature infant in the NICU. lmfao It is right for her to protect her child. Lots of parents lose custody for their behavior. This guy clearly doesn\u2019t care about his kid and in a years time he will likely not even bother to try to visit, even if the court allows it.", "Good for you!  I hope your loser gamer husband enjoys cuddling his stupid video game console instead of his living, breathing wife and daughter.", "I was a 32-week baby! I'm in my 30's now with some health issues, but they probably weren't caused by me being born premature..", "You have a good head on your shoulder, I am glad you are so proactive in protecting yourself and your baby. Anger, when righteous, is a powerful tool for change and improvement. Don't let it govern your life but let it give you courage for what you need to do.\nAllow yourself to lean on those who support you, and best wishes for you two!", "Proud of you.", "So much love to you. My son came at 32 weeks, and the four weeks he spent in the NICU were the most emotionally trying of my life. He\u2019s home and thriving now, and you and your daughter WILL get there too. \n\nSending both of you healing thoughts.", "My twins were born at 33 weeks and were in NICU for 2 weeks. They are thriving almost 11 year olds. Your baby is a fighter and has a very strong by her side. \nDrop the d-bag husband who does not value you or your baby. You don\u2019t need him. Best of luck", "I was a 27-week baby and here I am with no health issues!,don\u2019t worry your baby will pull through,because she has a caring mother by her side and amazing doctors taking care of her for sure", "I was born two months premature and the photos I've seen looked pretty concerning from when I was born, like a tiny little peanut in an incubator. Perfectly fine and healthy now (as far as I know)", "Literally no one is putting guilt on OP, they\u2019re putting guilt on her soon to be ex husband", "Parent alienation is when one parent purposely turns on their child from the other parent. Not much to talk about danger considering OP already mention having her brother change the locks while still having the kid in her custody. All that left is the divorce and custody hearing if she fully goes through with it.", "First community college into a university college. It got most of the main credentials like English, math, science all out of the way where I could focus mainly on my degree when I got into the university. So 60 credits transferring into a 120 credit programs.", "Never mentioned it but university college in the United States.", "Actually both of those above are. One bot replied to the other.", "well, ok then! thanks", "Ring doorbells too!", "Sure, but for a lot of people that\u2019s not how it would feel, viscerally, to read that while their child is in an isolette in the NICU. It could also make her worry more about her daughter\u2019s health, when focusing on the ways her daughter\u2019s birth was like the thousands of other 34 weeker NICU grads who are thriving is generally more helpful, especially when her life has been blown up so spectacularly on top of something as stressful as being a NICU parent (especially as a first time parent!!)\n\nThat said - OP, if the doctors have told you there were any complications due to you coming in later in labor, obviously disregard that first paragraph, but if they haven\u2019t, please don\u2019t waste any emotional energy on the idea that getting to the hospital sooner could have meant a shorter NICU stay for your daughter.", "I will read your other comments if you read a book on trauma-informed feminist therapies - deal?", "The only person I can see who would instantly take it to the courts is the husband.  The OP literally has all the power in her hands and I doubt the court will favor the husband over the wife - especially if the father started off on the wrong foot.  So I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re urging OP to hurry up and open up communications to her husband out of fear he\u2019ll eventually resent her when she already has a lot on her plate.\n\nIf he\u2019s wise and actually wants to save the marriage, he would back off with the insistence of meeting his newborn baby who doesn\u2019t know anything beyond milk, poop, pee, and sleep\u2026 and focus on how to gain some forgiveness from OP.  Whether that\u2019s trying to give her space while provide things to help her (cleaning, cooking, midnight helps)\u2026 the last thing he should do is badger OP for rights to see their daughter.  He\u2019s in the dog house and a few weeks/months wouldn\u2019t hurt him.\n\nAnd the baby is a fresh newborn.  She\u2019s not going to notice the lack of her father\u2019s presence for the first few months\u2026 nor will it prevent her from building an eventual relationship with him.  But OP is a fully functional adult who\u2019s going to remember everything he does.  The husband is walking a very, VERY thin line and he better thread carefully otherwise OP will have more reasons to resent him than he resent her.", "Do you not get that the baby isn't in her house? The baby is in the hospital, in the NICU, and will probably be for at least the next month. That's how early it was, and how scary and dangerous the situation was. \n\nShe didn't change the locks on the hospital. She removed access to herself.\n\n\"Hey, Daddy, rememeber that time you almost killed me? Good times.\" is not a situation a child should grow up in.", "The information you\u2019re providing is inaccurate in the majority of jurisdictions. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t appear to be an idiot, so I think she\u2019ll know to look into her options without being exposed to inaccurate, outdated, and overly general legal babbling on the internet.", "Because he abandoned his wife while she was in early labor\n\nLike wtf dude", "crazy!", "Already have an abundance of articles/books that deals from dealing with affairs to emotional/physical abuse. Husband definitely was emotional abusive, one of her comments proved that. I private messages OP willing offer her some advice/going over choices while offering some stuff to read for after divorce like limited contact parenting apps for example ourfamilywizard co parent app and co-parenter app but got no reply. Both are pretty good apps truthfully both also are monitored so OP husband can't try anything. She already got a good support system which is needed so both her in-laws and her brother. Out of the 6 stages of healing from emotional abuse she in between the awakening and boundaries stage. The next two stages after that is restoration so focusing on your own health while preparing your next steps and maintenance which includes therapy, living conditions while still working on your own mental health.", "She already stated she having the locks change so he won't really have any way to really help.", "She had her brother change the locks so once they go home her husband can't get in. She also forbid her husband from seeing her or the child while at the hospital. That what I was mentioning."]}
