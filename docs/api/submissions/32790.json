This isn\u2019t abnormal for most kids, it\u2019s just abnormal for our family. Most of the adults in my family don\u2019t play that game with their kids, and we\u2019ve all been taught that Santa is a fictional character in a story, and that\u2019s some families like to pretend he\u2019s real. But, my brother (34M) chose to let his kids believe, and I always went along with it.\n\nThis year, however, Nora came home from school crying. She told me kids at school made fun of her for talking about her elf on the shelf. She said they called her a baby and told her it wasn\u2019t real. Then, she directly asked me if Santa was real. I was very conflicted in the moment because I think it\u2019s one thing to pretend, I never had the intention of ruining it for her. But, it\u2019s another to blatantly lie, and I felt uncomfortable doing that. I let her down gently, telling her that Santa is a game that adults play with kids, and now that she knows the secret, she gets to become Santa  for the younger kids and spread the Christmas magic herself. She took it surprisingly well. But, when my brother found out he absolutely lost his mind. He told me that it wasn\u2019t my place to tell her that, that I was TA for \u201ctaking away her childhood,\u201d and that I could\u2019ve very easily just told her not to listen to the kids at school.  \n\nAs someone who never believed, I\u2019m not really sure what age kids normally find out about this, and I figured if she was old enough to directly ask, it wasn\u2019t wrong to tell her the truth. I didn\u2019t have much time to think about it in the moment, but that was my very quick rationale.

She was told by people at school that Santa is not real and that she wanted the truth. You were truthful. There comes a point, and 10/11 is it where if a child asks directly you no longer deflect the answer and you give a direct answer. Then you loop them into the game so they can be an elf helper for little kids.\n\nKids are BRUTAL. Your brother is so caught up in clinging to this vestige of childhood that he has lost the plot on the fact that 4/5 grade is when kids will tell each other the truth. And by 6th grade if a kid still believes in Santa then they are considered weird, abnormal, a baby and they are legitimately made fun of. Its sad but its the world we live in.\n\nWhether you have ever believed or not is not the issue here and it never was.", "My sister is 11, turning 12 next week. She still believed until recently. Every year since she was around 8, we were thinking it would be the last year she believed, because she kept asking questions about Santa but never \"is he real?\". We weren't going to tell her about it without prompting, but if she ever asked, we were going to tell her the truth. She finally asked my parents a few weeks ago, and so they told her. She was totally cool with it. I am much older than her and she's homeschooled so she didn't have other kids around her to tell her otherwise. It was honestly really refreshing to be able to talk about Christmas stuff with her when she visited last week and not have to censor myself with the Santa talk. I'd say NTA. She asked, you answered. And it sounds like she handled it well. You didn't just go to her on a whim and tell her, she came to you looking for an answer.", "NTA - From the title and start, I thought you just told her because you felt she should know, but that wasn't the case. She asked because she was looking for the truth, she trusted you to tell her the truth, and you did. You're not the asshole for being honest and putting it in an appropriate way when she directly asked you a question.\n\nYou didn't take away her childhood, and there can still be magic at Christmas for her, just in a different way.", "NTA.\n\n11 is way too late, her parents were setting her up for a *terrible* time once she got close to high school, if they kept at it.", "NTA\n\nKids deserve to be told the truth when they ask a direct question. You answered her in a way that she could understand & didn\u2019t upset her further. \n\nI\u2019m of the mind kids are ready to learn things when they start asking direct questions.", "NTA and you handled it beautifully. We made up Santa to make sure kids never forget the importance of wonder, kindness and hope and how you explained that now she knew the secret, she could be Santa for other kids was so very sweet. It sounds like she's got a good head on her shoulders.", "NTA - She asked you, because she trusts you to speak the truth. Your explanation was very lovely, by the way. \n\nWhat was your brother thinking? He would still lie to her despite she was rediculed at school by her classmates. Your brother is cruel man.", "NAH - This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but I\u2019m honestly stuck in the middle and think this is one of those times where no matter what you did, you\u2019d be a little bit wrong. On the one hand, I usually believe this kind of thing should be up to the parents. It\u2019s not your place to tell her whether he\u2019s real or not. But on the other hand, she was clearly upset and asked you herself. And she was bound to find out relatively soon anyway given her age. She wanted an honest answer and you gave it to her. Lying to her in this situation feels wrong too. But I still understand your brother being upset by this.\n\nYou did what you felt was right in a situation that required an immediate response. I personally can\u2019t fault you for that. Your best course of action is probably just to apologize to your brother and encourage your niece to help keep the magic alive for her younger siblings.", "NTA poor thing she didnt figure it out before spilling the beans at school hopefully this doesn\u2019t keep her a target for bullies.\n\nYou did the right thing, she has classmates in training bras and dealing with menstrual cramps she would look absurd still believing in Santa.", "NTA. \n\nAs a parent, I understand the brother's frustration, but you DO NOT lie to children seeking a truth from you, especially at her age. She asked a straightforward question. If you had lied, she would think you were not a trustworthy person she could come to moving forward.", "NTA. I have never told my kids 27 and 30 that Santa isn\u2019t real. Why should I? That would mean I lied to them. \n\nMost people believe in a diety of some sort. Same argument that Santa exists.", "NTA. She's 11. My siblings and I figured it out at about 6. I'm surprised that nobody at school clued her in already. Can't believe anyone would think YTA. It's not a religion, it's not some sacred vow we all take.", "NTA - I found out that Santa wasn\u2019t real in 2nd grade, about 7 or 8. My mother told me that others may still believe and there will be a time when they\u2019ll figure out the truth so don\u2019t ruin it for others because it\u2019s not nice.", "NTA. 11 is actually too old to be believing in this deception. Good on you for not filling the kid with lies. If you have to be lied to in order to maintain your childhood then that childhood isn't up to much anyway. Personally I can't remember a time when I believed in Santa. I think my parents wanted me to know exactly who had given us the presents, and I see nothing wrong with that.", "NTA, but your brother is. You didn't shatter the fantasy bubble, her peer group did. She likely came to you for a reality check because she knows she can't rely on her dad to tell her the truth.\n\nIt would be reasonable to say that it's the parents' call to tell her, not yours. BUT, the fact remains that Santa and the rest are tales of childhood fantasy and are not real.\n\nIt is also a fact that parents don't control the timing as much as the peer group does.\n\nShe is 11 yo, and her schoolmates are already making fun of her. It's time for your brother to recognise that she isn't a little girl who will believe anything he tells her anymore. She's growing up, and by trying to sustain the unsustainable, he is doing her a disservice.\n\nBy the way, I was 5 when everyone at school seemed to collectively decide that anyone who still believed in Santa was still a baby.  It was obviously imported nonsense anyway - the whole Christmas fantasy is set in winter, and the snowy themes in a Southern Hemisphere summer never quite gelled, so it was pretty easy to dispel, young as we were.\n\nThat's where your niece is now: her peer group has collectively decided that the game is up.", "NTA\n\nShe asked you directly, you did what you should. And she's 11, it was high time she knew the truth.\n\nYou should have given your brother a heads up though instead of letting him find out.", "NTA when a kid asks outright I think the right think is to tell", "NTA. She's 11 years old and in middle school, she had to find out somehow. Anyone who says otherwise is not ok in the head", "NTA. My son, middle child, asked me directly one day. I still had his younger brother who believed. I took him aside and explained, as I did within older sister, thar Mommy and Daddy are Santa. He was a bit sad until I explained that, now, he and his sister can both be elves. She already knew and was my elf. She loved it. They can get up and eat the milk and cookies, help fill stockings, and put presents under the tree. \n\nTurns out, the youngest already knew. A kid at school told him. He was just playing along for the gifts. \n\nBeing Santa was the best gig. I really loved it, but there comes a time when they need to be in the know.", "NTA.\n\nKinda embarrassing for me to admit this, but I believed Santa was real until I was 12 because nobody told me the truth until I put two and two together myself. People can raise their kids how they want, but isn't age 11 a little old to believe in Santa? \n\nYou pointed out how your niece took it well, so what the hell is your brother's problem? If your niece was upset about the truth, I'd be more understanding of his reaction, but she took it well. Honestly, if I were your brother I'd be relieved that I didn't have to tell my daughter the truth myself.\n\nIn general, I think your brother overreacted. I get where hes coming from, but Nora isn't upset at all from learning the truth. You're NTA, OP.", "The truth was going to hit her at some point", "This happened with myself and my daughter. I think my daughter was in second grade. She asked snd I felt everything you described but I did tell her the truth. I didn\u2019t want her to be bullied.  I Had a TEACHER that made fun of a boy in my class for believing in Santa. It was hard to watch. Yes he was too old to believe but she was cruel.", "NTA - she wanted the truth, also I feel like 11 is a little late to believe, no? \nI knew the truth rather early on, as did my siblings. I don't understand why parents let some kids believe for so long - maybe they assume they'll realize on their own? Like my great grandparents let my grandpa believe until he was 13. That's wild to me. I feel like the cut off should be 9/10 at most.", "She's 11! She should have been told about Santa Clause 4 or 5 years earlier.", "NTA as others have said 11 is a perfectly typical age for kids to mature past the Santa myth.\n\nIt is very important she directly asked you. As soon as a kid asks anyone, fully knowing they might not like the answer they can handle it. Any answer deferring to someone else like, \"I think your dad has a good explanation so ask himi\" disrespects their willingness to seek out answers on their own.\n\nI think your brother is allowed to react as he did though, it's natural for wanting to foster childhood for as long as it can last but ultimately it's out of his control.", "NTA. She is well too old for that, and her parents are the AH for letting it go this long. At this point her belief is a social liability.", "NTA.  She\u2018s 11 not 5.  She asked you a direct question and you gave a wonderful and kind answer.  Kid\u2018s can be cruel.  I think she already knew the answer she just asked you to confirm it.  Also note that she asked you not her parents.  Sounds like she took news well.  Besides the door for questions and doubt had already been opened. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin her childhood.  Again she\u2019s 11 most kids her age already know that Santa isn\u2019t real.  I mean did he expect her to be in middle school telling her friends what Santa gave her? \n\nWould he have preferred her to be mocked and ridiculed?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't initiate the conversation. She asked you because she probably knew her parents wouldn't tell her the truth.\n\nAnd she's *eleven*. It's time she knew.", "Honestly it could go both ways, but I\u2019m leaning towards yta. It\u2019s not your place to tell someone else\u2019s kid that Santa isn\u2019t real. \n\nEven if she\u2019s a little old to not know already, that\u2019s the parent\u2019s decision and it\u2019s pretty rude to ruin that for their kid.", "No. My parents never bothered with the Santa lie either.  A poor person's experience in this world necessitates that no matter what you believe in, the season be about being kind and helpful to others who are less fortunate. The Santa lie might be a fun game for some people but we don't see it that way.", "NTA. 11/12 is usually when kids stop believing in Santa. I was. It's totally normal.", "This isn't a situation where that matters. Your brother is upset his daughter is growing up. He feels like he was robbed of one piece of that childhood magic with her. You're justified in wanting to be honest with your niece when she asks you an honest question, and you're not wrong for telling her. He'll get over it, but keep apologizing even if you don't think you should have to.\n\nWhen I was 9 I had to tell my brother, 11, that Santa wasn't real because the kids at school were making fun of him and my parents were similarly-minded naive \"let him decide for himself\" types. No kid in middle school should still believe that shit.", "NTA.\n\nShe's 11. I feel like most kids find out he's not real a few years younger than that (I'd guess about 7/8 years old, it's hard to estimate).  \nI'd say if a kid's old enough to start puberty, they're old enough to know Santa's not real.\n\nYou're niece is now at the age where kids at school are going to make fun of her for believing in Santa the older she gets, and she's also old enough to ask big girl questions.  \nShe asked you directly, and you chose a gentle truth.  \nHad you chose to lie and say he was real, she would've been in for hell in her teens when her classmates/friends found out she still believed.\n\nThe fact she wasn't upset, but your brother was gives me the vibe of either; A) him living through his kid, thus not wanting her to stop believing yet cos he never got the chance to believe, or B) him refusing to acknowledge that she's not a little girl anymore.\n\nYou didn't hurt the kid, no harm done.", "Agree with NTA. There was no possible way you could have gotten out of that convo without her knowing the truth. You did a great job of leading her into the \u201cnow you can be a part of it\u201d thing, and it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re someone she trusts if she asked you about it to begin with. Good work. She\u2019s lucky to have an aunt like you.", "NTA, she\u2019s learning it at school anyway and she asked you, her parents dropped the ball. My kids figured it out around 8-9 years old. I have a friend who believed until she was about 12 and got made fun of. She said she doesn\u2019t remember anything Santa brought her but she remembers feeling stupid when friends told her he wasn\u2019t real at 12.", "NTA \n\nHonestly I love the way you told her. Explaining she gets to become Santa now. That\u2019s probably part of what made her take it so well. \n\nI understand this is probably something her parents were excited to tell her one day, and it should usually be their job, but\u2026as other comments said, she was getting bullied for it, and told at school he isn\u2019t real, and asked you genuinely wanting to know. I honestly think it would\u2019ve been a bit mean to tell her he\u2019s real knowing that it would get her bullied more/worse when she returned. Considering her dad\u2019s reaction, im also kinda doubting he\u2019d do as good a job as you did\u2026", "NTA\n\nIn my opinion, I think the whole Santa thing is B.S., and you did the right thing by telling her the truth. It sounds like your brother is trying to keep your niece from growing up. She's 11 \u2014 almost a young adult \u2014and she shouldn't be kept under this false reality of Santa, rainbows, fairies, and a whole bunch of other garbage. It may sound harsh, but that's the world we live in. It's a shame the system doesn't teach these kids how to actually LIVE in this world but instead stuffs junk into their brains.", "NTA,\nYour brother is ridiculous. She\u2019s 11, around 9-10 kids figure it out and the last kid to know gets teased mercilessly. We had this with my youngest daughter last year. She wasn\u2019t that kid but the entire parent chat was talking about it. What did he expect you to do lie to her. Yeah dude sorry she\u2019s growing up, more than half her friends probably have boobs already\u2026 Santa is the least of his problems.", "YTA it wasn't your place. I'm so sick of this bullshit argument about Santa. If you don't want to tell your kids Santa is real, don't. But don't ruin it for everyone else.", "NTA but tip for future is to say \u2018what do you think?\u2019  My mum died when I was 18 and my sister has told her daughter that grandma lives on the moon. I have told my son something to the effect of she died, she was finished with her body so we buried it and now a tree is growing there (facts). My niece told my son grandma lives on the moon and because he\u2019s 3 he thought that was great. Whenever he tells me this or asks me I say that\u2019s what (cousin) thinks, what do you think? \nAn 11 year old is more likely to press you for an answer but you can still dodge by saying \u2018you know what I don\u2019t have kids of my own yet so I can\u2019t be sure, ask your dad\u2019.", "YTA\n\nIt was not your place to tell her that, it\u2019s up to her parents.", "YTA.\n\nThe correct answer would have been to deflect the question back to her parents.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it well and she handled it well. Your brother overreacted. Let him stew in his own juices for awhile.", "Eleven years old? NTA.", "YTA. It wasnt your place to tell her.  There were many supportive things you could have said without affirming Santa or saying he isnt real. For example, you could have said, Im sorry that made fun of you.  They were not very nice.\"", "NTA. I think you played it perfectly, and a great way to explain it. \n\nYour brother, though\u2026", "YTA Santa is so real, I just saw him at the mall.

Not your child, not your decision to make. I guarantee you that your brother and mom have planned for a couple of years now, how and when to break it or explain it if thos happened as it is bound to happen, and you have stolen that from them.\n\nSanta Clause is not a person like your niece likely imagined but it is not a lie either, it i's the spirit of a tradition that have make many children very happy, and your brother choose to give HIS daughters the opportunity of believing in giving and receiving joy thought it....  and you Grinch took it away.\n\nWhen my 12yo came like that, I explained him that Santa Clause is not a person, but a tradition and because he was grown-up now, he could participate by getting a gift to someone without signing as sent by him... so he could learn to give without expecting nothing in return. Every year, they get a gift for someone or a foundation that collects toys for Christmas and give, without hesitation, and without expecting ANYTHING in return.\n\nYou take the opportunity to explain my children specifically by telling her that their parents are lies because YOU do not understand the spirit of it, I would not let you near my children again.", "I won\u2019t call you an AH because you likely have not dealt with this and didn\u2019t know better.

I've heard many good reasons for not telling kids there is a Santa, but that isn't your call to make. If they're playing the game, coming in and spoiling it is an AH thing to do.

I don't think there was a kid in my class who still believed in him by the time I was eleven. \n\nNTA", "I can't agree with this more having been in 5th grade believing in santa I was also bullied and asked my mom and she told me. It's better to let you kid know the truth then subject them to bullying. Once you become a target of bullying it could last for years and evolve to new things and become a target for years. So it was for the best that you told them.", "nah how it works is we believe in Santa, then we don't, then when we're adults we start believing in Santa again because who else makes me lucky enough to get a bigger Christmas bonus at work than usual", "Is it sad?

We talk a lot about pretending vs real(often about shows we watch, even things like the magic school bus we talk about what stuff is real vs pretend). He has a 5 year old cousin and a nearly 4year old brother, so I although I don't lie I didn't want to tell him the \"truth\". So I told him that Santa is about the spirit of Christmas and giving to others without expecting anything in return. So it doesn't really matter how Santa works, just that Santa does work. I figure in another year or two he will realise that mama is \"Santa\" and I'll invite him to \"be Santa\" too, and help me figure out gifts for everyone. \n\nThis does remind me that I want to figure out a couple of charities for him to pick from to donate to for Christmas.", "11 is three years from high school.

It\u2019s not your place to tell someone else\u2019s kid that Santa isn\u2019t real.  \n>  \n>Even if she\u2019s a little old to not know already, that\u2019s the parent\u2019s decision and it\u2019s pretty rude to ruin that for their kid.\n\nI think, to me, what makes this firmly an NTA is that the child's classmates already told her that santa wasn't real and she was clear with her aunt that she wanted the truth. OP wasn't waving a \"Santa isn't real\" flag. The child directly asked her the question. So then it is an issue of perpetuate a story or reveal that it is a game. To me, at the age of 11, if a child is coming to you clearly wanting to know the facts about something age appropriate then you give them the facts. Even sex.", "I\u2019m with you. Redirect to her parents and let them handle it. \n\nDo I think she\u2019s old enough to learn? Absolutely but I think it\u2019s up to the parents to help her in that transition.", "It is wrong to try to maintain a charade specifically meant for children for a teenager after their peers make fun of her. What's the alternative?? Like when are you nicely allowed to tell a teenager if Santa isn't real? 15? 18?", "It\u2019s not\u2026.about the parents at that point. The kid was old enough to be bullied, come to a trusted adult, and ask a direct question. Any further lying\u2026.wouldn\u2019t be great. \n\nThere\u2019s a point when parental desires is outweighed. I\u2019d say remaining a trusted adult is more important than whatever weird impulse the brother has to keep the kid \u201chis little girl\u201d or whatever his deal is. Other kids already put the kibosh on that one. \n\nIf OP would have just walked up her and said \u201coh by the way. SANTA ISNT REAL DUMMY\u201d and walked away\u2026..AHole move.", "She's 11! If not now, when??\n\nA magic of Santa is great for children, but at some point they have to grow up!", "Would you have recommended deflecting the question? I considered this but she was so upset I thought that would make it worse. Christmas and everything surrounding it is supposed to be fun, and seeing her like that made me so uneasy. Or do you think it was  justified to directly lie to someone who trusts me to tell her the truth? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be combative, I\u2019m genuinely trying to figure out what a better way to handle this would\u2019ve been. I feel like it was a lose lose situation.", "So just let niece get relentlessly bullied by the kids at school when she comes back on Monday and says \"Santa IS real, my uncle said so\" \n\nWere you never a kid? Or were you just the bully so you didn't experience those things?", "The #1 reason for not telling your kids about Santa is that it's all made up. Why lie to your children? Pretty pathetic to get your joy out of tricking someone who doesn't know any better.", "Our reason was because of poverty. In order to participate in the Santa game, you have to be able to provide presents every year or the charade blows up in your face. My parents couldn\u2019t always do that. Many times it was Christmas presents or rent, food, heat and electricity. It\u2019s why I always went along with it with my niece. We all wanted her to have a different life than we did. And I think we were successful in that effort. Even though she knows now, Christmas is far more magical than it was in the same house 20 years ago.", "As I said to another commenter, this conclusion makes me really sad for people. Yes, he\u2019s upset about this. But we\u2019re incredibly close. Our relationship is not in jeopardy. This happened a little over a week ago and I\u2019ve already seen them twice since. He still thinks I was TA but he still loves me, and I still love both of them. Not once did he bring up the idea that I wouldn\u2019t see my niece. That would be devastating for everyone involved. Literally nothing has changed, and nothing will change. Maybe our sibling relationship is stronger than others, or maybe he doesn\u2019t care about this as much as some people, but that\u2019s an absolutely wild thought to me.", "I knew Santa wasn't real at around 6 when we would buy my mom favorite cookies to leave out for him, but I went along with it not to hurt her feelings haha!", "But it isn\u2019t pity, it\u2019s most often bullying. And you can\u2019t blame children for believing the lies their parents tell them, we all started out that trusting.", "I also work in an elementary school. Just last week a 5th grader brought up that she was excited for christmas (SpED, EL). I asked her what she wanted from Santa, and she said she wrote a letter to Santa asking for a million dollars so her parents could pay the rent.  FFS.", "BWAHAHAHA. Sorry. Fixed.", "She\u2019s very emotionally mature, and has decent reasoning abilities, which is why this never really made sense to me. Part of me wonders whether she did know, but didn\u2019t want to admit it and wanted to keep going along with it. I wouldn\u2019t doubt my brother being the type of parent that says \u201cif you don\u2019t believe in Santa, you don\u2019t get gifts,\u201d because he struggles with the idea of them growing up. I don\u2019t know that for sure, it\u2019s just speculation, but that would explain why she took it better than I thought she would, knowing that she\u2019d still get to participate in all the traditions.", "Fair point!", "I understand what you mean, but this girl wasn\u2019t a teenager she\u2019s 11. And i agree you shouldn\u2019t let your kid keep believing into their teenage years, but I still say it\u2019s not OP\u2019s place to tell her", "The bubble was already burst by the kids at school. You didn't do that - it was already done. \n\nShe wanted a reality check. It was perfectly appropriate to confirm what she already knew - even, maybe *especially*, if her father was still trying to keep her in little-child-mode.", "You didn\u2019t have to directly lie. You could have asked her what does she think? You could have told her to ask her parents. You could have answered in many ways that didn\u2019t lie but didn\u2019t directly answer her. Eleven is old to still believe but it wasn\u2019t your place. You completely over stepped your boundaries with her.", "Seems beside the point to me. It's the parents' choice. If you don't want other people jumping in to \"correct\" your parenting choices, don't do it to others.\n\nETA: I should probably admit I am biased, because I grew up in a community that did the \"let's everyone conspire to love-bomb the kids\". They do it to teach the kids about love (the religious ones do it to teach the kids some point about religious faith, I think, but in the community I grew up it everyone participated). It was beautiful. The entire world was full of goodwill. As far as it being \"made up\", it was just like a practical joke, except the point was happy memories instead of laughing at the person. So I really don't get the hostility.", "this changes nothing about you being the AH?  if anything it makes it worse as you ended a tradition your brother wanted to start for his family.", "Yes this is the only time when the \"good\" cookies were bought as they were for Santa!", "Most of us weren\u2019t gullible like this at that age. It\u2019s important to question things that don\u2019t make sense.", "I get what you mean but clearly from the prompt. The father wasn't going to tell her. And he was setting her up for failure and bullying she un knowing did her niece a huge failure. Plus if she did like her niece wouldn't feel comfortable coming to her for advice in later years", "Sorry, but you're a bit delusional or didn't interact with kids too much. From 11 to the 12 kids became teenagers. At that year my niece turned from the happy kid to the full blown moody teenager and she was already almost same height as me (I'm small but still). And to the 12 she only wore black and desperately wanted to fit in. Girls in her class started to talk about fashion and makeup. Many girls have they first menstruation at 10-12, so start their puberty. That's why adolescents starts from 10 years in modern definitions. Let someone at that age to believe in Santa is basically throwing them to wolfs.", "At 11 I was starting 7th grade (middle school here). It's tween for sure.", " She has already been told santa isn\u2019t real by kids at school, and her parents clearly can\u2019t be trusted to tell her the truth. OP seems to be one of if not the only adult in her life she can trust to be truthful. I think that relationship is important and that trust probably isn\u2019t worth sacrificing for someone else\u2019s lie.", "This wasn\u2019t meant to be a justification or to influence anyone\u2019s judgement. It was just to say that I understand both sides. The fact that I never believed doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t think anyone should. Especially because of our  past I don\u2019t think brother is wrong in any way for allowing her to believe. (I think some people only read the first paragraph of my post, and I need to emphasize that that alone wasn\u2019t what made me tell her).", "Children are supposed to be able to trust their parents implicitly. Obviously this is rarely ever the case, but no child wants to believe their parents have been lying to them their whole life. If your trust with your parents was fractured that early, I understand, but not everyone in the world is like that. You can not fault children, and potentially sheltered ones at that, for listening to their parents. It\u2019s the thing they have been trained to do their entire life.", "I am sorry, are you excusing bullying of a 11 year old child?\n\nMaybe since you are all about education you should educate your children not to bully for bullshit reasons. I can't understand how so many people just accept kids being bullied. It's like a culture at this point in some countries.", "I realized Santa didn't make sense when I was 4. I can't imagine still believing at 11.", "I\u2019m reading your message and I\u2019m not going to lie, I agree with you now 100%. I guess I was sort of projecting through my message on how i always thought kids that age shouldn\u2019t be trying to grow up so fast, if that makes so sense. But it is natural and now as I look back on it 12 years was where I too started acting like a teenager and struggling with mental health issues", "How comfortable do you think the parents will be to allow her to be around OP in the future? She completely blew up her relationship with her niece. She won\u2019t be able to be a supportive adult in her life in the future. As a parent there are certain lines you just don\u2019t cross and this is one of them. I would have told her to talk to her parents. I would have then called the parents and expressed my concerns to them. How they handled it will be up to them.", "Huh? No, who supposes this??\n\nLuckily, my parents never told me lies about Santa or religion. I always questioned and doubted their accuracy nonetheless.", "Yep, same. And some of mental health problems for me was caused by adults trying to stop time and shove me into the child again. I remember how desperately I wanted a little bit privacy, freedom and respect but my parents was struggling with my growth. That was terrible time, my mom refused to buy me a bra, because I'm a child and don't need it. Girls from the class started to tell I need one (they tried to be gently actually) and they were right, I had almost B cup. \nI can't even imagine if any kid in our class would believe in Santa... Oh god, they would be bullied so hard. It's sad, but truth.", "This is an absolutely insane conclusion. My brother and I are incredibly close. It has felt at times like all we had was each other. Yes, he wanted to her believe a little while longer, yes he\u2019s annoyed with me right now over this. (We\u2019re siblings, being annoyed with each other sometimes is just part of how it goes.) But the relationship we have, and in turn the relationship I have with my niece, is definitely not in jeopardy.", "Obviously children are supposed to be able to trust their parents. Sorry you developed trust issues so early.", "Luckily indeed. You sound like a very happy person.", "[deleted]", "But when my brother found out he absolutely lost his mind. He told me that it wasn\u2019t my place to tell her that, that I was the AH for \u201ctaking away her childhood\u201d and that I could have very easily told her to not listen to the kids at school. \n\nSo which is it? Has he absolutely lost his mind and believes you took away her childhood or is he a little annoyed?", "He did absolutely lose his mind. He was very upset when I called and told him. He yelled at me, said all the things I mentioned and eventually even hung up on me. He still thinks I\u2019m TA but eventually he cooled down. And since then he\u2019s come over to my house twice. We still talk, he\u2019s still there for me and I\u2019m still there for both of them. We\u2019re (*gasp*) still spending Christmas together and exchanging gifts. Even if we never agree about this. I guarantee not seeing my niece in the future hasn\u2019t crossed his mind. People can upset you without you cutting them out of your life completely.", "You didn\u2019t put any of that on your original post. Why did you post now when it sounds like it is already resolved?", "Well of course not, not every dispute ends that way & it\u2019s irrelevant to what would\u2019ve made me TA. The issue at hand is not resolved. We still disagree on this. I\u2019ve thought a lot about it, and I wanted to get external perspectives. Even if I was TA, that doesn\u2019t mean the relationship is ruined."]}
