My husband and I did get gifts but got non for our baby. I found that quite disresppectful. To have their grandbaby not be acknowledge even with a single gift made me quite upset and feeling excluded. I brought it up during dinner and my PIL got quiet after I stated that they should've included their grandbaby in their gifting. My husband looked at me in a \"are you serious\" way and I explained how I felt like our baby was being excluded and not so acknowledge on christmas.  Apparently, this put both my PIL on the spot. MIL picked an argument with me later on telling me dhe difn't appreciate how demanding I was and how I accused them of laying favoritism. She told me to get over myself and stop acting unreasonabld and creating drama whrn the baby isn't evrn here yet.

Giving a gift to an unborn baby for Christmas isn't something people do.\n\nIf they didn't give anything to the actual baby I'd be salty, sure. But op your demands are ridiculous, and making you sound like kind of a gold digger at least the type that tries to get whatever they can out of people. \n\nYou were in the wrong, and should apologize. YTA", "The baby is not born yet, she is four months pregnant", "Nah, they\u2019ll give presents to the baby once it\u2019s born, but whether OP gets any more presents from them remains to be seen. After this little temper tantrum, I doubt the in-laws will ever respect or have a good relationship with OP again.", "Don\u2019t forget the babies half birthday \ud83d\ude48", "Oops - you\u2019re right! I misread that as due in 4 months. Omg - not even halfway! Utterly ridiculous!", "thankyou! I totally misread", "Or like my uncle ; bring wrapped preaaenets for his own child, so she wouldnt feel left out.", "Yeah I was like, wait what?? They\u2019re definitely not going to just never get their grandchild a gift ever again because of this. That\u2019s a ridiculous assumption.", "Ugh. That\u2019s the worst."]}
