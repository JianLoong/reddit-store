He has a dog, Rex, 14 years old. \n\nRecently I was in the selection process for my dream job and I reached the last stage which would be a formal interview with one of the bosses in a city 4 hours from mine. \n\nThis job has always been my dream because it is an area that I have always loved and the selection process is one of the most difficult and lasted almost 8 months. \n\nRex was getting a little sick, he had to stay in the hospital for a few days, but the vets were hopeful, when I went to travel he would be discharged the next day. \n\nI went on Sunday night, Monday afternoon was my interview and I would be back on Tuesday morning (I don't like to take the road at night). \n\n30 minutes before the interview, my boyfriend called in tears with the news that Rex had a complication and passed away. \n\nObviously I was comforting him over the phone, trying to calm him down. After about 20 minutes, he asked if I could get on the road to be with him. I said yes, of course, I would do an interview and as soon as I got my things at the hotel, I would hit the road. He was quiet, said okay and wished me good luck. \n\nThe interview was great and the next day I was offered the position, but it lasted longer than expected (30 min and lasted 1h15). As soon as I finished, I texted and called, but no response, so I went to the hotel and took the road arriving at 7PM at his house, I went straight there.\n\n I arrived, he said that he had already buried Rex and that he didn't need my support anymore if I literally chose my career over supporting him emotionally in this loss. \n\nI tried to talk to him saying that it would have taken me at least 4 hours to help him and as soon as the interview ended, which lasted longer than I thought, I tried to talk to him. But he closed the door on my face.\n\nWe're not talking, I don't know if we're going to continue our relationship, I've brought this up to some friends of mine and some have said that in fact I made my career choice over him and his feelings are valid. \n\nI really don't think it is, because anyway I wouldn't be with him for 4 hours and I tried as soon as I could to talk to him, but I couldn't abandon the most important interview?\n\nSo, strangers, AITA?", "created_utc": 1688857026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ui2dp/aita_for_not_supporting_my_boyfriend_when_he_lost/", "score": 690, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP to lose this opportunity to arrive home 2 hrs earlier? I get that he was grieving the loss of his companion\u2026 and hopefully once the pain gets less sharp, he can realize he was being unreasonable. \n\nBut OP should probably reconsider those friendships.", "NTA-\n\n1. A selection process that takes 8 MONTHS and for what? You were already in another city when it happened and you consoled him before your interview. \n\n2. Unexpected things always happen and to miss out on your dream job would be unreasonable. If something that was hard on him happened every time you had something to attend or places to be, then you would be putting your life on hold. And then you would need to ask if it would be the same the other way around\n\n3. Wouldn\u2019t you be there for him after the interview and I\u2019m assuming after that too? If it takes him one day to grieve then yeah I guess it\u2019s important. \n\n4. He wished you good luck so he knew you were doing the interview. If it were that important he should have said that he wanted you to come immediately. \n\n4. It\u2019s a dog?? HIS dog that you don\u2019t live with.

You had two bad choices and you made the best one you could in a difficult situation. No, you didn't rush straight to your boyfriend's side when he was in need. \n\nBut actually landing your dream job has the potential to shape your life and your future immeasurably. That includes *his* future too, if you were to stay together long-term.  This isn't as straightforward as \"career vs. boyfriend\". \n\nYour job has long-term implications for you economically, in terms of your mental health, life opportunities, which experiences will be open or closed to you... and all of this has knock-on effects for the people in your life, which includes him. \n\nYou couldn't have gotten to him much faster than you did, relatively speaking. And the damage was already done - you getting there sooner wouldn't bring his dog back. And the second you were able, you rushed to his side. \n\nPragmatically, you probably did the best that you could. \n\nBut be prepared for him to continue to not see it that way.", "NTA\n\nI can only hope he's irrational due to grief and does not really believe you should have cancelled this important interview to be with him a few hours earlier. Even if it was a human relative I wouldn't necessarily expect you to cancel the interview - it really was important and it's unknown if they would give you a second chance.", "NTA- I am saying this as someone with 3 dogs who I am going to be inconsolable when they pass away. Your career comes first. You had the opportunity for a dream job and you took it. You then left earlier than expected ( while driving at a time you are not comfortable with) to be there. \n\nYour boyfriend is upset, but he shouldn\u2019t expect you to drop everything.", "NTA, your ex-bf is a controlling, self-centered AH. You were 4 hours from home, you can't teleport, and you offered to drive back that night, despite your worries about long night drives.\n\nThis isn't primarily about Rex, your BF thinks of you as an extension or accessory rather than as a full person with a life outside of his. And I'm saying this as someone with dogs I love very much. I think the problem was that you were pursuing your own thing and he absolutely could not respect that. If Rex hadn't died, you'd be a bitch for going when his dog was sick, or if Rex was fine, you'd be a villain for not thinking about how your new career might make your BF feel inadequate or lonely or whatever nonsense.\n\nLook, it sucks that Rex died, and I'm sure your bf is very sad about it, but his treatment of you is still inexcusably childish and crappy. You can do better.", "I\u2019ve lost pets and I know how gut-wrenching it is. But I can\u2019t imagine calling my SO with news like that right before their dream job interview, let alone expecting them to cancel (with a high likelihood of losing that opportunity all together) to come home  ~2 hours earlier. NTA", "NTA. \n\nAs you said, he's your _boyfriend_ (not husband), and you two don't even live together which means you are solely responsible for your own finances and wellbeing. You have to look out for yourself too. Dogs are family, so he's valid in being distraught, but he should have been very aware that you cannot risk missing out on a job opportunity and being jobless (and therefore potentially homeless).\n\nThe interview was 30m/1h, the drive was four. Whether you left immediately or not, the outcome would not have changed...It's a bit asinine for him to think you should have skipped out on a whole job opportunity that will secure your future like that...", "**Personally, I think you're NTA.**\n\nIt's clear that you cared for your boyfriend and his dog. After you had no response from him when you tried to call him, you went to his house as soon as possible, despite the fact that you don't like driving when it's too late (you arrived at 7PM).\n\nYour boyfriend said harsh comments about the way you support him, when you clearly cared for him: you tried to calm him down during the first call, changed your plans from returning a day after the interview to do it the same day instead (even having to drive that day for 4 hours more than planned!).\n\nIt's not your fault that the interview ended later than expected, and you're not the problem in this situation. I think that, despite your boyfriend having lost his dog, he could be understanding about the fact that you would take 4 hours to arrive, added to the minutes that the interview would take.\n\nYou showed your support with what you could at the moment. You didn't abandon him for your career choices, since before the interview you said that you would return as soon as the interview ended.\n\nMaybe he needs more time?", "NTA, at all. I say this as a major dog lover who has had to put down  many of my dear family members over the years. Whether a person or animal, his expectation was unfair: give up your dream job bc Rex died. Rex would still be dead regardless of when you arrived at the house. Giving up your future, something deeply affecting both of your lives is illogical.  You were ready and willing to be there to support him through his grief, he made the choice to cut ties. \n\nWhile grief makes us do wild things, and loss of a cherished family member is gutwrenching, it seems worthwhile to reflect on why you would want to continue in a relationship with someone behaving in this way when you did nothing wrong. If this is how he acts before marriage, imagine what he will do after(as that's when most bad behavers go mask off).", "I know I\u2019ll get downvoted for this. But it\u2019s a fucking dog. Do we love them? Yes. Do we think of them as family? Yes. Will I be devastated when mine does? Yes. But the death of a dog is not a reason to demand your partner trash 8 months of work and their shot as their dream job. \n\nGiven you\u2019ve been in a relationship for FIVE YEARS and still aren\u2019t living together, some part of your knows your boyfriend isn\u2019t right for you.\n\nLet Rex not be the only thing that died that day. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "NTA    This feels so wrong.   My family are pet lovers and no one would do this \n\nCalling you 20 minutes before a vitally important interview?!! Feels like sabotage, I don\u2019t care how upset he was \u2026 the call could have waited if he gave a damn about you and your career goals.   \n\nThe cold shoulder is pure petty  nonsense \n\nHe\u2019s grieving but he\u2019s also the AH.", "NTA and I\u2019ll go further. I would NEVER call someone half an hour before their interview and risk upsetting their chances and my dogs are my babies. I would wait a couple of hours and call them straight after. I would call one of my friends/family to help me cope until then.", "NTA it is completely unreasonable to expect someone to miss an important interview in this situation. \n\nEveryone reacts differently in grief but if I were in the same situation and the person I loved had endured an arduous EIGHT MONTH recruitment process and was 30 minutes away from walking into the final interview I like to think that I\u2019d hold off on the phone call until you had finished the interview and could then offer me support. Your (ex?) partner is being the selfish and self-absorbed one here. You can do the interview AND provide support. There was no need to demand you miss the interview and potentially a job offer. \n\nIs your partner jealous about the job and your success? Did they have misgivings about you taking this job if it were to be offered to you?", "Nta - it's not like it happened 24 hours before and you could reschedule the interview. You were actively about to go into the interview and you left as soon as you could.", "I lost my 11 year old dog in November to a pretty sudden onset of seizures that was diagnosed as a brain tumor. She grew up with me from 8 to 19 years old. I was an absolute sobbing mess the entire time.  Being I was your partner I wouldn't have even told you until after the interview. I don't know how you felt about the dog or your relationship with it but I know rhe people I live with were very sad. If they'd had something they worked 8 MONTHS for I would've told them when it was done. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou did not make a choice of career over him. Him and your friends are being silly. You were, rightfully so, of the impression that you could do both. Support him emotionally, and make the interview. His dog was important to him, this interview was important to you, both goals could easily have been achieved if your boyfriend was a bit more mature, and willing to empathize with you and your position. You dont want to be with someone who puts up silly ultimatums like this, that can easily be worked out in a reasonable and beneficial way for both of you, but maybe you should give him some time to get over the worst, and have and discuss it with him. Id probably wave it goodbye, but you figure it out.", "NAH    \nYou didn't NOT support him, you let him know when the interview was over that you would be on the road. You didn't have control over the length of the interview, that isn't on you.  \n  \nOnce you free from the interview and were able to get back to the hotel, you did exactly what you told him you would do.   \n  \nThink long and hard about this relationship, I get that he was in the dark place and that he needed support. At the same time, it has the feeling that he expected you to drop the interview and rush to his side.  \nIt isn't realistic to expect you to sacrifice your whole career and an important opportunity.\n  \nSounds to be that y'all have grown apart and I say to you to think back over your whole relationship and think about how many times you have made sacrifices for him versus him sacrificing for you.", "NTA.", "NTA. Ar 4 hours away, nothing would have changed.  You have the right to look after your future.  You were back to comfort him within 6 hours.  NTA", "My husband and I have been through some really horrid horrid deaths with our dogs and my parents and some family and friends on his side. We were there for each other with all of them. He would not have called me until after the interview. I may have even been mad that he didn't call me but he wouldn't have messed up my career for something I couldn't change. I might have called him, maybe. It would be hard for me to figure out the right thing to do but anyway. NTA. He is grieving and making some terrible choices and therefore I really am hesitant to call him the AH but he is wrong. You cannot miss something like that interview for something you CANNOT change or even have effect on. You wouldn't have gotten there for four hours anyway.\n\nI hope that with some time, maybe a few days he will realize he's being out of line and grieving and apologize to you. If he doesn't then he is the AH and it's time to move on.", "NTA, your dreams are important too.  It was only an extra two hours.  I have a feeling he would have been upset even if you had skipped the interview and if you had done that you would only grow to resent him.  Follow your dreams.", "INFO: Does the boyfriend work? Have his own place? Stable job history?\n\nIt's relevant here because an adult with adult financial obligations should be able to understand financial priorities.", "NTA This is a really shitty situation all around.  But for him to claim you didn't support him isn't fair, nor is it true.  Don't get me wrong I'm someone who considers my pets my family, but it wasn't reasonable for him to not consider the big picture of what would happen if you missed that interview.  He's allowed to be upset about losing his dog, but he's taking it out on you and that's not ok.", "NTA.   Even if you could leave instantly   you were 4 hours away.\n\nYou didn't cancel a nail appt, this was an interview  for your career.  And you left as soon as your could", "NTA. I know your bf is grieving over the loss of his dog, but the fact is, you told him that you will meet him after your interview. Things like this happen in life, and we do not have control over certain situations. Give your bf time, perhaps a few days or a week, and then reach out to him again. If he still doesn't want to talk this matter over like an adult, I am sorry OP, but it's time to break up. You can't put your dreams on hold because of him.", "NTA. Honestly I know your bf is grieving, but this seems like potentially a red flag. He knew how important this job was to you and how long you've been working to get it, and he would rather you spend one extra hour with him and lose the job opportunity, than wait an hour for you and give you that opportunity. It's not like there was ever the possibility that you wouldn't be there for him - the only issue was \\*when,\\* and he would barely have to wait. It's slightly concerning that he would be down to sacrifice your dreams just so that you could come comfort him immediately. People need to be able to rely on their partners emotionally, but sometimes a person needs to know how to self-soothe a bit so that their partner can rely on them as well (like you should have been able to rely on him to wait for you to finish the interview).\n\nI know people can be irrational when in pain, so maybe just try to be there for him and let him calm down a bit. If he can't see reason when he's processed the pain a bit more, he might just be a selfish person.", "I get that he is hurt but you are definitely NTA.\n\nGive him some time. My guess is his emotions will calm down and he will begin to see reason. If he can't forgive you, you can just use the door he closed in your face to move on with your life and career. That's his issue to sort out.\n\nI've lost a dog before. I've lost family before. I would never demand that anyone be there to comfort me against their own priorities, especially something so serious to you as your dream job. You made an effort and did what you said you would do, which should have been enough if he were being understanding. Hopefully he will realize that soon.", "NTA. Losing a pet is very hard. My DIL has lost to family parts in the last month and my moms elderly dad passed 2 weeks ago. You got to you as soon as you could. You leaving before your interview just doesn\u2019t make any sense. You were way to far away to change anything. He is acting out of grief. Congrats on the job.", "NTA. But, I just lost my dog a few weeks ago and was inconsolable and completely irrational for the first few days. If he comes back in the next week or so, maybe hear him out but don't let him hold it against you. You were there when you could be. Congrats on the new job!", "NTA. Your boyfriend was sad and needed support, and I imagine he decided you put yourself first because you didn't drop everything for him. However, it would be unfair of YOU to drop this for him. You could do both things and he didn't like that.\n\nIf your relationship is over or not, that's just life. It's sad but you did what was best for you, without breaking your promise of going to see him as soon as possible.\n\nYour friends, though? I'd drop them.", "Nope you put a lot of effort into the interview process I wouldn\u2019t have left either. I know people value their pets highly but there was too much at stake.", "NTA, and I'm sure he'll be more reasonable about the situation soon. He's grieving and not thinking/acting rationally.", "NTA. You hitting the road 45 minutes later wouldn't have made that much difference. Even if you had left immediately, there are many things that could have extended your travel time.  Flat tire, traffic jam, need food or a bathroom break. Congratulations on your dream job, and think seriously about whether he is the one.", "NTA.  His feelings are valid but his belief that you should give this opportunity up to rush to his side is not valid.  No matter what, you were not going to be there in time for what he wanted.", "NTA. YES, the death of a loved pet is hard but he wanted you to drop everything, including the possibility of a great job, to run home and comfort him.  You were there, just a few hours later.  \n\nHe is upset over the death, yes.  But if this attitude continues, find another man. He doesn't respect you enough to understand how important the interview was.", "NTA. You were already 4 hours away so what was an additional hour and 15 minutes? You would have been a fool to blow your future to drive all the way home. If he can\u2019t see that he\u2019s being selfish.", "NTA but I also don\u2019t think anyone is in this situation. He\u2019s hurt and grieving, it\u2019s normal for people in that position to be spiteful.", "NAH \n\nIt wasn't wrong to go to interview and you left ASAP afterward.  \n\n\nIt is natural and valid that  he feels hurt you didn't rush over, he's not thinking clearly in his grief about other people and their needs. He just feels immense loss 14 years is a long time with a pet. Losing a pet is as hard as losing a person.  \n\nHopefully once the first wave of grief subsides he can listen better.", "You are pursuing a dream.

First was our family cat who suddenly became ill. My mum made arrangements to take her to the vet but soonest time available was middle of the day on a week day. I came home to my mum upset and having to tell me Acid (I didn't name the poor thing, my sister did) had an infection in the kidneys and her kidneys were in rapid failure. It was decided at the vets office the kindest thing to do was to let her go and save her further suffering. Was I upset? Hell yes. But not at mum or the vet. I was old enough to understand. At least got to bury her at home.\n\nSecond was our dog Brodie. She'd had a defect with her upper palette her whole life and she was about 12 when it really started horribly affecting her daily life causing breathing and swallowing issues. Vet concluded nothing could be done since very strong danger going under anesthesia would kill her and no guarantee surgery wouldn't make things worse like the other times we'd touched on it through her life. After an extremely bad choking fit my mum and brother rushed her to the emergency vet and it was decided it was time. Once again I was very upset, but understood. She was also buried in our home.\n\n3rd was our last family dog Sarah Jane. She had a birth defect with an enlarged and malformed liver and wasn't meant to live past 5-6 years. She made it to 15. Mum and dad called me the day she showed signs she was done and wanted to move on, the vet confirming her liver was failing finally, but she was in no pain so mum and dad took her home and tucked her into her bed. She passed a few hours later and they called me immediately. This time I was 6hrs away living other end of the state and even if I had started driving after the first call I would have never made it.\n\nAt least with my husband and I got to be there for our cat Meg. She was 18 1/2 (adopted at 11yo and with us 7 year) and passed quietly and comfortably yesterday after a very rapid decline from what vet suspected was a rather aggressive form of bowel cancer that doesn't have obvious lumps or tumors and is spread through the bowel by the time symptoms show. Which explained why we never felt anything cause she LOVED belly rubs by having her belly rubbed and squished so we could have felt any lumps or changes. Her advanced age plus heart murmur meant even mild anesthesia to scan and confirm it wasn't recommended and vet was frank they wouldn't even offer chemo as it was kinda pointless and unnecessary additional stress and discomfort for likely no good out come.
