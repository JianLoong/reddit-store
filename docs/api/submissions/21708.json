He has a dog, Rex, 14 years old. \n\nRecently I was in the selection process for my dream job and I reached the last stage which would be a formal interview with one of the bosses in a city 4 hours from mine. \n\nThis job has always been my dream because it is an area that I have always loved and the selection process is one of the most difficult and lasted almost 8 months. \n\nRex was getting a little sick, he had to stay in the hospital for a few days, but the vets were hopeful, when I went to travel he would be discharged the next day. \n\nI went on Sunday night, Monday afternoon was my interview and I would be back on Tuesday morning (I don't like to take the road at night). \n\n30 minutes before the interview, my boyfriend called in tears with the news that Rex had a complication and passed away. \n\nObviously I was comforting him over the phone, trying to calm him down. After about 20 minutes, he asked if I could get on the road to be with him. I said yes, of course, I would do an interview and as soon as I got my things at the hotel, I would hit the road. He was quiet, said okay and wished me good luck. \n\nThe interview was great and the next day I was offered the position, but it lasted longer than expected (30 min and lasted 1h15). As soon as I finished, I texted and called, but no response, so I went to the hotel and took the road arriving at 7PM at his house, I went straight there.\n\n I arrived, he said that he had already buried Rex and that he didn't need my support anymore if I literally chose my career over supporting him emotionally in this loss. \n\nI tried to talk to him saying that it would have taken me at least 4 hours to help him and as soon as the interview ended, which lasted longer than I thought, I tried to talk to him. But he closed the door on my face.\n\nWe're not talking, I don't know if we're going to continue our relationship, I've brought this up to some friends of mine and some have said that in fact I made my career choice over him and his feelings are valid. \n\nI really don't think it is, because anyway I wouldn't be with him for 4 hours and I tried as soon as I could to talk to him, but I couldn't abandon the most important interview?\n\nSo, strangers, AITA?", "created_utc": 1688857026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ui2dp/aita_for_not_supporting_my_boyfriend_when_he_lost/", "score": 233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP to lose this opportunity to arrive home 2 hrs earlier? I get that he was grieving the loss of his companion\u2026 and hopefully once the pain gets less sharp, he can realize he was being unreasonable. \n\nBut OP should probably reconsider those friendships.", "NTA-\n\n1. A selection process that takes 8 MONTHS and for what? You were already in another city when it happened and you consoled him before your interview. \n\n2. Unexpected things always happen and to miss out on your dream job would be unreasonable. If something that was hard on him happened every time you had something to attend or places to be, then you would be putting your life on hold. And then you would need to ask if it would be the same the other way around\n\n3. Wouldn\u2019t you be there for him after the interview and I\u2019m assuming after that too? If it takes him one day to grieve then yeah I guess it\u2019s important. \n\n4. He wished you good luck so he knew you were doing the interview. If it were that important he should have said that he wanted you to come immediately. \n\n4. It\u2019s a dog?? HIS dog that you don\u2019t live with. There\u2019s only so much you can do.", "NTA\n\nYou clearly care about him and did everything you could to be there for him.", "NTA. \n\nLook. This fucking sucks. You had two bad choices and you made the best one you could in a difficult situation. No, you didn't rush straight to your boyfriend's side when he was in need. \n\nBut actually landing your dream job has the potential to shape your life and your future immeasurably. That includes *his* future too, if you were to stay together long-term.  This isn't as straightforward as \"career vs. boyfriend\". \n\nYour job has long-term implications for you economically, in terms of your mental health, life opportunities, which experiences will be open or closed to you... and all of this has knock-on effects for the people in your life, which includes him. \n\nYou couldn't have gotten to him much faster than you did, relatively speaking. And the damage was already done - you getting there sooner wouldn't bring his dog back. And the second you were able, you rushed to his side. \n\nPragmatically, you probably did the best that you could. \n\nBut be prepared for him to continue to not see it that way.", "NTA\n\nI can only hope he's irrational due to grief and does not really believe you should have cancelled this important interview to be with him a few hours earlier. Even if it was a human relative I wouldn't necessarily expect you to cancel the interview - it really was important and it's unknown if they would give you a second chance.", "NTA- I am saying this as someone with 3 dogs who I am going to be inconsolable when they pass away. Your career comes first. You had the opportunity for a dream job and you took it. You then left earlier than expected ( while driving at a time you are not comfortable with) to be there. \n\nYour boyfriend is upset, but he shouldn\u2019t expect you to drop everything.", "NTA, your ex-bf is a controlling, self-centered AH. You were 4 hours from home, you can't teleport, and you offered to drive back that night, despite your worries about long night drives.\n\nThis isn't primarily about Rex, your BF thinks of you as an extension or accessory rather than as a full person with a life outside of his. And I'm saying this as someone with dogs I love very much. I think the problem was that you were pursuing your own thing and he absolutely could not respect that. If Rex hadn't died, you'd be a bitch for going when his dog was sick, or if Rex was fine, you'd be a villain for not thinking about how your new career might make your BF feel inadequate or lonely or whatever nonsense.\n\nLook, it sucks that Rex died, and I'm sure your bf is very sad about it, but his treatment of you is still inexcusably childish and crappy. You can do better.", "I\u2019ve lost pets and I know how gut-wrenching it is. But I can\u2019t imagine calling my SO with news like that right before their dream job interview, let alone expecting them to cancel (with a high likelihood of losing that opportunity all together) to come home  ~2 hours earlier. NTA", "NTA. \n\nAs you said, he's your _boyfriend_ (not husband), and you two don't even live together which means you are solely responsible for your own finances and wellbeing. You have to look out for yourself too. Dogs are family, so he's valid in being distraught, but he should have been very aware that you cannot risk missing out on a job opportunity and being jobless (and therefore potentially homeless).\n\nThe interview was 30m/1h, the drive was four. Whether you left immediately or not, the outcome would not have changed...It's a bit asinine for him to think you should have skipped out on a whole job opportunity that will secure your future like that...", "**Personally, I think you're NTA.**\n\nIt's clear that you cared for your boyfriend and his dog. After you had no response from him when you tried to call him, you went to his house as soon as possible, despite the fact that you don't like driving when it's too late (you arrived at 7PM).\n\nYour boyfriend said harsh comments about the way you support him, when you clearly cared for him: you tried to calm him down during the first call, changed your plans from returning a day after the interview to do it the same day instead (even having to drive that day for 4 hours more than planned!).\n\nIt's not your fault that the interview ended later than expected, and you're not the problem in this situation. I think that, despite your boyfriend having lost his dog, he could be understanding about the fact that you would take 4 hours to arrive, added to the minutes that the interview would take.\n\nYou showed your support with what you could at the moment. You didn't abandon him for your career choices, since before the interview you said that you would return as soon as the interview ended.\n\nMaybe he needs more time?", "NTA, at all. I say this as a major dog lover who has had to put down  many of my dear family members over the years. Whether a person or animal, his expectation was unfair: give up your dream job bc Rex died. Rex would still be dead regardless of when you arrived at the house. Giving up your future, something deeply affecting both of your lives is illogical.  You were ready and willing to be there to support him through his grief, he made the choice to cut ties. \n\nWhile grief makes us do wild things, and loss of a cherished family member is gutwrenching, it seems worthwhile to reflect on why you would want to continue in a relationship with someone behaving in this way when you did nothing wrong. If this is how he acts before marriage, imagine what he will do after(as that's when most bad behavers go mask off).", "I know I\u2019ll get downvoted for this. But it\u2019s a fucking dog. Do we love them? Yes. Do we think of them as family? Yes. Will I be devastated when mine does? Yes. But the death of a dog is not a reason to demand your partner trash 8 months of work and their shot as their dream job. \n\nGiven you\u2019ve been in a relationship for FIVE YEARS and still aren\u2019t living together, some part of your knows your boyfriend isn\u2019t right for you.\n\nLet Rex not be the only thing that died that day. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "NTA    This feels so wrong.   My family are pet lovers and no one would do this \n\nCalling you 20 minutes before a vitally important interview?!! Feels like sabotage, I don\u2019t care how upset he was \u2026 the call could have waited if he gave a damn about you and your career goals.   \n\nThe cold shoulder is pure petty  nonsense \n\nHe\u2019s grieving but he\u2019s also the AH.", "NTA and I\u2019ll go further. I would NEVER call someone half an hour before their interview and risk upsetting their chances and my dogs are my babies. I would wait a couple of hours and call them straight after. I would call one of my friends/family to help me cope until then.", "NTA it is completely unreasonable to expect someone to miss an important interview in this situation. \n\nEveryone reacts differently in grief but if I were in the same situation and the person I loved had endured an arduous EIGHT MONTH recruitment process and was 30 minutes away from walking into the final interview I like to think that I\u2019d hold off on the phone call until you had finished the interview and could then offer me support. Your (ex?) partner is being the selfish and self-absorbed one here. You can do the interview AND provide support. There was no need to demand you miss the interview and potentially a job offer. \n\nIs your partner jealous about the job and your success? Did they have misgivings about you taking this job if it were to be offered to you?", "Nta - it's not like it happened 24 hours before and you could reschedule the interview. You were actively about to go into the interview and you left as soon as you could.", "I lost my 11 year old dog in November to a pretty sudden onset of seizures that was diagnosed as a brain tumor. She grew up with me from 8 to 19 years old. I was an absolute sobbing mess the entire time.  Being I was your partner I wouldn't have even told you until after the interview. I don't know how you felt about the dog or your relationship with it but I know rhe people I live with were very sad. If they'd had something they worked 8 MONTHS for I would've told them when it was done. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou did not make a choice of career over him. Him and your friends are being silly. You were, rightfully so, of the impression that you could do both. Support him emotionally, and make the interview. His dog was important to him, this interview was important to you, both goals could easily have been achieved if your boyfriend was a bit more mature, and willing to empathize with you and your position. You dont want to be with someone who puts up silly ultimatums like this, that can easily be worked out in a reasonable and beneficial way for both of you, but maybe you should give him some time to get over the worst, and have and discuss it with him. Id probably wave it goodbye, but you figure it out.", "NAH    \nYou didn't NOT support him, you let him know when the interview was over that you would be on the road. You didn't have control over the length of the interview, that isn't on you.  \n  \nOnce you free from the interview and were able to get back to the hotel, you did exactly what you told him you would do.   \n  \nThink long and hard about this relationship, I get that he was in the dark place and that he needed support. At the same time, it has the feeling that he expected you to drop the interview and rush to his side.  \nIt isn't realistic to expect you to sacrifice your whole career and an important opportunity.\n  \nSounds to be that y'all have grown apart and I say to you to think back over your whole relationship and think about how many times you have made sacrifices for him versus him sacrificing for you.", "NTA.", "NTA. Ar 4 hours away, nothing would have changed.  You have the right to look after your future.  You were back to comfort him within 6 hours.  NTA", "My husband and I have been through some really horrid horrid deaths with our dogs and my parents and some family and friends on his side. We were there for each other with all of them. He would not have called me until after the interview. I may have even been mad that he didn't call me but he wouldn't have messed up my career for something I couldn't change. I might have called him, maybe. It would be hard for me to figure out the right thing to do but anyway. NTA. He is grieving and making some terrible choices and therefore I really am hesitant to call him the AH but he is wrong. You cannot miss something like that interview for something you CANNOT change or even have effect on. You wouldn't have gotten there for four hours anyway.\n\nI hope that with some time, maybe a few days he will realize he's being out of line and grieving and apologize to you. If he doesn't then he is the AH and it's time to move on.", "NTA, your dreams are important too.  It was only an extra two hours.  I have a feeling he would have been upset even if you had skipped the interview and if you had done that you would only grow to resent him.  Follow your dreams.", "INFO: Does the boyfriend work? Have his own place? Stable job history?\n\nIt's relevant here because an adult with adult financial obligations should be able to understand financial priorities.", "NTA This is a really shitty situation all around.  But for him to claim you didn't support him isn't fair, nor is it true.  Don't get me wrong I'm someone who considers my pets my family, but it wasn't reasonable for him to not consider the big picture of what would happen if you missed that interview.  He's allowed to be upset about losing his dog, but he's taking it out on you and that's not ok.", "NTA.   Even if you could leave instantly   you were 4 hours away.\n\nYou didn't cancel a nail appt, this was an interview  for your career.  And you left as soon as your could", "NTA. I know your bf is grieving over the loss of his dog, but the fact is, you told him that you will meet him after your interview. Things like this happen in life, and we do not have control over certain situations. Give your bf time, perhaps a few days or a week, and then reach out to him again. If he still doesn't want to talk this matter over like an adult, I am sorry OP, but it's time to break up. You can't put your dreams on hold because of him.", "NTA. Honestly I know your bf is grieving, but this seems like potentially a red flag. He knew how important this job was to you and how long you've been working to get it, and he would rather you spend one extra hour with him and lose the job opportunity, than wait an hour for you and give you that opportunity. It's not like there was ever the possibility that you wouldn't be there for him - the only issue was \\*when,\\* and he would barely have to wait. It's slightly concerning that he would be down to sacrifice your dreams just so that you could come comfort him immediately. People need to be able to rely on their partners emotionally, but sometimes a person needs to know how to self-soothe a bit so that their partner can rely on them as well (like you should have been able to rely on him to wait for you to finish the interview).\n\nI know people can be irrational when in pain, so maybe just try to be there for him and let him calm down a bit. If he can't see reason when he's processed the pain a bit more, he might just be a selfish person.", "I get that he is hurt but you are definitely NTA.\n\nGive him some time. My guess is his emotions will calm down and he will begin to see reason. If he can't forgive you, you can just use the door he closed in your face to move on with your life and career. That's his issue to sort out.\n\nI've lost a dog before. I've lost family before. I would never demand that anyone be there to comfort me against their own priorities, especially something so serious to you as your dream job. You made an effort and did what you said you would do, which should have been enough if he were being understanding. Hopefully he will realize that soon.", "NTA. Losing a pet is very hard. My DIL has lost to family parts in the last month and my moms elderly dad passed 2 weeks ago. You got to you as soon as you could. You leaving before your interview just doesn\u2019t make any sense. You were way to far away to change anything. He is acting out of grief. Congrats on the job.", "NTA. But, I just lost my dog a few weeks ago and was inconsolable and completely irrational for the first few days. If he comes back in the next week or so, maybe hear him out but don't let him hold it against you. You were there when you could be. Congrats on the new job!", "NTA. Your boyfriend was sad and needed support, and I imagine he decided you put yourself first because you didn't drop everything for him. However, it would be unfair of YOU to drop this for him. You could do both things and he didn't like that.\n\nIf your relationship is over or not, that's just life. It's sad but you did what was best for you, without breaking your promise of going to see him as soon as possible.\n\nYour friends, though? I'd drop them.", "Nope you put a lot of effort into the interview process I wouldn\u2019t have left either. I know people value their pets highly but there was too much at stake.", "NTA, and I'm sure he'll be more reasonable about the situation soon. He's grieving and not thinking/acting rationally.", "NTA. You hitting the road 45 minutes later wouldn't have made that much difference. Even if you had left immediately, there are many things that could have extended your travel time.  Flat tire, traffic jam, need food or a bathroom break. Congratulations on your dream job, and think seriously about whether he is the one.", "NTA.  His feelings are valid but his belief that you should give this opportunity up to rush to his side is not valid.  No matter what, you were not going to be there in time for what he wanted.", "NTA. YES, the death of a loved pet is hard but he wanted you to drop everything, including the possibility of a great job, to run home and comfort him.  You were there, just a few hours later.  \n\nHe is upset over the death, yes.  But if this attitude continues, find another man. He doesn't respect you enough to understand how important the interview was.", "NTA. You were already 4 hours away so what was an additional hour and 15 minutes? You would have been a fool to blow your future to drive all the way home. If he can\u2019t see that he\u2019s being selfish.", "NTA but I also don\u2019t think anyone is in this situation. He\u2019s hurt and grieving, it\u2019s normal for people in that position to be spiteful.", "NAH \n\nIt wasn't wrong to go to interview and you left ASAP afterward.  \n\n\nIt is natural and valid that  he feels hurt you didn't rush over, he's not thinking clearly in his grief about other people and their needs. He just feels immense loss 14 years is a long time with a pet. Losing a pet is as hard as losing a person.  \n\nHopefully once the first wave of grief subsides he can listen better.", "You are pursuing a dream.

I get he's distraught, and you eating a fight about not being there when he's a wreck may be reasonable, but he has no leg to stand on. You're both adults, and you did the adult thing. You're allowed to use foresight and make decisions that will ultimately make your life better. His dog dying is tragic, but his dog had already died regardless if you were home or not. Don't beat yourself up over this.", "I love my pets like they are my kids (now that my kids are grown). \n\nBut there's no way I would expect someone to sacrifice a job interview for me over a deceased pet. As a matter of fact, my vet held on to the body of one of my dogs until I could find a place to bury her. At the time, I couldn't afford cremation, and I lived in an apartment. (I had spent all my money on her medical care. She was old.) \n\nYour boyfriend is being unreasonable and childish. \n\nYes, it sucks to dig that hole and fill it back up. \n\nInterviews so go on longer than planned, particularly if they are going well. There's no reason he couldn't have waited for you for a couple hours. \n\nSkipping a job interview or cutting it short isn't supporting him. It's self sabotage. And it's unreasonable to expect that. \n\nGive him a few days to come to his senses, and if he doesn't, you are better off without him.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend had a big loss, but this was also clearly a huge interview.  You did what you needed to do, then came to help as fast as you could.  Nobody reasonable would expect you to do anything other than what you did.  Your boyfriend sounds pretty self-centered, and I'm wondering if you aren't better off not talking to him.  He's got a bad case of main character syndrome.", "I love animals much more than people. I think a dog passing is harder than a family member. But, I don't think you're the asshole here. You did what you could to support him. He's acting selfish, you were out of town and Rex had passed.", "Your boyfriend loved Rex and it's heartbreaking. He'll learn to deal with his loss of Rex and eventually feel better. And you will learn to deal with the end of this relationship and may even look back and think it wasn't that great of a loss for you. You were not there to support him when he lost his beloved Rex, and likewise, he was not there to support you when you needed it during an important life event. You're two trains running on different tracks. Neither of you are the AH. Okay, he is to some degree.", "NTA -- this is the epitome of stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nbut to put it bluntly, you were ALREADY 4 hours away. it was going to take you 4 hours to get back home either way. \nto top it off, you had been going through the selection process for several months.", "If the situation was reversed would you take it well? Not worth ruining a relationship over him being upset over losing a 14yr old mate. Everyone grieves differently and time heals all. Congrats on the job!!!", "NTA. Your career is important and you don't want to jeopardize your chance in getting your dream job. You were supportive of your boyfriend in the loss of his dog. Your boyfriend overreacted and he should apologize to you for his behavior.", "NTA we (hubby and I) put my first Chihuahua down yesterday.  We had to put down 2 adopted Chi dogs (one old age, one the disease he had when we adopted him took him down). Each time I have been grateful my husband could leave work to attend.  It sucked being the one to decide end of life or go for broke/ just maybe life and quality of life extensions. But he defers to my knowledge as did/do the vets.  \n\n\nI'm lucky.  Both in my husband could attend and I could as well.  \n\n\nYour boyfriend is in pain (as I am) but you are NTA and it may take him a bit to realize this.  \n\n\nPets passing sucks.", "NTA it's a sad situation but there was nothing those 45 minutes really could have changed", "NTA. Yes, you chose your career over an extra 2hrs of comforting him. You could still comfort him, but he's angry that you didn't drop everything for him immediately, proving that his feelings matter more than yours, more than your dreams, more than all the effort you spent to get here. \n\nFrankly, if this is really weird of him, it might be he's in the anger part of grief. Not an excuse. But, he may come around and apologize for expecting you to not do the interview. \n\nBut, if he doesn't and/or this is just the latest thing in putting himself first or expecting you to bend to what he wants, that's not a good partner, not someone who wants the best for you, wants you to be happy.", "I mean....traffic could've made you that late. \n\nProbably should've just told him you were on your way. \n\nNta", "NTA at all, and I know he\u2019s grieving but I think he\u2019s being extremely unreasonable and selfish here. And there\u2019s something wrong with your friends who agree with him. It\u2019s your *dream* job, the process took 8 months, and he expected you to walk away from it so you could comfort him? When you were already 4 hours away and he\u2019d have to wait anyway? Grieving or not, this is a pretty big red flag.", "NTA- You told him you were gonna head back AFTER your interview and he buried the dog before you even got home. He did it on purpose to make you the bad guy. And congratulations on your new dream job!!", "Not the asshole, at all.", "NTA, it was a delay of roughly an hour, you rushed right there to be with him. I understand that losing a pet is hard but it sounds like he\u2019s misplacing his anger over the loss here. \n\nCongrats on the job!", "NTA. Your boyfriend is being impractical and selfish.", "What a good time to break free from a controlling, emotionally manipulative boyfriend\u2026. New career and a new life are in your future!  Seriously tho, NTA", "NTA\n\nExpecting a partner to sabotage their career and future over not being able to wait an additional two hours in a non-emergency situation is fucked up.\n\nYour boyfriend never should have expected you to give up this interview.", "NTA. It sucks he lost his dog, but you had a once in a life time opportunity happening at the same time. You did what was best for you in that moment. If he doesnt understand that then im sorry, but maybe you all are not meant to be", "Assuming this was a career type job, absolutely and in no way are you at fault. NTA \n\nSometimes I go to r/antiwork and if it was one of those jobs where people and jobs are disposable and replaceable then maybe you could have handled it differently. I\u2019m wondering if those are the kinds of jobs your boyfriend is used to, and if he just doesn\u2019t realize that many jobs are better than that, and that it\u2019s not feasible for people who want good jobs to blow off interviews.", "This job interview seems like a once in a life time opportunity. The fact that he was expecting you to drop everything for him is so selfish. NTA. Maybe reconsider your relationship and friendships.", "nta lol", "Seriously about the friendships. I'm going to guess that OP is the most successful of her friends.", "I recently had to put my extremely old dog down. He went downhill super fast (from cranky but active and happy old man to gone in a week).\n\nI took him to the emergency vet and was told there was no hope and he was in pain and it was time to say goodbye.\n\nMy daughter was at work (we got him as a puppy when she was 12 so it was really her dog). The vet said he would last till evening, maybe, but he would be in extreme pain. My daughter and I texted for a minute but she could not leave work. So we decided, for the dog's sake, we would not wait till she could be there.\n\nWas I sad she wasn't there? Of course. Was she absolutely devastated she wasn't there? Hell yes. But that's how life works sometimes. NTA.", "I think #2 cut off but I agree with your points completely.", "Lowkey feels like sabotage", "I generally agree with you, except that I don't think she had two bad choices; I think she had one bad choice, and one sensible one \u2013 and she picked the sensible one.\n\nLook, I'm a huge dog person. It absolutely wrecks me when I have to let one go \u2013 and I've done it twice recently \u2013 but I would never, ever expect someone to skip out on a job interview at the last second to hold my hand through it, *especially* when the interview isn't even in town and leaving right then would still mean she was hours away. OP's bf is being a ridiculous, whiny, self-centered AH, and he needs to grow the hell up.", "good point. selfish of him to burden her with this before the interview.\n\nHe needs to grow up.", "To be honest, I've lost a parent and it was the most devastating thing in my life, but if my partner was 4 hours away from me, I wouldn't expect him to magically arrive back. Unless it was a choice between being there in 5 minutes or a day later, I would say to them to wait. Having someone with you is comforting yes, but it isn't going to change the situation. NTA", "Yes, the dog was 14, so the death was not unexpected.\n\nDogs don't live as long as people. If you can't cope with the loss of a dog or cat, maybe pet ownership is not for you. \n\nAnd I love my dog as much as anyone. He sleeps in the bed with me and my husband.", "He wasn't \"a bit disappointed\" though. He was passive-aggressive, refused to talk to OP, and unfairly claimed she had let him down/didn't care even though she did haul ass to get there as soon as she could.\n\nHe wasn't okay unless she gave up something really important to her, which she'd spent 8 months on, just to be with him (checks notes) 4 hours instead of 6 hours after he notified her his dog died. \n\nThat's all flavour of controlling.", "you forgot the part about her boyfriend being completely self-absorbed and totally disregarding what was important to her, for the mere benefit of her arriving two hours earlier. He is an asshole for demanding that she gives up the interview for her dream job, just so she could arrive 2 hours earlier to console him. It's an absolutely pointless exercise, with real life consequences for her. Maybe you can give him some benefit of the doubt, considering his emotional state, but if he does not come around to see her side of the story its no doubt in my mind she should leave him. It's non-negotiable, you need to be able to find reasonable compromises to be in a relationship with someone. Her boyfriend was 100% unreasonable, and are also unresponsive and unwilling to discuss it.\n\nEdit: and the fact that she never said she was considering leaving him, even though she totally should start thinking about it. Nobody should be in a relationship with someone who is this unreasonable and unwilling to see the other persons perspective.", "Listen my dog is my life. I sometimes cry just thinking about losing him. But I wouldn't even expect my WIFE to give up something like that. She'd be broken up because my dog is hers as well but these two don't even live together and the dog was 14. That's pretty damn good, Mines only expected to give me 9 years. \n\nNot to sound too harsh here but OP was already 4 hours away and the dog was already dead. Did he expect OP to wave a magic wand and poof 4 hours to him? He wasn't willing to wait an extra hour to bury the dog? Says way more about him than her.", "Most of these Reddit posts on AITA are full of absolutely awful friends.", "Fixed it. Thank you", "Nothing low key about it. BF used the dog to emotionally blackmail her into ruining her chance at bettering herself and moving on.", "Agreed on the sensible option. I feel for the BF, losing a pet is always hard, but sometimes life just gets in the way. When I lost my last dog I had to put him to sleep at 7am in the morning and I was heartbroken, but I'm an accountant and it was month end deadline, it wasn't an option for me to take any time off. The world doesn't stop turning, and OP's career is what's going to pay the bills for a big chunk of her life. There was only one call she could make.", "Yeah, my dog is 16 now, and I know her time is coming to an end. I'll still be devastated when she passes, but it's not like it'll be completely unexpected. For the majority of dogs, anything you get past 13 years is a blessing", "Exactly. It would have made absolutely no sense for OP to jettison her chance at a great job she really wanted just because her bf didn't want to wait 2 more hours for her to get home. Hell, I wouldn't have expected that when my *father* died, and losing him was absolutely the most horrible experience of my life."]}
