He has a dog, Rex, 14 years old. \n\nRecently I was in the selection process for my dream job and I reached the last stage which would be a formal interview with one of the bosses in a city 4 hours from mine. \n\nThis job has always been my dream because it is an area that I have always loved and the selection process is one of the most difficult and lasted almost 8 months. \n\nRex was getting a little sick, he had to stay in the hospital for a few days, but the vets were hopeful, when I went to travel he would be discharged the next day. \n\nI went on Sunday night, Monday afternoon was my interview and I would be back on Tuesday morning (I don't like to take the road at night). \n\n30 minutes before the interview, my boyfriend called in tears with the news that Rex had a complication and passed away. \n\nObviously I was comforting him over the phone, trying to calm him down. After about 20 minutes, he asked if I could get on the road to be with him. I said yes, of course, I would do an interview and as soon as I got my things at the hotel, I would hit the road. He was quiet, said okay and wished me good luck. \n\nThe interview was great and the next day I was offered the position, but it lasted longer than expected (30 min and lasted 1h15). As soon as I finished, I texted and called, but no response, so I went to the hotel and took the road arriving at 7PM at his house, I went straight there.\n\n I arrived, he said that he had already buried Rex and that he didn't need my support anymore if I literally chose my career over supporting him emotionally in this loss. \n\nI tried to talk to him saying that it would have taken me at least 4 hours to help him and as soon as the interview ended, which lasted longer than I thought, I tried to talk to him. But he closed the door on my face.\n\nWe're not talking, I don't know if we're going to continue our relationship, I've brought this up to some friends of mine and some have said that in fact I made my career choice over him and his feelings are valid. \n\nI really don't think it is, because anyway I wouldn't be with him for 4 hours and I tried as soon as I could to talk to him, but I couldn't abandon the most important interview?\n\nSo, strangers, AITA?", "created_utc": 1688857026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ui2dp/aita_for_not_supporting_my_boyfriend_when_he_lost/", "score": 1101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP to lose this opportunity to arrive home 2 hrs earlier? I get that he was grieving the loss of his companion\u2026 and hopefully once the pain gets less sharp, he can realize he was being unreasonable. \n\nBut OP should probably reconsider those friendships.", "NTA-\n\n1. A selection process that takes 8 MONTHS and for what? You were already in another city when it happened and you consoled him before your interview. \n\n2. Unexpected things always happen and to miss out on your dream job would be unreasonable. If something that was hard on him happened every time you had something to attend or places to be, then you would be putting your life on hold. And then you would need to ask if it would be the same the other way around\n\n3. Wouldn\u2019t you be there for him after the interview and I\u2019m assuming after that too? If it takes him one day to grieve then yeah I guess it\u2019s important. \n\n4. He wished you good luck so he knew you were doing the interview. If it were that important he should have said that he wanted you to come immediately. \n\n4. It\u2019s a dog?? HIS dog that you don\u2019t live with. There\u2019s only so much you can do.", "NTA\n\nYou clearly care about him and did everything you could to be there for him.", "NTA. \n\nLook. This fucking sucks. You had two bad choices and you made the best one you could in a difficult situation. No, you didn't rush straight to your boyfriend's side when he was in need. \n\nBut actually landing your dream job has the potential to shape your life and your future immeasurably. That includes *his* future too, if you were to stay together long-term.  This isn't as straightforward as \"career vs. boyfriend\". \n\nYour job has long-term implications for you economically, in terms of your mental health, life opportunities, which experiences will be open or closed to you... and all of this has knock-on effects for the people in your life, which includes him. \n\nYou couldn't have gotten to him much faster than you did, relatively speaking. And the damage was already done - you getting there sooner wouldn't bring his dog back. And the second you were able, you rushed to his side. \n\nPragmatically, you probably did the best that you could. \n\nBut be prepared for him to continue to not see it that way.", "NTA\n\nI can only hope he's irrational due to grief and does not really believe you should have cancelled this important interview to be with him a few hours earlier. Even if it was a human relative I wouldn't necessarily expect you to cancel the interview - it really was important and it's unknown if they would give you a second chance.", "NTA- I am saying this as someone with 3 dogs who I am going to be inconsolable when they pass away. Your career comes first. You had the opportunity for a dream job and you took it. You then left earlier than expected ( while driving at a time you are not comfortable with) to be there. \n\nYour boyfriend is upset, but he shouldn\u2019t expect you to drop everything.", "NTA, your ex-bf is a controlling, self-centered AH. You were 4 hours from home, you can't teleport, and you offered to drive back that night, despite your worries about long night drives.\n\nThis isn't primarily about Rex, your BF thinks of you as an extension or accessory rather than as a full person with a life outside of his. And I'm saying this as someone with dogs I love very much. I think the problem was that you were pursuing your own thing and he absolutely could not respect that. If Rex hadn't died, you'd be a bitch for going when his dog was sick, or if Rex was fine, you'd be a villain for not thinking about how your new career might make your BF feel inadequate or lonely or whatever nonsense.\n\nLook, it sucks that Rex died, and I'm sure your bf is very sad about it, but his treatment of you is still inexcusably childish and crappy. You can do better.", "I\u2019ve lost pets and I know how gut-wrenching it is. But I can\u2019t imagine calling my SO with news like that right before their dream job interview, let alone expecting them to cancel (with a high likelihood of losing that opportunity all together) to come home  ~2 hours earlier. NTA", "NTA. \n\nAs you said, he's your _boyfriend_ (not husband), and you two don't even live together which means you are solely responsible for your own finances and wellbeing. You have to look out for yourself too. Dogs are family, so he's valid in being distraught, but he should have been very aware that you cannot risk missing out on a job opportunity and being jobless (and therefore potentially homeless).\n\nThe interview was 30m/1h, the drive was four. Whether you left immediately or not, the outcome would not have changed...It's a bit asinine for him to think you should have skipped out on a whole job opportunity that will secure your future like that...", "**Personally, I think you're NTA.**\n\nIt's clear that you cared for your boyfriend and his dog. After you had no response from him when you tried to call him, you went to his house as soon as possible, despite the fact that you don't like driving when it's too late (you arrived at 7PM).\n\nYour boyfriend said harsh comments about the way you support him, when you clearly cared for him: you tried to calm him down during the first call, changed your plans from returning a day after the interview to do it the same day instead (even having to drive that day for 4 hours more than planned!).\n\nIt's not your fault that the interview ended later than expected, and you're not the problem in this situation. I think that, despite your boyfriend having lost his dog, he could be understanding about the fact that you would take 4 hours to arrive, added to the minutes that the interview would take.\n\nYou showed your support with what you could at the moment. You didn't abandon him for your career choices, since before the interview you said that you would return as soon as the interview ended.\n\nMaybe he needs more time?", "NTA, at all. I say this as a major dog lover who has had to put down  many of my dear family members over the years. Whether a person or animal, his expectation was unfair: give up your dream job bc Rex died. Rex would still be dead regardless of when you arrived at the house. Giving up your future, something deeply affecting both of your lives is illogical.  You were ready and willing to be there to support him through his grief, he made the choice to cut ties. \n\nWhile grief makes us do wild things, and loss of a cherished family member is gutwrenching, it seems worthwhile to reflect on why you would want to continue in a relationship with someone behaving in this way when you did nothing wrong. If this is how he acts before marriage, imagine what he will do after(as that's when most bad behavers go mask off).", "I know I\u2019ll get downvoted for this. But it\u2019s a fucking dog. Do we love them? Yes. Do we think of them as family? Yes. Will I be devastated when mine does? Yes. But the death of a dog is not a reason to demand your partner trash 8 months of work and their shot as their dream job. \n\nGiven you\u2019ve been in a relationship for FIVE YEARS and still aren\u2019t living together, some part of your knows your boyfriend isn\u2019t right for you.\n\nLet Rex not be the only thing that died that day. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "NTA    This feels so wrong.   My family are pet lovers and no one would do this \n\nCalling you 20 minutes before a vitally important interview?!! Feels like sabotage, I don\u2019t care how upset he was \u2026 the call could have waited if he gave a damn about you and your career goals.   \n\nThe cold shoulder is pure petty  nonsense \n\nHe\u2019s grieving but he\u2019s also the AH.", "NTA and I\u2019ll go further. I would NEVER call someone half an hour before their interview and risk upsetting their chances and my dogs are my babies. I would wait a couple of hours and call them straight after. I would call one of my friends/family to help me cope until then.", "NTA it is completely unreasonable to expect someone to miss an important interview in this situation. \n\nEveryone reacts differently in grief but if I were in the same situation and the person I loved had endured an arduous EIGHT MONTH recruitment process and was 30 minutes away from walking into the final interview I like to think that I\u2019d hold off on the phone call until you had finished the interview and could then offer me support. Your (ex?) partner is being the selfish and self-absorbed one here. You can do the interview AND provide support. There was no need to demand you miss the interview and potentially a job offer. \n\nIs your partner jealous about the job and your success? Did they have misgivings about you taking this job if it were to be offered to you?", "Nta - it's not like it happened 24 hours before and you could reschedule the interview. You were actively about to go into the interview and you left as soon as you could.", "I lost my 11 year old dog in November to a pretty sudden onset of seizures that was diagnosed as a brain tumor. She grew up with me from 8 to 19 years old. I was an absolute sobbing mess the entire time.  Being I was your partner I wouldn't have even told you until after the interview. I don't know how you felt about the dog or your relationship with it but I know rhe people I live with were very sad. If they'd had something they worked 8 MONTHS for I would've told them when it was done. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou did not make a choice of career over him. Him and your friends are being silly. You were, rightfully so, of the impression that you could do both. Support him emotionally, and make the interview. His dog was important to him, this interview was important to you, both goals could easily have been achieved if your boyfriend was a bit more mature, and willing to empathize with you and your position. You dont want to be with someone who puts up silly ultimatums like this, that can easily be worked out in a reasonable and beneficial way for both of you, but maybe you should give him some time to get over the worst, and have and discuss it with him. Id probably wave it goodbye, but you figure it out.", "NAH    \nYou didn't NOT support him, you let him know when the interview was over that you would be on the road. You didn't have control over the length of the interview, that isn't on you.  \n  \nOnce you free from the interview and were able to get back to the hotel, you did exactly what you told him you would do.   \n  \nThink long and hard about this relationship, I get that he was in the dark place and that he needed support. At the same time, it has the feeling that he expected you to drop the interview and rush to his side.  \nIt isn't realistic to expect you to sacrifice your whole career and an important opportunity.\n  \nSounds to be that y'all have grown apart and I say to you to think back over your whole relationship and think about how many times you have made sacrifices for him versus him sacrificing for you.", "NTA.", "NTA. Ar 4 hours away, nothing would have changed.  You have the right to look after your future.  You were back to comfort him within 6 hours.  NTA", "My husband and I have been through some really horrid horrid deaths with our dogs and my parents and some family and friends on his side. We were there for each other with all of them. He would not have called me until after the interview. I may have even been mad that he didn't call me but he wouldn't have messed up my career for something I couldn't change. I might have called him, maybe. It would be hard for me to figure out the right thing to do but anyway. NTA. He is grieving and making some terrible choices and therefore I really am hesitant to call him the AH but he is wrong. You cannot miss something like that interview for something you CANNOT change or even have effect on. You wouldn't have gotten there for four hours anyway.\n\nI hope that with some time, maybe a few days he will realize he's being out of line and grieving and apologize to you. If he doesn't then he is the AH and it's time to move on.", "NTA, your dreams are important too.  It was only an extra two hours.  I have a feeling he would have been upset even if you had skipped the interview and if you had done that you would only grow to resent him.  Follow your dreams.", "INFO: Does the boyfriend work? Have his own place? Stable job history?\n\nIt's relevant here because an adult with adult financial obligations should be able to understand financial priorities.", "NTA This is a really shitty situation all around.  But for him to claim you didn't support him isn't fair, nor is it true.  Don't get me wrong I'm someone who considers my pets my family, but it wasn't reasonable for him to not consider the big picture of what would happen if you missed that interview.  He's allowed to be upset about losing his dog, but he's taking it out on you and that's not ok.", "NTA.   Even if you could leave instantly   you were 4 hours away.\n\nYou didn't cancel a nail appt, this was an interview  for your career.  And you left as soon as your could", "NTA. I know your bf is grieving over the loss of his dog, but the fact is, you told him that you will meet him after your interview. Things like this happen in life, and we do not have control over certain situations. Give your bf time, perhaps a few days or a week, and then reach out to him again. If he still doesn't want to talk this matter over like an adult, I am sorry OP, but it's time to break up. You can't put your dreams on hold because of him.", "NTA. Honestly I know your bf is grieving, but this seems like potentially a red flag. He knew how important this job was to you and how long you've been working to get it, and he would rather you spend one extra hour with him and lose the job opportunity, than wait an hour for you and give you that opportunity. It's not like there was ever the possibility that you wouldn't be there for him - the only issue was \\*when,\\* and he would barely have to wait. It's slightly concerning that he would be down to sacrifice your dreams just so that you could come comfort him immediately. People need to be able to rely on their partners emotionally, but sometimes a person needs to know how to self-soothe a bit so that their partner can rely on them as well (like you should have been able to rely on him to wait for you to finish the interview).\n\nI know people can be irrational when in pain, so maybe just try to be there for him and let him calm down a bit. If he can't see reason when he's processed the pain a bit more, he might just be a selfish person.", "I get that he is hurt but you are definitely NTA.\n\nGive him some time. My guess is his emotions will calm down and he will begin to see reason. If he can't forgive you, you can just use the door he closed in your face to move on with your life and career. That's his issue to sort out.\n\nI've lost a dog before. I've lost family before. I would never demand that anyone be there to comfort me against their own priorities, especially something so serious to you as your dream job. You made an effort and did what you said you would do, which should have been enough if he were being understanding. Hopefully he will realize that soon.", "NTA. Losing a pet is very hard. My DIL has lost to family parts in the last month and my moms elderly dad passed 2 weeks ago. You got to you as soon as you could. You leaving before your interview just doesn\u2019t make any sense. You were way to far away to change anything. He is acting out of grief. Congrats on the job.", "NTA. But, I just lost my dog a few weeks ago and was inconsolable and completely irrational for the first few days. If he comes back in the next week or so, maybe hear him out but don't let him hold it against you. You were there when you could be. Congrats on the new job!", "NTA. Your boyfriend was sad and needed support, and I imagine he decided you put yourself first because you didn't drop everything for him. However, it would be unfair of YOU to drop this for him. You could do both things and he didn't like that.\n\nIf your relationship is over or not, that's just life. It's sad but you did what was best for you, without breaking your promise of going to see him as soon as possible.\n\nYour friends, though? I'd drop them.", "Nope you put a lot of effort into the interview process I wouldn\u2019t have left either. I know people value their pets highly but there was too much at stake.", "NTA, and I'm sure he'll be more reasonable about the situation soon. He's grieving and not thinking/acting rationally.", "NTA. You hitting the road 45 minutes later wouldn't have made that much difference. Even if you had left immediately, there are many things that could have extended your travel time.  Flat tire, traffic jam, need food or a bathroom break. Congratulations on your dream job, and think seriously about whether he is the one.", "NTA.  His feelings are valid but his belief that you should give this opportunity up to rush to his side is not valid.  No matter what, you were not going to be there in time for what he wanted.", "NTA. YES, the death of a loved pet is hard but he wanted you to drop everything, including the possibility of a great job, to run home and comfort him.  You were there, just a few hours later.  \n\nHe is upset over the death, yes.  But if this attitude continues, find another man. He doesn't respect you enough to understand how important the interview was.", "NTA. You were already 4 hours away so what was an additional hour and 15 minutes? You would have been a fool to blow your future to drive all the way home. If he can\u2019t see that he\u2019s being selfish.", "NTA but I also don\u2019t think anyone is in this situation. He\u2019s hurt and grieving, it\u2019s normal for people in that position to be spiteful.", "NAH \n\nIt wasn't wrong to go to interview and you left ASAP afterward.  \n\n\nIt is natural and valid that  he feels hurt you didn't rush over, he's not thinking clearly in his grief about other people and their needs. He just feels immense loss 14 years is a long time with a pet. Losing a pet is as hard as losing a person.  \n\nHopefully once the first wave of grief subsides he can listen better.", "You are pursuing a dream.

After about 20 minutes, he asked if I could get on the road to be with him. I said yes, of course, I would do an interview and as soon as I got my things at the hotel, I would hit the road. He was quiet, said okay and wished me good luck. \n\nThe interview was great and the next day I was offered the position, but it lasted longer than expected (30 min and lasted 1h15). As soon as I finished, I texted and called, but no response, so I went to the hotel and took the road arriving at 7PM at his house, I went straight there.\n\n I arrived, he said that he had already buried Rex and that he didn't need my support anymore if I literally chose my career over supporting him emotionally in this loss. \n\nI tried to talk to him saying that it would have taken me at least 4 hours to help him and as soon as the interview ended, which lasted longer than I thought, I tried to talk to him. But he closed the door on my face.\n\nWe're not talking, I don't know if we're going to continue our relationship, I've brought this up to some friends of mine and some have said that in fact I made my career choice over him and his feelings are valid. \n\nI really don't think it is, because anyway I wouldn't be with him for 4 hours and I tried as soon as I could to talk to him, but I couldn't abandon the most important interview?\n\nSo, strangers, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First was our family cat who suddenly became ill. My mum made arrangements to take her to the vet but soonest time available was middle of the day on a week day. I came home to my mum upset and having to tell me Acid (I didn't name the poor thing, my sister did) had an infection in the kidneys and her kidneys were in rapid failure. It was decided at the vets office the kindest thing to do was to let her go and save her further suffering. Was I upset? Hell yes. But not at mum or the vet. I was old enough to understand. At least got to bury her at home.\n\nSecond was our dog Brodie. She'd had a defect with her upper palette her whole life and she was about 12 when it really started horribly affecting her daily life causing breathing and swallowing issues. Vet concluded nothing could be done since very strong danger going under anesthesia would kill her and no guarantee surgery wouldn't make things worse like the other times we'd touched on it through her life. After an extremely bad choking fit my mum and brother rushed her to the emergency vet and it was decided it was time. Once again I was very upset, but understood. She was also buried in our home.\n\n3rd was our last family dog Sarah Jane. She had a birth defect with an enlarged and malformed liver and wasn't meant to live past 5-6 years. She made it to 15. Mum and dad called me the day she showed signs she was done and wanted to move on, the vet confirming her liver was failing finally, but she was in no pain so mum and dad took her home and tucked her into her bed. She passed a few hours later and they called me immediately. This time I was 6hrs away living other end of the state and even if I had started driving after the first call I would have never made it.\n\nAt least with my husband and I got to be there for our cat Meg. She was 18 1/2 (adopted at 11yo and with us 7 year) and passed quietly and comfortably yesterday after a very rapid decline from what vet suspected was a rather aggressive form of bowel cancer that doesn't have obvious lumps or tumors and is spread through the bowel by the time symptoms show. Which explained why we never felt anything cause she LOVED belly rubs by having her belly rubbed and squished so we could have felt any lumps or changes. Her advanced age plus heart murmur meant even mild anesthesia to scan and confirm it wasn't recommended and vet was frank they wouldn't even offer chemo as it was kinda pointless and unnecessary additional stress and discomfort for likely no good out come.

If my dog passed I would be devastated but I wouldn't expect anyone to drop something that important to hold me while I cry.", "I'm a big grief advocate and I wanted to find fault with what you did but -  if my cat died and my SO was in another city, I don't even know if I'd call them until after their interview. Because finding out before the interview could mess up the interview and I wouldn't want to do that, not when their dream job is on the line. So I think NTA.", "He could have waited to tell you. This was a big interview for you. \n\nWhen my mom had to put our dog down, it was over Labor Day weekend in my 20s when I was going to a lake house or something with my friends. She waited to tell me until she knew I was back home so that I could enjoy the weekend and not be super sad and crying about it. I was upset at the time but I understand her intentions with that now, and hell, she was just as upset as I was.", "NTA, move on. you did everything you could.", "NTA. I'm hoping that he said that in his state of grief and didn't really mean it. You didn't \"choose\" your career over him. You have been working towards this for almost a year. Losing a dog is horrible,  I lost mine recently, so I understand the overwhelming grief. He also needs to understand that you you can not drop your life over the death of a dog. As awful as it is to deal with, he shouldn't have expected you to not go to your interview. You did nothing wrong. If you still want to be in a relationship with him, give it time. Hopefully, once his grief gets a little better, he will be more reasonable and realize he was being an ass.", "NTA. He asked you 10 minutes before the interview to leave and drive 4 hours back to him. He knew you had the interview, he was well aware of the time that he called. He could have waited 45 min and called you then. \n\nHe also chose to bury the dog before you got home to \"prove a point\", instead of asking the vet to look after the dog until you were back in town. \n\nGive him some time to grieve before making big decisions.", "NTA, and something I haven\u2019t seen mentioned is the fact you need new friends. Your career is one of if not thee most important and defining aspects of your life. Could mean happiness doing something you love, put you in a comfortable spot financially, or really doing something that makes a differences and changes the lives of others. Skipping the possibility of that for someone else\u2019s dog that passed? Nah, that\u2019s irrational to expect someone to do.", "NTA. And I say that as someone who loves their dog a borderline unhealthy amount. Congratulations on this incredible opportunity!! You made the right decision.", "OP, are you moving to the new city without your bf if younger the new job?", "NTA.\n\nThis is because of the modern attitude that leads many unstable people to try to be as \"victim\" as possible, tantruming over anything, big or small.\n\nYou didn't choose your career over your BF. You tried to deal with the former as fast as possible and then deal with the latter, but no matter how you had handled it, he was going to sulk and blame.\n\nAnd if it hadn't been Rex, it would have been something else. He's a drama queen.\n\nIn fact, you could say that he chose acting out over having a healthy relationship.", "NTA. You\u2019re at the final phase and he should not expect you to throw that away for immediate comfort. You said once your done and comforted him before the interview so you did your duty per the limitations of the situation.", "NTA and you\u2019ve managed to dodge a bullet. The drama queen is all about him. This is not love on his part. Someone who actually cared about you would not have called you until well after the interview time.", "NTA\n\nHe is grieving and might need a little grace here, but if this sort of behavior is typical I would call it a red flag.", "NTA. The dog was already dead. No sense pissing away the opportunity by ditching the interview.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry for his loss.  But his reaction is probably more than just grief talking.  He\u2019s apparently got some resentment over your career move. I think it would have been there with or without his dog\u2019s sad passing.  He almost set this up like a loyalty test. And that\u2019s wrong and completely unnecessary in a healthy relationship. There was room in the circumstances for him to grieve with your support and for you to complete this last part of your career journey.  It would just require a bit of maturity on his part that so far all commenters I\u2019ve read said they would have extended in the same situation.  I believe in their sincerity. \n\nCongratulations on your new job. Best wishes to you for a happy new start and I hope all goes well with your relocation.", "NTA. You got there as soon as you could, as promised. He'll probably realize that once his grief subsides a bit.", "He's grieving, I understand his frustration and lashing out but you are NTA here OP.  The drive was too long for you to be there immediately and your presence (even if you technically had been able to make it in time) would not have saved the dog. You still came immediately after to support him and comfort him. But you aren't superman.", "There was no choice to be made. He\u2019s reacting out of grief. 14 years is a long time to love a pet, both of you know that. He until that moment wanted you to be exactly where you were doing what you were doing. You did support him as much as the situation allowed, and made plans with the best of intentions. When he cools down let\u2019s hope reason returns and you can have a good talk.", "NTA. If he loved you he would have kept the news until the interview was over. There was nothing you could do being 4 hours away other than what you did. It hurts to lose a beloved pet, but his actions are not of a loving supportive bf.", "NTA. You may want to reevaluate this relationship if he expects you to put your entire life\u2019s goals down at the drop of a hat for him like that. It low key sounds like he didn\u2019t want you to get the job in the first place.\n\nLike, the more I think about this, a supportive boyfriend would have told you about the dog after your interview so as not to potentially mess it up.", "NTA and bullshit that his feelings are valid. Let\u2019s be reasonable you\u2026if you left when he asked you would have arrived what an hour earlier? At that point Rex is already gone. There\u2019s no point in skipping the interview and you went to him immediately after, not a day or two later.", "Yeah NTA.\n\nNo reason you couldn't have done that interview first. An extra 1 hour 15 for a life changing interview on top of a 4 hour drive anyway is nothing.", "NTA", "Um. Well, NAH (no a here? Is that how it's done?). You do have extenuating circumstances, but the problem is the loss of Rex is a personal devastation to your boyfriend. Do not get him a new puppy, first and foremost.\n\nYou have to decide if you want to court, comfort, tell him how you love him, tell him his feelings are valid.\n\nYour career choice was valid, too, which is an unfortunate truth. It delayed you, but at that moment, he was devastated and wanted you. This is what needs to be acknowledged. Eventually, he may also be able to acknowledge that you needed to go to that job interview.\n\nBut he might not be able to recover from you not coming to him when he really wanted you. So, yes. It may be the end of your relationship. His feelings are valid, but you are two people, not an amoeba.", "NTA\n\nYour career takes precedent here. I feel bad that his dog passed away, but to call you before the interview and ask you to skip out on the interview is a little extreme. \n\nSounds like the relationship is over. On the flipside you are now a bachelorette in a new city with a great job. The world is your oyster.", "So basically so he thinks you should should of thrown your chance at your dream job just to could come home an hour and half early ? \n\n Seems like he is trying to sabotage your dreams so he can keep you around .", "NTA.

I worked with the vet nurse to start the process of getting him cremated.

And he is making you feel guilty because he feels guilty for something.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend wanted you to sacrifice your hard work for something he didn't need you for. I have lost pets, and it's painful to say goodbye but not ruin your life painful. \n\nAt this point, I am getting the feeling that your boyfriend is jealous of your success and wants to sabotage your career goals.\n\nThe friends that agree with him I guarantee don't support your goals and drive too. They don't have your best interests at heart.", "N T A  move to the new job, sorry for his loss. He has no right to lord that over you, you did the best you could. Start your new life knowing you don\u2019t need to shoulder his burdens. You can be supportive, but his feelings are not your fault.", "NTA.  Ok, I lost my dog who was the same age almost a yr ago.  To this day I mourn him.  I've had other dogs but I had emotional connection with my beloved Shadow.  This is to say I should understand his side.  But I don't.  I'm forever alone so I can't put myself in his shoes for this part.  But I know I'd never expect my imaginary SO to drop something so important to rush back to me.  If he was willing to come immediately after and did as you did that would mean THE WORLD to me.  He's lucky.  \n\nAlso this wasn't you choosing your career over him.  I'd say those aren't very supportive friends.\n\nAs for him not everyone handles grief well.  Some lash out in anger and he likely is one that does so.  I wish you luck luv.", "INFO:\n\nHad you ever met Rex before this?", "Calling her with bad news and expecting support just before this long awaited interview?? He\u2019s lucky she was taking calls. He\u2019s an idiot to not understand timing issues.  I could forgive saying something crass immediately after. Stupid words fall out in crisis. Carrying on later is stupid. Are your friends who think you did something wrong children?", "NTA - BF needs to grow up. OP was out of town on a business trip/interview that was the culmination of 8 months of work. Rex was 14 years old and presumably lived a good life. No ages stated but assuming OP & BF are younger and still climbing the ladder, not with a comfortable nest egg & looking for an excuse to retire. Now is the time to concentrate on seting themselves up for the future, not deliberately sabotaging to dwell on the past. If BF can't understand that, I would recommend OP reevaluate her relationship...and if the company happens to offer her a better role in the other city, she should this as a sign to take it.", "NTA. I absolutely LOVE my dog, and he\u2019s healthy enough that if he died it would be a huge shock as well as incredibly sad. But if he died there\u2019s no way I would expect my SO to cancel an interview they\u2019d prepped 8 months for. Grief is a long process, it\u2019s not over and done with in less than 24 hours.", "NTA.\n\nI know that losing a beloved pet is devastating. That doesn't mean the world stops. You were there for him in the capacity you could be. I'm sorry, but if he can't give you 2-3 hours to tie up loose ends (you know, the whole reason you made the trip in the first place) then he's being selfish in the extreme and you should think about this. Does he have no other friends or family who could have been with him in the moment? Are you solely responsible for his emotional well-being? That's a heavy load and I'd take this as a wake-up call and examine your relationship.\n\nHow he reacted is not normal IMO.", "Boyfriend is immature, self centered and selfish\u2026.and stupid. Take your dream job and move on. You\u2019ll be much happier in the long run.", "NTA", "Grief does strange things to people but BF is acting like a crazy person.\n\nYou didn't make a choice between your career and a dog - you took every reasonable action in a somewhat difficult situation.  And for the record, pets are cool but your career is, in fact, more important than the life of any fucking dog.

I don\u2019t normally comment, but what the hell!?!?!  This is a job interview.  You were already there.  Even if you weren\u2019t already there, it\u2019s a dog!  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have two 17 year old dogs who are nearing the end, but for him to expect you to skip an interview for his dog?  Get out of here with that nonsense.", "NTA - OP, if you get this job, move and leave this guy behind.\n\nLeave him behind even if you don\u2019t get the job too.", "NTA.

It would have just resulted in your missing out on your dream job. And frankly, if a grown adult human expects their partner to put their life on hold and give up opportunities instead of simply dealing with their emotions by themselves for a short period of time, that is a major cause for concern.\n\nCongratulations and good luck with the job!", "NTA, but I\u2019m not surprised by his reaction because I know how much that HURRRTS. After 14 years. He\u2019s most likely thinking irrationally. He gets a pass (from me anyway haha) for a day or two. If he doesn\u2019t apologize eventually, that\u2019s not okay. A career, a DREAM career, is not something to take lightly. And yeah you were already too far away to be there for him. Gosh I hope it all works out.", "NTA find another person", "NTA.

Or rage-burying his dog so he could throw it in your face as some fucked-up \u201cso there!\u201d??\n\nYou did everything you could to comfort him and then you came back immediately afterwards.

I'm very sorry the dog died and it's horrible for your BF but you did have to put your career first you're young if you don't do it now then when?", "NTA, WTF. You were 4 hours away and having an interview for a job you really wanted. I wouldn't even expect my wife to wrap that up if a family member died. Do the interview and come back. That is not anything but sensible. You couldn't change what happened, why possibly affect your whole life for something that had already occurred. This is more about him and his inability to be an adult and handle his grief for an extra couple of hours. You could have just as easily been delayed with a flat tyre or a traffic jam that would have delayed you.", "NTA. Consider this a bullet dodged.

Look sister, you need to dump this dude. Your job is very important. His pain is real, but you have obligations. He is manipulating you and showing you many red flags \ud83d\udea9 here.

Anyone who can\u2019t handle that part shouldn\u2019t have pets in the first place. Obviously support and help are regular and expected parts of any interpersonal relationship, to varying degrees.

Doesn\u2019t mean it means or hurts any less.", "Because it\u2019s highly unlikely that this type of selfishness is restricted to a single occasion.  It is entitled behavior and it didn\u2019t just pop up out of nowhere.\n\nAlso, you could left out the last part of your comment.  It really was unnecessary and rude for no reason. \n\nI don\u2019t know how my comment indicates I crave drama.  There\u2019s plenty enough of that to go round on this thread and in this sub.", "True.", "IDK, I think there's a benefit to a truly neutral, anonymous audience's take on whatever someone feels they need to post. Your friends and family will have biases that can inhibit them from being 100% forthcoming to try to spare feelings and preserve relationships. \n\nThe internet dgaf.", "Yeah, there's a friend I text when I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. I've gotten the full range of judgements over the years.", "It would be selfish to wish it were the other way around.  I wouldn't want them to outlive me and wonder why I abandoned them.", "Honestly makes me wonder if he\u2019s not happy about her getting a job and putting down further roots 4 hours away from him\u2026..", "If she did have an emotional connection to the dog he easily could have ruined her chances to get the job. I understand grief and wanting support but there is a right time to break the news of a death- *even a dog\u2019s!!*- and it\u2019s not before a job interview.", "That detail jumped out to me too immediately as a huge red flag. When our family dog of a similar age died, who was like a family member to me, I was living abroad and while my job was nowhere near as prestigious as OP's, my mom still waited to tell me until she knew I wasn't at work.\n\nThen OP rushes home and BF shuts the door in her face but not before he says all of that? He doesn't seem to have been looking for support, he was just trying to exercise his perceived control over his -hopefully ex- girlfriend.\n\nI get that he lost someone important to him but I'm not sure I'd try to ruin someone else's achievements over my own grief/feelings and I say it from experience that that kind of person is not worth keeping in your life OP. No matter the amount of pain anyone's in, you're not their punching bag. And good luck with your new job in that new town!", "I was thinking the same thing. Knowing what time the interview is why would you call and drop such a emotional bombshell on her 30mins before. She needed to be in the best mind space as possible. \nAlso she called immediately after her interview (no answer) and hopped right on the road.\nSounds like jealousy on the bf part and like he wanted to sabotage.", "My thoughts exactly. Why would you even call her? An hour or two isn't going to make any difference in the outcome. I absolutely love my fur babies, but I would have waited.", "Right????? That's what I thought too. Just as much his dog meant to him, OP had a dream job on the line. Not to mention giving her support and encouragement right before such an important event, to nearly sabotage her by making childish demands to abandon her chances at her dream job? OP dodged a bullet with this one. Who does he think he is?", "It\u2019s not odd, sometimes when someone is close to their animals they will bury them at home. This is probably not something they want to wait to do. However I think he was a total dick to her. And she should focus on her career.", "Is Rex even real?", ">So boyfriend buried the dog immediately? Isn't that a little odd?\n\nWhen my pets died, I wanted to put them to rest as soon as possible.", "No, not odd. Rather normal. Rex is a dog. It's not like they have to send him to a coroner to do an autopsy and make sure it wasn't foul play (I've been rewatching the Bones series lately).", "Very odd & surprising. Boyfriend had to deal with the news, go to the vet, settle everything there, get home with the dog, dig an appropriately deep grave, & bury the poor dog. That would take more than 5/hours for me.", "This killed me\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I mean no, but we were for the first 2 years, and I know people who have been together similarly long amounts of time who haven't moved in together. Or who didn't move in together till around 5 or 6 years. My exes brother and his fiance for instance didn't live together till after they'd been together for 6 years, just because of where their jobs where. One of my friends has been with her bf for 4 years and they don't live together yet (she's planning to move in with him in the near future though). So it does happen with people in their early to mid 20s. Honestly I don't see anything that says they didn't start dating in college, which could put them as young as 23 or so, or if they started dating in high school even younger", "True. Plus worth the job stuff, sounds like something you do shortly after college. So early to mid 20's is definitely possible. \n\nI'm feeling like he has some insecurities about having to follow her for work,  didn't want to move,  and forced a choice on her. If you've been with someone for five years, you should be pretty committed to the best interest of both parties. I'm blown away this behavior came from anyone that's grown out of their teens."]}
