I (16m) met his wife and her daughter just under 2 months ago. They had a long distance relationship before that. Dad's stepdaughter is 4. The incident in question happened a week ago. My dad's wife's daughter wasn't home. I think she was with a friend of my dad's or something. But they did that so they could talk to me. Dad's wife told me that she and my dad needed me to know that her daughter would need me more than ever. She told me that while she was married to her ex husband she had an affair and that her daughter was born as a result of the affair and that her older kids all made it clear they were disgusted by her and found her repulsive as an affair baby and she said they made it clear they would never consider her a sibling or treat her the same as they treat each other because she's tainted by the way she was born and all this stuff. She told me that meeting my dad was the best thing ever and she was so grateful they had the chance to move so her daughter wouldn't grow up feeling hated every day and so she had the chance at a family who would love her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated.\n\nI didn't really get why she was telling me at that moment and I felt like it was a weird thing to bring up to me. So I asked why this stuff was my problem when they were still practically strangers to me. They got mad and told me that was a horrific way to react to being told \"my new sister\" was treated terribly before and hated for something she could not control. They told me it should be obvious why I was being told, because they wanted me to make an effort to be her older brother and not just a stepbrother she lived  with for two years and then turned his back on her once he was out of the house. They said I could be a great addition to her life and I should be honored that I get the chance to have a sibling because losing my mom so young and dad not finding anyone else special until years later meant I could have remained an only child forever. My reaction was not what they liked and then they told me my attitude was a problem and my reaction to being given relevant information as well as my lack of enthusiasm to be there for dad's new stepdaughter was painting me in a negative light.\n\nDad's wife told me I was lucky they had the foresight not to say this with her daughter in the house because it would be crushing for a little girl to pick up on my lack of affection for her. I asked where the affection was meant to come from after so little time and being thrown together as strangers.\n\nThe last week they have made comments about my attitude and my dad told me I was out of order being so rude and dismissive with my \"why's this my problem\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699880941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uaa1u/aita_for_asking_my_dad_and_his_new_wife_why_is/", "score": 2311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forcing these things never works and your dad and SM are delusional.", "NTA\n\nYou asked a very good question\u2026 why is it your problem? You should ask your Dad some more questions like \u2026. why he believes it\u2019s an \u201chonor\u201d for you to be responsible for a toddler while you\u2019re a teenager. Also, if you\u2019re responsible for the emotional wellbeing of the 4 year old, who\u2019s going to be responsible for your emotional wellbeing since you\u2019re still a minor?\n\nThese adults have some issues. Out of curiosity what is the age difference between your Dad & his wife?", "NTA Wow, your Dad messed up big time here. Your StepMom cheating and her daughter being the result of her cheating is not your problem. You are absolutely correct. Would it be nice if you did treat her like a sister? Yeah, but you are by no means obligated. Them trying to force you into this sounds mentally unhinged. My guess, she wants you to be a \u201cbrother\u201d to her daughter so she can have free babysitting and dump her kid on you. Also, doesn\u2019t your Dad take her being a cheater and acting like this as a \ud83d\udea9? My advice, talk to your Dad alone. If that doesn\u2019t work, try to be civil but keep your distance until you can move out.", "NTA. You've been an only child for 16 years and suddenly you're supposed to be a big brother! They're acting like you should magically know everything they want from you. Maybe you can form a good bond with her, but it's something that must happen naturally. It can't be forced. They can't expect you to suddenly be a brother.", "NTA. Wait, so did your new step-mother abandon her other children after her affair? She\u2019s a real piece of work.", "NTA, and I think that was a great question. It really is not your problem. Her daughter\u2019s mental health is the mom\u2019s responsibility and the affair baby issues are a result of the mom\u2019s actions and also responsibility. She\u2019s not accepting any of that responsibility, and is trying to shift it to her new step kid. That\u2019s vile. Not your circus and not your monkeys.", "NTA, I am confused as to what being an \"older sibling\" means to them.\n\nLike, the child is openly disdained and disparated by half siblings, so anything less than that?  It's easily done as all you need to do is not be mean to this kid.\n\nNo teen wants to hang out with a toddler.  If you had wanted to constantly hang out with a baby, you would have gotten a girl pregnant.  Then, it would be an obligation to hang out with said child.", "This literally happened to me at 16 except the daughters were 8 and 10 and I was expected (by my stepmom) to quit my extracurriculars so that I could help get them to school in the morning and be there when they get home. They also needed me to do all of the cooking and cleaning until they got home.\n\nThis was after my dad had been dating another woman for  years who had two sons the same age as me and my little brother. We had become best friends and already considered ourselves siblings. My dad had to move for work but said that she and her sons would be joining us soon. They never did and he would never tell me why but a year or so later, he announced that we were going to visit a \"friend\" of his who had two daughters that couldn't wait to meet me. \n\nI told him that I didn't understand why he was telling me this, and that I'm not going to befriend two children. I was obedient, but I went armed with enough batteries, CDs, and extra pairs of headphones so that I could completely ignore all of them. We get there and these girls have already been told that I'm their big sister and they want to show me all of their Barbies and other childish crap. I couldn't be mean to innocent children but I did my best to stay away from them because I didn't want to be their family. My dad and the woman were cuddled up and I'm slowly realizing that my dad is a cheater (\ud83e\udd23). I'm furious. I confronted him and that's when I found out that he and the woman I thought was going to be my stepmom broke up quite some time ago and he started dating this new woman.\n\nThey got married a few months later and I did not attend.\nOnce she moved in that's when all the bullshit started and eventually she drove me and my little brother away and back to our mom. I didn't speak to my dad for like the first two or three years of college. We're all good now, and the girls became cool after they hit adulthood and we could actually have things in common. But that was the worst damn way to introduce me and I'm still not necessarily close with my stepmom because of the stuff mentioned in the first paragraph and some other stuff with her trying to drive my little brother away specially (they asked him to leave; I just went with him because I'm a loyal sister).\n\nEvery time I bring it up now, my dad just listens quietly but doesn't say anything. I don't think he realized the impact that it has had on me but at this point I also don't think he cares. He thinks I should just get over it. I have a hard time letting people in and loving people and this just made it worse because I thought I had two new brothers and they just literally disappeared from my life and I could do nothing to stop it.\n\nThis was years ago long before long distance calls were cheap and I didn't even have my own cell phone. I have no way to find the two guys that were basically my brothers because they have super common names and people don't really use their real names or their actual photos on Facebook these days. I thought I found one a few years ago but he never responded to my message. I've never seen or heard from them again. At this point, they may not even remember me or maybe their mom told them bad things about us and they don't want to talk to me. I didn't get closure so I can't forgive or move all the way on. \n\nMy step sisters and I talked about it when I came back from college and I explained all of this and they thought that the situation was completely screwed up and they understood why I was the way I was. Maybe you won't be her friend now because there's so much difference in age, but when she gets a little bit older, you might find you like her. And when she's old enough you can explain the whole situation.", "NTA\nIs there any other family you can reach out to about this?  You aren't your stepsisters emotional support brother and the two adults involved need a swift kick up the backside and to land back in reality.

They said I could be a great addition to her life and I should be honored that I get the chance to have a sibling because losing my mom so young and dad not finding anyone else special until years\n\nSounds to me like she is trying to manipulate you. I would on guard around her. NTA", "NTA honestly they sound a little deluded thinking you could meet a child 12 years younger than you and have a sibling bond within two months. It\u2019s ridiculous and your dad is risking alienating you to fulfil his wife\u2019s fantasy. \n\nIt\u2019s unreasonable to put this much pressure on you to fill the shoes your step-siblings didn\u2019t want to, and it\u2019s even worse that they\u2019re trying to force it so quickly.", "NTA.

Tell them to take it up with the source.", "nta. you\u2019ve known this child for two months. you are twelve years older than her. pushing this on you so forcefully is a great way to ensure a relationship doesn\u2019t happen, but realistically it probably wouldn\u2019t have happened regardless. you\u2019re sixteen. the odds of you wanting to hang out with a four year old are not great, and dad\u2019s wife and her kid moving in one month after you met them (i am assuming they moved in after the wedding) is not going to help. hitting you with \u201cshe\u2019s an affair baby and my other kids hate her so you need to be the best brother ever\u201d is absolutely not going to help. if she\u2019s so concerned with her kid she should\u2026 let her get to know you and your dad before moving her in with you, maybe? like they should have done with you? \n\nand did she just abandon her older kids or what? idk. i have questions. \n\nyou could have been more diplomatic, sure, but when you\u2019re building your perfect fairy tale family it is important to check in with the people you\u2019re expecting to take part in that. it doesn\u2019t sound like that happened, except as an after thought.", "NTA. \n\nYour dad married someone that had an affair that resulted in a child with the affair partner. \n\nObviously he does not have the best judgment. Maybe he\u2019s desperate and not only willing to ignore the red flags but compromise your life just so he can hold on to someone who has already shown she\u2019s selfish and untrustworthy. \n\nMy advice is to listen to the Penguins of Madagascar, \u201csmile and wave\u201d. Keep the peace without committing to anything yourself and get out as soon as possible. \nKeeping the peace will allow you to plan and take action without them sabotaging your efforts. Then once you\u2019re independent tell them the truth. \n\n\u201cYou forced this relationship/responsibility on me to ensure your own happiness. You didn\u2019t care about how things would affect me, you just wanted to use me as a resource to keep your marriage.

Then you will take your own path and build your own life. \n\nAt this point I really see no point in forcing a relationship with a toddler on you.

You already lost your stable family and now some new fucks are making demands?

Do you have grandparents who you can go to if this situation doesn't work out?", "Well, your not wrong. But you could have stated it better. However being 16, you may still lack the ability to understand having a little more softness to your verbiage. \n\nI seriously question the thinking of adults to speak to you in this manner and to put these expectations on you. You are a 16 year old boy, she is a 4  year old girl. Even natural siblings with that age gap, would not be likely to have a close relationship. They would have nothing in common. That is not to say they would not love each other and care for each other, they just would not have a lot in common. \n\nSo to set the expectation that you have that relationship with her so quickly, is odd. \n\nAlso, telling a 16 year old the information they gave you is just way to much. They set you up to feel a lack of respect for both the new wife and the child. When you say to a child: this is the situation and this is how others reacted to it, it can make the child believe that that is the normal reaction. So they end up having the same reaction. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You can, and you will, I hope, extend pity towards this little girl, because she has had a rough start in life, much as you would feel sorry for any other toddler, who came with this background.

The relationship may develop over time, but it can't be forced.", "Look, man, legitimate question. They didnt organize their thoughts productively and you had to ask what the damned thesis was. \n\nMaybe explain to them that you're *open* to a relationship with the kid and don't have anything against her, but they need to recognize that relationships don't come out of nowhere. Also, recommend family therapy so someone with authority can tell them to back. Off. If they want you guys to get to know each other.

Even if you \u201csoftened\u201d it somehow and asked what it has to do with you, or why her decisions and their treatment of their younger sister should impact you, etc. you\u2019d likely still get the same reaction.

And now he wants to commandeer you to make up for his wife's selfishness and her older kids' meanness, so that she doesn't have to see her child suffer the consequences of her own actions, without her actually having to take responsibility for those actions or do any work to help her own child beyond marrying a man with a suitable child to be commandeered into service.

I feel bad for your step-sis and I've never even met her (although mostly because your step-mom is her parent). All you had to say was \"That sucks.

You're a 16 year old kid and have absolutely no responsibility towards your dad's new wife or her kid. Also, there is zero reason for your dad's new wife to essentially dump her infidelity and past onto your lap like you somehow have a need for that kind of information and how, because of her actions, you now have to help with the consequences of what she did. I feel for the littler girl and how her siblings treated her - if they actually treated her that way - is terrible. However, you are essentially a stranger to her. It would be one thing had they sat you down and asked for you to just put in effort to get to know her or be kind to her - which again is not your responsibility - but they didn't. *They* overstepped and dumped her bs onto your lap and are now mad when you didn't jump for joy at the 'job' of being a doting older brother to a kid you don't even know.", "A more tactful, and perhaps more accurate, response might have been \"I am sympathetic that she went through that rejection. Understand though that she and you are strangers to me, and love and affection does not just spring up because my Dad now has a relationship. In fact, I am dealing with the major change of not having my father's primary attention. We all have adjustments to make, and I will try to make the situation work.\" However, you are 16 and dealing with these changes and presented rather bluntly with this talk, so that level of perspective is not to be expected. \n\nI hope you have a trusted adult outside this situation who will help you understand and navigate without taking the issues that arise personally", "NTA - but maybe you could have handled it a bit better.", "YTA there is no reason to start drama.", "ESH. I know people have gotten a little ruder with verbiage, but you could be kind and diplomatic. Although your Dad is a little clueless about broaching a delicate situation so maybe he just got out of you what he had taught you. It\u2019s not your problem and you don\u2019t have to be the grown up in this situation. But you can. You can be the better person. You can set an example for the little girl. You can choose a path to be more.", "NTA. But give the kid a chance", "ESH.  This is one of those situations where they are mishandling it, but don't seem to have done anything hurtful to you, as far as I can tell, and it's just about having empathy for a little kid.  The not asshole way of responding would have been \"That's so sad for her, I promise to treat her kindly like I would any four year old.\". Because if your natural tendency is to be cruel to little kids, you are an asshole.  \n\nAnd yes, be wary of stepmom for sure.

I (16m) met his wife and her daughter just under 2 months ago. They had a long distance relationship before that. Dad's stepdaughter is 4. The incident in question happened a week ago. My dad's wife's daughter wasn't home. I think she was with a friend of my dad's or something. But they did that so they could talk to me. Dad's wife told me that she and my dad needed me to know that her daughter would need me more than ever. She told me that while she was married to her ex husband she had an affair and that her daughter was born as a result of the affair and that her older kids all made it clear they were disgusted by her and found her repulsive as an affair baby and she said they made it clear they would never consider her a sibling or treat her the same as they treat each other because she's tainted by the way she was born and all this stuff. She told me that meeting my dad was the best thing ever and she was so grateful they had the chance to move so her daughter wouldn't grow up feeling hated every day and so she had the chance at a family who would love her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated.\n\nI didn't really get why she was telling me at that moment and I felt like it was a weird thing to bring up to me. So I asked why this stuff was my problem when they were still practically strangers to me. They got mad and told me that was a horrific way to react to being told \"my new sister\" was treated terribly before and hated for something she could not control. They told me it should be obvious why I was being told, because they wanted me to make an effort to be her older brother and not just a stepbrother she lived  with for two years and then turned his back on her once he was out of the house. They said I could be a great addition to her life and I should be honored that I get the chance to have a sibling because losing my mom so young and dad not finding anyone else special until years later meant I could have remained an only child forever. My reaction was not what they liked and then they told me my attitude was a problem and my reaction to being given relevant information as well as my lack of enthusiasm to be there for dad's new stepdaughter was painting me in a negative light.\n\nDad's wife told me I was lucky they had the foresight not to say this with her daughter in the house because it would be crushing for a little girl to pick up on my lack of affection for her. I asked where the affection was meant to come from after so little time and being thrown together as strangers.\n\nThe last week they have made comments about my attitude and my dad told me I was out of order being so rude and dismissive with my \"why's this my problem\".\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They are trying to put too much responsibility into your shoulders. I feel desperately sorry for that little girl, but if she is as damaged as your stepmother fears, then expecting you to somehow make up to her for how she was treated by her half siblings is too much stress on you.  It isn't your responsibility to do this. Having to adjust to a stepmother and stepsister is already highly challenging for you and to add this pressure on the top is insensitive to you.

You can't manufacture affection, and that's pretty much what they are asking you to do. \n\nAs a 16 year old, there isn't a heck of a lot you're going to have in common or share with a 4 year old, other than maybe dinner time.  And you are likely to be out of the house in a few years (maybe not 2 exactly, but likely not long after that).  It's almost as if they're asking you to be a junior parent to a child you've barely met. \n\nBe kind to her, don't absolutely ignore her, don't be mean to her.  That's plenty.", "NTA\n\nYou can't force a sibling relationship like they are trying.

Assuming you go to college or move away, there\u2019s not going to be much of a relationship, especially given the age difference, and you aren\u2019t responsible for this kid\u2019s trauma.

I have two step-siblings and five stepdaughters (over two husbands).   Everyone is over 18 now, so we are past most problems.  My advice is simple: keep an open mind and just be kind to your stepsister.  She\u2019s done nothing wrong.  If you grow to love her, great!  If not, that\u2019s ok too\u2026but be kind anyway.  Don\u2019t let your father and stepmother taint any feelings.  Relationships have to happen organically.  They can\u2019t be forced.

I think it's hard enough for biological siblings to bond with that age difference, let alone someone you just met and you didn't have that \"anticipatory worth time\" to get used to it during a pregnancy. \n\nThe fact that they're trying to force you to be the best big brother ever is stupid and creating a hostile environment for both you and kid. They're setting her up to be disappointed and they're making you uncomfortable. There are plenty of only children in the world who grow up just fine without sibling love.\n\nLook I know people try advocate open communication and all that, but from your comments, it doesn't seem like they're open to listening to you at all and aren't gonna let this go. I suggest \"agreeing\" in very vague terms. \"I understand\u2026 mhmm\u2026 okay\" And then don't (unless you want to, kid might be a blast to hang out with) Then be out of the house, do extracurriculars, get a job, hang out at a friend's house a lot.\n\nBe respectful and kind to her, but you are in no way obligated to clean up her mother's mess.", "NTA\n\nIt's a legit question.\n\nBut at the same time, I do feel for the kid.

But at the same time, it wouldn't be fair to the older siblings to force them to live with the constant reminder either.  Again, one more reminder that cheaters aren't just effecting themselves, but a whole range of people.", "NTA with me and my (step-)bro it took about 10 years before we started referring to each other as brothers and honestly not sure if it would've ever happened if not for our shared (half-) brother.\n\nThese things take time, and sometimes they never happen, but forcing it is generally a way to ruin any chance of it happening", "Your stepmom is passing off her consequences to you. It\u2019s her guilt for the life she has created for her daughter. And while I feel very badly for her daughter, cheaters deserve the bad circumstances they created. The crazy thing is that if they had played it cool, maybe you would\u2019ve learned to love her like a sister. I\u2019m sorry your dad has failed you and failed to consider your feelings on this issue. She will likely cheat on him and her cycle will continue. Did you ever ask him what makes him think she won\u2019t cheat on him?\n\nWith that said, if I was in your shoes, I would tell them both that they are wrong for trying to force this family relationship on you and to expect love instantaneously. I would tell your dad that you are deeply hurt and feel somewhat abandoned by him. I would also try and spend time with your step sister because she\u2019s the only one you live with that hasn\u2019t deeply hurt and manipulated you. She really needs a positive influence as her mother is trash and her step that\u2019s lost his mind. I\u2019m not suggesting this because you owe her or them, but why not focus some of your energy on building at least one positive family relationship. I would also make very clear to dad and SM that you are treating her nicely because you are a good person and not because the required love on demand. I would end the conversation or letter (I\u2019d prefer writing a letter and reading it to them) by telling them you just want to live your last 2 years in relative peace.

Some people are projecting their own experiences and misery onto you. \n\nWere you and your Dad close before his new wife entered the picture?  I'm asking because it is somewhat important.  For however long your dad has been with his new wife, he's been hearing about how her siblings have treated her.  He's spent a lot of time with her and he probably cares about her.  He's also had a lot of conversations with his new wife about how great it will be for the child (who is completely innocent in all of this) to finally live in a home with a big brother who doesn't see her as a constant reminder that Mom stepped out.\n\nBy saying what you said, and you are NOT wrong, you essentially shattered the fantasy new mom created and them shared with your dad.  They are not being reasonable.  Had they included you when they were in a long distance relationship - did she ever stay with your dad in your house?  It doesn't sound like it.  But maybe speak with your dad alone and ask him why he didn't include you?  Remind him that they may be family to him, but they are strangers to you and it exceed the bounds of reason for him to think otherwise and expect you to suddenly have the relationship her mom has fantasized about for ... however long she's had it.\n\nOP, there is no proof from you wrote that they expect you to be a free babysitter.  When you speak with your father, do it alone and preferably out of the house because if the wife is there, you may feel ganged up on.  You can apologize for your phrasing and say perhaps you should have said it differently and that you are not opposed to a relationship with the girl, but them forcing you to suddenly embrace her as they have may very well lead to resentment.  Ask him to let it flow naturally and (I don't know how you feel about the child) that you're open to the idea of being a big brother, but emotionally you're not there YET.\n\nFinally, I have a feeling the child is a brat because her mother probably spoiled her to compensate for the treatment by her siblings. For now, that isn't her fault, though if she is a brat, it will be a little harder to bond with her.  Unless you've had a shitty relationship with your dad for a while, don't let internet strangers guide you to that. Give them a chance and maybe (hopefully) you and the girl will naturally form the bond her mother dreams of because it is very possible.  You are NTA.  Your father really screwed up by keeping a distance between you and the (now) wife and her daughter.  Ask him why he chose to do that, but not in a way where he will get defensive.  He made that choice and your reaction to it now should not be a surprise.\n\nGood luck with all of this.  I would love for you to give an update on this.\n\n(I deleted my 1st post because I accidentally hit add comment prematurely).", "Agree NTA. Parents need to manage this kind of situation as the adults and let you develop your relationships with your steo family in your own time (and only if you even want a relationship with them). \n\nAlso agree on the framing. While managing what's going on with your 4 year old step sibling is not your responsibility and you deserve a chance to get to know everyone on your own time and terms, hopefully the situation still gives you some compassion for the 4 year old. While it's not, \"your problem,\" I also feel really bad for the four year old in this situation because they are a victim too.\n\nI have 3 step siblings and I'm way older than them by about the same age gap. While I needed to form my own relationship with them, I would have been upset if they were being bullied. I would feel the same way about any 4 year old being bullied like that. It's definitely not your responsibility to fix it, but experiencing some compassion knowing the step sibling didn't choose this anymore than you did and is a much younger child might be reasonable. It doesn't mean you have to do anything about it though or have a close relationship or any relationship with your step family.

OP's dad gonna end up getting cheated on as soon as he has to work extra hours for a month and she will say some bs like \"we drifted apart, you didn't give me enough attention, it's your fault I cheated\"", "You can tell he wasn't abusive because all of the children sided with him.", "RIGHT?! those poor kids! Literally abandoned for their mom\u2019s affair baby.", "I think both can be true. Some of the stuff she told me they said is like what someone would say in anger and I could see if they hated her for cheating, that they might hate the youngest too and could say awful things and be really cruel about her. But I could see it being that bad/made worse because my dad's wife was trying to push a bond.", "I\u2019m also one of 3 full biological siblings. The extent of me and the one 3 years apart hanging out in high school was just some chats here and there. The one ten years younger and I would hang out more often because I would babysit him a lot since the other sibling had a lot of sports events we didn\u2019t want to go to. Good sibling bonds are weird in the sense that I would absolutely give my liver, but I would never give up a charger for them. They aren\u2019t this magical unbreakable bond parents seem to believe they are", "How is that what you got from that?", "Right? It is so tone deaf and condescending to act like teens have nothing better to do than to hang out with a toddler who just appeared in front of them LOL\n\nI have all sorts of criticisms about teens but their lives are busy. Social lives, teen and friend drama, hobbies, school, part time work, dating, driving school, getting into college. And that's just normal teen stuff.", "I would give a hard no under all circumstances", "This is some terrible advice. \n\n1. He will not be babysitting if he does not want to, his step sister is not his responsibility, it\u2019s his stepmom\u2019s. \n\n2. And how dare you even suggest that if he doesn\u2019t bond with this 4 year old stranger, he\u2019ll be an incel. What about stepmom\u2019s other kids that rejected their half sister? I guess they\u2019re all incel material? 16 year olds have much better stuff to do with their time than hang out with a toddler.\n\n3. Also I love how the parents are all stepsister this stepsister that, but no one has considered OP\u2019s feelings. But *HE\u2019S* the self centered one? He just met these people 2 months ago!\n\nOP\u2019s only obligation is to live in that house and be cordial to everyone. If relationships between him and his new stepmom and stepsister naturally develop, great! If not, then it\u2019s whatever. Saying he should be forced into playing along to cater to this 4yo will only cause him resentment to everyone in that house and push him further away as an adult. Also what would happen if OP\u2019s dad and stepmother get divorced in a few years when she fucks another dude and ruins her marriage? I bet daddy will be wishing he didn\u2019t push OP away during this time.", "I'm sorry, but you are very condescending, and I believe totally wrong.  OP is a 16 year boy whose life has taken a very strange turn and you seem to think he needs to \"be a big brother\" to a 4 year old toddler that has been just thrust upon him? \n\nOP has every right to his own feelings. These people are strangers that just popped up his life, and his father isn't giving him time to adjust. His father needs to consider his sons feelings and emotions, as well. \n\nThis is the introduction his father has forced on him. It is entirely possible that OP may never accept these people as a mother and sister. Trying to force relationships just don't work.  Of course, he has to put up with the situation for 2 more years but reddit is full of stories of people being told they suddenly have \"little brothers and sisters\" and the reactions sometimes don't work out as the parents assume they will.\n\nI'm so sorry about your crazy situation, OP. I really do hope you can find peace with the situation someday.  But, you never know, that 4 year old toddler may one day be a very important part of your life. Don't burn that bridge completely, maybe? Good luck, kiddo. I wish you the best.", "That's what I was wondering.  The stage after telling someone 'sob story' doesn't work, is sometimes anger and manipulation.", "I get it but I have no doubts that she's someone else's kid.", "Yep. Even if the affair child was indeed ostracized at home, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s gonna play it up as much as she can to victimize herself. But she could also be lying.", "> They said I could be a great addition to her life and I should be honored that I get the chance to have a sibling because losing my mom so young and dad not finding anyone else special until years later \n\nIs English not your first language? If so I can understand you not understand how this is literally telling him he should be honored to be able to be in the same building as her.", "So wouldn't that mean that the new sister he didn't choose isn't his problem? His dad made the choice not him. They can have feelings and so can op. No obligation to the step sibling still.", "A 16-yo and a toddler live very different lives. Unless he makes an effort, they wouldn\u2019t naturally see each other often, I\u2019d think. And if he\u2019s like most 16-yo\u2019s, his priorities are likely elsewhere. He\u2019s at the age to start thinking about a life away from his family, at college or whatever. The age you start to pull away from family a bit to test your own independence. Spending hours a week forcing a bond with a 4-yo wouldn\u2019t sound at all appealing to most 16-yo\u2019s, I\u2019d say.", "I don't see that happening. If anything my dad's wife's idea sounds like the most realistic one. But they might not even be married long term. She's a cheater and this is out of character for my dad, to spring all this on me and expect me to play families with strangers.", "Shit like this got harder to understand when I grew up honestly. Clinging to people you don't know or like because they are assigned \"family\" is like a expressway to unhappiness.", "You do realize that you can treat someone like a stranger and still be kind right.\n It's not that the responses are sociopathic it that more people have a better range of emotions than you can understand. And OP isn't being rotten he just doesn't have to care about others' problems that don't affect him directly. At 16, he has his own problems but nowhere does it state or even hint at that he won't be nice to the child, he just won't see her as a sibling. If you think that's sociopathic, then the you have lived a very sheltered life and have never met a real sociopath.", "OP-PLEASE read this .\nNTA OP.", ">OP's dad and new wife are narcissists\n\nHow long before she cheats again?", "Also raised by a parent with NPD and I agree.  OP you might want to checkout r/raisedbynarcissists", "this is me too. my brother's are 8 and 10 years older. we were just people living in the same house. there is no relationship today.", "Yeah, that's bizarre. I guess they never realized that sibling or step-sibling relationships can take time to develop, be complicated or even nonexistent especially if they just met, for crying out loud.", "Your Dad would probably bite your head off if you said it, but there's no chance this woman is going to remain faithful to him.  Cheaters keep cheating.", "100% you aren\u2019t obligated to be her \u201cbig brother\u201d and should not be expected to do so.  But please don\u2019t go out of your way not to be part of her life.  Be kind to her and don\u2019t take your frustration with your dad and stepmom on her.  You might be the one person in her life that makes a positive impression on her. \n\nP.S. Stand your ground on not being a built in babysitter for her and don\u2019t let them force you into doing things with her, IF you don\u2019t want it. Let it be organic and natural.", ">She just up and left other kids behind?)\n\nIt appears that way... I'm guessing that her other kids flat-out rejected their mom after she'd had multiple affairs while exhibiting her own special brand of selfishness. And apparently she (OP's stepmom) was pretty quick to accept that and move on. Which is pretty hard to fathom.", "Yeah find common ground like OP's new SM is a cheater and a manipulator. Good luck with that.", "I did say NTA, exactly because OP is 16. \n\nBut 16 year olds who ask for advice can be given advice about how to respond more maturely to their problems, can't they?", "Sure. But that doesn't change that the aggressive comeback, while understandable, might not have been the best way for OP to achieve what OP wants to achieve.", "Dad actually never met either of them in person before they moved in. Their whole relationship was over texts, calls and zoom. So he hadn't spent any time with them prior.\n\nWe were close. When he told me what was happening things changed between us. It wasn't that long ago but it was just a lot to expect me to be okay with. I don't consider us all a family. Maybe technically we are. But his wife's idea of me leaving at 18 and not really being around sound way more appealing than us being a family together.", "Try to work so you can save up to move out. They might start using you as a free babysitter", "I see. Any other relatives? I wish the best man but try to get out as fast as you can. Good luck", "Yeah, that doesn\u2019t make her look better.  She had an affair, then when that screwed up her life, she found another guy and abandoned the rest of her kids.  Your dad\u2019s judgment is\u2026questionable.", "Ah okay I was just wondering cause with that situation usually the affair partner is who they end up at least trying to make a go of it with.", "Agree \u2026 basically they said \u201cwe got married, went on our honeymoon & brought you back a 4 year old to take care of! Why don\u2019t you like it?\u201d", "Right! So weird! Let\u2019s sit down, talk to 16 yo son about our adult problems & be pissed off because he has no solutions\u2026. Worst plan ever!", "Yeah she def won\u2019t cheat this time bc he\u2019s gonna treat her right /s", "Plus it seems like it's: \"I didn't leave until I found someone else\".", "\"How dare you make me cheat and birth this child\" like lady, your marriage could have been a nightmare, no one can take that away. But at the end of the day, you are still a cheater.", "If your SO is abusive, why tf would you cheta anyway? Thats just giving them a reason to be worse", "I'm sure that's very likely.  I'm glad that you seem to have a good head on your shoulders and are able to see this without too much emotion skewing your perception.

Totally this, though, more kidneys or bone marrow... I am not as well versed in liver donations.", "You know, spending time with her, building a relationship, etc. It takes a lot of hours to do this, hours the new couple has to themselves without a toddler around. I assume they want OP to love and care for his father's wife's daughter by taking her places and hanging out all the time. That's really all a teenager ever wants to do, spend a lot of time with a strange toddler. /s", "Part of me wonders if the main reason why she married OP\u2019s dad was so she could give her kid a sibling that wouldn\u2019t hate her. Yet now she\u2019s active making OP indifferent to the kid by trying to force them into being a big sibling to a kid they don\u2019t even know or care about.", "Saying it's an honor to be a big brother, which is what every parent says when introducing a new sibling, is not the same thing as saying they expect him to worship her. They just asked him to make an effort.\n\nUsually, being a big sibling is considered an honor because you have a kid who will look up to you and worship *you*. This is not necessarily what will happen, but absolutely nothing will happen without OP making an effort.

Either you haven't been a 16yo yet or you were extremely isolated, because 16yos generally have a lot of friends and activities with kids their own age. 16yos are generally never at home except to eat and sleep, at least where I am they are.

You think being 16 exempts someone from likening people? \n\n... that is not what is being said at all. Maybe read the posts that you keep replying to instead of precomposing your projection-driven replies in your head?\n\nMost teens have social lives that take place outside of the house.\n\nHow many teenager do you know who want to spend their vibrant teen years getting to know a toddler?", "Well, I think that is very sad. I guess we are different in that way.", "And those kids do not want to play with 4 year olds get real . They have their own interests even if it isn\u2019t being social. Still will  doubtful they are thinking wow I wish I had a 4 year old to play with", "I had literally no social life at all as a teen and I still would have scratched my fucking eyes out before spending an afternoon 'building a relationship' with a rando toddler.\n\nIf this kid was wired to like toddlers and little kids enough to take on this new sibling vibe, they'd not need pressuring into it by deluded adults playing happy houses.\n\nI wonder how long before the missus wandering eye starts to wander again."]}
