I (53f) was married to my husband (44m) for 12 years. We each had children from previous marriages and we had a son together. Things were tough and we struggled a lot but we always leaned on each other and got through. We moved far from my family and things got better. Then the unthinkable happened. Our son passed away from a household accident (I was not present but husband saw the whole thing.) in 2021. It was the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced and I don\u2019t wish it on anyone. Even him. I sought counseling but he didn\u2019t. Then as I thought we were getting our lives together he told me he was moving out. No warning. I was devastated, crying as I type this, he told me 6 months to the day of our son\u2019s death and he was gone in 3 days. The worst 3 days of my life since losing our son. I went through the pain of loss all over again. Once leaving he said he would \u201chelp out\u201d with the bills in his name. He left his dog with me and I struggled to keep my pet family with me but when our landlord told me he\u2019s selling I was homeless. All of which he knew (small town) and did nothing. I had to make some tough choices to survive and I had to put my dog down, cancer. Now I was alone, struggling. A friend offered a place to stay but it meant taking my remaining pets to the pound. I was wrecked again. Recently our divorce became final and I only got $5000 to pay off $40000 of debt ,he told the judge of every penny he \u201chelped out\u201d with and it went in his favor. That was in April. He hasn\u2019t made a payment yet. I\u2019m in a bad spot and could really use that money. He ,and his new dog, got a great job in another state and we don\u2019t contact each other. Friends say I should let it go and move on without his help but I\u2019m lost. So am I the ah if I take him back to court?", "created_utc": 1686320008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1456dxz/aita_for_taking_legal_action_against_my_ex_after/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely NTA for taking him back to court but have you consulted a lawyer to see if you\u2019d actually be able to get more money or anything else?

The only thing I would say is that if you are talking about court proceedings, it's pretty irrelevant whether he, or you, is the AH.

He owes you money and he hasn't paid.  Take him to court for $5,000 + court costs + interest.  \n\nI'm with your friends on the \"move on\" part - do what you can to move forward and better your situation as best you can.  Get creative if need be.  But DON'T just let it go.  5k might not be life changing, but it's a good amount that, most importantly, he was court mandated to pay in the first place.", "NTA  \nIf he hasn't paid you, get a lawyer and take him back to court. When you get the judgement, you can either choose to get the court to force payment, or, at least in my state, you can put a lien against him and his assets, accruing at 12% interest. And then either sit on it for awhile or foreclose. I've a friend who did exactly that and it was beautiful to behold.\n\nI'm so sorry that you've been through this and hope that you can find some peace.", "If your divorce is final and there's a decree of what he needs to pay, that court (probably a probate court, if you're in US) has jurisdiction to enforce its order (and assess additional fees and penalties/hold him in contempt, etc.). You don't start all over in a different court. \n\nNTA and talk to your divorce lawyer.", "Can\u2019t afford one. This is the cheapest option. It would be small claims court.", "Yeah honestly that's the big thing. She would have to show that the dude mislead the court when they decided everything.\n\nAnd going thru small claims court is going to take years. If it even gets that far. Serving the guy alone is going to be a nightmare if he ever gets word that she is thinking about suing him.\n\nOp's biggest mistake was not getting his \"I'll help you out\" in writing. It's going to bite her in the ass.", "Haven\u2019t consulted with a lawyer yet. I\u2019m broke. Just thinking small claims court.", "I\u2019m not asking for more than what was awarded originally. I agreed he could pay it off monthly but he hasn\u2019t even tried. He knows my situation and how to pay he just chooses not to. If we go to court I could only afford the small fee for small claims. I\u2019m not trying to get more.", "Depending where you live, a lot of lawyers will, if you call and ask, will give you an amount of their time free to ask questions about stuff like this, especially to women suddenly saddled with debt because of a divorce, I had one friend go to several such lawyers, each time asking different questions so she could decide what you wanted to do.  Also, if you go online and search 'free legal advice' you can find law offices who will do much the same thing from comfort of your home.", "Oh I think I initially misread. He hasn\u2019t even paid the $5k he was ordered to pay yet. I thought she was tryna get more money on top of the $5k.", "I think the small claims for him to pay what he\u2019s already been ordered to pay is good, they might hit him with some punitive damages too which would be nice.", "Go git em! He needs to fulfill that obligation.", "Make sure you know what you\u2019re doing. My best guess is to file and take it back to the initial court\u2026 you need a consultation with an attorney!", "If you're trying to get a judgement enforced, I don't think small claims court will work. Small claims are for relatively small stand-alone issues. This is the settlement from a previous case, I don't think you'll be able to get this heard in small claims.\n\nDid you not have a lawyer for your divorce?\n\nNot a lawyer, but some states will enforce divorce settlements through the same judge that oversaw the initial divorce and other states have a different process.\n\nTalk to your lawyer if you had one and that lawyer will know how to get the judgement enforced.", "Thank you. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. This is what I needed to hear.", "Yeah honestly it's kind of confusing too. I think the OP g0t $5,000 from him to pay off the $40,000 debt. Which might be what she needs to cover in the divorce?", "maybe google \"legal aid\" and inquire at local law schools about free clinics for the community", "When I reread it it sounds like she was awarded $5k and also given $40k in marital debt and he\u2019s on a payment plan for the $5k, but he hasn\u2019t given her any money yet?", "Not the AH for seeking to get what was court ordered to be paid to you."]}
