{"id": 18620, "submission_id": "13wimfm", "title": "WIBTA If I (F17) spoke to my dad about cutting my hair and going to Crossfit?", "selftext": "I am 17 and my mum won't let me get a haircut or go to Crossfit because I am a woman.\n\nMy mum is Christian, conservative and very traditional. My dad is conservative and kinda traditional. My mum became Christian when I was 14 and her whole personality and opinions on everything changed.\n\nI got a pixie cut when I was 12 and have only gotten it trimmed twice since then. It now reaches my waist and I want it cut to my shoulders. Last year I asked and was told no. I fought over it a bit but gave up. Recently I brought it up again. Mum is acting like it is sudden andI am rebelling. She told me to let her talk to dad. I did and he thinks it's fine. She won't listen and says it is a sin and I will look ugly and not feminine. \"Men are attracted to women with long hair\".\n\nWhen I was 14 I did Crossfit for a few months and loved it. I don't have any extra curricular activities so I wanted to do it again. When I told my mum she said no. She thinks I will end up big, bulky, masculine and ugly. Another form of \"rebellion\". I am aiming to loose fat and gain muscle, I will end up thinner. Another reason is that there are men there. Her solution is for my skinny, nerdy 13 y/o brother to chaperone me. \n\nMy dad said he is fine with me cutting my hair and he is happy to pay $35 a week for unlimited Crossfit classes. Mum won't listen though and dad doesn't want to argue with her so he doesn't push the issue.\n\nIf I try to talk to my dad about topicd my mum and I disagree on even if just to get his opinion she will be mad. She has asked me before if I want to cause problems in their marriage. Told me that it's disobedience and therefore sin.\n\nSo, WIBTA and a homewrecker if I had a serious discussion with my dad about how I want my mum to ease up a little? I feel suffocated and frustrated but I seriously don't want to cause problems! My family matters to me and I would feel forever guilty if I did!!\n\nEdit: For those that say to wait till I'm 18, it won't change anything. I am not allowed to move out until marriage and don't have the money because I am not allowed a job. I also won't be able to buy a car and we live too far from anything to walk. My parents won't buy me a car either. I am homeschooled so there isn't anyone that I can reach out to outside of my immediate family.\n\nEdit 2: This definitely went in an unexpected direction... Tbh the idea of leaving scares me and although I desperately want the freedom that would come with it, I'm not even sure if that would help or make things worse. If I left without permission my mum might stop my brothers from talking to me and I love them so much I can't imagine it.

You\u2019re 17 years old - definitely old enough to make your own decisions about haircuts and exercise classes. If you speaking to your dad about a haircut is going to wreck your parents\u2019 marriage, then they\u2019re doomed for divorce anyway. You\u2019re not causing problems - you\u2019re asking for perfectly reasonable, age-appropriate things.", "Forget about the whole \"you're not allowed\" thing. It only works as long as you want. Go get your haircut and go get a part time job somewhere. What is she gonna do? Chain you in the basement? You need to get out of that household, your mother is an abuser and your father is an enabler, you need to escape. You're allowed to move out whenever you want. It's only her word stopping you and her word isn't worth shit. Go ask your dad if he loves you, if he says yes then ask him why is he allowing that.", "No, NTA whatsoever. But be prepared for your dad to not back you up, seems like he has no spine to stand up to your mom. \n\nIf I were you, id just go to a salon and get my hair cut. As far as I know you dont need a premission slip from your parents to do that.", "NTA. But I\u2019m very worried about you. If you\u2019re not allowed to work till you get married, then how long do you think it will be till they\u2019re pressuring you to get married. Then what? You\u2019ll be expected to be a stay at home wife and be trapped in another prison?\n\nI think you need to understand that what your parents are doing is abusive. Social isolation, limiting the potential to earn money and limiting bodily autonomy are all classic abusive tactics. And my concern is they are planning on handing you off to someone who will use the same tactics against you. \n\nYou are in an abusive family dynamic. Try to quietly find out where your documents are and hide them somewhere safe. On your 18th birthday, find information on a woman\u2019s shelter and get out. Once you have become established in a job and living situation, you can always re-establish contact with your family, but your priority needs to be to escape.", "NTA, but be ready for your mom to lose her shit on y\u2019all.\n\nI dealt with similar from my mom at your age, ended up going through with the haircut and shit anyway and she wouldn\u2019t talk to me for days. Regardless, you deserve to be able to exist in your house without being shamed for..a fucking haircut and exercising. I\u2019d go for it, do what makes you happy", "NTA. Nothing you are asking is even close to rebellion and imo, there's already problems in the marriage if your dad has no energy to have even a discussion with your mother about things. \n\nYou can have that serious talk with your dad, it probably won't go anywhere, but it will be good for you to get your point across. \n\nNo matter what you or your dad do, if it's against your mum's ideals then it sounds like it's going to cause tension between them as a couple. But that's not really your responsibility. You're their 17 year old daughter, not their court appointed mediator. \n\nAlso she wants to be spouting on about your disobedience being a sin but she won't submit to her husband...... hypocritical much?", "NTA and mom found a great way to push herself out of your circle of trust.\nEdit: your edit sounds very sad, it's almost like you're imprisoned. Wish you luck!", "NTA it\u2019s not your job to protect your parents from each other at your own expense. Your mother\u2019s views are extreme and they are negatively affecting you; you are a minor in her care and have no recourse except to appeal to other adults for help. If your mother and father don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on religion or parenting or how God feels about CrossFit that\u2019s something they need to address between themselves, not something you need to tiptoe around to prevent them from ever coming into conflict. Your mother trying to impose that responsibility on you is a way of avoiding accepting it for herself: she\u2019s not willing to do the work to have healthy relationships, so she\u2019s going to use the guilt and fear of harming them to control you. It\u2019s messed up.\n\nI\u2019m also annoyed that her views are so glaringly inconsistent. She doesn\u2019t want you to have short hair or muscles because men don\u2019t like them, but she also doesn\u2019t want you unchaperoned around men\u2014which is it? If she doesn\u2019t want you receiving male attention, wouldn\u2019t cutting your hair and getting fit (in her mind) solve that problem on its own? She\u2019s telling you that you must be able to attract as many men as possible at all times but also never be in a situation in which you might accidentally attract men and I hate that for you. \n\nBy all means talk to your dad about how stupid, contradictory, controlling, and off-putting all of this is\u2014maybe bring it up with a guidance counselor, as well?\u2014and make a plan to get independent from your parents (I know your dad is \u201cbetter\u201d but he\u2019s still choosing to be married to your mom, so you can\u2019t count on him) as soon as you\u2019re legally able.\n\nAnd last thing, because you didn\u2019t ask but it\u2019s a common misconception: women do not \u201cbulk up\u201d the second they look at a pair of dumbbells. Women\u2019s bodies do not add muscle easily and they don\u2019t do it on autopilot. That bodybuilder look you see sometimes\u2014the women who achieve that do it very intentionally, with a *ton* of work and a very deliberate training plan and, often, the help of supplements. It\u2019s not something many people can do at all; it\u2019s certainly not going to happen to you by accident.", "Oh boy, you got to love Christian fanatics.", "NTA. This is a very unhealthy situation. \"Born again\" Christians are the most overzealous on a good day but it sounds like your mama has found herself on the more \"cult\" side of the faith. Based on your comments it seems like she is going so far as to isolate you as well as control everything you do. I wouldn't be shocked if she was planning on making you a match too.\n\nNow to the nitty gritty, once you are 18 there is no \"letting\" you do anything. You can take all important documents (ids, birth certificate, ect) some cash, hop on a bus to a women's shelter or something like it. It will be hard and it will suck, but it is an option. Once you are a legal adult there isn't much your mom can do. However, I realize it is easy to say that but harder to live it. I don't know how you feel about your family but they may be hard to leave for emotional reasons too. Is there any extended family that can lend a hand? That is another option if so. You clearly have access to the internet so finding online support groups is also another option. Talking with people who have been in your shoes may help.", "NTA, spend the next months gathering all your important documents and hiding them in a safe place. Next, prepare a get out bag, keep it hidden (under bed or top closet shelf), and any money you can get your hands on keep hidden. When you turn 18 (maybe even literally at midnight), leave and don't tell anyone where you are going even if you have to walk. Take yourself to a women's shelter and get yourself together. Yes, it will be hard but worth it in the long run. In the meantime, you could try hopping on to narcissistic parents' reddit sub. It's really supportive and could maybe give you more specific leads to help in your area. Until then, keep strong. You are better than your circumstances.", "NTA. \n\n>My mum became Christian when I was 14 and her whole personality and opinions on everything changed.\n\nYour mother shouldn't be putting her views onto you, when she decided to change and become Christine. You were old enough to decide if you wanted to be like that or not. Your mother needs a talking to, especially abt your feelings and trapped you feel with her decisions. \n\nGo talk to your dad, and hope something can be resolved.", "NTA. You need to talk to him. I won't go into any of the details, but there is so much that's wrong here and I would even describe some of it as disturbing.", "NTA it's 2023 not 1923... Get your groove on.", "Nta.\n\nYou can only ask, but your dad will probably say no.\n\nYou are in Australia based on your comment. So am I. Your mother cannot force any of the views she has on you after your 18th birthday. \n\nThere are social services to help you get away from this, if that is what you want. Don't settle for your parents' plan for you. If you want to be educated, get a degree or certification, or make your own life plans, make an exit plan. \n\nYou want to cut your hair and do crossfit? Do it, but wait until you're 18.", "NTA, and jesus it sounds like you're in a massively abusive household. You should not feel guilty about wanting some human rights for yourself. You should really work on finding a way to get out of there as fast as possible. Is there no goverment help or some association you could reach to? There has to be ways to get out of there.", "Is this\u2026 real? Jesus this is a toxic situation to be in. NTA, I\u2019m sure there are several ways out but one you can try to do is join the military, the recruiters are so desperate they\u2019ll pick you up to do everything. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy or maybe the best decision for you, but it\u2019s one way out of your house once your 18 we get these stories a lot.", "NTA. If your father supports you, than definitely talk to him. It is not automatically a sin to disagree with your mother, she is not god, she is also a person. Do you go to church with your family? Do you have someone there you can trust? Cutting off hair sounds a bit extreme. Also, it sounds like your mother believes it is a sin to look less feminine/less desirable but isn't that tempting the men and also a sin if you are ultra conservative?", "After you are 18, just move out.", "You can't cut your hair because you need to be attractive to men, but you can't be around men because they might be attracted to you?", "NTA but we both know the haircut and CrossFit is not the problem here duckling.\n\n[https://childhelphotline.org/](https://www.childhelp.org/) \\- I'm not sure if this will work for you but as soon as you are sure you won't be heard try talking to someone from here.

Your parents cannot force you to live with them until you are married.  Your mother is controlling your entire life.  When you turn 18 (19 in some states) you will be considered an adult and can do as you please.  Heck, if you went to the salon and got your hair cut what exactly would happen?  She's be pissed?

Sorry for the long upcoming rant...\n\nIm scared your mother will give you away to the first willing man once you turn 18. Ive heard horror stories about parents like that forcing their daughters to marry men much older than them, simply so that they will go from the parents control to the husbands control, giving the parents grandkids and filling whatever role they seem fit for their kid.\n\nThe way it looks right now, you're isolated. And its very likely your mother knows this and is using this. She controls what you do and how you look. She cannot force you to stay with her but it seems she's been working on making you believe so.\n\nStart to find your important documents. Start looking online for possible safe places for women to stay or anything like that (be sure to hide the history/evidence). When you're 18, try to get out. I understand it sounds terrifying but I am genuinely scared your mom plans on making you marry whoever she sees fit so that you will fill whatever role she wants, and have kids, giving her grandkids.\n\nImagine this. Your mom finds a man she wants you to live with and marry. Theres a high risk you'll go from one abuser to another if this happens. She'll probably decide your future partner. You marry and have his kids around 18-20 years old possibly. You're a stay at home mom (which is an okay thing to want to be) but this most likely means he will earn the money. And he can use that to isolate you further and control you. You're forced to stay at home and care for the kids, not allowed a social life. He is your only support system. Your mom gets what she wants, a \"perfect obedient daughter\" that gives her grandkids. There's also a high risk your husband will be physically abusive if he is emotionally. This isn't a new situation, this is far too common.\n\nThe best thing you can do is find a way out to gain independence. Live your own life, find your own friends, your own husband! One that will possibly let you be a SAHM but still love and care for you and treat you well! Just please remember that you are still young. Even if you find someone you believe is the one, don't jump into having kids or anything. Im guessing how controlling your mom is, you haven't had a relationship before? At least not a serious one? Take your time, learn how to live, learn how to see what people are good and what people aren't. It can be easy for those who have escaped abuse to fall into another abusive situation because its so familiar to them. \n\nPlease be safe", "NTA and why I hold nothing but contempt for religion.
