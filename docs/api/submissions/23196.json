So I had a small update and thought I'd share with you.\n\nSo since this happened, there was no contact between us. She video called me last evening and I picked up. I said \"hey\" and she instead of replying turned her video camera to her dog. For the next 2-3 mins, she showed me how Jeffy can obey every command that she gives and that's he's super smart and obedient. In all fairness, he did obey 85% of the commands in one go.\n\nThen she turned her video to herself and told me that how wrong I was about her dog and that she was very mad that I didn't help her when i could. I still said the same points which I did the other day, that I am not experienced enough to walk him without a leash, the dangers to him and the public etc. I also told her that a lot of people agree with me on that.\n\nHer reply was that they don't know her dog and neither do i. If I'm not experienced enough, i should've just listened to her and done what she said.\n\nThen i got pretty mad and said that if I'm inexperienced, HOW did she expect me to do something so dangerous? Just cuz her dog obeyed her and her family, doesn't mean he'd obey me. Not only was she trying to put Jeffy in danger, but also people on the road and also maybe me. \n\nThen she again went on the whole \"it's abuse\" tangent. I told her that leashes are infact not abusive. Then she said maybe not for other dogs, but Jeffy has been without a leash since forever and for him it's be restrictive and abusive. Then she said that I don't really care about her dog and she didn't need a friend who wouldn't show up when she needed them. \n\nI in turn said that she's being VERY negligent and obtuse about the whole thing. Some ppl would say I care more about her dog than she does. And that she should look into the benefits of a leash. And that she wasn't being a very good dog owner nor a good citizen. And I also called her out on calling me a bitch for refusing, to which she said \"then don't act like one\".\n\nI called her a bad dog owner and said I prayed that her stupidity doesn't lead to drastic consequences for the poor beautiful baby or anyone else and cut the call.\n\nSafe to say, that friendship is ended. I'd miss the beautiful golden boy tho, I did love him a good bit, and I'd pray that he remains safe and sound and goofy despite his stupid owner.", "created_utc": 1690387893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aa0qo/update_aita_for_refusing_to_walk_my_friends_dog/", "score": 658, "replies": ["Wow. She is an idiot. Good for you for wanting to keep her dog safe. Hope nothing bad happens to her fur baby because of her negligence.

One got spooked by a car and ran into traffic and was hit....the other dog got spooked by fireworks on 4th of July and was never found.... Doesn't matter how well trained your animal is, accidents can happen, and it was really messed up she didn't take your concerns seriously. I hope nothing bad happened to Jeffy.", "She sounds unhinged.

But we do have SO many stray dogs. The ones in my locality are my friends tho, haha. I feed them dinner and they follow me around the locality whenever i step out. Beautiful kids", "It's a recipe for disaster for sure. I hope she's right about it tho", "Ugh, I can't STAND dog owners like her. Even in the comfort and control of her own home the dog only obeyed 85% of commands, there's no way he won't get distracted on a busy street at night.\n\nSooner or later she's going to find out how wrong she is, and I can only pray for the dog's sake that it's a scare and not a tragedy that does it.", "She is controlling. Even if she disagreed with you, she should have still respected your position. Good job for standing up to her. She will be back but don\u2019t fall for it (Or she will find a \u201cfriend\u201d she can control).", "You did the right thing!  Poor Jeffy!  Sorry your ex-\"friend\" called you a bitch.  She sounds awful on so many levels!", "Honestly I would have hung up the call and blocked her the moment she turned it on the dog. Just because the dog follows her/her family's commands (you know, the people who live with the dog and trained the dog) does not mean the dog will follow other people's commands or be as well behaved around other people without family there, no matter how well the dog knows them.\n\nIt's great that the dog is well trained, but the safety of the dogs yard and the unpredictability of the street/park are vastly different situations.\n\nSounds like you won the jackpot having the friendship end. She sounds like an exhausting person.", "She\u2019s an idiot and her poor dog will likely pay the price.  Not even champion obedience dogs are 100% reliable all the time.  They\u2019re living beings, not robots, and if something interesting enough catches his attention, he\u2019s absolutely capable of blowing off your friend\u2019s commands and dashing into traffic after it.", "Service dogs (real ones) are highly trained. They're also ALWAYS on a leash.  Police dogs, also trained, also leashed. The only dogs not on a leash are working farm dogs (or maybe fru-fru purse dogs). It's just safer for the dog. Too bad the one who really cares for Jeffy is you.", "Her demand that you walk the dog without a leash is crazy to me.", "Send her these threads", "He immediately obeyed ONLY 85% of commands--by his owner, in his home, without new distractions!? \n\nOh, yes, what a very disciplined and well trained dog! /s", "So you're in a place where feral dogs are common and she still doesn't want to leash her pet? Forget Jeffy causing a problem, he's likely to get mauled.", "People who go leashless infuriate me. I have a service dog and all it would take is one bad interaction and he\u2019d be retired or worse. Not just that, a leash is a way to help pull a dog back from danger- like a car that didn\u2019t see him or another animal about to lunge. \n\nThe fucked up logic that Friend used is boggling. And you called her out on the one that got me- that you don\u2019t know dogs, so should therefore take the dog out. No, if you don\u2019t know dogs, you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for one! \n\nAnd if she\u2019s worried that a leash is \u201cabusive\u201d because he can\u2019t roam, then get a longer leash. Though I hate those leashes that do the extension thing- they aren\u2019t safe, people don\u2019t think to limit the length when around others or obstacles, and that extra second it takes to click the leash to stationary could be the difference between saving the dog and not. \n\nNow, my service dog stays off leash in my store, because a leash would limit his ability to do his job. I require all others to be leashed in part to keep him safe. But that and in private homes are the only places, for his safety. Your friend is an idiot and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not a friend anymore. Maybe there\u2019s a shelter nearby that you can volunteer at to get the puppy love time instead?", "Yeah, your former friend is an idiot.", "She is stupid. Her dog is trained when SHE gives the commands. That might not extend to you. You were on the dot in everything you said. What an asshole.", "I'm sorry your former friend valued you so little.", "Restrictive does not equal abusive.\n\nA seatbelt can be restrictive but it can also save your life, just like a leash.\n\nAnd just like a leash, no sane person is going call wearing a seatbelt abusive.\n\nYou made the right call OP", "My neighbor's across the street from us let their small breed dog out into their yard unleashed all the times. I knew one day this dog was going to get killed, and one day it finally happened. It ran out into the street to bark in the face of a dog being walked on my side and got ran over.", "You absolutely did the right thing. The very fact that she felt that the leash would \"prevent him from exploring\" means... he randomly runs around. Which means, that he is uncontrolled, and ***needs to be on a leash***.", "Dog culture has gotten horrendous lately, on a worldwide scale, & it\u2019s always at the expense of the dogs. Good on you for not giving in to her negligence.", "My dog is very well trained. I could walk him without a leash, but that would be fucking moronic. There are so many external factors that they are not taking into consideration. NTA", "NTA.\n\nBoy, she really couldn't let it go, could she? Someone actually had the nerve to challenge her on her dog and his behavior and the ever-abusive leash, etc.\n\nI remember your first post; I replied to it, because she was so wrong and entitled and above all relentlessly not listening to anything you said that it irritated me and I needed to speak.\n\nAnd here she is again, ed ella batte sullo stesso chiodo (Italian: She's banging away on the same nail). And she's still wrong and entitled and relentless.\n\nYou're so much better off not knowing her.", "I had a friend who lived in Brazil with a large population of street dogs and she mentioned that aggressive dogs don't last long in her village. Sigh.\n\nBut, I agree, if there are strays, it is even more important to keep the dog close - especially if you're not one of \"his\" people he is used to obeying.", "Agreed! My friends (up until 2 years ago) had this Great Dane-sized dog. The only outside place she could run around unleashed was their fenced-in backyard. When they were living in apartments, if she went outside, she was on a leash. Leash ordinances aside, leashing your dog is the smart thing for the dog, the general public, and you.", "Your still NTA, I dog sit my sisters dog and he is impeccably trained, obeys commands everytime even for his non favourite humans, he is the definition of a very good boy. But I still will use a lead on our walks, why ? because he's not my dog and though I trust his training, I'm not willing to take the risk and responsibility that the one occasion he might do something unpredictable, is when he's with me and I would never forgive myself if he got hurt in my care.", "Wow still NTA... there are so many places here in Australia that mandate your dog be on a leash at all times in a public place for everyones safety, including the dogs.\n\nI've had the misfortunate of hitting a dog that had gotten out of the yard and run to freedom.  That poor jack russel came out of no where, and wasn't wearing a collar, I asked around but none of the neighbours knew who's dog it was that had just run under my car.", "There are plenty of dogs at the park who will let you love them.  Ignore this person and her dog in the future.  NTAH.", "This is starting to sound quite elaborate for an argument about a single dog walking incident.", "Congrats on losing someone worth not knowing.", "Poor babies :///////\nI hope it doesn't happen to Jeffy. But it doesn't seem like her views on this are gonna change", "A leash is important, anyone who says otherwise like OP's ex friend is stupid. I've read news of unleashed dogs that died because they were spooked and ran on the roads. The worst part is always the owners claiming that the dog \"never did this before\" like wtf.", "Nah, I'm done. We weren't very close ever, so don't care as much. I'll just miss the dog tho.", "Yeah, we've never been veryyy close either ways. I'd never seen this side of her. Good riddance tbvh.", "Lol I would but I'm blocked now", "I think so too. Thank you!!! \nI was unsure when I'd made the og post, but after all the replies to it, I'm pretty sure I made the right call", "I even noted some of them to her. But she won't take any into account :)))))", "After how she reacted... I agree w you. I don't need that shit in my life. Especially when I know I'm right", "Exactly! I didn't want to take that responsibility. I'd die of guilt if something happento him on my watch but she wouldn't get it", "Oh man, that sucks. :////\nI told her this could happen but yeah", "There are fortunately. We have a lot of stray dogs where I come from, and they're very very loving!", "It's more than that for her ig. She went on to how \"I didn't help a friend in need (her)\" and how I would willing abuse her dog by putting it on a leash", "You're not wrong about it. We have 10+ strays in my locality. And while they're very sweet, they go wild of another dog enters their territory.", "I didn't even think of this initially. Stray dogs are so common in our place, idk how she's been walking him without a leash ??????", "My mum used to walk our 2 childhood dogs without a leash because they were old and slow and our house backed on to a reserve with a trail so there wasn't much for them to go to (granted she would always have 2 leashes on her just in case she needed it). \n\nAnyway they built a fairly busy road quite close to the path and one time, still don't know why, but these 2 old dogs both start SPRINTING (highly unusual for them) in opposite directions. Mum manages to grab one but can't find the other until she hears lots of honking and stuff, he was standing in the middle of the busy road causing all the cars to stop and honk while she ran to get him.\n\nThankfully he was totally fine just a little shaken but she learnt that now that the road was built they had to be leashed all the time.", "She\u2019s really pissed about that shit on the carpet, huh? Don\u2019t worry about this entitled nutjob.", "If the dog is as well-trained as she claims, he would neither notice nor care that he was on a leash.", "Nah fr you are so correct. I walked dogs for years and rarely were off leash dogs good enough; they always would approach. I specialized in large unfriendly breeds. If one was approached, a conflict would erupt. If i was walking even the best boy off leash, in the case of another dog attacking i have no way to quickly get to the heart of the conflict to physically separate. \nIt\u2019s for everyones protection.", "Aren\u2019t goldens generally dumb and distracted by everything? Like they aren\u2019t aggressive or anything, but they aren\u2019t that smart either.", "And to think that she WALKS him on a busy road", "Yeah, I'm not. We weren't that close anyway. And I won't miss her especially after she called me a bitch for being 100% right", "Yup, they're the dog you think of when you hear the joke of a dog getting distracted by a squirrel. Something mildly interesting or new popping up on that street path is gonna show OP's ex-friend real quick how dumb her no-leash policy is (again, hopefully not in a way that ends in tragedy).", "In Seattle, you can be ticketed for having your dog off leash anywhere but an off leash park. It's for everyone's safety. If another dog is aggressive, you can pull yours back. Same with aggressive children. If they get spooked, they can't take off running. It's just common sense.\n\nThanks for the update. I'm sorry she's TA.", "It's my dream to get a dog I could train so well they could be off-leash and still listen to me, but I honestly would only do it in forests and more remote places.\n\nIn a town, walking on sidewalk, how much \"freedom to explore\" does a dog need anyway? If her dog stays next to her, what difference does it make if he's wearing a leash once in a while. \nAnd even if he's well behaved and goldens are generally aloof and easy to train, they are still dogs and hey, retrievers deep down. Anything could happen. Having the dog on a leash just in case might save his life.\n\nIf I were in her shoes I would insist on using a leash. You can't read his body language that might inform he needs a command reinforced and stuff like that, that she might do unconsciously.", "That is an excellent, excellent point.", "Even farm dogs often have a fence where they are when unsupervised. Especially livestock guardian dogs, as they might decide to expand their territory on their own. Also more safe for visitors when the dogs are behind a fence.", "Good for your for standing your ground on this.  Just because her dog obeys her, doen not mean he will obey you.  You are not the Alpha to her dog, she is.  so of course the bog will obey her.\n\nAnd if you did go ahead and take to the for a walk and it got lost or injured or unlived, she would be blaming you.  You dont need her friendship", "Add to the 85%, he'll be walking with someone he's never walked with before.  At least not solo.  So now the dog is in an unfamiliar situation on top of not being 100% obedient to his actual owner.", "Thankfully the only times off-leash dogs approached me they were friendly (so was mine), but they very much did not listen to their owner. One time it was two small dogs with their owner running after them and actually screaming for them to come back.", "If a leash restricts his ability to \u2018explore\u2019 then he\u2019s exploring too much to be off leash.", "Sooo...this immaculately trained dog obeyed 85% of her commands on the first go?  With his primary trainer?  Inside with no distractions?  So, under those ideal conditions, he DIDN'T immediately obey commands 15% of the time?  That's a HUGE error rate when the dog's unrestrained beside a busy road.\n\nYou were smart to refuse that responsibility.  Your (former) friend is TA and an idiot.", "Still NTA and wait til she comes across somewhere where there are leash laws (some districts and areas) and she gets a fine for not having him on a leash. She's being purposefully ignorant.", "Not sure where you're located but here it's the law to have your dog on a leash.", "I can't tell you how many times my dog has gotten attacked by an offleash \"well behaved\" dog who's \"never done something like this\""]}
