So I had a small update and thought I'd share with you.\n\nSo since this happened, there was no contact between us. She video called me last evening and I picked up. I said \"hey\" and she instead of replying turned her video camera to her dog. For the next 2-3 mins, she showed me how Jeffy can obey every command that she gives and that's he's super smart and obedient. In all fairness, he did obey 85% of the commands in one go.\n\nThen she turned her video to herself and told me that how wrong I was about her dog and that she was very mad that I didn't help her when i could. I still said the same points which I did the other day, that I am not experienced enough to walk him without a leash, the dangers to him and the public etc. I also told her that a lot of people agree with me on that.\n\nHer reply was that they don't know her dog and neither do i. If I'm not experienced enough, i should've just listened to her and done what she said.\n\nThen i got pretty mad and said that if I'm inexperienced, HOW did she expect me to do something so dangerous? Just cuz her dog obeyed her and her family, doesn't mean he'd obey me. Not only was she trying to put Jeffy in danger, but also people on the road and also maybe me. \n\nThen she again went on the whole \"it's abuse\" tangent. I told her that leashes are infact not abusive. Then she said maybe not for other dogs, but Jeffy has been without a leash since forever and for him it's be restrictive and abusive. Then she said that I don't really care about her dog and she didn't need a friend who wouldn't show up when she needed them. \n\nI in turn said that she's being VERY negligent and obtuse about the whole thing. Some ppl would say I care more about her dog than she does. And that she should look into the benefits of a leash. And that she wasn't being a very good dog owner nor a good citizen. And I also called her out on calling me a bitch for refusing, to which she said \"then don't act like one\".\n\nI called her a bad dog owner and said I prayed that her stupidity doesn't lead to drastic consequences for the poor beautiful baby or anyone else and cut the call.\n\nSafe to say, that friendship is ended. I'd miss the beautiful golden boy tho, I did love him a good bit, and I'd pray that he remains safe and sound and goofy despite his stupid owner.", "created_utc": 1690387893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aa0qo/update_aita_for_refusing_to_walk_my_friends_dog/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Wow. She is an idiot. Good for you for wanting to keep her dog safe. Hope nothing bad happens to her fur baby because of her negligence. Are there volunteer opportunities for you to help other dogs like shelters where you live? Good riddance to her.", "Well, hopefully he doesn't bite anyone while off leash and get destroyed.", "Nta \n\nI lost a friend for a similar thing.. guess what happened to her dogs? One got spooked by a car and ran into traffic and was hit....the other dog got spooked by fireworks on 4th of July and was never found.... Doesn't matter how well trained your animal is, accidents can happen, and it was really messed up she didn't take your concerns seriously. I hope nothing bad happened to Jeffy.", "She sounds unhinged. I think the dog would've been better off with someone like you.", "She's going to be an insufferable mother and raise a nightmare child.", "\nIt looks like you're trying to post an update to your AITA post.\n\n#Read our update guidelines [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_can_i_post_an_update_on_my_thread.3F)\n\nIf your post meets the outlined guidelines, please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/amitheasshole&subject=Update+Request) for approval.

Let's see if she's still whining about how leash laws don't apply to her dog when she's paying for hospital bills, skin grafts, and attorney fees.  \n\nYou absolutely made the right decision.", "Thoughts and prayers for Jeffy", "Unfortunately, where I come from, we don't have as many shelters. But we do have SO many stray dogs. The ones in my locality are my friends tho, haha. I feed them dinner and they follow me around the locality whenever i step out. Beautiful kids", "It's a recipe for disaster for sure. I hope she's right about it tho", "Ugh, I can't STAND dog owners like her. Even in the comfort and control of her own home the dog only obeyed 85% of commands, there's no way he won't get distracted on a busy street at night.\n\nSooner or later she's going to find out how wrong she is, and I can only pray for the dog's sake that it's a scare and not a tragedy that does it.", "She is controlling. Even if she disagreed with you, she should have still respected your position. Good job for standing up to her. She will be back but don\u2019t fall for it (Or she will find a \u201cfriend\u201d she can control).", "You did the right thing!  Poor Jeffy!  Sorry your ex-\"friend\" called you a bitch.  She sounds awful on so many levels!", "Honestly I would have hung up the call and blocked her the moment she turned it on the dog. Just because the dog follows her/her family's commands (you know, the people who live with the dog and trained the dog) does not mean the dog will follow other people's commands or be as well behaved around other people without family there, no matter how well the dog knows them.\n\nIt's great that the dog is well trained, but the safety of the dogs yard and the unpredictability of the street/park are vastly different situations.\n\nSounds like you won the jackpot having the friendship end. She sounds like an exhausting person.", "She\u2019s an idiot and her poor dog will likely pay the price.  Not even champion obedience dogs are 100% reliable all the time.  They\u2019re living beings, not robots, and if something interesting enough catches his attention, he\u2019s absolutely capable of blowing off your friend\u2019s commands and dashing into traffic after it.", "Service dogs (real ones) are highly trained. They're also ALWAYS on a leash.  Police dogs, also trained, also leashed. The only dogs not on a leash are working farm dogs (or maybe fru-fru purse dogs). It's just safer for the dog. Too bad the one who really cares for Jeffy is you.", "Her demand that you walk the dog without a leash is crazy to me.", "Send her these threads", "He immediately obeyed ONLY 85% of commands--by his owner, in his home, without new distractions!? \n\nOh, yes, what a very disciplined and well trained dog! /s", "So you're in a place where feral dogs are common and she still doesn't want to leash her pet? Forget Jeffy causing a problem, he's likely to get mauled."]}
