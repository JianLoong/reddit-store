Beth has a boyfriend, Michael, and they've been together about 9 months. I now live abroad, but I was spending December in my home city to see friends/family. Since Beth got together with Michael, Michael has becomes quite a good friend to me also. When I visited them at the beginning of December, Michael was talking about the company he'd recently joined, and how it was kind of an 'old boys club' type place (family money, nepotism baby, work hard play harder, city types), and he was having quite a hard time bonding with his team, especially his boss. He talked about the upcoming Christmas party, and then said his team all night because they tended to tease him about him not understanding their conversations. He mentioned a popular holiday destination a lot of the team had been to over the summer, where I have holidayed before, and I was explaining some things he said had come up in the conversation. He suddenly suggested that I come to his Christmas party with him and help him bridge the gap with his colleagues. Beth immediately agreed. \n\nHere's the thing - I asked Beth four times during that dinner if she was okay with this and she said yes. I asked her three times over the phone the day after when she was alone, and she said she was fine with it and that I was saving her from a stressful evening and doing something nice for Michael.\n\nI went to the party, and actually it was a nice evening. Michael and I were not physical AT ALL (obviously) but we are friends so it was fun to hang out, and his team are exactly what you'd expect, a little out of touch and immature but good fun for an evening. Michael thanked me profusely, even sent me flowers saying how much he appreciated it. I really thought I'd done a good thing.\n\nEver since, Beth has been ghosting me. I sent her several texts to meet up while I was in town and she ignored my calls and messages. I figured I'd speak to her about it in the new year, but yesterday when I sent her a Merry Christmas text she replied with a wall of text saying I had a nerve to try to be her friend after I completely destroyed her self esteem and how she can't believe I actually went to the party. I pointed out that I asked her multiple times if it was okay and she said yes, but her point is I should have just said I should have known that it would make her feel bad that Michael wanted to use me to impress people. I'll admit I suspected it did make her feel bad, but when she was pushing me to do it anyway I presumed she'd put her own feelings aside.

Why would you attending be better for him than his own partner? It\u2019s a rude request, and tbh, you should have seen it as one. What did you offer to make this seem like a good idea?

Its not your place to try to force her into meeting standards that you set in your head for *her* relationship.", "Yes; and I would expect any mature adult to bring the topic up openly and settle the issue amicably. Anything else is just teenage drama unworthy of anyone who passed their 20th birthday\n\nThe conflict only erupted because of her avoiding conflict, not OP doing anything wrong. \n\nIt's also just ludicrous to go off over OP attending a Christmas party with her friend.

She might not be wrong with what she said but that should be directed at her boyfriend.", "It *should* be standard, but that doesn't make it so. A surprisingly high number of women suffer abusive relationships quietly while all their friends and family love the person doing it because he isn't abusive to *them*. \n\nYou admit you knew she wasn't comfortable with it, yet you did it anyways. You seem like you want to be told you're not in the wrong because you had technically had the right to do it. But you have a social obligation to your friend, not her boyfriend. If she doesn't want you getting involved in her relationship or getting involved with her boyfriend like that, then you don't. \n\nIt seems like she feels like she can't speak her mind to you because you'll do what you want to do regardless of your awareness of her feelings, and she's 100% right, because that's exactly what you did.", "NTA\n\nBut. Michael likes you. Beth is jealous. And you should have said no. What happens next time Michael needs to bring his GF to work? See the dilema right? \n\nYou dont play someone else GF when you are engaged. Hell you never play some else GF. Jesus we are dealing with children in here.", "Should Beth have said no? Absolutely. But the fact that you, as her girl friend, thought it was even remotely appropriate to accept Michael's insanely insensitive invite shows you either don't care about your friend much or are incredibly clueless.", "YtA and so is he. How anyone thought this would be okay I have no clue.  How he wouldn\u2019t know that this would hurt her feelings and make his girlfriend feel like shit I don\u2019t know that either. And how you as both their friends wouldn\u2019t see that this was such a bad idea is crazy. OMG are you a beauty queen?? why would he think you would impress the \u201cold Boys Club\u201d. This is totally Fucked up and I bet she was both embarrassed and so hurt she couldn\u2019t say anything and her boyfriend sucks for putting her in the situation and you suck as a friend who wouldn\u2019t say \u201chell no this is s dumb idea\u201d!!!  But you probably don\u2019t have to worry for long because I am sure your friendship with her is over. And their relationship will be over soon if not already.", "Soft ESH. I have to ask how you would feel if the roles were reversed -- if your partner decided that Beth would be a better date than you.\n\nI think the biggest tell here is that you \"admit that you suspected it made her feel bad\"", "NTA.  she probably already resented you from before,  for being better off than her or whatever, and orchestrated this trap in order to express her cumulate resentments against you and stop being friends", "NTA.  You can't be expected to read minds.  Best to find friends who are able to talk.", "NTA. Beth is incredibly insecure. I hope she breaks up with the boyfriend -- she needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nBut, personally, I would distance myself from Michael and ask him to have a talk with Beth because he hurt her a lot. \n\nShe should have said something and he shouldn't even have asked that. What type of person doesn't have the emotional empathy to understand that their SO would be hurt by them asking a friend to be their date to impress people? It seems like he finds their SO less than and doesn't find them enough for his circle. But, as I said, she should have said something. That being said, I think you took a **big** gamble by being the date of a friend's bf, this would obviously cause hurt.\n\nI honestly feel like she thought she could put her feelings aside and be the \"cool girlfriend\" and understand. But when it came to the time, her feelings came crashing down and she targeted you. She must have felt worthless, not enough and that her bf doesn't see her value, and he sees the value of her friend and sees her friend as someone worthy and her friend didn't even stop this and was fine with it. Because of this she is channeling her feelings towards you. \n\n\nIf you want to continue the friendship try to have a talk with Beth and explain everything, that what you were doing you thought you were doing for her and for Michael's career. You never thought of him any other way. Ask what you can do about it now and if there are boundaries she would like to discuss.\n\nEdit: he invited you to a date and sent you flowers... this would be the end for me if I was Beth tbh", "NTA her insecurities aren't your problem. Especially since you asked several times if she was okay with you going.", "NTA- Everyone in this situation is an adult. You asked multiple times if she was okay and she replied yes each time. I also assume she has PLENTY of time to come to you after the agreement to air out her concerns.\n\n\n\nPeople pointing out that you asked multiple times if things are okay means you knew it wasn't okay is bullshit. You asked to get AN HONEST ANSWER. She lied. She only has herself to blame. \n\nInfo: were you introduced as the girlfriend? I wonder what the boyfriend has to say about all this.", "So much NTA, Beth has to grow up", "op=NTA\n\nHonestly, why couldn't Beth just use her d\\*mn words.  You were trying to do them a favor.  <rolls eyes>.  \n\nWhat other Drama has Beth created through her mixed messages? And how often do you have to apologize for doing the \"wrong\" thing???", "NTA consent was given!", "NTA (Michael is the primary AH here), but you should have known better. Whether you predicted this specific outcome or not, it was definitely foreseeable that mess would come of this. It's like when a couple is in an argument and starts asking you as a bystander to agree with one of them and take a side - no matter what you think about it, it's best not to get roped into their situation because once you're in the middle of it there's no getting out. This is like that, but before the argument starts. \"I'm not getting involved\" is a great sentence that saves a person a lot of trouble in life.", "NTA technically didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It\u2019s def weird that a guy would take his girlfriends friend on a date to impress their coworkers. Faking it like this rarely works out. And I can see why Beth feels badly.\n\nHowever I can\u2019t stand when someone repeatedly says they are ok with something when asked point blank multiple times, and then after the fact, claim that you should have \u201cjust known\u201d their words were meaningless and they\u2019d actually feel the opposite.", "NTA you are never at fault when the only way you would have known something is to be a mind reader. Beth needs to learn how to use her words; all the comments taking her side are pretty damn patronizing. Her relationship can\u2019t be that great if they are unable to communicate about things like this, but again - not on you.", "Nta. People who expect others to be mind reader are infuriating ! \n\nPerhaps will she became one of those partner who sulk and sulk for a perceived slight which she didn't bother to explain. It's exhausting !", "NTA\n\nIs this becoming the new pattern? I swear I just read a few posts about a girl going out with her friends bf, another taking the friends boyfriend to meet her parents when her *own* boyfriend hasn\u2019t even met them yet, etc. \n\nAll in all I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole because at the end of the day he himself asked you to go with him. And its his responsibility and hers to manage their relationship. If this was a problem she definitely should have talked to him about it. This feels like an invisible boundary being crossed. She should work on her communication with Michael", "NTA. They asked and you agreed.", "NTA. Beth is an unclean ass hole, pompous, immature, ignorant, childish drama queen. Cut losses and move on.", "She was putting aside her feelings for him. Would have been ok but he probably bragged about you afterward.  His coworkers also likely flattered him about his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and he probably told her.\n\nSo she can\u2019t be mad at herself or him.  That leaves you.", "NTA  But I suspect that Michael had a better time with you than Beth expected.  Even if nothing happened the fact that you were able to get along with his coworkers may have left her feeling like maybe she couldn\u2019t measure up.", "I was fairly certain I would vote Y T A, but actually not at all. OP asked Beth multiple times even when she was alone, to make sure what her feelings were. This is ridiculous that she and their friends are making OP feel bad.", "I think some info is missing. What exactly happened at the party or thereafter, to send Beth over the edge? But, she sounds immature and high maintenance for playing these games.", "I agree that Beth should have honestly told OP to not go, but it's pretty evident from OP's comments that OP knew that Beth wasn't really comfortable with this situation, otherwise why would OP ask Beth multiple times? OP had a feeling that this was a bad idea, and should have dropped it. I think it's ESH. OP was definitely partly to blame.", "Oh please, OP mentioned in her comment that she knew that Beth was keeping her own feelings aside, even though she was feeling bad and still said yes to the idea for her bf. OP was a good friend to bf, but I think OP is not a real friend to Beth. If Beth and Op were friends, OP wouldn't have done what she did, Beth should drop both their sorry asses. She deserves better.", "Is\u2026 this\u2026 Gossip Girl?", "This should be the top comment. NTA at all BUT definitely a situation that you just should not put yourself in. Some people are okay with the idea of things but don't take into account that sometimes you can't control how things make you feel once they're done. If you really value the friendship, I'd bite the bullet and just apologize so that Beth knows you didn't mean to cause any harm.", "Oh bullshit. The GF was fine with it until it happened.", "Wallahi so then the girl should\u2019ve said no.", "I\u2019m guessing the friend wasn\u2019t honest because she felt ashamed :(", "NTA. People act like males and females can\u2019t be friends and it\u2019s so weird. Like did y\u2019all even read the post? You did a nice thing op, it seems like you helped Michael become closer to his coworkers. You asked Beth a thousand times if it was okay, she said yes. So I\u2019m not sure why she is mad. If she had a problem  with it, she should have opened her mouth.", "I probably would have done what I thought she did, felt kind of bad but put my feelings aside and gone along with it. \n\nI did suspect there was an initial sting (about Michael not wanting to take her, not about me going), but more in a \u201cwow this is awkward, but if it\u2019ll help Micheal it is what it is\u201d kind of way. I didn\u2019t think she felt it that deeply or that she had felt bad about it and the whole time.", "Also, what are you going to do about all the other events he will have? If he asks you to attend (regardless of your friendship or lack of friendship with Beth at this point) would you go to them?", "It all boils down to her insecurity. She probably felt that she wasn\u2019t good enough to be in her BF\u2019s work environment, that she would be as insecure as him, and you saved the day with your charm, knowledge and class. Probably the fact that he sent you flowers was the last straw. Still, NONE OF THAT was your fault. Beth has to work on her own self esteem issues. You were doing your friend a favor.", "She just gettin a taste of what men go through with women\u2026 lol \n\nThis is tough but you should not have went no matter what Beth said. This is how people put themselves in temptation to cheat. YTA", "Yeah, but the fact that OP asked Beth multiple times, and 4 times the next day proves that she could sense the awkwardness of Beth. I think Beth felt obligated to say Yes, and OP knew that, but still went ahead with Beth's bf.", "Sometimes adults do things they aren't 100% comfortable with and it isn't other people's fault for not ignoring their claims that it's a manageable level of discomfort when they're upset by them. OP did the right thing when you have a feeling someone isn't comfortable doing something: confirm that it's still something they want to do. It isn't your right or responsibility to take the decision away from them because you decide they can't be trusted to make it.", "If Beth and OP were friends, Beth would have acted like a true friend (and acted like an adult) and opened her mouth and used her words.  But Beth chose the passive aggressive route.  They are all adults, if you have a problem with a friend, open your fucking mouth and say it.  It's not that hard.", "It doesn't matter. The OP isn't interested.", "The fact you knew he was taking you rather than your friend/ his gf to look better, should tell you everything\u2026. Of course that would be hurtful to her, and by going in full awareness of the above, you\u2019re basically admitting to also feeling that way!", "Do you just assume all people are confident and comfortable with confrontation? If she is shy as OP said she was likely really embarrassed, particularly when it was 2 against 1 suggesting the friend go in her place. I can see my younger self agreeing to something like that due to feeling inferior and embarrassed also. It\u2019s humiliating to admit her partner thinks the friend is an upgrade", "Surely her voice sounded different, sad/quiet when she agreed? Surely you sensed her feelings may have been hurt", "This isn\u2019t about fancying her partner\u2026. It\u2019s about allowing your friend to feel inferior. And being complicit in something shitty her party has done to her.\n\n\u2026.I wonder if maybe you do feel more attractive or interesting than her based on your comments on this thread", "Yeah but can you understand why this would make her upset? Because if your fianc\u00e9 tried to ask a friend of yours on a date to try to impress his friends, it would be pretty hurtful and f*cked up... \n\nShe should have said something but I think you (without  malice) really stepped a boundary there.", "Yeah, I mean she definitely should've communicated her feelings to you sooner. But I suspect there\u2019s a lot going unsaid between her and Michael rn. Pretty shite situation for everyone. Also that \u201cold boys club\u201d party sounds like a party I\u2019d personally not wanna be at either lol", "Beth could also have talked to her boyfriend\u2026", "But that's not on OP.  Even if she could sense the awkwardness, it's not on OP to do anything beyond what she did do.  She asked, Beth's an adult and could have acted like one, but she didn't.", "Bingo!", "Why was she wrong when they both asked her to go?", "Then she should\u2019ve said no. But she didn\u2019t. Nobody is a mind reader.", "Sometimes people choose to do things they would rather not because they feel it's a worthwhile sacrifice to make and it isn't other people's place to ignore their expressed wishes because they've decided they know what's best for them better than they do. That's just presumptuous.", "I feel bad that that\u2019s how she felt. It definitely wasn\u2019t my intention. I felt like they were a team in asking me, not that I was taking a side. Evidently I might have been wrong about that.\n\nBut I don\u2019t feel more or less anything than anyone, ever. Comparing yourself to others makes life very long and very tiring, in my opinion.", "OP claims to be Beth's friend, I get that it's not OP's responsibility, but as her friend, OP should have done what's good for Beth, not the bf.", "Its more like OP was acting as a\u2026. guide dog? Or a tour guide maybe? I cant think of a better term than a guide dog but that sounds rude. She helped the bf understand what was going on when he couldn\u2019t fully grasp it and allowed him to excel in a place he would normally falter. OPs prior experience (training?) gave her a special advantage in this scenario and they paired together to advance the dudes career prospects. OPs friend is probably just jealous because bf was probably gushing about how great she was and that it was a good idea, how fun the night was, etc\u2026 Then she realized he never said those things when they we\u2019re together. Which is normal because they\u2019re both there. Not going to retell stories about a person to that same person.\n\nThe only way Id see this as bad is if bf/gf have been together for like 10 years and the workplace knows her, then a new girl shows up.", "So you already know she\u2019s really shy\u2026 surely then you KNOW she is likely not to kick up a big fuss when you asked her? Come on\u2026.. it\u2019s so obvious", "Even Beth herself said that OP would be doing her a favor by saving Beth from having to go. From OP's perspective, she was still doing what was good for Beth. I'm sorry, but if you don't say how you actually feel, you don't get to be upset when things turn out a way you don't like when you could've said something.", "She did do what good for Beth.  She gave Beth multiple opportunities to say what was on her mind, and Beth CHOSE not to.  It's Beth's fault that Beth is upset.", "Being a friend (between two adults) doesn\u2019t mean holding hands like one or the other is a child. Same could be said about Beth.", "If you yourself cannot state your uncomfortable, then don\u2019t get shocked and upset and sad when things don\u2019t go your way.", "This sounds silly as hell. If it was an issue she shouldn\u2019t have said YES. Period. End of the discussion. I\u2019m not sure what angle your gearing at either because she definitely doesn\u2019t want her man.", "This is too much non-sense. Beth could have yea and let her yes he yea or said no and let her no be no. End of case. No need for the extra unnecessary childish bullshit", "I agree with OP.  If she is uncomfortable with that, she should have that conversation with her boyfriend, not expect OP to not do something because she can read her mind", "It has 0 to do with her man, and I never insinuated OP wanted him at all. \n\nOP said in retrospect it was an awful idea, but then doesn\u2019t take any responsibility in that. I\u2019m asking her why she initially felt it was a good idea. And her only answer was \u2018because he asked me\u2019. Which takes 0 ownership, and is a bullshit answer.\n\nAlso,  asked her friend 4 times. You don\u2019t ask 4 times if it\u2019s NBD.", "So then I\u2019m asking, what are you getting at? \nYour saying OP is an AH because what?\n\nYou ask for consent multiple times when you do sexual activity right? Okay same concept. You want consent before hand.", "? OP went out of her way to discuss things with Beth and she at no point indicated that she wasn\u2019t perfectly fine with the plan. The point isn\u2019t that she did it. It\u2019s that she did it WITH EXPLICIT PERMISSION AND ASSURANCE and is being punished for \u201cnot knowing better\u201d??? I\u2019d love to have the mind reading skills you seem to possess. OP did her friends a favor and didn\u2019t even claim to have interest in the even outside of hanging out with a friend, which didn\u2019t have to happen there. At the end of the day, you and Beth are both setting unrealistic expectations for people to know some unspoken and outwardly denied boundaries. So yeah. NTA.", "So I\u2019m curious. Do you think she\u2019s being abused by her boyfriend? If no then what your saying is delusional.", "Thank you lol she\u2019s a grown woman she can say yes or no"]}
