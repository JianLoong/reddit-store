Beth has a boyfriend, Michael, and they've been together about 9 months. I now live abroad, but I was spending December in my home city to see friends/family. Since Beth got together with Michael, Michael has becomes quite a good friend to me also. When I visited them at the beginning of December, Michael was talking about the company he'd recently joined, and how it was kind of an 'old boys club' type place (family money, nepotism baby, work hard play harder, city types), and he was having quite a hard time bonding with his team, especially his boss. He talked about the upcoming Christmas party, and then said his team all night because they tended to tease him about him not understanding their conversations. He mentioned a popular holiday destination a lot of the team had been to over the summer, where I have holidayed before, and I was explaining some things he said had come up in the conversation. He suddenly suggested that I come to his Christmas party with him and help him bridge the gap with his colleagues. Beth immediately agreed. \n\nHere's the thing - I asked Beth four times during that dinner if she was okay with this and she said yes. I asked her three times over the phone the day after when she was alone, and she said she was fine with it and that I was saving her from a stressful evening and doing something nice for Michael.\n\nI went to the party, and actually it was a nice evening. Michael and I were not physical AT ALL (obviously) but we are friends so it was fun to hang out, and his team are exactly what you'd expect, a little out of touch and immature but good fun for an evening. Michael thanked me profusely, even sent me flowers saying how much he appreciated it. I really thought I'd done a good thing.\n\nEver since, Beth has been ghosting me. I sent her several texts to meet up while I was in town and she ignored my calls and messages. I figured I'd speak to her about it in the new year, but yesterday when I sent her a Merry Christmas text she replied with a wall of text saying I had a nerve to try to be her friend after I completely destroyed her self esteem and how she can't believe I actually went to the party. I pointed out that I asked her multiple times if it was okay and she said yes, but her point is I should have just said I should have known that it would make her feel bad that Michael wanted to use me to impress people. I'll admit I suspected it did make her feel bad, but when she was pushing me to do it anyway I presumed she'd put her own feelings aside. My fianc\u00e9 says it's not my fault and that Beth should have been honest instead of expecting me to read her mind, but a couple of my friends say I should probably have just said no in solidaroty.

Why would you attending be better for him than his own partner? It\u2019s a rude request, and tbh, you should have seen it as one. What did you offer to make this seem like a good idea? That you know about a travel spot?

Its not your place to try to force her into meeting standards that you set in your head for *her* relationship.", "Yes; and I would expect any mature adult to bring the topic up openly and settle the issue amicably. Anything else is just teenage drama unworthy of anyone who passed their 20th birthday\n\nThe conflict only erupted because of her avoiding conflict, not OP doing anything wrong. \n\nIt's also just ludicrous to go off over OP attending a Christmas party with her friend.

Of course Michael is definitely an AH, he clearly didn\u2019t take Beth\u2019s feelings into consideration at all.  You going with him to the event was insensitive and I think you can understand that, especially since you asked her so many times. However, try to see why she wouldn\u2019t want to say anything.

Try to see it from her perspective. Her bf wanted to take her close friend to a party instead of her and her friend happily accepted (asking her repeatedly if she was okay with it is meaningless now). Then to add insult to injury her inconsiderate bf sent her friend flowers (gross).  \n\nOverall Michael is a moron but I do hope you can mend the friendship. Maybe try to take her to dinner and talk it out. If she agrees make sure you listen and not be defensive.

Michael, because he thought bringing you instead of his gf would be better for / advance his career (ouch), Beth for not communicating that she's not okay with the plan and telling you afterwards you should have known that - eventhough you asked multiple times and she gave her okay...and you because you went along with pretending to be the gf of a guy who's in a relationship with your friend, and you're engaged.\n\nDid you ask your fianc\u00e9 if he was okay with the play-pretend couple thing? Would you have gone along if it had made him uncomfortable?", "Esh, but Beth is only a little bit for not saying anything. You, and her bf both suck.", "ESH. I was waiting for the part where Beth was not available to go, like out of town or something. Michael is an asshole for asking someone else to pose as his GF because, presumably, you're more conventionally attractive than his real and completely available girlfriend.

I don't think I'd personally would have gone as his gf. As a good friend, okay, maybe because his gf was otherwise engaged but not posing as his partner.

Someone who thinks it\u2019s a good idea and NBD doesn\u2019t ask 4 times. \n\nAnd your \u2018Beth isn\u2019t always the easiest\u2026\u2019 turn just looks bad. Because at first you\u2019re all \u2018it was his idea, I just went along with it, idk.\u2019 and then you end with \u2018well, aksually\u2026she\u2019s this that and the other\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not a good look.", "So his coworkers probably are under the assumption you guys did go as a couple. She might not be wrong with what she said but that should be directed at her boyfriend.", "It *should* be standard, but that doesn't make it so. A surprisingly high number of women suffer abusive relationships quietly while all their friends and family love the person doing it because he isn't abusive to *them*. \n\nYou admit you knew she wasn't comfortable with it, yet you did it anyways. You seem like you want to be told you're not in the wrong because you had technically had the right to do it. But you have a social obligation to your friend, not her boyfriend. If she doesn't want you getting involved in her relationship or getting involved with her boyfriend like that, then you don't. \n\nIt seems like she feels like she can't speak her mind to you because you'll do what you want to do regardless of your awareness of her feelings, and she's 100% right, because that's exactly what you did."]}
