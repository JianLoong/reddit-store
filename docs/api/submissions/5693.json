Beth has a boyfriend, Michael, and they've been together about 9 months. I now live abroad, but I was spending December in my home city to see friends/family. Since Beth got together with Michael, Michael has becomes quite a good friend to me also. When I visited them at the beginning of December, Michael was talking about the company he'd recently joined, and how it was kind of an 'old boys club' type place (family money, nepotism baby, work hard play harder, city types), and he was having quite a hard time bonding with his team, especially his boss. He talked about the upcoming Christmas party, and then said his team all night because they tended to tease him about him not understanding their conversations. He mentioned a popular holiday destination a lot of the team had been to over the summer, where I have holidayed before, and I was explaining some things he said had come up in the conversation. He suddenly suggested that I come to his Christmas party with him and help him bridge the gap with his colleagues. Beth immediately agreed. \n\nHere's the thing - I asked Beth four times during that dinner if she was okay with this and she said yes. I asked her three times over the phone the day after when she was alone, and she said she was fine with it and that I was saving her from a stressful evening and doing something nice for Michael.\n\nI went to the party, and actually it was a nice evening. Michael and I were not physical AT ALL (obviously) but we are friends so it was fun to hang out, and his team are exactly what you'd expect, a little out of touch and immature but good fun for an evening. Michael thanked me profusely, even sent me flowers saying how much he appreciated it. I really thought I'd done a good thing.\n\nEver since, Beth has been ghosting me. I sent her several texts to meet up while I was in town and she ignored my calls and messages. I figured I'd speak to her about it in the new year, but yesterday when I sent her a Merry Christmas text she replied with a wall of text saying I had a nerve to try to be her friend after I completely destroyed her self esteem and how she can't believe I actually went to the party. I pointed out that I asked her multiple times if it was okay and she said yes, but her point is I should have just said I should have known that it would make her feel bad that Michael wanted to use me to impress people. I'll admit I suspected it did make her feel bad, but when she was pushing me to do it anyway I presumed she'd put her own feelings aside.

You going with him to the event was insensitive and I think you can understand that, especially since you asked her so many times. However, try to see why she wouldn\u2019t want to say anything. Beth probably felt too awkward or hurt to say anything and now her anger at the situation is coming out, understandably. \n\nAlso him sending you flowers was inappropriate. Try to see it from her perspective. Her bf wanted to take her close friend to a party instead of her and her friend happily accepted (asking her repeatedly if she was okay with it is meaningless now). Then to add insult to injury her inconsiderate bf sent her friend flowers (gross).  \n\nOverall Michael is a moron but I do hope you can mend the friendship. Maybe try to take her to dinner and talk it out. If she agrees make sure you listen and not be defensive.

Michael, because he thought bringing you instead of his gf would be better for / advance his career (ouch), Beth for not communicating that she's not okay with the plan and telling you afterwards you should have known that - eventhough you asked multiple times and she gave her okay...and you because you went along with pretending to be the gf of a guy who's in a relationship with your friend, and you're engaged.\n\nDid you ask your fianc\u00e9 if he was okay with the play-pretend couple thing? Would you have gone along if it had made him uncomfortable?", "Esh, but Beth is only a little bit for not saying anything. You, and her bf both suck.", "ESH. I was waiting for the part where Beth was not available to go, like out of town or something. Michael is an asshole for asking someone else to pose as his GF because, presumably, you're more conventionally attractive than his real and completely available girlfriend.

What type of person doesn't have the emotional empathy to understand that their SO would be hurt by them asking a friend to be their date to impress people? It seems like he finds their SO less than and doesn't find them enough for his circle. But, as I said, she should have said something.

But when it came to the time, her feelings came crashing down and she targeted you. She must have felt worthless, not enough and that her bf doesn't see her value, and he sees the value of her friend and sees her friend as someone worthy and her friend didn't even stop this and was fine with it. Because of this she is channeling her feelings towards you. \n\n\nIf you want to continue the friendship try to have a talk with Beth and explain everything, that what you were doing you thought you were doing for her and for Michael's career.

But years later I found out her ex had a thing for me and she knew about it. They didn\u2019t have a healthy relationship while together, but it wasn\u2019t that clear on the outside at the time.

Then sending flowers afterwards is....yeah...\n\nHow does shit like this even happen? I feel like I'm in the twilight zone reading some of these stories.", "What\u2019s inappropriate about it? Are they adults or no!", "I will apologise to her if there\u2019s any way it came across like that from my end because that isn\u2019t and has never been my opinion", "Bingo", "They hadn\u2019t met Beth, since he doesn\u2019t socialise with them outside of work. They knew he wasn\u2019t single, but I don\u2019t think they knew too much about his relationship otherwise they would have been more surprised to see there.\n\nI\u2019m the same, btw. If my fianc\u00e9 is away on business or just doesn\u2019t want to do something, I will normally attend sporting or social events with my male friends and it\u2019s not weird. I guess the difference was here it wasn\u2019t a mutual interest it was definitely \u201cfavour\u201d territory, and it was for a specific purpose.", "The agreement was he would introduce me by my name, and we wouldn\u2019t specify the relationship, and that\u2019s what he did.", "Sorry but it\u2019s pretty obvious not to pretend to be your friend\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s gf as it would impress his friends more than the real gf, your friend. Of Course that would be hurtful", "He didn\u2019t introduce me as his girlfriend, just by my name. I presume they figured we were dating but not official. We didn\u2019t play up to the \u201ccouple\u201d thing at all though.", "It\u2019s like her friend was testing her and by going to the Christmas party she failed the test.", "You must be Beth. OP is not a mind reader nor should she be babysitting a grown woman\u2019s discomfort because she can\u2019t be vocal about her feelings. That\u2019s not her responsibility. It\u2019s Beth who needs to own up to her lack of communication skills and blaming others for that. \n\nQuite frankly if I was OP, I would drop Beth as a friend. She just sounds like an exhausting insecure mess.", "So, you\u2019re not like other girls?", "You don\u2019t need to apologize to her. She is the one who said you should go because it would free her up from the stress. Beth needs to grow a spine and not expect people to read her mind.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. She had multiple chances to voice her feelings on the matter. Quite frankly OP, Beth sounds exhausting and not on your level. Why are you friends with her?", "Oh you fucked up big time. Major YTA. \nIf you need it to be explained \n1. The invitation implied you were better than Beth - by saying yes you basically agreed with this\n2. Regardless of acting couple like or not that is what his colleagues will think - which totally invalidates your friends relationship and future events involving her\n3. You knew she was uncomfortable with this - you wouldn\u2019t have asked her multiple times if you didn\u2019t\n4. You a person engaged pretended to be dating someone else also in a relationship - that is never okay and never going to end well.", "Do your friends pretend to be your bf during those times?\n\nAlso, you both realise what you did is not a long term solution. Now Beth can never go as his actual spouse without explaining it or making something up and lying about their relationship.", "Mm. NTA, but yea you definitely got caught in your friends trap/test for the both of you. She should have just said she wasn\u2019t comfortable, and if she only started feel bad about it after the fact then she should have waited to have a conversation with you about it, not lashed out on Christmas", "I see absolutely no problem at all then. If I had a friend and asked them 7 times if they were okay with something, I'd expect them to be honest with me at least one of those times. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Uh, how does that make OP an A? Cheating is a CHOICE and if you're not mature enough to \"aVoId TeMpTaTiOn\" then you're not mature enough to be in a relationship at all.", "Haha, no I\u2019m a lot like about 50% of other girls. I know a lot of girls like me and a lot of girls like Beth. We do not live the \u201cpick me\u201d life here \ud83d\ude02", "Stop being a little shit, you know that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying.", "Yeah, but it explains why he made such an odd request", "She gave the friend multiple opportunities to tell her if she did not want her to go or if she felt bad about it. She had no way of knowing that her weird vibes stemmed from a place of insecurity/inferiority rather than just feeling weird bc it\u2019s a strange situation. \n\nIf you ask \u201chey are you okay with this\u201d more than 3 times then by the third/fourth time you have taken their answer as confirmation. Most people are more inclined to believe what people tell them to their face rather than their brief gut feeling. Since Beth said yes, it\u2019s her own fault if OP went, she didn\u2019t like it, and now feels wronged by her friend and bf.\n\nI didn\u2019t read anything that gave me a sense of superiority from her comments. She expressed that she was well suited for the specific type of people she would be around\ndue to years of experience. It seems that Michael, Beth, and OP all know Beth would not be comfortable and would be shy in such an event. OP even said she experienced the same thing with women, so she presented it as a situational awkwardness, that also affected her, rather than Beth\u2019s personal flaw.", "Well who problem is that? Nobody took advantage of this woman. She had the opportunity to speak to her friend in private the very next day without her partner being around, also she can text.", "And she knows it", "I acknowledged it was not the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I pretended to be Beth. He could take Beth to the next Christmas party and introduce her as his girlfriend, it wouldn\u2019t be odd to think that in the intervening year he\u2019d got a new girlfriend. He could also clarify that he and I were never dating, we never said or acted like we were. This didn\u2019t paint Beth into a corner", "It is on OP to be a good friend. She says in the comments it was to imply she was his gf to the work friends\u2026 no one needs someone to tell them that\u2019s not what a good friend would do, particularly to someone she knows is shy. She also admits to suspecting it would hurt her. Not everyone is comfortable with confrontation, particularly if they are made to feel silly for their hurt feelings.", "Oddly capitalizing your letters doesn\u2019t prove a point. You should never put yourself in situations like that with someone else\u2019s significant other. The boyfriend is also the asshole here. Beth should have just expressed her true feelings, but like most woman there is a lot of guess work with emotions.", "I totally understand trying to help advance my friend\u2019s BF in his career. I actually have done this kind of intervention:) a few times, BUT I wasn\u2019t dealing with a Beth. Beth should be upset with her BF IF she is going to be upset with her friend for trying to help. It was her BF\u2019s idea. Beth is sending mixed messages. I don\u2019t blame OP for trying to help at all. I do wish she would have realized Beth was not open about her feelings.  OP wasn\u2019t AH, BUT Beth thinks so. I hope BF lets Beth know she did say all this was ok!", "Agree on all counts. I still can tell you, OP is going to be the bad guy here. I didn\u2019t say she was the AH for going. I do wish she would have realized Beth was not a forthcoming person. I hope BF doesn\u2019t let OP take the fall?!", "Sorry I should have been clearer. I don\u2019t think she was wrong in going. I do KNOW she is going to be the fall guy. Sadly. I guess I am expecting her to be a mind reader here, and that is bullshit on my part. Beth obviously isn\u2019t a forthcoming person and gave mixed signals. I hope BF lets Beth know, straightaway, \u201cYou said ok\u201d. I am hoping this happens. I honestly am not sure if it will.", "Nah, I think he\u2019s just desperate to fit in at work.", "I think his coworkers now think you are his gf and are constantly talking about you. And probably now if she is introduced they will mock him.", "Maybe Beth should have the confidence to be upfront about her feelings on the matter rather than going along with it hoping that OP could read her mind. She\u2019s a grown ass woman and should act like one.\n\nMaybe OP kept asking because she knows her friend is non confrontational but punishes after the fact. Beth sounds exhausting and insecure. She need to work on her communication skills. OP did nothing wrong. She is not a mind reader.", "But Beth is clearly comfortable with confrontation since she confronted OP after the party took place.", "I don't see how anyone can see her as wrong.  BF invited her, in front of his girlfriend, girlfriend was fine, and had ample opportunity to say \"you know, after thinking, I would be uncomfortable with this\".  Instead she pretended everything was fine when she could have stopped it, and is now mad in hindsight", "I agree. He\u2019s really just desperate to fit in and doing whatever he can to get a leg up.", "No. When somebody asks me multiple times if I was okay with something, I wouldn't and never have lied multiple times knowing that I wasn't.\n\n>Or gone along with something the entire group seemed excited about even though you hated the idea?\n\nIn this situation I just make it clear I'm not interested and don't participate.", "Circle back to my very first comment.", "Well I just did and you said ESH except for the person who repeatedly lied and said she was okay with something she wasn't okay with.

Enjoy playing the victim though.", "I\u2019m going with ESH, especially Michael though.\n\nBeth should\u2019ve spoken up about her feelings but she was just being dumb and wanted you guys to take the initiative to say no. \n\nI can\u2019t believe Michael had the nerve and the AUDACITY to ask another girl on a date in front of his girlfriend!! Like WTF!!!\n\nYou\u2019re also TA because you should\u2019ve just declined his invitation. You\u2019re an adult too and you even asked her 7 times if it was okay with her because why?? Because you knew it was a little weird to go. Btw, you\u2019re engaged and you went on a date with another man?? Wth girl? \n\nI hope Beth finds a better boyfriend and a better friend.", "NTA.

If Beth didn\u2019t want you to go, she should have used her big girl words to let you know.", "NTA. All these ESH and YTA are absurd. Beth literally told you to go. You repeatedly double-checked, and she chose to lie to you by confirming she was not only ok with you going, but appreciated it. \n\nBeth was being manipulative and immature, the entirety of this issue lies with her. It was her responsibility to communicate if she had any issue, for her to expect you to miraculously see through her lies and hold you accountable for her choices is beyond ridiculous.", "NTA.

I say good riddance, you need to be surrounded by people who are able to speak their minds and express their feelings in a mature way, not children playing games", "NTA. Beth was probably fine with it until Michael came home and absolutely raved about how great you were at the party.", "NTA", "Uh i would say ESH.\n\nBeth should have been honest.\nYou shouldn't have labeled it as a date when beth and Michael are still new in the relationship. You could have gone as just friends. \nMichael buying you flowers was wierd and a step too far. \n\nHere is what i am thinking. Maybe beth was fine with it until after. Maybe Michael talked about it alot and went on about how much fun he had with you which could have made her feel insecure. I mean i find it extremely wierd that he brought you flowers and that could have putt her off aswell. Maybe she feels he enjoyed time with you more than her. \n\nI feel every one is just looking at the fact that Beth saif she was fine when u asked her alot about it but who knows what happened afterwards that suddenly made her feel to disconnect.", "NTA but I feel like this was the obviously wrong choice\u2026", "Geez.

He should have never made that request. He could've gone alone if going with his girlfriend was a bad idea.\n\nYou knew it was a messy situation. You also admit in the comments that Beth wasn't as comfortable with it as she said she was. She probably didn't want to come off as clingy, jealous girlfriend over work event and I can see why she said what she said. I'd have honestly backed out from that.\n\nWorst thing is she's right. He did use you to impress them which meant that in his mind she's not that great compared to you and not worth of showing off. Ofc she wants to go NC.

She had a chance to act like an adult and she didn't, I didn't feel very bad about waltzing away from that friendship. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Beth was asked repeatedly, in private, if this was an issue and she insisted that were doing something nice for both her and her BF. It is not your fault that she basically lied to not only you, but her BF about it and now is acting as if you tried to steal him away. She needs to grow up and use her words so there's no misunderstanding.", "I feel like you're importing that presumption. Nowhere did OP  say they led anyone to believe anything about their relationship status.", "lol wtf?\n\nI was expecting a hard YTA for not informing your fiance \n\nBut I mean, if hes ok with you being someone else's bf... you really are NTA here.\n\nBeth is an AH. Better get rid of her now. She passive aggressively tried to trip you up. She has zero communication skills. And she has serious selfesteem issues.", "ESH. \nBeth should\u2019ve said it made her uncomfortable. \nMichael should not be inviting other girls to be his date when he has a girlfriend. \nYou should not be accepting to be a guys date when he has a gf and you have a fianc\u00e9. \n\nThis whole thing is wild.", "Your fiance is right! You asked her repeatedly, that gave her ample time to be honest. And it was clearly innocent & helpful", "NTA - \"she expected me to know\" uh-huh. Because among your many gifts you're a mind reader...... oh wait!  \n\nYou should absolutely not feel bad, have you talked to Michael?", "Totally don\u2019t agree with this as top comment. ESH. It was inappropriate of Michael to ask, and inappropriate of OP to accept. Beth could have spoken up but why put her in that position.", "Maybe for the best.", "Hence ESH.", "And he sent her flowers!! Like no. If I were her fianc\u00e9 I\u2019d feel disrespected.", "I'm going to agree with you here and ESH. Not to mention OP is pointing out how Beth is awkward and shy. So ofc she isn't going to stir up a fuss when asked multiple times, bc she doesn't want to upset her bf. If you have to ask multiple times--YOU KNOW. But hey, OP doesn't GET girls. She's one of the guys! Michael is 100% an AH, and honestly I hope Beth breaks up with him. But it's def an ESH moment...", "Nah man. If I were OP, the fact that she is my friend would make me more compelled to believe her when she literally says that it's okay. I'm the type of person who hates having to read people's minds and overthink, so if somebody I called my friend repeatedly gave me permission to do something, I would take that as okay", "I mean tbf saying the last person was my friend and this is my girlfriend to the company isn't really a big deal in the slightest.  Plenty of people bring friends as +1s to company parties.", "Nah, OP just trusted Beth a little too much. If my friends say they're okay with something 7 damn times, I'm gonna trust them and their judgement and input, rather than try to read their mind. Call me clueless but I'm tired of mind games and tests. I'll respect boundaries so long as somebody sets them, or even ATTEMPTS to set them.", "That's fucked up. He sounds like a narcissist.", "Leading people to imply you are dating because why else would he bring you?", "I think even asking was imposing and was weird. But agreed she should\u2019ve been honest about her feelings at least with her own partner. ESH.", "You said she's awkward in these situations, so you do think your better. It's not just 'how it came across to her'. Her imperfections shouldn't be enough to replace her for he night when she's still dating the guy.", "But you accepted. You stand taking any responsibility. It was weird to accept and not respectful to your friend or your fianc\u00e9.", "This", "Then he needs to grow professionally and as a human instead of playing Pretty Woman with his GF's out-of-town friend", "She still shouldn\u2019t have accepted. Weird all around.", "Well, my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t see it that way.", "I mean, she even points out they didn't touch during the evening. It seems pretty clear she didnt pretend to be his partner/arm candy. She was there because she could talk the same language as the guys who were there.", "This is the way", "They didn\u2019t act like she was his gf or fuck him though. He brought OP as a friend. Acting like this is any way a Pretty Women scenario is *way* off the mark and very judgmental of OP. I have no issue with sex work, but you\u2019re literally calling her a prostitute. You\u2019re acting like you\u2019re the immature gf who cannot express her true feelings directly.", "It's okay, you know. You made a mistake and you probably wont do something like this again, but you can move on and you dont have to feel like you're a bad friend, even if this friendship doesn't continue", "People need to be called out when they do this.", "So he has a gf in town .... And brings a totally random person \"as a friend\" from out of town instead .... Yeah not a great look and absolutely every one is talking about that fact in the inner circles (that he can't break into).  Get a grasp of reality", "Why, OP? That\u2019s both awkward and weird. Like, what about when he mentions Beth? \u201cOh yeah, I brought my side-piece\u201d, or \u201cyeah, we totally moved in together after dating for a week\u201d", "I don\u2019t think OP is in the wrong. I do think she read her friend poorly and is going to be the scapegoat no matter what.", "So why would gf lie to her friend and agree with this if she wasn\u2019t okay with it?", "YTA. There is a reason why you asked Beth 4 times before. You knew it was not right and still did it. And your comments about Beth being socially awkward are making yourself sound like THAT woman.", "NTA. My guess is Beth was probably fine with it until Michael came home bubbling over about how awesome OP was with his team, and then the flowers solidified all her insecurities.", "NTA she should have said no when he mentioned it", "Info\n\nWhy did you have to go as his gf and not a friend?\n\nAlso did Beth know you were going as a gf and not being called a friend?", "NTA! You have Beth so many chances to oppose you joining her BF. You tried. Why would you think otherwise? \n\nShe needs to learn to express herself accordingly.", "Beth was probably fine with it until the flowers got sent, that's what took her down the rabbit hole of self doubt which eventually lead to you being blamed for it", "NTA you checked with her if it was okay and she said yes, repeatedly.", "NTA She's a grown adult with a mind and a mouth to voice her feelings on matter.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing that makes sense of that all is this:  Your ex friend was using you as a reason to break up with her BF.  And this gives her reason and a person to blame.", "NTA.", "\nNTA. Beth should have told you her feelings from the get go. You are not a mind reader. NTA", "YTA. You suspected your shy friend would feel badly and did it anyway. Yes yes I know you \u201casked four times at dinner and three times over the phone\u201d but you\u2019ve said many times she is shy and awkward. Therefore you also likely knew she wouldn\u2019t confront you. You also noted in your comments that Michael did not clarify to his colleagues you\u2019re just a friend AND he bought you flowers?! \n\nYou\u2019ve also repeatedly said your friend is awkward/shy and referred to this as a Hallmark movie. This is all very weird imo", "Nta Beth needs to learn how to communicate", "YTA for failing for that foolery bs. But really your not NTA but learn from that situation. I see it has she is not really your friend like she trying test your loyalty or something. She knew she would have a problem with it but tried shrug it off. The friend is the AH", "Nope. **NTA** You asked several times to reaaally make sure she was ok with it. She actually encouraged you- so NO. She needs to own her words. You are not a mind reader.", "lol", "OP commented: \u201cThe agreement was he would introduce me by my name, and we wouldn\u2019t specify the relationship, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d", "This is the crux of the issue. ESH, though I still think Beth needs to grow the fuck up and use her words.", "OP is friends with both Beth and the BF, as she made clear in her OP. She was doing what was best for her friends. The one that asked for the favor and the one that thought it was a great idea."]}
