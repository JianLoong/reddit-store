You\u2019re NTA! If you are in a public space people cannot tell you to be quiet. You also can\u2019t predict where your dog is going to poop. At least you are a good person to clean it up. You should have thrown it at the lady. Lol. But NTA. Do what you gotta do to calm down your child. Those people\u2019s feelings don\u2019t necessarily matter.

Babies cry, you were being responsible for checking her and took her for a walk to calm her down.  The other woman was out of line", "NTA babies love being walked & is a very good idea - you both get some fresh air, in your case the dog also got walked & the baby is now sleeping. Maybe the lady needs to up her yoga classes - she doesn\u2019t sound very chilled out to me", "NTA If this person was practiced in meditation and yoga, they would have been able to calm down\u2026 Sounds like she needs a few more sessions\u2026 And the fact that she was dragged away by the other attendees shows you\u2019re clearly not the asshole here, And obviously the only reason you were stopped and not continuing past them was to pick up dog poop\u2026 That was certainly something you needed to do and be responsible for.", "Yes, children crying is ubiquitous in its displeasure, but that doesnt mean you cant go out for a walk of in public because of the crying. Kindergarden/pre-school run based wholeheartedly on that premise. \nNTA.", "??? NTA, you\u2019re trying everything you can to help your baby. Good for you.", "NTA.  Crying babies are a fact of life.  You'd tried to soothe her, run through other options, and settled on a walk.  You were in shared public space, which comes with no noise protection against crying babies.  You were even doing your civic duty cleaning up after your dog!!  The woman who approached you was totally the AH.  No six month old baby can be taught to be seen and not heard.  I'm sure the other members of her group were embarrassed by her.", "> One of the members of said class comes running up and yells at me for not controlling my daughter and training her to be seen and not heard. That she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to in public when she\u2019s like this\n\nThis person specifically is the asshole.\n\n> she said that it is kinda a asshole thing to do because nobody wants to listen to a baby cry.\n\nAnd your mum is also a bit of an asshole. \n\nBabies cry, public places are public places, and you were not staying in one spot doing nothing, you were moving in an attempt to help with the crying.\n\nGreat stuff from you, awful stuff from everyone else, pat on the back NTA.", "NTA...Babies cry. Humans of all ages make sounds.  Perhaps that lady is in need of a more rural experience.", "NTA. its a public area. noise are to be expected every now and then.", "TA wasn't you, but the dumbass thinking a 6mo baby could be 'trained' to do anything at all. Even more so for thinking they *should* be trained to be 'seen but not heard.' \n\nHowever, I will say that it would have polite if you had changed your walking route once you noticed the meditation/yoga group, if possible. Meditation is supposed to be calming and a crying baby isn't. So, NTA for the walk, but perhaps a little bit rude for your chosen path.", "NTA\n\nIts a public, outdoor space.  The women that yelled at you for not \"controlling\" your 6 month old babe is certifiably insane.  \n\nGo ahead and take your baby for a walk even if she is crying.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "Nobody wants to listen to a baby cry, but i'd never go tell a parent to \"train her to be seen and not heard\". It's a bloody baby, it's what they do. Furthermore, i don't want their yoga classes in my public spaces, but i don't go tell them to f\\*\\*\\* off (i hate gym classes and their lousy speakers most). NTA", "NTA. \u201cSeen not heard\u201d??? That\u2019s some Silent Generation bs. It\u2019s not like you walked her into a studio.", "NTA and what the heck is wrong with your Mom? Babies get to exist in public. That means sometimes they cry. Shame on your Mom (and that lady).", "NTA your daughter is allowed to be a baby in a public space. And you\u2019re walking! If she had left you alone you would have walked away even sooner. That lady sounds unhinged.", "NTA - You're right, nobody likes to hear a baby cry. That's why you walk rather than sit.", "NTA! I\u2019m not a parent, so correct me if this isn\u2019t common. I always thought taking a baby on a walk or on a short car ride is a way to soothe them. You couldn\u2019t help where the dog pooped and bagging up the poop takes what 30 seconds max? Like I\u2019m sure if they are outside other noises like big trucks and children playing are common distractions. So weird!", "Well forget Grandma watching the baby, she'll admonish it or worse for crying.  IF you had sat down by the yoga class and stayed for the entirety, then sure, but stopping for 90 seconds to clean up after your dog, you are NTA.", "NTA. Isn\u2019t the point of meditation to focus through the distractions?  Assuming that this yoga class was held outside in a park? If so, they don\u2019t get to expect peace and quiet in a public space.", "NTA. Smile sweetly and say, \u201chave you been told to F off today?\u201d", "Teething sucks!  You might ask your pediatrician about using Tylenol or Advil to help ease her pain--it made a huge difference with my kids.", "NTA Babies cry and the yoga tyrant will get over it. I've got 3 kids and I know things can seem so stressful. I can't imagine doing it alone so you're doing great to even be considering these things. It gets better, easier, you'll get some rest eventually. Right now you may feel like a zombie but the day will come when you realize you're well rested. You'll even start to miss the baby times. It's all part of the journey.", "NTA and omg the audacity of entitled people. Babies exist. People cry. You did nothing wrong. And you are right that oftentimes a walk in a carrier will help a fussy baby to settle. Good thinking, Dad. Sounds like your baby is lucky to have you.", "who the hell trains babies for to be seen and not heard???? the lady should have been trained like that by her parents lmao NTA", "The meditation/ yoga is obviously not working for that chick.", "NTA. Like, not even fucking close. \"Seen and not heard\"?? Fuck that. That shit is why I'm in therapy now as an adult. As a dad with a toddler, you did exactly the right thing to help your kiddo. Everyone else in this story sucks for clinging to outdated and harmful methods of childcare. Adults can regulate and put up with some crying for a few minutes, or at least, they should be able to. If they can't, then they are the ones who don't belong in public. Yoga lady was an AH and your mom needs to get with the times and be more supportive of her grandchild. Kids are people too and their emotions are just as valid as ours. It's not their fault they have limited ways to express it yet.", "Totally NTA.  That is a public space.  What if an emergency happened?  Was that person going to go and tell the first responder to have the emergency somewhere else because a yoga class was being held?  That was a bad move on their part, because if a session needs quiet, then they should be in a space where they can control the environment.  Anything can happen. Construction/ Accident/ Police chase... was she going to yell at everyone that disturbed their serenity?  NTA.", "How early? Screeching kids make the worst noise, but that lady sounds a bit deranged. \n\nYou taking your shrieking child out to share the noise with the neighbourhood instead of containing it to your house could be seen as obnoxious though, yeah.\n\nMight want to make sure the kid doesn\u2019t have acid reflux or anything.", "NTA shame on that woman and a curse on her cow. You are doing such amazing work just surviving these early months! Put them in water or go outside is what I was advised. You are doing a great job Dad! Keep it up! Don't let her comment get to you and instead read all these comments of support!", "Nta at all. It's a public space and kids of all ages make noise. A chiropractor really helped my friends child when they were colic if that's an option for you!", "NTA. Some people like that woman are just irritating, entitled twats. Babies cry, it happens. You carry on taking her for walks and being a great Dad.", "Tell her to fight you or to STFU\n\nNTA", "NTA. Looks to me you are being the best dad you can be. Going through the usual and checking off the childs needs for whats causing the crying .  Your outside in the public no one should dictate if you should stay in cause the noise from the crying . The walks are soothing for the baby and if they work it works and everyone gets some fresh air. Plus its a form of bonding time which doesn't have to stop once the crying has phased out and can be something for yall throughout the childs life plus im sure the pupper wouldn't disagree. All i can can say is maybe the lady needs more practice on her yoga skill to drown out any outside disturbances.", "NTA  even your pediatrician would say you did the right thing. When my son would get this way teething his Dr always said to check for everything OP did and if they still are crying take them outside or give them a bath and those things always worked with him still do when he's crabby at 4 years old", "NTA. Babies cry. It\u2019s literally one of the main things they do (alongside eat, sleep and poop). If you took your crying baby into a crowded restaurant you would be inflicting that noise on a bunch of people who couldn\u2019t escape it without abandoning their lunch so you would be TA. But in a public park, you\u2019re fine.", "Um\u2026 could the lady possibly have been talking about your dog? Lmfao \u201cseen not heard\u201d ma\u2019am it\u2019s a baby\u2026", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not listen to the crazies.", "Nobody wants to listen to a baby cry, this is true.  It's also a known hazard of being outdoors in public places that you might not always have the perfect environment.  Personally I wouldn't have cared to see your dog crapping while I was trying to do yoga, but you weren't wrong for doing that either as you scooped the poop.  Lady sounds quite precious and you are NTA.", "Nta that\u2019s an outdoor place for people she doesn\u2019t own it. CM so petty I would show up after that every time the baby cried.", "NTA at all! It\u2019s a public space, and your child is allowed to exist in it. If walking her around helps, then so be it. If anyone gives you trouble for it, simply point out that it\u2019s a public space and your child is allowed to exist in it.", "NTA", "I hate the sound of crying babies and would probably personally be irritated if I heard your baby...but I also know that is 100% my issue and that babies deserve to exist in public just as much as I do and i would just go on with my day. You did nothing wrong and you're unequivocally NTA. That woman needs to chill. Or just stay in her own house 24/7 where other people can't bother her.", "NTA, sometimes the baby needs a walk or a ride in the car to calm down. You can't \"train\" a baby to be seen and not heard, that's ridiculous.", "I cant see why you would be TA. You were trying to soothe your child and take care of your pet at the same time. If you just so happened to pass a yoga group then that's simply how it worked out. It doesn't sound like you planned to interrupt them. But accidental interruptions happen and I think they should have been more understanding.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a public place. You did nothing wrong", "NTA, i'm 21 F but not ready for a baby yet and you being able to care for one at 20 and know how to handle a baby and found a way to soothe her...damn you have my respect!! I'm proud of you being a good dad!!\n\nBesides...public spaces means noise. There is no way to not expect a baby to not cry. The lady is entitled. She cannot demand absolute silence in a public space.\n\nYour mom is also the butthole. Sure people rather not hear a baby cry but they won't complain as its natural. Babies cry all the time. People are happy as soon the baby laughs as its heartmelting.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA \n\nAs everyone else said babies cry and it\u2019s a public park. \n\nSide note have you tried gripe water or gas drops.  She\u2019s probably swallowing a lot of air when she cries which makes her tummy hurt so she cries more and swallows more air. The gripe water helps get little bubbles into one big bubble that is easier to bring up. The stuff saved my sanity with my last 2 kids.", "NTA. The best way to calm a cranky baby is to take him/her for a walk outside. When our son was little my husband actually made friends with another dad with the same problem. I now walk our grandson outside when he is cranky, looking at trees works like a charm for him.\n\nYou just ran into a cranky adult, ignore the person, you did nothing wrong.", "I agree 100%.\n\nI'm childfree, and not a kid person, baby's don't interest me at all.\n\nSeveral times over the last year our neighbour has been walking around our street at all hours, including late at night, with their crying baby.\n\nAll I said to my partner was \"poor parents, that must be so stressful for them.\"\n\nBabies cry, that's what they do. I've never understood why people get offended by it. It's not like the baby is shouting profanities, or questioning my parentage!", "Last time I encountered that was in Little House on the Prairie", "NTA. Currently teething at my house as well. Have you tried putting some toys in the freezer for her? You can get ones with water inside that freeze but if you don\u2019t have those, even the solid plastic Sophie the giraffe cooled down seems to help.", "How was he going to do that when the dog starter pooping? He\u2019s indeed NTA. And honestly, as long as people are outside, they should be mindful of street noise. A crying baby is part of that, whether we like it or not. Attitude like the one that woman showed is what\u2019s wrong with our world.", "Sorry, but if you are doing yoga in a public space you have to share it with the public, and that includes babies."]}
