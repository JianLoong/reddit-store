Maybe the lady needs to up her yoga classes - she doesn\u2019t sound very chilled out to me", "NTA If this person was practiced in meditation and yoga, they would have been able to calm down\u2026 Sounds like she needs a few more sessions\u2026 And the fact that she was dragged away by the other attendees shows you\u2019re clearly not the asshole here, And obviously the only reason you were stopped and not continuing past them was to pick up dog poop\u2026 That was certainly something you needed to do and be responsible for.", "Yes, children crying is ubiquitous in its displeasure, but that doesnt mean you cant go out for a walk of in public because of the crying.

You'd tried to soothe her, run through other options, and settled on a walk.  You were in shared public space, which comes with no noise protection against crying babies.  You were even doing your civic duty cleaning up after your dog!!  The woman who approached you was totally the AH.  No six month old baby can be taught to be seen and not heard.

Even more so for thinking they *should* be trained to be 'seen but not heard.' \n\nHowever, I will say that it would have polite if you had changed your walking route once you noticed the meditation/yoga group, if possible. Meditation is supposed to be calming and a crying baby isn't. So, NTA for the walk, but perhaps a little bit rude for your chosen path.", "NTA\n\nIts a public, outdoor space.

If she had left you alone you would have walked away even sooner. That lady sounds unhinged.", "NTA - You're right, nobody likes to hear a baby cry. That's why you walk rather than sit.", "NTA! I\u2019m not a parent, so correct me if this isn\u2019t common. I always thought taking a baby on a walk or on a short car ride is a way to soothe them. You couldn\u2019t help where the dog pooped and bagging up the poop takes what 30 seconds max? Like I\u2019m sure if they are outside other noises like big trucks and children playing are common distractions. So weird!", "Well forget Grandma watching the baby, she'll admonish it or worse for crying.  IF you had sat down by the yoga class and stayed for the entirety, then sure, but stopping for 90 seconds to clean up after your dog, you are NTA.", "NTA. Isn\u2019t the point of meditation to focus through the distractions?  Assuming that this yoga class was held outside in a park?

You might ask your pediatrician about using Tylenol or Advil to help ease her pain--it made a huge difference with my kids.", "NTA Babies cry and the yoga tyrant will get over it. I've got 3 kids and I know things can seem so stressful. I can't imagine doing it alone so you're doing great to even be considering these things. It gets better, easier, you'll get some rest eventually. Right now you may feel like a zombie but the day will come when you realize you're well rested. You'll even start to miss the baby times. It's all part of the journey.", "NTA and omg the audacity of entitled people. Babies exist. People cry. You did nothing wrong. And you are right that oftentimes a walk in a carrier will help a fussy baby to settle. Good thinking, Dad.

Like, not even fucking close. \"Seen and not heard\"?? Fuck that. That shit is why I'm in therapy now as an adult. As a dad with a toddler, you did exactly the right thing to help your kiddo. Everyone else in this story sucks for clinging to outdated and harmful methods of childcare. Adults can regulate and put up with some crying for a few minutes, or at least, they should be able to. If they can't, then they are the ones who don't belong in public. Yoga lady was an AH and your mom needs to get with the times and be more supportive of her grandchild. Kids are people too and their emotions are just as valid as ours. It's not their fault they have limited ways to express it yet.", "Totally NTA.  That is a public space.  What if an emergency happened?  Was that person going to go and tell the first responder to have the emergency somewhere else because a yoga class was being held?  That was a bad move on their part, because if a session needs quiet, then they should be in a space where they can control the environment.  Anything can happen. Construction/ Accident/ Police chase... was she going to yell at everyone that disturbed their serenity?  NTA.", "How early? Screeching kids make the worst noise, but that lady sounds a bit deranged. \n\nYou taking your shrieking child out to share the noise with the neighbourhood instead of containing it to your house could be seen as obnoxious though, yeah.\n\nMight want to make sure the kid doesn\u2019t have acid reflux or anything.", "NTA shame on that woman and a curse on her cow. You are doing such amazing work just surviving these early months! Put them in water or go outside is what I was advised. You are doing a great job Dad! Keep it up! Don't let her comment get to you and instead read all these comments of support!", "Nta at all. It's a public space and kids of all ages make noise. A chiropractor really helped my friends child when they were colic if that's an option for you!", "NTA. Some people like that woman are just irritating, entitled twats. Babies cry, it happens. You carry on taking her for walks and being a great Dad.", "Tell her to fight you or to STFU\n\nNTA", "NTA. Looks to me you are being the best dad you can be. Going through the usual and checking off the childs needs for whats causing the crying .  Your outside in the public no one should dictate if you should stay in cause the noise from the crying . The walks are soothing for the baby and if they work it works and everyone gets some fresh air. Plus its a form of bonding time which doesn't have to stop once the crying has phased out and can be something for yall throughout the childs life plus im sure the pupper wouldn't disagree. All i can can say is maybe the lady needs more practice on her yoga skill to drown out any outside disturbances.", "NTA  even your pediatrician would say you did the right thing. When my son would get this way teething his Dr always said to check for everything OP did and if they still are crying take them outside or give them a bath and those things always worked with him still do when he's crabby at 4 years old", "NTA. Babies cry. It\u2019s literally one of the main things they do (alongside eat, sleep and poop). If you took your crying baby into a crowded restaurant you would be inflicting that noise on a bunch of people who couldn\u2019t escape it without abandoning their lunch so you would be TA. But in a public park, you\u2019re fine.", "Um\u2026 could the lady possibly have been talking about your dog?

It's also a known hazard of being outdoors in public places that you might not always have the perfect environment.

Lady sounds quite precious and you are NTA.", "Nta that\u2019s an outdoor place for people she doesn\u2019t own it. CM so petty I would show up after that every time the baby cried.", "NTA at all! It\u2019s a public space, and your child is allowed to exist in it. If walking her around helps, then so be it.

You did nothing wrong and you're unequivocally NTA. That woman needs to chill. Or just stay in her own house 24/7 where other people can't bother her.", "NTA, sometimes the baby needs a walk or a ride in the car to calm down. You can't \"train\" a baby to be seen and not heard, that's ridiculous.", "I cant see why you would be TA. You were trying to soothe your child and take care of your pet at the same time. If you just so happened to pass a yoga group then that's simply how it worked out. It doesn't sound like you planned to interrupt them. But accidental interruptions happen and I think they should have been more understanding.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a public place. You did nothing wrong", "NTA, i'm 21 F but not ready for a baby yet and you being able to care for one at 20 and know how to handle a baby and found a way to soothe her...damn you have my respect!! I'm proud of you being a good dad!!\n\nBesides...public spaces means noise. There is no way to not expect a baby to not cry. The lady is entitled. She cannot demand absolute silence in a public space.\n\nYour mom is also the butthole. Sure people rather not hear a baby cry but they won't complain as its natural. Babies cry all the time. People are happy as soon the baby laughs as its heartmelting.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA \n\nAs everyone else said babies cry and it\u2019s a public park. \n\nSide note have you tried gripe water or gas drops.  She\u2019s probably swallowing a lot of air when she cries which makes her tummy hurt so she cries more and swallows more air. The gripe water helps get little bubbles into one big bubble that is easier to bring up. The stuff saved my sanity with my last 2 kids.", "NTA. The best way to calm a cranky baby is to take him/her for a walk outside. When our son was little my husband actually made friends with another dad with the same problem. I now walk our grandson outside when he is cranky, looking at trees works like a charm for him.\n\nYou just ran into a cranky adult, ignore the person, you did nothing wrong.", "I agree 100%.\n\nI'm childfree, and not a kid person, baby's don't interest me at all.\n\nSeveral times over the last year our neighbour has been walking around our street at all hours, including late at night, with their crying baby.\n\nAll I said to my partner was \"poor parents, that must be so stressful for them.\"\n\nBabies cry, that's what they do. I've never understood why people get offended by it. It's not like the baby is shouting profanities, or questioning my parentage!", "Last time I encountered that was in Little House on the Prairie", "NTA. Currently teething at my house as well. Have you tried putting some toys in the freezer for her? You can get ones with water inside that freeze but if you don\u2019t have those, even the solid plastic Sophie the giraffe cooled down seems to help.", "How was he going to do that when the dog starter pooping? He\u2019s indeed NTA. And honestly, as long as people are outside, they should be mindful of street noise. A crying baby is part of that, whether we like it or not. Attitude like the one that woman showed is what\u2019s wrong with our world.", "Sorry, but if you are doing yoga in a public space you have to share it with the public, and that includes babies.", "NTA. I would gather there with friends who also have young kids just to be petty and when she starts complaining I would complain about nobody wanting to see her in yoga pants either.", "NTA - I'm not saying you should have thrown the poop at her, but I'd have understood...", "Nta, sometimes walking mine in the pram was the only thing that helped.\n\nGive bicycle legs a try as well and rubbing tummy anti clockwise/tummy massage", "NTA. That other person is a complete jerk.", "NTA! Babies cry. We were all babies, and we all cried. Many times, there is nothing one can do to calm a crying baby. Sounds like meditation is not doing much for the complaining woman.", "I\u2019m so sick of people not wanting children to exist in public", "This just sounds so utterly fake.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA- if you're having a hard time with teething, frizen bananas are a great way to help. They just need 3-4 hours in the freezer, so they're cold enough, but still soft enough to ease the pain. \n\nJust make sure there are no allergies. If baby doesn't like bananas, almost frozen peaches or pears work, too. You just have to watch that they don't get too hard.", "NTA, yoga lady doesn\u2019t own the public space? The audacity and entitlement is unreal. You and your child have every right to be out in public even when she\u2019s fussy. I hate the idea that people with kids have to be locked in the house all day. Go outside. If it was me, I\u2019d be walking her twice as often, directly around their yoga bs.", "NTA. Side note : Hey bro, are you okay? Do you have a support network? \nDon't worry, you'll get the hang of it, and time flies too fast.", "I know you are asking about whether you are Ta (you are NTA btw) but something I found really works for my baby girl (who is also not at all a fan of teethers) - we use a piece of ice in a mesh feeder. She likes it because it numbs her gums (after the initial oh my God this is cold!). You can also talk to her pediatrician about starting infant Tylenol (I'm aware it says no before 2 years old, but our pediatrician allowed a small amount starting at 5 months due to teething and severe gas pain (lactose intolerance of course)). If your baby DOES have gas issues, I've found enfamil gentlease neuropro to be the BEST formula for that. \n\nGood luck and feel free to reach out, I love talking with new parents and learning new things together!", "NTA. Your baby isn\u2019t supposed to cry, but that looney tune can stop meditation to yell at you? Nope. Her compadres ushering her away says it all.", "I assume you'll now take her for a walk by this area daily now? NTA OP.", "NTA. I\u2019d go back for their next meet up and let her exercise her lungs. Pfft!", "NTA\n\nI would've said, \"Sorry to disturb you, we're going... here's a bag to pick up the dog poop\"", "Your mom and that woman need to \"lock it up and stop projecting\"", "That lady should be seen and not heard. WTF? NTA", "NTA - seriously? Lol cmon man.", "NTA.  When my oldest was colicky, the old wives tale of running the vacuum cleaner worked like a charm.  Downside is I really had to crank the TV to hear it over the vacuum cleaner.  My neighbors must have loved that.", "What on earth??? My parents tell me all the time that either walking with me or driving was the only way to get me to calm down sometimes. I\u2019m days away from delivering my own baby and I wonder if I\u2019ll be doing the same soon. Keep doing you, Dad! NTA", "No one wants a baby to cry. You should have told her if she can calm a colicky baby, feel free to do it. Nosey people irk me.

That lady should not be allowed in public.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSurely no one loves hearing a baby crying or in pain, but sometimes it's inevitable, and YOU WERE TRYING YOUR BEST! \"Seen not heard\" is such bs..", "NTA! Children should be seen and not heard is some antiquated bullshit. You\u2019re a good dad you did what you needed to do to sooth a crying baby. I feel bad for the members of that Yoga class that had to try and sooth a grown ass woman acting like a child. The baby had an excuse what\u2019s hers?", "NTA. you were outside. outside can be noisy. and you weren't standing gazing at the yoga class, you stopped briefly to clean up after your dog. \nWould this person go to a firetruck and yell at them for having their siren on?", "NTA. It sounds like you're doing a decent job!", "I would\u2019ve responded with \u201capparently your parents didn\u2019t do that with you, given that you\u2019re over here being heard and not seen\u201d.", "NTA, and frozen watermelon works great as a teether.", "NTA\n\nSounds like that woman never learned to be in public. Someone should really train her", "Definitely nta, you were just trying to get her to calm down", "NTA\nYoga lady wasn't doing it right if screaming at neighbors is her response to a baby crying outdoors. She was rude to harrass you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a public outdoor area. Babies cry. Like, as a person who gets a migraine from babies crying nearly every time, I wouldn\u2019t be put out by this. Babies have the right to exist too", "NTA and who cares what they said. You do you. Glad your baby slept!", "NTA.\n\nIt's a public space. You and your child have as much right to occupy as they do. \n\nSide note: my kids loved to chew on frozen washcloths, I think it was the texture. It doesn't HAVE to be an actual branded teether as long as it's safe. Also the white teething tablets (Hylands brand, I think they still sell them) helped my kiddos a lot. Best of luck getting through this stage. It doesn't usually last long.", "NTA\n\nWondering what your childhood was like if that\u2019s your mothers\u2019s view.\n\nYou took your baby out in public, the bloody fresh air and not into a mediation studio.\n\nSometimes my youngest just needed some fresh air and he\u2019d calm down when nothing else worked.\n \nThat lady needs to learn to control herself if she flips out because a baby cries. The yoga/meditation is obviously not helping.", "NTA, I work with kids of all ages and the fact is that babies cry. nobody enjoys being around a crying baby in public, but they have just as much of a right to be in public as anyone else.", "It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re taking a crying baby into a movie theater or the quiet part of the library but you were just out enjoying the sunshine NTA", "Nta.walking with your child is the best way to keep yourself and baby calm and happy. I'm sorry this person ruined your walk. People can be child free but they have no right to police babies in public spaces", "NTA.\n\nTell them yoga will do nothing if they can't even have a bit of patience. \n\nHaving patience is really important. You can zone out exterior noise when practising yoga. Otherwise, tell them to go to outskirts of the city/town to practise it.", "NTA, teething is awful for babies and you did the right thing by taking them for a walk, obviously, since it seemed to soothe them. That woman shouldn't be seen OR heard. How does she expect a tiny baby to regulate its emotions when she seems more than incapable of the same thing.", "NTA. Of course no one wants to hear a crying baby, but we live in a society where people need to have babies. No parent is making a baby cry intentionally and outdoor air helps often. Sorry people are assholes, just ignore.", "NTA. Do the yogaidiots tell traffic to quiet down? Kudos to you for making your baby feel better.  And tell grandma she\u2019s borderline TA. imo.", "NTA. It\u2019s a BABY! They cry and do things when you don\u2019t expect it. Expecting a baby to be Seen and not heard makes me laugh. Live your life!!!", "NTA that lady needs to meditate some more and chill the f out", "NTA.  The woman who confronted you is deranged.", "NTA...no question. You did all the right things. This lady is certifiable, as evidenced by her classmates walking her away. As for your mom, shame on her for making you question your decisions as a parent.  Taking your fussy baby on a walk is one of the things to do when all else is fine (food, burp, diaper, etc...) your baby is over tired and uncomfortable, if she wasn't crying that would be a rare thing. You seem to be doing fine, this stage is hell but will get better. Try to nap when the baby naps.", "Ugh, NTA. That lady needs to calm down. \"Seen and not heard\"? How old was she, 65+? lmao", "NTA. Next time, fling the poop at them.", "NTA.  You\u2019re doing great.

After all, she is six months, not six weeks - half a year should be enough time to learn how to behave properly. \n\nYes - that it's sarcasm (which hopefully most would realize) \ud83d\ude01 - it's ridiculous of her to say that and the whole seen and not heard thing is just stupid. \n\nYou are allowed to leave your house and go for a walk.

They put a laundry basket on the top, put me in it and put stuff in front of the basket so I wouldn't fall off. The vibration calmed me down and I slept well after that, and my parents had very clean clothes for 5 months lol. I think they make those little swings that vibrate too if you don't want to try a dryer lol. Good luck!
