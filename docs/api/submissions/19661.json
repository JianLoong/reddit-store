I\u2019m a 20year old single dad of an almost six month old baby who is currently colicky/teething/cries a lot lately (she was an angel durring the newborn stage but now is not). \n\nEarlier this morning she was of course, crying a whole lot, and I checked everything. 8oz of formula, down and burped really well as. Diaper dry and not poopy, no rash at all. Clothes not too warm, not too cold. Teethers don\u2019t help, not that they ever did, as for some reason she HATES all teethers. The dog wasn\u2019t even helping to cheer her up and normally that works mostly like a charm. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that sometimes she will calm down when I\u2019m on a brisk walk and well my dog needed to go out so in the carrier she goes. We leave on our walk. \n\nAbout ten minutes in Ruby (my dog) goes poop and I\u2019m getting ready to bag it. We are near a meditation/yoga class. One of the members of said class comes running up and yells at me for not controlling my daughter and training her to be seen and not heard. That she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to in public when she\u2019s like this. I told her to back off and other members from the group came over and led her away. \n\nI bagged up the poop and we went on our way.

You\u2019re NTA! If you are in a public space people cannot tell you to be quiet. You also can\u2019t predict where your dog is going to poop. At least you are a good person to clean it up. You should have thrown it at the lady. Lol. But NTA. Do what you gotta do to calm down your child. Those people\u2019s feelings don\u2019t necessarily matter.

Babies cry, you were being responsible for checking her and took her for a walk to calm her down.  The other woman was out of line", "NTA babies love being walked & is a very good idea - you both get some fresh air, in your case the dog also got walked & the baby is now sleeping. Maybe the lady needs to up her yoga classes - she doesn\u2019t sound very chilled out to me", "NTA If this person was practiced in meditation and yoga, they would have been able to calm down\u2026 Sounds like she needs a few more sessions\u2026 And the fact that she was dragged away by the other attendees shows you\u2019re clearly not the asshole here, And obviously the only reason you were stopped and not continuing past them was to pick up dog poop\u2026 That was certainly something you needed to do and be responsible for.", "Yes, children crying is ubiquitous in its displeasure, but that doesnt mean you cant go out for a walk of in public because of the crying. Kindergarden/pre-school run based wholeheartedly on that premise. \nNTA.", "??? NTA, you\u2019re trying everything you can to help your baby. Good for you.", "NTA.  Crying babies are a fact of life.  You'd tried to soothe her, run through other options, and settled on a walk.  You were in shared public space, which comes with no noise protection against crying babies.  You were even doing your civic duty cleaning up after your dog!!  The woman who approached you was totally the AH.  No six month old baby can be taught to be seen and not heard.  I'm sure the other members of her group were embarrassed by her.", "> One of the members of said class comes running up and yells at me for not controlling my daughter and training her to be seen and not heard.

Humans of all ages make sounds.  Perhaps that lady is in need of a more rural experience.", "NTA. its a public area. noise are to be expected every now and then.", "TA wasn't you, but the dumbass thinking a 6mo baby could be 'trained' to do anything at all. Even more so for thinking they *should* be trained to be 'seen but not heard.' \n\nHowever, I will say that it would have polite if you had changed your walking route once you noticed the meditation/yoga group, if possible. Meditation is supposed to be calming and a crying baby isn't. So, NTA for the walk, but perhaps a little bit rude for your chosen path.", "NTA\n\nIts a public, outdoor space.  The women that yelled at you for not \"controlling\" your 6 month old babe is certifiably insane.  \n\nGo ahead and take your baby for a walk even if she is crying.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "Nobody wants to listen to a baby cry, but i'd never go tell a parent to \"train her to be seen and not heard\". It's a bloody baby, it's what they do. Furthermore, i don't want their yoga classes in my public spaces, but i don't go tell them to f\\*\\*\\* off (i hate gym classes and their lousy speakers most). NTA", "NTA. \u201cSeen not heard\u201d??? That\u2019s some Silent Generation bs. It\u2019s not like you walked her into a studio.", "NTA and what the heck is wrong with your Mom? Babies get to exist in public. That means sometimes they cry. Shame on your Mom (and that lady).", "NTA your daughter is allowed to be a baby in a public space. And you\u2019re walking! If she had left you alone you would have walked away even sooner. That lady sounds unhinged.", "NTA - You're right, nobody likes to hear a baby cry. That's why you walk rather than sit."]}
