Today though, she said she wanted to come along so I bought her a pickaxe and we decided to go mining. When we were mining, she dug up some green rock that was worth absolutely nothing. She was excited and asked me what it was so I, as a joke, told her \u201choly shit that\u2019s a leaverite\u201d. She was supposed to ask me what a leaverite was for the joke but she didn\u2019t. She took a picture of it and posted it on her instagram story with the caption \u201cI found this beautiful leaverite \ud83e\udd70\u201d. I didn\u2019t know that until later when we were done but when I saw it I started laughing my ass off and told her that it was worth nothing and she was flexing a worthless piece of rock.

Since we're laughing at silly word usage.", "Rocks don't have to have value to be seen as pretty", "YTA well you just guaranteed she will never show an interest in anything you do ever again. You completely shat all over something that should have been a great shared experience and belittled her at the same time.", "YTA the only way that joke would work is if you said both parts together. Why would your gf ask you what leaverite is when according to you she had one in her hands? You tried to make a henweigh joke and failed out of the gate.", "YTA. Your girlfriend expresses an interest in joining you on your hobby and all you can do is mock her for being a newb?", "YTA. Seriously why do you think it is a joke if the other person has no idea that you are joking. She seriously thought that you also thought the rock she found was cool.", "Yup YTA. The thing about a joke is both sides have to find it funny and you have to deliver the punchline. BTW I\u2019m pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t have found it funny anyway because I bet all she cared about was that she found something pretty while spending time with you, not if it\u2019s worth anything. BUT bottom line is you didn\u2019t finish your joke and as such she was trusting you were serious because of that. Now she can\u2019t trust what you say and you caused her to look and feel dumb because you laughed in her face at her expense for a joke you didn\u2019t finish.

If someone doesn't get the joke, you explain it to them at that time. You don't go on and let them think you were being helpful and truthful. That was a jerk move.

Great job.", "YTA. But get this as the end of your joke. You just blew her trust in you. \n\n After you did this to your own girlfriend will she or anyone believe you about the rocks you have found?

Good job.", "I mean your not an ah for playing a prank but just remember that your girlfriend took an active interest in one of your hobbies and you made her feel like an idiot for it, so maybe don't be surprised when your gf continues to not want to come", "YTA. she was making an effort to get to know you and be closer to you, and you made her feel stupid. i doubt she'll make that mistake again.", "YTA.

Why is that?\n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t matter what the value of the rock was, it was probably the first rock that she found while doing a hobby that you loved for the first time, and that says a lot if you think of rock like that is worthless that says a lot about you.", "Yta - I'm surprised you didn't tell her it was a joke within 30 seconds.
