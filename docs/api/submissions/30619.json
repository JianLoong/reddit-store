This was to be a short term (under 6mo) arrangement. At the time she had a full time job but 1.5 months in she quit abruptly. She is drinking all day long and is regularly drunk around myself and my children. I am a sober, recovering alcoholic so I\u2019m struggling with this. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t come home or is coming/going weird hours. She has even brought strangers back home for sex. I told her I didn\u2019t mind as this was her home, but asked her not to when my 2 young children (both under 5) were home. She also allegedly has been looking for a job but hasn\u2019t found one and from what I see isn\u2019t putting in any effort to find employment.\n\nI had made it clear that I was becoming increasingly upset with this arrangement in a very kind and calm manner. My sister can have an explosive attitude and I love her and didn\u2019t want our relationship to deteriorate. I gently brought up moving out and she expressed difficulty because she was now unemployed. I offered to help her co-sign a lease once she secured new employment and showed she could afford rent and suggested she ask our mom for help with a security deposit (I had talked to her and she agreed she would help.) She seemed relatively agreeable and we determined January-February would be a good time.\n\nThat was good until yesterday. Downstairs in the basement was a desk of mine. I needed to move it upstairs as my work schedule recently switched to hybrid. I don\u2019t go down there much and seldom do I look around, because to be frank, my sister and I live in very different conditions. When I went to clear off the desk (with her permission) I was appalled. There was old food, beverages, cat litter and other unidentifiable grime all over this. How this had built up in only 3 months time is beyond me. It was crazy to me. I cleaned it off and moved it upstairs but I was furious. I started to look around and just saw filth everywhere. \n\nI took some time to calm down and then texted her to let her know that I had decided the best decision for our relationship and my mental health was for her to move out as soon as possible. I explained I would still help secure her an apartment, that I wouldn\u2019t charge her any more rent (it was only $300 to begin with) and I would even help with a security deposit or talking to our parents for monetary assistance. But that ultimately, December had to be the last full month she was there. She\u2019s been staying with a friend a lot lately too so I also assumed she could ask this person to rent a room/move in briefly (they have 2 other roommates). Basically- between myself, our parents and her friends, my sister will not end up homeless. \n\nShe is furious claiming that I don\u2019t care about her and that I \u201cfucked her over\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t care about her well being.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be calm and acknowledge I\u2019m unhappy in my own home but between her and my mom I\u2019m starting to feel bad.

You set rules for your sister and she didn't seem to follow them. Add in the conditions you found the basement in.\n\nDo not cosign anything for her. That will bite you in the ass.\n\nOne last thing; since she has been living there for so long she may have rights that could keep you from kicking her out.

Even if youre justified in asking her to leave, it's possible that by accepting rent, you have created a legal sublease and she'll need to be legally served with eviction papers or other procedures followed to ensure she doesnt make some claim against you. \n\nI don't know what the chances are of her contesting you in a legal manner on this, but just in case, you may wish to consult a lawyer or free legal aid at a local law library, law school, or the like.

The second she had you under thumb she quit her job so she could focus on the thing she loves most; drinking. You would be dangerously naive to think she will suddenly get back on the wagon if you are on the hook for her apartment. \n\nAs long as she has a safety net then she will leech as much as she can. I think you know this but are trying to convince yourself that she will be different. She won\u2019t be. I know you said in comments that you go to meetings so maybe think about swinging by a al-anon meeting. It\u2019s for family and loved ones of alcoholics. \n\nYour responsibility is to yourself and your children. She comes after that and getting on the hook to potentially pay her entire lease would be taking funds away from children. She is gonna have to sink or swim. You can\u2019t drown yourself trying to hold her head above water.", "Thank you!! I have offered several times to take her to meetings, or to talk about it but she does not believe that she has a problem and that she is having \u201cfun\u201d.

I feel like I needed Reddit to give it to me straight and say stuff like this.

I have to think long and hard about what you said, but thank you, I appreciate you.", "This. Don't cosign anything at all.", "I was about to write the same thing! Nothing good will come out of co-signing a lease. \n\nShe is unemployed, irresponsible, and possibly abusing alcohol (not diagnosing). She is desperate and will say anything to manipulate you into giving her what she wants. She has proven that she can\u2019t be trusted right now, and allowing her to stay threatens your sobriety, your safety and your children\u2019s wellbeing. I know it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s ok to put yourself first. Good luck!", "Thank you so much!! 6.5 years in and feel super grateful!! Appreciate your comment", "She is definitely too proud. She would tell you that she doesn\u2019t have a problem and that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about her current living conditions. She is resistant to care and also hyper independent so most likely once this ends she won\u2019t communicate with me for months on end, unfortunately.", "If you want your sister to get better, you need to stop enabling her.\n\nShe's going to have to have consequences before she realizes she has a problem.\n\nIf she has to couch surf or be stuck in a homeless shelter for a while to get her head on straight that's what is going to take. She's not going to get better if you continue to buffer her from consequences.", "Oh okay then your parts done for sure, I mean one can just guide you, it\u2019s upon her to get through it even if path\u2019s harsh. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Or fortunately."]}
