The truth is it is even safer now than it was back when free range parenting was the thing.  Kids are much more likely to be abused or molested by someone they know than by a stranger.  It isn\u2019t a big deal to let your kid run around the neighborhood so long as appropriate distances are enforced.  When I was 10 and under, I had to stay within visual sight of the house.

If they knew where I was, I could stay at a friends house as late as they would let me.  They didn\u2019t care if parents were present or not, so long as they could reach me or I could reach them.\n\nMy parents would likely get CPS called on them nowadays, even though it is now safer for those things than it used to be.", "My parents probably would have also. We were often home alone since both my parents worked. I agree that it's much safer now since cell phones weren't a thing when I was kid.
