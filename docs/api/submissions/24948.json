Your sister is a family member doing you a favor, not a paid employee, so she\u2019s allowed to enforce her own set of rules when she\u2019s responsible for your daughter. \n\nFor example, if your daughter said she wanted to go hang out with a friend and your sister denied it, I\u2019d agree with your sister.
