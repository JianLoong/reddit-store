She has a lease, which is a contract. You have child support, which is in essence a contract. It's not up to her to dictate what you do with the rent payments, just like it's (to an extent) not up to you to dictate what she does with child support. I'm sure she would've thrown a fit if you stopped paying child support because \"your basically paying yourself rent\". Her argument is ridiculous. You gave her chances to pay her rent, and she was taking full advantage of your relationship thinking she was protected because of the kids.", "So wait, out of 2 men she has 4 children fulltime? Am I understanding this correctly?", "NTA. Your house, your decision to sell.", "NTA. It is your house and she has a lease and is refusing to pay rent. You could have just evicted her but selling the house seems like the best move for you.", "I understand the thought and in the current financial climate, who can blame you for covering your own losses?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I do think that selling the house your own two children lived in to make a point is rather harsh and I'm sure they'll grow up to remember it.", "NTA - you didnt do this out of spite, you simply couldnt afford it", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe her shelter. She and you are no longer together, and short of supporting your own kids you aren't required to run a charity and support her extended family. It might be a bit cold sure, but then again let the people who insist on you \"Being a man\" and \"showing kindness to her children and her situation\" open their wallets and pay their support.", "Noooope,NTA. You got out of a conflict of interest, and you had no reason to believe it would be to her detriment.", "NTA - she is an adult, she needs to deal with the world like everybody else. Unless you agreed on providing her with a place to stay, you do not have to look after her housing. I would be inclined to say you were an asshole if you would have put her out in the street just like that, but the fact that you let her stay in your place for free for all these months tells me you tried to do the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour responsibility towards your children\u00b4s housing is covered in the alimony you pay her, as per the agreement of the divorce. She seems to be unable to take responsibility on her end, however.   \n\n\nShe is an adult, she has responsibilities just like you do, and there are consequences to your actions and inactions. If there were circumstances that would require more of your generosity past those 5 months, she could have told you but instead she told you she thought it was unfair.  \n\n\nLife is unfair, she has to suck it up like the rest of us and take ownership and responsibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you kids are really homeless, perhaps you can offer them to stay at yours (only the kids of course)?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just make sure you work on getting primary custody of your own kids if she can't find a cheap place to live.

It's not harsh when he's doing so because 1) the mum stopped paying rent and 2) he can't afford to fund two houses by himself plus the child support he has to pay. Usually if you skip 5 months rent you get evicted. If he can't afford both house payments he risks losing both houses and then they're all screwed, he did the sensible thing and she's not exactly homeless given she has a lease and long enough to find a new place if she needs it. If you can't afford something you can't afford it, it's on her not paying that he had to sell it. The kids will be able to understand that when they're old enough.", "I don't see it as making a point, op could not afford to keep it.", "I agree. You're within your rights to do it, but the stress of being in an unstable housing situation can do a number on a child's mental health.", "This right here.  Your actions have not changed at all.  You pay her what you owe her.  She still have the same house to live in, under the same lease, at the same rent.  She just can't steal from you anymore."]}
