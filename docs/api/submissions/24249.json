She has a lease, which is a contract. You have child support, which is in essence a contract. It's not up to her to dictate what you do with the rent payments, just like it's (to an extent) not up to you to dictate what she does with child support. I'm sure she would've thrown a fit if you stopped paying child support because \"your basically paying yourself rent\". Her argument is ridiculous. You gave her chances to pay her rent, and she was taking full advantage of your relationship thinking she was protected because of the kids.", "So wait, out of 2 men she has 4 children fulltime? Am I understanding this correctly?", "NTA. Your house, your decision to sell.", "NTA. It is your house and she has a lease and is refusing to pay rent. You could have just evicted her but selling the house seems like the best move for you.", "I understand the thought and in the current financial climate, who can blame you for covering your own losses?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I do think that selling the house your own two children lived in to make a point is rather harsh and I'm sure they'll grow up to remember it.", "NTA - you didnt do this out of spite, you simply couldnt afford it", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe her shelter. She and you are no longer together, and short of supporting your own kids you aren't required to run a charity and support her extended family. It might be a bit cold sure, but then again let the people who insist on you \"Being a man\" and \"showing kindness to her children and her situation\" open their wallets and pay their support.", "Noooope,NTA. You got out of a conflict of interest, and you had no reason to believe it would be to her detriment.", "NTA - she is an adult, she needs to deal with the world like everybody else. Unless you agreed on providing her with a place to stay, you do not have to look after her housing. I would be inclined to say you were an asshole if you would have put her out in the street just like that, but the fact that you let her stay in your place for free for all these months tells me you tried to do the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour responsibility towards your children\u00b4s housing is covered in the child support you pay her, as per the agreement of the divorce. She seems to be unable to take responsibility on her end, however.   \n\n\nShe is an adult, she has responsibilities just like you do, and there are consequences to your actions and inactions. If there were circumstances that would require more of your generosity past those 5 months, she could have told you but instead she told you she thought it was unfair.  \n\n\nLife is unfair, she has to suck it up like the rest of us and take ownership and responsibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you kids are really homeless, perhaps you can offer them to stay at yours (only the kids of course)?\n\nEdit: replaced the word alimony for child support.

She assumed that you would not evict her, which strictly speaking, you did not. What is more, nothing has changed. You still pay her child support. She still pays rent, just not to you.", "> she says is that it's unfair that she is basically paying herself child support since I use her rent for that\n\nLol she really wanted her cake and eat it too. NTA", "NTA she didn't pay rent for 5 months and it was your house to sell", "NTA - If your kids have two parents that can't make house payments, they're in trouble.  Just make sure you work on getting primary custody of your own kids if she can't find a cheap place to live.

It's not harsh when he's doing so because 1) the mum stopped paying rent and 2) he can't afford to fund two houses by himself plus the child support he has to pay. Usually if you skip 5 months rent you get evicted. If he can't afford both house payments he risks losing both houses and then they're all screwed, he did the sensible thing and she's not exactly homeless given she has a lease and long enough to find a new place if she needs it. If you can't afford something you can't afford it, it's on her not paying that he had to sell it. The kids will be able to understand that when they're old enough.", "I don't see it as making a point, op could not afford to keep it.", "I agree. You're within your rights to do it, but the stress of being in an unstable housing situation can do a number on a child's mental health.", "This right here.  Your actions have not changed at all.  You pay her what you owe her.  She still have the same house to live in, under the same lease, at the same rent.  She just can't steal from you anymore.", "NTA. As long as your children have a roof over their head, and food to eat there\u2019s no problem selling the house. Personally, I would take her to court for the back rent.", "NTA\n\nId have taken her to court for the 5 months of rent", "NTA, your being very generous by not suing for the backdated rent", "Ugh. There are\u2026 a lot of issues here. But\u2026\n\nNTA\n\nFirst, no; she\u2019s not paying herself child support. If she hadn\u2019t been paying you rent, she\u2019d have been paying it to someone else. If she didn\u2019t get the house in the divorce, then she didn\u2019t get the house.\n\nSecond, she stopped paying rent and in the current economy, I\u2019d absolutely believe you can\u2019t afford to pay both mortgages. You called her bluff.\n\nThird, you did try talking to her about it.", "NTA!  Your ex was clearly taking advantage of you and weaponizing her children.  She should be happy you were her landlord because I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t raising or going to raise the rent which is not what happens in the real world.  Your ex is now going to get a taste of the real world and realize child support is financial help while both parents raise a child not dad pays for everything", "Absolutely NTA\nShe can still live there if she pays rent.", "I don't don't see why she's upset? She didn't want her rent to pay her child support, and her now her rent goes to some landlord, and you will pay child support from a different source. \n\nNTA. What did she expect gonna happen?", "NTA.  Maybe she should have paid the rent, since she is tenant and no longer a SO.", "NTA You should sue her for the rent. She would pay it to any landlord with the money from your support. You were the landlord.", "Info: While i understand your action, how did that benefit your 2 children?", "ESH.\n\nThis should have gone through lawyers or something. She sucks for not paying rent, you suck for selling her home from under her.", "NTA.  She has to pay rent somewhere - housing is not free.", "NTA she was perfectly content to keep using you.", "YTA You are literally going to make her homeless with your children.   \n\nHow much do you know her rent will be ? \n\nWhy couldn't you sell the house to her ?\n\nWas there no other solution before doing this ?", "NTA", "Lol what was her problem? She gets child support and pays the rent with it. And gets to live in the house. Now she gets to pay market rates to someone else if she doesn't get evicted.", "NTA. Rent and child support are two separate things. You were responsible for the latter and did so. She was responsible for the former and did not. She was collecting child support from two men and decided not to pay her rent. Rather than coddle her longer, enforce an eviction proceeding, or deal with her further - you sold the house. That's a reasonable response. She has a lease, a new uninvolved landlord, and can continue to live there - perhaps not in the style she became accustomed to while spending the rent, but that's not your problem.", "She's getting away easy.\n\nIf the 8k was brought in court you could have reduced the child support and maybe even changed visitation rights. Could have sued her for the money with interest, but the pragmatic option is sometimes better I guess.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Ex broke the rental agreement, and does not seem to understand that by withholding rent she is giving herself double child support.", "I so don't get how people think. Payment for food & a roof over your head, be it a mortgage or rent, are things you HAVE to pay. It's a fact of life, you gots to pay. I'm low income & don't have a lot of money what I do have I work very hard for....but first things first, I pay the rent. I live in Canada, the idea of being homeless in the dead of winter doesn't do it for me. \n\nNTA. She needs to pay the rent.", "I so don't get how people think.

She brought this on herself.", "Child support is not the same thing as alimony.", "Life might be unfair, but her paying rent is not. It\u2019s simply fair.", "You mean the child support? There\u2019s no mention of alimony, which would be a separate thing.", "And apparently no claim on the home from the divorce.  This all seems fishy to me. Kinda like OP didn't think through all the details before making it up.", "Definitely bait, but it's not even that quality imo.", "Their dad can continue to pay child support instead of going bankrupt and homeless.

She stopped paying so now it\u2019s not her anything", "That\u2019s obviously what the commenter meant.", "Thanks, I corrected it. In my language both alimony and child support have the same translation so I never knew there was a difference. Thanks for clearing that up!", "Sorry, not a native English speaker. In my language we use the same word for both alimony and child support, so I believed the english translation covered both as well. Thanks for clearing it up!", "Lol. It\u2019s quite possible. Or the house was set up in such away as to not be subject to asset splitting upon divorce.", "Lol, fair. It\u2019s quality bait if you\u2019re tryna catch MRA sunglass guys", "The stress of op being unable to pay child support or becoming homeless would also do a number on them and would be even worse. The responsibility for everything is on the mother here.", "Yes, it's all *possible*, but it also all adds up to being very unlikely, just in a way that maximizes interactions on a post."]}
