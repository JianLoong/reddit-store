She's right, you were judging her.  If you had approached it as concern for her welfare and let her know that you were worried and thought therapy could be an option, maybe you'd be seen in a better light here.  However, by your own admission, you got irritated and lost your temper and told her she's not normal.  Why in the world would you expect her to be receptive to anything you said at that point?  She likely does need a therapist, but accusing her of not being normal, taking a shot at her physical appearance and telling her she needs mental help is going to make her retreat even more and only affirm her belief that she doesn't need people, if even the ones she's closest to - like her brother - are going to attack her and make her feel small and unaccepted because she doesn't behave the way they want her to.", "You gave it a shot, so don't beat yourself up.  NTA It seems like she has some mental illness going on, sad your mom isn't standing more by you, but it is what it is.  It might be normal for to your sister but it is far from normal.  Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder (fear of leaving your environment) that is very real.  I don't have any advice on how to get your sister to acknowledge or move forward in getting help, I would only say keep trying!  It's only going to get worse as she gets older.  Good luck!", "NTA This is not normal behavior, it\u2019s also not healthy for her because of various reasons (both psychological and physical). \n\nRegardless, you can\u2019t force her to leave her home or see a therapist. I hope in the future you try a softer approach.", "I'm going to lean towards NTA, just for the fact that she's losing touch with her support network of friends. I'd change your approach however, as you did come off judgemental.", "YTA. Addressing your concerns is fine, once. However, if this is the life she wants, you have to respect that. Making fun of her appearance was mean. She may be agoraphobic, depressed, or honestly is truly done with people. In this day and age I really can't say I blame her. Lately its more & more dangerous to go anywhere. You do owe her an apology.", "Very soft YTA, OP.  You have good intentions, but your delivery was terrible.", "Lol what a threat! She doesn't want to see ANYONE for a few months.", "YTA\n\nHere are the questions you need to ask yourself. \n1. Is she still going to work/ doing her job?\n2. Is she eating?\n3. Is she cleaning her home?\n4. Is she sleeping normally?\nIf those questions are yes. Then you need to step back. If those questions are no, then you can say  that you notice blank and are worried. \n\nPushing and nagging her are not productive. You overstepped yourself. \n\nFor you personally:\nAre you home enough to do your chores? Are you not able to sleep normally? Are you restless? Do you feel you have to get up and go all the time? If yes, YOU need counseling.", "NTA\n\nThat is indeed not normal behavior and I understand the concern. While you didn't approach it perfectly, SOMEBODY close to her should tell her or suggest to her to look closer into her behavioral changes with a mental health professional, not with the goal of changing her but to understand why she is behaving the way she is and to go from there. \n\nIt's not healthy to lack connection. It's not healthy to lack exercise. It's not healthy for most people to never go outside. Autistic and agoraphobic people are still human and humans have needs.\n\nSince she has isolated herself, no mention of even pets, that \"somebody\" pretty much just leaves you.", "Asking redditors if yta for telling someone it\u2019s not normal to leave their house, bold move lol", "YTA - live and let live.  She isn't hurting anyone or herself so what's the problem?", "YTA.\n\nLet people live their lives as they please. Maybe she is extremely introverted and/or autistic. What is normal for you may not be for her. If she isn't showing any signs of being unhappy other than not leaving her house, just let her be.\n\nAlso you insulted her appearance. So definitely YTA.", "YTA. Saying \"hey I'm concerned this may hurt your mental and emotional health, can we talk about what you are doing to stay well?\" Is one thing.  Losing your temper cause she's good with her life as it is, taking digs at her skin tone, and yelling? That's being TAH. Introverts can 100% lead a happy life with very few emotional connections. Your inability to understand them, doesn't make them wrong. It just makes you judgemental.", "YTA. You can be concerned, but this was the wrong approach. She sounds like she\u2019s on the scale of misanthropy somewhere but she\u2019s still self-sufficient with her working life and seems content. Hermits have always existed, away from society. She\u2019s a contemporary hermit.", "YTA. Your sister\u2019s lack of a social life is none of your business. It\u2019s up to her how she wants to live her life", "Yta unsolicited advice is rarely received well.", "YTA\n\nIs it normal? Idk, who is to say what normal is? Is it healthy? maybe it is, maybe it's not. But there's SO many reasons why she might not be going out, including autism or agoraphobia. I feel that your response to her comes off as judgmental and less from a place of care. Ultimately, she may never change and become a social person, and she probably feels like you don't accept her for who she is. I fear you may have (unintentionally) alienated yourself from her, and if your true concern is her being alienated from the world, you've just made that worse.", "NTA  - Not sure if she is agoraphobic or depressed but you can't force her to do anything.", "Your sister and I are a lot alike, except I do not work from home so I am forced to go out for that. YTA, let her live her life.", "YTA - I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s not suffering from a low-level depression, an anxiety disorder or from agoraphobia. I know of which I speak - I am currently unemployed and honestly, most weeks the only time I leave the house all week is to go to a weekly counseling appointment. To help her, I recommend just being dedicated to keeping in touch and visiting her when possible. You may want to express that you are concerned about her mental health and see if she might have insurance to be able to take advantage of at-home counseling via Zoom. But if she is not responsive, just let her know that you are there and that you support her.", "YTA- I\u2019m like your sister, I prefer to stay home and people as little as possible. The world has gone mad and we are comfy and safe in our homes. Just because that\u2019s not your preference doesn\u2019t mean her way of life is wrong. Is she happy? At peace? Is she showing signs of depression ie. Not showering, not enjoying things she use to, dirty surroundings? You didn\u2019t mention it so I\u2019m sure she keeps her sanctuary clean and comfortable for her. Don\u2019t yuck someone\u2019s yum because you aren\u2019t capable of understanding it.  Apologize to your sister.", "YTA - 1) you were being judgemental & pushy, and 2) it's her normal.  If it works for her, she's happy and it's not causing her mental, emotional or physical distress, what's your problem? \n\nJust because she's not living her life the way you'd live your life doesn't mean she needs to see a therapist, signed a therapist.", "YTA. While I agree with you that it\u2019s not normal and most likely not that healthy. She\u2019s old enough to make her own decisions and live the lifestyle she wants. Sounds like she\u2019s essentially a hikikomori which is her prerogative. My only concern would be if she\u2019s taking supplements and stuff to counteract the lack of sunlight.", "Y T A for your delivery only. Your message though was NTA, you're concerned for her health as you should be. She's clearly depressed or agoraphobic, and either way needs addressing. Therapy was a good suggestion, but you need to be gentler next time. She's obviously sensitive about it.", "YTA, even though I could understand this being a concern for welfare. If you take into account everything going on in this messed up world (especially if you live in the US) it's pretty understandable to not want to leave the house.", "NAH - you were concerned- sister didn't want to be talk to like that. No biggie. Apologize and move on.  \n\nIf she wants to be a homebody shut-in who cares. There is something about getting a little vitamin D now and again. Why not ask her - hey if there is ever anything you want to go do- I will gladly 100% go along with you.", "YTA. Isolating yourself that much isnt what \"normal\" people do, but normal is dumb. Let her be, as long as she's happy.", "YTA.", "NAH. You are understandably concerned, but maybe could gone about things differently.  Is she happy? Or, is she now sad, anxious, and unable to participate in activities she used to enjoy? If she's happy, you need to let it go.... different strokes for different folks.  If she's really unhappy, then talk to family and figure out a more supportive way to approach her.", "Parents that enable their adult children when there are obvious serious issues are a real problem. A kinder approach would be better but your sister is ill and needs help. NTA but you may have to accept this situation.", "YTA... \n\nShe seems content with her life. Let her have the peace and dignity of living it the way she wants.", "Info:\n\nIs your sister somewhere on the spectrum or potentially have some sort of sensory processing disorder? \n\nOr are you concerned this is more of a mental health issue? \n\nImpossible to judge otherwise", "YTA if she is struggling mentally you shouldn\u2019t have snapped at her. She\u2019s likely going to isolate even more now because of what you said to her", "Dunno about giving a vote on this one, but I'm really worried about OP's sister's vitamin D levels. She's unlikely to be getting anywhere to enough sun. I was kept indoors for a very long period by my abusive ex back before I fled that relationship, and when I was tested my doctor said I had the lowest vitamin D levels she'd ever seen (I had 8...'normal' should be above 30). I still haven't recovered fully.\n\n\nOP: your sister's pallor isn't the issue. If anything, might be healthy (avoids skin cancer). However, she should have her vitamin D levels checked, especially if she's experiencing symptoms such as hair loss, fatigue, struggle sleeping, muscle weakness, bone pain.\n\n\nMight have ruined a shot to express this concern, given the interactions already had, but maybe someone else could bring it up more gently? She wouldn't need to go out, necessarily, to fix a deficiency. It is a difficult vitamin to get from diet, though.", "NTA, you're trying to help but obviously some people don't want help or can't see they need it. Hopefully she figures it out before it gets worse.", "Why isn't it normal to not want to be around people... enjoying you're own company isn't abnormal... its just how some people choose to live. Stop trying to make her act how you perceive \"normal\" is. Let her live her own life and support her like family is meant to!", "NTA for the intent behind it but YTA for the execution", "YTA.", "YTA- I\u2019m jealous of your sister\u2026", "NTA. Maybe you could have avoided getting heated but frankly the way she is living her life is not normal, its not healthy, and you are right to suggest she find some counseling. Especially considering the comments you made about her losing touch with her friends. Unfortunately, she has to want to change her life for that to ever happen. Don't take my advice for the gospel but I think the best you can do is be there if she ever decides she isn't happy with her life.", "YTA\n\nI am agoraphobic and choose not to leave my house often. My husband doesn\u2019t pressure me and I am content. My therapist encourages me to leave when I\u2019m ready and, yes, we\u2019re working on the root cause of the issue. Your sister may or may not be agoraphobic, but she is human and should be treated with respect. Snapping at her and insulting her is not the way to go. The offer to go for a drive was a nice one, but perhaps should have been offered more as an activity for another day so that she could prepare for it.", "YTA honestly I\u2019d be living the same life if I wasn\u2019t married. Let her be, not everyone likes people.", "NTA\n\nI think you need to rephrase your perspective here. You are clearly concerned but it seems to have come off as a criticism. Try to talk to your mom about it as a concern of yours. It sounds like your sister might be agoraphobic, which is very different from just being an introvert who prefers her own company. Maybe read up on agoraphobia first.", "NAH. there's a lot of YTA people saying let her live her life.. like.. yeah ok ultimately yea.. But she needs to get to the bottom of this. There's something going on with her. That is not normal behavior and if there's an underlying cause not being addressed that's an issue. Let's not act like most of us wouldn't raise the same concerns about our own siblings if they did this", "NTA-staying at home that long is seriously bad for your mental health she needs a therapist or something, idk how her behaviour is so normalised in your family. You are just being a normal concerned brother.", "Privacy is one thing. This however doesn't feel normal. There are probably some mental health issues she's going through. She likely needs to speak to someone even if it's not what she wants to do.", "YTA. Fucking extroverts thinking their way is the only way to live. People like you are why I only leave my house when I'm being paid to leave. Apologize to your sister and maybe get some therapy to figure out why you're unable to be alone with yourself.", "YTA.   And you've just made certain you aren't welcome in her life.  Which doesn't sound like a great loss for her.", "YTA. Leave her alone. She is living mine and her dreams!", "Obviously you\u2019re an asshole, there is nothing wrong with how she chooses to live.

You\u2019re concerned about your sister and being that isolated certainly isn\u2019t normal or a good sign.

Let her live her life as she wants.", "YTA. You are telling her that her way of living isn't good. That is not up to you to decide. I do get it's probably coming from a good heart, but as long as she isn't doing anyone harm, leave her be.\n\n The risk of what you did is that she eventually doesn't want you in your life anymore", "NTA at all", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like your sister has agoraphobia.", "This is reddit, the headquarters of people who never leave their houses, so you'll probably get a lot of hate in these responses. I think this is an NAH situation. You're right to say that your sister's lifestyle is unhealthy, but I don't think she's an AH. It sounds like she's struggling with some serious phobias and anxieties, and right now they're winning. She needs help. You may just have to accept that you're not the one to provide it.", "My guess is she has a mental illness. Why - living in a mess, refusing to see people and refusing to leave. You can try and be more kind, but you can't fix her. If she is like my SIL everything you do will be wrong no matter how hard you try. They don't necessarily want to be that way, but she probably isn't going to change. You will just have to accept her until she decides to get help. NTA it is a shitty situation.", "NTA. She needs to seek professional help. That is not normal behavior. She has Agoraphobia", "NTA bit people here think you are because in true American fashion you are supposed to sugar-coat it", "NTA. You reacted to her snapping at you and that doesn't make you an AH. Your sister sounds like she might have that fear of leaving her house? I don't know the name, but sge definitely should be seeing a therapist. Being thst isolated isn't healthy", "ESH.  Look up \u201chikkomori\u201d.  But:\n\nSHE sucks because honestly, she does probably need professional help.  I\u2019m no psychologist, but I\u2019d think there\u2019s some mental/emotional/behavioral issues that need to be dealt with.  Not from a \u201cshe\u2019s weird\u201d standpoint but from a \u201cshe may be putting herself in a very bad position for the remainder of her life\u201d standpoint.\n\nYOU suck because you handled it like shit.  Aggressive, accusatory, not productive at all.\n\nYou, she, and your mom (enabler) should all seek professional counseling.", "NAH. She shouldn\u2019t have blown up on you, you shouldn\u2019t have returned in kind. Ultimately she sounds like she is living an unhealthy lifestyle (sunlight and human interaction are pretty important to health) but also she\u2019s an adult and you can\u2019t force her to change. Like most people living unhealthy lifestyles I\u2019m sure she\u2019s aware of it and if she doesn\u2019t want to change, you should drop it and decide what you want to do with that information.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You do need to tolerate it if you want to be part of her life, and that is entirely up to you to work on in your own psyche.

Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder that can cause people to be genuinely afraid to leave their house (among other symptoms).\n\nI leave my house about the same amount as your sister, maybe less, starting in August 2019. \n\nSomething I've learned in my time of isolation is that for certain people, like my self, the longer you're alone the less socialization you desire to have. Eventually socializing just feels like a burden and an annoyance. It also makes social situations anxiety inducing, since you are no longer used to being in those situations (which just adds onto the belief that socialization is anything but rewarding). After awhile of being alone it can make people feel like annoyances, even if you previously enjoyed spending time with them. \n\nAfter awhile you genuinely enjoy being alone. Once you start enjoying it you start to question why you would *need* to be around other people.\n\nIf you can get the same amount of serotonin by spending time just hanging around your home as you can get from doing something that takes more effort with equal pay off but more risks (such as embarrassing moments, accidents, annoying people, upsetting conversations, inconveniences, lack of control, ect), why would you purposely choose the more difficult task? (This isn't a genuine question, I understand this is a problematic view point, I'm just using it as an example of the thought process)\n\nIf I didn't live with my mom and brother I'd probably only ever talk to people 1-2 times a week at most and that's not even considering in person conversations (which would probably happen even less). One of the reasons I don't want to move out is because I'm scared that I'll lose my relationship with my mom because of this.\n\nIt similar to why people started to prefer things like \"TikTok\", \"YouTube shorts\" and whatever Instagrams version of it is, over longer videos. Both can be enjoyable but once you train your brain to get it's enjoyment the \"quick and easy\" way, it's difficult to convince it that the longer way is entertaining too. You get the same pleasure chemicals in your brain from one YouTube short as you do from one 10 minute YouTube video, so why go through the effort of watching the one video when you can watch ten videos in the same time span? \n\nIt's the same with leaving the house. I trained my brain to go for the \"safe, quick and easy\" way of obtaining pleasure chemicals within my house alone, making it so the pleasure chemicals I receive when I do leave the house and socialize it no longer feels as satisfying. It sounds like this is what happened with your sister as well.\n\nShe's used to staying home alone and it trained her brain to believe she no longer requires other forms of enjoyment other than what she is now used to (at least that's what it seems like from what you said).\n\nI'm going to say NTA because I've had people say the same things to me, though you should probably know that saying things like that will most likely be ineffective and will be viewed as harsh by the recipient. When people say things like that to me it generally only succeeds in annoying me, even if I understand that it's coming from a place of caring. \n\nYour mother is wrong for influencing your sister to believe this is normal, because (from the information you gave us) it's not.\n\nThe worst thing about all of this is that you will most likely not be able to help your sister, not until she's willing to help herself (or at least realizes she needs help). Any attempts you make will most likely be ineffective until she decides to work on it herself.\n\nWith something like this, it's really the person who's experiencing it that needs to do the work. No amount of people telling them there is something wrong, pestering, offers to help or comments about their lifestyle will change anything in any positive way until they decide to make a change themselves.\n\nI may be on the other side of this but I can see how my situation effects the people around me. They can't do anything to help and they've reached a place where they realized this, which is something I can see bothers them. Take care of yourself.\n\nIt's good that you attempted to bring it to your sisters attention that there is a problem, though (as I said), there's most likely not much you can do other than be a safe person for her to talk to and continuing to give her opportunities to leave. If it becomes too much for you to emotionally handle then take care of yourself and try again when you're in a good headspace to do so. \n\nI wish you luck \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, imagine one of your relative secluding itself for months.

I totally get your sister. I have spent the majority of my life disliking being around people, I don't hate them, but it felt like such a hassle to me to deal with other people and extremely draining, but when I was young my parents who are both very social people didn't understand that and would force me to go to gatherings full of strangers I didn't know or spend time with children my age that I didn't like because they thought it'd help me be social. I had severe anxiety as a child and had multiple anxiety attacks and that developed into depression as a teen. As soon as I was old enough to live on my own, i decided to live how i wanted to, to only socialized with whom i wanted and when i wanted. I'm now 40 years old, I live alone with my cat and visit my family once a year (they live on the other side of the state) and rarely interact with other people  and i'm in the best mental health of my life, my doctor likes to joke that i'm the most upbeat person she knows, i don't have anxiety attacks anymore, my house is clean, i look forward to waking up each day and doing whatever it is i want to do. Some people just aren't made for an outgoing social life. Some of us prefer to live quietly by ourselves and it is perfectly valid for people to feel that way. If your sister wants help, she'll ask for it, if you're concerned, be more understanding, apologize for overstepping and just tell her you've been worried because you love her but you totally get that she prefers her own company and if she changes her mind at any time, you'd love to spend more time with her. Leave it in her court, if she decides she wants to do something with you, she'll open that door.
