He doesn\u2019t know how allergies work, and honestly neither do I, but my understanding is you don\u2019t build up an immunity, but that more exposure can actually make it worse. He\u2019s being an AH for dismissing your very valid concerns. It\u2019s messed up that he\u2019s basically giving you medical advice when he doesn\u2019t have a clue. Who does he think he is??", "NTA. You\u2019ve been dating this man for 6 years and presumably want a future together. For him to get a dog that you can\u2019t be around at all, that will make his home untenable for you to even hang out in (assuming you don\u2019t live together) is ridiculous. Further exposure to an allergen in an uncontrolled way often makes the allergy worse, not better. You\u2019ve tried medicine and it hasn\u2019t been effective for you. He should be able to compromise and get a different breed, especially given that there are breeds you know that your body tolerates. It\u2019s insane to me how inconsiderate he\u2019s being.", "NTA. You have an allergy, but he\u2019s not taking it seriously. That\u2019s what makes him TA. I\u2019ve had labs, and I love labs, but if my so was allergic, to get one anyways would be an ah move. He could maybe get a labradoodle? All the fun of a lab with the hair of a poodle!", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is. You cannot magic away an allergy with time and good wishes. You're allergic and living with a lab would make you miserable in your own home, and no good partner would want that for you.", "NTA. My story is a little different im severely allergic to pine. Like Christmas trees. I cant even handle anything pine scented being around it can cause me to start getting sick and in an extreme case my throat to close. I take a daily allergy medication and I also have asthma.  \n\nI dated someone for a very short period of time. It was around Christmas and he wanted a real tree. I told him if he did I couldn't come over. He said I was being  dramatic but he would get a fake tree. Long story short he lied. I went over went into his apartment and knew he lied. I heard him lock the door behind me. He said he no one was allergic to Christmas trees and some other bullshit I don't remember much. My eyes started watering and my throat felt scratchy and I starting having trouble breathing.  He yelled at me to stop faking it till I passed out. I woke up intubated in the hospital. It was the worst reaction I'd ever had. They said he told the rescue I said inwas allergic to Christmas trees and inwas faking.  I almost died. I guess when they put the tube down my throat he realized I wasn't faking. \n\nDon't ever take chances with your allergies or with anyone willing to down play them. Why should you have to suffer or put your health in jeopardy.  I think you need to move on or seriously reconsider this relationship.  I ended up marrying a man who is allergic to pine and gets it.", "NTA. Successful relationships require compromises and honoring those compromises. If he won\u2019t compromise with you and respect your health than this is a sign of things to come", "NTA. This would be a deal breaker for  me as well. Every-time you go over to his home you would be uncomfortable. If you live together in the future you would be uncomfortable in your own home - that is no way to live. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you are against him getting  a hypoallergenic dog, which is what I\u2019d do if I was your boyfriend!", "Well, you know where you stand with him.  If he really wants a dog and also cares about your comfort and health he would get a poodle.\n\nYou are NTA.  He obviously doesn't care if you suffer as long as he gets his way.", "NTA\n\nKind of a bummer that he's ok with making you choose over a dog he doesn't even have.", "NTA. \n\nThere is no compromise. Either he gets the dog he wants and you leave him (for VERY GOOD REASON) or he can get a poodle and have a non-sneezy girlfriend. \n\nYour health and physical comfort come before his taste in dog breeds. If that means you have to break up with him, so be it. That's on him. \n\nAnd, let's just assume he's correct, that you could eventually get over your allergy via exposure therapy... it should still be your choice to do so. You have repeatedly said \"I'm allergic to every dog except poodles\" and he's willfully ignoring this very simple boundary.\n\nLet him call your bluff.", "NTA..Yes, he can technically get a dog if he wants to, but he shouldn't discount the seriousness of your allergies or insist you'll be fine in order to avoid your ultimatum.", "NTA - allergies, especially bad ones, are not fun to deal with.  Forcing that on you would be inconsiderate.  \n\nI have horrible cat allergies, and have to prep with medicine anytime I am going to be around them or it is torture.", "Interesting fact - There's actually no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog. https://www.healthline.com/health-news/no-hypoallergenic-dogs", "No if you are allergic then you are allergic, there shouldn't be a problem at all", "NTA for giving him fair warning. If he chooses a dog, he will be choosing a dog over you, and you'll be leaving. No reason to argue with him, just let him factually know that if he gets a dog that you're allergic to, you'll be out the door, end of story.", "NTA - If he wants a Labrador retriever more than a girlfriend, that's on him. Your concerns are valid. I am extremely allergic to cats, and it would be impossible to live with one even though I love cats.\n\nI think getting a standard poodle is a fair compromise - they are sweet, intelligent and sporty. Honestly a lot like a lab but with curls.", "\"I will get over my allergies the more I\u2019m around the dog \"\n\nYeah, no.  That's not how that works.\n\nNTA  You've tried pills, drops, and sprays.  You've tried.  It's a deal breaker.  That dog is a 12+ year commitment from him.", "NAH - he can get a dog if he wants, and you can dump him.", "NTA he should be prioritize your health over that of a potential pet. Most allergies dont just go away. Relationships are all about compromise. Seems like a red flag if he's unwilling especially since he could since he can still have a dog just a different breed.", "NTA\n\nIf he gets the dog, you need to leave him for your own health.\n\nIf he doesn't get the dog, he's going to resent you forever.\n\nThe fact that he's trying to convince you that you should have to be permanently medicated just to live in the house with him doesn't say a lot for how much he actually cares about you.", "NTA\n\nAsk him where he got his medical degree to be telling you that the longer you're around an allergen, the less it will bother you? He clearly cares more about a dog he doesn't even own that he does about you.", "NTA\n\nAnd if he chooses to get a lab over your legitimate health concerns, you know it\u2019s time for you to move on.", "NTA, your boyfriend does not understand how allergies work. The more you are exposed to the allergen the more intense your reaction will become. This is definitely a hill to die on here, if he gets a dog breed knowing you are allergic it is not only dismissing your physical condition its disrespectful and demeaning.", "NTA in any way shape or form. It is not like he has a dog and you just started dating him and you gave him a one-of-us-has-to go ultimatum.", "NTA. He's free to get the dog, but he knows your allergic to it. He's free to do as he wants, but actions have consequences and I don't think you're irrational for not wanting to be around the dog constantely\u2014which will most likely happen if you keep dating him.\n\nDo I think this could be a long conversation? Yes, absolutely. But I don't think you're wrong for your stance.", "NTA. Clearly he\u2019s chosen getting a lab over keeping you. This shows you exactly how much he considers your feelings and health into his decisions that affect you.\n\nLet him get his dog and break up with him. He\u2019ll be happier with his \u201cdream dog\u201d and without you. Otherwise, if he did not get his dog; you would always be to blame in his eyes.", "NTA. and you should get rid of the boyfriend, he sounds like a dick.", "NTA out I'm pretty sure you're about to be single.", "nta ask him about a labradoodle instead as compromise", "NAH. This is something he really wants, and something you really dont. You will have to each decide whether you can compromise/accept the other, or if you\u2019re just incompatible. \n\nFWIW, chances are good you will adapt to the dog and have much less of an allergic reaction, and eventually perhaps none at all. Of course, if it doesn\u2019t go that way, you\u2019ll have to decide what you want to do at that time.", "I have  allergies to pet dander too. I take an over the counter allergy pill every day. that works for me. \n\nthat being said NAH. he is free to get his preferred breed of dog. and you are free to end the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you've always lived with dogs, you want to always live with dogs.  To a lesser degree, I understand breed people, as I've lived with labs quite a lot of my life.  \n\nI got a different type of dog with my wife because she wanted something smaller.  You know what?  He's a great dog.  He doesn't do the things a lab does because he's not that type of breed (and there are plenty of small dogs that will) but I love him as much as any other dog I've got. \n\nIt would be smart for him to get a hypoallergenic dog if he wants to date someone with severe dog allergies.\n\n\nQuestion though, do you take prescription pills for it?  There's stuff doctors can provide that are more effective for pet allergies than OTC medicine.", "NTA, and stand firm on this, your health matters.

I discovered this when my dad remarried and my stepmum had a boxer. Lovely dog, I miss her like max but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that for probably six months or more I couldn\u2019t breathe at home.

And suddenly youll be fine.", "With pet allergies, exposure does decrease the response to that specific animal for most people. So in this case not all Labs, but their specific Lab. \n\nOP as others have said, my opinion is NAH. A poodle and a lab are not interchangeable in that they can have very different temperaments. That said, if your BF has never been around a full size poodle he doesn\u2019t know if he likes them or not. This is a situation where a lot of compromise maybe needed. He needs to be willing to look at and get to know poodles to see if he can have a poodle instead.
