He doesn\u2019t know how allergies work, and honestly neither do I, but my understanding is you don\u2019t build up an immunity, but that more exposure can actually make it worse. He\u2019s being an AH for dismissing your very valid concerns. It\u2019s messed up that he\u2019s basically giving you medical advice when he doesn\u2019t have a clue. Who does he think he is??", "NTA. You\u2019ve been dating this man for 6 years and presumably want a future together. For him to get a dog that you can\u2019t be around at all, that will make his home untenable for you to even hang out in (assuming you don\u2019t live together) is ridiculous. Further exposure to an allergen in an uncontrolled way often makes the allergy worse, not better. You\u2019ve tried medicine and it hasn\u2019t been effective for you. He should be able to compromise and get a different breed, especially given that there are breeds you know that your body tolerates. It\u2019s insane to me how inconsiderate he\u2019s being.", "NTA. You have an allergy, but he\u2019s not taking it seriously. That\u2019s what makes him TA. I\u2019ve had labs, and I love labs, but if my so was allergic, to get one anyways would be an ah move. He could maybe get a labradoodle? All the fun of a lab with the hair of a poodle!", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is. You cannot magic away an allergy with time and good wishes. You're allergic and living with a lab would make you miserable in your own home, and no good partner would want that for you.", "NTA. My story is a little different im severely allergic to pine. Like Christmas trees. I cant even handle anything pine scented being around it can cause me to start getting sick and in an extreme case my throat to close. I take a daily allergy medication and I also have asthma.  \n\nI dated someone for a very short period of time. It was around Christmas and he wanted a real tree. I told him if he did I couldn't come over. He said I was being  dramatic but he would get a fake tree. Long story short he lied. I went over went into his apartment and knew he lied. I heard him lock the door behind me. He said he no one was allergic to Christmas trees and some other bullshit I don't remember much. My eyes started watering and my throat felt scratchy and I starting having trouble breathing.  He yelled at me to stop faking it till I passed out. I woke up intubated in the hospital. It was the worst reaction I'd ever had. They said he told the rescue I said inwas allergic to Christmas trees and inwas faking.  I almost died. I guess when they put the tube down my throat he realized I wasn't faking. \n\nDon't ever take chances with your allergies or with anyone willing to down play them. Why should you have to suffer or put your health in jeopardy.  I think you need to move on or seriously reconsider this relationship.  I ended up marrying a man who is allergic to pine and gets it.", "NTA. Successful relationships require compromises and honoring those compromises. If he won\u2019t compromise with you and respect your health than this is a sign of things to come", "NTA. This would be a deal breaker for  me as well.

If he really wants a dog and also cares about your comfort and health he would get a poodle.\n\nYou are NTA.  He obviously doesn't care if you suffer as long as he gets his way.", "NTA\n\nKind of a bummer that he's ok with making you choose over a dog he doesn't even have.", "NTA. \n\nThere is no compromise. Either he gets the dog he wants and you leave him (for VERY GOOD REASON) or he can get a poodle and have a non-sneezy girlfriend. \n\nYour health and physical comfort come before his taste in dog breeds. If that means you have to break up with him, so be it. That's on him. \n\nAnd, let's just assume he's correct, that you could eventually get over your allergy via exposure therapy... it should still be your choice to do so.

Forcing that on you would be inconsiderate.  \n\nI have horrible cat allergies, and have to prep with medicine anytime I am going to be around them or it is torture.", "Interesting fact - There's actually no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog. https://www.healthline.com/health-news/no-hypoallergenic-dogs", "No if you are allergic then you are allergic, there shouldn't be a problem at all", "NTA for giving him fair warning. If he chooses a dog, he will be choosing a dog over you, and you'll be leaving. No reason to argue with him, just let him factually know that if he gets a dog that you're allergic to, you'll be out the door, end of story.", "NTA - If he wants a Labrador retriever more than a girlfriend, that's on him. Your concerns are valid. I am extremely allergic to cats, and it would be impossible to live with one even though I love cats.\n\nI think getting a standard poodle is a fair compromise - they are sweet, intelligent and sporty. Honestly a lot like a lab but with curls.", "\"I will get over my allergies the more I\u2019m around the dog \"\n\nYeah, no.  That's not how that works.\n\nNTA  You've tried pills, drops, and sprays.  You've tried.  It's a deal breaker.  That dog is a 12+ year commitment from him.", "NAH - he can get a dog if he wants, and you can dump him.", "NTA he should be prioritize your health over that of a potential pet. Most allergies dont just go away. Relationships are all about compromise. Seems like a red flag if he's unwilling especially since he could since he can still have a dog just a different breed.", "NTA\n\nIf he gets the dog, you need to leave him for your own health.\n\nIf he doesn't get the dog, he's going to resent you forever.\n\nThe fact that he's trying to convince you that you should have to be permanently medicated just to live in the house with him doesn't say a lot for how much he actually cares about you.", "NTA\n\nAsk him where he got his medical degree to be telling you that the longer you're around an allergen, the less it will bother you? He clearly cares more about a dog he doesn't even own that he does about you.", "NTA\n\nAnd if he chooses to get a lab over your legitimate health concerns, you know it\u2019s time for you to move on.", "NTA, your boyfriend does not understand how allergies work. The more you are exposed to the allergen the more intense your reaction will become. This is definitely a hill to die on here, if he gets a dog breed knowing you are allergic it is not only dismissing your physical condition its disrespectful and demeaning.", "NTA in any way shape or form. It is not like he has a dog and you just started dating him and you gave him a one-of-us-has-to go ultimatum.", "NTA. He's free to get the dog, but he knows your allergic to it. He's free to do as he wants, but actions have consequences and I don't think you're irrational for not wanting to be around the dog constantely\u2014which will most likely happen if you keep dating him.\n\nDo I think this could be a long conversation? Yes, absolutely. But I don't think you're wrong for your stance.", "NTA. Clearly he\u2019s chosen getting a lab over keeping you. This shows you exactly how much he considers your feelings and health into his decisions that affect you.\n\nLet him get his dog and break up with him. He\u2019ll be happier with his \u201cdream dog\u201d and without you. Otherwise, if he did not get his dog; you would always be to blame in his eyes.", "NTA. and you should get rid of the boyfriend, he sounds like a dick.", "NTA out I'm pretty sure you're about to be single.", "nta ask him about a labradoodle instead as compromise", "NAH. This is something he really wants, and something you really dont. You will have to each decide whether you can compromise/accept the other, or if you\u2019re just incompatible. \n\nFWIW, chances are good you will adapt to the dog and have much less of an allergic reaction, and eventually perhaps none at all. Of course, if it doesn\u2019t go that way, you\u2019ll have to decide what you want to do at that time.", "I have  allergies to pet dander too.

That said, if your BF has never been around a full size poodle he doesn\u2019t know if he likes them or not. This is a situation where a lot of compromise maybe needed.

I'm going with NTA, because he's known about your allergies all along, and it doesn't seem to be getting through to him that not all allergies simply go away, even with medicine and allergy shots. If he proceeds with getting this dog, you will know where you fall in priority in his life, and it will hurt for some time, but you will be stronger by ending it if he does, and I hope you end up with an amazing life!", "NAH. This is one of those situations, imo, where it\u2019s an incompatibility issue overall. I understand his desire to get a specific dog as someone who doesn\u2019t want kids and sees their dog as their kid/family. He\u2019s of course venturing into AH territory by dismissing you, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re not married or living together from what I read.

I take double allergy pills, and still sneeze and look like I'm crying.  For me, it's a way of life, and my choice, and one I've clearly never outgrown, despite 60+ years of exposure. OP, your BF is TAH if he doesn't understand just how miserable you would be around a lab.  They are wonderful dogs, but it's not his call.  You are the one who would suffer.  He can either get a hypoallergenic dog, or none, or you walk.  It's completely your call. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You have an allergy to dogs that shed, labs are beautiful but shed like crazy. One of my best friends has a lab and even though she is the cleanest person I know and touches up constantly, you can\u2019t sit on furniture without wearing fur. \n\nHe\u2019s about to make his home inhospitable for you for the next 10+ years and he\u2019s wondering why it would make you question the relationship?

You have been more than upfront with your health.\n\nFrom a fellow allergy sufferer: Look into allergy shots from your doctor.\n\nThese are helpful long term. They're not masking the allergy symptoms. They're actually desensitizing you to your allergens. \n\nChanged my life when I got allergy testing and treatment. I finally don't get knocked on my ass by my allergies multiple times per year.", "NTA.  This guy doesn't care about you, nor does his family.  I'm not even sure why you'd doubt yourself on this one.

It's a bigger dog but still a poodle. They're also very smart (probably smarter than your partner).", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t have it yet, so at this point he has to make a choice. The dog or you. There are plenty of types of dogs that are hypoallergenic, you just need to do a little research and meet the dog to ensure it doesn\u2019t cause a reaction before getting it and if he wants to build a life with you, he needs to take you into consideration as well. Also, and I cannot stress this enough, not all poodle mixes are hypoallergenic. My friend has a dog allergy and purebred poodles and other hypoallergenic dogs are fine but my poodle mix still gives her a minor reaction.", "NTA\n\nIf you have allergies, then that will affect your life from the get go.  There is no pill or shot that can make this go away.  And while yes you do grow out of allergies, it takes years to do such.

Dog was well trained from the get go and we worked with  him until the day he died.  Loveable and warm, friendly and ate up the attention.  Only 2 things that was a problem:  One, he inhaled food like was dirt going into a vacuum cleaner, and then 30 minutes later it would be on the floor, had to get him a slow feeder.  2)  When he was nearing the end of his life, his hips gave out.  Best dog ever, but will not get another one.  I want a poodle, they are intelligent and loving.", "It sounds like he already has made up his mind on how he wants to proceed with this relationship.

But seriously it sounds like you've suffered a lot and your bf hasn't taken your allergy seriously.", "NTA. Our first cat was a Persian mix with longish hair and my husband was fine. Could sleep with her. (And me). The kids were fine. \n\nThen we got a domestic short hair kitten. Turns out husband was allergic, daughter was allergic, and the PERSIAN CAT was allergic.

This may be a hot take for some, but i feel like having dogs is like having children for some people. For lots of people having/not having them is a dealbreaker.  If i was told that i couldn\u2019t have the dog, i just simply wouldn\u2019t be dating them. If you guys can get on the same page and get a poodle, i think that would be the best solution/compromise, otherwise, probably just not meant to be. Also whats the chance he continues to dream about having his own labrador? If its clear hes obsessed with this idea, the likelihood of this conversation coming up again in 10 years when he wants another dog is likely. you should go find someone who doesn\u2019t want pets and he should find someone who can deal with him having labradors or want them too.", "Hey I have allergies but my shitzu is hypoallergenic shitzus are also great first dogs, they may be on the small side but they\u2019re absolutely adorable (at least mine is) and as long as you keep up with their haircuts they don\u2019t Matte easily and they don\u2019t shed just a thought on another breed instead of a lab", "What happened with your ex after that?

Ridiculous.", "There is also technically exposure therapy for allergens, but it's in a controlled environment (aka the doctor's office), using an incredibly tiny amount of the allergen in a pill or injection, and it's not guaranteed to work. It also depends a lot on what exactly the allergy is.\n\nExposing yourself at home is basically always a bad idea. You have a chance of making a previously mild allergy develop into anaphylactic shock, and I don't need to explain why that's bad lol", "I keep telling this to people! I literally found out I was allergic to dogs when I was helping a family friend by taking care of their litter of golden doodle puppies while they were in the hospital!
