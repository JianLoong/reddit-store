People can spend a night away from their kids, and OPs choice to stay up until they got back is OP\u2019s choice. The issue for me is whether leaving a 7 year old kid for a sleepover is a problem with a single adult present", "He did get upset during the night. That was the responsibility of the dad. Even if he hadn't, he agreed to be the one to take care of his kid and he didn't. He wasn't there. It doesn't matter if the kid didor didn't have trouble. It was dad's responsibility and he dropped the ball. \n\nThat you can't understand that makes me wonder how irresponsible you are in real life."]}
