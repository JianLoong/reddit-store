I never knew marriages can be so casual as buying cabbages on the street. You're not the AH here but I guess from now on you never take any of their opinions on marriages seriously and don't bother with trying to talk your brother out of bad life choices. He likes to burn your parent's money and they are willing to let him burn it. If they have financial issues in the future let your brother deal with it as you've already done all you can to help them prevent this.", "NTA.

You have to go to the courthouse still and actually get married legally. Just like everyone else who has ever gotten married.
