We need perspectives!) I did point out to him that his post is a little skewed.\n\nI'm honestly not bitter (well maybe just a tad lol) but let's add some more information here:\n\n1. My role is also incredibly high pressured, leading a medium - large sized organisation (not small), while our household benefits from his salary, I have 40+ employees who depend on a job that I provide them. We also exist to improve health outcomes of our clients, an important service for the community. Economically, my role generates far greater financial and social return for the wider community.\n2. On a monthly basis my salary represents approx 35-40% of the NET income. My husband does get a great bonus once a year, but his post used gross salary figures. He pays a significant amount of tax whereas I don't being in the social services sector.\n3. Yes he took 7 months of parental leave, but our child went to daycare from 4 months onwards... his remaining 3 months parental leave gave him a chance to have a career break and reset (which I was encouraging of).\n4. I've never said I wasn't committing to taking parental leave, I said I need to decide what is best for my situation. His response was always 'show me a plan', putting the mental load of planning (and burden to make it work) on me.\n5. I've said that I recognise we would need to outsource help if he still has to work long hours and I'm managing my job, 2 kids, cooking and managing the household\n6. He also said he won't take more than 2 weeks of leave this time around... but here he said 6 weeks - that's awesome, because he deserves more time with his child, if you can take 6 weeks, why wouldn't you want to (and be a positive example in your workplace!).\n7. This post all started when he walked into the room a few hours ago and said he was ready to start thinking about baby #2, we equally want a second child but are trying to work out how best to go about it.\n\nWhat isn't necessarily mentioned here is how I accept (regretfully) that having a second child means the increased mental and physical load on myself. Some facts from our first child:\n\n1. Since the day our child was born, I have done 95% of the night shifts (and still worked a full-time job)\n2. I do 70% of the cooking (which sucks because he's a great cook but I do the weekday cooking for the family).\n3. I work full-time but have to leave work early to do the daycare pick up and make up the hours from 9pm - midnight, meaning I get less sleep than him and more interrupted sleep.\n\nSo are you an AH for asking me to sacrifice and take \"my turn\"?

It's unreasonable. \n\n>The Wife is likely more concerned about the charity she nurtures and runs floundering or collapsing than her husband, yes. That\u2019s probably why She doesn\u2019t want to take long leave. Or she just wants another kid but doesn\u2019t like being solely responsible for an infant for long periods, who knows.\n\n\"Likely\" and \"Probably\" are doing a lot of heavy lifting mate.\n\nAlso, none of those assumptions make her look better.\n\nImagine a man saying \"I want another kid, I just don't want to take care of it\", that's not a reasonable argument.", "I said absolutely nothing about the current situation, I was 100% replying to the ignoramus above me who made such a jackass remark I had to say something. \n\nFor the record, OP is right here and his wife is wrong, but they both need to look realistically at the situation if neither is willing to take time to be with the kids.", "It\u2019s a nonprofit. Without her it won\u2019t make it.", "Basically yeah. This is how it works. It could be a strain if you are highly qualified and they can't find proper replacement. However, they can't deny you a parental leave, it's simply their problem. Where I live 40% of the salary goes for taxes. Some percentage of those 40% goes for parental leave, so technically I pay for it now and when/if I have kids the goverment will pay me back by paying me salary instead of the company. \nIt's the same for healthcare. You pay it now and you get free treatment when/if you need it.", "I feel like he meant more along the lines of how companies manage when someone isn't in their position for that long. Like my hotel would crumble if I took that long off and I wouldn't have a job to go back to.", "Where I live the goverment pays you 80% of the salary for 12 months. And the company pays 100% of the salary for your replacement.\nEdit: 80% of YOURS salary", "Same with my family. And the grandparents were involved with some extra childcare help. And yeah, inflation with wage stagnation has definitely done a number on cost of living.", "Are you indentured?\nRefuse.  Tell your direct supervisor before you refuse that childcare is not part of your job and it is interfering with your work.\n\nShe\u2019s not your CEO who will fire you for Not doing something that is Not your job, right?\n\n\u201cHere Aoike, you watch my baby while I do things.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I need you to!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do my job if I carry my baby into the meeting!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you looked into hiring someone?  Interns are often looking for side jobs because we pay them terribly.\u201d", "Of course it\u2019s reasonable.  MANY people want a kid but don\u2018t want to care for an infant for long stretches, it\u2019s exhausting.  If their partner is willing to, yay.\n\nIf not - that\u2019s when the partner says \u201cHmm, no.  I don\u2019t want to do that.  Here\u2019s some options.  If none of those work for both of us then we won\u2019t have another kid.\u201d", "Ok,\n\nThen she gets a normal job.... If she wants another child she has to take time off to care for it equal to her partner. \n\n\nIf she had cancer it would continue or not. You don't live your life for a job especially one that doesn't pay the bills", "But, they are finding a replacement while you are gone. What happens to that replacement when you are ready to return to work?", "> Like my hotel would crumble if I took that long off and I wouldn't have a job to go back to.\n\nThis is an example of inherently bad management and business planning, not an issue with parental leave.\n\nBy this logic, if you get a severe injury, or a severe illness, your hotel will 'crumble.'  There's no redundancy built in.", "They know that this could happen, especially when hiring young women, so they probably have some strategies. They have few months to prepare because women usually tell they their managers about the pregnancy early enough. Some companies will hire replacement earlier (like a month or so) and ask the pregnant employee to teach them the basics. It's not the ideal solution for companies but yeah...", "I thought that too, until I got to the mention of a government subsidy, which made me think they were talking about paying for maternity leave.\n\nAnyway, even if you\u2019re right, I\u2019ve written it now anyway! \ud83d\ude02", "That sounds amazing!! Much better for new parents!! \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our deal in the UK: Statutory Maternity Pay ( SMP ) is paid for up to 39 weeks. You get: 90% of your average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first 6 weeks. \u00a3172.48 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks. You can take a full 12 months off and your workplace must allow you to return to the same position you left, but weeks 40-52 are unpaid.", "No, that's not reasonable. I'm sorry, it just isn't.\n\nIf you're unwilling to parent an infant for stretches by yourself, you aren't ready to be a parent.\n\nBeing a parent is a 24/7 job, if you can't accept that, kids aren't for you.", "The replacement employee knows that the position is temporary. They know exactly for how long they are staying. So, they either start looking for another job few months before the replacement ends OR they file for unemployement. Sometimes, in bigger companies, they don't hire new person but they rather give your job to the other employees with similar position.\nEdit: grammar", "Oh you're not wrong at all! We're a ship with no real captain. Just me and another front desk agent pretending to be management... \ud83e\udd37 \n\nWe get by, but real talk if me or her got taken out of the picture for any reason for too long, the other would jump ship and then, well some billionaires would die 100 years later trying to see it! \n\nBut until then we're enjoying splitting the extra pay while slowly going insane \ud83d\ude43 I ordered a new exhaust for my dad's Mustang, don't know when I'll get to drive it and hear it...\n\n3 edits to fix the typos, I'm not burnt out at all....", "Right, but then while she/he (some of these countries have it men and women) gets pregnant while on/right after paternity leave, going back on it almost immediately. Like we all know that couple that just kept popping kids out like they were rabbits. \n\nTbh y'all have been doing this so you've probably figured something out, but it sounds insane to someone who's never heard of it before. Like if my other manager or me did that, \ud83d\ude33 we would HAVE to train them ourselves before taking leave, and then, what? They just stay in that job until we're back? And then? But again you're country probably has better social safety nets so my temporary replacement wouldn't be fucked while they look for another job. \n\n\nAnd the back to back kids thing might be less common there? \n\n\nIt's just a foreign concept, needs more guns, freedom, and fryer oil for me to fully grasp it, does it come in a biggie size?", "It was a bit of both. Where does the money come from and how do companies manage to hold positions open for the return of a parent after a year.\n\nThe reliance on temporary workers to fill in the gaps makes sense. Thank you for explaining.", "Here you don't have the unpaid option. It's 12 months for everyone and that's it. But I think it's nice to have unoaid option too especially for parents that struggle to find childcare.", "Well the replacement person knows that that position is temporary. Actually they know exactly how long they are staying so I guess that most of them start looking for a job few months before they leave the replacement position. About the kids...well most of the people in Europe have 2 kids max. Those that have more are either very rich or very poor (this is different problem and I won't go into the details because I don't want to insult anyone). \nBut I feel the same about the US. I was just telling someone the other day that not having maternity leave would scare the shit out of me \ud83d\ude02\nEdit: spelling"]}
