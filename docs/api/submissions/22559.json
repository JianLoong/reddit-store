We need perspectives!) I did point out to him that his post is a little skewed.\n\nI'm honestly not bitter (well maybe just a tad lol) but let's add some more information here:\n\n1. My role is also incredibly high pressured, leading a medium - large sized organisation (not small), while our household benefits from his salary, I have 40+ employees who depend on a job that I provide them. We also exist to improve health outcomes of our clients, an important service for the community. Economically, my role generates far greater financial and social return for the wider community.\n2. On a monthly basis my salary represents approx 35-40% of the NET income. My husband does get a great bonus once a year, but his post used gross salary figures. He pays a significant amount of tax whereas I don't being in the social services sector.\n3. Yes he took 7 months of parental leave, but our child went to daycare from 4 months onwards... his remaining 3 months parental leave gave him a chance to have a career break and reset (which I was encouraging of).\n4. I've never said I wasn't committing to taking parental leave, I said I need to decide what is best for my situation. His response was always 'show me a plan', putting the mental load of planning (and burden to make it work) on me.\n5. I've said that I recognise we would need to outsource help if he still has to work long hours and I'm managing my job, 2 kids, cooking and managing the household\n6. He also said he won't take more than 2 weeks of leave this time around... but here he said 6 weeks - that's awesome, because he deserves more time with his child, if you can take 6 weeks, why wouldn't you want to (and be a positive example in your workplace!).\n7. This post all started when he walked into the room a few hours ago and said he was ready to start thinking about baby #2, we equally want a second child but are trying to work out how best to go about it.\n\nWhat isn't necessarily mentioned here is how I accept (regretfully) that having a second child means the increased mental and physical load on myself. Some facts from our first child:\n\n1. Since the day our child was born, I have done 95% of the night shifts (and still worked a full-time job)\n2. I do 70% of the cooking (which sucks because he's a great cook but I do the weekday cooking for the family).\n3. I work full-time but have to leave work early to do the daycare pick up and make up the hours from 9pm - midnight, meaning I get less sleep than him and more interrupted sleep.\n\nSo are you an AH for asking me to sacrifice and take \"my turn\"?

Again, he doesn\u2019t want to risk losing his job. It\u2019s like you minimize the important of his career while overinflating your own. \n\nRegarding the rest of your points, if he dropped the ball that hard with the first kid (not saying he didn\u2019t) - why the hell are you wanting a second kid and then having *him* stay home doing the things* you claim he dropped the ball on?? That makes no sense. \n\nY\u2019all prlly shouldn\u2019t have the second kid tbh.", "It was so great to read the other side for once!\n\nThis could be a whole new sub type to explore.

First baby was actually in daycare from four months on so half OPs long ass paternal leave was just 3 months of him recharging and looking for a new job.\n\nWonder if she was still doing all the night wakings then too since she apparently has been doing 95% of it since first baby was born (and doing all the daycare drop offs and pick ups).  In fact she gets to make up for lost time on picking up for daycare by staying up til midnight frequently while still doing night wakings, so she gets less sleep than he does and it\u2019s constantly interrupted sleep as well.", "Link to Wife\u2019s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152x16t/aita_for_asking_wife_to_take_her_turn_of_parental/jsgpo3v/", "She also said they equally decided they want a second kid.", "Jerry!

I'm a mom of 4 that has gotten at least 6-12 months off for each child with full benefits and my husband has gotten almost as much (at different times).  I live in Northern Europe. I wouldn't say I have a career, but I know hard work.  But I remember those first years of infancy for all my babies and imagining leaving them at 6 weeks old to be cared for by a stranger... it breaks my heart.  My kids have all gone to daycare but the earliest any of them went there was at 14 months.", "what you mean most people can't take more that 8 w with the baby at home? then why are you being a parent? and this go BOTH ways mom and dad lmao", "Doesn't sound like he actually *wants* a second child.\n\nAt the very least, it doesn't sound like he enjoyed caring for an infant at all the 1st time and his refusal to take any real parental leave this time might be his way of telling you that.", "That's exactly the point! Most people posting here don't want the truth, they want to be right and prove it :)", "I don\u2019t think shaming people for hiring nannies is the takeaway here. It takes a village. If you don\u2019t have a village, you hire one.

Scratchin' my head.", "Yeah, I was working off of the assumption that the OP and his replies were truthful. If that really is the wife and \\*she's\\* giving accurate information then I don't think these two people should be having a second kid right now because 1.) it doesn't sound like either of them have time for an infant right now and 2.) they both sound bitter about each other's workload as it is.", "I\u2019m also in uk and have an eight month old - the American system just sends me cold.

She said it's 40 people in the place. It wouldn't matter if she personally managed all 40 or only 4 people. \n\nThat shouldn't trump her family. The decision is, do I take 6 months off paid maternity leave OR do I go back after a few weeks? \n\nWhy would you want to? \n\nIn light of options, good ones, going back is intentionally giving up benefits and putting more strain on the household than there needs to be. OP took 7 months off for his parental leave. She went against her agreement and went back far earlier than arranged \"for the people\"....yeah, people she doesn't know! Ok, it has far reaching implications in the community.....it has implications at her own household too! \n\nThe business will manage, end of story. \n\nThe husband took 7 months off, changed career, the \"reboot\" to take different responsibilities and less progression/potential. That was a solid family first move. \n\nThe wife, agreed to several months, went back after several weeks, when she has other options. And she didn't do it for her family, she did it for co-workers in a business which is public sector and will 100% without shadow of a doubt continue in her absence and the *thought* of helping others. Which sounds selfless. That's nice. But it came at the expense of the household. \n\nAs for the health sector overall, it's irrelevant to the post. It is what it is, but it's not 1 persons sole responsibility. \n\nAs for comparison of their roles, it's all in the post and comments to read.", "Absolutely.  There are potential compromises if she thinks she can't take that long.  Plenty of babies start child care earlier in life because their parents have to work.
