We need perspectives!) I did point out to him that his post is a little skewed.\n\nI'm honestly not bitter (well maybe just a tad lol) but let's add some more information here:\n\n1. My role is also incredibly high pressured, leading a medium - large sized organisation (not small), while our household benefits from his salary, I have 40+ employees who depend on a job that I provide them. We also exist to improve health outcomes of our clients, an important service for the community. Economically, my role generates far greater financial and social return for the wider community.\n2. On a monthly basis my salary represents approx 35-40% of the NET income. My husband does get a great bonus once a year, but his post used gross salary figures. He pays a significant amount of tax whereas I don't being in the social services sector.\n3. Yes he took 7 months of parental leave, but our child went to daycare from 4 months onwards... his remaining 3 months parental leave gave him a chance to have a career break and reset (which I was encouraging of).\n4. I've never said I wasn't committing to taking parental leave, I said I need to decide what is best for my situation. His response was always 'show me a plan', putting the mental load of planning (and burden to make it work) on me.\n5. I've said that I recognise we would need to outsource help if he still has to work long hours and I'm managing my job, 2 kids, cooking and managing the household\n6. He also said he won't take more than 2 weeks of leave this time around... but here he said 6 weeks - that's awesome, because he deserves more time with his child, if you can take 6 weeks, why wouldn't you want to (and be a positive example in your workplace!).\n7. This post all started when he walked into the room a few hours ago and said he was ready to start thinking about baby #2, we equally want a second child but are trying to work out how best to go about it.\n\nWhat isn't necessarily mentioned here is how I accept (regretfully) that having a second child means the increased mental and physical load on myself. Some facts from our first child:\n\n1. Since the day our child was born, I have done 95% of the night shifts (and still worked a full-time job)\n2. I do 70% of the cooking (which sucks because he's a great cook but I do the weekday cooking for the family).\n3. I work full-time but have to leave work early to do the daycare pick up and make up the hours from 9pm - midnight, meaning I get less sleep than him and more interrupted sleep.\n\nSo are you an AH for asking me to sacrifice and take \"my turn\"?

If the leave is longer, will either of your incomes or employment status be affected? The conversation should also consider desire. Many mothers I know have struggled with the isolation, exhaustion and lack of adult/intellectual stimulation that comes with leave. These struggles can lead to identity questioning.
