There's nothing wrong with her wanting to work, of course, but if she has the ability to take 3-6 months of paid leave, and taking more than a few weeks would threaten your job stability, then just waiting to see how she feels about taking the leave until after your child is born is not a viable option.", "NAH - you need to have a conversation about this with your wife.", "INFO: Why does one of you need to take parental leave for 3-6 months?

Also, who would run the charity in your wife's place for that long?", "You need to have a concrete plan for how you'll handle childcare, but YTA if your plan is for her to take an amount of leave that would irrevocably damage your wife's business. \n\n A third option exists where you pay a caregiver - is that on the table?", "I mean this isn't really an AH situation, you pretty much said it yourself, if you don't have room in your lives - for whatever reason - for .second child, then dont have one. \n\nThat said, it is kinda strange to me that you NEED her to commit to months off? Why is that? You would need to figure out a different structure to having a newborn but 6 weeks isn't that short, many people do this both by choice and obligation (no im not american before anyone says that), what is it you're worried about if you both go back to work?

Most people like to have a set plan for bringing a new child into this world and not just wing it and see what happens. If the wife is able to take an extended period of time to spend and bond with her child, and doesn\u2019t, then childcare is required. And Idk if you\u2019ve seen how much childcare costs these days, but it\u2019s borderline ridiculous what daycares are charging (and infants are typically up-charged because they require much more attention).
