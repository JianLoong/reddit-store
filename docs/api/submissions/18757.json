Mike and the other child got along, and would be trying to bowl together at times.  But whenever Mike wasn't there, then Tracy would be up there with her, or talking to her friend.

HER choice.\n\nSome nerve to complain when the kids respond in an honest manner. Kids WANT  a loving mom. It's probably a constant source of pain that she doesn't care. Can they be blamed for minimizing contact? Who would put up with this if they had a choice?", "NTA. I mean are you really surprised by her behavior though? She lost custody and only has 3-4 visits during an entire year? She also hasn\u2019t regained custody during the whole time you met, dated, and married. Tbh I don\u2019t know how you can love someone who cares so little about her own children", "NTA\n\nIf it fits.\nCan't blame the kids for wanting to spend the time with humans who care abaut them.\nDid she even shrug when she got the info?\n\n\nP.S. english is my second langueage", "I don't think you would be an AH for telling this woman that she has literally abandoned her kids. But I wonder why in the world you're with her, when you're clearly an empathetic person - and she absolutely is not. Her behavior is terrible. She is an AH and should be told that, followed by a divorce.", "NTA Your wife is the asshole here. She clearly doesn't care that much about her kids. Inviting her kids to her birthday sounds nice in theory, but the host of a party rarely gets to spend quality time with anyone who comes. Since she can only see her kids 3 or 4 times a year, each visit is important and should just be both of you and the kids so they get her full attention.   \nI can't imagine a scenario where you bringing this up doesn't end in a fight, so it depends on how much you think she needs to hear it. She wants a good relationship with her kids without having to put in any effort. Her children do not owe her a relationship, and since she's not done much to foster one, they're totally valid in stopping contact. A lot of parents feel that they're entitled to a relationship with their children and that's just not true. \n\nSo I don't think you'd be an asshole for bringing this up, but your wife certainly will. She may eventually take it to heart, but that depends on the kind of person she is.", "NTA\n but please do not have children with this woman. it must be a serious issue if the court only gave 3 times visitation/year to a mother esp when the children are underage", "NTA.

Also, are you sure you want to be with someone who is like that towards her own children?", "Look at you OP judging a woman who has lost custody of her children and continues to do a piss poor job over the little visitation she gets.   You married said woman. What does that say about you?   NTA by the way.", "NTA, but you realize that the person you\u2019re with reflects on you, right? Is this really the type of person you want to share your life with?", "NTA \n\nI wouldn't want to stay married to someone who is so selfish that not only did they lose custody of their kids, spends the little time they do have ignoring said children.", "NTA but don't you think she already knows it's her fault?", "YWBTA if you volunteer that information. I don't think you'll have to wait long before she presents an opportunity for obliviously complaining about it. Also, what the hell do you see in a psycho like that? She reflects very badly on you.", "You'd be absolutely right, but I suppose you'd also be an asshole. It won't help at this stage, so it'd just be pointlessly saying something that'd hurt her feelings. I mean... Would it change anything?", "It\u2019s a shame she doesn\u2019t realize it herself. But you are completely justified in helping her read the room. \n\nNTA.", "YWBTA if you said this. I hope you\u2019ll consider what you would hope to achieve by telling her this? I\u2019m also curious why you think it would have a positive impact? People don\u2019t change unless they want to and are willing to put in the work and make sacrifices, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case. The best thing you could do is suggest your wife talk to a therapist if she wants to improve her relationship with her kids.", "YWBTA, unfortunately.\n\nYour wife's priorities aren't great, but it's clear her kids aren't it. If she goes on and on (and on) without self reflection, then no, you'd be on safe ground to say it. But an unprompted examination of her poor parenting would be you getting a load off your chest, not actively helping her in any way. If that's what you want for yourself, then go for it, but be prepared for a fight.", "YWBTA. Your input is unprompted and unnecessary. You married her so you have to support her grief through this time. The only acceptable place to mention this would be in a therapy session.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's very simple to me: She ignored her children, so now they don't want a relationship with her.
