He left but today I was called into the office, the principal said I would be receiving an in school suspension for this week due to \"making your peers and staff uncomfortable with your physical appearance\".

The principal's behavior is being taken seriously by everyone here and OP's parents, but just because discriminating people for having physical deformities is not taken lightly anymore doesn't mean said discriminating ceases to exist, just like how racism is still alive and kicking even though it's been frowned upon ever since I remember; or how homophobia is still particularly popular with conservatives and people around their fifties who were born and raised in a time where being gay was seen as a disgrace.\n\n>There is no way someone with that much power would be so brain dead.\n\nGeorge W. Bush.\n\nPlenty of people with power do stupid things or are straight up stupid. Didn't Elon Musk, the \"Richest man on Earth\" just make the worst fucking financtial decision in buying twitter, a site that makes no profit whatsoever and was like 18 billion dolars in debt?\n\nA president in Guatemala didn't even know the goddamn primary colors. Nicolas Maduro is a communist dictator wannabe who's caused nothing but the fast deterioration and downfall of Venezuela.\n\nYet somehow a school principal being ignorant of what's morally reprehensible today is unrealistic? Besides, OP already clarified the principal was punishing them for the way they acted towards the other kid, but I guess 15 year olds aren't allowed to make a single mistake in telling their experiences and should be expected to be perfect narrators at all times lmao.", "Exactly, like that isn\u2019t a minor typo or some semantic distinction, that discrepancy changes things drastically. Like, if OP cursed out the other student and started screeching like a howler monkey, then yeah, I can understand why she might get punished. \n\nBut changing a key detail like that should make most people question the validity of the whole story.", "Yes, the idea of the president of a third world country not knowing what the primary colors are is not nearly as unbelievable as the principal in OP\u2019s story. One of the richest men and biggest online trolls of our generation buying up what is arguably the largest and most active social media platform is more believable than a school administrator punishing a student for not covering up scars on her face. \n\nAll of the racism and bigotry in the world doesn\u2019t come close to rivaling the sheer incompetence of the principal in OP\u2019s school.", "You don\u2019t have to believe OPs story. You can respectfully scroll on by"]}
