He left but today I was called into the office, the principal said I would be receiving an in school suspension for this week due to \"making your peers and staff uncomfortable with your physical appearance\".

The principal's behavior is being taken seriously by everyone here and OP's parents, but just because discriminating people for having physical deformities is not taken lightly anymore doesn't mean said discriminating ceases to exist, just like how racism is still alive and kicking even though it's been frowned upon ever since I remember; or how homophobia is still particularly popular with conservatives and people around their fifties who were born and raised in a time where being gay was seen as a disgrace.\n\n>There is no way someone with that much power would be so brain dead.\n\nGeorge W.

Nicolas Maduro is a communist dictator wannabe who's caused nothing but the fast deterioration and downfall of Venezuela.\n\nYet somehow a school principal being ignorant of what's morally reprehensible today is unrealistic?
