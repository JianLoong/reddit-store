Which she would be entitled to do at any regular job.", "I gave my opinion.  YTA too, stop being so confrontational.  We are all entitled to our opinions", "This was only the third week she was supposed to babysit (she's only done it twice before) so it came as a bit of a shock that she was letting me know so late. I don't know if this will be a recurring theme but that one Friday did cost me. The whole reason we came to this deal was because she didn't want to pay", "Sure it isn\u2019t uncommon, but had I hired a professional sitter and they pulled this nonsense, they would be looking for a job elsewhere. If it were just a date night or something, I could be more lenient, but the cousin caused OP to miss a day of work by cancelling so last minute so if it were me, there would be no second chances to fuck me out of money a third time. (The first being when the cousin asked OP if there was any other way besides actual money she could pay)", "Where was the insult? OP states in the comments that she asked the bride to give her a weeks notice if she wasn\u2019t able to babysit. The bride did not and this was too last minute, making OP miss work as other arrangements couldn\u2019t be made.", "Well right now they\u2019re not speaking to one another, so if sounds like the cousin doesn\u2019t want to do so anymore.", "The cousin is babysitter to pay for the cost of the cake and cupcakes not to balance the number of hours OP spent on making them. What kind of a logic is that?", "Cakes and Cupcakes are not charged only by the hours but quantity of work, so your correlation is incorrect. I'm sure if she charged her cousin for the supplies, decorations, time cooking, time decorating and set up, along with transporting them, they would be pretty even for 50 hours of babysitting over 10 weeks. I look as she agree to do a job, if you call work and said I can't come in today because my friends are in town, they would be pretty pissed and you may be fired. The op in this case had to call out of work and miss a day of wages because her cousin canceled last minutes...again to  see friends, I think her terms were fair and the cousin is going back on the deal. Op even mentions she is open to her missing a Friday, if she gives her enough time to find replacement, which seems pretty fair. I would say screw it and  just invoice the cousin for cakes and cupcakes and be done with it.", "Where are you from that people make plans with such short notice. Less than a week to find a babysitter is next to impossible.", "It is selfish. An arrangement was made and she was relying on a babysitter. The girl backed out knowing she had made a commitment. That is selfish.", "The cousin has been paid to babysit. She agreed to the days in advance. She agreed to OP\u2019s conditions of \u201ca week in advance for anything less than a real emergency\u201d. \n\nShe was given something that would have cost her actual money for free, in exchange for her time babysitting. OP was counting on her cousin to babysit as she is an adult and gave her word. The cousin cancelling last minute caused OP to not only be stiffed her payment for making the cousin\u2019s wedding cake/cupcakes, it also caused OP to have to miss work therefore the cousin has gotten free services as well as caused OP to lose out on money she needs to care for her family. \n\nHow exactly is it entitled to expect someone, a grown woman at that, to uphold their word when they know they\u2019re being counted on for something as important as childcare during a work shift? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me if this happens often or if this was a one off, the cousin still went back on their promise that they freely made in order to do something they wanted. IMO the cousin is selfish, a liar, and taking advantage of OP.", "Uh what? If it was an emergency then Ella would've said what the emergency was. You can't expect to say 'yes I want to party with my friends' and assume people will think that's an emergency. In fact, I didn't realize partying with friends was an emergency.\n\nNo, OP doesn't have to deal with that. Because she already did her end of the bargain and baked all these things for Ella's wedding. Ella needs to keep up her side now. JFC, whenever there's babysitting involved in any of these AITA posts you lot always jump in saying that it can never be the fault of the person not wanting to babysit.", "Not a \"we had a deal\" sub either it seems.", "This was a deal between cousins. One would make the wedding cake and cupcakes, the other would get babysitting in return, They got the cakes then reneged on the babysitting because they wanted to party.  what are you not getting here?", "But that's not what the deal was. The cousin agreed to the babysitting deal because she didn't want to pay actual money. Now she's got the goods and the wedding's over, she thinks she can just back out. Doesn't matter if it's one time or 10 times.", "Which means it's probably even more expensive for OP because she had to pay retail rather than wholesale for ingredients. Baking takes time and skill. Regardless of whether it's from a shop or a home kitchen, the bride got something of value and the agreed upon payment was childcare.", "Which doesn't mean it'd not of professional standard. I know more than one hobby Baker who routinely churn out high standard cakes. The process of doing it at home is no different to doing it in a bakery setting.", "Well they\u2019d have to go to a pro if it weren\u2019t for the aunt. I\u2019ll calculate on the low end, though, since they probably weren\u2019t elaborate. Numbers all off google so take it with a grain of salt. That\u2019s about $1 per cupcake, about $150. Average wedding cake cost is $450-500, so $600-$650 together. That\u2019s pretty close to your low end estimate for fair babysitting compensation. Then there\u2019s the transport costs and all the other little fees catering loves to add on.\nEdit: typos", "OP says further down that she originally wanted paying for the job and her cousin asked if there was something else that could be traded. In a further comment she also states that if her cousin wanted to switch a week (for non-emergancy reasons, like friends in town) then OP needed a minimum of one week notice. OP has had to take a day off work to look after her kid because Ella left it too late to notify her about wanting to switch weeks out. From that we can assume that OP used her own limited free time (because what working parent has oodles of free time) to make the cakes for the wedding and was expecting to be compensated accordingly. No real world job is going to let you come to them two days in advance and say you want the day off so OPs request of a week notice is perfectly reasonable", "But the cousin agreed! Nowhere it\u2019s said that OP made the cousin take the deal or that the cousin didn\u2019t want. You may not agree with the deal but the deal was make between them.\n\nEdit to add NTA", "I wasn't going to reply to this comment but I'm going to because you don't understand home bakers. It's usually a lot more expensive for us to source ingredients and decorations because we can't get bulk deals. We also have other full time jobs, unlike bakeries, so we needs to take time off or give up our leisure time to make these goods.\n\nAnd now in response to your Costco cake comment, I'm a trained pastry chef. I left my restaurant job after my daughter was born to go into a field with more reliable income. Just the wedding cake Ella wanted was quoted to cost $1200 by the bakery she first went to. Then she came to me", "But she didn't go to Costco or sam's. She went to her cousin and she needs to pay what she owes. She agreed to it. She understood the terms and accepted the goods. She doesn't just get to quit because it's inconvenient.", "Give it a try yourself and show us a pic. Good luck.", "If the cousin couldn\u2019t fulfill her end of the agreement, then she should have just bought some grocery store cupcakes. But she didn\u2019t. She agreed to pay the bill by babysitting. No one forced her into this arrangement.", "It takes a lot to bake and decorate a cake, as well as cupcakes, to a client\u2019s standards. Chances are it could be from scratch, so she has to pay for the ingredients of the cake, cupcake, and icing, along with stencils and decorstions.\n\nThen messing up even a little bit means redoing a lot of work. If you ever look at cake videos, they take hours to decorate and are only condensed into like 30 minute videos. It is also a lot of toll on the hands themselves to squeeze piping bags and use tongs, placing everything at perfect positions, etc.\n\nSomeone else did a rundown of the average market price of a wedding cake and cupcakes, compared to the babysitting hours. It was about equal. If they didn\u2019t want the babysitting arrangement, they could have instead paid the 1K+ for the wedding cake and cupcakes.", ">that one Friday did cost me\n\nShe was paying you with her work, and she skipped a day on very short notice, so you had to find alternatives.\n\nPresent her with the bill, and explain to her that every time she ditches you when it's not an emergency or bc she's sick, and you have to hire someone, she will be required to pay.\n\nOr, if she throws a fit about that, she can pay for the darn cake and cupcakes in full.\n\nNTA\n\nETA: and never accept the \"babysitting for baking goods\" exchange from her again.", "You realize her friends are probably only in town that Friday and didn't let her know until last minute, there was no reason for all the arguing, you can be pissed, but uoundidn't need to go down the path of arguing an insulting, should have just extended the babysitting by one more day and if it happened again, told her to pay since she can't be trusted to keep her word.", "Is 2 days advance notice really that last minute? When I worked retail pharmacy, we would have techs call out same day or even no call no show. Simply because they didn't feel like showing up that day. Is OP's child a terror or something? She really couldn't find a single neighborhood kid to watch her daughter with 2 day's notice?", "Because OP flipped their shit on them.", "Maybe it\u2019s just my family but plans are always thrown together last minute unless it\u2019s something expensive. It\u2019s not hard to believe that there is a possibility that these friends just randomly decided they want to come visit. And again OP doesn\u2019t state much detail. Does she not have other family that could watch her kiddo for a few hours? Where\u2019s dad? It\u2019s hard to straight up say anyone is an AH without information.", "It\u2019s rlly not but whatever floats your boat. This is why I\u2019d personally never make an arrangement like this.", "\u201cEmergency or something\u201d OR SOMETHING! OP doesn\u2019t say she does this often and if that\u2019s the case there\u2019s no reason to make this big of a stink ab it.", "[deleted]", "One time, not like she did it time and again, OP overreacted.", "I didn\u2019t even think about that. Plus rereading \u201cindividually wrapped custom cupcakes\u201d does imply that they were a bit cooler than uniform frosting. Probably $2 a cupcake at least.", "And she's not backing out of the deal, she's taking a day off. If this were a regular job, she would be entitled to use a PTO day for any reason.", "Well, for everyone saying Ella agreed to the deal, you also agreed to it. So to whine about not being able to buy ingredients in bulk and using time off is a moot argument. You agreed to the deal just like she did. You could've said no.\n\nElla is also not a professional babysitter. Since you don't seem to have easy access to babysitters considering you couldn't find a replacement with 2 days' notice, you likely would have needed to use a professional daycare for your child for the summer. Average rate per day in my area for a daycare is $179. So Ella is also saving you money. She took a day off, she didn't abandon you for the entire summer. To call her selfish and continue to argue with her is a bit much. I work in an industry where employees call out same day or no call no show. This could have been much worse.", "And she's not backing out of the agreement. She took one single day off. Everyone seems to be writing the cousin off like she's a scammer who ghosted OP. She gave 2 days advance notice (should be enough to scramble for a babysitter especially during summer when lots of college kids are home looking for some extra cash) and has not given any inclination that she plans to back out of the rest of summer.", ">she skipped a day on very short notice\n\nI would argue that 2 days in advance is not really short notice. The average employee does not give that much warning when they call out for a personal day.", "They had a deal. OP delivered on her end of the deal. It can be really difficult finding last minute childcare. Besides, why should op have to pay for someone else to watch her child when she already paid for a sitter in goods and services. While it's unfortunate that cousin hasn't seen her friends in a long time, she has an obligation to keep her word and hold up her end of the bargain.", "I wouldn\u2019t call friends being in town an emergency worth ditching her responsibilities for.", "People usually let friends know ahead of time if their in town.", "A lot of areas babysitters are pretty scarce. There\u2019s also the possibility that the cost of childcare would have been more than OP would\u2019ve made at work. It\u2019s not that unlikely considering many couples decide one parent will be a stay at home because it was cheaper than both incomes with childcare. This \u201cfree\u201d childcare was an agreed upon way of the sister to pay OP for a service and product they already provided. Do you go in for a massage and just say \u201coh I\u2019ll pay you after the next one\u201d? Because that\u2019s essentially what the sister did. Changing the payment after the service was already provided", "Most of us would have just insisted on the money, true but an agreement is an agreement. You can\u2019t expect a wedding cake and bunch of wedding cupcakes for free.", "Aside from that, OP has a child they are responsible for. The money OP could have made from the cousin could probably have went a long way for paying for childcare. Instead, the cousin herself asked if she could pay any other way besides actual money. OP allowed her to make a deal. If OP were just having a date night or relaxing, I could see not reacting so harshly being the best option, but the cousin got her services for free & then caused OP to lose out on even more money by cancelling last minute & leaving OP without the needed childcare so that they could go to their job. The job they work to PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILD. The cousin took away money from OP twice basically. The cousin WAS being extremely selfish.", "OP has clarified in the comments that she had let the cousin know she would need a week of advance notice for canceling for anything short of a true emergency. Hanging out with your friends is NOT an emergency and when you\u2019re grown, you should act like it & handle your grown up responsibilities instead of bailing like a teenager to hang with your buddies.", "Cool. Since you're playing the what if game, that apparently Ella might've been helping her old college friend who she hasn't seen in a long time with some unknown emergency no one else could help her with, I'll play it too. \n\nMaybe OP lost her job because she called out last minute to look after her daughter. Maybe this means that she can't afford to keep up with house payments anymore, and now they're homeless. Who knows. Because of Ella's 'emergency', OP is now homeless *and* out tons of money and time that she spent on Ella's wedding cake, thinking Ella was actually going to uphold her end of the deal.", "Interpreting \u201cMy friends I haven\u2019t seen for a while are in town and I want to hang out with them\u201d as a possible emergency is a stretch. If it was actually an emergency she didn\u2019t want to get into, she could\u2019ve said \u201cSomething came up, I\u2019m really sorry but I can\u2019t make it.\u201d If you make a commitment, and then bail last minute saying you want to hang out with friends, that\u2019s a pretty universal dick move.", "So you didn't even read about the deal. It was meant to be every Friday for 10 weeks unless an emergency came up. Partying with friends is not an emergency", "Not with only 2 days notice they wouldn't. And if you've worked a job that does I want to work for them. All my PTO had to be booked weeks, if not months, in advance", "She wouldn't actually.  That's what it means to do independent contracting work.", "You\u2019re the one saying that taking care of a kid and making a cake is not the same. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re asking to give an opinion on. They agreed that this was fair. \n\nAnd op had asked her cousin to give a notice with time.", "I'm not whining about it. I'm telling you to stop putting home bakers down and saying anyone could do it by watching Tiktok or going to Costco. \n\nI know I agreed to the deal. The deal was that I make her wedding cake and 150 cupcakes, and in return she babysits every Friday until August. This is about 10 weeks, so 10 days of babysitting. We made this deal because she didn't want to pay and asked if there was anything else she could do \n\nI also know Ella is not a professional babysitter. I, however, am a professional pastry chef (I said that in response to your comment about DIY)\n\nSo even though she's not a professional babysitter, I'll go off the professional price you gave (although it's lower in my area)\n\n179*10=$1790\n\nThe cake I made is worth $1200 from the bakery. I made around 140-145 custom cupcakes, all individually wrapped and label with guest names. Another baker quoted her $5 or 6 per cupcake for those.\n\n1200+(140*5)=$1900\n\nBy your own babysitting price I'm still losing money. And since she didn't come yesterday and I had to call a day off work, I'm losing even more.", "But it\u2019s not a job. It\u2019s a payment plan.", "Not always", "Absolutely, but there is nothing holding either one of them to this agreement. So it\u2019s not smart to do something like this. So OP did her part and now cousin can opt out whenever she feels like it bc in all reality NO ONE can MAKE cousin hold her end. So OP got taken advantage of and is now in a hole.
