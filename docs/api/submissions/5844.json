I make sure they always feel happy and comfortable, they share a room and each of their sides of it are decorated. I was alone with them and my partner for Christmas and it was lovely. \n\nOn boxing day, however, my dad came to visit without telling us he was coming round. He lives a while away so he mentioned staying the night in the spare bedroom. Which I turned into the kids rooms so I say he can sleep on the sofa for however long he stays. It all went well, he slept well and was warm, then yesterday I sent my niece up to run a bath (as they do every night) and when she came out she shouted down the stairs ready to send her brother up to have one. \n\nMy dad shouted for her to come down, she hasn't changed yet, obviously so she says no, which is fair enough, he keeps asking her, me, my fiance and her, reply no. I turn to my dad and ask why he said that, he's never believed in being naked around family members. He replied that he wanted to see how \"mature\" she was. I was discusted by this and so was my fiance. And for the rest of the evening, everyone seemed really uncomfortable around him. Then, when I sent the kids and told them I'd be up soon, he told my not to worry, he can do so. \n\nI said no, he can come with me, but not alone, he had a go at me for saying that. I nodded to my fiance, she nodded back and we both agreed to tell him to leave, he had another go at me for that. I passed him his coat and told him not to come back without our permission.\n\nIt's been on my mind all night, did I do the right thing? What if he was just being nice and offering to put them to bed?", "created_utc": 1672221480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx5u2l/aita_for_kicking_my_dad_out_yesterday/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would never have that man in my house again. I would have booted him at wanting to see how \u201cmature\u201d she is. Yuck yuck yuck. I would personally go no contact. Never leave that man around your kids. Your poor sister\u2026", "NTA. I have no words for \"want to see how she has matured\" bit.", "NTA. Not even the slightest bit. His words were inappropriate, disturbing, alarming, and disgusting. You did what you had to do to protect those children in your care. Kudos for that!", "NTA\n\nHe was being creepy about his grandkids, you were completely right to kick him out. \n\nYou may want to go no contact, or at least only contact in public places.\n\nYour niece may wish for more privacy than a shared bedroom soon, so you may want to be looking into making a proper divider between their sections - a thick curtain or some shelving could work.\n\nAnd good on you for taking them in and making them your main priority.", "NTA - I\u2019m super concerned about the predatory vibes I\u2019m getting. 0/10 do not recommend letting your nibbling children alone with him. How mature she was??? Oh fuck no. He can see how mature you are in protecting the lives in your care. Also he can see that from the window. Outside. \n\nTo add (and correct me if I\u2019m wrong) he sounds very much like the \u201cmy house my rules / i am king in this castle\u201d sort. You\u2019re well within your right to remind him of the same. Not sure how it works wherever you happen to be, but maybe also contact her school and make sure there\u2019s an approved list of people who can check her out of school/pick her up- that he isn\u2019t on.", "NTA\n\nPlease keep those kids safe from your dad.  That is nor normal behaviour or a.normal thing to say about any child, let alone your grandchild.", "NTA. Under no circumstances is \"i want to see how mature she is\" an okay thing to say. He shouldn't ever be around children jesus christ.", "NTA - Okay there is no way of looking at this where you are the AH, protecting your niece is your number one priority and what your dad said was vile. I don't think he should be alone with your niece and nephew at all.\n\nTwo thoughts occur, did your sister have a strained relationship with your dad? Did you ever get the sense anything was wrong between them? If so, you may have an explanation, as painful as it is to face. However, if this is behaviour out of the blue - and a couple of things you say makes me think it might be - then this is a red flag for potentially very serious medical conditions. You don't say how old your dad is but could it be possible that he's developing some sort of dementia? Inappropriate behaviour can be a warning sign, if it is health-related then it won't be the only sign, there will be others. Either way it doesn't change the fact that your father is not safe for the kids to be around. At all.", ">What if he was just being nice and offering to put them to bed?\n\nBeing \u201cnice\u201d? Nice? Are you kidding right now? Dude! There\u2019s no coming back from him wanting to see a preteen naked to check for \u201cmaturity.\u201d \n\nGo ahead OP,  it\u2019s okay to admit your dad is vile. Keep him away from your children. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou 100%ly absolutely categorically totally definitely did the right thing. For sure.\n\nDon\u2019t leave the kids alone with him.", "NTA 100000%\n\nYou did the right thing. He was acting creepy and predatory as heck. That \"I want to see how mature she is\" made my stomach turn. I would have kicked him out instantly for that disgusting comment. \n\nYou set a clear boundary to keep the kids safe and if he doesn't agree being in your company when interacting with the kids, it's his loss. Even the kids felt uncomfortable in his presence.\n\nYour fiance and you were really patient by letting him stay this long after that comment. You both tried to make the kids feel safe and get comfortable in their own home again and ultimately, protected them from whatever that guy had in mind.", "NTA- that fear, concerned and grossed out feeling you\u2019re feeling, listen to that. Because he didn\u2019t mean that innocently. And if you don\u2019t keep careful watch something can happen. Please protect those little ones. I\u2019ve had way to many times where I\u2019ve \u201coverreacted\u201d and backed off to be nice and had it backfire. Don\u2019t let him anywhere near those kids. Because someone who will say that about a little girl isn\u2019t about doing something to the boy either.", "NTA.\n\nDidn't Grandpa want to see how mature his grandson is, too? /S\n\nWhat a creepy predator of a man. Your niece is twelve, an age where girls commonly start their menstrual cycles, etc...\n\nGrandpa's not fit to be around any girls, anywhere, ever.\n\nEdited to add NTA.", "NTA NTA NTA. Gah I got the heebie jeebies!! I come from a family of sexual predators (never charged or arrested - family didnt believe in \"airing their dirty laundry\" and the abuse was never stopped) Please do not leave him unattended with children in future. You did the right thing.", "Nta - you are protecting those children by instantly seeing the red flags and your partner agreeing without words to kick him out. I wish more people were like both of you. Thank you for doing what\u2019s best for those kids", "Get him TF out of there. This child is not safe around him. I would cut all contact for this, and possibly report it to the police as sexual harassment.", "NTA. That is SERIOUSLY creepy behaviour on his part and you absolutely did the right thing.  \n\n\nAnd going forwards, you do NOT want to allow him around your kids unsupervised. Perhaps at all.", "NTA. If he'll try to come near the kids without supervision, time for restraining order, because that sounds dangerous.", "Omg I felt sick reading this. Ugh \n\nIs there a way to let some authorities know about this so just in case if something happens to you and your wife the kids aren\u2019t given to him or allowed to be near him? \n\nNTA", "First, I am so sorry for your loss.\nSecond, I am so sorry that your dad's sickening behaviour means that you need to lose another family member before year's end.\nThird: NTA. Thank you for protecting your children.\n\nQuestion (none of our business and you owe us zero answer): what was your sister's relationship with him? We're they close? Was she NC? Like, did he ask the same of the son? It's real creepy and I hate everything about what you had to experience here.", "NTA. That is something no adult should be saying.

His comments are concerning and niece was uncomfortable. Children can be abused and traumatized even in the presence of others.", "It seemed pretty random at first, then I remembered that my sister never contacted him, they fought a lot, I suspect something happened between them, and when they did speak it was only at events like Christmas, Birthdays, ect. When my niece and nephew were born she never went to visit him with them, and he only went to a couple of their birthday parties. He's never really spoken to my nephew as much and always gifted my niece with sweets, chocolate and toys. When I asked if anything happened at those events she said no and if there was she had no memory of it, only comments that she looked like her grandma (my mum) which I found really, really creepy", "My second thought was about OP's deceased sister, as well.

Even then she hardly spoke to him, not sure if something odd went on between them, though it's most likely", "Dad might have molested your sister and she stayed away from him/protected her kids. Now that she passed away, he is trying to molest her kids. Do whatever you can to keep him away from you and the kids. Never let your guard down. Sounds like he came over solely to harm the children and wasn\u2019t even trying to hide it.", "That's clearly grooming. You need to keep her as far from him as possible.", "It sounds like it, sadly. Please keep on this track and protect your children. If she was NC and didn't let him around the kids I'd respect that and trust she knew what was right. Good luck, and again, I'm so sorry that you have to live through the heartbreak of that loss. I lost my sister nearly 21 years ago now, and it will always leave a hole, but I promise it will hurt less frequently over time. Take good care of your family. \n\nAnd 10000x over NTA"]}
