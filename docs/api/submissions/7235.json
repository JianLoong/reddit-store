I tried to figure out what was going on and where I can help when she told me she was crying about her daughter and how she is doing in school. \n\nI love her daughter. She is the sweetest girl ever. I wish my daughters were as well behaved as her. I have to describe her daughter. She has a nice friend group, does not have trouble with bullies, and generally seems very happy. I bet you\u2019re wondering why her mother would be crying if this was the case. \n\nHer mother/my girlfriend was crying because her daughter is not the popular athlete cheerleader homecoming queen that she was in school. Her daughter marches to the beat of her own drum which I think is the best anyone can hope for. Yes she\u2019s a little bit dorky. But her own mother referred to her as a LOSER during this crying fit. She\u2019s very into anime(her and some friends actually started an anime club at their school), Pok\u00e9mon and video games. Most of her wardrobe is black t shirts with anime or video game characters on them. Again, she\u2019s a happy kid. She\u2019s got her social circle who all have similar interests. It\u2019s just not the circle her mom wishes she was in. \n\nHere are some quotes from her during this that turned me red: \u201cI never would have imagined my daughter would be a dweeb\u201d \u201cshe needs to grow out of this before college\u201d and my personal favorite \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead with kids that look like that\u201d \n\nI called her disgusting and told her she should be ashamed of herself. I said her daughter is happy and how would she feel to hear her mom crying about her perceived popularity. I told her how lucky she has it that her daughter doesn\u2019t deal with a lot of the issues kids that days have. \n\nThis ends with her being upset with me because instead of consoling her when she was crying, I called her names.

But no... definitely not the asshole. She is being an asshole and needed a dose of perspective.", "NTA\u2026but you don\u2019t need to bash mom with name calling to get your point across. Your GF needs to get over herself and quickly and you were trying to give her a reality check. You can say that you are disgusted by her behavior, that you are ashamed to be in love with someone who would be that selfish. Focus on your reactions, which is what you can control. It is up to her to come to terms with her feelings and choose how she is going to move forward as the parent of a high school daughter who didn\u2019t live up to her so called expectations\u2014but you can let her know your thoughts on why those expectations will court disaster if she\u2019s not careful. \n\nAt 14, her daughter is likely a freshman and has another 3 years ahead of her. As the mom to a theater/art/choir daughter who is now a senior with great grades and scholarship offers to amazing schools\u2014-being in the \u201cpopular\u201d group means nothing. My daughter has her core group of friends and they are the tight circle I always hoped she would have. These are the kids who supported my daughter when she began cutting herself in the spring of her freshman year and during and after she attempted suicide that summer. These are the kids who came to me because they were worried for her so we as parents could get my daughter help. I\u2019m like a second mom to this group. I take them to breakfast, bring them to concerts, played Uber driver until they could drive themselves. I know their families and I trust them when they are all together. You GF needs to dive into your daughter\u2019s world and enjoy the time before her nest is empty. \n\nIf your GF pressures her daughter to change, she will sow the seeds of resentment and distance, which is not what a parent wants during the high school years. Your GF needs to embrace and love the person her daughter is becoming, knowing that it will evolve and change each year. She may be done with anime by junior year, but that doesn\u2019t mean she will suddenly try out for cheerleading either. Your GF can either be the mother of the daughter she has, and help that daughter grow a strong bond with her as she becomes an independent young woman. Or she can sulk and whine and live each day with despair over her own dreams that aren\u2019t repeating themselves thus isolating her daughter and ensuring she will want nothing to do with mom because her daughter will pick up on that disappointment.", "Wow, that poor girl.

Cheers to you OP (THE BOYFRIEND) for accepting, supporting, and loving this child more than her ACTUAL MOTHER! Make sure the daughter knows this because I feel like it's only a matter of time before her own mother starts bullying her and trying to force her to be an exact copy of what she was in high school, if she hasn't already done so. I mean for crying out loud, this woman seems more focused on treating her daughter like she's a trophy child than as her daughter, and that's just deplorable.", "NTA - poor girl has an AH for a mother.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but your girlfriend is a big one.

OP, I hate to say this but you are dating an extremely shallow, judgmental, and conceited individual. Who complains about fat people being at a gym trying to better themselves and get healthy?", "Why exactly are you with this awful woman?", "I think it might be the daughter?", "And that's what concerns me OP. She's so self-conscious about what other people think of her she expected her daughter to be a mirror image of what she was back in high school just so it would make her look better. And then when that didn't happen she immediately start harboring negative thoughts and feelings about her daughter. That's not something a good parent does or thinks of when it comes to their child. \n\nI know you think that your girlfriend wouldn't go that far as to start making things difficult on her own child, but it's a very legitimate concern with a justified basis OP. Your girlfriend is obsessed with what people think that it's causing her to become ashamed of her own daughter. \"I wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead with kids that look like that\u201d couldn't be more clear in communicating just how ashamed and embarrassed your girlfriend is of her own daughter, and if the daughter were to find that out it would be devastating.", "NTA - mean girls sometimes dont grow up apparently.", "NTA - your GF needs to get over herself.

Inconsolable over her kid being different than her? Shit dude.", "> Her daughter marches to the beat of her own drum which I think is the best anyone can hope for.\n\nHonestly, that's **better** than anyone can really hope for. Being popular in highschool isn't a guarantee of success for life, and frankly an unfortunately great amount of people count that as a highlight of their life, because they peaked at that point and burnt out in college or got teen pregnant at a kegger.\n\n> But her own mother referred to her as a LOSER during this crying fit.\n\nThe only reason a parent should ever even **think** of describing their kid as a \"loser\" is when that kids a drug addict or a deadbeat parent. The only other thing they should care about is if their kid is **happy, healthy, and independent.** I'm sorry, but you've already earned an NTA from me for calling *this behaviour* on her part disgusting. The real loser is a mother who shits all over her daughter for not being someone she can live vicariously through.\n\n> \u201cshe needs to grow out of this before college\u201d\n\nSpoken like someone who was more focused on the party life when(assuming they did) they went to college. Speaking from experience? Nobody gives a shit at college. Like, genuinely unless you're engaging in a \"Greek culture\" college that just replicates the BS of highschool nobody gives a shit. It's a melting pot of different breeds of people from the highly clean cut to the person who is literally attending classes in their pajamas. College kids don't care.\n\n>This ends with her being upset with me because instead of consoling her when she was crying, I called her names. I don\u2019t think the crying means anything. She was saying horrible things.\n\nBecause **they don't.** Tears mean jack shit. There's this sort of societal perception that a person, specifically women and children, crying has some deep meaning to it. Like, their tears mean a grave offense on your part, but they genuinely don't mean anything. There are children, and even grown ass women(though more rarely of course), who will literally burst into tears because you sneezing in the same room startled them. This doesn't mean you did anything wrong.\n\nNow, yes, you called her disgusting while she was distraught. However, she was distraught over something that was disgusting. Her motivations were disgusting, her words were disgusting, and this renders any sympathy she might be deserving of because she's crying completely null. She does not deserve to be coddled for her horrible feelings. You might as well suggest criminals deserve sympathy for crying at sentencing. \"Oh sure, he killed his entire family, but he cried so really we are the real monsters here\\~\" Make that shit into an academy award winning movie\\~", "Mother's do tend to be their daughters first bully. NTA", "ESH, her more than you.\n\nName calling doesn't help in these situations.

I think it\u2019s a lack of understanding more so than her just being a bad person.", "Momma didn\u2019t raise a quitter \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02", "Exactly, although I hope you're wrong because that must be so hurtful for that girl to even have an idea that her mom doesn't approve of how she's living her life almost as if the daughter is making choices that anyone would find disgusting or appalling.", "I'll bet even money she's already complained about her clothing choices.", "Dweeb was way more popular in the 80s/90s as an actual insult toward dorky people. A 40 year old man definitely knows what the word dweeb is.", "It\u2019s kind of an older person word so it checks out.", "Not a native speeker either - learnt dweeb from the lyrics of Self esteem by Offspring in 1994. Now I've got it stuck in my head ... :) Anyways, just an example of use in popular culture back then.", "Oh ok, got it. I\u2019m older so I know the word. Your post makes perfect sense now.", "I'm 40, it was on its way out when I was in high school, but it was definitely common enough in the 90's when the Mom was in high school", "She is", "She made fun of and talked horribly about her daughter.  From your description her daughter seems self confident enough to be exactly the person she wants to be.  Her mother should be proud of her.\n\nWhat exactly is she not understanding? How can you defend her behavior? She may have good qualities,  but I can't imagine how any good qualities could possibly balance out this disgusting behavior.", "Doesn\u2019t make a difference for her daughter. Tell me - does it matter to you if the person calling you a dweeb because you have hobbies \u201chas good qualities too\u201d?", "As someone who is about the same age as the OP this hurts. It's true, but it hurts.", "As an older person I can confirm that we did indeed use the term dweeb back when I was in high school back in the late 1900s.", "Beauty is skin deep. \n\n\nShe's quite grotesque appearing with her thoughts and her perception of her daughter.", "And now we see how little that matters and how ugly she actually is.", "As a dweeb in the 90s, I can also confirm I was called a dweeb in the 90s."]}
