Breaking your things out of anger is a sign that she has abusive tendencies, so you should leave because that's a major red flag.\n\nAs for the money, I say just pay her back the money you didn't need to use as you help show her where the door to leave is.", "ESH. You need to break up. She was wrong for breaking the TV and you were wrong to overcharge her and pocket the difference. She really only owed you the current value of the TV, which I assume wasn't brand new. She didn't legally owe you a brand new TV.

She clearly has serious anger issues. Breaking physical objects is a precursor to abuse.", "What the actual fuck is wrong with Reddit?

I'm gonna make a wild assumption you're in your early 20s. Give her the remainder of the money and just cut your losses. This is not a healthy dynamic. Sure it's one fight mentioned here but I've had relationships like this in the past where things were destroyed out of anger and lemme tell you, it just gets worse.", "ESH that's an abusive behavior and you should leave, however she paid for a replacement and you're keeping extra money. (The money thing is ofc less bad than abusive behavior but you should just give it back and leave her.)", "She has anger issues and you have pettiness issues. Neither are flattering or conducive to a healthy relationship.", "Yes you are wrong. Items depreciate in value the minute you take them home, meaning it wasnt worth $500 any more.

You can charge her gas and time if you had to pick it up and the cost to dispose of the old minus that you owe her what is left. She definitely needs some therapy for that anger though.", "ESH, she sucks for having severe enough anger issues that she broke your TV, you suck for subjecting yourself to a partner with such severe anger issues. Have more respect for yourself.", "ESH and it's time to break up. She has anger issues and you tried to rip her off and pocket the difference between a new TV and a used one. Just leave, man.", "YTA if you don't give her the difference back. she was responsible for replacing the tv not paying you $500", "YTA. She gave you the money required to replace the tv with the same thing. You imposing a tax on her is petty and not appropriate. Give her the balance back.", "I suppose for judgment purposes, YTA and give her the money back, but only to get her out of your life. I wonder how different the responses to this post would be if the genders were reversed. \n\nTypically, if a partner breaks one of your possessions in a fit of rage, it's them showing you what they would like to do to you. *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft is written about abusive men, but if this sort of behavior from your gf becomes a pattern, maybe its themes and descriptions of what an abusive relationship looks like could be useful to you. \n\nThat said, I don't know your gf, and it's possible that it was a one-time mistake. I hope she apologized as well as paying for the new TV.", "NTA If your mother gifted you a brand new TV, it's not really fair to replace it with a open box item that may be defective, missing accessories, or have a voided warranty. You should wait for the order to arrive to make sure all is well before returning the difference in price.\n\nAlso let's be real here, if the genders were swapped people would be 100% calling out that violent partners often escalate from objects to bodily harm and that you should protect yourself. But they're too busy worrying about the girlfriend's money to care about your wellbeing for some mysterious reason, I wonder what it is....", "ESH\nShe shouldn\u2019t have done that\nYou shouldn\u2019t keep the extra cash.", "INFO - why are you staying in an abusive relationship?
