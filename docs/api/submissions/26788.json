They both sound awful and as his issue with throwing something at the tv is only financial, it could easily be that the angry throwing of shit is mutual.", "Great point. Which is why ESH. You don\u2019t arbitrarily rob people because they\u2019re abusive AHs - unless you are also an AH.", "Okay but that doesn't change the fact that you don't replace a used TV with a new one.", "I used to work as a court clerk. No, courts do not award you MSRP for a used item. The court would award the replacement cost which, in this case, was about $350.", "this is just straight up incorrect. if you total somebody\u2019s 2005 subaru do you think your insurance is paying them the 25k or whatever they paid in the first place? no because that\u2019s stupid.", "Sorry but you are incorrect. She has to replace the value of the asset as at the time it was destroyed, not the time it was purchased. \n\nTo give you an example, let\u2019s say it was a 15 year old car that was destroyed, not a TV, and the original purchase price was $30k, but the current blue book is now $5k. The courts would attempt to make the victim whole again, just like insurance does. As the victim lost a $5k car, not a $30k car, the damages they would receive would be $5k, just like car insurance only covers the current value of your car not the amount you originally paid.", "You've clearly never been present for a case like this. I have.", "She's just jealous", "Tried to steal her MAN.", "He has the replacement tv. Same model. He\u2019s not out anything in this transaction. What his mother paid does not matter.", "Well, if you want to do it out of spite, cool.  But it\u2019s still technically wrong.  So, maybe you are okay with being an ah in this situation.  That\u2019s why I am saying OP is an asshole.  He *can* keep her money, but doing so makes him a spiteful ah.  And it certainly doesn\u2019t help matters.", "yeah but either way the standard for emotional distress isn\u2019t high but an argument with your partner isn\u2019t gonna cut it.", "Thank you for your concern, but I feel pretty good about my judgment and actions.  I believe the best way to avoid being a victim is to leave the person who does inappropriate things to you.  \n\nWe just have a different view of what constitutes victimhood.  \n\nI think perhaps you still need to learn the difference between empathy and projection.  \n\nI do empathize with OP.  I just don\u2019t believe it is correct to keep money that doesn\u2019t belong to him.  If you do, your morals need be revisited.", "Nowhere because the person you are talking to is using the logic of a child.", "This guy Judge Judy's!", "...I'd ask where robbing people came from in this post about a girlfriend destroying her boyfriend's property (nice precursor to domestic violence btw) but overreaching to unrelated tangents is a time honored tradition here on AITA.", "You certainly do, anything broken gets replaced brand new. I don\u2019t go scouring the internet for the best deals when I broke one of my friends possessions. I send them the cost to buy a new one. That\u2019s what being a decent person to the people around you is like. If someone broke my 500$ tv and then came back with some 80$ box set from the 90\u2019s you bet your ass I ain\u2019t accepting that.", "How so when it was opened? Would the actual price not be more even if it was a tad bit older it wouldn't be 350? It was \"out of box\" how much would it be if it was in box", "Exactly. Someone's going to say this isn't an insurance claim, but the whole point of insurance, and equity for that matter, is to restore you to where you were before the loss. The OP only had to pay $340 for the TV, so the correct answer is that's all his GF owes him.  \n\n\nESH - she shoudn't have smashed the TV, but he shouldn't get to profit out of it.", "And I think you need to understand telling people to \u201csimply leave\u201d abusive situations is incredibly inappropriate. There are a myriad of resources to educate yourself with, but I have a feeling you won\u2019t bother trying to learn better. Good luck."]}
