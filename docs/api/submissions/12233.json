She tells me not to worry about it, but sometimes I can't help it when I randomly wake up at say 4 am to turn and see she's still awake just staring at the ceiling. She used to take medication for it, but it had some side effects so she stopped.\n\nMy FIL \"58\", I think he should just be called Mr Sperm donor since he did nothing to earn the title of \"father\", he left MIL (54) when my wife was 7 handing all rights, no child support, no visits, no nothing, just left without saying a word at night. She was so devastated that she, a 7-year-old would email him every day for 3 months asking him to come back, and of course, he never replied.\n\n2 years ago, he contacts Lia and guilt trips her saying he failed as a father, he wanted more experience and that he needs money since he lost his job. Lia has a good-paying job so gives him 3k, and wanted to rekindle their relationship, I was hesitant, but she said that he apologised and she now has a chance to have her father back.\n\nA week ago, he calls saying his new job required a trip to the city that we live in for 4 days, and to make \"accommodations\" in our home for him, she happily complies.\n\nContext, he is a real health freak, exercises every single day, does yoga very early in the morning, that kind of stuff, he knows about her insomnia.\n\n3rd day he's here, Lia slept longer than she did usually, sleeping from 8 am to 2 pm. It sounds bad but it's a big progress for her. Usually, on days when she sleeps like that, I let her sleep because she will sleep in for a long time, kind of making up for the loss.\n\nHe asks where Lia is, I tell him that she's sleeping, and this man runs up the stairs and starts loudly knocking on the door and shouts at her to wake up. I explain everything to him and ask him to let her sleep. He tells me it's not healthy and she shouldn't be sleeping in this late, I direct him downstairs and repeat everything I said in the last paragraph also adding that her doctor also encourages it, he doesn't budge, starts going on tangents, shouting to wake her up, until I finally crack and tell him to pack his bags and get the fuck out, he has a friend in the city, I tell him to go there, and if he doesn't comply, I will call the police.\n\nThreatening to call the police I guess did it for him and he starts saying disgustingly vile things about me and Lia, through the ruckus of it all, she woke up and heard everything he said and cried telling him to leave, so he did.\n\nNow her aunt, uncle and paternal grandparents are posting on their social media how he was only looking out for Lia's health, and how I'm trying to tear away a father and daughter.\n\nAll this makes me wonder what a stranger's opinion on it all would be, so Reddit, AITA?\n\nsorry for the grammar mistake in the title, I obviously meant \"AITA for telling my \"FIL\" to get *the* fuck out of my house\", I would like to say I was too angry to notice.", "created_utc": 1678734944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qinta/aita_for_telling_my_fil_to_get_fuck_out_of_my/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's the one who tore himself away from his daughter, first by his absence and then by his vile behavior and comments. He had no right to try to wake her up, and he had no right to get nasty when you told him to stop.
