We married at 20 and welcomed our beautiful daughter Ivy at 22. I welcomed our son alone at 24. Matt was the love of my life and that's something I'll maintain until the day I meet him in death. If he were still here, I have no doubt that we'd still be married. I have no doubt that we would be just as in love with each other now as we were back then. But Matt died before he could even meet our son Jacob. And I was so certain that I would never fall in love again after him. I thought there would be no one else, no other man that could make me smile as brightly as Matt did. Even when friends suggested I start moving on, or when my parents talked about this 'nice young man' they'd met, I never once wavered in my belief that Matt was the only one for me.\n\n\r  \nUntil I met James (42M) when I was 36. He's wonderful. Brilliant. I love him so, so much. I feel like Matt led him to me. I feel like it was his way of telling me that it was okay to move on, that I didn't have to be alone anymore. I feel in my heart that James is also the love of my life. He has given me four good years and I'm terrified that he's going to be taken away from me.\n\n\r  \nMy kids love him, too, and his daughter (now 20) loves me as well. We moved in together, he's helping Ivy pick out colleges, and we even have a baby together. James knows how much I loved and still love Matt. He's come with me to his grave, spoken to his headstone like they were old friends. He even told Matt when he was planning to propose.\n\n\r  \nA few nights ago, we had a celebratory engagement dinner. Matt's family were invited because they're still very much involved in my life and I wanted to share this moment with them. James and I both gave short speeches to our families, and in mine, I mentioned that I was lucky to have been blessed with two soulmates. Which apparently was the wrong thing to say, because I was later pulled aside by Matt's mother to say that she was hurt by what I said and that Matt would be 'rolling around in his grave' if he'd heard. Matt's aunt then reached out afterwards to ask if I'd ever loved him at all.\n\n\r  \nSome members of my family think I shouldn't have put it into the speech, that it was obvious I loved James from the fact that we were engaged alone. But I wanted to incorporate Matt in my speech somehow, because he was the father of my children and James approved of the speech beforehand anyway. A friend says I can't have loved Matt that much if I was moving on like this. Her partner died three years ago and she, like I used to, maintains that she'll never find love again. Another friend from the same group says it's natural to move on, that Matt wouldn't want me to be alone. \n\n\r  \nI don't know. I'm torn. I'm afraid that I'm really tarnishing my relationship with Matt by getting married again. I'm afraid that I'm not allowed to love James this much. I'm afraid that I'm an asshole for saying that they're both my soulmates even though I feel that it's true.

You deserve a happy beautiful life and Matt absolutely wants you to have that. A Happy life. Some people never even find one soulmate, you found two on your journey. It\u2019s a specific journey to you, others won\u2019t understand. You can love them both as you are and if someone has other to say, please inform them, \u201cI appreciate you caring, but for myself and my family that\u2019s not a healthy statement\u201d\n\nI hope you find some peace.", "NTA. Shame on anyone who feels like they have the right to judge you. You love Matt. You always will. You\u2019ve found an amazing new start with James, who BTW knows how you feel about Matt and approved of the speech. They may still be grieving. And don\u2019t know how to express their loss. But they have no right to belittle what you had with Matt AND what you have with James. I\u2019m happy you are healing and found both of your loves!!", "NTA at all. It was 12 years between Matt\u2019s passing and you meeting James. Not even the most judgemental prude could have anything to say about that.\n\nJames also seems like a standup guy. He gets it, and understands that it\u2019s not a competition.\n\nMatt\u2019s mom and the rest can go pound sand.", "NTA. I'm glad you found someone who, in addition to being very kind to you, understands that Matt will always be a part of your life. I'd be concerned about a live person being envious about a prior relationship with someone who's not alive anymore. There's no right amount of time to grieve, and no one way to grieve.", "NTA - who the hell expects or wants a widow in her 30s/40s to be without a partner by her side for the rest of her life. Saying \"blessed with two soulmates\" is a beautiful way of expressing it - and makes it clear that Matt is still a valued part of your life story, I cannot see what they object to when it specifically defines that.", "NTA you sound like such a lovely person and you see that you have been blessed with two wonderful men. \nYour new partner sounds like he is accepting of the fact that you were widowed and he has accepted how you greive and has no problem with it. \nYou should be happy and have every right to be happy. Matt was a massive part of your life so why should you just ignore that he was a massive influence in yours and you children's life. \nSometimes other people do bot understand when they are still hurting and have pain, they turn it to others as anger and try to project their pain. \nYou are not the AH.", "NTA. No one else gets to determine who you love. And you are so lucky to have found love like this a second time! (And congratulations!)\n\nI\u2019m sure that if Matt loved you like you loved him, he would be thrilled for you and would want you (and you kids) to be happy. \n\nYour friend and your in-laws don\u2019t get to tell you how you love. You are a radiant and lucky person to have this much love in your life!", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA. Would Matt want you to stay unhappy for the rest of your life? I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted that. They can keep their crappy opinions to themselves.", "NTA and follow the words of that last friend. It's natural to move on and Matt obviously wouldn't want you to be alone.", "NTA you didn't move on until 12 years later. You gave yourself time to process, grieve, mourn and heal. You were ready to feel loved again. Your new partner is not a replacement for your first, nor by the sounds of it is he trying to be. You went through something truly awful, and have been lucky enough to find someone that understands that and supports you and your children continually with that. It's beautiful that you have such a good relationship with your first partners family, and so nice for your children to be able to have that relationship with them.", "NTA. At all. There are different kinds of soulmates and you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ve been able to find them. \n\nHonestly, you need to cut Matt\u2019s family out of some parts of your life - maybe just in your moving on part, since they can\u2019t accept it and are making you feel bad for finally finding love. \n\nMatt wouldn\u2019t want you to stay alone forever. He would\u2019ve wanted you to be happy. And the fact you found someone who makes you love them like you did Matt, I feel too is a sign that he led him to you.", "NTA NTA NTA - you are allowed to move on and love again. It\u2019s not been a matter of weeks, it\u2019s been years. Matt\u2019s family are probably acting based on their own grief (and however they\u2019ve processed it) but you don\u2019t exist to be a memorial to the wonderful person you all lost. You\u2019re right, you have been blessed to find two great loves in your lifetime, and that\u2019s something to celebrate as you start this next part of your life with James. You deserve love and to be loved, and let no one tell you you can\u2019t have loved Matt enough just because you\u2019re not spending your entire life waiting to join him. \n\nGet married. Raise your children. Maybe one day have sons and/or daughters-in-law. Maybe even grandkids. Live a good life and when you meet Matt again, many decades from now, then you can tell him all about it.

The rest is just noise.\n\nCongratulations, how bittersweet - two soulmates in one lifetime.", "NTA. You are deserving of love, especially after such a truly devastating loss. What a blessing to have found a man who respects your deceased soulmate so much. \n\nMatt's Mom is still hurting, just as you are. She was out of line and so is your friend. They are coming from places of grief but you don't have anything to feel bad for. Please don't let this steal your happiness.", "NTA, but this is why it's a good idea to not involve Matt's family too much in your love life. James will always be Matt's replacement, in their eyes, if even subconsciously.  \nNo matter how you frame it,  for his mom, it will always feel like betrayal. I would still involve her in your lives, especially her grandkids' lives.  But don't rub it in with inviting them to wedding celebrations. Talk to them about it though.", "Your MIL does not speak for Matt. Her feelings are her feelings & it was cruel of her to lash out at you. I understand why she did it but it was neither kind nor fair. You cannot help her with her grief & you are not replacing her son. This is an entirely new chapter in your life. \n\nMatt tragically died too soon however his death cannot be changed by you living the rest of your life in the shadow of his memory. The best way to honor his life is to live yours full of joy & happiness. It\u2019s best to just ignore MIL statements & move on. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. Sometimes people just speak too soon & harshly without knowing what they are saying. Hopefully, MIL takes some time to reflect on her words & will realize she made this moment about herself ... not you or Matt. \n\nNTA \u2014 wish you all the best", "NTA\n\nAs painful as it is, your relationship to Matt is over though you keep the parts of him that remain in his children forever. You did love him dearly, and you also love James in a different way at a different time. It's unfair for Matt's family to get on you for moving on after more than a decade, and the fact that you have found this other happiness doesn't undermine or diminish the love you had for Matt.", "NTA, grief comes in different shapes. \nWe all move on differently and your loss is no less because you have refound happiness. \nWould the Matt you know, want you to live a miserable life without him? Would you have wanted that for him?", "NTA.\n\nI'm trying to think of what it'd be like to lose a child. I'd be hurt if I was shut out of my grandchildren's life. I'd be hurt if I was still in the early stages of grieving and little time had passed. It'd be unpleasant to be blindsided with a new person outta the blue. NONE of the above are the case by a long shot. Even if they were, I'd still watch my mouth geez.\n\nDid they expect James to never be a husband? Has Matt's mom had issues processing things or what? None of that matters I'm just wondering bc I can't imagine justifying her reaction.", "NTA. People are being ridiculous saying you can\u2019t have loved Matt that much by getting married again, at 24 you were alone did they expect you to spend the rest of your life being alone and unhappy?! Life goes on, Matt would want you to be happy not miserable it\u2019s perfectly possible to love more than 1 person in your lifetime. James is fine with it all and it\u2019s only really his opinion that is relevant here. Don\u2019t let others ruin it for you.", "NTA\n\nIgnore all of them. Talk to James and see how he feels. I bet he has no issue with what you said.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to love two wonderful men, and it\u2019s perfectly appropriate to honour the past while celebrating the present. If Matt\u2019s family can\u2019t accept your new partner after this amount of time, then they should never have agreed to come to the dinner.", "NTA, a million times over. Humans have an amazing capacity to love, and you've been fortunate enough to find not one but two great guys in your lifetime. Don't apologize for that to anyone. Just because you love James now doesn't mean you didn't (and don't) love Matt. At all.\n\nIf James has no problem with what you've said, that's all that matters. Neither Matt's family nor James' family has any right policing what you do and say. Period. It sounds like maybe now would be a good time to start setting boundaries with Matt's family as you move forward. While they will likely always have a place in your life, maybe it's time that they no longer have a place in your romance.", "NTA. Your speech sounded like a sweet way of acknowledging that you\u2019ve had a great love before James. What a terrible thing for Matt\u2019s mother to say to you, and your \u201cfriend\u201d who questioned your love for him is not a friend at all and needs to be ditched asap.\nPs. Congrats on your engagement!", "NTA.  No one can tell you how to feel.  Those others who are bullying you can't exactly find a replacement for their son or nephew (poor choice of terms here but I wasn't sure exactly how to put it) and can't understand how your feelings for James have zero reflection on your feelings for Matt.  Not everyone is lucky enough to lose a \"soulmate\" and find a second one, but that seems to be what you did.  You have nothing to be ashamed of or feel guilty for and as for Matt, if he truly loved you the way you love him he would be very happy for you, not rolling in his grave.  Your former in-laws are projecting the never ending sting of Matt's loss onto you.  You should let them know that you can forgive them this once, but if it continues you will not be part of their lives again.  No one needs to be bullied like that for loving someone.", "NTA. Aside from yourself, the only person who\u2019s feelings matter, or opinion matters is James. If he\u2019s cool with it, and it sounds like he is, everyone else needs to shut the fuck up about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you for your lovely comment.", "Thank you. Matt very much is still a huge part of my life and James accepts that. James' family have also been very accepting of the fact; his mom even came with me to put flowers on Matt's grave a few weeks ago. They all understand that I carry Matt with me. I thought Matt's family understood, too. I hope we can move past this. I hope they can accept that James is a part of my life now. We're getting married, my kids adore him, we have a child together. I wish they'd expressed whatever doubts they had sooner.", "Thank you for this comment. Truly. James is more than just accepting, I don't think I could have ever imagined meeting someone like him. He speaks with Matt's headstone like he would an old friend, and even told Matt of his plans to propose to me. Things he didn't need to do, but did anyway because he knows how much Matt means to me. I love them both with all of my heart, and I am so lucky to know love like this.", "Thank you, for both the comment and the congratulations. I truly believed that I was incapable of loving anyone else. I was content raising my children alone. But James as a happy surprise. I love him so much, and I know Matt would be happy for me. I know he'd be happier because the children love James, too.", "Thank you.", "Thank you. I didn't know how long 12 years was until I realized that my children had grown from babies into their own people. James from the start has made it clear to me and the kids that he doesn't want to replace Matt, but rather make his own place at my side. He is brilliant with me and my children and our grief. I am so lucky to have found him.", "Up until the dinner, they seemed very happy for me. They even came to visit when I gave birth to James and I's son. They brought him gifts and said they were happy for me. Maybe they were just playing nice for the sake of my older children because they do adore James. I think you're right though. His mother used to commend me on staying loyal to him while also asking me if I was thinking about meeting someone new. I should cut them out of this part of my story.\n\nI just know that if Matt were able to answer me, he'd tell me that he was happy for me, and that's what gives me strength on days like these.", "*over a decade*", "Oh gosh, thank you for this comment. Until meeting James, I was content with waiting until Matt and I met again. I thought I couldn't love again. I thought there was no point in trying. Then James, the big goof that he is, comes in and changes everything. He has made these past few years significantly brighter. He's given me space to breathe that I didn't realize I needed. Together, we've helped his daughter from 16 to 20, and my children from 14 and 12 to 18 and nearly 16. We've brought a beautiful little boy into this world. I wish more than anything that Matt had lived, that he'd survived. I will always wish him alive.\n\nBut I'm happy with where I am now. I'm allowed to miss him and be happy, and that's something I have learned thanks to James. So, I'll take your advice. I'll marry James, I'll raise my kids and we'll raise our son. I will go to Matt happy, with stories, and maybe I'll get to introduce them. Thank you again.", "Thankfully, James knows and accepts Matt as a part of me.\n\nThank you for your congratulations.", "Thank you. I truly believed that I couldn't love again after Matt, but James was a pleasant surprise. I hope Matt's family can come to terms with the fact that I love James as wholly as I did Matt.\n\nI won't let it steal my happiness. This is the happiest I've been in so many years.", "Thank you for this comment, I really appreciate it.\n\nI'm hoping she'll come to understand that I still love Matt as wholly as I did when he was here, but that I love James just as wholly too.", "I wish Matt's family had made their issues known before the engagement. At least then I could have tried to make them understand my stance or not invite them at all. But up until then, they'd been supportive; they even came to visit me in the hospital when I gave birth to our son. I'm not sure if it's the relationship itself that they don't approve of, or if it's the fact that I admitted to loving James as wholly as I do Matt.", "I know he wouldn't have wanted me to be alone forever, or even at all. As morbid as it is, it's something we spoke about when we were dating. I think it came up because someone in town had died so death was on everyone's mind just a little bit. I know Matt would have wanted me to meet someone sooner, and I know I would've wanted the same for him if our roles were reversed.", "Before James and I started dating, I went to Matt's parents to ask them about it. I was uncertain, even though I had people encouraging me to move on and telling me it's okay. But I felt guilty, even though it'd been twelve years. I didn't want it to seem like I didn't love Matt anymore. Because I did, and I do. I will always love him. Matt's parents were supportive and said they'd accept my new relationship. Matt's dad said I'd been alone for 'too long.' I introduced them to James, and they seemed to like him.\n\nMy relationship with James didn't change anything about my relationship with Matt. James accepted Matt as a part of me. He didn't want to replace Matt. In his eyes, I'm standing in the middle and the two of them are on either side, holding my hands. He comes with me to visit Matt's grave and even speaks with him. He told him when he was planning to propose. But I still visit Matt's grave alone, I still go with Matt's family and our children on special occasions. James respects this.\n\nI'd never want to blindside them, which is why I speak to them about everything. When I found out I was pregnant, I went to let them know in person and asked how they felt. We talked through the fact that none of us really thought I'd ever have another child. I know I wasn't expecting it, James wasn't either. I thought it'd just be us and the three children we had then. They came to visit me in the hospital after I gave birth to our son Theo. They were happy when I told them that James had proposed. It was just... like something snapped at the engagement dinner. I'm not sure.", "James approved of the speech. He accepts Matt as my first soulmate and as someone I will love and miss forever.", "I think you're right. I'm happy that they've been otherwise accepting until now, but maybe this was just too much for Matt's mother and her grief. I'll definitely be limiting they're involvement with our relationship in the future. Thank you.", "Thank you very much, for both the comment and the congratulations.", "Thank you. I know Matt would be happy that I've found someone that loves me and our children and accepts our grief.", "Thank you!", "I'll probably be doing that moving forward. As much as I love them and as much as they've been a huge part of my life since I was 16, I also think it'd be better to set boundaries for anything beyond Ivy and Jacob.", "Thank you. Other than certain members of Matt's family and a few friends (one from bereavement and others who have never experienced this sort of loss), everyone else has been really supportive. I know I should focus on that overwhelming support, but when the comment starts with someone as important to me as Matt's mother, I can't help but start to doubt myself.", "Thank you.", "It's been sixteen years now. I was 24 and pregnant with our son when Matt died. I was 36 meeting James. 40 getting engaged. I'm lucky to have met someone that allows me to love and miss Matt as freely as James does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.", "As much as I'd love for them to be there, I think you're right. I think I've found it hard to separate myself from them since they've been in my life since I was 16. I'd never cut them out of the kids' lives, but luckily my kids are at an age where they can make those decisions for themselves. Thank you.", "Thank you. I hope you've found peace.", "Thank you, I really do appreciate the comment.\n\nI understand that Matt's family are still grieving. I, myself, am still mourning him. It's not something I ever see stopping. I wish, however, they would have told me beforehand that they had any issue with our relationship. If so, I would have scaled back their involvement in this celebration. I'd never stop them from being a part of my life or the kids' lives.\n\nWith my friend, I do understand where she comes from, because I was much like her. But I never shamed others for moving on, which is why it hurt. She never said anything about others moving on, either. I was already dating James when we met, so maybe that's why she never said anything to me. Regardless, I hope she will grow to understand some day that I love James and Matt wholly. \n\nWe're not married yet; it was the engagement dinner, but I'll carry your congratulations with me to my wedding day. I know Matt will be watching over us, because I know that he would have wanted nothing more than for me and our children to be happy.", "Thank you so very much for this comment. It's brought a smile to my face!", "That makes me happy it brought you some soothing because you have been through a lot! Proud of you for the work you have put in to find that peace.

It's not a betrayal to Matt, and if he was truly as amazing as you believe he was, he would be overjoyed that you're happy and in love again.

I know that's cruel to say but they are behaving cruelly with you. \n\nPeople grieve and move on in there own time. Unless the person was selfish in their life, we can only assume they would be more happy to see you happy in the after life. Your soul mate sent a soul mate, and no one else has a say in that at all.

Additionally, many people in poly relationships will absolutely testify that you can not only have more than one soulmate, but you can have several simultaneously.

It's the person you commit to and honor. That's your soul mate. And if that relationship ends before both people want it to, your obligation was fulfilled. You said you'd still be with your beloved first husband had he not passed. He was your beshert. But life, or destiny, has led you to a new love, a new person you are committed to, that you share a child and a home and big beautiful life with. He is also your beshert.

I understand your new husband's parents being upset because in their mind your relationship should be just between you two. I mean, if you constantly brought Matt up daily to your new husband saying things like \"Matt would have ____\" I can see how that's exhausting because he might feel like you would prefer to be with Matt instead.\n\nIt's okay to still love and miss Matt btw, you don't have to forget him or act like he was never there.", "NTA.

Because I don't really think that matters on the time period at all. Even if it had been 12 weeks or 12  months and not 12 years, I personally don't think that makes a difference at all.  \n\nLoving someone else is exactly that. It's loving someone else.

It just happened, and it just happened in a matter of months. Not years.

She recently told me she regrets never putting herself out there to meet anyone else and focusing solely on us kids. This years will be 22 years since my stepdad died. While she did what she needed to raise us we all grew up and moved on with our own lives and I know she feels it even more because she's single. I told her I wished she'd have moved on as well and found someone to share her life with. When my stepdad died she had friends whose husbands died around the same time. They all had kids the same age so we had our little group that really helped us get through the first few years. Some have gone on to remarry and find love again and one other has stayed single as well. Those that moved on deeply love BOTH of their husbands.\n\nMoving on and finding love doesn't mean you ever stop loving the one you've lost. It doesn't mean they've lost their place in your life. It means you've simply learned to live with that piece of you missing and love others despite that. It means you've found room in your heart for more love. It's not a competition and love doesn't divide. We have an infinite ability to love others equally as hard, even if that love is different. I can imagine the love you feel for your first husband is more of a fresh young naive love that never got the chance to mature; whereas this love feels more mature and wiser. He gave you the best of himself in the children you share and left that mark on the world for generations to come. Who you were back then is not who you are now. Life has left you with scars you wouldn't have had otherwise. That doesn't mean one is more important than the other and it sounds like your fiance understands this.\n\nI can understand how hard it is on Matt's family to see you move on, especially after so much time. They're also having to make room in their lives for another person who is essentially taking Matt's role in your family dynamic. You are also no longer going to be Matt's wife but James's wife. He's not replacing him but he is taking on the role that Matt had briefly in life and even longer in death, and you can be both Matt's wife and widow and James's wife. They're allowed to grieve that. They shouldn't make you feel guilty or cheapen what you had with Matt or what you have with James. There's no comparison here and surely Matt would' be thrilled to see you happy again. There are two things that can be true when dealing with death, especially widowhood. One is that you wish you could have your first husband back and will forever mourn the loss of the life you would've had with him, and you can also acknowledge that without him you wouldn't be where you're at today and it's ok to be at peace with that. It's a bittersweet dichotomy.", "NTA. I lost my mom 2 years ago to cancer and my dad has found someone whom he now loves very much.

But then, through terrible circumstance or tragedy, he dies--and there's no more sunshine. No more roses. As his loss slots into your life you find yourself content with no more days in that beautiful, bright field. There's glimpses of those memories, sure, little refractions you can't quite hold onto: you hear the summer wind in your children's laughter, smell the roses in their hair. It's just not the same, and sometimes, it makes you miss that field of flowers even more. \n\nUntil one day when you meet a man who reminds you of campfires in fall, bundled up in warm hoodies and watching the stars as the embers crackle and burn. He reminds you of candied apples, warm pumpkin pie, and crisp, cold air. You realize you love all of those things. You realize you had no idea you loved all of those things. You didn't think you COULD love all those things, not after losing sunshine and summer. \n\nYou're allowed to love both. You're allowed to contain multitudes.

You never stopped loving the sun. You can't compare a campfire and a sun. They're different people, speaking to you in different ways, providing different things. It's never one or the other, it's both. It's always been both. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss, OP, and I wish you nothing but happiness in the future for this new family you've built yourself.

As you didn't date for 12 years, they never had to encounter that, so those emotions may be coming out very strongly, bringing back memories of when they watched you marry Matt. Being angry at you and accusing you of not loving Matt may be their way of making it easier. Doesn't make their behaviour right. But I wonder if it's necessary, respectful or kind to include them in everything. \n\nIt might be better to invite anyone you want to from Matt's family as a guest, and be clear they are under no obligation to attend.
