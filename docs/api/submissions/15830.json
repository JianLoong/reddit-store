I honked at her and followed her for 10 secs to a spot sign in the parking lot. She rolled down her window and ask, \"What do you want?\" I told her she hit me and she did not believe me and I pointed out the damage on my car and hers. Her paint was on my car and everything. She agreed to pull over and we pulled off to a clear part of the parking lot. She got out of her car saying, \"I'm just a little girl\" and started off apologizing. Saying she did not realize that she hit anything. This is hard to believe because both cars shook violently when the hit happened. She was acting very odd and was EXTREMELY adamant about the police not being involved. She seemed to be under the influence of something but I could not prove anything. I apologized for yelling at her at first but she was trying to leave so I was angry. I then just asked to get her information so that we can let the insurance companies hash it out. After getting my stuff out of my car I was concerned about her driving because I think she has been drinking. But when I turn around there is a gentleman standing there with her, which caused me to be on guard. This turns out to be her husband and he takes control over the situation, he also does not want the police involved. He starts by trying to give me the insurance information, while she gets in the passenger's seat and she buckles her seat belt. I tell him I want to get the license plate first and while I kneel down to get the picture I inform him that I will need to involve the police. I do not give him a reason at the time, but I wanted to involve them because I think she has been drinking and I would feel terrible if a worse accident happens after this and I didn't call the police.\n\nHowever, after I said I wanted to involve the police I hear him close up the insurance information, walk around me to the driver's seat of the car and they proceed to reverse and then drive off. I call the police give them the license plate and tell them everything including the video of the accident. They track her down and talk with her about the night in question. She says she was scared and she was fighting with her husband that night, so her husband just wanted to get her out of the situation. She told the police she was very sorry for leaving the scene and she is willing to give all her information to the insurance companies to get the car fixed and if they will not do it then she will cover the repairs.\n\nI chose to keep the charges in place mainly because everyone's actions have consequences and simply saying sorry or being \"A little girl\" does not make you exempt from those consequences. She is 24 years old and she was driving while under the influence of something. I personally think that this is a terrible choice and endangers others, if I let her off the hook I feel like that's me telling her that what she did was ok.

So it does not mean much, but I would feel terrible if she left and killed someone after.

But I believe here you are legally required to report an accident.\n  Also, failure to report a something like that with her being under the influence.

That is not a \u201clittle girl\u201d. That\u2019s a grown ass woman who clearly thought that she could baby herself out of the situation with no consequences. She 100% knew she hit you. Good on you for holding her responsible for her actions and protecting other innocent people from her reckless behavior. She deserves whatever consequences she gets out of this.", "NTA- she tried to manipulate you, and when that didn't work, her husband tried to intimidate you. \n\nKeep the charges.

She could have someone. NTA", "You sure this wasn\u2019t a human trafficking situation?", "Involving the police if ANYTHING seems off is total CYA. Not dropping the charges is totally fine.

You did nothing wrong.", "But notably, you had no evidence of this. And notably, you made this statement to law enforcement which may be proven to be inaccurate. Which is not good. You have also twice in the previous comment alone, used the phrase \"get her.\" Again, not good. Shows malicious intent. Well beyond reasonable compensation for damages. It's not your job to get criminals off the streets. That's up to law enforcement. NTA for contacting law enforcement.

Lady's car, but a guy was driving. Police found him at fault, but the lady tried to say I caused the accident when I didn't. Police report saying he was at fault cleared that one up real quick.

I saw you mentioned video, so I'm hoping you do. NTA. You did exactly what you're supposed to do.", "It's not about paying the consequences for what you did do, it's about the cops trying to pin something on you that you didn't do.\n\nA lot of innocent people are in jail because they \"had nothing to hide.\"\n\nI literally had a police officer give me the same advice, never willingly talk to the police and provide as little info as necessary.", "I mean, so does everyone... but shit happens.", "I have one!", "Front and Back if you can swing it."]}
