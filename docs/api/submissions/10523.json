And fake names, obviously.\n\nSeven months ago I, (29F) met \u201cJared\u201d (30M) and we hit it off instantly. Two months into being friends, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes, and since then everything has been almost perfect. He\u2019s kind, helpful, and very thoughtful.\n\nFor example, on valentines, he took me to one of the nicer restaurants in town, before driving me to watch the sunset and eat donuts in the back of his pickup truck, which I told him was my dream date a few weeks ago when he asked, which I assumed he had forgotten or was just curious about.\n\nHowever, for the past few weeks he\u2019s been living with me. He says his landlord raised prices too high, and he needed a place to stay until he could either buy a house for us both, or rent an apartment for the time. I let him stay, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that it\u2019s not his apartment, but mine.\n\nEvery day, I come home to dishes in the sink, trashes overflowing, and his dog chewing up half my clothes or shoes. I\u2019ve tried to explain that I need my house clean, as I work long days and despise coming home to filth, and he promises to do better, and for one or two days he does, then he slips back into his habits.\n\nHis apartment was never this dirty, so I\u2019m not sure why he\u2019s making mine a mess like this. He even told me he hates the idea of living in garbage or messes, but now he\u2019s doing the exact opposite of being clean.\n\nLast weekend, he had two friends over, (mutual friends, \u201cLily\u201d (28F) and \u201cCharles\u201d (30M) who we both get along well with) and they were both shocked at my apartment. I wasn\u2019t home when they first came, as I was still working. They told me that it was a mess, and when I got there it was the same messes, trash on the floors around an overflowing trash can, socks on the couch, and dishes on the tables and counter.\n\nYesterday I told him how I saw fit. I told him either clean up, or get out and find somewhere else to stay.\n\nHe lashed out at me like I\u2019ve never seen before. He told me I was being a childish ass, and I should be lucky he was with me. I assume he was drunk, because he went out drinking earlier with friends, but it still hurt. He told me if I didn\u2019t like how he was at his lowest, without a house and working multiple jobs, I can\u2019t have him at his best.\n\nI walked into my room and started crying as he walked out and left. He hasn\u2019t come back or replied to my texts, and our friends are split. Lily said he\u2019s staying with her, and that I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on him, but Charles says I\u2019m right and he needs to be respectful of my space, especially if he wants us to eventually live together full time. Some of our other friends have started taking sides aswell.\n\nFor reference, I work a decent office job, while my boyfriend is jumping between jobs, and having a bit of a hard time getting a full-time job, we aren\u2019t wealthy which is why I was open to him staying with me originally.\n\nAITA for not being understanding to him and kicking him out?", "created_utc": 1676954552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117un7y/aita_for_kicking_my_boyfriend_out/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's just using you for free lodging.\n\nTake this as a huge red flag and reconsider your relationship.", "NTA\n\nI am so proud of you for what you did!\n\nYou saw a red flag and you were smart enough to kick him out before ending up in more fights/trouble.\n\nHonestly, i don't know if you know his \"landlord\" but it might as well be \"his landlord was his partner\".\n\nWhy do i think that? Because he's a slob.\n\nAnd because if he had a cleaning lady, he would have paid her to clean your house too.\n\nI understand you feel confused, but you did nothing wrong.\n\nYou asked him to clean after himself. \n\nYou had an expectation he will be a good guest/roommate/boyfriend, especially after seeing his clean house.\n\nHis reaction to your demand to clean after himself or live elsewhere is the biggest red flag!\n\nIf he would have had real feelings for you, this wouldn't be his reaction.\n\nHe was beyond rude and it's best to lose his number - and the number of who else defends his actions.\n\nAlso, his multiple jumping jobs it's weird for a 30 years old man. By this time he should have figured out what he wants to do when he grows up. \n\nYou have good instincts! Trust them!", "NTA. It's unnatural to get an apartment messy this fast. Even then, he should at least try to clean up after himself, which he clearly does not. That shows he has zero appreciation for your hospitality. Also, jumping between jobs is usually a sign of laziness and bad work ethics rather than bad luck. Chances are he'd stay at one job (or two if needed) easily if he just tried. Helping people is good. Allowing people to leech off you is only making their problem worse.", "NTA, and good riddance.\n\nHe has shown you his true colors, and you should believe him.", "NTA change the locks and block his number", "Whooo, boy. NTA at all and there are about 20 different yet very, very troubling red flags here.

That is not a person you want to tolerate; I would cut your losses and him out of your life ASAP.", "I can't say NTA hard enough.

You\u2019ve given him a place to stay and he decided to repay you by disrespecting your home. Not okay. \n\nPay attention. This will haunt a long term relationship with him. This character shortcoming of saying one thing while doing another will come up like a bad penny over and over again. And make no mistake, the subtext is a lack of respect. People who respect one another don\u2019t behave like this. It\u2019s pretty simple. \n\nDon\u2019t let your friends weigh in on this. They have poor judgment if they think you\u2019re overreacting. He\u2019s being disrespectful and there\u2019s no sign this will get better. Imagine making babies with a guy who makes promises they won\u2019t keep.

I know I commented upthread- but damn. You dodged the biggest bullet here. \n\nThe reason he treated you this way is that he thought he could. You told him no- and when he stepped it up even more - showed him the door. I love your shiny spine!  Polish that up, girl! \n\nYou did the absolute right thing. Because that behavior is exactly who he is. The kind sweet man you were dating- that was an act to snare you. Feeling sufficiently comfortable that he landed a sweet arrangement where he thought he no longer had to put in any effort- his behavior reverted to his actual standard. \n\nThis guy is trouble with a capital T. That behavior is abusive- or at least headed that way with a Titan rocket strapped to it's back.", "NTA.  That was good self-preservation on your part.

Run and kick him out. \n\nHe originally had no where to stay and he\u2019s taking advantage of your kindness and relationship.

His behavior is disrespectful of your property, after you were nice enough to let him move in with you, and abhorrently self centered.

I doubt this is his worst, and when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time. \n\nPack his things and put them in a box on the porch.", "Girl,  you are dating a \"hobo-sexual\". I bet that wasn't his apartment you originally saw, ( probably couch surfing) and I bet he always preferred staying at your place. How can someone who is always between jobs keep a steady place? He's homeless. He \"love bombed\" you for somewhere warm to stay during the winter. He has no plans to get a job or a place, why would he if you're feeding him for free? Pack his things and send it to his friend's. You are not obligated to take care of a 30 year old man.", "NTA. Get out now when you can, OP!", "NTA he's showing you his true colors and things said when drunk...often a lot of truth in them. You are accepting him without his house, etc you're just not accepting him trashing your home. You should be lucky he's with you? Yeah, that is a major warning right there. Let Lily deal with him and mess up her house. Kind, thoughtful, helpful...that was a mask.", "NTA  .... run run run .... he's shown you his true colours.", "NTA and let him go entirely.

Your friend says you need to cut him some slack but it sounds like you already did. You asked him a few times to clean up after himself and he did at first, but then he lashed out instead of owning up to it. Honestly, it\u2019s only seven months and he\u2019s already majorly slacking off in the relationship. I say cut your losses, he\u2019s not the one.", "NTA. BF is TA. He has showed you his true self.

If he\u2019s saying \u201cyou\u2019re lucky he\u2019s with you\u201d that\u2019s a HUGE red flag. A good guy will always say the opposite - that he can\u2019t believe his good luck that you\u2019re with him. It\u2019s just how you want your partner to feel about you. Not this way, where he\u2019s a jobless, slob who\u2019s got no prospects but somehow you\u2019re still so lucky to have him - why?!

He\u2019s usually really well behaved, he just doesn\u2019t have many toys so he goes after shoes or socks or anything he can play with.

The way he treated you has no excuses.\n\nHe wasn't \"made by the drinking\" to insult you. He just lost his cool faster.\n\nFrom what i see, he's some kind of misunderstood genius, forced to work as any other usual human being.

It\u2019s just hard because I feel like he could be the one, like maybe it\u2019s just one strike, or I did something wrong myself, and if I just apologize it will fix itself", ">if he couldn\u2019t stay clean he would need a new place to go\n\nNah. From this i can conclude an opinion that your partner might not think much about his actions that affect you.   \nNow why doesnt he?...   \ni'm beting my 2 cents on depression. His current lifestyle seems unhinged"]}
