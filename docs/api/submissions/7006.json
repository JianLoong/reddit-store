She's on the spectrum. They were in a fast food place one day when a very new baby started to cry. The crying made his daughter cry. His daughter is non verbal is developmentally delayed as well as sensory issues including noise. Anyway, when his daughter started to cry he went around the corner to where the crying was coming from. There was a new mom tucked in a corner, trying to nurse her new baby. He brought his daughter right up to the woman and baby and said \"see the baby is fine\" but his dsughters crying got louder. He asked the already visibly stressed woman to explain to his daughter why the baby is crying and noted she was autistic. The woman was hesitant but explained the baby is just hungry. His daughter continued to scream while the baby continued to scream. All around a very stressful situation for everyone involved. My boy friend continued to stand there and asked the woman if it's OK that they hang around until the baby stops crying so he can show his daughter that the baby is OK. The woman refused. He got upset and stressed that his daughter just wants to make sure the baby is OK. \n\n\n\nWhen he later told me about the incident I just stared in disbelief.

Is daughter capable of understanding nursing?", "NTA - I agree with you, that poor woman. He just made that highly uncomfortable for her. If she was trying to nurse too I feel this would be extremely upsetting. His daughter may never get used to unexplained noises that upset her, but that's going to just have to be part of life as in instances like this, people can't or won't accommodate what he takes as a learming experience. He would be much better off teaching coping mechanisms.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nLike you stated, it isn't a random mother's job to try and nurture and teach another person's kid. She was trying to take care of her own child and was most likely stressed, so having a strange person and their child approach her while trying to calm her own child down was probably exhausting.", "NTA But god, your bf is and he\u2019s creepy.", "NTA.\n\nIf I was that woman, I probably wouldn't even talk to him, let alone feel the need to explain the baby's needs to his daughter. I get that being on the spectrum, makes you have some different needs than others, but he was harassing this woman to let him stay there with his daughter. She was uncomfortable with the situation, which means he should let it go. Yes his daughter is a priority, but other people matter too. If he really wanted his daughter to know the baby was okay, he could try to explain it himself. Not force a woman with a new baby to do it for him, let alone harass her to let them watch till the baby stops crying.", "Nta. And thank you for not indulging in your bfs bizarre  entitlement. \n\nI cant believe he had the gall to basically want to stand over the woman like a vulture just so his precious daughter can be calmed down.

That's just a complete misunderstanding of what would be socially unacceptable & a bigger failure to pick up on her emotional cues that he was making her extremely uncomfortable.

To much stress, too many hormones, not enough sleep for that shit. \n\nAnd finally...\n\nEveryone else in the place. This was so unfair to literally everyone just trying to mind their own business and eat.  Mom was in the corner, and probably would have had this under control momentarily. But she was cornered by your BF who drew the whole thing out and probably increased his daughter's agitation making what would have been a minor inconvenience (baby crying for 2 minutes) into a much larger nuisance.

Even if not, a few minutes of 2 kids losing it would have been exponentially better than this convo drawing it out)", "NTA", "NTA\n Your boyfriend is doing a great job of teaching his daughter that other people's boundaries and personal space don't matter at all.", "Good gods NTA. But your BF sure is. This is a red flag.", "I don't think his daughter cared if the baby was ok or not. I think she was having a sensory overload from the sound and responding in kind.

He should have removed his daughter from a situation that was obviously upsetting her as well, instead of taking her closer to the source of what was upsetting her.", "NTA. I have a nonverbal autistic child and when she becomes over stimulated by noises like crying I remove her from the situation and get us somewhere quiet to give her a chance to regroup. What he did was definitely a violation of that woman's privacy and I'm not even sure that his daughter was upset for the reasons that he thought she was. Either way you are correct it's not a stranger's responsibility to soothe or educate his child but his own. Chances are he was only making things worse by continuing to expose her to the loud crying and tension of that interaction.", "NTA. I don't usually agree when everyone tells someone they need to break up with their boyfriend. But you need to break up with your boyfriend. What he did was unbelievably inappropriate and creepy. And his daughter is 13 and doesn't go to any therapies? Think about the long term. Do you want your life filled with a creepy guy and his daughter that's allowed to do whatever she wants?", "NTA.

Now he says it first whenever we're out and there is an upset child.\n\nWhat they did not do is bring him over to the screaming children, as that would have been incredibly distressing for him, and force the other parents to explain why the child was crying.

He never has headphones with him knowing she has noise sensitivity. I don't understand him some times.", "We just found out that the little girl is 13.  That makes it worse in my opinion.

I would never drag him over to some poor woman trying to nurse. He's the smartest person I've ever known, but cause and effect isn't something he understands.

She has legal rights to certain accommodations from schools, public facilities & such. He does not have the right to impose his child on unwilling strangers.

She's now 13. I've yet to see her go to any therapies at all. He gives her everything she asks for and she never has any repercussions for her actions.

He believes school is for structure and home is for freedom. \n\n\nTyping out these responses really makes me wonder what I'm doing with him because I'm becoming more and more aware he's problematic for a number of reasons.", "I've never left my daughter alone with him just because it's clear he has an issue dealing with his daughter on her own.

What a vulnerable and scary situation for her!\n\nYou know, I was trying to think of a thing that OP could do to him as an illustration of how she felt and there's literally nothing because even if she tried to get him to explain something while he's peeing or whatever, there's not two kids screaming, there's nothing he has to learn to do for a baby that's new and painful to his bits, and he's not in public.\n\nI'm not saying dump him, I'm just saying *I* would dump him.", "I said that and he told me I was being dramatic", "Its pretty common for him to allow her to ignore/impede on others boundaries. I had a surgery on my leg and he allowed her to jump on my bed. He was in the room, right there 5 feet from me. And she jumped on my leg and he got upset with me when I screamed in pain because it upset her. I sucked it up because I know she didn't mean any harm or to hurt me intentionally. I'm still learning so I don't want to over step or do/say  anything that could potentially harm her or be ableist in any way.", "She's 13. He doesn't take her to any therapies.

Probably should have some idea about what he's doing by now.", "I can't even freaking imagine the horror of a screaming 13 year old and her father hovering over me and demanding that I explain what I'm doing and then let them watch me nurse (\"boob out\").  That'll be sticking with her for a couple of years.", "I would, too.", "Because she was trying to breastfeed her newborn and boyfriend drug his screaming child all up in her business.", "It\u2019s not her job to manage a random 13 year old that is unable to process something as normal as a crying baby.

Him straight up saying that his daughter is allowed to strike you is a point to walk away", "I would treat it the same way. \"No thank you. Hands are for holding/helping/gentle touching.\" And I'd get up and walk away if she continued.

NTA \n\nBut I do have one question to ask you, can you see yourself staying with a man who thinks it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s responsibility to parent and teach his daughter, who doesn\u2019t respect anyone else\u2019s opinions, and throws out the disability card where it isn\u2019t needed?

I mean who wants their child to stand there in distress? I think any rational parent would\u2019ve removed her from the situation. But instead, He literally sought this women out\u2026 went and found her around the corner. His daughter was distressed by the noise and so he brought her \u2026.closer to it? Yeahhhhh.

Guarantee- you are going to feel like his parent and hers, and that's a biiiig job.", "NTA Mom of a young adult on the spectrum here, so I\u2019ve been at this for years. This teenager is being done a great disservice. Dad doesn\u2019t want to be the bad guy. Guess what ? Parenting is HARD. She is going to hit the wrong person and the consequences could be quite severe. Home IS the place to learn self-control and common courtesy. I\u2019ve worked very hard to help my son integrate into society. He is verbal , so that helps. I\u2019ve used every service available to us. He is a happy young man with friends and a bright independent future. But it takes patience, and the ability to think on your feet.", ">He believes school is for structure and home is for freedom.\n\nThat's another part of his problem. Autism thrives on structure. My partner was diagnosed at 7, and the best time of his life was when he had strict structural consistency. He *knew* snacks would be available at 3 and he could get his grape juice. He *knew* he had to be up at 7. If we have plans and something disrupts what we have planned, even for like 5 minutes, we both get thrown out of whack and the rest of the day is tanked. Honestly, it's probably part of why she has those angry outbursts.\n\nHer dad's insistence on a lack of structure at home is very detrimental to her, and clearly he isn't willing to fix that, and that sucks. If he wants to like, have structured unstructured time? Like, two or so hours where she can do whatever, but then she's back on schedule for everything else? That might be fine. That's two hours she *knows* she can do whatever, but then she also knows the rest of the time is things she needs to do, like homework or chores or dinner.", "Poor kid.

There is zero chance that his 13(?!) year old has never heard a baby cry before.

I thought it was a valid argument but I suppose it's not really if he's not properly assisting his child to grow.", "It sounds like he was looking for this woman to solve the crying of his daughter. He hasn't taken the time to understand his kid and learn how to take care of her, so he is expecting a random woman to just placate her so he doesn't have to listen to the crying", "He was thinking \u201ccan someone shut up my kid for me?\u201d And possibly \u201cbooooobs!\u201d I\u2019m not *saying* your boyfriend is a perv, but that mother definitely thought he was. That poor woman. Instead of harassing that poor new mom, he should\u2019ve removed his daughter from the situation.

So he would clearly never protect your daughter when his daughter hurts her, and he would make her feel wronged for expressing pain, or wanting to avoid a situation where she would get hurt.\n\nHe already said he wants your daughter around so she could be an unpaid caregiver. Even if you couldn\u2019t find someone better (Ha ha ha) *your responsibility as a parent is to give your child a safe home.* This is not a safe relationship or environment for your daughter.", "Let\u2019s put it this way. You accidentally get pregnant. If you decide to keep the baby, it makes sense for him to live with you so he could coparent.

She should thank me for providing this opportunity to enhance the life of a *child with special needs*\" \n\nActually after typing all that out, sounds like he's a bit on the spectrum himself - if he doesn't realize how much his insisting on standing there, ignoring his melting down child, makes him an unredeemable creep. He recounted the entire thing to his current girlfriend, I think he's just missing *all* those clues PLUS coming from a privileged male perspective of \"totally okay to fob off childcare tasks on any available female within sight\" \n\nI'd be reeeal wary of what life with this dude might look like for OP, in the long term.", "He makes a lot of passing comments about how my daughter is so helpful to her so part of me thinks he thinks my child is going to be her care provider.
