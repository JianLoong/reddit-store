She's on the spectrum. They were in a fast food place one day when a very new baby started to cry. The crying made his daughter cry. His daughter is non verbal is developmentally delayed as well as sensory issues including noise. Anyway, when his daughter started to cry he went around the corner to where the crying was coming from. There was a new mom tucked in a corner, trying to nurse her new baby. He brought his daughter right up to the woman and baby and said \"see the baby is fine\" but his dsughters crying got louder. He asked the already visibly stressed woman to explain to his daughter why the baby is crying and noted she was autistic. The woman was hesitant but explained the baby is just hungry. His daughter continued to scream while the baby continued to scream. All around a very stressful situation for everyone involved. My boy friend continued to stand there and asked the woman if it's OK that they hang around until the baby stops crying so he can show his daughter that the baby is OK. The woman refused. He got upset and stressed that his daughter just wants to make sure the baby is OK. \n\n\n\nWhen he later told me about the incident I just stared in disbelief.

I don't feel I am, I feel he was insensitive towards the woman and her new baby and I feel he's entitled for thinking the woman should have taken the time and allowed them to just stand there and watch her nurse when she clearly was trying to hide from people.

Is daughter capable of understanding nursing?", "NTA - I agree with you, that poor woman. He just made that highly uncomfortable for her. If she was trying to nurse too I feel this would be extremely upsetting. His daughter may never get used to unexplained noises that upset her, but that's going to just have to be part of life as in instances like this, people can't or won't accommodate what he takes as a learming experience. He would be much better off teaching coping mechanisms.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nLike you stated, it isn't a random mother's job to try and nurture and teach another person's kid.

I get that being on the spectrum, makes you have some different needs than others, but he was harassing this woman to let him stay there with his daughter. She was uncomfortable with the situation, which means he should let it go. Yes his daughter is a priority, but other people matter too. If he really wanted his daughter to know the baby was okay, he could try to explain it himself. Not force a woman with a new baby to do it for him, let alone harass her to let them watch till the baby stops crying.", "Nta. And thank you for not indulging in your bfs bizarre  entitlement. \n\nI cant believe he had the gall to basically want to stand over the woman like a vulture just so his precious daughter can be calmed down.

That's just a complete misunderstanding of what would be socially unacceptable & a bigger failure to pick up on her emotional cues that he was making her extremely uncomfortable.

To much stress, too many hormones, not enough sleep for that shit. \n\nAnd finally...\n\nEveryone else in the place. This was so unfair to literally everyone just trying to mind their own business and eat.  Mom was in the corner, and probably would have had this under control momentarily. But she was cornered by your BF who drew the whole thing out and probably increased his daughter's agitation making what would have been a minor inconvenience (baby crying for 2 minutes) into a much larger nuisance.

Even if not, a few minutes of 2 kids losing it would have been exponentially better than this convo drawing it out)", "NTA", "NTA\n Your boyfriend is doing a great job of teaching his daughter that other people's boundaries and personal space don't matter at all.", "Good gods NTA.

I have a nonverbal autistic child and when she becomes over stimulated by noises like crying I remove her from the situation and get us somewhere quiet to give her a chance to regroup. What he did was definitely a violation of that woman's privacy and I'm not even sure that his daughter was upset for the reasons that he thought she was. Either way you are correct it's not a stranger's responsibility to soothe or educate his child but his own. Chances are he was only making things worse by continuing to expose her to the loud crying and tension of that interaction.", "NTA. I don't usually agree when everyone tells someone they need to break up with their boyfriend. But you need to break up with your boyfriend. What he did was unbelievably inappropriate and creepy. And his daughter is 13 and doesn't go to any therapies? Think about the long term. Do you want your life filled with a creepy guy and his daughter that's allowed to do whatever she wants?", "NTA.

Now he says it first whenever we're out and there is an upset child.\n\nWhat they did not do is bring him over to the screaming children, as that would have been incredibly distressing for him, and force the other parents to explain why the child was crying.

I would never drag him over to some poor woman trying to nurse. He's the smartest person I've ever known, but cause and effect isn't something he understands.

She has legal rights to certain accommodations from schools, public facilities & such. He does not have the right to impose his child on unwilling strangers.

She's now 13. I've yet to see her go to any therapies at all. He gives her everything she asks for and she never has any repercussions for her actions.

He believes school is for structure and home is for freedom. \n\n\nTyping out these responses really makes me wonder what I'm doing with him because I'm becoming more and more aware he's problematic for a number of reasons.", "I've never left my daughter alone with him just because it's clear he has an issue dealing with his daughter on her own.

That shit is weird and not okay, like at all. \n\nAs someone with autism I will give u this advice and I recommend you share it since it's pretty obvious he has no clue what he's doing. Loud sound hurts, bright lights hurt, touch sometimes hurts, being too hot hurts. When these things hurt it is called over stimulation and what is best to do when this is happening is take them to somewhere dim and quiet. If that is not feasible bringing the child a comfort item that soothes them will help. A texture they like is probably best. A lot of things that both make us mad and happy as autistic people have to do with texture. Most foods that we don't like it's because of texture, not flavor. \n\nAlso I would recommend working out hand signals to tell u guys when these things are happening, maybe covering her ears for too loud? Things like that. She has the capabilities to be incredibly intelligent but she just is having trouble communicating in the normal way. It does not mean she can not communicate. Find a way that's best for her. \n\nAnother piece of advice when raising someone on the spectrum, if we know why something needs to happen we are way more likely to do it. If we understand why a rule is there we follow it, if we understand why we are doing this thing we do it. Takeing the extra time to explain why the one or two times will be way easier than the fighting every time it comes up in the future. \n\nAlso, being autistic is not a deformity or a disability. It is a brain structure that makes up like 40% of the population. She just has a different brain type so some things are different, especially when it comes to social cues. She needs to be understood, not coddled. There is a difference and she will thank you later in life for knowing it. \n\nP.S autism is genetic so it had to come from somewhere. just saying. lol\n\nHope this helps, U gotta give the guy props for trying tho.", "NTA!

She is not safe with him, and neither are you or your daughter, OP.", "my mom when she had her last kid my youngest sister had a boy who was 9, me who was 4(a month from being 5), a boy who was 2(a month from being 3), and a boy who was 11 months. she said she doesn\u2019t know how she made it thru that, especially because all of us had colic. it was hard for all of us kids too just constant crying. and when one would cry, at least for us four littles, the rest would cry. fuck that. i want kids but it\u2019s not the same unless it\u2019s your bundles of joy"]}
