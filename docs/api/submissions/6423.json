It's not a thing in NZ at all, noone tips on UberEATS or anywhere else. I just assume that's there because of America needing to tip as they don't pay people a livable wage.", "I always put a basic tip before placing the order and most of the time increase it (or in a case like this, if a driver is rude or doesn\u2019t do their job, decrease it) depending on the service I receive. I think you\u2019re NTA but when you\u2019re using a service where they rely heavily on tips for income you should expect this kind of sentiment.\n\nEdited to add that in every case I\u2019ve experienced, the restaurant packs up the meal and tapes the bags shut before the driver ever arrives. I\u2019m not sure he would have known the sauces weren\u2019t there if he didn\u2019t open the bags and check.", "NTA I also always tip after service, it\u2019s the normal way to do things I think", "Info? Was the bag closed and stapled when the driver delivered it?\n\nBecause if it was, then y t a. The restaurant is at fault. The driver shouldn't be fingering through your bag to make sure the restaurant is doing their job. \n\nEven if it wasn't stapled, same principal applies... So YTA \n\nYou're correct to say tipping is standard AFTER, but it sounds like you were just testing the driver. You should have shown a tip on the order if you really wanted all your sauces.\n\nGranted, if I were the driver, I would make sure to ask the restaurant that everything on the order was in the bag but I've been a server/bartender for a long time.\n\nSimple fact is, your order could have just sat there and NOBODY would have delivered it... because correct me if I'm wrong, drivers get to choose which orders they deliver... \n\nSo, you're lucky a driver even picked up your order and delivered it to you. For that simple fact, you should have tipped cash", "Unless uber eats works differently in the UK, the tip you select at payment is just a projection. You can adjust it after you receive your order. Waiting to tip probably just made the driver assume you wouldn't do it at all, so I can see why they might think YTA in the moment even if you would have tipped later.\n\nETA: Also you seem to be assuming that a restaurant screwup is the fault of the driver, which, no.", "YTA. The delivery driver has one job, to deliver the food from the restaurant to you, and he did 100% of the parts within his control correctly. Your explanation for why you wait to tip until after makes no sense because your tip to the driver should not change if the restaurant messed up, because it\u2019s not in the drivers control. The driver does not work for the restaurant and get tipped out at the end of the night. Base pay is vanishingly small for each order, barely enough to cover gas, so the tip you pay IS the driver\u2019s only pay. So in answer to your question about why you would tip before receiving your items, you tip when you order so that someone will pick up your order and bring it quickly and be nice to you - because they know they are getting paid. However, none of that will affect the restaurant forgetting your sauces - because the drivers literally aren\u2019t ALLOWED to open the sealed bags to check the items. Getting sauces on a delivery order is risky and it doesn\u2019t always happen. Grab some extras next time you\u2019re in the restaurant in person and keep them in a drawer in your house for next time you get delivery.", "YTA.  The Uber Eats or Door Dash driver is literally just a courier, they have nothing to do with packing your order and including utensils, napkins, sauces, etc.   The restaurant you order from is responsible for that.   You're tipping the driver for transporting the food to you, and that's it.  \n\nAt least in the US, Uber Eats and Door Dash drivers are not supposed to open your bags to check that the order is correct - several fast food places even have special stickers to close the bags to prevent removal of items or handling of the customer's food.", "YTA, first drivers are not supposed to open the container and inspect your food so if the order is wrong, that's on McDonald's not on the driver. Your food probably also sits for a long time because no one wants to take a no tip order and eventually they will group your order with another that did tip. Drivers don't make much and rely on tips. Place a tip and if service is great increase the tip or go get the food yourself", "NTA - I think a lot of the ytas are not from the UK. Generally speaking tipping is not a big thing here, I honestly mainly see it with taxis when your fare is like \u00a37.50, you had them a tenner and say keep the change. Its honestly something I really don't want coming over from USA culture due to the exploitation and bad stories I read in regard to it.\n\nPlus, when I have tipped delivery drivers, it has also genuinely been at the door when the food arrives on time or giving them a fiver on unsociable nights such as Christmas eve.\n\nBut - judge based on the timeliness of the order next time, any missing items from a clearly untampered bag is on the restaurant and you should take it up with them, particularly with a 3rd party delivery company. \n\nSolution - and by God its a controversial one hold onto your hats - liveable wages should be common place. Not something unreliable and open to exploitation as tips.", "YTA\n\nIt's not the driver's fault it's the restaurant's. The only recourse that makes sense is to not order from there again. Driver should still get some kind of tip.", "YTA, the driver only picks up the order, the restaurant puts it together and it's their fault if it's wrong, not the order. \n\nOnly time I didn't tip a delivery driver was when they didn't deliver the order to the right place,  they left a couple of different orders at one house.", "YTA \n You aren't tipping him for your order, you are tipping him for the convenience of him bringing it to you. The fact that you don't want a tip because the workers at the store didn't give you dip is ridiculous. You want to punish someone who had absolutely nothing to do with that and who was taking on wear and tear to their vehicle to bring you your order. Not to mention that it's more dangerous to deliver at night.", "YTA all the driver does is pick up the food. It isn\u2019t their fault the order is wrong. The driver still performed his service for you though. You should have tipped, then gone on the app and reported the problem. Under the help section there is a help with order button where you can get a partial refund for an order being messed up. Don\u2019t stiff the driver though for something that isn\u2019t in their control. Most places seal the food so its not even like the driver could have checked to make sure the entire order was there.", "YTA if an item is missing from your order, it\u2019s because of the restaurant. Blaming the delivery driver is like blaming the post office for your package having an item missing. \n\nThey didn\u2019t do anything but bring it to you.", "NTA people didn't fully read when you said he told you \"you sould of tip\" meaning he took it", "NTA. You\u2019re not in the US so shouldn\u2019t need to tip at all. \n\nAnd even if you do, tip should always be after service, not before.", "Yta\n\nThe problem is the restaurant, not the driver. The driver isn\u2019t allowed to check the contents of your bag to ensure everything is there. Also some sauce packets isn\u2019t worth not tipping.", "YTA.  Order screwups are on the restaurant, not the driver.  The drivers merely pick up the food and deliver it.  The tip is for the service provided which the driver did.", "YTA - you can always change your tip after it\u2019s received, but the driver has nothing to do with your order being correct. Drivers can see something about how much you plan to tip, I believe. I\u2019m US-based, but I\u2019ve heard this from people who have driven for these companies before. Some drivers will probably even not choose a delivery without a tip.", "YTA\n\nI don't like it, but I understand why it's necessary.  It's not the driver's fault for the lack of dips.", "Nah. Wanting to see what kind of service you get before tipping makes complete sense to me. After all of you go to a restaurant you don't give the tip to your server when you first get seated - you do it at the end of your meal.\n\nHowever if you are doing Uber Eats it is not the driver that packs your order. Unless it is something they could reasonably be expected to notice (one drink when you ordered two or something like that), they have no way of knowing the order is wrong. Don't punish people for things outside of their control.", "NTA. In any rational country, tipping is something a customer chooses to do, to show appreciation for exceptional service. Not doing the damn job. Paying their drivers is Uber\u2019s responsibility and every time we accept the USA\u2019s hell scape of a social contract we normalise it. Resist!", "NAH Okay, so the driver didn't need to be snarky. But, to be completely clear, the driver has NOTHING to do with the dips, so it's not fair to punish him for that. The restaurant prepares the order in full, and bags are sealed at most places (do they not do that in the UK? That's a new one for me). They don't check the food, they're not supposed to either.\n\nIf you don't leave a tip because of an error made on the restaurant's end, you are an asshole.\n\nIf you don't tip on a delivery order from sites like DoorDash, you are an asshole (that money you pay Doordash and similar sites goes to the site, VERY little goes to the drivers).", "Yta for treating the driver poorly for just delivering. Unless it\u2019s a shit food place, all orders are sealed by the restaurant beforehand. It is the stores fault for missing items, not the dasher 99% of the time. If they were late or rude or did the job wrong it may be different. Drivers consider tips a \u201cbid\u201d for an order. The higher or more reasonable the tip, the more likely a driver is going to do their best to get your order to you on time. Spend 5 seconds on the dd, ue, or gh Reddit pages to see how the drivers see it. It\u2019s still shitty the companies make drivers rely on tips for low wages, but no need to hurt a drivers ratings over something that isn\u2019t their fault", "YTA. Drivers won\u2019t go the extra mile for $0. As far as he knew you were a cheapskate and drivers take on all the expenses of delivery. (Car maintenance, gas, insurance etc)", "YTA - if you can\u2019t afford to tip then either go get the food yourself, or cook at home.", "NTA, I do the same. If they get the food to me within a normal time and don\u2019t have any items missing they\u2019ll get a tip from me. I started doing that after drivers took forever to get my order to me and the food being cold by the time it got to me.", "You know I really hate the whole tip culture crap. Nta I\u2019m with you you tipped until you get your order", "NTA, I\u2019ve never used Uber eats but this sounds stupid and I agree with you, why tip if the job doesn\u2019t even get finished properly", "NTA, I don't tip the server when I order my food, not tipping till after I get it either. Unless it's jimmy John's .they always get tipped before and extra, bc I order from there often and they never mess my stuff up", "YTA.

And they responded accordingly. Your CHEAP ASS COULDNT TIP FOR MCDONALDS.", "NTA, not your duty to subsidize an industry that doesn't pay well.

All Doordash orders, including the sauces, are packaged by us. The bags have a seal that\u2019s put on the order, in order to keep the food enclosed.

I understand how people can live on tips, so I always tip for even the bare minimum of decent service, it takes something bad to make me not tip.", "With most apps, the driver knows if you tipped on the app or not before they take the job. No tip, and your food will likely sit around until it is bundled into another order that has a tip.", "That's how tips work. You don't know the tip until the end.", "If the bad is sealed so the driver can\u2019t access the food then why did they imply the sauce was missing bc OP didn\u2019t tip? Seems like they were messing with them. Tipping should be done after the service is rendered. Blind tipping doesn\u2019t make much sense to me.", "Does the driver still deserve the tip if they leave the restaurant and take forever to get to my place taking detours and my food is ice cold? Do they still deserve a tip when they deliver to the wrong place?\n\nI think this mindset enables these services to pay shit to their drivers.", "The driver was only rude after OP tried to blame the driver for no dips. Which is absolutely not their fault. He was not rude prior. \n\nThe driver delivered the food and was not going to say anything. OP is an entitled ass who really should just go pick up his own food because he can\u2019t understand that the drivers are not responsible for verifying the food.", "Nope Uber eats shows the driver before they accept the order how much the tip is", "Pretty sure OP opened the bag to check and the driver didn't care enough to make it his problem because OP didn't tip. Seems extremely obvious to me, what do you expect the un-tipped driver to do? Drive back to McDonald's to get sauces for a guy who didn't tip him and waste his time and gas money?? \n\nIf you aren't gonna tip beforehand on a delivery app then don't use the delivery app. Plain and simple.", "Yeah, maybe I misread that. I\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t use delivery apps much bc I know they\u2019re not great for most parties involved but in general it doesn\u2019t make much sense to tip beforehand either way. Tipping is definitely important but the delivery aspect still falls to the driver so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re infallible. They maybe don\u2019t have much to do with the food itself but there\u2019s other things to consider."]}
