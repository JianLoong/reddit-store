We all turned around retching and coughing for fresh air. I didn't know it's possible for anything to smell that bad.\n\nThe zookeeper laughed like it was nothing and said \"Just kidding, I wouldn't do that to you, guess I have to clean this alone. enjoy the rest of your day!\"\n\nI don't think 99.9% of people could do that job, like at *all*.

Son needs to learn to put his money where his mouth is, and that if you fuck around, you may just find out. \n\nAlso, as a conservation/zoo professional, it is NOT just \"scooping poop\" and you almost always need a degree (at least an associates). It's also an incredibly hard field to get into. So no, many don't necessarily have a masters or higher, but many are required to have an associates and often a bachelor's. Zoos are also so much more then just zookeeper! Any job you can think of, you can find it at the zoo!", "NTA\u2026 you deserve the mom of the year award. I\u2019m not a strict parent by any stretch of the word but I had one rule when my kids were younger and that was to be nice (until it\u2019s time not to be). I even had a little saying in my head to make sure I followed through on discipline bc I sucked otherwise which was \u201cI\u2019d rather my kids hate me than people hate them.\u201d It was my reminder to not always do what was easy which would be letting them get away with shit (which I did mostly but not when it came to anything hurtful to another person). Taking the easy way out would be selfish of me and only make them miserable in the end. So I commend you. I know that wasn\u2019t easy to do but it was a big gift you gave him. Way to go!!", "NTA, making sure your child is a moral person is a very important part of a parents job. Since his dad said that, it probably came from him. He's talking to your younger child the way his dad talks to him.", "You need at least a bachelor's degree to work with the animals (and that includes cleaning the enclosures) for most zoos.  In fact, I had a friend that got told her bachelor's wasn't enough and she really needed to get a master's degree for the zoo she really wanted to work at.\n\nUsually those volunteer at the zoo jobs are picking up litter from the trails, taking tickets at the main booth, maybe clearing up the lunch area and any rides.  I doubt he'll be allowed inside an enclosure.  Which is a good thing because if he already hates animals he's not likely to respect them, especially if he's being sulky.\n\nI do think he needs to be taught a lesson, so NTA, but I don't think your attempt to make the punishment fit the crime was the best solution.  Especially if he's already getting these ideas from his dad.\n\nEdit to add:  If you really want him to learn about caring for animals and doing the \"dirty\" jobs, have him volunteer at a humane society.  Then he'll be cleaning litter boxes, rabbit cages, picking up dog poop, learning how to bath and groom an animal, etc.  Those volunteers really do the hands on work.", "NTA.

Hopefully your son will learn his lesson.", "NTA\n\nBUT - very important - most zoos have a few different sorts of these \"volunteer programs.\" \n\n- There's the long-term volunteering you have to commit to for several months and apply for (free)...\n\n- There's the paid \"fun\" little programs where you get little tours and photo ops with the animals and it's more like a tourist thing than anything zookeepers really have to do. Maybe a little cleaning and unpleasantness involved but they go pretty far out of their way to spare you from the worst of it, because they want you coming back and paying more!...\n\n- And there's the more \"vocational\" programs for people more serious about a zookeeping profession, where they definitely won't hold anything back and you'll be getting down and dirty. Sometimes zoos will remember those who perform well in such programs and offer them internships later on (most do **not** perform well...at all...lol).\n\nI'm guessing you did, but make sure it's the 3rd \"down and dirty\" kind!

My only complaint is that often these courses are in demand, and he may be taking the spot of someone who really wants to learn.  But I hope it teaches him some respect, both for zoo keepers, and for manual workers", "Definitely NTA, and I'm sure you are not doing it just because he embarrassed you (in case someone gets a wrong message) and what you did is what I'd call great parenting. Hopefully the volunteer program will actually help your son learn the lessons you want him to learn.", "NTA. This sounds like an excellent solution to a problem that could get out of hand quickly. Hopefully they will explain to him just how hard it is to become a zookeeper, and just for my own selfish satisfaction I hope they teach him aaallll about the ways they use and study poo.", "NTA\n\nYour son may not value zookeepers but they're probably highly qualified and also probably love their job, even if parts of it aren't that glamorous.\n\nYour son needs to learn not to look down on people who are doing an honest days work, whatever that work may be. Communities need all sorts of workers. Not everyone can be a doctor or lawyer, and not everyone wants to be one either. Some people love manual/practical jobs, others don't. Finding a job you enjoy is important too, not just the wages, given how much of our lives we spend working.", "NTA, but you should have gone for the humane society or your local pound. I have volunteered at both zoos and pounds, and at zoos it was simple stuff like trash pick up. At humane societies and pounds I was scrubbing down kennels in ninety degree heat....", "It's not just that it's physically demanding, that's the least of it.\n\nI wonder how \"easy\" he'll think it is when he has to clean up sick gorilla diarrhea that they've painted the enclosure with, mostly-digested rat that a vulture puked up, or gets sprayed by a tiger (happened to me just this morning, I am still quite unsuitable for public interaction \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22)\n\nNTA", "YTA - volunteers who don\u2019t want to be there often just create more work for the employees. Those kind of opportunities are for people who genuinely want to volunteer, not to discipline your children", "NTA, I hope this can widen his narrow mind a little bit!

My family and I went to the Cincinnati zoo a couple of summers ago. It was incredibly hot, like, makeup melting off, clothes stuck to you with sweat, miserable heat. Those employees were not only happy to be there, they were so sweet! They were in much thicker clothing, and they still had the character to be fun and engaging with the visitors. It wasn\u2019t forced, either. They were happy to be there. \n\nYour son could do with a good week or two of cleaning toilets and animal enclosures to learn respect for those folks. He might even learn to love it. Imagine if he came back and said he wanted to go back again? I remember mucking stalls at a horse ranch in sub-zero temperatures, but I still got to be around the horses, so I loved it.", "NTA. His attitude sucks. You're teaching him a valuable lesson by giving him invaluable life experience that he might even end up enjoying in the end. There should be more parents like you!", "NTA seems like an appropriate punishment for the crime. \n\nI'd be looking at where this attitude came from though- might be just typical teenage boys trying to be cool or could be parroting bad influences. \n\nMight also be worth sitting him down and looking at places like France where no garbage collection is happening and the streets are piling up. As well as salaries in different roles. I know a lot of people who never went to university and are earning far more than some of us who did (not that money is always more important than job satisfaction or lifestyle, but it might be a tangible way that he can understand/ relate)", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f Bravo for you.
