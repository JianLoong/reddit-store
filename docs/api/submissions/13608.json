We all turned around retching and coughing for fresh air. I didn't know it's possible for anything to smell that bad.\n\nThe zookeeper laughed like it was nothing and said \"Just kidding, I wouldn't do that to you, guess I have to clean this alone. enjoy the rest of your day!\"\n\nI don't think 99.9% of people could do that job, like at *all*.

Son needs to learn to put his money where his mouth is, and that if you fuck around, you may just find out. \n\nAlso, as a conservation/zoo professional, it is NOT just \"scooping poop\" and you almost always need a degree (at least an associates). It's also an incredibly hard field to get into. So no, many don't necessarily have a masters or higher, but many are required to have an associates and often a bachelor's. Zoos are also so much more then just zookeeper! Any job you can think of, you can find it at the zoo!", "NTA\u2026 you deserve the mom of the year award. I\u2019m not a strict parent by any stretch of the word but I had one rule when my kids were younger and that was to be nice (until it\u2019s time not to be). I even had a little saying in my head to make sure I followed through on discipline bc I sucked otherwise which was \u201cI\u2019d rather my kids hate me than people hate them.\u201d It was my reminder to not always do what was easy which would be letting them get away with shit (which I did mostly but not when it came to anything hurtful to another person). Taking the easy way out would be selfish of me and only make them miserable in the end. So I commend you. I know that wasn\u2019t easy to do but it was a big gift you gave him. Way to go!!", "NTA, making sure your child is a moral person is a very important part of a parents job. Since his dad said that, it probably came from him. He's talking to your younger child the way his dad talks to him.", "You need at least a bachelor's degree to work with the animals (and that includes cleaning the enclosures) for most zoos.  In fact, I had a friend that got told her bachelor's wasn't enough and she really needed to get a master's degree for the zoo she really wanted to work at.\n\nUsually those volunteer at the zoo jobs are picking up litter from the trails, taking tickets at the main booth, maybe clearing up the lunch area and any rides.  I doubt he'll be allowed inside an enclosure.  Which is a good thing because if he already hates animals he's not likely to respect them, especially if he's being sulky.\n\nI do think he needs to be taught a lesson, so NTA, but I don't think your attempt to make the punishment fit the crime was the best solution.  Especially if he's already getting these ideas from his dad.\n\nEdit to add:  If you really want him to learn about caring for animals and doing the \"dirty\" jobs, have him volunteer at a humane society.  Then he'll be cleaning litter boxes, rabbit cages, picking up dog poop, learning how to bath and groom an animal, etc.  Those volunteers really do the hands on work.", "NTA.

Hopefully your son will learn his lesson.", "NTA\n\nBUT - very important - most zoos have a few different sorts of these \"volunteer programs.\" \n\n- There's the long-term volunteering you have to commit to for several months and apply for (free)...\n\n- There's the paid \"fun\" little programs where you get little tours and photo ops with the animals and it's more like a tourist thing than anything zookeepers really have to do. Maybe a little cleaning and unpleasantness involved but they go pretty far out of their way to spare you from the worst of it, because they want you coming back and paying more!...\n\n- And there's the more \"vocational\" programs for people more serious about a zookeeping profession, where they definitely won't hold anything back and you'll be getting down and dirty. Sometimes zoos will remember those who perform well in such programs and offer them internships later on (most do **not** perform well...at all...lol).\n\nI'm guessing you did, but make sure it's the 3rd \"down and dirty\" kind!

My only complaint is that often these courses are in demand, and he may be taking the spot of someone who really wants to learn.  But I hope it teaches him some respect, both for zoo keepers, and for manual workers", "Definitely NTA, and I'm sure you are not doing it just because he embarrassed you (in case someone gets a wrong message) and what you did is what I'd call great parenting. Hopefully the volunteer program will actually help your son learn the lessons you want him to learn.", "NTA. This sounds like an excellent solution to a problem that could get out of hand quickly. Hopefully they will explain to him just how hard it is to become a zookeeper, and just for my own selfish satisfaction I hope they teach him aaallll about the ways they use and study poo.", "NTA\n\nYour son may not value zookeepers but they're probably highly qualified and also probably love their job, even if parts of it aren't that glamorous.\n\nYour son needs to learn not to look down on people who are doing an honest days work, whatever that work may be. Communities need all sorts of workers. Not everyone can be a doctor or lawyer, and not everyone wants to be one either. Some people love manual/practical jobs, others don't. Finding a job you enjoy is important too, not just the wages, given how much of our lives we spend working.", "NTA, but you should have gone for the humane society or your local pound. I have volunteered at both zoos and pounds, and at zoos it was simple stuff like trash pick up. At humane societies and pounds I was scrubbing down kennels in ninety degree heat....", "It's not just that it's physically demanding, that's the least of it.\n\nI wonder how \"easy\" he'll think it is when he has to clean up sick gorilla diarrhea that they've painted the enclosure with, mostly-digested rat that a vulture puked up, or gets sprayed by a tiger (happened to me just this morning, I am still quite unsuitable for public interaction \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22)\n\nNTA", "YTA - volunteers who don\u2019t want to be there often just create more work for the employees. Those kind of opportunities are for people who genuinely want to volunteer, not to discipline your children", "NTA, I hope this can widen his narrow mind a little bit!

My family and I went to the Cincinnati zoo a couple of summers ago. It was incredibly hot, like, makeup melting off, clothes stuck to you with sweat, miserable heat. Those employees were not only happy to be there, they were so sweet! They were in much thicker clothing, and they still had the character to be fun and engaging with the visitors. It wasn\u2019t forced, either. They were happy to be there. \n\nYour son could do with a good week or two of cleaning toilets and animal enclosures to learn respect for those folks. He might even learn to love it. Imagine if he came back and said he wanted to go back again? I remember mucking stalls at a horse ranch in sub-zero temperatures, but I still got to be around the horses, so I loved it.", "NTA. His attitude sucks. You're teaching him a valuable lesson by giving him invaluable life experience that he might even end up enjoying in the end. There should be more parents like you!", "NTA seems like an appropriate punishment for the crime. \n\nI'd be looking at where this attitude came from though- might be just typical teenage boys trying to be cool or could be parroting bad influences. \n\nMight also be worth sitting him down and looking at places like France where no garbage collection is happening and the streets are piling up. As well as salaries in different roles. I know a lot of people who never went to university and are earning far more than some of us who did (not that money is always more important than job satisfaction or lifestyle, but it might be a tangible way that he can understand/ relate)", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f Bravo for you.

That pretty much goes for whatever hobby he might be into, from an outsiders perspective, anything they're not interested could be boring/gross/tiresome.", "NTA", "NTA.", "Lmao it\u2019s funny because most zookeepers have at least a masters degree to be able to specialize in such large/exotic animals. Nobody is just getting hired at a zoo off the street, unless it\u2019s a non accredited zoo. In that case, don\u2019t go or you\u2019re supporting animal abuse.", "\"AITA for foisting my obnoxious kid on some zookeepers rather than parenting him properly myself?\"\n\nYes, 100% YTA", "NTA", "Your kids will probably end up not talking to you, if you don't end up losing custody. No wonder you're divorced", "You should tell your ex that it\u2019s called \u201cparenting.\u201d You knocked this out of the park. A great learning experience for your son.", "Nta best response", "NTA. It sounds like you're doing your part in attempting to make it so your **son** doesn't turn out to be an AH. Sadly though, if he's that far up his fathers a** in thought processes... this might just push him a little bit farther.", "NTA. He'll learn respect.", "NTA. Good parenting, imo. I hope he actually learns a badly needed lesson or 5.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who look down on blue collar workers and think that the jobs require no intellectual capabilities are the worst. I\u2019ve learned a lot from blue collar jobs that I have applied in every day life and I have learned a lot from the ppl I worked with as well. The program will teach him multiple valuable lessons, the most important one being in EMPATHY. Even if what he said was true, it\u2019s still unnecessary to say, and rude.", "I am ngl I think YTA, *not* because it's unfair on your son but because it's unfair on the poor zookeepers! Those zookeeper for a day programs are meant for people who'll really love it and much in, not for petulant teenagers who are being forced to be there and will be a nightmare to handle.", "NTA. You are teaching him a valuable lesson, he will appreciate it one day.", "NTA\n\nThis is like the textbook perfect consequence. Nicely done.", "NTA. That's a fantastic way to handle the problem", "Good parenting!!!!", "Not sure what to vote on this one. I applaud that you want him to change his attitude and are looking for an appropriate way to do so. On the other hand, you are going to be exposing poor innocent animals and zoo keepers to him for a week.", "NTA - however I think it would benefit him if you go with him so the staff aren't dealing with a bratty kid who doesn't want to be there. Maybe make it clear why he's actually there from the beginning? (to the staff) and kind of supervise + still honoring your responsibility", "NTA at all! I think is is definitely one case where the punishment more than fits the crime. And the way I understand it is that zookeepers *are* highly educated individuals with degrees. Good for you! I hope the kid learns something!", "NTA you\u2019re a good parent", "NTA", "NTA - the type of work your son appears to look down on are the ones that keeps society running. Covid should have taught the world that service professions are undervalued. I worked for many years in academia and the number of arrogant professors who were unable to change a lightbulb yet looked down upon those who did it for them was shocking. Both your husband and son need an attitude change.", "NTA - it\u2019s brilliant.", "NTA. I hope it helps him see the people who work, as people. He might end up finding something in common with his zoo keeper/other volunteers and it could open his eyes up a little. \n\nEven if he still hates it after, it provides a lot of learning experience and opportunities. Maybe to continue the experience you could have him explore the salaries of some careers he's interested in or ask him how he wants to use his intellect in the future?\n\nThis opens a wide range of learning. I hope it goes well and he might even make some friends. I hope you give an update on how it goes!", "Fuck, I'm 33 and I would love to do zoo-keeping for a week.\n\nYour son better be getting straight A's with his attitude. I would forever now on call him out when grades are slipping and telling him ''looks like your going to be cleaning toilets with your grades buddy''\n\nAlso I am pretty sure zookeepers need decent degrees and what not but IDK.", "NTA", "NTA.. This is an inspired way to teach your Son a life lesson .", "Very harsh. I hope he doesn't complain and make it horrible for the workers while he is there saying mean things to them. My partner is the \"trash man\" driving the garbage and recyclables truck for our township. A lot of people think his job is menial or lower grade or whatever they want to think but he makes more money than my niece who is a college graduate and other college graduates I know too. And he has a good pension too and keeps his insurance when he retires.", "Its not just harsh. Its mean.", "NTA\n\nHowever, try to frame it as a learning experience (i.e., putting himself in someone else shoes) rather than a punishment.  If he goes into it thinking that it will be horrible and negative, he may not learn what you want him to or anything at all (teenagers are really good at that). Although the volunteering will probably entail some hard work, find out what could be fun/interesting to him and make sure he knows about those aspects.  You will also want to examine what attitudes he's learning from you and your husband as well as from his peers. \n\nIt seems what you're concerned about is your son's attitude toward and treatment of people that he perceives as lower on the social scale than him and his lack of empathy.  Respect for other people whatever the situation can be taught in another environment if his feelings are so negative towards the zoo volunteering that he won't learn anything.  Talk to your son and husband to make they understand the deeper lesson you want to impart.", "NTA. Good for you OP. You\u2019re a good parent, if more people were like you the world would be a better place.", "Remember that the smell will go inside their body and become a part of them. They are going to sweat it...\n\nIf you are a zoo worker, you probably only can date another zoo worker.\n\nIf you are working with otters. Well. Your dating pool is limited to the other otter keepers...", "I agree. Volunteers should be for those who actually want to volunteer, not to punish your child all because they just...said something they shouldn't have. Plus, he's 16. Is this kind of punishment really necessary? He's not a kid anymore. Least you could do is explain to him that he could have at least been more quieter about it. The dad is right. You were harsh, OP.\n\nSorry, but, YTA.", "Not OP, but the kid clearly needs a lesson in humility. So what if he can do the job? The point is having him work there so he learns that just because something is \u201csimple\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy work.", "Yeah, I can already see the son want to go to dad's and stay there and never come back to OP's ever again.", "What? So empty threats are enough? Weak.", "It\u2019s not only the looking down on but the loud public rudeness that is a problem here. Good job OP and NTA, but maybe sign him up for a basic manners course as well.", "Haha. God I love animals and wanted to work with big cats specifically but ive heard all the smell horror stories and i dont think I could take it.", "I work with big cats and even I hate being near otter keepers, something about their perpetual stench really grosses me out.", "Then he'll hopefully see how he was being a dick and eat his words. Win win.", "\"it's okay to think lesser of people who do manual labor jobs as long as you're quiet about it\" \n\nYou're telling on yourself", "I wanted to become a zookeeper and look after penguins until I actually smelt them at Edinburgh Zoo. The combination of fish, that weird salt water smell and the poop was not one I would forget in a hurry.", "I haven't worked in zoos or animal husbandry myself, but I went with my dad once to help set up a new PA system for a show at the local aquarium (he used to be a sound engineer with PA for hire). We went backstage onto the walkways above the tanks, and I'll never forget how hot and humid it was in there or how smelly! I have all the respect for anyone who works there on a daily basis, I could barely handle five minutes before having to step out for some fresh air!", "My kid is looking into being a zookeeper someday, do you have any advice for what college courses she should look into? She already is thinking Zoology, but are there other paths that would let her work at a zoo as well?", "Cleaning shit is something you could make a robot for, but it's just not worth it right now with how little we can pay people who clean shit.", "Reddit is young, very young. I ignore the dumb comments. They will learn one day.", "I agree with that. Lets give some peace to this people. My little sister used to be stupid (I don't know where it was coming from because we're not super wealthy and my parents didn't have \"amazing\" jobs) so mom signed her up for a student job during summer hollidays... in a cleaning industry. She spent 2 months scrubbing toilets.", "Wow, thanks for taking my comment out of context. I never meant it as \"Oh, the kid was justified\" or whatever. I meant to say that there are OTHER WAYS to discipline. Sending him to the zoo will literally f*ck up everyone else's time. Do you really think that's a good compromise? Volunteering should be for those who want to, not people who make rude comments out loud. Maybe read again before commenting.", "The Edinburgh Zoo penguins smell worse than other penguins. I firmly believe this is a fact, even though I suspect science would not back it up.", "Oh dear. Which animals were in the tanks? If it was only dolphins and whales and the like I'm surprised it'd be that smelly!", "I can't speak to zoo keeping but I worked on sheep farms for a bit as a teenager. When animals are penned up in close quarters over winter it fucking *reeks* even if you rotate them and put down fresh straw.\n\nYou can get used to it with exposure but it is rough. Closest I've ever come to throwing up because of a smell.", "Have you tried to keep your house clean with a robot vacuum alone? Sure, it helps, but it's nowhere near what a human can do.", "Every person I know in real life who has this attitude is in their early 30s, too young to be boomers. I\u2019m always flabbergasted by their lack of empathy.", "Not only that but a burden on the animals. I wouldn't put it past a 16 year old to prank or even harm an animal to get kicked out of the program. \n\nI assume that the kid gets an allowance and has devices, so perhaps the punishment is that he has to do something supposedly \"menial\" to earn his allowance and for him to buy back, at full retail price, his devices. He gets paid the prevailing minimum wage.  If it takes two weeks for him to buy his devices, great, if it takes 8 months, so be it.", "Didn\u2019t help I visited in the summer when it was warm.", "It was so long ago that I don't remember too much of it, but definitely no mammals; I think it was saltwater fish, and they had some sharks and rays in there. From what I remember, they'd do a feeding time show where the audience could ask the presenter questions while the in-house divers fed the sharks and rays, and answered the audience questions as best as they could too (with a lot of translating from the presenter)", "Their droppings are like stinky glue, and take a LOT of scrubbing to remove.", "They eat a lot of fish so I expect it's pretty fragrant.", "Interesting. If it was that bad with those be glad it wasn't penguins or marine mammals! Haha", "Why would it be worse from birds and mammals? I thought fish would smell more fishy than mammals, haha.", "Big Cat Scat.", "I was surprised how waxy they feel, yet in hindsight it makes perfect sense!", "Oh, definitely! I love animals, but there's no way I'm cut out to work with them!", "Why would it be worse from birds and mammals? I thought fish would smell more fishy than mammals, haha."]}
