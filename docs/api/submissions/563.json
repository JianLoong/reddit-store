It's won country wide awards and is notorious in my city. People across the city travel to our neighbourhood to come visit it.\n\nOver the past 5 years, it's gotten out of control beyond what the neighbourhood can handle. We're deeply secluded in a suburban neighbourhood and you basically have to drive past about 200 or so houses and 3 tiny roads to get to it. There's only one way in and one way out, and it takes me well over 5 minutes to drive to my own house for what should take 30 seconds. We also don't have enough space on our driveway for me to park, so I have  to park on the street. Then because all the street parking is used, I have to wait around another 5-10 minutes for someone to vacate a spot so I can park my own damn car. These past couple of days it's taken me 20 minutes for what should take 1 minute tops to get to my own house. \n\nNot only traffic, but the neighbourhood gets wild too. Tons of noise, drunk people etc. wandering around (mind you, in a neighbourhood walking distance from an elementary school, so tons of families/kids). Found numerous beer cans on the street just this morning. There was an invite only house party on the street in 2018 and a bunch of haunted house patrons invaded the party, and it ended up with broken windows, alcohol stained carpets and the cops called. \n\nBasically, there's far too many stories to name and Halloween has been absolute hell on our street over the past 5 years. A couple of neighbours and I were going to file a complaint to the city and hope to have the haunted house be moved to an actual location that can handle the traffic and out of our neighbourhood for good. \n\nThe only reason I'm questioning my morals is because the admission is a donation to charity, so it's to a good cause. And obviously, they're not trying to be assholes but frankly, the scale of the attraction has vastly outgrown the neighbourhood and it needs to go.\n\nEdit: I meant to say \"aren't intentionally being assholes\", not \"are intentionally being assholes\" in the comment thing that AITA makes you do.", "created_utc": 1667111142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh6ifz/wibta_for_filing_a_complaint_on_my_neighbours/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I love haunted houses, but I wouldn't want one that has become this big in my neighborhood either, especially since it's becoming a safety concern.", "NTA Let me tell you a quick story. There used to be an off-road dirt bike race in the next town over from where I grew up. Every year it got bigger and rowdier, to the point where the crowds got out of control. Think 500 population town has at least 1,000 folks turn up from out of town. The last year they ran the race, there was a medical emergency just outside of town where many of the racers were camping. The crowd wouldn\u2019t let the ambulance over the bridge that is the only vehicle access, even attacked the ambulance. The town didn\u2019t allow the event back the following year. Venue and infrastructure matter where large groups gather. It doesn\u2019t sound like your neighborhood has the means to accommodate the patrons of this haunted house. You and your other neighbors need to start by talking to the guy who runs the haunted house. Let them know your concerns and inconveniences. Donating to charity is nice, but is it worth making your own neighborhood unsafe? Is it worth pissing off your neighbors that you have to live next to the rest of the year?", "OK, if your house or a house nearby caught fire, would the fire department have issues with getting to your home?  How about an ambulance?  If the answer is yes, then you woukd be a AH for NOT calling about the haunted house... so NTA.", "Maybe try writing the guy a formal request to have it moved next year. Clearly state all the concerns for the neighborhood.  Get your neighbors on board and actually signing it. Try to get at least half the neighbors to sign.\n\nIt may go easier if you can recommend places big enough  who may be willing to donate space for the haunted house.\n\nKeep a fully signed copy for yourself. If this doesn't work, then use the copy as proof you tried to reconcile the issue without involving the township.", "NTA\n\nCan y\u2019all have it so only those with permits can park on the street? I\u2019d definitely call the city with a complaint and require security and police directing traffic", "NTA. This isn't just a nuissance, it's an accident waiting to happen. Your neighbor needs to find a new location for his Haunted House.", "NTA\n\nHomestly that sounds miserable, even for only a few days a year.", "NTA. This is definitely not the right place for a popular haunted house, especially when it's endangering children. Talk to the neighbor privately before filing a complaint, to see if there's any way the problem can be fixed.", "I'd talk to the neighbor first before filing a complaint so that they can plan accordingly for next year NTA", "NTA\u2026just from a safety standpoint this needs the city to step in. Good luck, this sounds highly annoying", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf enough of you report it and complain, your life will get better. Maybe you even can get a restricted zone with resident parking only?", "Have you tried expressing your concerns to the neighbor first and try to work with them on minimizing the issues?  If not, then you'd be the asshole for ruining the fun tradition for one week of inconvenience. Don't be that guy.", "There's other ways to support charities without infringing on a residential area. NTA.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t over some petty reason or just cause you don\u2019t like him these are legitimate and understandable reasons as to why you and most likely many other in the neighborhood want it gone or at least moved. A neighborhood like you described just can\u2019t handle that influx of traffic and even if it can eventually get people through it\u2019s just that people don\u2019t want that in their neighborhood. I get pissed of just getting behind someone unnecessarily slow in my neighborhood I couldn\u2019t imagine waiting in actual traffic and then having to wait to find parking in front of my own damn house", "I would talk to zoning first to see if this is legal?  Do you live in an HOA neighborhood and is this covered by bylaws?  Report all drunk and disorderly behavior to police.  Can you get a copy of the police report from the prior house party invasion in add to your case?  Are other neighbors willing to sign a letter or petition of agreement against the haunted house?", "NTA. I've seen many home based events like this escalate beyond control (usually Halloween or Christmas related), and there is a point where it just has to be shut down for safety and nuisance reasons. It's great that a charity benefits from the event, but if it comes at the cost of annoying the hell out of everyone living nearby then the event has run it's course and needs to relocate or shut down. \n\nIf it's attracting drunks, then it becomes a serious liability issue too. I wonder if their home owner's insurance knows about it.", "NTA - If things are getting out of hand then, yeah, you have every right to complain. Especially of you have evidence and legit concerns for others safety. And bonus points for suggesting an alternative so that they can continue having their haunted house but in a safer environment.", "Just start charging for parking and make $ and tow people out of your space that don't pay.", "I'm going get down voted. But we're all allowed our own opinion.\n\nYour an ass\n\nThe St isn't private any one can park in it.\n\nIts your own fault that you can not park on your drive.\n\nBut the real reason your the ass is it makes money for charity. Because of the cost of living as risine alot ,lots of charity's are not geting as many donations as possible. So the money there rasing will go a long way", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We used to have a house like that here for Christmas. The owner collected food and money for a foodbank and each year thousands of dollars were donated from this. Neighbors complained so he limited it to a couple of weeknights and weekends for the season. They still complained. Now he doesn't do it any longer. The food bank is out those donations, the community lost this really cool attraction (that also made national news each year). He was doing something that made him happy, used his skills, and benefited the community. That's all lost now because neighbors were inconvenienced on occasion for a couple weeks. We went a few times, traffic wasn't that different that people out looking at Christmas lights.", "NTA. Back story. Nothing as bad as you have. I live in a subdivision. It\u2019s basically a 1 mile circle. Tons of people bring their kids here to trick or treat. \nWhen I say tons I mean as on a rainy night it\u2019s over 300 and on a nice night it\u2019s over 400. This year I bought enough for 500 kids. This is all in a 2 hour time period! Probably 6 years ago it became unsafe. Too many small children competing with cars. So we decided to hire the police,turn the road into a one way for the 2 hours and only residents were allowed to drive in. Everyone else needed to park at the local school and walk the extra small distance. Everyone is happy and the kids are safe.\n\nMy point is maybe something like this could work for you. Could they decrease the hours, have everyone park at a certain location? Maybe the local elementary school you mentioned. Maybe have a shuttle to the house? Definitely you should work with the city before some child gets hurt. Use the children safety as your main concern.", "It sounds like a nuisance but it's only for a few days each year.\n\nSpeak to your neighbour like a grown up.  Ask him if something can be done about the parking situation.  YTA if you report it without speaking to him first and trying to resolve the issues.", "NTA. They are ruining your enjoyment of your property. I\u2019m shocked that no permit was required to put this on.", "Nta - this has gone past a casual fun neighbourhood thing. It\u2019s now a hazard and infringing on the safety and privacy of others. I would speak to the homeowner first, I would also speak to your neighbours too, making sure everyone is on the same page. Then if things don\u2019t improve or get worse, then report.", "But my question is would that really be the most efficient way? Ideally, none of us want this here next year as it's becoming too much to deal with \n\nThe haunted house has got city wide notoriety. I feel like if enough people complained, the city government could easily find them a place to re-locate instead of us asking them to find one themselves", "\u2026.. for one day a year? That\u2019s a bit much.", "I think you're the ass. This is a major safety hazard and public nuisance, and there are other ways to raise money.", "Efficient? Being neighbourly isn\u2019t usually efficient, in the sense of \u2018sorted to my satisfaction immediately.\u2019", "It would be the neighborly way. \n\nIt is not the cities job to find them another venue. They will just shut it down. \n\nGoing straight to the top will just get it shut down, unless they already have it permitted. Then the city won't do anything at all until you prove its a safety hazard.", "It runs for Halloween weekend and then all the days leading up to Halloween if it's on a weekday, so based upon when Halloween lands, it can go for 2-3 days, or a whole week\n\nThis year, Halloween is on a Monday so it's only running four thankfully", "The neighborly way would be to host your haunted house in a commercial venue. The neighbor lost his neighbor privileges years ago with his inconsiderate behavior.\n\nNTA OP, make sure you all individually call the cops so they actually show up.", "INFO: have you tried talking to them and see what can be done?\n\nWhen we can, we run our Halloween over the whole weekend, sometimes as a three-day event, and work with our neighbours to ensure no ruffled feathers."]}
