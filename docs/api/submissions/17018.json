I have a group of six friends and their significant others from highschool. All of us are in our mid 20s.

One doesn\u2019t want to host, two live with their parents and can\u2019t, another has roommates that won\u2019t let them, etc. we all live in a rural area so there isn\u2019t really anywhere to go for more than a quick dinner, so someone hosting is the only way we can all hang out really. When I host it\u2019s always later in the day; around 7 pm ish. That\u2019s when most of us are off work. I also have a no children rule for my house, since my dog is afraid of children and I honestly don\u2019t like kids anyways. (My nephew yanked my dogs tail several times so now my dog growls at kids). \n\nI had a gathering last weekend, a dinner time bbq. Everyone was invited; same rules as norm. Jessica asked if she could bring her kids, because she can\u2019t afford a babysitter and since both of their dads aren\u2019t involved at all. I said no, because of my dogs and also because I don\u2019t want her baby and toddler at my house. The last time she brought them she kept trying to push them off on other people who didn\u2019t want to hold them so she could relax. Also her toddler puked on my 5k white couch, which I had to replace. No she didn\u2019t pay for it.\n\nJessica blew up on me in the group chat, and said that I always exclude her. I told her I\u2019m not excluding her, I\u2019m excluding kids. All kids. She\u2019s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she\u2019s welcome to host. She kind of went on about how none of that is possible and now she isn\u2019t talking to anyone. Our group is split, half think it\u2019s my house my rules. One said maybe if she screwed better guys she\u2019d be able to have a babysitter. And two think that I should just let her kids come. To be honest, if it was someone else I would maybe cave.

When a woman becomes a mother, her and her kids become a package deal, because most of time childcare falls primarily on the woman, so without help, a woman can't really go anywhere until her children can be left alone. So having a parent in the friend group when you're so fiercly child free at the moment is difficult to navigate. \n\nAlso, it does take a village a raise children, and if you're unwilling to be her village, I don't think it's a choice you should be shamed for, but then don't pretend to be her friend.", "ESH. You are excluding her and you are not her friend. You need to own that. And own that as an adult, people's children are kind of part of the package and should be invited to most things if you really want to see the parents.

By teaching my dogs gently that not everything warrants a bite? I wasn't ripping their fur out, noe was I punching them \ud83e\udd23 it's called prevention training", "It\u2019s explained in the post but\u2026honestly these people just sound lazy. There\u2019s nowhere else to go and nothing else to do other than go to OP\u2019s house? What is everyone else in town doing?", "No one said they NEEDED to. The point is that we can all CHOOSE to be nice and compassionate people who are capable of granting understanding and grace to others. Jesus Christ", "They are not her friends if they are not willing to accommodate and if her having kid is showstopper.\n\nThey are acquitances she is stuck with. But they are not her friends and never were friends, just someone who pretends to be one when it suits him.", "Jesus Christ it\u2019s a suggestion and a reasonable option that most people offer anyways. Both of you have valid points however it is so odd of you guys to be this defensive of normal things", "Well, we don\u2019t know what the fabric may have been or if it was a teeny little 2-seater or a mult-piece sectional. And it\u2019s not as if anybody is here to judge OP\u2019s couch choices. Op says you can\u2019t clean the couch so I take it as face value.", "The friend could still try to figure out how to host I'd she really wanted to. Either that or quit whining that her ill behaved kids aren't allowed.", "Yeah, it\u2019s way easier to teach a dog to put up with abuse then to teach kids how to behave around animals.  After all, if the dog fails the test you can just kill it, right?", "It cannot be understated how badly ESH.", "I think the single mom will find herself friendless based on the ops comments. No one wants to be taken advantage of and forced to watch a kid that isn\u2019t theirs while their mom parties. She chose to have her kids/keep her kids so if that means she has to stay home with them then that\u2019s just how it is. Kids/toddlers don\u2019t belong at parties with people in their 20s who are drinking and having a good time; that\u2019s just bad parenting to even consider bringing them", "It sounds more like they\u2019ve been stuck with her\u2026.", "Someone who trained their dog well.", "Not all dogs are allowed on the furniture", "exactly my thought. went into different scenarios, dog wearing pajamas, crate training, most obedient dog of the year prize\u2026 we clean our paws before we enter the house! rules", "I didn\u2019t say I had a white couch I said I had a dog puke on a rug. And I imagine if I couldn\u2019t get it out of the rug no matter what I did, a white couch would be impossible. Only crazy people own white couches and also have a dog.", "Ill behaved? One is literally a baby, the other a toddler.  There is no such thing as behaved or Ill behaved at that age.", "Also, I want to say 1 thing, if this was male OP running q mother and kids through the dirt.. yall would've already grabbed pitchforks and torches to storm the gates.", "To your comment about asking for it I mean. Because by your logic anyone with kids that\u2019s poor shouldn\u2019t be invited anywhere unless the owner of property is prepared to eat the cost of damages by the child. And if they\u2019re not then they should just never invite over the friend? (even tho it\u2019s very reasonable to expect for restitution no matter who damages your property)\n\nOn your solution: OP sent a message to their larger friend group inviting any of them that the plans worked for over. If the plans don\u2019t work for Jessica then she\u2019s free to make her own or not come. You don\u2019t need to cut people off just because they\u2019re not your best friend or can\u2019t accommodate them. Life isn\u2019t that simple. The invitation is there for the taking if Jessica wants it & no one is forcing her to go or not go. Come or not. Also it\u2019s not 2 faced and I don\u2019t see how OP is being that. You don\u2019t have to get on with everyone in a large friend circle but it\u2019s still courteous to extend the invitation when your hosting (and tbh Jessica should feel lucky she\u2019s invited over again at all after the couch fiasco)", "No, but the parent should have asked to sit anywhere else where there wasn't an expensive couch... The mother and children could have sat on a chair. The mother can also use her brains to prevent things like this.", "My kid knows how to behave around dogs and my dogs know not to be afraid of babies because unlike popular beliefs, baby's grab at stuff without realising what they do. Toddlers should know better and should be the ones taking responsibility of their actions.", "She can become friends with other single moms then. Agree with your other points.", "And with dogs, while no supervising her kids!", "Real friends are usually happy to hold their friends baby for half an hour.\n\n>that\u2019s just bad parenting to even consider bringing them\n\nIt's a BBQ, not a rave.", "Obviously you've never owned a dog \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe best trained dog will still shed hair, and puke if they're sick. Training a dog to not jump on the couch isn't a magic solution to stopping either of these things from getting on the couch \ud83d\ude44", "But not well enough to not growl at kids \n\nMy well trained dog had unfortunately had his tail and ears pulled by kids previously. He\u2019s still well trained and doesn\u2019t growl at anyone.", "Ok so if the dog sneezes too hard too close to the couch and snot goes flying on it\u2026. Is that part of training?", "I was agreeing with you and referring to OP about the couch lol", "Sure there is. Toddlers can be told no. They can be taught to mind. Instead she just pushes them off onto other people instead of being a parent. \n\nOf course she isn't going to be welcomed with her kids in that situation. She can host, or she can shut up.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the toddlers responsibility to be aware of their actions, it\u2019s their parent\u2019s responsibility.  I think no matter how well behaved the dog, children can be unpredictable.  They\u2019re small and move unpredictably and make dogs nervous.  It only takes a second for something horrible to happen.\n\nAnd most dogs don\u2019t automatically resort to biting.  They try to get away or they growl.  If a child is climbing on the dog like furniture or yanking it\u2019s ears or tail, the child shouldn\u2019t be interacting with the dog until they can understand how to treat the dog.  They usually only bite when they\u2019re cornered or they\u2019ve been taught not to growl.\n\nBut it\u2019s just not worth the risk, because say the dog has a small injury on the ear or tail that\u2019s being yanked on?  No matter how well behaved the dog is it might snap at the child.  A split second response that it\u2019s not even in control of, and something horrible could happen to the child.  Not worth it.  All interactions should be very closely supervised until the child is old enough to learn how to understand what the dog is \u201csaying\u201d and when to give it space.", "I am not comfortable holding my SISTER'S kids for five minutes. I would not hold my friend's kids for anything less than an emergency.", "I\u2019m not comfortable holding any child for a half hour, except in emergencies.", "My dude. No one wants to hold your literal baby for 30 minutes. If that friend likes babies/ your baby then maybe!!! \n\nDon\u2019t just assume that about people. They also do not care about seeing pictures of your baby doing activities. They are pretending because they are your friend.", "The op said in one of their comments that as soon as the mother arrives at these get togethers she hands off her kids so she can drink or do whatever. That\u2019s irresponsible and makes it sound like she\u2019s there to take advantage. Maybe if she asked instead of just expecting people to watch her kids it would be different", "Of course it is not the solution, but you can train dogs to not go to specific rooms for example. Like a lot of people train their dogs to not go into the kitchen.   \nYou need to train your dog according to your needs. If you want a white couch and a dog you should probably teach your dog to really stay away from the couch.", "I own a dog and a white couch. Our dog is trained not to go onto the couch or go near couch; she doesn\u2019t shed either. This is not some far fetched scenario.", "That\u2019s a risk someone can choose to take, or not. Risk/reward of owning a dog doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to risk/reward for having unwanted kids in your house.", "u train them not to shed", "I have to be honest, i think the growling is tolerable. At least it is better than if he would just start biting.\n\nOften situations where dogs bit someone \"out of nowhere\" happened because the warning signals the dog sent where either ignored or worst case he even got punished for it. So the dog learns that warning does not help him so he goes straight to attack.\n\nI am not saying that you dont have to train the dog further by showing him that these interacions with kids can be nice and rewarding, but as a start you have to accept that the dog does not like it an shows this, and work from there.", "That's why you never leave a child unsupervised. My son was/is never alone with none of our dogs, big or small. But it was my responsibility to make sure my dogs also knew that no harm would be done to them. And I did this by gently tugging at their tail while sleeping so they learned that this wasn't meant to harm them. Same at their ears etc..\n\nI never hurt them and they never even growled at any child. Even now, I only allow children to pet my dogs when they ask and still I watch with a hawks eye. I had a boxer, husky and Labrador"]}
