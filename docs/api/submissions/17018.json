I have a group of six friends and their significant others from highschool. All of us are in our mid 20s.

One doesn\u2019t want to host, two live with their parents and can\u2019t, another has roommates that won\u2019t let them, etc. we all live in a rural area so there isn\u2019t really anywhere to go for more than a quick dinner, so someone hosting is the only way we can all hang out really. When I host it\u2019s always later in the day; around 7 pm ish. That\u2019s when most of us are off work. I also have a no children rule for my house, since my dog is afraid of children and I honestly don\u2019t like kids anyways. (My nephew yanked my dogs tail several times so now my dog growls at kids). \n\nI had a gathering last weekend, a dinner time bbq. Everyone was invited; same rules as norm. Jessica asked if she could bring her kids, because she can\u2019t afford a babysitter and since both of their dads aren\u2019t involved at all. I said no, because of my dogs and also because I don\u2019t want her baby and toddler at my house. The last time she brought them she kept trying to push them off on other people who didn\u2019t want to hold them so she could relax. Also her toddler puked on my 5k white couch, which I had to replace. No she didn\u2019t pay for it.\n\nJessica blew up on me in the group chat, and said that I always exclude her. I told her I\u2019m not excluding her, I\u2019m excluding kids. All kids. She\u2019s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she\u2019s welcome to host. She kind of went on about how none of that is possible and now she isn\u2019t talking to anyone. Our group is split, half think it\u2019s my house my rules. One said maybe if she screwed better guys she\u2019d be able to have a babysitter. And two think that I should just let her kids come. To be honest, if it was someone else I would maybe cave.

When a woman becomes a mother, her and her kids become a package deal, because most of time childcare falls primarily on the woman, so without help, a woman can't really go anywhere until her children can be left alone. So having a parent in the friend group when you're so fiercly child free at the moment is difficult to navigate. \n\nAlso, it does take a village a raise children, and if you're unwilling to be her village, I don't think it's a choice you should be shamed for, but then don't pretend to be her friend.", "ESH. You are excluding her and you are not her friend. You need to own that. And own that as an adult, people's children are kind of part of the package and should be invited to most things if you really want to see the parents.

OP is YTA and Jessica needs to get good friends not shitty ones who expect a single mother to be perfect and have the money to pay for a new lounge. I find it hard to believe it couldn't be cleaned.

I'm not saying you can't still be friends or that the friendship won't last, but it's unlikely that the friendship will last.\n\nUnfortunately since you're the one who hosts most of the time the most likely outcome here is that Jessica is going to be excluded. You can likely take steps to try to prevent this, but this kind of thing is going to keep happening.\n\nThe truth is, everyone needs to take care of themselves and it DOES sound like Jessica made some poor choices in sexual partners (2 baby daddies and neither is involved with his own kid, sounds like winners). \n\nSadly, we make friends in Highschool and sometimes we change as we age into adulthood.

I\u2019d never step foot in that house again for fear of damaging something that\u2019s supposed to be used, like a couch, could be worth thousands so I actually don\u2019t understand why Jessica *wants* to be there unless this is their only hang out time. None of them are even close to OP\u2019s money bracket clearly given no one else can host. Pulling 5 grand out of no where is something a large majority could *not* do. OP also holds a cheating incident Jessica did in high school against her and admits to not being her friend so that explains their treatment of her. \n\nHowever, Jessica sounds like a hot mess who pawns her kids off apparently which is of course only mentioned in the comments after the fact so I struggle a bit with thinking she\u2019s too terrible if she\u2019s wanted by at least half of the others that simply have no hosting spot available yet. OP clearly has a distaste for her, so I wonder what the spilt half in favor of Jessica would have to say about her. Then again, the half for her just may be very sympathetic so her entitlement doesn\u2019t bother them. Either way, all these people sound like a gossipy judgey drama group that would be no fun to be around. OP has nice house and an aggressive dog so I understand their stance, but they\u2019re also clearly excluding only one person using the children as the excuse- They know she struggles as a single parent, and the kid issue is OP\u2019s get outta jail free card. \u201cShe\u2019s not my friend, I\u2019ve thought little of her since high school, and I can\u2019t stand her, but it\u2019s totally only the kids who can\u2019t come.\u201d They know she doesn\u2019t have many people or much money in her corner. If OP\u2019s house is their main hang out spot the majority of the time, that really sucks for Jessica. I\u2019d just bail and take the closest of us.

This happens even though they know you\u2019re only asking because you care only so much as you\u2019re friends and you care about your friend and how they\u2019re doing but don\u2019t care about parenthood and you know they know that. They also can\u2019t stop from talking about it because that\u2019s their world now, being a parent, and even though they know you genuinely don\u2019t care about Stephen\u2019s potty training or Maddy\u2019s first solid foods (even though you sorta do because, again, they\u2019re your friend and you want to be supportive), they feel compelled to tell you about it. The whole conversation dynamic is different when someone has a kid.", ">People like Jessica : sorry you had kids but they're your job. Childree adults also don't have houses made to accomodate kids and don't want their stuff touched and ruined.\n\nThis!\n\nIn the same way child free people shouldn't ask a host to \"put their kids away\" because they don't like kids or something.

You could get a cover, or replace just the fabric. It was a *decision* to replace the entire couch for that cost, not a necessity to return it to useable/aesthetic quality. I don't know many people that would pay that, in the friends condition. You pay to fix the damage, not pay for their upgrade.", "Because other people wouldn't just dump their kids in the arms of others once they arrive, while Jessica doesn't look after them at all, leading to problems.", "This is why the Foreign Office doesn't serve red wine at its functions - all that white marble in the Durbar Court.", ">hang out really. When I host it\u2019s always later in the day; around 7 pm ish. That\u2019s when most of us are off work. I also have a no children rule for my house, since my dog is afraid of children and I honestly don\u2019t like kids anyways. (My nephew yanked my dogs tail several times so now my dog growls at kids).  \n>  \n>I had a gathering last weekend, a dinner time bbq. Everyone was invited; same rules as norm. Jessica asked if she could bring her kids, because she can\u2019t afford a babysitter and since both of their dads aren\u2019t involved at all. I said no, because of my dogs and also because I don\u2019t want her baby and toddler at my house. The last time she brought them she kept trying to push them off on other people who didn\u2019t want to hold them so she could relax. Also her toddler puked on my 5k white couch, which I had to replace. No she didn\u2019t pay for it.  \n>  \n>Jessica blew up on me in the group chat, and said that I always exclude her. I told her I\u2019m not excluding her, I\u2019m excluding kids. All kids. She\u2019s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she\u2019s welcome to host. She kind of went on about how none of that is possible and now she isn\u2019t talking to anyone. Our group is split, half think it\u2019s my house my rules. One said maybe if she screwed better guys she\u2019d be able to have a babysitter. And two think that I should just let her kids come. To be honest, if it was someone else I would maybe cave. But I don\u2019t like Jessica that much, especially since she didn\u2019t pay for my replacement couch.  \n>  \n>AITA for making child not friendly plans that someone in my friend group can\u2019t make it to?\n\nThese are two people who now find themselves at different stages in life. It's time Jessica realized that none of you are her peers anymore, and move on. Not criticizing any of you, but what can you even talk about anymore? Parenthood creates a gulf in experience between you and the people you know. I don't think that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but sometimes we drift from people because we no longer know how  to relate. Jessica can't relate to your life as an adult with no kids, and you have no reference point to relate to her. I think that not offering to pay for the couch is an AH move, and pawning the kids off on your friends is as well, but if she were to hang out with people who also have kids it those activities would be more child friendly. I wish nothing but the best for all of you, Jessica included. But it's time to let that friendship drift apart.", "I dont think this is universal.

If they didn\u2019t want to keep the kids they don\u2019t have to parent the children but they do have a legal obligation to pay child support, and if they\u2019re not Jessica should absolutely take them to court. Jessica chose two separate times with two separate men to have and keep the kids, not abort or put them up for adoption. Now it\u2019s her responsibility to raise them. I do sympathize with her, she\u2019s clearly lacking a lot of support and dealing with the dead-beat dads is difficult, I\u2019m sure, but if OP and her friend group don\u2019t want to extend that support they are not obligated to.", "Unfortunately in this case, nowhere even close to the picture.", "Mid-twenties in a rural area with multiple dogs and owns a 5k white couch - something doesn't quite add up...", "Not having kids allows one to own furniture items of a color that would be easily stained and ruined forever if they had kids.", "Worked for a woman with white furniture she had one  (non-white) chair her elderly (and wealthy) husband was allowed to sit on.  I was occasionally allowed to sit in his chair if he was in bed.   When he needed more care and agency staff came in,  they were only allowed to sit on the wooden dining room chairs.  This is a small sample. But I think if she'd thought of it, she might have wanted a coat made of puppies.", "especially when they own pets, even without kids. though i\u2019m assuming since the couch seems important to her they keep the dog cordoned off when they\u2019re not home", "I feel like there is a difference between my dog ruining something, or me ruining something, rather than someone's kid ruining it.", "My dogs do not go on certain furniture.", "My mom had two dogs and a white sofa, dogs were trained to never go in the living room.", "Or why children for some people are.

It doesn't make anyone an asshole.

He didn\u2019t even climb on it when we weren\u2019t home. We didn\u2019t mind if he wanted to lay on the couch but his previous owners must have been ultra strict because no amount of convincing would get him to put even a paw on the couch. The couches still had dog hair in them even with a weekly vacuum. He was the only dog we ever owned. That\u2019s just the nature of pet fur really, it gets everywhere. Luckily we had $300 brown couches that hid that well. \n\nHowever, I will say that baby vomit is no joke. We had to replace our carpet after having kids because baby puke stinks no matter how well we cleaned. It\u2019s rotten milk, so super gross.
