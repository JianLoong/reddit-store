I have a group of six friends and their significant others from highschool. All of us are in our mid 20s. The only person in our friend group is Jessica, who has two young children and is a single mom. \n\nI\u2019m the only person in my friend group that can host, as my husband and I own a decent sized house and don\u2019t have anything stopping us from hosting I guess. One doesn\u2019t want to host, two live with their parents and can\u2019t, another has roommates that won\u2019t let them, etc. we all live in a rural area so there isn\u2019t really anywhere to go for more than a quick dinner, so someone hosting is the only way we can all hang out really. When I host it\u2019s always later in the day; around 7 pm ish. That\u2019s when most of us are off work. I also have a no children rule for my house, since my dog is afraid of children and I honestly don\u2019t like kids anyways. (My nephew yanked my dogs tail several times so now my dog growls at kids). \n\nI had a gathering last weekend, a dinner time bbq. Everyone was invited; same rules as norm. Jessica asked if she could bring her kids, because she can\u2019t afford a babysitter and since both of their dads aren\u2019t involved at all. I said no, because of my dogs and also because I don\u2019t want her baby and toddler at my house. The last time she brought them she kept trying to push them off on other people who didn\u2019t want to hold them so she could relax. Also her toddler puked on my 5k white couch, which I had to replace. No she didn\u2019t pay for it.\n\nJessica blew up on me in the group chat, and said that I always exclude her. I told her I\u2019m not excluding her, I\u2019m excluding kids. All kids. She\u2019s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she\u2019s welcome to host. She kind of went on about how none of that is possible and now she isn\u2019t talking to anyone. Our group is split, half think it\u2019s my house my rules. One said maybe if she screwed better guys she\u2019d be able to have a babysitter. And two think that I should just let her kids come. To be honest, if it was someone else I would maybe cave. But I don\u2019t like Jessica that much, especially since she didn\u2019t pay for my replacement couch. \n\nAITA for making child not friendly plans that someone in my friend group can\u2019t make it to?\n\nEdit: I got the couch professionally cleaned and they couldn\u2019t get the very large stain out \n\nUpdate: after reading all of your comments I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m tired of dealing with Jessica. I\u2019m going to tell her she\u2019s no longer welcome at my home and ask her to pay for my couch. If she doesn\u2019t then we can go to court about it.\n\nAnother edit: you guys are really mad I like nice white couches. But I\u2019ll give further info. \n\n1. I considered having the couch reupholstered but the cost to have it shipped out, fixed, and shipped back cost over 5k so it was cheaper and easier to buy a new one. \n2. Yes I have a white couch and a dog. My dog knows not to go near the couch. I\u2019ve had the couch for two years without incident, it was fine till jessicas kids showed up. \n3. I didn\u2019t invite Jessica and her kids. I said no kids are allowed, and she showed up with her kids while I was in the bathroom and set her kids down on the couch.

When a woman becomes a mother, her and her kids become a package deal, because most of time childcare falls primarily on the woman, so without help, a woman can't really go anywhere until her children can be left alone. So having a parent in the friend group when you're so fiercly child free at the moment is difficult to navigate. \n\nAlso, it does take a village a raise children, and if you're unwilling to be her village, I don't think it's a choice you should be shamed for, but then don't pretend to be her friend.", "ESH. You are excluding her and you are not her friend. You need to own that. And own that as an adult, people's children are kind of part of the package and should be invited to most things if you really want to see the parents.

Now she whines that not everyone caters to her and her children. It is entirely her fault she is not welcome anymore.

It's your house and that's fine. Your house your rules. That isn't why you're an asshole.\n\nYou're an asshole because you're still pretending that you and this person are friends when you and several others of your friend group apparently don't even like her. \"If she screwed better guys she'd have a babysitter\" is such a narcissistic mentality to have.

You're of an age where highschool friends tend to fall away as people settle into different kinds of lives.\n\nSounds to me like Jessica is a broke single mom, but you can afford a home and a $5,000 couch. Your paths are diverging and that's the core of this conflict.  I'm not saying you can't still be friends or that the friendship won't last, but it's unlikely that the friendship will last.\n\nUnfortunately since you're the one who hosts most of the time the most likely outcome here is that Jessica is going to be excluded. You can likely take steps to try to prevent this, but this kind of thing is going to keep happening.\n\nThe truth is, everyone needs to take care of themselves and it DOES sound like Jessica made some poor choices in sexual partners (2 baby daddies and neither is involved with his own kid, sounds like winners). \n\nSadly, we make friends in Highschool and sometimes we change as we age into adulthood.

If your friend can't come this time because the no kids rule, maybe next time.  This is blown out of proportion.

Having kids was her choice,  everyone's lifestyle isn't going to change all the time to accommodate her.", "Honestly I\u2019m leaning towards both are assholes.

They seem like the rich person in the friend group that has no concept of money. 5k for a fucking couch?! Are you goddamn high? That\u2019s what I make in a month, and you expect a mother of 2 to pay for that? What does the baby spit fucking acid? There\u2019s no goddamn way that couch needed to be completely replaced.

Why anyone is blaming OP for spending 5k on a white couch is beyond me. It\u2019s her money and she has every right to spend however much she wants, even if she can afford to replace it.

Everybody does and anybody who acts like they don't is on some wild denial nonsense.", "Yeah I was confused with the couch thing too. Some people like to castastrophise things to play victim.

Looks like the friend group will definitely be splitting up now. \n\nMe either! This friend group needs to split up. Honestly, I would have shit myself if someone let me know a couch that is being used by us all that accidentally got damaged by my child getting sick was $5,000 to replace, and I\u2019m a 30 year old homeowner myself. I\u2019d probably throw up with the toddler too once I heard the price lol that\u2019s the price of a used vehicle! I\u2019d never step foot in that house again for fear of damaging something that\u2019s supposed to be used, like a couch, could be worth thousands so I actually don\u2019t understand why Jessica *wants* to be there unless this is their only hang out time. None of them are even close to OP\u2019s money bracket clearly given no one else can host. Pulling 5 grand out of no where is something a large majority could *not* do. OP also holds a cheating incident Jessica did in high school against her and admits to not being her friend so that explains their treatment of her. \n\nHowever, Jessica sounds like a hot mess who pawns her kids off apparently which is of course only mentioned in the comments after the fact so I struggle a bit with thinking she\u2019s too terrible if she\u2019s wanted by at least half of the others that simply have no hosting spot available yet. OP clearly has a distaste for her, so I wonder what the spilt half in favor of Jessica would have to say about her. Then again, the half for her just may be very sympathetic so her entitlement doesn\u2019t bother them. Either way, all these people sound like a gossipy judgey drama group that would be no fun to be around. OP has nice house and an aggressive dog so I understand their stance, but they\u2019re also clearly excluding only one person using the children as the excuse- They know she struggles as a single parent, and the kid issue is OP\u2019s get outta jail free card. \u201cShe\u2019s not my friend, I\u2019ve thought little of her since high school, and I can\u2019t stand her, but it\u2019s totally only the kids who can\u2019t come.\u201d They know she doesn\u2019t have many people or much money in her corner. If OP\u2019s house is their main hang out spot the majority of the time, that really sucks for Jessica. I\u2019d just bail and take the closest of us.

She can\u2019t afford to pay for your couch. You know that. You can win in court, then guess what? You still won\u2019t get the money. I won a judgement against my landlord in court. He could afford to pay, and still hasn\u2019t, 11 years later. Going to court is gonna cost you both time and money for a lawyer, and nobody will win in the long run. Also, you failed to keep people off the couch, which is meant for sitting. The judge might be a fan of babies and rule against you. You invited her over knowing your dog could attack her kids? What would a judge say to that? I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you kept the dog from the kids, but court will get ugly. Friends will testify against friends.

Jessica sounds exhausted and I get it, but it's not cool to pawn your kids off on other people just because they're there. She should have offered to pay, at least to have the couch cleaned. Not sure how you expected her to pay for a new couch though seeing as you obviously know she doesn't have the money and a kid puking isn't anything anyone can control. You also state how, if it were anyone else, you'd cave and let them bring the kids which then makes me question your excuse of saying the dog is afraid of kids. If your dog is now afraid of children, why would you cave for some and not others?

The harsh reality for her is she made a choice to have children with men who were clearly not good potential fathers. She now has consequences of those choices. It's not always fun when we have consequences.\n\nAs for the couch, I think expecting her to pay and going to court if she fails to pay up is pushing it. You can ask for payment but you admit she cannot afford that. You know that if she cannot even afford a sitter for a few hours.  My choice there would be to cool the friendship and not push the issue of getting the money because, even if you get a judgement, you are unlikely to see a dime. The judgement does nothing to force payment. You will have to jump through many hoops to get her wages garnished and even then they may not allow it because she has nothing.  You will pay court costs and won't get anything back so I say cut your losses on that.\n\nJessica is the AH for bring her children when she knew your home was child free. That's on her.

OP also thinks she's better than Jessica as based on her comments.
