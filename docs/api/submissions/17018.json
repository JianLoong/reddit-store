I have a group of six friends and their significant others from highschool. All of us are in our mid 20s.

One doesn\u2019t want to host, two live with their parents and can\u2019t, another has roommates that won\u2019t let them, etc. we all live in a rural area so there isn\u2019t really anywhere to go for more than a quick dinner, so someone hosting is the only way we can all hang out really. When I host it\u2019s always later in the day; around 7 pm ish. That\u2019s when most of us are off work. I also have a no children rule for my house, since my dog is afraid of children and I honestly don\u2019t like kids anyways. (My nephew yanked my dogs tail several times so now my dog growls at kids). \n\nI had a gathering last weekend, a dinner time bbq. Everyone was invited; same rules as norm. Jessica asked if she could bring her kids, because she can\u2019t afford a babysitter and since both of their dads aren\u2019t involved at all. I said no, because of my dogs and also because I don\u2019t want her baby and toddler at my house. The last time she brought them she kept trying to push them off on other people who didn\u2019t want to hold them so she could relax. Also her toddler puked on my 5k white couch, which I had to replace. No she didn\u2019t pay for it.\n\nJessica blew up on me in the group chat, and said that I always exclude her. I told her I\u2019m not excluding her, I\u2019m excluding kids. All kids. She\u2019s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she\u2019s welcome to host. She kind of went on about how none of that is possible and now she isn\u2019t talking to anyone. Our group is split, half think it\u2019s my house my rules. One said maybe if she screwed better guys she\u2019d be able to have a babysitter. And two think that I should just let her kids come. To be honest, if it was someone else I would maybe cave.

Your insistance on bringing up the $5000 price tag of the couch shows it all.\n\nAnd while it does suck that she didn't pay, also hypothetically speaking if Jessica could not afford a babysitter for a night, then what made you think she'd be able to pay for damages on a couch that expensive?\n\nTo get to the crux of the matter though for why YTA, see below:\n\n>**I told her I\u2019m not excluding her**, I\u2019m excluding kids. All kids. She\u2019s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she\u2019s welcome to host.

Those are not viable options for her. While you already, technically, in the clear for establishing your boundaries, you are not in the clear for lying.

When a woman becomes a mother, her and her kids become a package deal, because most of time childcare falls primarily on the woman, so without help, a woman can't really go anywhere until her children can be left alone. So having a parent in the friend group when you're so fiercly child free at the moment is difficult to navigate. \n\nAlso, it does take a village a raise children, and if you're unwilling to be her village, I don't think it's a choice you should be shamed for, but then don't pretend to be her friend.", "ESH. You are excluding her and you are not her friend. You need to own that. And own that as an adult, people's children are kind of part of the package and should be invited to most things if you really want to see the parents. But you don't have to be friends with her and I understand why you might not want to be if she is passing off her kids and letting them ruin your property. It's unfortunate for Jessica now because in a rural area, it's probably hard for her to make new (better) friends. But I'm going to go ahead and guess in about 10 years, the tables might turn.", "NTA. She can find a babysitter or host an event herself. That\u2019s how it works once you have kids.", "YTA. And Jessica is right. You *are* excluding her on purpose. \n\nJessica needs better \"friends.\" You are not her friend.", "Frankly, it is your house, your rules, but you and your other friends could certainly offer to help with the cost of a sitter unless you are all really just passive aggresively trying to oust her from the group.

It's obvious OP is deliberately sticking to this rule specifically to exclude Jessica from these get togethers because she doesn't like her, not just because of her kids.

Also, who spends 5k on a white lounge and doesn't have it protected by getting it scotch guarded or the like, and also who buys a lounge that colour where it's unable to be cleaned and has to be completely replaced?? OP is YTA and Jessica needs to get good friends not shitty ones who expect a single mother to be perfect and have the money to pay for a new lounge. I find it hard to believe it couldn't be cleaned.
