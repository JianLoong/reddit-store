When I met my hub 11 years ago, he started working with me and my parents delivering newspapers. Shortly after that, we became Distributors, which is just a fancy word for super carriers who hired other carriers and covered huge areas of delivery North of Philly.\n\nI spent 24hrs a day with this man and did everything I could to get away from him, but it's not easy when you live with a controlling narcissist. My children and I lived in hell until they day he dropped dead after we got home from work. Turns out, since he didn't take very good care of himself, his cancer came back, a mass developed that compressed his heart and he had a mass heart attack.\n\nI worked 10 hr a day every day for 4 months after they at our business, my kids with me until I dropped them off and went back to work. After a manager stole money out of my check for not giving one of my carriers one of my cars to use, I informed them they broke I contract and left.\n\nI continued to deliver just my original route until they told us, two years ago next week, they gave our contract to my old warehouse and we were all getting laid off the following month. It'll be 2 years since I haven't worked and I use the money the kids get to pay the bills, or keep my kids happy. My bf covers whatever I can't and I take care of him while he's at work and the kids are at school. They hold it against my taxes anyway. I also have whole life policies for all the girls, as the term policy I had on my husband saved my life when he passed, and they can take money out of it later when they're older.\n\nMy mil, who sees the kids on weekends where they can be bothered, loves telling them how selfish I am and how they deserve the money. She's retired and living off her father's inheritance that my kids won't see cause she hates me.\n\nAfter doing the math of how much I'd have to make to cover everything, I'd never see my kids cause I'd be working all the time. Props to the parents that do that, but I want to stay home with my kids and take care of everything here now that I can.\n\nAlso, I leave it to my kids to decide if they want to go to mil's house. I hate it but, it's a break from the kids in our tiny house and I'm not the type to not let them see their family unless I think they're in danger.

Your duty is to protect your kids, if it means you can have no breaks, then you get no breaks!\n\nLay down firm boundaries and if your MIL cannot stop this behaviour, she should not see the children unsupervised.

Even if your ex had been a saint, the whole point of that death benefit is to make sure you and the kids are okay. Kids need a lot more than money to become happy, well-adjusted adults. You're making sure they get it. Unless you're asking her to borrow cash, MIL needs to shut it. \n\nNote- when kiddos get older, you may want to look into classes/certifications/whatever to earn income when they've grown and started their own lives.", "NTA if you are using it as a responsible proxy.

You are letting them make the decision based on how much she spoils them.  But she is also grooming them to believe you are are a selfish bad person.  Why would you let your kids continue to see her regularly when MIL is trying to sabotage your relationship with the kids??\n\nYou need to start doing fun things it\u2019s your kids on the weekends, go to the park or the zoo. They want to go to MILs as opposed to staying I. Their tiny home.  There are more options than MILs house or your house.  There is getting out and doing things with the kids, getting the, involved in regular activities like soccer or dance or whatever.", "NTA at all but the mother in law sure is. Doing what you gotta do to be present for your kids is what makes you a good mom.", "NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s what survivor benefits are for- the kids\u2019 care.

If you reach a point where the family needs or want more money, you can always go back to work.", "YTA. You are a single parent of  three school aged children, get a job.

My aunt\u2019s husband passed a few years ago and she was left struggling to get a job because she had left the workforce over 10 years before (he wanted to provide, so she let him be the provider and they were happy). It really set her back\u2014her self-esteem took a hard hit and it was hard seeing such a confident woman grasping to make ends meet. \n\nI don\u2019t want anyone to struggle like that. Could you maybe try some online/remote work or working part-time as a barista or something just so you have something for Social Security/extra cash for emergency expenses?", "NTA - inheritance goes down the chain - first to wife and then to surviving dependants. MIL sounds like a narcissist herself. I suspect her dads inheritance money is running out and now she wants yours. She wants you to work so she does not have to.\n\nDon't be pressured. The money is yours to spend as you please. You could buy an industrial unit filled with cotton candy and thats your choice. Its not wise, but its your choice to do that if you want. What you did do was put some away for your kids futures (which is amazing). You sound like you are doing everything right and being a responsible mother. \n\nwhat is more concerning is the MIL is effectively trying to alienate the children against you. \n\nYou need to consider that your children \\* are \\* in danger. Abuse is not just physical. Alienating children is abuse. Trying to involve children in things that really they should not be, to get leverage against you, is abuse.", "NTA. Do your kids seem to understand why your MIL says those things? I\u2019d be worried if that continued especially with the 9 and 5 year old. The things she is telling them are a hit cruel and maybe not she appropriate unless your kids are incredibly mature? Those are just difficult topics even for adults", "I think this reply is a little harsh but yea, OP, your actions are short sighted. Your mil is annoying, the less of her the better, but she isn\u2019t the issue here. \n\nIt sounds like you were dealing with a lot of trauma with your ex. It may have taken some time to process that. But now is the time to look 5,10, 15, 30 years down the road. \n\nWhat are you going to do when the money runs out? \n\nYou need a long term plan to get back to work. Make the money stretch further.

And when my mil talks shit on me, they tell me and we have a conversation about it so they have all the information. I'm honest and straight forward with my kids about pretty much everything. I like to let them make their own choices in regards to their relationships with family.\n\nWhile I understand what everyone is saying about cutting her off, I still feel the choice is up to my kids as long as they're not in any real danger, and honestly I don't know how she would retaliate against me for it if it was my choice.
