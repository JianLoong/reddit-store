If anything happens to the little one, I would never forgive myself.\n\nMy friends have been made aware, they know, they respect it, and I never had to take care of their kids.\n\nNTA, if your BF is too scared to do it on his own, this is not your issue. If he doesn't feel up to the task, and you don't want to do it with him, he has to accept this.

That's not \"triggered\", that's thinking ahead.", "Nah I think her attitude in general seems pretty selfish and would find in unlikable", "BINGO! It\u2019s about his image around other people.", "Im not child free (I have multiple kids) and I whole heartedly agree. NTA. I\u2019ve only watched a friend\u2019s child because of a death in their family and their emergent need to travel. I\u2019ve never babysat for anyone and have zero desire to do so. If I\u2019m visiting and hold a baby for a little, the second that kid starts to fuss back to a parent it goes. And I don\u2019t ask to hold people\u2019s babies anyway. I\u2019d be really uncomfortable with my husband/partner volunteering my time and effort. Nope. He wants to babysit that\u2019s awesome but that his commitment and effort not yours.", "His expectations for a \u201cgood wife\u201d don\u2019t sync with her ability to think for herself.", "Could this be something his mother started? Could she be pressuring him to tie the knot? Musing about grandchildren and how swapping babysitting will be part of the big, happy family picture?", "THIS! All this is very important!", "Are you saying if the kids are related in any way, caring for them isn\u2019t babysitting; only if a stranger does it? OP never indicated she wouldn\u2019t spend time with the extended family.", "How is babysitting a bunch of other people\u2019s kids \u201csupporting her boyfriend\u201d??", "It sounds like it came from a mom who can\u2019t wait for grandchildren. She thinks the sisters in law will trade babysitting in the family \u201cvillage\u201d.", "Good one.", "He wants a \u201cvillage\u201d, complete with the gender roles of an agrarian society.", "I completely agree with your take. Although the information we have is limited, this makes the most sense. It\u2019s not about some the bf being some controlling misogynist, it\u2019s much more about the value that he seems to place in family and interacting with children, clearly he is taken aback by her response and is upset because he might prefer someone who likes kids more.", "Some women take in the children of their husband\u2019s affairs and raise them. js", "Wish I would have saw this before I went to google aggregate haha", "That would make sense. \"Now Bobby, when your sister has kids, I expect you and Susie to babysit so she and hubby can have regular date nights, it takes a village\", neither expecting Susie to balk.", "Don\u2019t forget to ask if he\u2019s going to care for his own children, or if that\u2019s \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d.", "You sound bitter.", "LOL! This is just too precious.", "Who\u2019s getting hysterical? ;)", "How DARE you make him babysit children that don't exist all by himself with no help from you??? How can you expect him to babysit imaginary children all by himself? What if there is pretend poop in their nonexistent diapers, or they run into a road that isn't there and get hit by a hypothetical car?", "NAH This seems to be a fundamental incompatibility and not some misogynistic crusade to force OP into being some maternal homemaker and domestic servant for the bf. This would be a big deal. I come from a family of \u201cit takes a village\u201d and what bf describes is completely accepted and encouraged for us. You\u2019re not wrong for having your boundaries, that\u2019s normal too. But this is a sign of some big differences in values/attitudes that are bugger than just this situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are right to say you will only babysit in an emergency for these potential kids and if your bf chooses he can do otherwise. Your bf really needs to experience what babysitting is like before he claims he would do it. I bet he is upset because he imagines him playing with cute kids and you doing most of the icky work or taking over when he is done playing with his living dolls. \n\nMaybe he kind of wants kids and is seeing that you are less compatible for the future.\n\n\nWhen I was in my 20\u2019s and my siblings started having kids I became their child care provider. I was unpaid or underpaid. I liked the kids and was happy to help then because I had free time.  Then I had my own baby and they had more kids. There was the expectation that I would continue to care for 5 kids under 5 years old. Even happy kids can be tiring. There were no reciprocal offers of child care or favors. My own child was not an easy kid. I finally had to tell them they needed to make other child care arrangements so I could focus on my own family. They were not thrilled and acted like I was a selfish bum because I was a sahm unlike people with actual jobs like them. I learned that people will use your affection for their kids or your desire to be helpful and tromp all over you.  It is good to establish your boundaries firmly from the start so no one gets upset or resentful later.", "NTA, limits on kids are personal preference. My family is full of kids and I don't babysit for the sake of it. If sister has an appointment and can't trail 4 kids behind her then I will in an emergency, but she can only leave the kids that are old enough and capable of going to the bathroom themselves. I don't do nappies or wiping bums. I'm the only child free sib so my sibs know these are my limits. If there is a situation happening I'll offer/they'll ask and if I'm free I will, but if I have plans already I won't change them unless it's a real emergency. But like you said, it's all hypothetical and preferences can change. By the time it's all happening things might be different, and if not, you've set your boundaries. They should be respected.", "NTA. You are making a personal boundary clear. He\u2019s more than welcome to volunteer his time to babysit, but you won\u2019t be part of it. It\u2019s weird he\u2019s getting so upset about this.", "I disagree -- I think insisting that someone else volunteer to do something that you aren't willing to do yourself is wrong.", "I mean i understand that the kids are hypothetical right now, but it\u2019s definitely a good conversation to have so that you both are on the same page as the relationship progresses. \n\nPersonally, i have one kid and i don\u2019t like other people watching him and i don\u2019t like being responsible for other people\u2019s kids either.\nI can count on one hand the times i\u2019ve watched anyone\u2019s children alone, and i absolutely don\u2019t drive with them. Too much risk and responsibility. \nI don\u2019t want to have someone else\u2019s entire world in my care.", "I was going to write just this! I haven\u2019t even babysat my nephews for more than minutes (rocking the stroller while sis runs to the bathroom and those kind of things) and as far as I know, no one resents me for that. I\u2019ve been helping out frying an ungodly amount of pancakes for nephews birthday party and things like that, but never babysitting for anybody\u2019s date night!", "I think the same. If he was only a little upset, maybe they could compromise, but this seems really important to him.", "i\u2019m the same, i love kids but i don\u2019t understand how people take full responsibility for others children when they aren\u2019t present. anything could happen, you\u2019re caring for someone\u2019s entire world\ntoo much responsibility to take on casually for me", "[removed]", ">  I'm the only child free sib so my sibs know these are my limits.", "People have boundaries. You may not be comfortable with babysitting, but there are other ways to show support", "Info - did you tell him you don't like kids during this conversation? \n\n>I do not neglect or act unkind to children even if I don\u2019t like them or want them arou\n\nThis stands out to me along with his reaction. I don't know your relationship but it sounds like he hopes to have kids one day and you not being interested in helping family/friends kids is showing him that you don't want kids. Idk, could be a reach but it sounds like this conversation was kind of eye opening to both of you and the kind of futures you want.", "NTA. This is someone who will dump all childcare on you if you procreate with him. Best of luck to you.", "Finally some logic. Some of the comments are wild here. This would be a deal breaker for me as well. I adore having my nieces/nephews over for the weekend and love to help out when I can. While OP is definitely not an asshole for not wanting to be a part of that, someone like op would be incompatible with those values.", "I think this is a point I should make. I agree involvement and babysitting are quite different but just have cross over duties. I think it\u2019s also about my own consent to willingly take care of another persons child that was dismissed so I was much more against any extra interaction.", "He knows my opinions on having our own kids as we\u2019ve talked about it before. This was just the first time we talked about babysitting for other people. Something he has never done and apparently doesn\u2019t want to do alone.", "Came here to say this, glad I was beaten to the punch!"]}
