You should have done the dishes, but you are right about everything else. She's a bigger asshole than you are. I don't think it was wrong of you to say that you are raising her children if you are.

Both of those groups make mistakes. \n\nOP didn\u2019t choose not to do the dishes- they forgot. Forgetting one chore out of many doesn\u2019t make one an asshole.

OP is a still a child with other responsibilities- homework. Their own mental health. \n\nChild or not, no one deserves to be yelled at for forgetting a task. The dishes can be done later. There is a solution. Mom has absolutely *failed* to control herself and is relying on OP being a perfect parent/household manager; if this child makes a mistake, mom has *no* emotional backbone on which to stand. \n\nIf OP is being treated like an adult in every area of household life, it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous for this \u201cmother\u201d to think she has the right to punish them for doing *only* 90% of the household work.", "I should\u2019ve put it earlier but I buckled my toddler siblings in, they\u2019re 2-4", "OP was 12 when she started taking care of her siblings and is now 16.
