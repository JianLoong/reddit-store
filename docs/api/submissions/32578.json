You communicated that she was delusional for how she expected YOU PERSONALLY to desire to be a part of her ensemble. You didn't criticize her relationship dynamic in general, but told her to respect your boundary that you wanted no part of it. It IS delusional and rude to keep pressuring you to be more in her life than you want to be. Her self-esteem is not your responsibility, and if her sense of self really depends on having the men she wants hanging on her arm regardless of their own consent, she needs to be put in either therapy, or an institution, cuz if she doesn't understand basic consent I'd have concerns about sexploitation or coersion being a part of her relationships.", "Yeah no means no and as for the feeling of undesirable and self esteem it's called welcome to fucking reality.
