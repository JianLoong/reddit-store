About 2 days in she told me she was autistic, at the time I didn\u2019t really care because it\u2019s not gonna affect how she works or the people around it hopefully. She works from 5-7 which as I listed before is pretty hectic. So last Wednesday she came to asking if she could use the office for when she gets overwhelmed, I said sure but she couldn\u2019t be in there to long since I also have work to do in the office, so we\u2019d agree that she could use it when ever she needed except when I had to use it. So Monday we started selling Christmas themed snacks and drinks, so of course it got even louder and now she complaining to me that she can still hear noise. She been complaining all week and Friday I\u2019d gotten tired of it and told her that it\u2019s her fault for choosing a job that involves so many people and it\u2019s not my responsibility to make sure it\u2019s \u201cnice and quiet\u201d for her in the office. We got into an argument where I basically told her to quit because we won\u2019t miss her because for half her shift she\u2019s in the back. I still stand by my point I just feel guilty about being so harsh about it, because her autism isn\u2019t her fault but it\u2019s neither my responsibility to deal with it, it\u2019s hers.ps ignore my user I made this account a year ago", "created_utc": 1671385975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp42ow/aita_for_telling_the_autistic_she_should_just_quit/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is TA because she should have gotten a $6 pair of headphones that do nothing but block noise, like for construction work or gun firing noise protection, and kept them in the office. And if she's missing her job for half the time, you should have warned her and then fired her. It's reasonable to go back to the office for four or five minutes every hour or two to pull herself together, but it's also on her to provide basic stuff like EARPLUGS.", "You\u2019re a total asshole.

She should be looking for a new job, yes. But that doesn't make OP NOT the AH for her behavior. Correct response is as another poster put.

I\u2019m the only shift manager during that time.

You need to get the owner of the company involved because this is a lawsuit waiting to happen. You are responsible for the accommodations not her. She has a legitimate disability and it is your responsibility as the manager to make sure she has the appropriate equipment/accommodations. \n\nI will give you some slack because of your age but you should not be in management as your are not mature enough or have the education to know the legal ramifications of what can happen if you discriminate against her which is what you are doing at the moment. Being a manager and yelling at an employee is not appropriate EVER. Please take some management classes associated with HR if you want to continue in the role.", "You absolutely refuse to take any accountability or acknowledge that you acted wrongly. How did she know the office would be too loud ahead of time? She let you know day 1 that she is autistic. And now she is letting you know that she's struggling and needs help.
