The basics of our job is that you get to choose your shifts a week prior and it\u2019s almost always busy from 4:30-8pm. Recently a new employee joined about 2 week ago. About 2 days in she told me she was autistic, at the time I didn\u2019t really care because it\u2019s not gonna affect how she works or the people around it hopefully. She works from 5-7 which as I listed before is pretty hectic. So last Wednesday she came to asking if she could use the office for when she gets overwhelmed, I said sure but she couldn\u2019t be in there to long since I also have work to do in the office, so we\u2019d agree that she could use it when ever she needed except when I had to use it. So Monday we started selling Christmas themed snacks and drinks, so of course it got even louder and now she complaining to me that she can still hear noise. She been complaining all week and Friday I\u2019d gotten tired of it and told her that it\u2019s her fault for choosing a job that involves so many people and it\u2019s not my responsibility to make sure it\u2019s \u201cnice and quiet\u201d for her in the office. We got into an argument where I basically told her to quit because we won\u2019t miss her because for half her shift she\u2019s in the back. I still stand by my point I just feel guilty about being so harsh about it, because her autism isn\u2019t her fault but it\u2019s neither my responsibility to deal with it, it\u2019s hers.ps ignore my user I made this account a year ago Also P.S it\u2019s a family run caf\u00e9 so I don\u2019t know if the ADA rules apply", "created_utc": 1671385975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp42ow/aita_for_telling_the_autistic_she_should_just_quit/", "score": 1004, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As an autistic person myself (not The Autistic), accommodations are required for disabled people in the USA. Telling her to quit is not an accommodation. Great way to set your store up for a lawsuit and I hope she knows it.", "YTA, it's not your fault that she's having these issues nor that you can't really do anything about it (or can you? If you'd want), but there really isn't a reason to be an AH about it to her.\n\nHaving said that you're 17 and you've got much to learn.

Even if you are convinced your not the AH, you're abviously not happy with how things went and maybe you can grow in this.", "ESH here. Your attitude is terrible, I feel bad for those you manage. She is TA because she should have gotten a $6 pair of headphones that do nothing but block noise, like for construction work or gun firing noise protection, and kept them in the office. And if she's missing her job for half the time, you should have warned her and then fired her. It's reasonable to go back to the office for four or five minutes every hour or two to pull herself together, but it's also on her to provide basic stuff like EARPLUGS.", "You\u2019re a total asshole. You refuse to accommodate an autistic kid, and you went off on her because she is having trouble coping during her shift.

You should have calmly and professionally had a separate conversation.

Check out the ADA laws.\n\nCouldn't she just have a shift change to a less busy time?

You can use this as a learning curb in life", "Since you're only 17, heres some info. There's something called the Americans with disabilities act, and autism falls under it. She was required to ask for an accommodation for her disability,  and she did. You decided on your own to only partially comply (only when you aren't using the office)  Your managers needed to know she was autistic as soon as you found out. Theres no guarantee she could have been accommodated, but that wasn't your call, its not your pay grade. YTA.", "NTA\n\nFire her.

It\u2019s ironic that you think someone with a disability shouldn\u2019t work there , when you yourself obviously lack the skill for the job you have. YTA.

I hope that poor girl takes all the action against you she can. Another YTA for good measure", "YTA but the biggest TA in all of this is whatever company hired a 17-year-old to do the job of a management position rather than pay for a worker with actual experience in how to handle managing people, not just posting a schedule. \n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act which is a federal law, yes, work accommodations need to be made. You have been given zero training in how to handle these kinds of situations. Next time speak to the employees you manage respectfully and take any situations you are not trained to handle up a chain of command, don't just snap at someone\n\nedit clarity", "going against the grain here and saying ESH, it sounds like your response to her was aggressive and harsh but also your point is valid, if someone is unable to do the job (in this case it\u2019s being up front and helping customers) then they need to find a different job. It\u2019s not fair to you or other coworkers that she can come in to her shift and then not actually work for most of it. I would tell her she can take quick 5-10 minute breaks but that  she still needs to be a team member and work during her shift, and if that\u2019s too hard for her then maybe it\u2019s not the right job for her.", "YTA for how you spoke to her, and you definitely mishandled this situation.\n\nYou\u2019re a minor and it sounds like you were dropped into a management position with little or no training, which isn\u2019t your fault. A situation like this is something that you should refer up to your boss (hopefully an adult who does have some training?), HR, or someone else in authority in your company who has knowledge of reasonable accommodations and the ADA (if you\u2019re in the US). Your best move now is to apologize to the employee and let her know you will consult with higher-ups about available accommodations.", "YTA\n\nLook, **VOREME\\_0W0**, what you did was heinously shitty. I get it, hearing people vent constantly sucks, but you're in a position of authority and you're obliged to a level of professionalism that matches your position. That will sometimes include listening to someone beneath your rank complain endlessly. What matters most is whether their conduct is genuinely getting in the way of productivity, and even than there are better ways of going about it, better ways of saying it.\n\nSo, yes, **VOREME\\_0W0**, you are the asshole.", "YTA - You are obliged to make reasonable adjustments / accommodations for anyone with a disability, and autism would being included in that, as apart if the ADA. So it *is* your responsibility as a manager to make those adjustments. And adjustments that allow her to be on the floor rather than in the office, as being in the office is preventing her from doing her job.\n\nHowever, you need to be told this and given some proper training. And by the sounds of it, so do the rest of the management team. This should not be being left to a 17 year old, even if it would be part of the role of shift manager.\n\nBut telling someone to quit and that they won\u2019t be missed is really awful behaviour, which you could (and in my opinion should be) facing disciplinary action for.

A manager should be much more professional when talking to employees; then again I don\u2019t know what should be expected from a 17 year old. I\u2019m saying YTA because being young isn\u2019t a good reason to communicate like that at all, but whoever decided to make a 17 year old a manager is also the ah", "So:\n\n- If your employee is autistic and requesting an accommodation, you have to make a reasonable effort to accommodate that request.\n- I wouldn't expect you to know that, because it sounds like you haven't been trained in any way in regard to legal liability, discrimination claims, disability and protected class status, etc. That's not your fault, but you're still putting the company you work for at risk through your actions. I also don't really care about that per say, bc any company that wouldn't train you in these areas or have a higher-level manager address this issue with the employee instead of you is probably not a great company lol.\n- All of that being said, you need to try to find a reasonable solution. Having her in the back all the time doesn't work, and suggesting she quit doesn't work either. Something like noise-reducing earplugs or headphones may be the solution. I highly recommend Loop Experience earplugs, they're like $35 aaaaand reduce noise by about 20 decibels. You can still hear, but it reduces the sensory overload.\n\nGently, YTA", "She can't control her autism like you said and she should be allowed to work even with it.\n\nYTA", "Let's not all forget... SHE'S 17!!!! Tbh, YTA, specifically for what you said. That was not necessary or appropriate for a well trained manager to say, but I HIGHLY doubt that any place that puts a 17-year-old in charge would properly train you. Talk to HR or a higher up about noise canceling headphones AND proper training on disability accommodations. I don't really think you meant to be mean as you are ONLY 17 YRS. OLD, but unless you plan on leaving this place anyway, it would be in your best interest to get more training on how to handle these types of situations moving forward.", "YTA and you\u2019re nowhere near mature enough to be a manager anywhere", "YTA.  It might happen now, but definitely in the future statements like that will get you in trouble.  Sometimes jobs are not a good fit for people.  If possible, reasonable accommodations should be made.  You should have pulled in your manager, had them handle it, let them know objectively, the issues the employee had with noise.  Perhaps, different shifts would be a better fit for that employee.  Bottom line, manager needs to handle it, accommodations you made did not work, left you short handed.", "I agree that this is probably not the job for someone with her issues, but being a manager means you have to talk to people in a responsible manner and in accordance with HR standards and federal laws, which you didn't. Maybe do some online reading of how to deal with someone on your staff who has a disability, but, yes, YTA, for the way you spoke to her, but not your concerns with her performance.", "Whoever made you a manager is really TA here. You\u2019re not equipped or mature enough to manage your emotions let alone other employees, especially someone who is autistic.

I doubt you\u2019re technically a manager on the books if this is a mom and pop shop. \n\nYour boss should be the one exploring and providing reasonable accommodations for her to accomplish her job. If she can\u2019t reasonably be expected to do her job with the accommodations your workplace can provide, then she might not be harmful for her health to continue to work there.

Which could be a reasonable accommodation.", "You incredibly ignorant and should always think how you can support someone\u2019s needs before mouthing off.

You have no business speaking to *ANYONE* like that, let alone someone who happens to be neurodivergent! What you did is not only inappropriate, it is unprofessional! Shame on you! You cannot treat employees that way! You cannot go around treating anyone that way, as I've already stated! \n\nWere you not properly trained in management? Because your people skills are abysmal and essentially nonexistent. You also have zero empathy. Which is extremely concerning, considering the power you wield above her and others as their manager.

You shouldn\u2019t be in this position in the first place obviously, if this is how you deal with stress and handling your employees. You likely lack the training, I completely understand but part of your job as a manager is to manage situations like this, not go nuclear and become belligerent.", "As an Autistic female, I am incensed at your behaviour in this situation. I don't often post, especially in here, but I needed to say my piece. When someone has sensory overload and starts going into shutdown/meltdown, not only is this physically painful, but it can get really ugly, and is horribly embarrassing for the person experiencing this as we literally can't stop it. A **safe, quiet** space for a little bit can really do wonders. \n\nThere are things that can be done to mitigate, as others have mentioned, headphones, changing role etc, perhaps these could be options.

They may not have had any comprehension as to what they would be agreeing to when accepting the role in this business. \n\nAll we really want is some compassion and understanding. \n\nPerhaps things could have been done differently on your end as an inexperienced human walking this path, so please, do right by this person. Sit down and talk to them and discuss this. If it comes to be the role isn't right so be it. Direct communication is key.

I am autistic and certain kinds of noises can derail my focus and concentration so certain jobs just don't work for me. That being said, it seemed like you have a hostile and impatient attitude towards her that along with youth and inexperience made this situation worse. Not accusing you, only you know how you feel. But this situation should've been a conversation to have in private, with an adult in the room with you, before the shift started. It required being proactive, not reactive. She could've been given jobs that require less conversation like bussing tables, etc., and allowed for her to use earphones. \n\nHandling this situation was way above your pay grade and it was not okay to leave you to handle this alone. This is part of a skill-set, managing disabilities, that you can develop and hone. Your employer would be wise to consult an employment attorney for help and legal advice   going forward so this doesn't happen again. I went into office work instead of retail and found out I had a happy talent for law office work. They also follow employment law scrupulously so that was a bonus. I do wish you both well.
