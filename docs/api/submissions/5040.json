The basics of our job is that you get to choose your shifts a week prior and it\u2019s almost always busy from 4:30-8pm. Recently a new employee joined about 2 week ago. About 2 days in she told me she was autistic, at the time I didn\u2019t really care because it\u2019s not gonna affect how she works or the people around it hopefully. She works from 5-7 which as I listed before is pretty hectic. So last Wednesday she came to asking if she could use the office for when she gets overwhelmed, I said sure but she couldn\u2019t be in there to long since I also have work to do in the office, so we\u2019d agree that she could use it when ever she needed except when I had to use it. So Monday we started selling Christmas themed snacks and drinks, so of course it got even louder and now she complaining to me that she can still hear noise. She been complaining all week and Friday I\u2019d gotten tired of it and told her that it\u2019s her fault for choosing a job that involves so many people and it\u2019s not my responsibility to make sure it\u2019s \u201cnice and quiet\u201d for her in the office. We got into an argument where I basically told her to quit because we won\u2019t miss her because for half her shift she\u2019s in the back. I still stand by my point I just feel guilty about being so harsh about it, because her autism isn\u2019t her fault but it\u2019s neither my responsibility to deal with it, it\u2019s hers.ps ignore my user I made this account a year ago Also P.S it\u2019s a family run caf\u00e9 so I don\u2019t know if the ADA rules apply", "created_utc": 1671385975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp42ow/aita_for_telling_the_autistic_she_should_just_quit/", "score": 3337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was required to ask for an accommodation for her disability,  and she did.

I hope that poor girl takes all the action against you she can. Another YTA for good measure", "YTA but the biggest TA in all of this is whatever company hired a 17-year-old to do the job of a management position rather than pay for a worker with actual experience in how to handle managing people, not just posting a schedule. \n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act which is a federal law, yes, work accommodations need to be made. You have been given zero training in how to handle these kinds of situations.

It\u2019s not fair to you or other coworkers that she can come in to her shift and then not actually work for most of it. I would tell her she can take quick 5-10 minute breaks but that  she still needs to be a team member and work during her shift, and if that\u2019s too hard for her then maybe it\u2019s not the right job for her.", "YTA for how you spoke to her, and you definitely mishandled this situation.\n\nYou\u2019re a minor and it sounds like you were dropped into a management position with little or no training, which isn\u2019t your fault. A situation like this is something that you should refer up to your boss (hopefully an adult who does have some training?), HR, or someone else in authority in your company who has knowledge of reasonable accommodations and the ADA (if you\u2019re in the US). Your best move now is to apologize to the employee and let her know you will consult with higher-ups about available accommodations.", "YTA\n\nLook, **VOREME\\_0W0**, what you did was heinously shitty. I get it, hearing people vent constantly sucks, but you're in a position of authority and you're obliged to a level of professionalism that matches your position. That will sometimes include listening to someone beneath your rank complain endlessly. What matters most is whether their conduct is genuinely getting in the way of productivity, and even than there are better ways of going about it, better ways of saying it.\n\nSo, yes, **VOREME\\_0W0**, you are the asshole.", "YTA - You are obliged to make reasonable adjustments / accommodations for anyone with a disability, and autism would being included in that, as apart if the ADA. So it *is* your responsibility as a manager to make those adjustments. And adjustments that allow her to be on the floor rather than in the office, as being in the office is preventing her from doing her job.\n\nHowever, you need to be told this and given some proper training. And by the sounds of it, so do the rest of the management team. This should not be being left to a 17 year old, even if it would be part of the role of shift manager.\n\nBut telling someone to quit and that they won\u2019t be missed is really awful behaviour, which you could (and in my opinion should be) facing disciplinary action for.

A manager should be much more professional when talking to employees; then again I don\u2019t know what should be expected from a 17 year old.

I also don't really care about that per say, bc any company that wouldn't train you in these areas or have a higher-level manager address this issue with the employee instead of you is probably not a great company lol.\n- All of that being said, you need to try to find a reasonable solution. Having her in the back all the time doesn't work, and suggesting she quit doesn't work either. Something like noise-reducing earplugs or headphones may be the solution. I highly recommend Loop Experience earplugs, they're like $35 aaaaand reduce noise by about 20 decibels. You can still hear, but it reduces the sensory overload.\n\nGently, YTA", "She can't control her autism like you said and she should be allowed to work even with it.\n\nYTA", "Let's not all forget... SHE'S 17!!!! Tbh, YTA, specifically for what you said. That was not necessary or appropriate for a well trained manager to say, but I HIGHLY doubt that any place that puts a 17-year-old in charge would properly train you. Talk to HR or a higher up about noise canceling headphones AND proper training on disability accommodations. I don't really think you meant to be mean as you are ONLY 17 YRS. OLD, but unless you plan on leaving this place anyway, it would be in your best interest to get more training on how to handle these types of situations moving forward.", "YTA and you\u2019re nowhere near mature enough to be a manager anywhere", "YTA.  It might happen now, but definitely in the future statements like that will get you in trouble.  Sometimes jobs are not a good fit for people.  If possible, reasonable accommodations should be made.  You should have pulled in your manager, had them handle it, let them know objectively, the issues the employee had with noise.  Perhaps, different shifts would be a better fit for that employee.  Bottom line, manager needs to handle it, accommodations you made did not work, left you short handed.", "I agree that this is probably not the job for someone with her issues, but being a manager means you have to talk to people in a responsible manner and in accordance with HR standards and federal laws, which you didn't. Maybe do some online reading of how to deal with someone on your staff who has a disability, but, yes, YTA, for the way you spoke to her, but not your concerns with her performance.", "Whoever made you a manager is really TA here. You\u2019re not equipped or mature enough to manage your emotions let alone other employees, especially someone who is autistic.

I doubt you\u2019re technically a manager on the books if this is a mom and pop shop. \n\nYour boss should be the one exploring and providing reasonable accommodations for her to accomplish her job. If she can\u2019t reasonably be expected to do her job with the accommodations your workplace can provide, then she might not be harmful for her health to continue to work there. If noisy and crowded areas are going to be overwhelming then food service and retail are going to stress her out unless she\u2019s only on the slow shifts. Which could be a reasonable accommodation.", "You incredibly ignorant and should always think how you can support someone\u2019s needs before mouthing off.

You have no business speaking to *ANYONE* like that, let alone someone who happens to be neurodivergent! What you did is not only inappropriate, it is unprofessional! Shame on you! You cannot treat employees that way! You cannot go around treating anyone that way, as I've already stated! \n\nWere you not properly trained in management? Because your people skills are abysmal and essentially nonexistent. You also have zero empathy. Which is extremely concerning, considering the power you wield above her and others as their manager.

You shouldn\u2019t be in this position in the first place obviously, if this is how you deal with stress and handling your employees. You likely lack the training, I completely understand but part of your job as a manager is to manage situations like this, not go nuclear and become belligerent.", "As an Autistic female, I am incensed at your behaviour in this situation. I don't often post, especially in here, but I needed to say my piece. When someone has sensory overload and starts going into shutdown/meltdown, not only is this physically painful, but it can get really ugly, and is horribly embarrassing for the person experiencing this as we literally can't stop it. A **safe, quiet** space for a little bit can really do wonders. \n\nThere are things that can be done to mitigate, as others have mentioned, headphones, changing role etc, perhaps these could be options.

They may not have had any comprehension as to what they would be agreeing to when accepting the role in this business. \n\nAll we really want is some compassion and understanding. \n\nPerhaps things could have been done differently on your end as an inexperienced human walking this path, so please, do right by this person. Sit down and talk to them and discuss this. If it comes to be the role isn't right so be it. Direct communication is key.

Also, the business needs to have 15 or more employees in order for ADA to apply, and we don't have enough info here to know if it does or doesn't have that.  And you're 17.  No one is going to sue a 17 year old for an ADA violation.  Your delivery could have been softer, like \"Maybe this job isn't the best fit for you.\"  It's reasonable to expect that you or the other employees will have to do work harder to perform her job duties for her while she's getting paid to hang out in the back office.  And I say this as an autistic person, myself.  Sometimes it's just not a good fit.", "I'm just wondering why you didn't consult anyone higher up while this was going on. This situation could have been handled with more care and respect. Since you're 17, consider it a teachable moment. Managing isn't just about getting things done. It's about managing humans too.

You could just say \"employee.\" \n\nI don't think it was just the noise level in decibels, but the kind of noise that was the problem and this girl might want to reconsider retail/food service jobs in the future. I am autistic and certain kinds of noises can derail my focus and concentration so certain jobs just don't work for me. That being said, it seemed like you have a hostile and impatient attitude towards her that along with youth and inexperience made this situation worse. Not accusing you, only you know how you feel. But this situation should've been a conversation to have in private, with an adult in the room with you, before the shift started. It required being proactive, not reactive. She could've been given jobs that require less conversation like bussing tables, etc., and allowed for her to use earphones. \n\nHandling this situation was way above your pay grade and it was not okay to leave you to handle this alone. This is part of a skill-set, managing disabilities, that you can develop and hone. Your employer would be wise to consult an employment attorney for help and legal advice   going forward so this doesn't happen again. I went into office work instead of retail and found out I had a happy talent for law office work. They also follow employment law scrupulously so that was a bonus. I do wish you both well.

She can't monopolize an entire workspace rendering it unusable and certainly not the majority of her shift. \nNext, I know my autism, so there are certain jobs I just wouldn't even try to work at. Large groups of people and noise overwhelm me, so a busy Starbucks, or a big box store or a daycare, etc., wouldn't be somewhere I would apply.

All those accommodations and laws everyone talks about would require a worker to be upfront with it. Discuss it openly. Talk about what they can and can't do. \nYou all act like having autism is taking away all her responsibilities towards her employer and making her absolutely unable to navigate through work related situations herself. \nIf I couldn't work half the time, I wouldn't work that job. \nIf I would need accommodations due to the workplace /-pace or whatever I would need to be upfront with it.\nAnd to get those accommodations you sit down and talk actively about options.

I'm older then you and I am not sure if I would have acted better being confronted with unprofessional behavior like that.\n\nDon't let all those people talk you down.

Those are steps she needs to take, and then submit the claim to you, her manager. \n\nIf she\u2019s not doing her work, and disappearing for significant parts of her shift then you can address that as the manager.

The way you speak to someone can hurt you just as much as them. It's better to call them differently ables, like my daughter says (she has Cerebral Palsy) than by their ability or disability. Your boss needs to do awareness training for the whole crew. Next time you see her, apologize for your words. Ask her if there's a way to accommodate her that can also help the store at the same time. Whether it's filing or stocking or making boxes or displays, there's a way to help each other. When she's overwhelmed, she can go to the backroom and work on a side project. And I may be a minority but NAH. You're young and new to the manager role. With training, you'll get better.", "Nta but also TA for how you worded it. My brother has autism and works in a factory. Yes you should have accomodations for sensory overload, which you have put in place for the most part.

The closest one I could choose is ESH, but it is just really obvious that the situation is complicated.\n\nI think I understand your point of view. Essentially, someone who factually does no work for a major part of their shift and probalby makes other workers more loaded with work can be seen as freeloading.\n\nFrom her point of view, there can be several possibilities, but it seems like the most likely one is that she's young and unexperienced, she probably thought she could handle it, bit overestimated herself.\n\nFrom business point of view, she is an asset that in current circumstances cannot be used to a good enough extent. But question is, can these circumstances be changed so that she could be more productive, like giving her shifts with less busy atmosphere or part-time office work? In a way, companies are obligated to do it by law. Common sense dictates, though, that if there are only jobs that she can't handle available, she'll need to leave.\n\nNow, it seems to me that you jumped straight to the obvoius solution instead of trying to be more flexible, to find better place for her. That is understandable, you are young and, as you said, have no training and were made to sink or swim. And perhaps even with your current knowledge, you won't be able to solve the problem yourself. Think of whether to bring it forward to your boss(es) or company lawyer, but only if you're absolutely sure they'll be on your side and not throw you under the bus... I think the possibility is low. People in other comments said enough about this.\n\nBut also before you do anything, apologize to her.

Hopefully you can find a solution that works for everyone.", "Nta", "Ooooh... that wasn't handled well but you're leaning from it. But I get it.

But still the way you talked to her is an AH move. \n\nOn her side, you're right having autism is absolutely not her fault. At the same time, it's no one else's job to accommodate her autism. Choosing a job that triggers her stress to the point where she needs to hide in the back for half the shift isn't okay. Her going to the back means other workers have to pick up her slack. It may sound harsh, but at that point, it would objectively be better to replace her with someone who does not have these sensitivities. Again, the autism is not her fault, but it's not the other workers' jobs to add to their own workload to accommodate it either. \n\nFinally, the owner of the place is the real AH. Who gives this much responsibility to a 17 year old?", "NTA. She is in fact working in a place where noise will be a problem. Working a different shift might help, but it's not really fair to the other workers to have someone running to the office when overwhelmed. This might not be the job for her.

She can only work on the busiest time of day because she has \"things to to\" for the rest of the day, she wants to hide in your office for half of her shift, etc. It sounds like she shouldn't be working there. A 3 hour shift is NOT that big of a deal, and if she can't even handle that without hiding out in your office for half of it, she should not be employed there. I say this as a neurodivergent person and as someone who's PTSD is triggered by loud noise, that is one of the reasons I refuse to take another retail or food service job, because I know I cannot handle it without not doing my job properly.\n\nI have a lot of empathy for other disabled people, and I am more than willing to understand that they need accommodations. However, expecting to be allowed to not work for an already short shift and be paid the same as everyone else because you can't handle the noise level in a busy cafe is ridiculous. That's not an accommodation, that's her (either intentionally or not) taking advantage of the business she is employed by. There are several jobs that are not as high-pressure that she can work at, but she chose this one. She can go get another job if she has such a huge problem with the noise.", "YTA. why the fuck did you phrase it like that", "YTA for how you said it, but you do kinda make sense.

I commend you for thinking the best of your employee when she revealed she is autistic. Tbh she didn\u2019t go about this in the right way either, and should not have disclosed her disability and asked for accommodation without proper ADA, however sometimes you feel you can trust an employer and I get that, or she\u2019s just naive.  \nAs a manager you will have to make accommodations for your employees. If there\u2019s someone up the ladder from you, I suggest you bring disability related accommodation requests to them. Ask the employee to put their request in writing if it is anything beyond what the rest of the employees are receiving, like extra breaks. Sometimes an employee will ask for accommodations and they will be asking for something essentially unfair, that would fall into the category of them not being able to complete their job without \u201cunreasonable\u201d accommodations. If you are ever in that situation, which perhaps this is but I don\u2019t think I could tell, then you definitely need to talk to the hiring manager and whoever is above you managerially. \nYTA, but good luck, I don\u2019t think you are restricted to always being TA, and you are young and learning.", "although I do think she should have a personal way of mitigating her disability (noise cancelling headphones, ada accommodations, etc.) you should recommend this instead of doing what you did. YTA, but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I understand it can be difficult but you need to be kind in these situations. apologize to her and bring up options (i.e. mentioned before)", "YTA. You have no business being a manager.

I\u2019m actually more concerned about the fact you violated ADA law. Did anybody ever contact upper management or HR about her requested accommodations? \n\nLemme do a PSA: It IS your responsibility to \u2018deal with\u2019 it, as management she reports to either direct her to who handles these things. She legally asked you for an accommodation, you attempted it, it wasn\u2019t working as she perhaps wasn\u2019t completing her essential functions of the job. Accommodation requests are not a one and done deal but rather the ADA requires ongoing discussion about it. This is the big part- you can waive non-essential functions of the job and essential functions are always eligible accommodations. And even then, you are still to attempt to retain employment and work things out, such as transfer her to another shift, another but equal position. You cannot just decide they\u2019re being inconvenient to you and tell them they\u2019re stupid for trying and not knowing better and to get tf out. You were just being cruel and it was way too far. My advice is you call her up, apologize sincerely, then TRY IT AGAIN or risk losing your job and being sued.. I\u2019ve managed autistic folks before and they\u2019re not only really awesome people, but actually are the reason for my success as a manager cuz they think up better ways of doing things. Amazing things can happen when you treat someone as an equal worthy or respect.\n\nSweetie you really need to take your own advice to her and step down from management jobs- you ain\u2019t cut out for it and are a walking liability to anyone who hires you or works with you. You\u2019re a danger and a public menace. You should just quit. You should\u2019ve known better before taking this job if you cannot manage people properly and fairly.

Many organizations that I work with have no accessibility or disability sensitive training in the workplace \n- so we can't really blame her for how she managed the situation since she didn't have the resources to do it successfully \n- for thr employee with autism, reasonable accommodations would be to give her alternative shifts when it isn't so crowded or to her provide job modifications that make sense\n- with the ADA and accommodations, accommodations need to be REASONABLE - having the employee spend half the day in the back office or asking customers to be quiet are not the answer\n\nSorry for the long post!

In addition, if she could work a shift that wouldn't involve the same level of noise and stress, you really should have made that option available to her.  \n\nThat being said, the autistic employee really should have carefully considered if this was the right job for her.  Yeah, the ADA has regulations indicating that employers are responsible for making reasonable accommodations to employees, with an emphasis on \"reasonable.\"  Depending on the line of work and nature of the business, it's possible that there's no way for her to get her neurosensitivity issues dialed down and still be able to do the job effectively.", "Lighhht YTA leaning towards ESH.

Win win situation.", "I'm going with ESH. I get you were frustrated and don't have training on how to handle thos but the store managers or owners should take over.

She either needs to switch to a quieter shift or find a quieter job.", "YTA- ask about management training. Is she a good employee and can you use her to staff slower times allowing your stronger employees to handle the busy time?", "NAH\n\nThe way you handled the situation was wrong but you know that already, which is a good sign. All you need is to apologize to her and try and figure things out (change her shift if possible). Treat it as a lesson learned and be a more considerate person going forward. You'll be fine.

You weren't made a shift manager because you get stuff done, you were made a shift manager because a 17yo will ask for a fraction of the salary a person with relevant experience would. When people say you're mature for your age, 90% of the time they do that to make you do stuff they shouldn't be asking for. Like being a shift manager in a cafe.

I am going to attempt to try to help you navigate this a bit more, but oof.\n\nFirst- You CANNOT speak to employees like this. It was wrong, and you are 100% YTA for that.  You were rude, and it's not the way to handle this situation. But that's what happens when people are thrust into roles like this when they are too young and don't have training.\n\nHow you should have handled it, is sat her down after shift and talked to her about the fact that she is asking for too many accommodations (which she is btw) and that she needs to consider if this line of work is for her, because while you can work with her to give her some breaks from the crowds (everybody needs that during holiday work btw) she can't be off the floor for half her shift. Try to work with her, and offer to give a reference if she wants to try to find another job. Try to find if there are ways to have her do different things on the floor she can handle better. Do this calmly, with understanding, and have an actual conversation where the two of you work out what is best for all involved. \n\nYou don't just rudely say \"it's your fault for picking this job and you need to quit\"\n\nBut second and to part of my point - She is asking for too many accommodations, and most people in the comments aren't going to acknowledge that. Accommodations are meant to be reasonable, having to be away from her work for half her shift is not reasonable. She does need to manage herself better or does need to get a different job. You aren't actually wrong about that, just how you approached it and the assumption that she can't find a way to handle this job better. She could actually be fully capable of doing this job and it wasn't \"her fault\" for picking it. There are only so many types of jobs out there, there just needs to be adjusting.\n\nAnd thirdly for you and everybody else. Places that have young people with limited working experience (two years is limited) filling roles like management are not the type of place you want to be working at. Not OP, not the girl in question, not anybody in the comments. OP you are working at a mismanaged store where you were put in a situation that would be hard for anybody but is especially hard for someone with limited management experience and emotional immaturity (sorry that is not a knock on you just a reality of age). It's not a \"family\" run cafe. It's a small business taking advantage of a young girl to get out of hiring experienced management and having to pay them for that experience. Having two years floor experience does not automatically make you management material, nor does it mean they properly trained you to be in charge of other workers, because you haven't been as evidenced by what happened. \n\nThe ADA rules do apply, this girl could learn to cope with the job with proper accommodation - not what she is asking for now - and someone else could have handled all of this better for everybody involved. \n\nSorry for the wall of text but I am hoping maybe this gets through the noise of just insults and hopefully helps you understand that while you did handle this wrong, you aren't wrong that she can't keep asking to hide in the back, and that the real problem is you were not trained to handle this situation, and the owners were wrong to put BOTH of you in this position. \n\nOr this is bait, and you got exactly what you wanted...", "YTA.

The reasons you want her to quit is due to autistic traits. As a mother with an autistic child this hits home for me.

After all, she did give accomodations requested by the employee in terms of a safe space in the back office. She also offered a later (quieter) shift, but was turned down because the worker was unwilling to work a later shift.\n\nOverall, that doesn't paint OP as a person ignorant of the plight of the neurodivergent.
