Mom is only visiting, it's YOU he will have to live with after they leave. He needs to understand how badly your mother's complaints affect you, and your feelings should be important to him. Never mind your mom's tears, she knows what she says hurts you, so she doesn't get to tear up when you call her on it.", "NTA.  She's already demonstrated that she's going to be more hurtful than supportive on this issue.", "NTA.\n\nYour mum isn\u2019t a good parent. If she wants to push her insecurities onto you then she is a bad parent. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s a bad parent and you are 100% justified. SET FIRM BOUNDARIES. She comments on your weight=1 week without talking or something like that. Make it clear that you have an issue with this bad behaviour. You don\u2019t have to even talk to her. Just send her a text.", "You're not going to make her happy, she's bitter that you're getting married and isn't there day to day to take part in the planning.  I've been married 8 years and my mom still hates my wife because she's British and we spent a lot of time there before our wedding.  Sorry that you have to go through this, NTA.", "You will look perfect on your wedding day whatever weight you are. And if you think you will be undermined again say no, You want your dress to be a surprise on your wedding day. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You don't need someone - no matter who they are - making you feel shitty about a dress you love. And it sounds like no matter what dress you have, she'll find a way to make negative comments. She's lost her right to experience the \"joy\" of any of this, because she destroys it.", "NTA. You know she will ruin your day so skip that. It would be a terrible shame if she was given the opportunity to diminish your pleasure in the dress, and that is what she would try her utmost to do. If she complains either be selectively deaf or tell her she is reaping what she sowed.", "Hide the dress with a good friend. Tell your mom to sod off. Keep reminding her it\u2019s your body, not hers.", "NTA, and since you have already opened the honesty door with your comment about your accomplishments, I think you should keep walking through it. \n\n\u201cMom, your negative comments about my body during wedding dress shopping were incredibly hurtful and ruined the experience. I am not willing to risk you doing that to the dress I have picked out and love. Hopefully you can figure out how to keep your negative comments to yourself before the wedding day.\u201d", "NTA. I didn\u2019t invite my mother wedding dress shopping for this same reason. I know what she can be like and I would end up leaving without a dress.

Bring your dress to be fitted before her arrival so it's out of the house and can't be tampered with", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Planning a wedding is already stressful, planning one that presumably involves people from two different countries and potentially very different cultures is even more stress. Don't add more just to please your mother.\n\nIf you want to soften the blow maybe you could sell it to her as wanting to preserve the magic until your big day.

You have chosen the dress you love, and your mother will make more nasty comments to you. She will make you upset with the dress you have chosen. On your wedding day, you will  remember what she said at the fitting. You just don't need that negativity. Confront her or don't. It's up to you.

When we were shopping, you expressed how you didn\u2019t like any of the dresses I tried on, and that brought me to tears.
