Mick has been married twice. His first wife, Katie, is the mom to my nephew Conor (20m) and my niece Aoife (18f). She sadly died 12 years ago. I was actually really close to Katie. She treated me like her little sister and used to take me places with Con and Aoife. So my niblings and I have always been close.\n\nMick really didn't want the kids to grow up in a one parent household so he remarried within the year to Jennifer. They met 4ish months after Katie died at my parents house (Jennifer was our neighbor) and were married 9 months after Katie died.\n\nMick focused a lot back then on the kids needing two parents. He told my niblings that Jennifer could save them from falling into a pit and that she was lovely, worked with kids, so they should do their best to open up their hearts to her and let her in. I'd say after six months of marriage Mick realized the kids were not as okay with that as he wanted them to be and he told them Jennifer was now their mom and they should show more love to her, because she was their future. When Conor exploded and told him Jennifer was not going to be his future, Mick decided the only way forward was to enforce family day once a week (Sunday).\n\nMick and Jennifer had three kids together over the next five years. Con and Aoife never bonded with them which drove Mick crazy so he would push more for the forced bonding. He would also get very angry when Con and Aoife told him they didn't care about Jennifer and when they said he betrayed their mom and them by moving so fast.\n\nLast year Con stayed with them over Christmas when he was home from college. Mick figured this was the sign that Con and Aoife had adjusted now that they were \"basically adults\". But this year when Aoife was also at college they chose not to visit Mick, Jennifer and the kids at all. And both told him they had no plans for a visit and no time for him to visit. When he said they would still go and try to see them for a bit both told him they didn't want to see him.\n\nMick decided to vent this all to me the day after Christmas when we were at our parents house. Every time I tried to talk about something else he would dump way more on me. This was a big surprise to me because he always dismisses me as a kid and has told me before I'm not adult enough to talk to about \"grownup stuff\". I outright asked him to stop and he told me this was all my fault so I should shut up and let him talk. I asked what the hell he meant and our mom asked the same. He said I should have encouraged my niblings to give Jennifer a chance and to stop seeing his remarriage as a betrayal. He said I had way more power and then he called me a stupid little child. I asked him why he insisted on dumping on me and expected so much from me when I'm just a child. I told him none of this was on me and it was entirely on him. He yelled at me which mom and dad kicked him out for. But he's saying I was a brat to him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703759699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sqytq/aita_for_asking_my_brother_why_he_insists_on/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's a definite pattern of Mick being overwhelmed and not being able to take criticism or correction from anyone, and instead trying to force his way through and then getting mad when force doesn't work. What happened to you is a small-scale version of what your niece and nephew have gone through all their lives. Mick is looooooong overdue for an emotional growth spurt. It won't be easy on him, and I wouldn't bet on it happening. And it's all on him.", "NTA \n\nYou ever just read a description of someone and have a visceral reaction to who they are? I'm speculating here but I betcha he was cheating on Katie with Jennifer. Only literally insane people marry that fast after knowing each other, let alone after a spouse dies. \n\nHis actions towards you and his kids are just sad. They aren't the AH, nor are you.", "NTA. Your brother sounds controlling and self-centered. He thinks of himself as the patriarch who arranges things and wants people to go along. \n\nI'm gonna bet he sets the rules and make people follow instructions. \n\n> He said I had way more power and then he called me a stupid little child. \n\nAnd he attacks others to shift the blame. Sweet.\n\nEDIT: new step-parents can be difficult. Especially if the father did not first see if everyone matched well together. But remarrying to get the new wife to care for the kids is a classic old-school strategy (that works quite well for the kids TBH).", "NTA. Problem with your brother: he simply will not listen to people that he considers beneath him. That goes for his kids and also for his much younger sister. But also for your parents. He also refuses to listen to them. That means that you cannot discuss anything with him. So why bother? Your brother is the problem here.", "NTA\n\nMick has the emotional comprehension of a biscuit, and it shows. The man needs therapy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis older kids have worked it out, and sounds like your parents are becoming aware too. Lets hope Jennifer and her kids make it out of there before he flips out on them too.", "NTA", "Your brother sounds like a prick in all honesty. \n\nHe didn't want the kids in a single parent house? More likely he wanted someone to look after them. He's shown no regard for what the kids might need and forced this new woman, a relative stranger, onto them while they are still grieving their mother.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a an AH, it was his job to help his kids transition through their mom\u2019s death, his dating , his remarriage and the birth of their half siblings.  \n\nIt\u2019s always been his responsibility and he clearly failed , trying to force a relationship instead of letting it grown naturally.", "NTA, absolutely.\n\nHe is a huge AH, I'd say the AH of the year.\n\nHe didn't give his kids time to grieve over the loss of their mom; he used the kids as an excuse to get remarried, never consulting their feelings. He tried to force them to love his new spouse and when that didn't work, he tried to force it even more. Same with the subsequent kids he had with her. And now that his kids are going LC/NC, instead of taking accountability, he tries to dump it on someone else - someone, moreover, whom he has always dismissed. \n\nKudos on your parents for kicking him out. You should go NC with him as well.", "NTA,\n\nI'm a year older than your brother, your brother is TA.. \n\nWhat he should of done is actually parented his 2 young kids and guided them through the trauma of losing their Mom at such young ages.. \n\nThere's way too much emphasis put on this aspect of \"Kids are resilient, kids will get over it or bounce back\" it's very far from the case.. and they can carry trauma into adulthood.. \n\nYour brother sees you as a kid because you're only 4 years older than your nephew.. so despite you and his kids adult ages, he is seeing kids.. \n\nI feel sorry though for their half siblings because your brother and his wife will be getting the kids hopes up in regards to big brother and sister.. only for their little hopes get crushed..", "I don't expect it to happen either.", "I really don't think they were having an affair. They met after Katie died but my brother was in the mindset of I need to find a way. But I think it was unhealthy the way he focused so much on the idea of giving them that second parent again that he forgot to focus on them and their needs.", "I think Jennifer and Mick's marriage is rocky but she's placing the blame on Con and Aoife. She doesn't know if she can have a healthy marriage with Mick when her kids are hurt by the fact Con and Aoife are no longer a part of their lives and after the whole making it clear they didn't want to see any of them, it's clear they might never.", "This here is yet again good example of a parent deciding, that what they want is best for their children and re-marry faster, than one can fart. Expecting the kids to go along with their little \"happy family\" delusion. Only to later wonder why doesn't the now adult kids want to have anything to do with said parent. Woe is me so to speak.\n\nTotally NTA. Not even close.  \nTo me it looks, that even biscuits have more emotional comprehension, than Mick.", "I don't think it was about getting someone else to look after them. Or not just them. He wanted to have someone there and I do think he wanted them to have a two parent family. But he failed to see and still fails to see, that even when he remarried it was still a one parent family in the emotional sense because the kids never accepted or regarded Jennifer as a parent or a member of their family. He had someone else there with him but his ultimate goal failed and I don't think it had to, if he had given it time and not focused on making it happen so much. \n\nHe put them into such a bad position and only grew more angry and frustrated as he saw things going the opposite of how he wanted them. But he never looked at himself and asked if he could be doing better. He just assumed they could be.", "I think the new wife got the short stick - it seems like she was selected for her potential mothering abilities, rather than as OP\u2019s brother\u2019s true love.", "He didn't want to give them a second parent: he was looking for someone to look after his kids. Basically a bang-nanny. I'm sorry for the poor kids.", "I\u2019d go so far as to say it probably felt like a zero parent family to the kids, since their dad seemed to care very little about how they felt or what they wanted/needed in this situation.", "That's not exactly what happened. I know that does happen a lot. But he was still involved. He just wanted someone else involved too. I really do believe that. It doesn't mean he went about it right. But it's not like he married again and dipped like so many people seem to when they marry/remarry when they have kids already. I can't defend him on much of it but I don't think he was just looking for someone to dump the kids on. I don't think he would have been as involved if that's all he cared about."]}
