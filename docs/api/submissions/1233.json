I don't usually cook so I make simple things when I'm hungry instead, but sometimes I enjoy cooking when i'm in the mood. I wouldn't be mad if I had to cook something for my whole family, but I'm more used to cook for myself since I know what I like, how to measure the portions and everyting. There are times where it's past 10 or 11 AM and nobody has made breakfast, so I assume the rest of my family is not hungry and I just cook something quick for myself. This makes my family furious and they call me ungrateful and a bad person. When I offer myself to make something for them, they sarcastically say they don't want anything anymore (side note, I'm autistic and i can't understand tones, so i don't really understand they're being sarcastic until they get mad at me) so I take it seriously and don't make anything, causing even more trouble. I don't do it to be bad, I just tend to cool my own food when I am starving and see no one making anything assuming nobody else is hungry, and I get lowkey overwhelmed when I have to cook for so many people since I have to worry about flavors people might not like, bother measurement and stuff, i'm not used to it. I have told them millions of times I am not doing it because I don't want to, it's just easier and more confortable for me, and if they don't show they're hungry, I have no way to know either.\n\nThe whole topic made me feel like a bit of an AH so I started thinking about cooking more for them, start learning new recipes and sharing it with then, but it all changed when 2 days ago I woke up one morning around 10 pm and realized my family was in the table, laughing at me when they saw me and saying they forgot to leave me breakfast. They ate all the food and left me nothing, they always threatened to do this, saying things like \"if you don't come here fast you'll have no food left\" but dang, I didn't think they would be capable of doing it. The worst part is that I didn't even know they were having breakfast, they called me and obviously didn't hear or respond because i was completely asleep. My mom just watched me while laughing and said \"well, too bad, there's cereal in the kitchen\".\n\nI got really pissed and sad since I always think about leaving food for a family member that hasn't eaten yet, even if i'm still not completely satisfied. They just forgot about me and ate everything, they didn't care about me. I have decided to completely shut down the idea of cooking for them and justkeep doing it for myself, if they don't care about me, why should I care about them?

If you are making something to eat, it's generally polite to ask others if they are hungry. It's not much harder to cook for several people than for one, you just add more of all the ingredients. You could also ask for help if others are hungry, but you're not sure how to make what everyone likes. However, they were rude too.", "I don't think you are the AH in this case. If you're making food for just yourself, you portion it out for just you. If you're making food for more than one person, you make enough for everyone who *might* want some. To exclude you from breakfast just to make a joke is horrible.", "This all seems to be about breakfast. Cold cooked breakfast is pretty nasty. Whatever you're cooking for breakfast, it's so much better hot and fresh. So I'd never keep breakfast for someone. But on the other hand, if I am cooking breakfast, I will automatically make breakfast for anyone that wants it, because the extra effort to make a bit more is minimal.\n\nWhy is all your family sitting around having breakfast at 10am (presumably you didn't mean 10pm) on a weekday? Do none of you have jobs or school or anything to get to?\n\nYTA", "I can tell by your comment that you don't cook.", "I cook almost every night for a family of 4.\n\nEdit: one of which is a teen boy who eats like a horse and the other is a very picky tween.", "Then why lie? Anyone that regularly cooks dinner for multiple people knows it's more than just adding some ingredients.", "Last night, my husband smoked a turkey. I made mashed potatoes, corn and gravy to go with it. The only extra work was cutting up a few extra potatoes. Extra time- maybe 5 minutes. \n\nThe night before that, I made pasta with a balsamic vinegar sauce. The only extra effort- cutting up a couple extra tomatoes and a couple extra chicken breasts. Again about 5 minutes. \n\nTonight, we're having chickpea curry and rice. The extra effort, cutting up a few extra tomatoes. Again an extra 5 minutes. \n\nAll the other stuff, the cooking times and effort are about the same. \n\nThere are meals where cooking for more people is significantly more work, but for most things, it's just some extra prep.", "Extra what? You aren't doing anything extra. Your suggestion was for one person to \"just add ingredients\" to make a meal for more people. Your extra is literally nothing where theirs is several people. If you had said I was making steak and then 4 people showed up so I just threw together extra ingredients and boom we were good, With no thought to time and effort; then that would have been a respectable comparison. What you said is nonsense. Seriously extra from what?"]}
