Your husband would rather risk your safety than have a man who is sexually harassing his wife lose his job. What an ass. This is how women get murdered everyday. People trying to dismiss a man's harassment is what makes women not listen to their instincts. Women are expected to be raped or murdered instead of a man facing repercussions for his behavior.", "The email didn\u2019t effect you?

When sending my email address to my friend to book for some reason it autocorrected to .com and I didn't realise until after it was booked and I got the confirmation to that email address. I didn't mean to use it for this booking and I legitimately hardly ever use it for anything else unless I need a second account on something.", "I think including he was the one I checked in with counts as a suspicion, it was fairly clear that it implicated him, as well as the fact I hadn't given my name or email address to any other employees (other than my friend) during my visit (they asked me that question and i answered honestly). I don't know why my husband thinks I went too far, I tried to stick only to the facts that I knew for certain, not any feelings or guesses."]}
