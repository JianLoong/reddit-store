Your husband would rather risk your safety than have a man who is sexually harassing his wife lose his job. What an ass. This is how women get murdered everyday.

You have him there with you, what if you were traveling alone?", "Exactly my thoughts, I'd rather the hotel be aware that this has been sent and can deal with it if it was sent by him, or investigate further if not.", "I don't want anyone to feel unsafe in this situation, I can't be certain whoever it is won't target others. I don't know why my husband doesn't see it but I'm just trying to keep people safe.", "I don't want to sound too casual about any of it because it definitely creeped me out, however I am trained in multiple martial arts and general self defense, I feel safe in most situations because I know how to get out of most bad physical altercations.

When sending my email address to my friend to book for some reason it autocorrected to .com and I didn't realise until after it was booked and I got the confirmation to that email address. I didn't mean to use it for this booking and I legitimately hardly ever use it for anything else unless I need a second account on something.", "I think including he was the one I checked in with counts as a suspicion, it was fairly clear that it implicated him, as well as the fact I hadn't given my name or email address to any other employees (other than my friend) during my visit (they asked me that question and i answered honestly). I don't know why my husband thinks I went too far, I tried to stick only to the facts that I knew for certain, not any feelings or guesses.", "NTA - Not reporting it if it is him would allow him to continue to use the personal data of other guests to be a perverted creep.\n\nGood for you.", "NTA If I were the hotel manager, I would want to know if one of my employees was sexually harassing my guests. Also what's wrong with your husband? Sending random obscene email to people isn't right, and if you do it you are signing your own pink slip.", "NTA \n\nThis person has access to keys to the rooms. And clearly has a poor sense of boundaries. You are traveling with someone else, but not everyone is.", "As someone who used to work in the hotel business, NTA. Management would much rather be aware of potential stalking situation by an employee.", "Your husband is an idiot at best and creepy at worst.  A male worker sending sexually harassing emails to woman staying at their workplace should be fired.\n\nNTA", "NTA - if he\u2019s doing so he SHOULD be fired so that\u2019s a great result.", "NTA  ... YWBTA if you did not report it.  He has or will do it to others and probably escalate.", "I think your husband needs a wake up call.\n\nIf it\u2019s not this employee, no harm no foul.  \nBUT if it is this employee, he needs to be dealt with so as no harm comes to anyone.  Think of it this way:\n\nHe knows you are there with your husband and daughter, yet still decided to send this email.  Why?  Has he done it before?  Has he pushed any other boundaries with any other women that are staying there?  What\u2019s his end game?  To meet up?  I don\u2019t think he would risk doing this if he wasn\u2019t after something from you.  The fact he feels confident enough to send this email is alarming.  What if he wants to meet or talk and you refuse, what then?  He just walks away?  After coming this far?  Remember you have your little girl with you.  Her safety, along with yours, is of the utmost importance.\n\nAgain, it may have not been him.  Or he may have sent it just to see what would happen.  He may not take it any further.  I wouldn\u2019t want to take that risk.\n\nYou are NTA.  I\u2019m leaning towards your husband being one though.", "NTA. If he has done this once, I guarantee he will do this again.\n\nAlso, you absolutely have a husband problem. You received a creepy, sexually harassing email through no-fault of you own, by someone who used a position of trust (having access to your information as a hotel employee) to do it. You likely feel gross and violated. This is basically stalking. \n\nThe fact your husband thinks \"this didn't effect you\" is not okay. Please share this response with him and ask why someone harassing and stalking you with privileged information is ever okay and why that shouldn't cost that person their job.", "NTA \n\nThat is totally unacceptable behavior for some rando to send you emails. And just because you are ok doesn\u2019t mean that the next person he does this to would be. Your husband caring more about some creepy dudes job rather than making sure you are not the target of someone\u2019s perverted fantasy is upsetting.", "NTA\n\nThis employee is finding out what happens when you get past fuck around.", "42 M. I\u2019m in the hotel industry. Have been for years. If the guy\u2019s innocent he has nothing to worry about. However if not\u2026you get the idea.\n\nPlease report him. Speaking for myself I would want to know if someone like this was on my staff. Plus your own security, and that of your child.", "NTA and I bet your husband would be singing a different tune if he was the one who got the pervy email!", "This sort of thing did happen to me. I believe it.", "Bet a dollar, he\u2019s done this before\u2026..", "Pretty easy for your husband to claim receiving a pervy email \"didn't effect you\"...", "Your husband, frankly, has never been a woman, especially one travelling alone. He never experienced it, so in his world, our experience doesn't really exist, even though he has now seen it. It never happened to him, and it was never threatening. He needs to start understanding, and he won't currently hear it from you. Tell him to ask his female friends about their experience with creeps, and to really listen. If he hears the same stories 20, 30, times, it may land.", "Or if whoever has been writing hasn't already done it before. \nYou don't know anything about this person. If they will only write. Or if they will continue writing. \nYou should be able to relax and feel safe. Not having to worry about if someone is creeping around. \n\nAn investigation will give a peace of mind. The hotel will know if this is a repeated offense.\nIf the person loses the job, it's their own doing.", "you are doing the right thing, especially for every single woman staying at that hotel. because who knows if he stops at sending emails, he has access to the hotel rooms. if i was travelling solo, i would not only report it, but check out immediately.", "Not disputing anything you said, but the simple fact is bad luck happens. A situation can occur where all things go sideways and any training that any person has (regardless of age or gender or anything) means absolutely nothing. A person could be in a struggle with someone and then slip on a carpet that hasn't been fitted properly. Report it. Ywbta if you don't.", "I suspect your husband sent the emails (perhaps as flirtation) and is embarrassed to admit it. Good job reporting weird activity.", "You've never had a man dismiss your lived experiences? Must be nice", "That's a weird, and slightly disturbing thought...", "Naw not a man that cares abt me nope. Definitely not a husband. And i cant see her husband not caring abt her\u2026 so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i dont see him dismissing something as egregious as this", "I don't think he did. I think he just doesn't fully grasp the situation.", "I still don\u2019t believe you.", "That's fine, just thought I'd give some missing context that I'd didn't put in the post."]}
