A guy with access to people in a hotel, maybe lots of single younger women as well and feels it's okay to use private data for personal use and that personal use is to be creepy and sexual towards customers at the hotel?\n\nThe real question here is how and why your husband feels the need to protect this creep rather than protect you and other women he's targeting and putting at risk?", "NTA\n\nAnd if he did it, he should be fired and if not, they investigate and maybe find who really did.", "NTA. You were correct to report this. They're not going to fire someone just because you make the issue known. If their employee IS doing this, it needs to be known and addressed. If it wasn't their employee, it's good the hotel is alerted to a potential problem. \n\nMy first thought was that this is step one of a stalking. You don't know if this is going to escalate. And you don't know if this person is just targeting you or other women. So your husband's assertion that you weren't impacted is premature. \n\nBut the fact that your husband said that...is it possible that he sent you the email?", "NTA, if he did it he deserves to be fired.", "Advise your husband that this man could actually physically harm you.

This would be absolutely terrifying to me, even with my partner there. It sounds like you're pretty sure about reporting but just in case you're still hesitating, imagine this. You don't say something, he does it to someone else who is vulnerable and she has something bad happen to her. Letting creeps get away with \"small\" shit allows them to escalate. Shame on your husband for his reaction. Some creep sends his wife a message on her personal email that he got from his job and he's worried about the creep? I'm appalled.", "NTA. Why is your husband wanting to protect the livelihood of a creep and potential predator?", "NTA. It's like a peeping tom. They start out looking in windows and then escalate too worse.

(On that note: ickkkkkkkk people sick.)\n\n>I'm more concerned about people without that which would definitely feel unsafe if they got this message.\n\nAs a woman who often travels alone, I would absolutely feel unsafe. I would worry that he might have accessed my room when I'm not there, or worse that he might try and enter my room at night when I *am* there.\n\n The simple fact that he went through work records to find my email, has been paying attention to me, and thought sending me sexually explicit messages was acceptable would make me fear the multitude of other ways he might choose to cross the line. \n\nSo yeah.
