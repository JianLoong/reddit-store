Think of it this way:\n\nHe knows you are there with your husband and daughter, yet still decided to send this email.  Why?  Has he done it before?  Has he pushed any other boundaries with any other women that are staying there?  What\u2019s his end game?  To meet up?  I don\u2019t think he would risk doing this if he wasn\u2019t after something from you.  The fact he feels confident enough to send this email is alarming.  What if he wants to meet or talk and you refuse, what then?  He just walks away?  After coming this far?  Remember you have your little girl with you.  Her safety, along with yours, is of the utmost importance.\n\nAgain, it may have not been him.  Or he may have sent it just to see what would happen.  He may not take it any further.

You likely feel gross and violated. This is basically stalking. \n\nThe fact your husband thinks \"this didn't effect you\" is not okay. Please share this response with him and ask why someone harassing and stalking you with privileged information is ever okay and why that shouldn't cost that person their job.", "NTA \n\nThat is totally unacceptable behavior for some rando to send you emails.

A situation can occur where all things go sideways and any training that any person has (regardless of age or gender or anything) means absolutely nothing.

He has no clue.  (Read in a southern drawl)\n\nIt's a huge pet peeve of mine when men don't understand or try to understand life as a woman. They've never walked to the car with keys between your fingers like Wolverine just in case.  Just had this discussion with an older man who insisted that he was just as vulnerable as any woman.
