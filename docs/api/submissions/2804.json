And her response to you is utterly typical teenager. You are NTA.", "NTA. Teaching someone to thinking before they speak is a dying art. Thanks for keeping it alive.", "NTA. You are trying to teach your daughter tact.  And, even if the friend didn't seem bothered, it was still not the way to ask.", "NTA. Divorces are hard on kids. Nobody knows the consequences of a throwaway comment. It\u2019s your job to make sure your kids are socially adept. It\u2019s clear that your daughter hasn\u2019t grasped the potential hurt she could have caused though, so maybe another calm, kind discussion about other people\u2019s feelings is required.", "NTA, OP. She deserves the lecturing. She'll appreciate it when she gets older. Divorce hard on kids already, with the thought of whether they divorce because of you or if they don't want to be with you anymore. Everytime someone ask something like that behind the facade of \"being honest and a simple person\" could hurt. Your daughter needs to learn to be tactful and more emphatic when she ask questions regarding her friend.", "NTA\n\nThe better lesson might be in empathy and expressing their feelings rather than the blunt, tactless approach. Your daughter is 13 and approached it without tact. Lucky for her, it worked out.\n\nNext time she might not be so lucky. She just needs to learn how to connect with people emotionally and still ask questions because she cares. That starts from watching you and how you model this behavior at home.\n\nJust a lesson learned at this point but a good one that\u2019ll follow life.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to understand that just because Jocelene didn't care doesn't mean it was appropriate. The next person she talks to like this might get really upset. \n\nGoing forward, this could cost her friends, jobs, and opportunities. It's best she learns that what she did isn't okay, now, before it causes issues later.", "NTA..you are trying to teach your daughter how to be tactful and know when and where questions should be asked. This is a good time to sit her down with a dictionary and show her the words tact, compassion, and empathy and ask if that was what she showed her friend. Whether she didn't seem to mind is not the issue. She may be really good about not showing emotions..I know I still am 50yrs after my parents divorce.", "NTA. Your daughter\u2019s friend may not have picked up on how offensive your daughter\u2019s wording was, or may have pretended not to care, but what she said was offensive and rude. Good on you for taking the opportunity to teach her better. If she doesn\u2019t learn tact now she\u2019ll get herself into trouble later in life.", "NTA.  Good on you mom for speaking with your daughter about being more respectful.  Maybe Jocelene didn't care about respect but someone at some point might.  If she learns this lesson earlier in life it may spare her a lot of grief later on.", "Nah. 13 year olds make friends fast... And it's a genuine question... Why did the dad move to another country abandoning his child. For all you know Jocelene may have actually liked the question because it's a question she herself really wants the answer to... And to hear it from someone else the same age as her... Validated her feelings. Who knows.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong by speaking to her about how such a line of questioning could be interpreted poorly... In fact it was great that you did...But maybe a discussion was in order rather than a stern one way lecture, especially if the outcome you were looking for was tactfulness  and empathy.", "NTA\n\nIt didn\u2019t cause an issue this time, but if she continues to believe it is ok to make insensitive and tacky remarks to people, someone\u2019s feelings are bound to be hurt soon enough.", "This really depends on how you \"heavily lectured\" her.  Obviously NTA for talking to her about it.  She's probably just being defensive.  But we don't know if you just explained it to her or like belittled and shamed her for handling it how she did.  They way you're using words like \"heavy,\" \"stern,\" and \"lecture\" makes me worried that perhaps you are being a bit of an AH too.  I'd go for more of a conversational, informative vibe rather than a \"stern lecture\" vibe.", "Nta this is bullying. And kid used to being bullied learns to hide their feelings. Your daughters IS checking if you ok with her being a Bully. Guess her Friends laughed too so nothing Bad, just a joke.", "I'm having difficulty imaging the conversation between you and Joanna with her quoting herself if she didn't think she had thought the conversation went fine.", "NTA. And Miss Joana probably doesn\u2019t need her phone for a few days.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. Your intentions were good but I think you approached it too sternly. \n\nThese questions are frequently asked by children and adults (My parents divorced when I was in K-12). You could have explained that her approach was a tad invasive and that she could have re-framed her question into one that asks for permission. Such as:\n\n\"May I ask...?\"\n\nAgain, NTA but I do think you overreacted by being too stern. Have a frank discussion by expressing your concern but avoid turning these conversations one that is stem/punishing towards your daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A \"Hersh lecture\" wasn't the way to go. \nShe didn't insult anyone, she was just tactless. \nYes, definitely talk to her how we should approach sensitive topics, how to not corner people, how not to assume on other situations and so on. \nBut treat her as a teenager that can understand, not as a little kid.", "NTA"]}
