Nobody knows the consequences of a throwaway comment. It\u2019s your job to make sure your kids are socially adept. It\u2019s clear that your daughter hasn\u2019t grasped the potential hurt she could have caused though, so maybe another calm, kind discussion about other people\u2019s feelings is required.", "NTA, OP. She deserves the lecturing. She'll appreciate it when she gets older. Divorce hard on kids already, with the thought of whether they divorce because of you or if they don't want to be with you anymore.

Your daughter needs to learn to be tactful and more emphatic when she ask questions regarding her friend.", "NTA\n\nThe better lesson might be in empathy and expressing their feelings rather than the blunt, tactless approach. Your daughter is 13 and approached it without tact. Lucky for her, it worked out.\n\nNext time she might not be so lucky. She just needs to learn how to connect with people emotionally and still ask questions because she cares. That starts from watching you and how you model this behavior at home.\n\nJust a lesson learned at this point but a good one that\u2019ll follow life.", "NTA.

This is a good time to sit her down with a dictionary and show her the words tact, compassion, and empathy and ask if that was what she showed her friend.

Your daughter\u2019s friend may not have picked up on how offensive your daughter\u2019s wording was, or may have pretended not to care, but what she said was offensive and rude.

If she learns this lesson earlier in life it may spare her a lot of grief later on.", "Nah. 13 year olds make friends fast... And it's a genuine question... Why did the dad move to another country abandoning his child. For all you know Jocelene may have actually liked the question because it's a question she herself really wants the answer to... And to hear it from someone else the same age as her... Validated her feelings. Who knows.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong by speaking to her about how such a line of questioning could be interpreted poorly... In fact it was great that you did...But maybe a discussion was in order rather than a stern one way lecture, especially if the outcome you were looking for was tactfulness  and empathy.", "NTA\n\nIt didn\u2019t cause an issue this time, but if she continues to believe it is ok to make insensitive and tacky remarks to people, someone\u2019s feelings are bound to be hurt soon enough.", "This really depends on how you \"heavily lectured\" her.  Obviously NTA for talking to her about it.  She's probably just being defensive.  But we don't know if you just explained it to her or like belittled and shamed her for handling it how she did.  They way you're using words like \"heavy,\" \"stern,\" and \"lecture\" makes me worried that perhaps you are being a bit of an AH too.  I'd go for more of a conversational, informative vibe rather than a \"stern lecture\" vibe.", "Nta this is bullying. And kid used to being bullied learns to hide their feelings.

Your intentions were good but I think you approached it too sternly. \n\nThese questions are frequently asked by children and adults (My parents divorced when I was in K-12). You could have explained that her approach was a tad invasive and that she could have re-framed her question into one that asks for permission. Such as:\n\n\"May I ask...?\"\n\nAgain, NTA but I do think you overreacted by being too stern.

There's something called tact and the sooner your daughter learns it, the better.", "Is Joana neurodivergent?", "NTA, your daughter needs this to learn to think before she speaks and not everything is appropriate to say.

A \"Hersh lecture\" wasn't the way to go. \nShe didn't insult anyone, she was just tactless. \nYes, definitely talk to her how we should approach sensitive topics, how to not corner people, how not to assume on other situations and so on. \nBut treat her as a teenager that can understand, not as a little kid.", "NTA", "NTA, what a bizarre way for her to say that.

While normally you would be right to teach her to think before she speaks, and speak with empathy, it's not clear that she failed to do that.  The time they have known each other may have been short, but the lack of negative reaction from Jocelene may indicate that your daughter had a better \"read\" of the situation than you did and asked a question that was appropriate at their level of friendship and her level of comfort.\n\nCorrect your daughter when a problem is presented, right now you are trying to fix something that isn't broken so of course she's not going to see how she might be wrong when all you have to argue with is \"But she could have taken your words like this and been so upset!\".\n\nI'm not just saying this as an outside observer.  My dad died of cancer when I was 5.  I can not tell you how many times \"uncomfortable\" questions came up about why my father wasn't present over the years.  I put that in quotes because for me, it wasn't that uncomfortable after the first year or two, it just was the way things were, but for the person asking it never stopped being uncomfortable.  \n\nWhen I was 10 this lady came by door to door selling chocolate, probably for her kid's school or troop or whatever but my mom was a big health nut at the time and I told her my mom doesn't like chocolate and only allows us to have it around the holidays. She replies \"I'm sure your dad likes to eat chocolate, can I talk to him?\" and my best friend was standing next to me and said \"His dad doesn't eat anything, much less chocolate.\" She wasn't too quick on the uptake, and in her defense I'm sure it's not a common situation, but she persisted in her sales pitch and said \"I'm sure he likes some kind of candy, can I talk to him?\" and William was already laughing before I responded with \"If you can talk to the dead I'd like to learn how too.\" I'll never forget the look on her face as she mumbled an apology and speed-walked back to her car.  She didn't bother stopping at any more houses on my street.\n\nI'm explaining all that to leave you with this:  William remained my best friend for another 10 years until we lost touch because I moved more than a thousand miles away and this was pre-internet. But I was never upset with him about his questions about my father or how he presented the situation to other people.  Jocelene might have found a kindred spirit in your daughter like I had with William. So while under normal circumstances you might be right, in this case, you might be a woman selling chocolate.", "NTA, and just cause the girl didn't look hurt doesn't mean she wasn't.

Even if the friend did not appear to mind, IMO she is likely to be hurt by that question.  She may never have had her circumstances put to her in that stark and painful way.", "NTA if you just explained m that that may not be acceptable on some cases. I dont think it calls for punishment since her new friend took it okay, but it diesnt sound like you did punish her, so NTA. \n\nAnd her being 13, her reaction might be from embarrassment as much as anything else. It can be hard to be genuine about having been wrong at that age. I wouldnt push this any more unless she does something like this again.", "NTA. You\u2019re right her question was rude. And she DOESNT know that her friend was okay with it. All she knows is her friend handled it well to her face.\n\nThat comment probably did hurt her.", "NTA. This time her friend didn\u2019t seem to mind the questions. The next person she is so tactless with might not be so calm about it.", "NTA your daughter was rude. For all we know there\u2019s a visa issue or family issue.", "NTA. That was mortifyingly rude. I'd be so ashamed", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH.

Should she have worded it better? Yes. However, at 13, I also said a lot of things in ways I didn\u2019t mean because my brain just told me \u201csay it\u201d and how could my brain be wrong? So I get her impulsiveness", "The only thing I see here is: instead of speaking sternly just explaining why her question could be upsetting to someone.  I don\u2019t think lecturing her accomplished anything but setting her back up. But I\u2019m not voting - I just think your heart was in the right place, just mishandle a13 yr old who might be feeling uncomfortable now.", "NTA actually quite the opposite! It is super important to teach kids what is appropriate to say and what isn't. If you had been screaming at her or anything like that it would be different but when a child does something rude they obviously either didn't understand that it was rude or they are becoming a rude person and it's on parents to nip that right in the bud and try to help their kids become kind an compassionate adults.", "Soft NAH.\n\nYour daughter lacks tact...but she's also like 13 so it's very on-brand of her to be rude without realising it and to rebuff your attempts to help her practice empathy. That doesn't make her a bad person; that just makes her a typical teenager.\n\nLikewise, you're not being mean or unfair; you're just being a typical parent, caught off-guard by how your teen can without realising it be insensitive.\n\nYou weren't wrong for your approach at all either, and it was quite generous of you to even take your daughter at her word that Jocelene wasn't affected by the questioning. My advice would be (if you do talk again to her later) to ask her to think of your suggestion more broadly, because not everyone is going to react like Jocelene (again, taking her at her word) and be chill and unaffected by such an abrupt choice of words - and ask her what she's going to do if someone meets her questions with criticism (framing tact to her as something she can use to protect herself instead of as a form of self-policing) or point out how what she's saying is making them feel poorly about themselves?", "NTA, you're absolutely right and your daughter really needs to learn to not inadvertently or purposefully insult someone or their family.", "People don't always publicly show or complain when they're bothered by something. Just because the girl didn't act upset doesn't mean she wasn't. There is no excuse for that kind of rude behaviour. NTA.", "Also, I'm somewhat dubious of Joana's claim Jocelene *wasn't* at least a little affected by the question.", "My thoughts exactly", "She's 13. She doesn't know what's appropriate yet (and I say this as a woman who took her niece out for her 13th birthday literally yesterday to get her first bottle of perfume), and it's your job to teach her. \n\nStay strong! Good for you on checking your gut instinct --that's a great feature in a mom, one who is willing to consider that she's wrong--but yes, you are right. \n\nHowever, lecture format may not have been optimal. You could have gone with a \"I know she wasn't offended, but people are typically very sensitive about their families, and it's a good practice to be gentle when asking family questions, if you ask them at all.\"", "NTA. If your kid was 5, the questions (and the blunt wording of them) could be forgiven, with a gentle explanation about families being different. Kids just entering school *usually* have to learn about different family trees. \n\nMaybe, *maybe*, this was innocent. This does in fact justify a conversation about being tactful and delicate around topics that could be sensitive. If you hurt someone by being careless, they're still hurt. It might be easier to mend than a deliberate hurt, but it still requires fixing. \n\nHowever, my instinct says that she's deflecting because she was trying to bully this other kid. And by instinct, I do mean my own history as a target of bullying and harassment, from the playground to the workplace. I fully admit my own history is shaping my perception here, but I don't think I'm wrong. This type of bullying is easily disguised as 'curiosity' or 'just making conversation', if caught or questioned.\n\nI think she's feeling guilty because she knows what she did could be hurtful (as that was the intent), and is trying to shift blame for that feeling onto you (you lectured, she feels bad) rather than her actions (she did something hurtful, she feels bad).", "NTA. Parents are supposed to guide their kids just like you did! If you don\u2019t, how else will they learn and develop a verbal filter?"]}
