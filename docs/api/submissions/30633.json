My wife wanted an abortion but I begged her to keep the baby because I always wanted a daughter. She on the other hand never wanted a 3rd child or a daughter and she only accepted to give birth with one condition, I'll do most of the parenting, and I agreed.\n\nDuring the past 16 years my wife has always been cold to Sophia. They just never bonded the way she bonded with our boys.\n\nLast week it was Sophia's 16th birthday. All she wanted to do was to spend the day with her family and we agreed however on the day of her birthday Jared got the flu and couldn't come. This wasn't the problem for Sophia because she was never close to Jared so it didn't matter if he didn't come however my wife informed us that she is planning to stay home with Jared and look after him. I told her Jared is a grown man and his sickness is not so bad. He doesn't need his mom with him but my wife was determined to stay with him.\n\nEvan and I took Sophia out to her favorite restaurant but she was quiet the entire time and finally just started crying and said we should just go back home. Evan and I were PISSED at my wife and Jared(who was the one who asked my wife to stay with him) so we decided to cheer her up by buying her favorite car for her.\n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. The only money I had was the money we have saved for a trip for me and my wife. My wife was looking forward to this trip and we were going there in 2 days. I spent all of the money on a car for Sophia and she looked so happy.\n\nMy wife however wasn't happy when she heard what I did. She called me an asshole and said she was looking forward to this trip. I told her we couldn't go anyway because Jared is sick and she can't leave him alone remember? She just screamed at me and called me names and went to our room", "created_utc": 1699525877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ra31e/aita_for_spending_our_trip_money_on_a_car_for_my/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's a massive age gap as well - your wife probably thought her days of changing nappies / diapers and doing night time feeds were over, not to mention going through pregnancy and birth all over again.\n\nAnd when the child does appear, it's highly likely that the spouse will resent the child for the new level of commitment that is expected, especially if the time was approaching where the existing children would be getting old enough to not need constant attention and also being able to be left alone so you could go out to dinner or whatever.\n\nI've no doubt you thought your jibe about your wife not being able to go anyway was a great comeback, but unfortunately it would have been more suitable for missing something an awful lot less expensive than a holiday.\n\nI don't think your wife's behaviour is admirable, but you wanted a child against your wife's will and this is where you are.

I don't know why you expected your wife to be a loving mother to Sophia. You knew she never wanted her, so it shouldn't be a surprise that she'd refuse to be there on Sophia's birthday.

You set your daughter up for a lifetime of feeling unloved by her own mother. And that kind of life leaves serious scars. And then you blew all that money on a car. You did it to hurt your wife; it wasn't just for Sophia. You knew exactly what you were doing. You and your wife are both selfish assholes and you both suck as spouses and parents.

Thank god she has one decent parent. However... YTA for staying with a woman who so obviously hates her own daughter. You really need to put her #1 and leave your wife.

You should have discussed this with your wife and even if y\u2019all disagreed at least it would have been discussed. That wasn\u2019t a team player move. However, your wife is not being a team player. She needs therapy with her daughter. Their lack of a relationship is absolutely heart breaking and I can only imagine how it will hurt your daughter in the long run. That kind of emotional neglect from her own mother is deeply traumatizing and will lead to your daughter struggling with anti social defense mechanisms.

Wow, you picked a terrible woman to have kids with.", "OK, yes YTA for spending the trip money  on a car. Thats what you asked for judgment on, so for that yes.\n\nBut really E S H.

Instead of acting like its the daughters fault. The mom is still the biggest c*** here for hating her own child.", "Holy mother of assumptions batman.", "She looks like she could be my twin.

Not sure the wife is the mother.", "I'm willing to bet Sophia approves of her father's actions.", "I also want to know how/when they found out the gender while debating an abortion. Did OP have his wife get a NIPT test and say \"if it's a girl, keep it\"?", "Might be a road trip. We did that without booking any hotels, just a general idea where to go and than drive and stop were we wanted to stay \ud83e\udd37", "up until this day, i have never expected to hear the whole concept of \"yeah she's our unplanned daughter, so my husband takes care of her while i can be a dick\"\n\nyet here we are. sad time.", "She never wanted her.", "If only there was a way for a woman to end a pregnancy . Oh, hang on - she wanted an abortion, but her husband persuaded her otherwise. So...", "Yes!", "The assumption was that there is something deeply wrong going on there, and an important piece of the puzzle is missing.

There is zero reason to treat your child with hatred and disdain for her whole life, no matter how unwanted they are.", "OP's daughter is alive today, and - no matter what the mother is - she has a loving father. You are saying it would be somehow better for her if she was \"terminated\" in the womb?", "If only there was a way for women to take responsibility to not get pregnant in the first place... Oh wait murder is always the best option. And in a MARRIAGE it's not just what she wants.", "I suspect your a bit slow on your reading skills but just to clarify it to u again OP clearly said he begged her to keep the baby and agreed to take care of her\nYou don't know how much gaslighting and manipulation he put forward a woman who is going through pregnancy. OP is the one at fault, when she didn't want to have a baby he shouldn't have forced her. They both agreed that OP will take care of the baby, but OP got mad that they are following this agreement so he used up the money he saved up for a trip to buy a car for the problem he caused. \nI agree the mother shouldn't be ice cold to her daughter, but what else did op expect when she didn't even want the baby.\nEdit: English isn't my first language"]}
