My partner does not work from home and finishes work around an hour after me and takes 30 mins to get home. This means I have 90 mins to myself after work but I also do all of the cooking so around 30 mins of that is just me cooking. On weekends I pretty much spend all my time with my partner if neither of us have other plans and I was starting to feel burnt out and just needed some time to myself to relax and watch tv shows my partner isn't interested in, play video games etc. \n\n  \nI decided the easiest way to do this would be to stay up later than my partner a couple of times a week. When I mentioned this to her she seemed a bit annoyed but I just explained that I just need a bit more time to myself and this seemed like the best way since it doesn't take away from the time we're spending together. The first night I did it things seemed fine and then the next night I had planned to do it, my gf said she wasn't feeling tired so had decided to stay up. I told her that's fine but I'm still planning on watching tv and just chilling out so asked if she could be quiet and not keep interrupting the tv. She said that's fine and then proceeded to play videos out loud, talk to me and repeatedly try to show me things. \n\n  \nI tried talking to her about it and explained again that she knows I wanted this time to just relax and it's seeming like she's deliberately stopping me doing that. She said she wasn't and just repeated that she wasn't tired. I decided to just go to sleep and she came straight to bed with me. The next time I told her I was staying up a bit she did it again and I got annoyed. I told her that she's deliberately ruining my time to myself and if she wants to stay up, she can do it without talking to me and interrupting my time to myself.\n\n  \nShe just said I was getting angry over nothing and that I can't tell her to go to bed/not stay up when it's her apartment aswell but she wouldn't listen when I tried explaining that's not what I was doing.  \nShe just said I was being unreasonable since I was deliberately trying to get away from her and that her being around shouldn't annoy me/make me angry.

She said she wasn\u2019t and just repeated she wasn\u2019t tired.  \n\nThis right here is the crux of the matter.  You have used your words to discuss this, and she\u2019s blowing you off.  You\u2019re trying to do something and she\u2019s talking to you and showing you things you\u2019re not interested in on her phone. \n\nJust because she\u2019s \u2018not tired\u2019 suddenly either past your usual bedtimes, doesn\u2019t mean you need to continue to be her audience.   \n\nIs she one of those that is incapable of not thinking every thought, narrates her own life, needs people to not ever be doing things that don\u2019t involve her?", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with needing alone time in a relationship and you are clearly doing your best to communicate and she's ignoring you. \n\nIdk if you need the validation after all these asinine comments, but yeah the fact that you need time to yourself doesn't mean you don't like or love your girlfriend. It's totally healthy and normal to want to spend time along, and I don't think you need to make any sacrifices here such as compromising on a show. From the sounds of it you spend plenty of time together, and this is something you want to do for yourself outside of that", "You asked, \"am i the ahole for staying up later than usual? Wanting to stay up late on my own?\". To those questions, the answer is, NTA. But let me dig in a little more. \n\nI don't think that it's so much that you're trying to get AWAY from her. It's perfectly understandable and healthy that you need some alone time. Everyone does sometimes. Including, and especially, in relationships. And I think, really, what's upsetting you is that you've expressed a need and a boundary, and she doesn't seem to be hearing you/respecting it (chatting through your show even after you say something, etc); which probably feels extra frustrating since you've gone out of your way to make it during a time that you guys aren't/don't normally spend together. \n\nThat being said, she has every right to stay up late, like you do. And maybe, if this arrangement isn't working out, you can try a different way to get your alone time. I think a conversation, when you guys are less emotionally charged, about your needs that you need met, should happen. Because it sounds like there's some things on her end, prompting her to continually stay up late with you when she normally wouldn't be staying up. Maybe she has some needs, too, that she feels need to be met, that she just hasn't expressed?", "NTA. \n\nI used to live with a couple where the gf always did this and it was so fkn annoying even just to witness. Like, let a dude breathe man. Adults should not need to be babied 24/7. \nIt got to the point where he used to go into bed, wait for her to go to sleep and then sneak out and watch anime with me lol it was so hilarious but also sad.\n\nI'm also a person who needs a lot of time to myself and I ended up marrying a guy who was very much the same. So it may be a kind of incompatibility thing.\n\nEither way it's something you need to sort out between yourselves because that's one of those habits that's gonna build a lot of resentment if it keeps on going.", "Oh the gaslighting \n\nNTA \n\nShe is deliberately doing it.  She seems to think she has a right to every second of your free time.....either that or she suspects you're cheating", "I think it's either NTA or NAH, needs more info for this. How long are you in relationship? Was it always like this, that you spend next to 100% of your time together? Does she have friends? \n\nIt's quite possible you've been lovebirds for long enough for her to forget how to be on her own and now she feels like you are rejecting her, or that she is not enough if you need something else to do and spend time without her. My guess is that her reaction comes from a place of insecurity. Maybe try talking to her more? Like ask her to sit down and listen to your reasoning, not just a few phrases over dinner, but make it a separate conversation. Explain that you love her and love spending time with her, and with that you also love your own things, and don't want her to feel left out just because you need some \"me\" time, people are different. You could tell her later what you watched/learned in your alone time, and it could become another conversation topic. And yeah OP, it's time for you to claim some of the weekend time for yourself, and preferably outside the house, because if you don't start it now, later it will be harder, as there will be also an argument of \"but you liked spending all the time together just fine for all these years\".", "This is a weird one because why does she not want you to be alone but also why are you so mad at her for wanting to spend time with you", "You guys should talk like adults.

Or lock her in a room cause you want your free time. \nUse those 90 minutes for yourself and start the cooking once she is home so you can cook together.

My partner and I are both introverts and need alone time to recharge but this is something we\u2019ve both known about each other from the outset of our relationship. If it wasn\u2019t and he came to me after 3 years of always spending free time together I\u2019d start to inwardly panic and reflect on what about me has necessitated the change. It\u2019s not always rational but girls internalise things and look inward when things like this happen, even if it\u2019s not remotely about them. Potentially your approach could have been softer. Talk to her and see how your request made her feel and help allay any insecurity she\u2019s feeling. Often times, that\u2019s all we need to feel better about something", "You shouldn't need to stay up late just to get some time to yourself - you're a childless, youngish couple (I assume) who lives together...you don't need to spend every free moment breathing in each others' carbon dioxide.\n\nWhen you live in a smallish place, it's harder to do your own thing (be that watch a movie, play games, whatever) so both people need to respect each other's space a bit, especially when it's been communicated clearly. You're not telling her to *get out*, just to...do her own thing for a little while and not interject.\n\nIt's probably just an introvert/extrovert thing. You're not TA, some people need some time to do their own thing and not interact non-stop.", "I don't know your GF, obv, so I don't know anything but what you've mentioned. But is it possible she's worried you're staying up to talk to some other girl or something (I'm not saying you are, just that the idea might be in her head)? Is she insecure or jealous as a rule?\n\nThis may be completely irrelevant, but I thought it might be worth mentioning just in case. \n\nEither way, you're NTA, unless you're leaving out something huge. \n\nPeople need alone time. Different people need different amounts but everyone needs SOME. We just don't all realise that, especially if (e.g.) we have some mental health stuff that is making it uncomfortable to be alone with our thoughts. But that's something separate that would need addressing if it were the case for her. It doesn't sound like that's it, though.  \n\nMaybe she can't sleep when you aren't next to her and doesn't know what to do about it apart from stay up until you come to bed too? It doesn't excuse her not giving you what you need, but it isn't necessarily malicious.  A lot of people in couples find that they get used to their partner's presence and come to depend on things like hearing them breathe in order to drift off.  \n\nI think a serious chat is in order, and if she can't be receptive to your needs, you need to work together to figure out why that is and how to repair it, or rethink the relationship if your respective needs are ultimately incompatible.", "Until his girl pops out of his suitcase.", "You are indeed deliberately trying to get away from her.", "10/10", "Sometimes it really seems like AITA is full of teenagers who have never been in an adult relationship.

She clearly does not want him to spend time alone.\n\nI do agree that talking about is necessary but I think the most likely explanation is that she is the type of person that wants to spend as much time with their partner so when he says he wants alone time she doesn't understand it and instead feels that him spending time without her is their relationship deteriorating. So she forces them to spend time together.\n\nWhile I may be off on the details of her motivation, I am fairly certain that the underlying issue is that she either doesn't understand or is not willing to accept the fact that he needs time alone.", "Good take, and a good follow-up question.", "We've been together around 3 years", "Because he specifically requested more time and alone and she won\u2019t leave him alone", "Because I should be allowed time to myself", "Sometimes I swear men can do no right in a relationship.

He clearly communicated his needs already?", "You guys should talk like adults.", "I agree she sounds like the type of person in a relationship, that needs a lot of time together; whereas OP needs that solitude sometimes.

But you don\u2019t get to just ban your partner from whatever room you\u2019re in because you want \u201calone time\u201d.  \n\nYou have 90 minutes of alone time every day.  Wait for your gf to get home and cook dinner together.", "I meannnn sure but when you live with someone you can't dictate where they are in their own home. My parents are married and live together but I've never once heard either of them kick each other out of a room or say \"I don't want you around me\" Maybe the issue is one of long term compatibility and a deeper discussion about how you guys need things to work for you to successfully live together needs to happen. What is making you feel like you need that time away from her?", "**Can they not watch TV together and he picks the show? What about that annoys him?**", "Your last point is just incorrect.

Everything she stays up to do can be done in another room anyway.\n\nDo you not think I should be able to stay up for some time to myself?", "Why not? Adults sharing a living space should be able to make compromises and arrangements like that. Me and my husband each claim the living room for 4 hours once a week for our DND games. I have asked my husband not to come in the kitchen while I cook (it's small) and he is fine with that and just let's me know if he needs something. My husband NEVER enters the bathroom when I shower, lest all the steam escape. It's really not that unusual in a shared space to compromise about who is using what when...though using emotionally charged words like \"banned\" certainly makes it sound less reasonable and normal", "Again its time to myself, not away from my girlfriend specifically so stop twisting what I'm saying. \n\nYou can't seem to answer why you think you're not supposed to have any time to yourself if you're in a relationship", "PC mostly.

I'm asking why it has to be so deliberate. Why did you go out of your way to tell her you wanted to stay up later without her? It would hurt my feelings if my partner went out of their way to avoid me in the home and exclude me from activities. As I've already said though, her behavior is strange to me as well, if my partner put on a movie after I went to bed, I would just stay in bed.", "Really? Wow that's so weird haha I grew up around PC gamers and they're all the *most* touchy when it comes to interrupting game time haha.", "i don't think that's reasonable either I'm just wondering if maybe the way he presented it hurt his girlfriend's feelings so now she's being passive aggressive in response.

If he got up after I went to bed to game with the boys, that wouldn't hurt me. If he said \"can you turn your phone down so I can watch my movie\" that wouldn't hurt me. However, if he went out of his way to tell me he didn't want me around him in the home we live in together after being apart all day at work and having an hour and a half on top of that to himself, yeah that would sting a little bit.
