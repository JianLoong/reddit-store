The first night I did it things seemed fine and then the next night I had planned to do it, my gf said she wasn't feeling tired so had decided to stay up. I told her that's fine but I'm still planning on watching tv and just chilling out so asked if she could be quiet and not keep interrupting the tv. She said that's fine and then proceeded to play videos out loud, talk to me and repeatedly try to show me things. \n\n  \nI tried talking to her about it and explained again that she knows I wanted this time to just relax and it's seeming like she's deliberately stopping me doing that. She said she wasn't and just repeated that she wasn't tired. I decided to just go to sleep and she came straight to bed with me. The next time I told her I was staying up a bit she did it again and I got annoyed.

She said she wasn\u2019t and just repeated she wasn\u2019t tired.  \n\nThis right here is the crux of the matter.  You have used your words to discuss this, and she\u2019s blowing you off.  You\u2019re trying to do something and she\u2019s talking to you and showing you things you\u2019re not interested in on her phone. \n\nJust because she\u2019s \u2018not tired\u2019 suddenly either past your usual bedtimes, doesn\u2019t mean you need to continue to be her audience.   \n\nIs she one of those that is incapable of not thinking every thought, narrates her own life, needs people to not ever be doing things that don\u2019t involve her?", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with needing alone time in a relationship and you are clearly doing your best to communicate and she's ignoring you. \n\nIdk if you need the validation after all these asinine comments, but yeah the fact that you need time to yourself doesn't mean you don't like or love your girlfriend. It's totally healthy and normal to want to spend time along, and I don't think you need to make any sacrifices here such as compromising on a show. From the sounds of it you spend plenty of time together, and this is something you want to do for yourself outside of that", "You asked, \"am i the ahole for staying up later than usual? Wanting to stay up late on my own?\". To those questions, the answer is, NTA. But let me dig in a little more. \n\nI don't think that it's so much that you're trying to get AWAY from her. It's perfectly understandable and healthy that you need some alone time. Everyone does sometimes. Including, and especially, in relationships. And I think, really, what's upsetting you is that you've expressed a need and a boundary, and she doesn't seem to be hearing you/respecting it (chatting through your show even after you say something, etc); which probably feels extra frustrating since you've gone out of your way to make it during a time that you guys aren't/don't normally spend together. \n\nThat being said, she has every right to stay up late, like you do. And maybe, if this arrangement isn't working out, you can try a different way to get your alone time. I think a conversation, when you guys are less emotionally charged, about your needs that you need met, should happen. Because it sounds like there's some things on her end, prompting her to continually stay up late with you when she normally wouldn't be staying up. Maybe she has some needs, too, that she feels need to be met, that she just hasn't expressed?", "NTA. \n\nI used to live with a couple where the gf always did this and it was so fkn annoying even just to witness. Like, let a dude breathe man. Adults should not need to be babied 24/7. \nIt got to the point where he used to go into bed, wait for her to go to sleep and then sneak out and watch anime with me lol it was so hilarious but also sad.\n\nI'm also a person who needs a lot of time to myself and I ended up marrying a guy who was very much the same. So it may be a kind of incompatibility thing.\n\nEither way it's something you need to sort out between yourselves because that's one of those habits that's gonna build a lot of resentment if it keeps on going.", "Oh the gaslighting \n\nNTA \n\nShe is deliberately doing it.  She seems to think she has a right to every second of your free time.....either that or she suspects you're cheating", "I think it's either NTA or NAH, needs more info for this. How long are you in relationship? Was it always like this, that you spend next to 100% of your time together? Does she have friends? \n\nIt's quite possible you've been lovebirds for long enough for her to forget how to be on her own and now she feels like you are rejecting her, or that she is not enough if you need something else to do and spend time without her. My guess is that her reaction comes from a place of insecurity. Maybe try talking to her more? Like ask her to sit down and listen to your reasoning, not just a few phrases over dinner, but make it a separate conversation. Explain that you love her and love spending time with her, and with that you also love your own things, and don't want her to feel left out just because you need some \"me\" time, people are different. You could tell her later what you watched/learned in your alone time, and it could become another conversation topic. And yeah OP, it's time for you to claim some of the weekend time for yourself, and preferably outside the house, because if you don't start it now, later it will be harder, as there will be also an argument of \"but you liked spending all the time together just fine for all these years\".", "This is a weird one because why does she not want you to be alone but also why are you so mad at her for wanting to spend time with you", "You guys should talk like adults.

My partner and I are both introverts and need alone time to recharge but this is something we\u2019ve both known about each other from the outset of our relationship. If it wasn\u2019t and he came to me after 3 years of always spending free time together I\u2019d start to inwardly panic and reflect on what about me has necessitated the change. It\u2019s not always rational but girls internalise things and look inward when things like this happen, even if it\u2019s not remotely about them. Potentially your approach could have been softer. Talk to her and see how your request made her feel and help allay any insecurity she\u2019s feeling. Often times, that\u2019s all we need to feel better about something", "You shouldn't need to stay up late just to get some time to yourself - you're a childless, youngish couple (I assume) who lives together...you don't need to spend every free moment breathing in each others' carbon dioxide.\n\nWhen you live in a smallish place, it's harder to do your own thing (be that watch a movie, play games, whatever) so both people need to respect each other's space a bit, especially when it's been communicated clearly. You're not telling her to *get out*, just to...do her own thing for a little while and not interject.\n\nIt's probably just an introvert/extrovert thing. You're not TA, some people need some time to do their own thing and not interact non-stop.", "I don't know your GF, obv, so I don't know anything but what you've mentioned. But is it possible she's worried you're staying up to talk to some other girl or something (I'm not saying you are, just that the idea might be in her head)? Is she insecure or jealous as a rule?\n\nThis may be completely irrelevant, but I thought it might be worth mentioning just in case. \n\nEither way, you're NTA, unless you're leaving out something huge. \n\nPeople need alone time. Different people need different amounts but everyone needs SOME. We just don't all realise that, especially if (e.g.) we have some mental health stuff that is making it uncomfortable to be alone with our thoughts. But that's something separate that would need addressing if it were the case for her. It doesn't sound like that's it, though.  \n\nMaybe she can't sleep when you aren't next to her and doesn't know what to do about it apart from stay up until you come to bed too? It doesn't excuse her not giving you what you need, but it isn't necessarily malicious.  A lot of people in couples find that they get used to their partner's presence and come to depend on things like hearing them breathe in order to drift off.  \n\nI think a serious chat is in order, and if she can't be receptive to your needs, you need to work together to figure out why that is and how to repair it, or rethink the relationship if your respective needs are ultimately incompatible.", "Until his girl pops out of his suitcase.", "You are indeed deliberately trying to get away from her.", "10/10", "Sometimes it really seems like AITA is full of teenagers who have never been in an adult relationship.

She clearly does not want him to spend time alone.\n\nI do agree that talking about is necessary but I think the most likely explanation is that she is the type of person that wants to spend as much time with their partner so when he says he wants alone time she doesn't understand it and instead feels that him spending time without her is their relationship deteriorating. So she forces them to spend time together.\n\nWhile I may be off on the details of her motivation, I am fairly certain that the underlying issue is that she either doesn't understand or is not willing to accept the fact that he needs time alone.", "Good take, and a good follow-up question.", "We've been together around 3 years", "Because he specifically requested more time and alone and she won\u2019t leave him alone", "Because I should be allowed time to myself", "Sometimes I swear men can do no right in a relationship.

My parents are married and live together but I've never once heard either of them kick each other out of a room or say \"I don't want you around me\" Maybe the issue is one of long term compatibility and a deeper discussion about how you guys need things to work for you to successfully live together needs to happen.

My husband NEVER enters the bathroom when I shower, lest all the steam escape.

You haven't managed to communicate that very well to her, though.\n\nShe clearly has some issues here. Maybe she sleeps badly without you there, maybe she feels like she's not wanted. There's definitely a little kid in most of us that, when told someone else is staying up late and playing games, they want to be included.\n\nIn a similar situ I would (and actually did) start getting up earlier rather than staying up later. I could get my gaming on without disrupting her sleep routine, which incidentally was also preventing her from seducing me \\*(I obvs didn't know that was her intent - until we talked about it).\n\nHave a go at talking through the whole thing with her.

He's just asked her not to interrupt him during that time).
