She also has a habit of leaving taps running for no reason, and is generally not a very responsible person even when we are home.\n\nI convinced my husband to come along anyway, however, because she hasn\u2019t used in a few months so I thought it would be fine, plus it wanted him to help cover the costs for the trip.

As if your the victim of daughters substance disorder. Your not entitled to enjoy life by just bouncing away, as if you would be a victim if you didn\u2019t get to go to holidays at your sisters. \n\nYea you get to enjoy life, but that doesn\u2019t equate an entitlement to just take off when your family needs you. Your get to enjoy life within your means, and that isn\u2019t just financial means, but within your obligations, your family\u2019s needs.\n\nFor one your daughter seems to need help, and doesn\u2019t seems to be in a condition where she can be left alone. And her substance use disorder doesn\u2019t take a vacation just because you feel entitled to one, but I bet she and anyone else suffering for a substance use disorder wish they had such a magic button.\n\nHow you daughter should be care for and helped isn\u2019t remotely within an area I could offer any sound advise. But for your houses sake and your husbands (as he seem to understand substance use don\u2019t have vacations), you have to make a better plan then to leave your daughter alone in your house, at the least recruit an other adult to babysit her to not destroy the property and at best that she doesn\u2019t overdose.\n\nYou need to align you expectations with reality. You may have had the plan for your life where holidays away where among life\u2019s enjoyments. But this isn\u2019t a basic need to live, and you aren\u2019t entitled to destination vacations. Such things are privileges for people who are fortunate to have the funds, the time, the not ill relative to care for, the job who offer vacation times, the personal health to travel etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: \n\nI want to say so my intention isn\u2019t misinterpreted. From one perspective getting kids is a life long obligation to be their parent, however not all kids will grow up to be self sustainable adults who with grace your life with happy grandkids. Some kids will have lifelong health complications that will demand their parents to care for them way longer then just through collage. So from one aspect you have chosen the lottery at having children, where it\u2019s a possible scenario you might not get to carefree take vacations. \n\nBut I\u2019m not saying a substance abuse disorder is necessarily your responsibility as parents to an adult child. You can love the substance abuse out of her, and you can\u2019t cure her if she isn\u2019t motivated to recover. \n\nTo care for a an adult child with a mental disorder, physical ailment or a substance abuse disorder are more then likely incredibly demanding, thankless and draining. You are also doing this a lot of the time alone since your husband travels for work. From this aspect I get that you may need time away from your house, as your house is also a place that isn\u2019t the symbol of rest and comfort considering how you have to be a parent/drug use nurse there. \n\nBoth you and your husband need to get rest and mental breaks to be able to deal with this without breaking apart yourself. So from my perspective you (you and your husband) need to sit down and really have a frank discussion about it. What you two are willing to do, and what support you need to be able. I also recommend you consult someone knowable in substance use disorder to be part of such a conversation. This can be a sober person who themself have worked through 12 step program or a psychiatrist working with addiction or a person who work with rehabilitating addicts. \n\nCause you need to balance your life and her, because nothing gets better if you just feel suffocated.\n\nAn other aspect that I\u2019m also thinking about how much you are able to be there for the rest of your kids? Caring for a daughter so prone to relapses, do your other kids feel safe to leave there kids at you for some grandparents time? Do your other kids even feel able to have their parents active in their life\u2019s? I\u2019m just wondering how the cost for all of this is for the rest of the family. I mean it\u2019s reasonable a person with health problems need more care then otherwise healthy adults, but this is also an aspect that need to be in a frank discussion. \n\nAny choice you make have a cost to pay, caring for your daughter at home have the cost of not being able to pursue destination vacations, less availability to partake in other kids life. Not caring for your daughter at home may have the cost of a rehabilitation program which may make it impossible to keep your house or afford to travel, or that your daughter may live a homeless life while using drugs. But you can\u2019t pick one path and assume to not have the consequences and limitations of that choice.", "You had me until you said one of the reasons you wanted your husband to come along was to help pay for the trip.

How in the hell did it take 1 day for her to completely wreck the house and relapse?? That is insane. I would be surprised if she wasn't using in your house, even while being monitored.. I just find it really coincidental that she 'scored' by the time you were waiting out your layover. Either she still has contact with her plugs or she had it already.
