My boyfriend (36M) lives with his parents. \n\n- My mom is a very avid and frequent traveler. She retired early from a comfortable job and now spends her time visiting multiple countries and cities. She\u2019s very much into learning about different cultures, trying different activities, foods, etc. She always sends me postcards from the places she\u2019s visiting with a brief note on the back about where she is, what she\u2019s been doing.

During that time, my boyfriend agreed to housesit for me (water plants, feed my fish, bring in my mail) While I was gone, he got sick and his mom ended up coming over a few times to check on him at the house.\n\nEarlier today, I stopped by his house to get my key. His mom was there, and we started talking.

I told her that I would prefer if she didn\u2019t read my mail in the future, but she kept brushing it off saying it\u2019s no big deal and I\u2019m overreacting.

Their reasoning is that postcards are a \u201cfree for all\u201d because they aren\u2019t sealed in an envelope. I get that, but I still feel angry. Did I overreact?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI\u2019d like to clarify a few things that weren\u2019t clearly stated in my original post. I was worn our from traveling and probably not entirely coherent with posting.\n\nMy BF\u2019s mom was not housesitting for me. My BF was staying at my place to keep an eye on the place while I was gone. He got sick while I was gone and called his mom to come over. She came over a few times to visit him at my place while he was sick. \n\nMy boyfriend was the one bringing in my mail. The postcards were among a pile of mail in a cardboard box that I had left on my kitchen counter for collecting the mail. She was leafing through the box, saw the postcards and read them. I\u2019m annoyed that she was even going through the pile of mail on my counter to begin with, but I\u2019m also upset that she would criticize my mom like that.

I recognise the logos, return addresses etc. Mail is private but semi public.\n\nEtiquette is never to open it and not to mention what you learned from it. And that\u2019s if you are the person asked or known to handle it. It would be rude if your BF had read the postcards and commented. The fact his mom did it when she knew she was not given consent to rifle through your mail is rude AF.\n\nTo then give you a mental checklist of things about your mom she disapproved of, all of which seemed quite racist or xenophobic by calling other cultures \u2018weird\u2019 or critical of your mom\u2019s values sounds like she spent quite a lot of time reading them, dwelling on the content, probably talking to your BF about them is **excuse me? The audacity** level rude. Totally different to \u2018oh I hope this isn\u2019t rude but I saw the postcard, did your mum enjoy Egypt? Did she see the pyramids?\u2019\n\nI suspect this bothers you so much because you sense it is a tip of the iceberg issue.

My underwear drawer? Is she judging my housekeeping?\u2019\n\nAnd she wanted you to know she essentially scent marked your condo this way because dollars to donuts she has feelings about you travelling, being independent, owning property and how proper that is as a woman while her son still lives at home and has the boundaries of a mama\u2019s boy. In this economy lots of adults live at home but it\u2019s the attitude all the generations in multi generational households have that is key.

Commenting on your mother meals was just shit icing on the asshole cake.", "NTA\nComes to see sick son, ends up snooping in your house, you have no clue what other mischief she got into...", "I think your bf is rude for inviting his mom over to your house in your absence. And on top of that she snooped through your things. NTA in my opinion.", "And she didn't criticize her mother comment she said oh some of the food is weird I wouldn't eat that. That's just an opinion in a comment GF is too sensitive. But won't postcards are kind of a free-for-all they weren't out in public they were in a box stacked with other mail she had to look through it to find them, for that\n\nNta", "postcards aside I\u2019d break up with any 36 year old adult who relies so heavily on their mother. NTA.", "Everybody but your mom is the AH here. Yelling was uncalled for, indignation, sarcasm maybe but yelling, no. She read your mail & admitted it , immature , raised in a cave perhaps , IDK. Your BF allowed this, again immature ( he lives with his mom\u2026indication of maturity). He defended his mom when you yelled at her, understandable.", "NTA\n\nShe sees a box that is clearly for holding your mail while you're out of town working, and decides to rifle through it and bonus! finds postcards to read? What a B\\*\\*\\*\\*.", "NTA\u2026let\u2019s start with a 36yo man calling his mommy because he is sick\u2026.he couldn\u2019t have been that sick if he let mommy come take care of him a couple times! \n\nSecond\u2026who tf goes thru someone else\u2019s mail!!!! It\u2019s only acceptable to read someone\u2019s postcards if they are hung up for everyone to see\u2026not buried in a box with 3 weeks worth of mail!!! \n\nI would have been pissed too OP\u2026luckily my mil and my parents get along great!!! And I get along great with mil. If she would have talked crap about my mom I would have done the same!!", "WTF?? I've definitely never read a postcard that wasn't addressed to me past finding out who it was for.", "No, I would not read that if I were housesitting but maybe I just have more respect for the people that would trust me to house sit. I don\u2019t know where this \u201cwe\u201d is coming from. Maybe you and the rat in your pocket?", "How many levels are there? Is this Level 4 of 5?  Or 4 of 10?\nPlease factor in the update: BF's mom was rifling through a pile of OP's mail in a box; these were not postcards laying around. And she wasn't housesitting.", "I am honestly floored by the amount of people that think it\u2019s OK to read a postcard just because it\u2019s not in an envelope", "They were in a box of other mail. The fact that she went through that box looking at what the OP had received for mail is absolutely horrific behavior. And once they were in that box, where they weren\u2019t in public view, that absolutely was an invasion of privacy.", "Except it wasn\u2019t out in plain sight. The postcards we\u2019re in a stack of mail. That means his mother had to go through her stack of mail. There is absolutely no reason at all for her to have gone through that stack of mail other than the fact that she was being nosy about something that did not concerned her was not her business.", "If they have been mailed and pass through the US Postal Service, they are still federally protected like all other mail. Just because you might have the ability to read it because it\u2019s not in an envelope does not make it fucking OK for you to read it.", "Admiring the picture side of a postcard is fair game. Looking at the stamp is mildly intrusive, but ok. Reading the words on a postcard without the recipient's knowledge is not ok. Commenting on what's written is a big intrusion. Criticising the recipient's mother based on the actions they mentioned - that's a bridge too far.", "NTA. If she had visited you while you were home, would it have been cool for her to just casually start digging through your cardboard box of mail and reading everything in there, right in front of you? Ask your BF if he thinks that would be rude or perfectly acceptable. You don't do something in someone's home that you wouldn't do if they were there.", "NTA. He knew the mail was in the box on the counter, so he should have been appalled that his mother went through your mail instead of defending her behavior. What if a CC statement hadn't been sealed properly? Would that have been fair game as well? \nDo not apologize, and if he doesn't see that she was wrong, you're gonna have a whole other set of issues as this relationship progresses.", "NTA, she went through a box of your mail to find things she could read. Also, why does your 36yo bf live with his mom?", "NTA.  So your 36 year old BF couldn't be sick without calling Mommy in to take care of him?  Well you can tell why he still lives at home.  And NO, his mother should not have been rummaging through a box containing your mail.  The post cards were not in open sight - she went through your mail.  Maybe you should try dating an adult", "She is a busybody. You were correct. Your boyfriend is stuck in the middle and defended the wrong party.", "She's not wrong... postcards are a \"free for all.\"  If the message is a secret then, write a letter.\n\nHow many ppl do you think read the post card before it got to you?  I'm guessing a few", "NTA. \n\nOn a similar note, have you watch that show on the learning channel about being in love with a momma\u2019s boy? You might enjoy it.", "It\u2019s concerning that your bf is defending his mother for rummaging through your mail to read it, and then criticizing your mom and what she does on top of that?! Naw. This set of events makes him sound like a grade A, overly attached to mamma type of dude. These people are never good partners, because they let their families (mother in this case) trample all over your boundaries, and as you see here, excuse it as well. They have no concept of a healthy family dynamic, so this is their normal, and anything else is wrong.", "Yeah, the edit makes it really clear that his mom had NO justification at all. Creepy.", "I would as soon as the person commented on what they\u2019d read then doubled down *when they had been at my house without my knowledge or consent*.\n\nBoyfriend would get a grilling too. \n\nHe was so sick his mother had to come *snoop*?\n\nBecause you know that\u2019s exactly what she was doing.", "Where does it say that?\nHis mom came to check on him at the house. She wasn\u2019t staying there."]}
