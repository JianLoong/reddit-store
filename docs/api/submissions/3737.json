{"id": 3737, "submission_id": "za9uk7", "title": "AITA for yelling at my boyfriend\u2019s mom?", "selftext": "On mobile, please excuse formatting.\n\nSome information that may be relevant:\n\n- I (37F) live in a small condo. My boyfriend (36M) lives with his parents. \n\n- My mom is a very avid and frequent traveler. She retired early from a comfortable job and now spends her time visiting multiple countries and cities. She\u2019s very much into learning about different cultures, trying different activities, foods, etc. She always sends me postcards from the places she\u2019s visiting with a brief note on the back about where she is, what she\u2019s been doing. Depending on her schedule, she will sometimes hang onto multiple postcards and send them out together, so it\u2019s not uncommon to receive several postcards at one time from her. \n\nThe story:\n\nI was out of town for 3 weeks for work. During that time, my boyfriend agreed to housesit for me (water plants, feed my fish, bring in my mail) While I was gone, he got sick and his mom ended up coming over a few times to check on him at the house.\n\nEarlier today, I stopped by his house to get my key. His mom was there, and we started talking. She made a comment about how some of the foods and things my mom had tried were \u201cdownright weird\u201d and \u201csomething she would never do\u201d I asked her what she meant and she admitted that she had read some postcards from my mom that had showed up while I was gone. I told her that I would prefer if she didn\u2019t read my mail in the future, but she kept brushing it off saying it\u2019s no big deal and I\u2019m overreacting. I snapped and yelled at her telling her that she needed to learn how to respect boundaries. \n\nMy boyfriend defended his mom, and they both called me an AH for yelling at her. Their reasoning is that postcards are a \u201cfree for all\u201d because they aren\u2019t sealed in an envelope. I get that, but I still feel angry. Did I overreact?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI\u2019d like to clarify a few things that weren\u2019t clearly stated in my original post. I was worn our from traveling and probably not entirely coherent with posting.\n\nMy BF\u2019s mom was not housesitting for me. My BF was staying at my place to keep an eye on the place while I was gone. He got sick while I was gone and called his mom to come over. She came over a few times to visit him at my place while he was sick. \n\nMy boyfriend was the one bringing in my mail. The postcards were among a pile of mail in a cardboard box that I had left on my kitchen counter for collecting the mail. She was leafing through the box, saw the postcards and read them. I\u2019m annoyed that she was even going through the pile of mail on my counter to begin with, but I\u2019m also upset that she would criticize my mom like that. She\u2019s never met my mom.", "created_utc": 1669951413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za9uk7/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriends_mom/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's using the postcards as a means to judge and criticize your mother. Had this lady told you that your mother is brave, amazing and inspirational, you probably wouldn't have minded the privacy invasion quite so much...\n\nYou're definitely NTA. You are rightfully mad and upset that your mother was criticized. And in this context, the invasion of privacy was the cherry on top of the shitcake.", "NTA. Postcards are pretty impossible not to read if you happen to see one facing upward, and they\u2019ve likely already been read several times by the time they get to you.\n\nBut, I absolutely would not bring up content on someone else\u2019s postcard. It seems like something you just never mention out of politeness. And the correct response to you feeling uncomfortable should have been an apology.", "I might cop a downvote on this but I think reading postcards is like... maybe a Level 4 offence. \n\nOverly familiar, yes, but not super egregious. \n\nHowever, if you ask her not to and she argues about it, *that* is super disrepectful no matter what.\n\nSo, NTA", "NTA Invade your privacy AND call your mother\u2019s choices weird? Incredibly rude and disrespectful of you and your mom.", "NTA. It's still an invasion of piracy", "NTA. No you didn\u2019t overreact. \n\nShe was way out of pocket making comments about your mail that she read.", "NTA. It\u2019s an invasion of privacy and she tried brushing it off as if it were nothing. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t like people reading her mail.", "NTA it is intended for you. It's weird that she would snoop like that. If you had a tax return on your counter would she have read it?", "NTA that's not how many of this works, she had no right to read any of your mail, envelope or not", "NTA and you should truly consider this relationship. \n\nIf he\u2019s in his mid 30\u2019s and still has his mommy coming by to check on him when he\u2019s sick with the sniffles, his ability to be an adult might be in question. \n\nReading other peoples mail is a breach of trust. And it\u2019s fucking weird.", "NTA. For her to read the postcards was bad enough; critiquing them to you crossed the line by far. What your mom does is certainly none of her business, and she should\u2019ve kept her highhanded judgments to herself.", "NTA\n\nThe problem here is not that bf's mom read the postcards. The problem is that she made negative comments about the things your mom wrote about. Your bf's mom had no business giving her opinions of those things. Those comments were really about your mom, and not about some business that's advertising with postcards. That's where bf's mom crossed the line between normal curiosity and being nosy and meddlesome.\n\nYour bf's mom does need to learn how to respect boundaries. She also needs to learn better manners.", "Nta. Reading a post card isn't great but it's not the end of the world especially if they are lying around because frankly nothing important should ever be written on them. \n\nInfo: what she chatting or just criticising. E.g. if someone is eating a grass hopper sandwich that's both something weird and something I'd never do... Which is not critical of the person doing it but rather just a comment on the activity itself.", "NTA. She was nosey and shouldn't be reading your mail, regardless of the format. That being said, I do think you overreacted a bit by yelling at her - everything you said was fine and justified (which is why you're NTA), but I might apologize to her for yelling/raising your voice at her, while saying that you stand by what you said tho should've communicated it in a different way.", "assuming you're based in the U.S. and that this applies to postcards but pretty sure opening/reading someone else's mail is a felony lol", "NTA. Don\u2019t read other peoples mail.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nListen very carefully to them, as your boyfriend and his mother are both telling you exactly who they are right now.\n\nEdit to add **his** mother", "ESH. Postcards are NOT private conversations, so she read them because she brought in your mail. But also, she had no business making comments about what she thinks your mother should or should not do. You shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but your BF should have understood enough to say, \u201cmom\u2026 why were you reading her mail? Why were you mocking her mother? You don\u2019t think I would have yelled at HER mom if the reverse happened and she was talking as if she was disgusted with the things YOU do?\u201d  Apologies are warranted all around.", "NTA.\n\nWhile is uncomfortable - should it come up again, I would suggest you mention that her outgoing nature and willingness to explore is part of what made her the mom to you - the person her son wants a relationship with.", "NTA", "ESH - She shouldn't have been nosey and read the postcards, but postcards aren't private correspondence either. You however shouldn't have yelled at her. You could have been firm about your feelings, but yelling at someone over reading a postcard when they were doing you a favor is overkill.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you'd been angry at her for what she said about your mom, that would make sense.", "Its an invasion of privacy and she sucks and should have apologized instead of doubling down. And their defense is lame as fuck.\n\n\nBut with that said, i dont think yelling for this is ok, sorry. Your bf seem to only have reacted when you yelled, and not before so good of him.

You should not have yelled.", "NTA but I hope you never need her to housesit again.  If you had previously had a fine relationship, yelling at someone who had just done you a favor that they had no responsibility to do at all seems a but extreme.  Reading a postcard is a bit nosey but it\u2019s not like she went through your cupboards and drawers looking for mail.  She got your mail for you, saw an unsealed post cars and went huh interesting and casually tried to chat with you about it.  It seems something pretty minor to permanently blow up the relationship with your partner\u2019s family over.  But if that is your line in the sand, you definitely established it.", "YTA.

Obviously circumstances are different for everyone and maybe he just had a bad break with work when the economy took a shit. \n\n\nBut his mommy coming to take care of him when he had the sniffles is an enormous red flag.

All I\u2019m saying is, pick your battles. Post Cards are not secret conversations, that\u2019s not the hill I would die on here. Focus on the part that is clearly wrong: MIL should not have been making comments about OP\u2019s mother. Policing what people read when it\u2019s openly displayed in front of them is not feasible, and almost happens automatically for people who are avid readers.", "Agreed, but also\u2026 not something that can be controlled or that can be reasonably policed. She could have read the postcards and not said anything, and that would be fine. The problem here isn\u2019t that MIL read the postcards, it\u2019s that she was making unnecessary comments.", "The original post was unclear about how the mother came to read the postcards. OP made it sound like mother went to her house instead of the sick boyfriend. \n\nStill not something you yell at a person about.", "Its more of the I live with my mother and call her to my gfs place the second I feel sick that give me the impression of a mommies boy. Most grown people I know who live with their parents are glad for some time away even if they get a cold", "Let\u2019s be clear; they\u2019re both problems. \n\nIf she\u2019s willing to read a post-card and think nothing of that invasion of privacy, what else does she consider fair game? Peeking in drawers? The medicine cabinet? Emails? Where is the line for this person? \n\nMaking snide remarks about OP\u2019s mom is a dumb kind of problem that can be ignored if the relationship with the boyfriend is really meaningful and fulfilling. The invasion of privacy and co-dependency a mid-30\u2019s man has with his mom is alarmingly kind of problem.", "Yes that is alarming. The dependency on a \u201cmommy\u201d to heal his wounds is an emotionally labor that OP should really consider if she\u2019s willing to give. \n\nCause you know that dude ain\u2019t doing laundry or cooking meals. Mommy takes care of that I\u2019m sure."]}
