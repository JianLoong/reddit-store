I have a very traditional Irish name and my partner is also Irish. My dream baby boy\u2019s name is also a very very unusual Irish name that I\u2019ve wanted to name a boy since I was 17/18. When I announced my pregnancy to my step sister, she also said she was pregnant (a month further along than me). I was so excited that we\u2019d be pregnant at the same time. She already has 3 children from a previous relationship and I was so relieved and happy I could confide in her and ask her for advice. One of the first things on the call she asked me was \u201cdo you have any names?\u201d. I said yes and told her my boys name. She said ohhh that\u2019s my name. But said she was thinking of others. I was shocked, as I had mentioned to her at a family party that that was my dream name. I told her this and she said she couldn\u2019t remember. After going through my messages I found a message I sent her in 2018, when I met my partner saying \u201c he also loves my baby boy name too with the name\u201d, there was no message back then saying wow that\u2019s my name. When I sent her this screenshot there was zero acknowledgment. All her other children have English names and this name is a very traditional Gaelic name. (She is also Irish and her partner is English). There\u2019s zero acknowledgment she has stolen the name. I feel if this was the other way around I\u2019d back off the name and feel a bit embarrassed. I\u2019ve tried to give her time and suggested other Irish names, but she\u2019s now saying if my baby is a girl she\u2019s using my name. Meaning if my next child is a boy I can\u2019t use the name I have dreamed of for nearly 20 years. I also feel it\u2019s put a cloud on our gender reveal. Plus I don\u2019t really want to go talk to get as much, her baby shower is in a few months and part of me doesn\u2019t want to go. Then I don\u2019t want us having conflict, as it will cause stress..Any advice??\n\n\nFor clarity; I understand no-one owns a name. I found the messages by searching the name  in messenger, so didn\u2019t keep them for years etc. I think it\u2019s the closeness that upset me as it\u2019s my sister essentially and we\u2019re close. For clarity- it\u2019s not a name in the family at all, or of a living or passed relative.. I really respect the opinions given as it\u2019s given me a good unbiased view. \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1678619747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pc4oy/aita_for_resenting_the_fact_my_step_sister_stole/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fake name, but real lineages:\n\nMy grandfather's name was Liam.  His son (my uncle) was Liam Jr.  My mom had a son and named him Liam.
