I have a very traditional Irish name and my partner is also Irish. My dream baby boy\u2019s name is also a very very unusual Irish name that I\u2019ve wanted to name a boy since I was 17/18. When I announced my pregnancy to my step sister, she also said she was pregnant (a month further along than me). I was so excited that we\u2019d be pregnant at the same time. She already has 3 children from a previous relationship and I was so relieved and happy I could confide in her and ask her for advice. One of the first things on the call she asked me was \u201cdo you have any names?\u201d. I said yes and told her my boys name. She said ohhh that\u2019s my name. But said she was thinking of others. I was shocked, as I had mentioned to her at a family party that that was my dream name. I told her this and she said she couldn\u2019t remember. After going through my messages I found a message I sent her in 2018, when I met my partner saying \u201c he also loves my baby boy name too with the name\u201d, there was no message back then saying wow that\u2019s my name. When I sent her this screenshot there was zero acknowledgment. All her other children have English names and this name is a very traditional Gaelic name. (She is also Irish and her partner is English). There\u2019s zero acknowledgment she has stolen the name. I feel if this was the other way around I\u2019d back off the name and feel a bit embarrassed. I\u2019ve tried to give her time and suggested other Irish names, but she\u2019s now saying if my baby is a girl she\u2019s using my name. Meaning if my next child is a boy I can\u2019t use the name I have dreamed of for nearly 20 years. I also feel it\u2019s put a cloud on our gender reveal. Plus I don\u2019t really want to go talk to get as much, her baby shower is in a few months and part of me doesn\u2019t want to go. Then I don\u2019t want us having conflict, as it will cause stress..Any advice??\n\n\nFor clarity; I understand no-one owns a name. I found the messages by searching the name  in messenger, so didn\u2019t keep them for years etc. I think it\u2019s the closeness that upset me as it\u2019s my sister essentially and we\u2019re close. I really respect the opinions given as it\u2019s given me a good unbiased view. \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1678619747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pc4oy/aita_for_resenting_the_fact_my_step_sister_stole/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like she\u2019s compromising and saying that if your baby is a boy (this time), she\u2019ll happily choose something else. But you can\u2019t keep the name forever.

There\u2019s a chance you see your baby on the day he\u2019s born and decide that the same doesn\u2019t fit and you go with something else. There\u2019s also probably a very good chance that she doesn\u2019t remember that conversation and has just fallen Inlove with the name along the way. You aren\u2019t the main character in her story.

She is really wrong for doing that but there's nothing you can do. Name your child that anyway if you want, especially if it's a few years later. Alternatively, can you find another name you also love and call him both? Like if the name you loved was Declan, name him Declan Shane and call him both.

Just because you sent a text 5 years ago with this name, does not automatically mean she remembers it or even attached any value to what you said in that text. And then the fact that you sent a screenshot just adds to the pettiness of the sentiment on your end - no wonder she didn\u2019t reply.\n\nJust be happy you both have healthy pregnancies. If you both end up with children with the same name, it isn\u2019t a big deal. This is not worth souring a relationship with a family member.", "Just tell her that you 100% WILL be using that name for your first son even if she uses it, no matter what.

I agree it\u2019s sus she doesn\u2019t remember you saying that was your first baby name preference.

Don't make drama where it doesn't need to be.", "So you WBTA for skipping her shower, but I understand why you feel the way you do. Maybe talk to her further about the name if you absolutely are 100% planning on using it if you have a boy in the future. But plenty of people have all girls or boys, would you feel bad if having a boy didn't pan out? And maybe ask her how she would feel if two kids had this name in the family?

Does it really matter if there are two Elmo\u2019s in the family? What she did isn\u2019t cool but she hasn\u2019t really even done it yet. She remembered liking a name from ages ago. You still have a ways to go, don\u2019t stress over a name.", "NTA but it is what it is. If the name was so dear to you, you should have kept it a secret and revealed it only after the baby has been named. Its not like the name can be copyrighted, so anyone and everyone is free to choose the name for their child. You can still pick the same name as its your child and don't have to care about how others feel. Or you could look around for other names as well. Regarding your sister and how you feel towards her is upto to you. She might have got an idea from your messages back them or it might have come to her automatically without even your message or previous mention. Just because you have always wanted it doesn't make it right to want her to drop her. Its upto her to decide if she want to use the name or not and the same applies to you.
