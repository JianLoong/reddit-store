As always my dog was with me and he was well behaved and sat in a place the whole time. Also I promised that I would visit them today again and bring my Switch to keep the 4 year old entertained (he has a fractured leg and shouldn\u2019t move too much). \nToday my sister told me that his partner suddenly developed an allergy towards dogs because his eyes got itchy when he came home after work and when I\u2019m visiting her today my dog should stay in the garden alone. I told her that I won\u2019t do that because he\u2019s not used to it, it\u2019s cold and windy. \nI didn\u2019t tell her yet that I\u2019m not visiting. \n\nWe received a text message from her partner (while I was on the phone with my sister) where he basically wrote the same thing what my sister told me. My mum got furious and called my sister and it turned out that my sister would be mad at me for not coming because I promised that I would bring my Switch and so on and she thinks that the dog staying outside is a reasonable request. \nMy mum said that we won\u2019t come as our clothing/ car is also full of dog hair. \n\nI totally can understand that the dog shouldn\u2019t come and allergies developing but I think I can refuse to come if my dog suddenly isn\u2019t allowed inside. \nSo WIBTA?\n\nEdit: \nHe barks the whole time I\u2019m away. He can stay only 30-60 min completely alone for now. (Still in training) Usually I have someone to watch him. I just don\u2019t want to visit her today/ tomorrow because on short notice I don\u2019t have anyone. \nIn the future I will visit my sister without the dog.
