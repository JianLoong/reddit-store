Also I promised that I would visit them today again and bring my Switch to keep the 4 year old entertained (he has a fractured leg and shouldn\u2019t move too much). \nToday my sister told me that his partner suddenly developed an allergy towards dogs because his eyes got itchy when he came home after work and when I\u2019m visiting her today my dog should stay in the garden alone. I told her that I won\u2019t do that because he\u2019s not used to it, it\u2019s cold and windy. \nI didn\u2019t tell her yet that I\u2019m not visiting. \n\nWe received a text message from her partner (while I was on the phone with my sister) where he basically wrote the same thing what my sister told me. My mum got furious and called my sister and it turned out that my sister would be mad at me for not coming because I promised that I would bring my Switch and so on and she thinks that the dog staying outside is a reasonable request. \nMy mum said that we won\u2019t come as our clothing/ car is also full of dog hair. \n\nI totally can understand that the dog shouldn\u2019t come and allergies can suddenly develop but I think I can refuse to come if my dog suddenly isn\u2019t allowed inside. \nSo WIBTA?\n\nEdit: \nHe barks the whole time I\u2019m away. He can stay only 30-60 min completely alone for now. (Still in training) Usually I have someone to watch him. I just don\u2019t want to visit her today/ tomorrow because on short notice I don\u2019t have anyone. \nIn the future I will visit my sister without the dog. I just need a few days notice so I can plan it properly.\n\nAnother edit: \nThe last 6 years there was absolutely no issue with my dog being with us.

Everyone paid their respects and seemed to understand that she was gone.", "Our vet explained this to us, and it nearly broke my heart, because we had our kitty cremated and her brother never ever got over the loss. \n\nUntil the day he died, 4 years later, he looked for her and cried for her.", "Our baby was grief stricken and very quiet (whereas she is normally sassy, loud, naughty, etc) but when we buried her best friend\u2019s ashes she cried and screamed and screamed. I have never, before or after, heard pain in her voice like that. \n\nShe literally looked like she had a different face for a while after. She\u2019s doing much better now, 5 years later, but still gets stressed out when my mom isn\u2019t home. ((Even if someone else, or lots of other people are home))", "I'm so sorry for your loss.  We went through the same thing.  We had 5 cats at the same time,  and being close in age,  we lost 4 of them in 2 years.  3 we were able to choose the time and do it at home.  We let all the other cats come and see them after, and I hope it helped them.  One of them was diagnosed with cancer on a Tuesday and died in my arms the next day.  Not a sign anything was wrong until a week before diagnosis. \n\nOur last one, our little girl,  went peacefully at home on her own,  with us lying next to her, at the age of 22.\n\nWe do intend to have more cats at some point,  but after years of caring for elderly cats, we're taking a break.  Will do it all over again, tho, and we were happy to have the means to let them go peacefully at home when it was an option.", "This reminds me of the reel I saw today about a dog burying his cat buddy. [Read the caption.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoK3rzKqhcX/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)", "So the conclusion here is I need an emergency epipen when I hit 40.\n\nI\u2019m glad they got help quickly! That\u2019s so scary \ud83d\ude1f", "i just posted my own comment but i am living proof of that", "Repost of No-Koala8996's comment. Downvote and report.", "Yeah, and I\u2019m hoping my mother\u2019s luck isn\u2019t hereditary. She also gained tons of other allergies of varying degrees, from peanuts to celery, to most nuts, to types of lettuce. Was never allergic to anything as a child. And now I\u2019ve had a questionable reaction to kiwi and a peach, so my fun may just be beginning.", "Heh, yeah: I know it's a thing, but I'm still somehow always shocked when it gets me. :'(", "Which I believe is why he didn't go this time, as it was short notice. If the sister can't have the courtesy to give a heads up ahead of time then OP can't come, and she has to accept that this is the new reality. No ahead of time notice, no help from OP.", "We had a cat behaviourist come by to help us with our cats and she recommended something called iCalmCat and/or iCalmDog music. The music can be found on YouTube but we actually went to Amazon and bought the speaker kit. It's a mix of classical type music and actually really helped our fur babies.", "Incredible callout, thx \ud83d\udc9c", "Oh you are a wonderful human! I will definitely be giving this a try, thank you! We lost our oldest on Christmas so this is all super new and we are working on it but any tool that can help is much appreciated. \n\nTo all those who leave TV on, I so wish I could. My yorkie is a TV watcher, which is adorable but not a great relaxation tool. I did put on The Great British Baking Show to see if she likes it and she does love it. So far her favorite show is Game of Thrones (which we figured was driven by prey drive) but she oddly enjoys woodworking/turning videos so I knew there was a chance she\u2019d enjoy it.", "Thank you for this suggestion! I didn't even think of YouTube but have it on now!", "Not a problem, I hope it works."]}
