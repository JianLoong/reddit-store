I (M22) have a small dog (6) and we had no issues with my sister nor her partner. \nHere\u2019s what happened: \nYesterday I was visiting her because she needed help at home because her partner had a 24h shift. As always my dog was with me and he was well behaved and sat in a place the whole time. Also I promised that I would visit them today again and bring my Switch to keep the 4 year old entertained (he has a fractured leg and shouldn\u2019t move too much). \nToday my sister told me that his partner suddenly developed an allergy towards dogs because his eyes got itchy when he came home after work and when I\u2019m visiting her today my dog should stay in the garden alone. I told her that I won\u2019t do that because he\u2019s not used to it, it\u2019s cold and windy. \nI didn\u2019t tell her yet that I\u2019m not visiting. \n\nWe received a text message from her partner (while I was on the phone with my sister) where he basically wrote the same thing what my sister told me. My mum got furious and called my sister and it turned out that my sister would be mad at me for not coming because I promised that I would bring my Switch and so on and she thinks that the dog staying outside is a reasonable request. \nMy mum said that we won\u2019t come as our clothing/ car is also full of dog hair. \n\nI totally can understand that the dog shouldn\u2019t come and allergies developing but I think I can refuse to come if my dog suddenly isn\u2019t allowed inside. \nSo WIBTA?\n\nEdit: \nHe barks the whole time I\u2019m away. He can stay only 30-60 min completely alone for now. (Still in training) Usually I have someone to watch him. I just don\u2019t want to visit her today/ tomorrow because on short notice I don\u2019t have anyone. \nIn the future I will visit my sister without the dog.

Doesn\u2019t even sound like she\u2019s giving the sister an ultimatum.", "Because this was not a matter of \"you can't take it because it's illegal\". As you said this was not a problem before. Now, when it's an issue he decided not to go. How can people tell him his choice was wrong?", "Do you have any answer that requires some brain function, or just \"lmao\"?", "Would you tell a woman who can't have children or lost their babies that need therapy if they get a dog to fill that void? That woman will treat that dog as a child. \nWould you say the same to a woman who has a reborn baby doll? That's a lifeless doll that helps them go through the trauma. A dog does the same, and it's alive.", "Muzzles don\u2019t prevent dog barking. If they do prevent barking, then the dog is unable to get a full pant, which will lead to overheating (as their only source of controlling their temperature). Furthermore, you should not muzzle your dog without supervision because it can lead to overheating and potential death. \n\nIf a dog is barking due to separation anxiety, their owner should work on slowly building up the amount of time out of the room, or house, depending on the severity of the anxiety (say, in 5 minute bursts, perhaps less) until a suitable time period has been established. The owner should also consider crate training their dog to provide a safe space so that their dog does not hurt themselves or damage any property.\n\nSource: dog is muzzle trained through a dog behaviourist, and my vets have also provided this caution prior to muzzle training. Dog was a rescue and prior to adoption I liaised with dog behaviourists on techniques I might needs depending on how she acclimatised to my home.", "They could drop off the switch because they already agreed to let the child use it and the change in circumstances isn't the child's fault or doing. \nIt's not like it's an extra inconvenience the dog was coming in the car either way it'd essentially be the same trip for op vs the sister coming to op doesn't sound as feasible as the whole reason op was going there and offered the console was because the sister has a literal injured child who shouldn't be moving around.", "Why? Arguments? They are both defenceless and need you, you are responsible for both your entire life.", "> Mom changed plans. Kid is mom\u2019s responsibility, not uncle\u2019s.\n\nThis is true, and I never said it wasn\u2019t. I never said OP was an asshole either. I said the nice thing to do was still let the kid borrow the Switch, and for OP to look into getting some training for the dog because eventually there will be other places the dog cannot go. Not sure why you\u2019re so agitated when I did not in any way say OP was in the wrong; I suggested a reasonable solution to OP\u2019s query.", "With a fractured leg, it would be slim.", "I dont hate dogs. Even if I did, why are you dismissive of that? The feelings of others dont count here? My problem is people who think their dogs are more important than other people. People they claim to love. That said, enjoy your day.", "Don't forget some women can't have kids, or they lost many babies trying and a pet can fill that void.", "That's a disingenuous argument.\n\nA potted plant is defenseless and needs you, but to a far lesser extent than a dog, just like a dog is defenseless and needs you to a far lesser extent than a child.  Sharing a basic concept does not create an equivalence.\n\nRaising a human and looking after a pet are worlds apart in terms of complexity.", "I am hardly agitated. \n\nMom changed plans - uncle doesn\u2019t owe the kid a Switch. \n\nDog training takes time. Even with an amenable dog and an experienced trainer, training takes time and repetition. If sister has banned the dog, she shouldn\u2019t expect to see the brother for a couple weeks to several months, including his expensive tech.", "Still doesn't make a pet equal to a human. They are still pets regardless of how you feel.", "Just because they have a different type of complexity doesn't mean you can't treat them with the same love and care.", "No one said the sister should expect to see OP going forward. You keep just making arguments I said nothing about. Bottom line you and I disagree. No reason to keep going in circles about it. You aren\u2019t changing my mind and I\u2019m not changing yours.", "I disagree. I know dogs smarter, cleaner, and less annoying than many people. What makes those people better than a dog? Just because it's a human?", "No, but it does literally mean that a pet takes less work than a child, and they are therefore not the same thing, which you argued against."]}
