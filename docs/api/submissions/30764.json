Your ex is a deadbeat Dad, just like my husband was in the 80's and 90's. The only difference is that the courts no longer tolerate this BS.

How you gonna cut the umbilical cord of one of the children, knowing you meant something to the mom, then get mad bc you didn't care enough to make him be a father?

If Carl has an issue with the garnishment, that\u2019s actually between him and the courts, not between him and OP. Carl is free to hire an attorney and/or file whatever paperwork to try to get the amount reduced.

Aside from the GF speaking over him on FaceTime I saw nothing in the post to indicate he even knows about it.", "Yup, when I found out the guy I was dating was a deadbeat it took all my attraction for him away and I stopped seeing him.

What kind of person moves in with a person in carls situation and actively tries to squelch on child support?

He\u2019s a loser and so is she. The wage garnishment isn\u2019t your decision either, it\u2019s the courts.

Wow honestly it\u2019s stories like this that makes me glad I\u2019m a loner at times. What kind of best friend  gets with her best friends  kids father right after breaking up!? She had to have been plotting the whole relationship just truly disgusting.  Good for you finally putting him on child support. It takes two people to tango and if he wants to be a deadbeat  dad so be it but he\u2019s needs to cough up child support and his pathetic girlfriend can shut the fuck up. It\u2019s so pathetic when dead beat parents new partners back them up in not taking care of their child.", "I hope you are getting disability and respite care for your kids.
