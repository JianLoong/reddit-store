So I started using their staples and bought extra of the food they were eating.  This became a problem when they figured it out.  Apparently my food was for sharing but not theirs.  \n\nSo moved in with my boyfriend.  It was stupid. We were way too young.  But we survived.  He was in college and his parents had rented him a small apartment.  Very small.  I worked to pay for all the extras we needed with me living there.  His parents knew I had moved in and said I would have to pay rent.  They charged me $400 a month.  My parents were charging me $800.  \n\nThe few times I saw my parents they tried to convince me to come home.  The one time I brought my boyfriend home they wouldn't let us share a room. We ended up getting a hotel for the night and going back after one day. \n\nI worked my ass off and helped my boyfriend with his schoolwork.  When he graduated we got married and I went to school.  We used my savings to pay off his student loans and then he paid for my college.  \n\nNow we have a nice house in a great neighborhood and we rent out the basement suite on Airbnb.  We get a lot of tourists but also families that are visiting the city to see the university.  \n\nMy parents have come out a few times and the suite has always been booked.  So they stayed at a hotel.  Last time though it was not.  They asked if they could stay there and save the hotel bill.  \n\nI double checked that we didn't have any bookings and said sure and told them to book on the app.  They got all mad that I was going to charge them.  Or relationship has always been transactional so I didn't see a problem.   \n\nThey said I was an asshole for making family pay rent.  I reminded them that they started charging me rent and stealing my food when I was 17.  \n\nThey ended up staying at the hotel and not coming over anymore during their visit.  \n\nMy brother called me and said I was being a vindictive jerk and that he always let them stay with him for free.  He also went straight to college so he didn't have to pay them rent.  \n\nMy parents asked if they could stay this summer when our baby comes.

I\u2019m saying that because that portion of your home they are asking to use provides income for your household.

I'm guessing there's more to the story that is being left out. If I had to guess I would say that they were probably charging you rent for a reason although $800 seems very high. Also it sounds like none of this happened until after you graduated high school which I'm guessing was to get you to understand the cost of living rather than being particularly transactional. It seems odd that you have an Airbnb downstairs and they want to come and see you and your baby and you would charge them to come stay. Like I said in the beginning, it sounds like you don't want a relationship with your parents. That is up to you but I feel like there will be consequences for everyone later including your child. Have you ever considered actually talking with your parents about how you feel instead of being petty and passive aggressive? Maybe consider family therapy?", "[deleted]", "YTA.  \nThis isn't about paying rent. Like your brother said, this is about you being vindictive.

Maybe if OP's parents didn\u2019t play favorites I don\u2019t doubt OP would be ok with it (I could be wrong though) but they chose to make OP pay rent, so OP is charging them rent. \n\nAirbnb is literally renting a place for a short amount of time", "How do you mean?", "What are you smoking my friend?", "You're right. One was charging a minor child when still under legal obligation to feed and shelter them. The other is trying to make use of a business asset without recompensing the owner. The parents aren't staying at her house - they would have been staying at a self-contained short-term rental property she owns.", "I make money with that suite.  Can you give me a good reason to give up.that money when we have a baby on the way?", "I think the parents destroyed the relationship themselves when they decided to charge a 17 year old $800 a month to live at home.", "Perfect!\n\nAlso, NTA.", "Awesome.

You're parents... dude, this isn't about money. That's your rationalization. This sounds like payback. If you have a healthy relationship with your parents you don't tell them to do that. You had an unbooked room available and you told your parents to book it through the app. An unbooked room wouldn't have generated any revenue for you. Your parents not coming over because they don't want to book your room does not generated any revenue for you. You're not getting money either way. This is straight up payback.  \nLike I said, if you have a garbage relationship with your parents and they are insignificant in your life then whatever. Nothing wrong with what you're doing.
