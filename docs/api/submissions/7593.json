I'm also very angry atm, so forgive any mistakes.\n\nMy BF (male, mid-thirties) has a daughter G (10) with his ex-wife, T. \n\nThe ex-wife is fighting a very aggressive form of brain cancer.\n\nNow, a bit of back-story.  T and I never did get on well. I met my BF while he was in the proceedings of their divorce, and I think she's always thought we had an affair long before then.\n\nShe hates me a lot, and so does G. I've been called a home-wrecker, a slut and other nice things ever since I first met them.\n\nNow, my BF is usually very quick to shut down their bullshit, but he adores his daughter and still cares about ex-wife (they've been together 15 years, and been friends since their childhood).\n\nEver since the diagnosis, he's been the one driving ex-wife to medical appointments and such, and he's asked me the favor to look after his daughter while he's with T.\n\nHe knows what a huge favour it is (he's thanked me profusely every time) and I know how much he needs my help.\n\nEverything went to shit a few hrs ago, when I was asked to bring G back to her mother's house.\n\nT started saying I must be glad she's dying, because I can keep BF to myself now. She said I must be happy, because now I get to keep her daughter and pretend she's mine.\n\nShe said a lot of ugly things, and BF didn't do anything to correct her. \n\nI stayed really quiet, because to be frank I was incredibly shocked. Still am, tbh.\n\nWhen we got home I lost it with him and told him I wouldn't keep his daughter any longer, not if he allowed T to talk to me in such a manner. \n\nHe said I'd be a huge asshole if I went through with this because T has just found she's only got few weeks left and not the months she'd previously thought.\n\nIs he right?

Do understand though, this likely isn't the real her, she's literally grappling with life and death and the amount of pain she must be in emotionally knowing she won't be there for her daughter must be driving her crazy. Ever seen the movie \"Stepmom\"?\n\nThis is your choice though - you don't have to take it. YWNBTA to step away altogether.  Just don't expect to stay in that relationship if you refuse to watch his daughter - this feels like a deal-breaker for you both.", "There are no AH\u2019s here.  This is so far above AITA\u2019s pay grade. \n\nA dying mother lashing out at the most convenient target.  And brain cancer?  This is 100% affecting her ability to filter and regulate what she says. \n\nA partner watching the mother of his child, someone he once loved, die.  He\u2019s with you and doesn\u2019t want to make this harder on anyone. \n\nA child caught in the middle of all of this.\n\nAnd you, with your very valid feelings of being unfairly treated. \n\nYou need to find a grief therapist NOW, one that you can talk to, one that BF and daughter can go to. This is going to be a very rough ride. \n\nNAH", "This is a hard situation.  Do you want to be co-parenting G with BF?  Does he expect you to?  That's actually the most important conversation right now.\n\nAfter that, help until you want to break up with BF.  \n\nDon't blame T too much for anything in her condition.  If she's down to weeks, it's probably affecting her emotional self-regulation and her ability to keep her thoughts inside her head.", "I think YWNBTA. \nI am sure, there are other friends or family to take her to hospital besides the Ex boyfriend who should spend that time with his child imo. \n\nAnd to be asking OP who has had to deal with bs from G. And T. from the start, to be babysitting, so OPs bf can take his Ex to hospital. Nope. Big fat nope. \n\nI know, the woman has brain cancer, I know she might not be able to filter what she is saying. But I think it is shitty to force OP into that situation. The bf needs to care for his daughter, first and foremost. Then the gf. Then the Ex. He can't accommodate all of them.", "You don\u2019t need to take the verbal abuse, but you also need to look at the long term. Are you planning on staying with your bf?  If so then you may want to reconsider your stance. Once the ex passes away, you\u2019ll have to deal with daughter full time. If you abandon her now (which is how she will likely view it) while her mother is dying, say goodbye to any future relationship. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to drop bf, then by all means stop watching the daughter.", "NAH it sucks that you are helping and then get this from T. But, people with brain tumors are literally not in their right mind during episodes like this. Sad situation all around, please continue to support boyfriend and his daughter.", "NAH\n\nI think if the mother starts lashing out, just leave immediately.\n\nIn regards to BF, the thing is if you want this relationship to last, you have to realise that with the mum dying, she will be in your life long term.\n\nIn that respect it would probably be best for you to keep minding the child.\n\nIf you think this is too much for you it might be best for you to make a clean break.\n\nThis kid is going to be traumatised from her mom's death and she will need a lot of support from her dad.", "YWNBTA.\n\nT's prognosis does not justify her abusing you,  particularly in front of her daughter. That's going to poison any relationship you might form with the child.\n\nYour BF saying you would be an AH is an example of blaming the victim. He should be protecting you from abuse. T having received bad news does not excuse her bad behavior.\n\nAt the very, very least, your BF needs to ensure that you never need to see T face to face. If you're willing, you can still watch G, but someone else needs to be responsible for pickup, dropoff, or any other interaction with T.\n\nFrankly, if I were you, I would break up with your boyfriend. If that's what you choose, you will still not be an AH. You've been horribly mistreated, and your boyfriend clearly wants to you put up with continued mistreatment.", "NtA . This is just a small sample of probably the next 2 years minimum of your life. While mom's comments were horrible and uncalled for and it 100% sucks that your boyfriend did not ask her to stop. It's a preview of what's coming. Their child is going to become very very angry after mom passes away and you have to remember that she has already been fed lies about your relationship with her dad. If you're not ready to be the punching bag for your future stepdaughter. Then you have some big decisions to make in your life", "Nta. But I don't see your relationship surviving much longer. I would nope out of that toxic mess. Boyfriend is numb and has no boundaries. Stepkid is using you as an emotional tampon. The ex, if she passes, you will be fighting a ghost with an angry preteen.\n\nSave yourself OP.  Healing wishes to all .", "I might have agreed to help if my partner had a better comment here.  Him making you out to be the asshole is wrong.\n\nThis is awful.  I'm pretty sure the mom has poisoned the kid against you, so that is going to be interesting when your bf gets custody.\n\nIs this what you want for your life?", "NAH. The kid is grieving the imminent loss of her mother; at 10 years old, it must feel like her world is collapsing around her, and she's lashing out. If she were an adult, you wouldn't be obligated to take her crap, but this is a kid whose mother is dying. I think T. has probably poisoned G. against you. \n\nAs painful as it is, I think there is a chance for you to be the bigger person.\n\nHaving said that, she said some vicious things to you, and I can understand that you aren't inclined to help someone, but again, her Mom is dying. However unpleasant her Mom may be to you, that's a horrible thing for a young kid to go through.", "YWBTA. Forget T for a moment. Do you love your BF? Do you want to be with him forever? And what about G?\n\nIf it were me, I would still help with G to help out BF and G, but would avoid all contact with T. They both need your support and this is your time to step up for them.\n\nThat said, stay away from T. She\u2019s angry and grieving her own life. For your mental health, don\u2019t put yourself in the line of fire. It sounds like it\u2019s a situation that won\u2019t last much longer, and then you\u2019re going to have a grieving G and BF (lots of complicated emotions there).\n\nOne day at a time, OP. Just don\u2019t waste the time left being petty while BF and G need you.", "NTA.  Her heartbreaking diagnosis is not an excuse to abuse you.  Your BF should have stepped in and managed the situation.", "NTA but please don't stay in this relationship.", "You WNBTA, but I think you should consider that in a very short time, G is going to be living with you full time, unless some other arrangements are made.  I realize that this behavior predates T's diagnosis, but that issue is going way quickly and G is a young child, terrified about her upcoming loss, already grieving and just voicing what has been said by her very bitter mother.  Please try to find it in your heart to let that go and have sympathy for this child who is going to be a part of your life going forward if you stay with BF.  He's an AH for what he said but he probably is saddened about T's situation (only fair--he had a child with her).  Remember, you're still going to be here and T won't much longer.", "NAH. It's up to you but wouldn't a better boundary be not interacting with T? Your bf's daughter is innocent in all this.", "NTA. You feel disrespected & you want to keep your boundaries. But you should walk away now, because you are not thinking clearly about how this will impact your relationship long-term. Here's a hint - if you die on this hill, it's not going to get any better.", "YWNBTA but you also wouldn't be very kind either. Does she have NO friends or family that could step up? What about his friends and family? Surely you are not THE ONLY choice for childcare? Hell, he can look into hiring a babysitter. After their treatment of you, especially the ex's, I can 100% see why you would want to spare yourself the drama. Then again, brain cancer probably means she's not thinking clearly at all, but then again, she's always been horrible to you. If you take care of the kid some more, remember, you're doing this for him, it's his kid. But if he doesn't try to get someone else to drive her from now on so he takes care of his kid instead, he's absolutely TA. At this point she deserves an uber.", "NTA but you may want to rethink your relationship with your boyfriend.", "NAH - you can feel terrible but woman has brain cancer and is dying, she doesn't think clearly. The girl is just a kid with nearly dead mother and with a lot of predujice from before (I'm sure she heard ugly stuff about you and she believed in it because she is a kid). So - it's a hard one. :(\n\nI suppose now \"house is on fire\" and not the time for arguing. If you really want to be with your guy soon you will have to talk about hard stuff. He won't abandon his kid (I hope!), so your life will be connected to this girl. What then? Therapy? Not living together? What?", "This is such a sad and terrible situation. I feel so bad for you, because it's not your fault. Have you spoken to him calmly to see if he would be able to talk to his daughter, or has he pretty much shut down all of that? It stinks, because on one hand, she is only 10 and about to lose her mother. On the other hand, you are a bystander here, and you're trying to help, only to feel like you're being abused in the process. \n\nSeriously, it's really on your boyfriend to help. If he isn't willing to at least try to get his daughter to stop saying such horrible things to you, then he probably won't when she lives with you full time. \n\nI have to say this isn't an AH situation. Nobody is an AH here. You can't be an AH for not wanting to continually put up with someone being completely disrespectful and hateful toward you, her father isn't an AH per say unless he won't even talk to her about it... It's just a terrible situation and I'm sorry you're in it. I hope it all works out.", "NTA, but I recommend walking away now. This is only going to get worse. G\u2019s hate for you will intensify based on her grief. Op presumably will go from having partial custody to full custody, which is a big change. Also, it can be hard to watch your partner grieve someone who was so nasty to you. She was nasty to you before the tumor.", "YWBTA, this woman is literally dying in the next few weeks. Her whole life literally fell apart and is about to end. Even if she's wrongly lashing out at you, have at least a shred of empathy for the daughter if not her mother. Making your BF's 10 year old go to the appointments and watch her mother die would be cruel.", "NTA. Pretty ungrateful of T. You are helping out and she completely takes a shit on you like that? NTA. I would tell them to hire a babysitter and nope out of that entire relationship/complicated mess. He must be some dude for you to put up with all of this.", "I mean NTA, but how long is this going to go on for? Will the daughter forgive you? Do you go back to babysitting her when mom is dead? Your boyfriend is going to be a full time parent to this kid very soon, so I'd consider what it's going to be like long term.", "NTA\n\nYou did your best to help, until they started biting the hand giving them free childcare.", "Wow, that\u2019s a lot to read and a lot to work through. I don\u2019t think you would be TA necessarily, T is clearly out of pocket. That being said T is a dead women walking and I have no idea what that feels like but I do have sympathy for her. T is having to process losing her LIFE OP, and in her dying mind you are the woman that came to \u201creplace\u201d her in a way. I think that in her mind you are the the person that gets HER ex-husband, and you get HER child, and you get her life while she gets to sit around and wait to die. I feel genuine sorrow thinking about being in her shoes.\n\nThat being said I wanna stress to you that while I have sympathy for T I believe that none of that is your fault. You are not cancer, you are not a home wrecker and you seem to be a very nice person. I can\u2019t imagine the stress you yourself are going through trying to be there for your BF like you have been. I\u2019m sorry you are being blamed for problems you did not create, and are being guilted by a dying women for being the next women. It is hard to say what I would do in your shoes, I would like to think that I would be the bigger person and continue to watch G, but I am also a human and can only deal with so much myself. \n\nIn the end I don\u2019t think you would be TA for not watching G, but I personally would say to try and keep it up IF YOU CAN. If you can\u2019t continue it don\u2019t feel bad, this was never your fight and you have done a great job of supporting people through it. T, G, your BF and you are all currently going through something that is incredibly traumatizing. T has to deal with dying, G has to lose her mother incredibly young. Your BF is losing a former partner and a co parent, trying to support his daughter, trying to support his daughters mother and trying to support you, while having to rationalize being an only parent and your just tangled into the mess trying to do the right thing whatever that may be. It may be because I have one on the way now but this whole situation literally has me in tears.", "I'm going to say NAH\n\nThe woman is dying and under a lot of stress. I'll give her a stress pass bit at the same time you don't deserve to put up with abuse.\n\nIf you do decide not to babysit that's OK. If you do decide to babysit you can make clear to your boyfriend that it's his job to ensure no contact between you and his ex.", "This is a terrible situation all around. I will say that a woman is dying and just found out she won\u2019t ever see her daughter grow up and is definitely jealous that you will. Plus as many have pointed out brain tumor affects personality. And while nobody deserves to be treated with disrespect, empathy goes a long way. If it was me, I\u2019d still be helpful as possible for my bf sake, as if the situation was reversed I\u2019d want him to be there for me. But no, I don\u2019t think YTA, just in a tough situation.", "NTA. If she wants to have this negative energy before she dies then that\u2019s her problem. Just be prepared this might not be the relationship for you. There is too much drama and I think it will get worse after the ex does. Not just for the daughter but also your bf from how much he still cared about his ex.", "NTA. I\u2019ve worked with patients on hospice for months now. Dying is not an excuse for lashing out at people. It\u2019s an apparent inevitability in her case. While it may be difficult for her to come to terms with it, dying should not ever be an excuse to be an AH. \n\nYour boyfriend should have firmly and politely stood up for you. He didn\u2019t, and perhaps he just didn\u2019t care. Maybe you guys need to have some difficult conversations about boundaries and parenting.", "What an incredibly hard situation. I understand that you don't fancy baby sitting her again but i think that under the current circumstances and her mother dying in weeks it would be best to be the bigger person for now and babysit. If you refuse to babysit her I think  you only make her resent you more and escalate the whole situation even more. \n\nI would say you would not be TA if you did not babysit (depending on how disrespectful she was) but I would highly suggest being the bigger person, cut her some slack(cause her mom is dying) and just babysit.", "YTA. She just found out she is dying soon and she behaved badly. Who will have custody of her child after her death? Dad, right? So you want to alienate him and his daughter now because a dying woman behaved badly? Have a little compassion and be the bigger person.", "Her mother is dying, have a little empathy. It\u2019s not okay she said that, but right now is not the time. She must be experiencing more negative feelings than she knows what to do with, and needs you to be the adult. But you need to decide what you want. If you stay in this relationship, you need to be ready to be a step-mother to a very traumatised child, which means much more than baby sitting. This is what it means to share your life with someone who has a child. If you don\u2019t want that, say it now and leave your boyfriend alone; or maybe stick around to help out for a bit, so you don\u2019t abandon him in the midst of the worst time of their lives, but then leave the two of them alone to grieve and move on. Don\u2019t create more drama. Anything else and YWBTA.\n\nEdit: just re-read and realised the mother said those things. While it\u2019s horrible, this woman just found out she\u2019s dying; your boyfriend found out the mother of his child is dying; both these things are much more serious than what happened to you, and you should not withhold support right now, if you truly care for him. This woman will be gone soon, so bury her resentment along with her.", "YWNBTA. You shouldn't have to take abuse and cruelty from her or their daughter just because she's sick and that's a fair boundary to set. That being said, you can stand up to her and make clear that her behavior is unacceptable without putting your BF in a shitty position of not having childcare while his daughter's mother is dying. It's a complicated situation clearly and you have absolutely every right to refuse to put up with abuse, but there could also be a much better way to move forward with this.", "Nta. I think you should leave. Your bf clearly has a lot of baggage and he did not defend you. But if you choose to stay and support him with this I think you should babysit G. She is about to lose her mother and needs as much support as she can get from her support system, and if you stay that is what you will be.", "In my opinion, YTBH. You entered into a relationship with a man that you knew had a child with an ex-wife that he chose to remain close to. If you didn't want the responsibility of watching a child, you shouldn't have shacked up with a man who has one. Yes, what the ex-wife said wasn't right; I am not excusing her of that, but I can only guess how stressful going through chemo and knowing that your death is imminent is. If you were in her situation, I am sure that you would want to know that your child was being well cared for. So I would suggest letting it go. It doesn't make what she said okay, but it sets you free from the prison of unforgiveness and bitterness. If you choose to remain with him, you need to accept his daughter; if you can't do that, I think you should move on. Let him find someone who will accept him and his daughter fully. That's just my two cents.", "Im going to say YWBTA I'm afraid\n\nT is quite possibly dying and is scared.  Its not fair how she has treated you in the past but this is probably not a time where she is thinking straight.  She is scared she is leaving her daughter behind which must be hard.\n\nFor G its even worse.  She is only young and sees how sick her mother is and is worried about losing her.  She is lashing out and you are in the firing line.\n\nI know its hard but I'm sure you can empathise with them as its the worst time for them at the moment.", "Nta but everyone else is", "NAH\n\nThe Ex being upset and taking it out on you might be excused.  But your BF not saying something isn't okay.  \n\nAlso, your BF is definitely going to expect you to help care for his daughter going forward.  And he's not going to be emotionally available for a relationship with you while dealing with his grief.\n\nDon't babysit again.  Your BF can find someone else.  And start figuring out how you're going to exit this relationship.", "Nta. You may want to think how hard the future will be. No one can compete with the dead. Horrible people become saint. Good luck op!", "YWBTA, the woman is either dying or believes that she is dying, and her family and child believe the same thing.\n\nYou either step up and do everything you can to help your boyfriend and his child or you leave the relationship completely.\nThings are very hard for your boyfriend and his daughter right now and they are going to get a lot worse before they get better, if you aren't going to be there for them now they certainly aren't going to have you after.", "Hmm, sounds like a rock and a hard place for you. On the one hand, T has just found out she's only got weeks to live. That will surely mess with anybody's mind and emotions, and it appears that you were a convenient target. Unless BF is a licensed counselor or has already gone through this experience with someone else, he doesn't really know how to respond in this situation, so I might cut him some slack here. You have not mentioned whether or not T has any other support besides BF - family, friends, etc. Can't any of them babysit G? Why does it have to be you? If you DO decide to be compassionate and forgiving in the light of the current situation and continue to watch G for a couple more weeks, you would be an angel. While your comment was toxic, as well, I understand how you feel about the constant toxicity you face from T. In that regard, soft YTA \n\nNow then, if you plan on staying with your BF after T dies, you and he will need some serious counseling for several reasons. T is a person who has been in BF's life for a long time, and regardless of the fact that the marriage didn't last, he will be grieving her. You may need help to support him in his grief. If G comes to live with her daddy, your BF, y'all are going to need help navigating G's attitude towards and beliefs about you. I wish you good luck!", "YTA  - It's not ok for her to be so hurtful towards you, regardless of the circumstances.  Just because she's dying doesn't mean you need to be subjected to her abuse.  That said,  her daughter has nothing to do with any of this and doesn't deserve to be punished.\n\nIf you break up with him, you're free.  You have no responsibility to him, or his daughter.  That's your out.  You do not, however, get to try and maintain a relationship with him, while not also sharing the responsibility of child-care for his daughter, especially in the middle of an event as traumatic as this is for his daughter.  To even consider this is cruelty on equal footing to her treatment of you.", "There NAH but also no one in the right. This is a very complicated situation with lots of feelings. If you value your relationship, do continue to help and babysit. This won't be just for the sake of the dying person, but for the kid. The daughter may not realize it now but will in the future that you were there for her when she was going through a really bad time.\nYou can be upset at your bf but know he's between a rock and his kids mom dying. You can limit your contact with the ex as much as possible. You can be the bigger person and also just forgive her, preferably in from off the daughter. Hell is you do talk to the ex again, and she lashes out, tell her you don't wish her dead and that you'd rather have her in your life even if it's never on good terms than have her daughter without a mother. Just let her know you want to help too but you can't if she doesn't want it.\nDo what you feel is best for you.", "I'm not saying you're the a**hole, I'm not saying she T is either. T is dying and will not get to see her child grow up, get married, go off to college, meet her grandkids or anything. T is lashing out and is very hurt. The kindest thing you can do is let it go and try to be there for your bf and G. G needs stability right now and is probably feeling abandoned, your bf is trying and honestly for everyone's sake you should let this go. You can tell him how you feel but she's already down and him fighting with her over this will make it worse for everyone. Do what you think is best for your bf and his child. Especially if you want to be in their lives long term", "NTA but seriously--this woman is DYING and her brain is compromised by cancer.  Are you completely heartless?  This child is about to lose her mother--that is where your thoughts need to be right now.  How you behave in the next few weeks will have a lasting impact on your relationship with your boyfriend.", "Time to have a frank talk with T. She's leaving this earth soon and her daughter will need every ounce of love she can get.  Does she want to see her daughter at peace with a woman who's willing to love her or is she setting up daughter to have a hateful lifelong ugly anger at someone who's trying to help.  Her answer will tell you what you're future looks like. \n\nI still wouldn't refuse to babysit and instead make that time to help daughter make gifts for mom.  In the long run, she'll remember your kindness during her terrible loss. If T holds on to that anger, just leave.  No use fighting with the dying in my book. \n\nYWBTA is you refuse to babysit.  You might be all she's got very soon.", "I will just leave this here\n\nhttps://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/living-with-a-brain-tumour/side-effects/personality-changes/", "YTA\n\n\"When we got home I lost it with him and told him I wouldn't keep his daughter any longer, not if he allowed T to talk to me in such a manner.\n\nHe said I'd be a huge asshole if I went through with this because T has just found she's only got few weeks left and not the months she'd previously thought.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but\n\nthere are *so many* other things you could do, even very \"inappropriate\" things, to express your anger and outrage, that don't involve bringing undue suffering to their daughter. And there are lots of other things you could do to avoid T while still babysitting their daughter. Asking for your boyfriend to correct an ex-wife who has weeks to live is asking for a lot, he would probably rather take weeks of verbal abuse from you. I would think differently if this were not the first time a problem occurred during this arrangement. But it was, so you've got other ways to set limits and respect yourself, or (frankly) a few weeks to stew. I would also answer differently if she had months rather than weeks to live.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

T and I never did get on well. I met my BF while he was in the proceedings of their divorce, and I think she's always thought we had an affair long before then.\n\nShe hates me a lot, and so does G. I've been called a home-wrecker, a slut and other nice things ever since I first met them.\n\nNow, my BF is usually very quick to shut down their bullshit, but he adores his daughter and still cares about ex-wife (they've been together 15 years, and been friends since their childhood).\n\nEver since the diagnosis, he's been the one driving ex-wife to medical appointments and such, and he's asked me the favor to look after his daughter while he's with T.\n\nHe knows what a huge favour it is (he's thanked me profusely every time) and I know how much he needs my help.\n\nEverything went to shit a few hrs ago, when I was asked to bring G back to her mother's house.\n\nT started saying I must be glad she's dying, because I can keep BF to myself now. She said I must be happy, because now I get to keep her daughter and pretend she's mine.\n\nShe said a lot of ugly things, and BF didn't do anything to correct her. \n\nI stayed really quiet, because to be frank I was incredibly shocked. Still am, tbh.\n\nWhen we got home I lost it with him and told him I wouldn't keep his daughter any longer, not if he allowed T to talk to me in such a manner. \n\nHe said I'd be a huge asshole if I went through with this because T has just found she's only got few weeks left and not the months she'd previously thought.\n\nIs he right? WIBTA if I stopped babysitting his daughter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "NTA. He let her abuse you. F him", "No YWNBTA. \n\nT was rude to you before her Dx. So was G. Your BF has apparently never effectively intervened on your behalf with T or G, because their behavior persists, and is now using the fact that T is in the end stages of her disease as a reason why you should not only continue to accept her vitriol but accept the highly escalated version.\n\n I'd nope on outta there. Surely T or your BF  have family & close friends who can watch G, or your STBX BF can call hospice services to deal with some of the tasks which are falling to him and free himself up for parenting his daughter as she loses her mother.\n\nEDIT:clarity", "When Mom dies, big old guess where that child will be living full time. Might as well leave now", "NTA Why is your bf okay with you being abused? Apparently, there are times when he's thinks you should just take it. This abusive behavior really shows boths character. Is the daughter going to start where her mother leaves off? You teach people how to treat you. Protect yourself.", "A soft YWBTA. \n\nTell your boyfriend that if you're to continue to watch the little one that you're not having anything to do with the mother. He can ferry the little girl from your car to the house and house to your car, but you're not going in. This is to save both mom and you from having to see one another and keeping hurt feelings apart.", "What he should've done is apologized to you immediately on her behalf.  Maybe he didn't want to stop her from saying those things to avoid her getting into a worse state.", "Gentle YTA.  You\u2019ve got a lot of great comments here already. Obviously it\u2019s a tough situation for everybody. But I see from a response or two you say that there really isn\u2019t any other options realistically to babysit the daughter. It sounds like you are basically saying they should hire a babysitter over these next couple weeks because you won\u2019t do this favor that you are considering to be for the mother.   If your boyfriend is insisting on taking the mother to chemo, and that of course is an entirely different subject but he may feel obligated to spend his last few weeks with her and that\u2019s understandable, but I think it\u2019s going to have lifelong ramifications for both your relationship and the daughters emotional health to know that you refused to do this for them in the last couple weeks and asked them to hire a stranger while you I guess theoretically sit around the house not doing anything instead. The optics of that is worse than the vitriol the ex is hurling at you.   One, she\u2019s a jealous ex and two, she\u2019s dying. Neither of those are excuses, but in this case they are reasons. Also I can tell you my mother\u2018s cancer eventually got to her brain as well at the end and in her last few months she would say bizarre things. I understand you said the ex has always been crappy to you and I get that, but hearing that she\u2019s dying and possibly the brain tumor itself causing her to say bad things and you\u2019re the target might just be something you just have to be the bigger person and ignore right now. If you can\u2019t bear to do this woman a favor I get it but you don\u2019t do it for her do it for your boyfriend and his daughter,who will be in your life obviously even more going forward after her mother dies.   if you\u2019re thinking about breaking up with your boyfriend do it now but if you think you\u2019re gonna be trying to stick it out during and after this, then do this", "YWBTA if you stopped babysitting.  You're doing that to help your BF and he really needs your support right now.  Refusing to interact with T again would be an appropriate response to the situation.  Your BF can come outside to meet you when you bring G back to your mother's house, it's the best solution for everybody.", "Yea this entire situation sucks and while it wasn't right she's literally dying and odds are great she's terrified. It's not fair to take out on you but but she's looking at you like you want her title as mom.

It's totally ok to step away from this relationship but if you see a future for yourself with your BF, G is going to be a part of it. You're going to need to find a way to move forward with her.

She has no obligation to watch her but did so anyway even knowing the child also hated her.

I\u2019m not saying what she said was okay or that OP should have to stick around to keep hearing it. But I also feel like those kinda of statements have less to do with respect and more to do with a traumatized child being scared out of her mind. She\u2019s about to have no mother, a father who she now sees can happily easily and quickly replace family members he\u2019s displeased with, and a stepmother who hates her. She\u2019s wrestling with feelings that even grown adults struggle with, when she should be learning her times tables.  If she were abandoned she\u2019d be boned\u2014she doesn\u2019t have the option of moving out and getting a job if her dad decides to go play happy families with the new woman. \n\nI feel like IF op decides to stay and try to build a relationship with this girl, that would be doable. These accusations are less things she thinks are true and more things she\u2019s AFRAID are true, and I would bet that a time frame of gentle reassurances that \u201cof course I would never want that, I care about you and I\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d would produce very different behavior in a year or two. But thats a LOT to ask from anyone and no one could fault OP for not wanting to put in that kind of time or effort. \n\nThe fight you absolutely WON\u2019T win though is  trying to pit the girl against her father. \u201cShe HAS to treat me with adult level respect and affection or else you should punish her\u201d is just going to push everyone further apart.

He needed to shut it down, especially since she was verbally abusing you. Dying or not never gives anyone the right to abuse someone who is actually helping them out.\n\nI recommend you evaluate your relation with this said BF. He lets his ex verbally abuse. He lets his daughter verbally abuse you. And this was long before the ex was dying. Do you like being verbally abused?

If you want to continue a relationship with this man, you are going to have to make peace with his daughter because eventually, you may become her stepmother. If you refuse to babysit, he may decide that you do not love him enough to care for his child and break up with you. The best thing you can do is to say to her that you know that she doesn't like you, that you are sorry that her Mom is sick and that you have to watch her so she will be safe while her Mom gets her treatments.

She\u2019s being abusive to you and your boyfriend is just letting her.\n\nIn a month she will be dead. What then? You make it sound like her daughter is already poisoned against you and repeating her mothers diatribes against you. What is your boyfriend going to say when your daughter calls you those names to both your faces? If past is prologue, he is going to let her abuse you too. She will be traumatized, so sad about her mom, reason after reason after reason that he will just let her call you names. Just like he\u2019s doing right now with her mom.\n\nIt\u2019s a messy situation, but you need to figure out what boundaries you are willing to deal with here.

If you make the last few weeks of her mom's life worse you will NEVER come back from that! Also if you really love your boyfriend you should suck it up and support him - the mother of his child is dying, and he is there watching this is likely the worst part of both their lives... Don't make it worse \n\nOn the other hand. ...

Also depending on where the tumour is located it can cause awful outbursts or a lack of filter, personality changes, or even steroids and the chemotherapy can cause personality changes. \n\nEven in the most happiest of families I have seen verbal aggressive outbursts from the the patient towards their loved ones, I always try to prep families for the uncomfortable moments that will always come.

Especially since she'll be dead in a few weeks and never ever to take those words back.\n\nThis is all on bf allowing this to happen.\n\nFrankly, this was a nail in the relationship coffin. There's no recovering this for the better.  Not even with therapy. OP is forever a monster in the daughter's eyes and it was already being cemented before this outburst.\n\nIt's time to make peace and move on.

But the relationship is over.", "I fully agree with you.\n\nI just want to add. OP seems particularly hurt that BF didn't say anything. And for that I think she is 100% right. During or after he should have said something. He saw someone insult OP viciously and did nothing. Brain tumor makes people say things sometimes, I know, but he still could have said something. If not right then at least after being with her alone something like \"I am so sorry you had to hear that, she is having these types of episodes because of the tumor. She was extremely rude and I apologize for not saying anything. I didn't because xyz.\" \n\nI know he is hurting too, but OP is taking hit after hit and he calls her an AH.", "Agree with this.  I would add, though, that bf is wrong not to step up to protect OP from the abuse in some way.  I get this situation is awful and difficult for him, but he isn\u2019t helping his own relationship with you or your relationship with G by not doing anything about T\u2019s badmouthing you.  \n\nMaybe one solution is to say to bf that you will watch G (which I think you should for all the reasons in the parent comment above), but he needs to talk to T and let her know that kind of talk is neither fair nor acceptable.  And if she does that to you again and he says nothing, you will calmly but firmly inform T that while you appreciate she is ill and you cannot imagine what it\u2019s like for her, that does not give her license to treat you badly and you are not going to stay for it.  Then you leave.  \n\nIf he won\u2019t stick up for you, let him know that you see he\u2019s made his choices, and you will make yours, whatever that means for you.", "Sorry but from the post the ex has been treating OP like this all along from before she got sick. The only thing that changed is her bf does not have her back anymore.  This relationship is over. If she takes the abuse she will blame the bf and if she does not the bf will blame her. And don't forget the daughter heard her mom and may even hate OP more. So it's over.", "This should be top comment.", "Exactly. Kid hated OP before the diagnosis as she sees her as the reason mom& dad aren't together. Then there's ex-wife who already hated her before and now even more (maybe because of brain tumor). Once mom passes away, do you think the kid will magically love OP? If anything it will get worse. And BF will not stand up for OP because his child, who will have just lost her mother, will come first and that's understandable. So OP is doomed to be last and a punching bag pretty much forever...\n\nGet out while she can.\n\nNTA. It's unfortunate what they are going through but since the hate and verbal abuse came before the diagnosis, I can't go with N A H. OP has a duty to protect herself first.", "I kinda agree with you in certain things (except the judgment), but I feel like I would agree more if BF had done something or had talked to OP about what happened. He saw someone insult OP viciously and did nothing. Brain tumor makes people say things sometimes, I know, but he still could have said something. If not right then at least after being with her something like \"I am so sorry you had to hear that, she is having these types of episodes because of the tumor. She was extremely rude and I apologize for not saying anything. I didn't because xyz.\" \n\nAlso, she had contact with T because she was asked to drop G there, it wasn't a choice.", "T was the one that lashed out.", "So OP needs to sacrifice her own mental health and be an emotional punching bag?", "The only thing I\u2019ll add as a possibility, is that the brain cancer may have gone undetected and caused personality changes before diagnoses. Not saying it did, just that in some cases it can.", "Your suggestion for what OP's bf should have said to OP afterward is good, but he absolutely should have stopped T from saying the things she was saying, told her that what she was saying was both untrue and unkind, and told her that such behavior from her was absolutely unacceptable and would not be tolerated by *either of them.*", "Absolutely. Excellent points, all.", "I don't think the hell that's about to happen has sunk in for the OP yet.\n\nThis situation as is will only be this way for another few weeks. And then the OP's boyfriend is going to be, correctly, diverting his time and energy toward his grieving child. And he'll likely have some grief of his own to work there. These two people will, rightfully, be spending a lot of time together. The OP's boyfriend is not going to have a lot of emotional energy left over for the OP. He will probably also prioritize his grieving child for a while.\n\nSo the OP will have to figure out: What does supporting her boyfriend look like here? How important is it to her to show up for her boyfriend and his daughter? And what will happen if she chooses to disengage right when her boyfriend might want some emotional and logistical support? This is a guy who is about to become a single dad with 100% custody, no co-parent to take the kid on weekends. He will need help.\n\nIt's a really tough situation. The OP needs to be honest with herself as to whether or not she is willing to be in it.", "T had been rude before yes but bf always shut it down. He didn't this time because he probably was still in shock of finding out his best friend, first love and mother of his child will most definitely die and only has weeks left. No one is the A H here, it's such a complicated situation. OP's feelings are valid, but if she wants to be with the boyfriend, she'll need to let this go and be there for them 100% because it's about to be the challenge of a lifetime for all involved (T dying, bf and G grieving, G moving in permanently with dad, OP building a true relationship with G with the ups and downs, etc)", "I think the kid did too, as I read it.", "Explain to your boyfriend that while his daughter might be familiar with you, having her associate losing her mother with you taking care of her is not good either. \n\nThe likelihood is high his daughter will resent you, through no fault of her own, but because she missed and grieves her Mum, and you being there when her Mum isn\u2019t may in her mind become you taking her away from her Mum. That\u2019s not good for her, for you, or your boyfriend. \n\nWhile I sympathise with why his ex lashed out, and I can\u2019t imagine getting more bad news on top of her already bad diagnoses, she was out of line. She no doubt hates that she won\u2019t be around to see her daughter grow up and you were the easiest target for her own grief. Which is another reason for you to not be the daughter\u2019s support person here. \n\nDo whatever you can to support your boyfriend. Be willing to provide food and just be there. \nBut I think it\u2019s honestly best for you all to not be involved with his ex and daughter right now. Your bf means well, but it\u2019s causing damage.", "Yes, you are right.  I had to re-read and I think I tripped over what was said about G hating her too.  Either way, T isn't long for this world.  BF is an AH for not shutting T down, but I suspect he may be struggling with how to push back against someone who is literally dying in front of him.", "G won't let you? Did you really just say that about a 10 yo girl whose mother is dying? I don't know if OP is the A H but you most definitely are", "And if her personality changes are what caused the divorce and the bf realizes this, then that's just a giant heap of guilt for him and his relationship with OP. I don't see this relationship ever turning stable between guilt from bf and dislike, loathing or unacceptable along with cryshing grief from G.\nNTA OP.", "OP isn't talking about the daughter though. She's upset about what the ex-wife said to her.", "The person saying the awful things is the dying mom in front of the daughter, not the daughter.", "The ex wife is the one that said everything, not the daughter.", "@mitsuhachi I think you're confused. The daughter didn't say these things, the mother did", "Good points", "This, right here. Beautifully stated!", "Um... that is how brain cancer works. My uncle was laughing and enjoying Christmas Eve with the family, playing card games and making jokes. The next morning he couldn't talk right. He had aphasia caused by two tumors in his brain. Over the next 8 months, through surgeries and radiation treatments, my uncle just kind of faded away. The last time I saw him was three weeks before he died. He was just a shell of a body that kept going on autopilot. My uncle wasn't there anymore. \n\nBrain cancer can absolutely change a person overnight.", "Yeah I wondered about all that too. It\u2019s a hard situation for everyone.", "T was already verbally abusive towards OP before the cancer.", "All that is fine and understandable but OP shouldn't be the emotional rehab center of nobody. It's not her mom or her relative. It's the daughter of a woman who hates her, a daughter who hates her herself, and the only link is a man she loves but is doing fuck all to defend her. Once his child loses her mother, do you think is gonna get better? Of course not. \n\nI'm not saying they are assholes. But this relationship is doomed unless OP accepts to be a punching bag for the next few years.", "Honestly the kid is probably better off without OP in the picture right now.", "Excellent comment and so very, very true.", "Last summer my otherwise lovely Uncle started acting erratic. Starting with being absolutely insulting to everyone and culminating to him giving his car away to a random Uber driver. He had been acting like a jerk for months\u2026 guess what, inoperable Brain Tumor and he died of brain cancer in November. Much like dementia, they have an ability to completely alter someone\u2019s personality\u2026which is controlled by your brain. This take is just genuinely so stupid I think you may be a literal child if you can\u2019t understand that.", "You know you're effectively saying alzheimers isn't an excuse to be forgetful right. You're the real A H here."]}
