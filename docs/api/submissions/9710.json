You life was just as valuable as his. \n\nYou are not malicious or uncaring. Your decisions are based on sound reasons. Your parents did your brother a disservice by not introducing him into free/or fee programs that could coach him to be prepared for independent (supervised) living. These programs include behavior modifications, skill building, ensuring his safety, etc.  LIVE your best life. Money from the sale will not erase the past but it may take care of you and the ones you love.", "NTA. What I'm not hearing here is why he can't live with your aunt then, or anyone else in your DMs. You've got very valid reasons for not wanting him living with you or your kids.", "NTA. If you are in the US look into SCL waiver through Medicaid. Apply now because it has a long wait list but he could live in a regular house with 2 or 3 other people with a caregiver. The cost is part of his check and the rest is offset by Medicaid. Places like that do day program, go on vacations, learn life skills, and outings. I deal with that clientele in my line of work and most of them live a good life with nice things. He would qualify since he has an intellectual disability.", "If aunt is so worried, she can give him a home", "NTA.  You are putting your immediate family first, as you should.  Send one group text inviting everybody that is giving you crap to step up and take care of your brother.  Then block every damn one of them.", "NTA You have to take care of your family. As somebody who works in a system  I would like to make some suggestions. Start looking into them now because the process does not happen overnight. When you decide which group homes you would like to look at go to your states, website of the agency that overseas group homes and look at their licensing reviews for the last few years. You can learn a lot from those as to whether or not your brother will be well taken care of, and his needs met. I know that you may not be in a position that you can visit him frequently but please do so as much as possible and maintain contact with the group home manager and staff. Residents who have families who show interest and keep in contact tend to have better treatment than those who don\u2019t. If the staff know that they will be held accountable, they will respond accordingly. You might want to consider becoming his court ordered guardian, that would mean any changes in his care, medication\u2018s, spending of his money in large amounts, will absolutely have to be approved by you. If your father is able, and there is a monetary inheritance that will be going to your brother, it needs to be placed in a trust that is specifically designed for persons with disabilities. Otherwise the state can take that money to provide for his care in the group home.", "NTA, it really is your decision and it is always very easy for someone else to say you should look after your brother. But to you he is your bully/attacker, even though he may or may not be able to help it, he is a potential danger to your daughters, so I totally understand your decision. If you find the right group home for him, where he will be happy and looked after, then I think that is a reasonable compromise.", "NTA - even without the abuse history, taking care of your brother would be quite the undertaking that you can\u2019t do without fully committing to it; you\u2019re under no obligation.

You are under no obligation to care for your sibling... especially if he was abusive in the past. As a parent of someone on the spectrum, I have no intention of ever forcing my one son to care for the other in any way.

You are not required to do for your brother what your parents would not do for him, nor are you obligated to care for the family that put you in foster just to make their lives easier. (Like, what!?) Protect you and protect yours!", "NTA. Those group homes can be nasty, to be sure, but you're also not obligated to expose yourself and your kids to abuse. And if he has the mind of a 16yearold he should be capable of not being abusive.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing what is necessary to care for yourself and your family. Further, social security and Medicaid rules can be incredibly strict, and providing your brother with finances can jeopardize his ability to receive the support he is entitled to.\n\nIt sounds like you have family more interested in pointing out you are doing things wrong than they are interested in actually helping you or your brother.\n\nMy assumption is that while you need to make these tough and necessary decisions, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will cut your brother out of your life or leave him completely unsupported.", "Info: Did your parents leave anything to your brother? Will you be his legal guardian once your father passes away?", "Lol, your aunt is mad because you\u2019re holding it against him, that he abused you so bad that you were put into foster care despite having two present parents. Is she insane? Of course you\u2019d hold that against him, it\u2019s called learning the hard way that your brother is not to be trusted and not allowing him to abuse your children too. Your aunt is on another planet here, she just doesn\u2019t want to take him because a 45 year old, violent, mentally handicapped man is a LOT to deal with.

Your children come first.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your family did you and him such a disservice. Where was your aunt when you were in foster care? She\u2019s a disgrace.", "NTA - Sounds like an awful upbringing and you need to protect your children if introducing him would put them in any danger. Is it good to take care of family, of course but you have to prioritize you children first.", "NTA", "NTA in the least.  Given you have been physically harmed by your brother previously and you now have young children, your first obligation is to your children, not your brother.

Ask any of those pricks who are bad-mouthing you why they aren't stepping up and offering to take your brother in. \n\nYou aren't responsible for him because he is your brother.  That is your father's job.  If he hasn't set things up so that your brother is looked after and assumed you would do it, that isn't your problem, you have your own life and family to take care of.  \n\nYour brother should *already* have been in care.

When do you think you\u2019ll be able to meet me at a lawyers office to sign over all the paperwork?\u2019 \n\nAnd then when they let you know that that\u2019s not  what they meant and that they can\u2019t do that and it\u2019s your responsibility.

It's that he's also an addict and that he has behavioural issues that you can't help him with.\n\nYou are finding a suitable situation for him where he will be cared for and get support for his issues. That is literally taking care of him. If your extended family or anyone else has an issue with that, then they can take him in.", "NTA. Your children come first.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want to have a (possibly) violent middle-aged alcoholic man living with you and your children. Your duty is to your own children first and foremost.

NTA. This sounds a bit like something that happened in my family. My uncle was mentally disabled. His parents expected my father to always be there for him if needed. He lived with his mom (my grandma) but my dad was often called to help. My father died before the uncle and there were a lot of talks about what to do once my grandma passes away. \n\nThe point is that it's a difficult situation but your aunt is making it more difficult and guilt tripping you.

Ask her why your kids should be at risk of she won't take any", "Your aunt's a fucking hypocrite", "Check out the other roommates though. Sometimes they can be a bit troublesome", "jfc", "That\u2019s a vile thing to say. He\u2019s autistic, it doesn\u2019t mean he should die Jesus", "It sounds as if my advice wasn\u2019t needed, you are on top of things! Best wishes!", "Then I would go for it! Don't worry about what they others say. They never walked into your shoes, so what do they know. :-)", "Oh she 100% would. She actually asked and I said after I have the walk through with the inspector and everyone else I'll get back to you. When I did she wanted it for below half the quoted price because of the poor condition.", "NTA. You have your own life and kids to think of.", "You don't owe anyone an apology or an explanation. You have dealt with the consequences of his actions your entire life and you no longer have to do it. \n\nYou're not responsible for your brother, that was your parents responsibility and they failed to prepare for this eventuality.\n\nBlock anyone that is harassing you and give them nothing. Go NC if you have to because they sound toxic. Look after you and your children. Just remember that you matter too, and don't feel guilty about putting yourself first.", "Yeah, it's difficult. I am highly biased because I basically lost my dad through this, I feel. You are not abandoning your brother. It is horrible that your aunt guilt trips you into it. Like others said, why doesn't she live with him?", "Honestly he's still getting the better end of the deal with the condition of the house.", "Or guilt inheritance! \n\nI think N T A, but if it's been bequeathed on the basis of OP looking after her brother, then that's a different story, and misleading of OP in her post.", "Then defo NTA \n\nIf it's your Mother's house, and your Father's son, I suppose he wouldn't be entitled to the home at all.", "100% NTA and those family members texting you need to stop trying to guilt you into something they are unwilling to do. Given the harm he caused you as a child and his current substance issues, he would pose a huge risk to your children - end of. There is no way you can have him in your home. You would be irresponsible if you did. I was a little on the fence about selling the house to keep the money while placing him in a state home, but you've addressed all that. It's his only option. And he received $7,000 from your parents' estate. You're also helping with all the caseworker/estate/trust issues. \n\nYou have every right to tell your family that if they would like to more for him, they can, otherwise, you have fulfilled your obligations. They need to stop emotionally harassing you. \n\nYou deserve the benefits of your inheritance.", " He is never going to be independent.", " \nIt is not your brother's responsibility to take care of them.", " \nMaybe you can set aside some money for her from the sale of the house because it's your parents' inheritance but other than that you haven't given them anything to focus your family on.", "If your state has assisted suicide I\u2019d ask him if he wants it.", "The house is in such poor condition we would barely get anything for it anyway too. It's almost uninhabitable. It would cost so much money to fix it.", "It's his drinking and \"fits\"", "\u201cBecause thee not me!\u201d", "What the fuck is wrong with you. Actual question.", "Wtf", "Dude, I hope you're joking. If not, I have to agree with literally everyone else. What the fuck.", "Do they know the situation with the house in the condition it's in? If they're so concerned, they can buy the house from you and fix it themselves. \n\nOp, I think it would be best to just sell it, put your brother in a group home that will actually help him (like you planned) and cut contact with anyone who has qualms about it", "That didn\u2019t really answer the question though. Ask her, \u201cif you\u2019re unwilling to deal with it, why do you think I should?\u201d", "They do. It's why they avoid going to their house. Its why I can't go in their because the smell and whatever else my eyes water and swell and i start wheezing. I've tried to get my dad in a nursing home and or have a aid come and help but because at the time he was of \"sound mind and awareness\" my hands were tied."]}
