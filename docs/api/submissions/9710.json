He is in the hospital due to serious health complications so the topic came up about the house and my older brother. It didn't end so well. \n\nMy brother is 45 and autistic but functional when he's being monitored by my dad or caseworker. He basically has the brain of a 16 year old. When asked what I plan on doing with the house by my aunt I said I plan on selling it because it was not in the best state because my dad and brother did not keep up with it and me and my partner can't afford to fix it or keep it. She asked what about my brother and I said I'm going to help him get in a group home with the state but he can not live with us or in the house. When asked why he can't live with us I said because I can't handle him and my girls and don't feel comfortable with him around my children since he was one of the biggest reasons I had to grow up and age out of in foster care. My parents didn't protect me from his outbursts and abuse and I got hurt badly among the neglect and abuse I went through because they were so focused on him. My aunt accused me of holding that against him and called me cold and heartless. Well now I'm being flooded with texts and DMs about how horrible and selfish I am for throwing my autistic brother to the side and selling his home. They refuse to hear me out.\n\nMy partner said I'm doing what's best not only financially but also for our family and for him and me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I've been asked why the house wasn't split evenly. It was my mom's house and she left it to me after my dad started selling other assets that were supposed to go to me to pay off debts and to support my brother. He'll be getting a cash inheritance of $7,000 and heirlooms that are worth and was appraised for a couple more thousand of dollars.

You life was just as valuable as his. \n\nYou are not malicious or uncaring. Your decisions are based on sound reasons. Your parents did your brother a disservice by not introducing him into free/or fee programs that could coach him to be prepared for independent (supervised) living. These programs include behavior modifications, skill building, ensuring his safety, etc.  LIVE your best life. Money from the sale will not erase the past but it may take care of you and the ones you love.", "NTA. What I'm not hearing here is why he can't live with your aunt then, or anyone else in your DMs. You've got very valid reasons for not wanting him living with you or your kids.", "NTA. If you are in the US look into SCL waiver through Medicaid. Apply now because it has a long wait list but he could live in a regular house with 2 or 3 other people with a caregiver. The cost is part of his check and the rest is offset by Medicaid. Places like that do day program, go on vacations, learn life skills, and outings. I deal with that clientele in my line of work and most of them live a good life with nice things. He would qualify since he has an intellectual disability.", "If aunt is so worried, she can give him a home", "NTA.  You are putting your immediate family first, as you should.  Send one group text inviting everybody that is giving you crap to step up and take care of your brother.  Then block every damn one of them.", "NTA You have to take care of your family. As somebody who works in a system  I would like to make some suggestions. Start looking into them now because the process does not happen overnight. When you decide which group homes you would like to look at go to your states, website of the agency that overseas group homes and look at their licensing reviews for the last few years. You can learn a lot from those as to whether or not your brother will be well taken care of, and his needs met. I know that you may not be in a position that you can visit him frequently but please do so as much as possible and maintain contact with the group home manager and staff. Residents who have families who show interest and keep in contact tend to have better treatment than those who don\u2019t. If the staff know that they will be held accountable, they will respond accordingly. You might want to consider becoming his court ordered guardian, that would mean any changes in his care, medication\u2018s, spending of his money in large amounts, will absolutely have to be approved by you. If your father is able, and there is a monetary inheritance that will be going to your brother, it needs to be placed in a trust that is specifically designed for persons with disabilities. Otherwise the state can take that money to provide for his care in the group home.", "NTA, it really is your decision and it is always very easy for someone else to say you should look after your brother. But to you he is your bully/attacker, even though he may or may not be able to help it, he is a potential danger to your daughters, so I totally understand your decision. If you find the right group home for him, where he will be happy and looked after, then I think that is a reasonable compromise.", "NTA - even without the abuse history, taking care of your brother would be quite the undertaking that you can\u2019t do without fully committing to it; you\u2019re under no obligation.

You are under no obligation to care for your sibling... especially if he was abusive in the past. As a parent of someone on the spectrum, I have no intention of ever forcing my one son to care for the other in any way.

Further, social security and Medicaid rules can be incredibly strict, and providing your brother with finances can jeopardize his ability to receive the support he is entitled to.\n\nIt sounds like you have family more interested in pointing out you are doing things wrong than they are interested in actually helping you or your brother.\n\nMy assumption is that while you need to make these tough and necessary decisions, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will cut your brother out of your life or leave him completely unsupported.", "Info: Did your parents leave anything to your brother? Will you be his legal guardian once your father passes away?", "Lol, your aunt is mad because you\u2019re holding it against him, that he abused you so bad that you were put into foster care despite having two present parents. Is she insane? Of course you\u2019d hold that against him, it\u2019s called learning the hard way that your brother is not to be trusted and not allowing him to abuse your children too. Your aunt is on another planet here, she just doesn\u2019t want to take him because a 45 year old, violent, mentally handicapped man is a LOT to deal with.

Given you have been physically harmed by your brother previously and you now have young children, your first obligation is to your children, not your brother.  TBH, your father should have made the necessary arrangements a long time ago.

Sounds to me like the group home would be the best thing for your brother.", "NTA, he is not your child and you are not responsible for him.", "You are NTA.  Ask any of those pricks who are bad-mouthing you why they aren't stepping up and offering to take your brother in. \n\nYou aren't responsible for him because he is your brother.  That is your father's job.  If he hasn't set things up so that your brother is looked after and assumed you would do it, that isn't your problem, you have your own life and family to take care of.  \n\nYour brother should *already* have been in care.

When do you think you\u2019ll be able to meet me at a lawyers office to sign over all the paperwork?\u2019 \n\nAnd then when they let you know that that\u2019s not  what they meant and that they can\u2019t do that and it\u2019s your responsibility.

It's that he's also an addict and that he has behavioural issues that you can't help him with.\n\nYou are finding a suitable situation for him where he will be cared for and get support for his issues. That is literally taking care of him. If your extended family or anyone else has an issue with that, then they can take him in.", "NTA. Your children come first.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want to have a (possibly) violent middle-aged alcoholic man living with you and your children. Your duty is to your own children first and foremost.

NTA. This sounds a bit like something that happened in my family. My uncle was mentally disabled. His parents expected my father to always be there for him if needed. He lived with his mom (my grandma) but my dad was often called to help. My father died before the uncle and there were a lot of talks about what to do once my grandma passes away. \n\nThe point is that it's a difficult situation but your aunt is making it more difficult and guilt tripping you.

NTA", "Yta , and ultimately shouldn\u2019t get the house", "Exactly, let Auntie do it, even neglectful father is giving him house.", "Exactly there lots of homeless shelters he can stay in", "To quote Will & Grace:\n\nGrace:  Better him than me.  I'm just saying better him than me.  Yep, better him than me.", "That's what we have been doing and scheduled walk throughs with his caseworker.", "I plan on visiting him regularly and zooming as frequent as I can. I forgave him long ago after therapy but I just can't be responsible for him. It would not be fair for everyone involved especially my children.", "I am in talks with his caseworker about the group homes and she's sent me lists that we can visit on the days I come down to take care of things. I fully intend on staying involved just not as his caregiver. I plan on visiting and calling and checking in. The inheritance that he will get goes into a fund because he's on ssi and ssdi and she said that can go towards his care as well if absolutely needed. I don't plan on abandoning him.", "People like OP\u2019s brother probably don\u2019t fare well if they\u2019re left on their own. OP said his brother can barely use a microwave.", "It's in my mom's will. The house is to go to me after my dad has passed. My brother got her boat and other things but my dad sold it for him to pay for back taxes they fell behind on. It did not have anything in there about me taking over my brothers care. My cousin thinks she knew in the end that I wouldn't and wasn't going to fight it because I went LC every time the topic was brought up. She wanted to see her grandkids more than arguing. The house is in a suburb and when talking to the inspector and agent they said to sell it back to the bank would be the easiest thing to do. I am going to look into it further and talk to whoever I need to.", "Read through OPs comments dude. He is getting money and the house belonged to HER mother. They are half siblings. She\u2019s also not just dumping on the side of the road, she is researching group homes with his case worker, and plans on still visiting him. It may not have been his fault but that doesn\u2019t erase the trauma. If he stayed at that house, he would be much more of a responsibility to her and that\u2019s not fair to dump on a sister who was terrorized to the point of foster care.", "Because it's not her dad's house, OP mother's house.", "The house was her mother\u2019s. Not his.", "Oh fuck this. You don\u2019t owe your abusers forgiveness.", "The house is her mother's house. They have the same dad but a different mom. Legally, the brother has no rights to the house.", "I worked in group homes for folks with autism and mental illness (concurrent), they were great. Lots of support and fun activities and personal spending money given out daily. \n\nLet\u2019s not advocate putting people down when they are able to have decent quality of life with a bit of care.", "It's not her father's  house, it is OP's mother house.\nAlso the house is not valuable in the state it is.", "Because the house was my mother's and he's my half brother through my dad. She didn't leave the house to my dad because he was already selling assets that I was supposed to get from her to settle debts and support my brother. He's getting a cash inheritance and family heirlooms that's worth quite a bit and I'm only getting the house now.", "You have a good plan.  Stick to it and take care of yourself and your kids.\n\nReply to each and every one of your complaining relatives to thank them for offering to house your brother. Tell them you'll talk about it with your father and will get right back to them with the details.", "OP, my uncle is autistic. My grandma dedicated her life to taking care of him. He destroyed her house, though, and it was becoming an elder abuse situation. It was decided to put him in a home. And you know what? He\u2019s thriving. He needed that structure. And it\u2019s a good thing it was done at that time, too, so everyone could get used to the situation. I can\u2019t imagine how much more difficult it would have been if they waited until after she passed. You are absolutely doing the right thing for your brother and your family, and your aunt needs to back off.", "More importantly, why didn't they take you in when you had to go to foster care?", "NTA It is NEVER right for an abuse survivor to support or care for their abuser. Never.", "Your aunt is a bloody hypocrite.  Why didn't she take *you* in instead of letting you grow up in foster care?  Ghost her, you don't need people like her in your life.\n\nSame with anyone else who criticizes you.  Don't be polite to these people.  If they're not willing to take him in they can STFU.", "Your aunt doesn\u2019t sound like a sharpest knife in the drawer if she said that and still finds issue in you not stepping up be your brothers caretaker", "There you go! No one who isn't willing to let him live with them because he's \"too much to handle\" has no business getting on your case because you can't handle him either. Stop talking to these people. Block them and cut them out of your life. They obviously weren't there for you to give you a safe place to stay when you were growing up. Giving them any more thought or time is just a waste of your time.", "Well your aunt is a hypocrite. NTA", "But your aunt thinks he should be in your home. Around your kids. Don\u2019t sweat this hypocrite", "And the aunt is that tone deaf to not see the disconnect there?  He\u2019s too much for her to handle and an alcoholic, yet he\u2019s fine for you to take care of with your own kids.  And after you had to leave your home as a child because of him?  Wow!  OP is NTA. Stay firm OP and don\u2019t give in.", "Well, he's too much for you to handle too. I would just block them, but if you feel you can't do that, answer any text calling you a bad person with \"so when should I tell [brother] he's moving in with you?\"", "lol WTF shes trying to pull here then block that woman", "You need to throw that back in her face every time she brings it up.", "LOLOLOL!!! He's too much for her, but just the right amount for you. Got it.", "How is she going to force you to take care of autistic man with a drinking problem and a history of abusive behavior? She is a f****** moron", "A huh, so *you* have to deal with it but she doesn't? If she mentions it again tell her to stop bring a hypocrite and shut up.\n\nYou aren't abandoning him. A group home with supervision isn't homeless and sleeping on the streets.", "So your aunt admits she can't handle him and he's an alcoholic but expects you to house him with your kids?? You are actually doing what's best for your brother, does he have a caseworker? It can take awhile to find a group home and if he has behavior issues it might take longer. Tell your relatives they're more than welcome to take him in if they're so concerned", "Did she actually listen to what she said, when she said it to you? She fully admits he's too much to handle since he has a drinking problem, but it's okay for you to have to handle it. Yeah. She's ridiculous. NTA.", "Golly good for you and children but not her.  Don't listen to barking dogs or Aunts.  Protect your family.  Sorry about your childhood, never too late to have a good childhood.", "But it\u2019s ok to think that you should be his care provider for the exact same reason?", "Then don't feel guilty. People love to point fingers and be all holy and mighty but don't actually take the responsibility. \nSo, find him a group home and be done with it. NTA.", "NTA - unlike your aunt.", "Then all you have to say is that you are not letting your brother live in your home for exactly the same reason she's not letting him live in hers.", "OK, so he's too much of a hassle for your aunt, but not for you apparently? They've basically volunteered you to take care of him because they don't want to? Seems fair \ud83d\ude44 NTA", "Then she is a hypocrite and you should tell her and anyone else that, \"if it's so easy you can take him in then. I'll start the paperwork for you.\" If they say no, say, \"so you are throwing rocks from a glass house, hypocrite.\"\n\nDon't take their crap.", "So the good old, I can't have him but you should. Ha! Having a go at you over it like no, no one else can do it for the same reasons you're saying yet somehow you're still the bad guy... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Sounds more like wanting a reason to judge someone.", "So even your aunt admits he is \u201ctoo much to handle\u201d but says you must take him in? \n\nTell her that she\u2019s his aunt and if she\u2019s so upset by him being in a group home, then she needs to take him in. After all, he is family, right?\n\nYour aunt needs to put up or shut up.", "Curious. Will you be covering the cost of the group home indefinitely? I'm in a similar situation where my half brother is autistic.", "That's perfect. Sending your brother off might sound cruel to your relatives in the first moment, but most autists drive on routine. I wasn't diagnosed until I was an adult, but I absolutely thrived in an ordinary border school. Daily routines are always the same, everything off from routine will be announced weeks before, meals plans can be seen weeks before. No suddenly routine changes because someone is sick or doctor visits, because the employees will simply change shifts, so there is always someone there, offering the same service.\n\nAdditional in a group home for autists, people are trained about his condition. They go home after their shift, take a mental break, and come back relaxed the next day. You wont, if you care for him 16 hours a day.", "I wouldn't blame you if you walked away from all of them.  You can refuse sn inheritance, btw.", "And now you're wanted by a partner AND daughters! A fine human being who has risen above the muck to  still do the right thing. Bless you on your journey.", "Not sure if this has been said elsewhere, but you are not obligated to keep explaining your decision over and over or even at all.  I would explain it to each interested person one time and then that's it.  Don't continue to let them needle you.", "If they are so worried, they can visit and call.", "You\u2019re not obligated to see him", "And how is he getting access to alcohol?", "That's fantastic! I'm glad he will get the care he needs in a way that won't stress your family. Don't listen to the naysayers. It sounds like you have it covered. Definitely NTA", "They are definitely going to put him on downers, sit him in front of a tv with a circle of other people also rotting slowly on medication, and MAYBE once in a while they\u2019ll take him outside for a walk but he\u2019ll be so out of his mind he won\u2019t even know where he is. If that\u2019s quality of life I wouldn\u2019t want to live it.", "Oh ok . If you are getting the house from your mother then that\u2019s fair . NTA", "She just had my cousins and I would be too much. The casework informed her I had to go to therapy twice a week and she had to promise no contact with my parents and it was too much for her.", "Not only that, but none of these asshole relatives took OP in when OP was in foster care.  They can all go to hell.", "Otherwise OP will doom their own kids to the same life they had in and out of foster care especially since now there\u2019s a drinking problem too which likely was not a factor when Op was young", " \n\nAn adult with known problems that caused you to be placed in foster care should not be with you.", "His \"friends\"  people he grew up with. He walks right into the bar and they serve him. I've told them not to serve him multiple times reported them and nothing gets done. They also just take his money. It got to the point that I had his caseworker put him back on having a payee when he got his checks because he'd blow through his money on drinking or \"helping\" his friends.", "The only way to keep him from it would be to send him to a locked facility.", "None of the group homes I worked in did any of that - but hey, do t let me stand in the way of your catastrophic thinking.", "If you do this, OP, be very careful with it. In many states, a person receiving waiver services/state support in the USA can't have over 2k in their name or they are in danger of losing their services. If you want to provide some money for him from the sale of the house, either keep it informal (as in, you hold on to it in your own name and give him a small gift,, either money or experiences, every so often to slowly provide him the money or talk with a lawyer about making a special needs trust for him. Especially if him living with you full time is not an option, don't let people guilt you into making things \"equal\" if it will jeopardize his care!!", "u/Similar-Culture-3903 is a bot.\n\nOriginal comment:\n\n>u/shellyrad\n1h\n\n>NTA he is not your responsibility at the end of the day. Maybe you could leave a little money aside for him from the sale of the house since it\u2019s an inheritance from your parents but other than that you owe them nothing you got to focus on your family.\n\nRewording bot version:\n\n>Maybe you can set aside some money for her from the sale of the house because it's your parents' inheritance but other than that you haven't given them anything to focus your family on.", "???? Being autistic and drinking isn\u2019t qualification for medical assistance in dying", "Well, from the sounds of this aunt, you may have dodged a bullet.", "Fuck her. I had family let me stay in foster care too. Unforgivable, though I\u2019m sure you and I were both better off in the long run.", "Stolen comment. Which is why it makes no sense in context. Downvote and report.", "My parents\u2019 home is in a similar condition with my autistic younger brother. Your story sounds a lot like mine except I was never put in foster care. My brother is 6\u20199\u201d and 450 pounds, and with a huge temper, they (say that they) can\u2019t find a group home that will take him. I already know that when my parents die, I will not be able to care for him. You\u2019re definitely NTA. It\u2019s good you have a plan to get him into a group home.", "well, yes, and that's the exact reason you can't take him in, either; he's too much for you to handle, as well.", "You\u2019re missing the point of the questions. Everyone here is on your side. They are trying to coach you through talking to your aunt. \n\nEvery time she criticizes your care of your brother, you should be offering to have her take over his care.", "What a nightmare. He needs a state conservatorship. No surprise he doesn\u2019t know how to handle money.", "This is good advice, but assumes that he does have benefits. Hopefully he does, but not all families do this. OP, if he doesn't have SSI benefits, Medicaid, and food stamps, he needs to apply with your help. Then do what this poster advises and set up a special needs trust.Make sure your father isn't directly giving him money in the will, that it all goes into irrevocable trust. Otherwise all the money would have to be spent down until he qualified for state and federal benefits. If he already has these benefits, he can lose them due to the resources.", "Once I was put in a group transitioning group home for soon to be emancipated fosters I did end up in a better spot. The state paid for my 4 year degree because I was in foster care and helped me get my license and find a job until I started college. Which was awesome because my dad spent my college fund my grandparents left me on other things. Especially repairs to the home my brother did.", "Don't even bother discussing it with her, OP.  She's already verbally abused you, and now she's got the rest of the relatives harassing you.  Just ghost her.", "OP said in another comment they will be talking to his caseworker on Monday so I just wanted to give them a heads up before they get there", "Then next time anyone reaches out to condemn your decisions offer to let them have the house to fix up and that your brother will be on their doorstep for them to take care of in a week! If they respond with anything other than ok then respond back asking why their reasons not to do it hold more water than yours?"]}
