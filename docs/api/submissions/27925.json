Unfortunately, the only room I had left in my house was a guest room with a queen airmatress I was planning to offer to Aunt and daughter. I explained if she was bringing Sue, I didn't think I had room in the house since I didn't think it was reasonable for all 3 of them to sleep on the airmatress.

She said she was no longer going to make it since she couldn't find a dog sitter and was tired of feeling left out of the family/treated differently.

You did the best you could for your aunt, went above and beyond in my opinion.  She's acting insulted that you don't have a regular bed for her and her friend, even when you offered to rent a room for them elsewhere.  Good grief, let her pout.  It IS her choice, and her choice is to be a small person about your generous offer and to bend the truth to make herself look like a mistreated victim.  Sheesh.  She's going to miss a good family gathering and wedding, I'm afraid, but like you said, it's her choice.  Have a lovely wedding!", "Info: Is it at all possible that Sue and Auntie are a couple?", "NTA. She\u2019s a liar so let her miss it.
