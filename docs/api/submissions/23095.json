Wonderful girl, she had like the best music taste, sense of humor, and was and is just the coolest person. I had to move cross the country for grad school and broader work opportunities, that's the only reason we fell out of touch. \n\nBut in the last couple of months we've been catching up, she called me out of the blue to let me know she heard from one of our mutuals that I was living nearby, and it turns out she's the next state over. I caught up with her parents, met her fiance \u201cMark\u201d and we all got along really well, they really wanted me to come to their wedding this July, so I did.\n\nAfter the important part of the wedding was over (you may kiss the bride, the vows, yada yada), I made sure to congratulate her and her man and then I just went over to the open bar. I guess I was bored or just not paying that much attention because I had a lot of drinks, and I was kind of wasted already before the reception even got close to starting. So I took Sonya's dad aside and told him I was leaving and to tell the bride and groom I just didn't feel well. But Mark saw me and told me I had to stick around a bit longer and go to the reception since it's \u201cthe best day of their lives.\u201d\n\nI wasn't thinking the clearest so I was like sure. Mistake. I was just sitting at the reception trying to eat like a normal person when I just started crying. I really don't cry that often so I guess I have to blame the alcohol. I apologized and got out of there fast but I know I must've made some kind of scene because the next day I got a phone call from Mark saying I \u201cruined their wedding\u201d and I needed to give Sonya and the rest of the family a formal apology in person.\n\nSadly though I've taken my yearly limit of humiliation so I told him how about no and hung up. Sonya's not upset and doesn't consider her wedding ruined, but she thinks I should apologize to Mark just \u201con principle\u201d so we can continue getting along the way we were, and that I did do a wrong thing \u201ctechnically\u201d by getting so drunk and leaving early. \n\nWhile she's right on that end, I did do my time at the wedding and the only thing that could have potentially been ruined was the reception, so Idk.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690282415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15951pv/aita_for_getting_really_drunk_and_leaving_my/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thanks man\" and had the DJ play something upbeat, or silly.\n\nHere's the thing; if you were so emotional at this wedding that you got drunk and started sobbing in the middle of the reception, it might not be the best for your mental health to continue this friendship anyway.

So you're still in love with Sarah. I pieced that together from the first few sentences of your post, long before you mentioned the crying part. You know who knows you're not over her? Not you, clearly. Not Sarah. *Mark*. Mark knows. Mark likes that he \"won\" and you lost. You probably made him feel insecure, so flaunting it was enjoyable for him. It was shitty of him coerce you into staying, but...\n\nB. You should have been wise enough not to go. You could have made a polite excuse when they invited you and stayed away. You can't be friends with these people, nice or not, because you're only bringing yourself pain. (See A.) Also, Mark *is* kinda an ass.\n\nC. There's not enough info on the drinking/crying part. How drunk are we talking - did you take a bunch of shots and \"accidentally\" get wasted? Or did you have an empty stomach and mindlessly sipped some drinks that ended up being too strong? For me, imo, it's all about the intentionality of your drinking. And with the crying - was it a loud sobbing thing? Was it quiet in the corner? How many people were at the reception and how many people actually saw it? This may be an unpopular opinion, but you can be cringe without being an asshole.\n\nD. You tried to leave earlier when realizing your inebriated state, so that's why I went with NTA. (Idk wtf people here are talking about - like you have to stay for the whole reception or you'rea dick??? Bullshit. Receptions are very optional.) You're definitely an idiot (sorry, but true), but I don't think you were an asshole here.\n\nDon't give Mark some formal apology, that's dumb. I have the feeling he's overreacting on purpose to further humiliate you and feed his ego. Shoot him a text that says something like, \"I'm sorry for my display of emotion at the reception - it was out of place, and embarrassing, and wrong. I guess I realized I'm still grieving the end of my relationship with Sarah. I honestly didn't know that until your wedding. I'm glad she ended up with a great guy like you, and I wish you all the best. I'll be keeping my distance out of respect. Take care.\"\n\nAnd then make sure you send them a nice wedding present.", "NTA, you *shouldn\u2019t* have gotten so drunk, but you tried to leave when you realized you weren\u2019t feeling alright.\n\nI think you should apologize to Mark on principle too, just for the sake of civility. But he\u2019s the one who insisted you stay, so if he doesn\u2019t accept a modest apology he might not be worth any more time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
