But the videos aren\u2019t only making fun of the neutral aesthetic itself but also how much of the advertising for the aesthetic has the children not smiling and looking super serious about things. So the photos are, like, children in all-neutral outfits on a rocky beach on a gray day looking like they\u2019re having an absolutely miserable time. Now, some of them really are just making fun of the aesthetic itself. But personally, the parts where they\u2019re making fun of how the aesthetic is so concerned with being \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d that the kids in the photos look miserable are the parts I find funniest. Why does any parent look at a photo of an unhappy child and feel compelled to buy that thing for their child? How does that advertising work?", "No one had ever said anything to her.

Bohemian is a throwback to Romani inspired fashions in 19th century Paris and later Woodstock. It's splashes of bright colors and patterns and far too many plants. \n\nThe \"everything beige\" look is a Scandi design trend, which is why the German accent works as a joke for Americans, because most of us don't know the difference.", "I live a maximalist aesthetic and I have had people call it cluttered, chaotic etc I would never make fun of someone just because they like minimalist style and neutral tones.", "Just because her feelings are hurt doesn't make her right or entitled to an apology.", "Why did I have to scroll so far down for this?\n\nOnly correct answer so far.", "Listen, if you're confident enough to make it your whole aesthetic, you gotta be confident enough to not care when people think it's ugly.
