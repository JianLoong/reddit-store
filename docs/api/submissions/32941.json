But the videos aren\u2019t only making fun of the neutral aesthetic itself but also how much of the advertising for the aesthetic has the children not smiling and looking super serious about things. So the photos are, like, children in all-neutral outfits on a rocky beach on a gray day looking like they\u2019re having an absolutely miserable time. Now, some of them really are just making fun of the aesthetic itself. But personally, the parts where they\u2019re making fun of how the aesthetic is so concerned with being \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d that the kids in the photos look miserable are the parts I find funniest. Why does any parent look at a photo of an unhappy child and feel compelled to buy that thing for their child? How does that advertising work?", "No one had ever said anything to her.

Bohemian is a throwback to Romani inspired fashions in 19th century Paris and later Woodstock. It's splashes of bright colors and patterns and far too many plants. \n\nThe \"everything beige\" look is a Scandi design trend, which is why the German accent works as a joke for Americans, because most of us don't know the difference.", "I live a maximalist aesthetic and I have had people call it cluttered, chaotic etc I would never make fun of someone just because they like minimalist style and neutral tones.", "Just because her feelings are hurt doesn't make her right or entitled to an apology.", "Why did I have to scroll so far down for this?\n\nOnly correct answer so far.", "Listen, if you're confident enough to make it your whole aesthetic, you gotta be confident enough to not care when people think it's ugly.

These otherwise normal women embrace the calming, neutral atmosphere of muted colors, and then The Algorithm begins feeding them increasing amounts of super intense accounts where the moms don't allow screens in their homes, processed foods of any variety, and they all have the subtle (or not) condescension toward parents who don't do what they do. \n\nFrom there, they get progressively more extreme (don't give medicine for fevers no matter how high, visit chiropractors instead of pediatricians, use essential oils and \"natural\" remedies with no proven benefits). Eventually, you're unschooling your kid on six acres of land in the middle of nowhere where nobody receives medical care outside of dire emergencies.\n\nSorry for the rant there. Like I said, this is *absolutely NOT a universal truth* for people who appreciate a neutral color scheme, but I have noticed moms who are engaged in mom-blogger content (specifically Sad Beige Mommies) tend to follow that path.", "The kid will exposed to plenty of color outside the home.  I haven\u2019t seen anything conclusive saying this will be harmful to a child, and I doubt any such study exists.", "Where did OP say the kid didn\u2019t have colorful toys? I can only see decor and seasonal decorations mentioned.", "For most of human history, we didn\u2019t have a reliable dye for colors like red.  The bright, vivid colors that we know today are recent innovations.\n\nI\u2019m sure she takes her kid outside and he sees beautiful , blue skies, green grass and trees, flowers, etc\n\nHe\u2019s 1.5. He\u2019s not expressing clothing preferences or anything else yet, so we can\u2019t judge if she\u2019s being fair or not about that.", "I\u2019m thinking she is super offended because she knows it\u2019s not really healthy. \n\nGranted, I don\u2019t know how extreme she is. But everything being beige or neutral tones? Kids aren\u2019t aesthetically pleasing. They are messy and colorful.. not that the entire home needs to reflect that but they should have a fun creative space. I also fear some of these people get too upset over messes or things out of place which is pretty harmful to kids growing up.", "They think we care?\n\nI'd be laughing at her for the attempt. There's a difference between with and at.", "I'll be damned. That all ran together in my head, then. I could have sworn it was at the same time.", "Yes, contrast, which can be from white to black in shades of grey. Nothing more contrast than black and white. Also, white and brown/beige are a contrast anyways. So it's not hard to achieve a healthy amount of contraat while keeping a cohesive design.\n\nETA:\nMy dad is an engineer with a passion for art, he read a study about the contrast idea when I was a baby in the 90's. He was interested to see if we could sort the Greys. They were confusing at first, but then we could! It was more challenging, but we could sort blocks and shapes in a range of white to black. \n\nI'm not saying that anyone should do this, but if you wanted monochrome with contrast you could do white to black with multiple shades of grey, different finishes, patterns, and textures. That would be very stimulating.\n\n All solid grey and beige is not good. I would bet the beige lady's home has tons of texture, a lot of different beige, whites, creams. If she is a mommy blogger, I'd also bet she takes her kid to do tons of fun, stimulating activities outside the home.", "Uhhh, none of those are studies. Two of those are sites that sell things so should automatically be excluded as scientific evidence. The other two are Psychology Today which isn't peer reviewed (nor does it give access to any of the studies they cite) and a WebMD article that says literally nothing about the benefit of bright colors for kids.\n\nI'm not trying to defend the beige aesthetic thing, but I'm certainly here to defend science because what you just tried to reference ain't it.\n\nEdit: \"cite\" instead of \"site\"", "That doesn\u2019t say anything about having neutral colors in the home. It says \u201cbright colors are okay\u201d also, webMD is not a reliable source. As someone who works in healthcare, when a patient says \u201cI read on webMD\u2026\u201d I know they\u2019re about to say some bullshit.", "do you think the sister keeps the child inside 24/7? As long as he's fed and cared for the baby will be fine", ">Having an al white, beige and gray home environment is bad for kids.\n\nI've never heard that. Please show me the peer-reviewed double-blind studies that proves this.", "If she's a mommy blogger, then she is extremely extreme. Her baby isn't her job; her pictures of her (sad, beige) baby is her job. Everything, including the baby, has to be perfect at all times. \n\nI mean, a blog about a rambunctious messy child getting into everything would be a lot of fun, but sis doesn't sound like she's that way at all :)", "As a mother I would totally stand up for my kid if a grown up mocked them, not just laugh at \"her attempt\" specially if that's my damn own sister making fun of my kid.", "Bro, ice bucket challenge has been around way longer than any of these folks are saying. I remember my school making a few teachers do the ice bucket challenge during a pep rally or something back in the early aughts. It may have gotten a huge boost in popularity around 2014, but it's been a thing for a while.", "Eh, plenty of doctors I know warn about googling any sort of symptoms, but they do tell me sites like WebMD and Medscape, while not always having complete info, are still better than many sources out there. I tend to prefer Mayo Clinic and Healthline but I still highly advise anyone against just going off of the internet when it comes to serious things. Primary physicians exist for a reason.", "I mean there\u2019s literally studies about how bright colours are necessary for a baby\u2019s development, especially their eye sight, but whatever you say \ud83e\udd37", "Yeah...that's not how human development works. Baby's need so much more than physical necessities to thrive.", "Haha this statement is so wrong \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll permanently debilitate children, just that it\u2019s not good for them. Children learn color association at a young age, they develop their eyesight through contrasting colours in order to differentiate objects, etc. *Too much* colour can be distracting at school, but having no colour outside of muted sepia and gray at home? I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll be beneficial.\n\nI doubt there\u2019s any double blind studies on this because most parents aren\u2019t dumb enough to want no colour in their house because of a trendy instagram aesthetic. There are however articles by psychologists and educators taking about how bright colours are *good* for kids, and I\u2019m inclined to take their word for it.", "https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/smart-baby/202009/color-matters-and-child-development\n\nI think you'll find there's a very strong weight of opinion from professionals that these environments not good for kids."]}
