That's a parent. You don't have to stay in a room where people are abusing you, and the fact that none of your \"friends\" defended you makes me question whether they really are your friends or whether you should be looking for new ones.", "NTA. You were doing a nice thing by being the DD, but you absolutely don\u2019t have to sit through verbal abuse because someone is \u201cdrunk\u201d. There are taxis, ubers, busses etc for this reason. Grapefruit insulted you, belittled you, and brought up things he had no business talking about. I would have left them there too.", "NTA.\n\n\"He was drunk, he didn't mean it\" is in the top ten stupidest phrases in the history of the world.\n\nOh you just suck up the abuse because he is drunk.  Bull-fucking-shit!\n\nI would tell 24m to \"control his man\" or he can find other friends.", "NTA. \n\nDrunk people have low inhibitions. Maybe he didn't mean to say it, but he meant what he said. And that \"girls without fathers\" line is one of the most disgustingly misogynistic things I've ever read. \n\nThat your \"actual friends\" are defending someone who mocked you and blamed you entirely for your breakup is also distressing.", "Nah, your friend told Grape before they were drunk, and Grape apparently had a whole spiel waiting to unload on you. \n\nKeeping in mind that no one goes out to here some rando diss their choices.\n\nI think you should have asked your uninvolved friend is she was coming with you, but 24M and Grapefruit dug their own graves.\n\nNTA", "NTA. These are a group of mid 20s adults, not a solo drunk young woman. The only danger they would be in by you leaving is if they were assholes enough to drive drunk and that\u2019s not your fault, that\u2019s a crippling defect of their humanity (seems it wouldn\u2019t be the only one in some of their cases). So what, they had to pay for a taxi/Uber? That\u2019s called the asshole tax.", "NTA but 24M is not your friend...", "NTA.

And not fair on all friends. \n\nHowever then saying you endangered them and they were walking the streets. What would they do if you dropped dead? Not be able to go out ever again as they\u2019d be stranded.", "NTA if someone can't keep secrets and other one can't keep their lips sealed, they deserved what they got. You can always state that you didn't mean to take off and just wanted some fresh air but couldn't take the abuse any more so you left. They chose to get drunk and its not like they are kids.", "NTA. Don't bite the hand that feeds. If there's lyft/uber where your friends are you didn't \"endanger\" them, unless you count them having to pay for an uber as \"endangering\" their wallets LOL", "In vino veritas... He meant it alright..  He wasn't accidentally clumsy. He was full on ranting \n\nAlso NTA. They can take an uber", "Friends ? Friends dont say inappropriate tbings to one another", "What century is this? Of course you need to put your career first, how is that even an issue? What a bunch of AH they are. You, NTA; keep it up and ditch all \"boomers\".", "NTA, they can get a taxi or Uber etc. No matter what happened with your relationship no one has the right to talk on it except you and your ex. Unless you ask people to, also it wasn\u2019t right for you friend to share something so personal about his friends. Also maybe they were too drunk to stop him then but they shouldn\u2019t side with him after they sobered up. Yes you left them however they should have understood the situation and apologized or asked him to apologize. They weren\u2019t stranded in the middle of nowhere.", "NTA. A DD is supposed to get everyone home safe while saving them taxi/uber money, you're not obligated to watch them and their behavior. \n\nThem saying he was drunk and didn't mean it and you shouldn't be mad because of that is some of the most toxic form of thinking anyone can have. Being drunk doesn't give people an excuse to be AH.", "Years ago, some of your friends guilt arguments might have worked a little bit.  Waaay back in the old days before cell phones and Uber.   Your friend should be mad at himself for blabbing your secrets to his boyfriend.   Grapefruit should take responsibility for his big mouth and over bearing opinions.   \n\nSo what if they had to pay to get a ride home?  Lots of people take an Uber to and from bars so that they can all drink.   If your friends really are your friends, they should be concerned about your feelings and patching the relationship up.   If they aren\u2019t apologizing for the situation and how badly they hurt you then would really question the friendship.", "NTA, and I'd have a long and deep heart to heart with your \"friends\".", "Don't fuck with the security guards, the paid dancers, or the designated driver.

He shouldn't be drinking if he can't handle it. \n\nDid he apologize? I doubt it. OP, you did nothing wrong. You do need better friends, though. The ones you have at the moment suck.", "NTA but I also don't agree with how you handled it. Should ypu have to sit there and be abused? Definitely not. You did make a commitment to being the dd which, to me, means being the responsible one and getting your people home safe. I think you should have ended the night at that point and dealt with their being dicks when everyone had sobered up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
