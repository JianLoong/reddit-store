You are there to enjoy the night as much as you can sober while acting as cheap transport... there are always more methods of transport.\n\nAs for the main problem, I'll start with advice to you despite the situation not being your fault at all. If someone is in a relationship, assume their partner knows. Maybe not all of it, maybe only the general overview and no details, but they know. And they know at most everything you have said to your friend.\nA good, trusted friend should keep it to themselves, especially if explicitly asked to, but they are people too.

To make things worse, when you were at your wits end from what he said, hurting you where you are emotionally vulnerable, they didn't comfort you. They didn't focus on your well-being. They wanted their cheap ride home.\n\nThe only one I can see being remotely excused is 22F, who was caught up in it despite no personal input. Even then, their frustration at having their night ruined should not be at you, but your friend and their partner.\n\nI wish you the best and hope you can heal from that bad relationship.
