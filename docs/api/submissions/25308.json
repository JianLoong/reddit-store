Also, your sister didn't do anything other than try to hook you up and try to support her friend, and she doesn't deserve to have to hear that shit because the two of you put her in this situation.\n\nAlso, the possibility of the parrot learning to say just part of that and going around calling people sluts should be too high for your comfort, ~~especially if you still live with your parents.~~ (ETA OP has said it's his apartment and indicated his sister may live with him. While this does give him the right to ban his ex from the apartment- assuming that his sister/their parents aren't paying into or for it considerably, in which case it is their apartment and friends coming over is more negotiable- it does not change that he's being a dick with the parakeet.

No. \n\nTell your sister you aren't comfortable with her bringing Abby to your house, and find a way to get the parakeet to stop saying it... it'll just be a reminder of that, and it won't feel very good. Trust me. I wish I could forget my unfaithful ex. Imagine trying to do that while your parakeet just won't shut up about it. I can't blame you for being upset, but this just isn't they way to go about it. However, cheaters don't deserve to be comfortable.
