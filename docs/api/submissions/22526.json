Your opinion just seems like common sense.\n\n But technically she can request whatever she wants, wether or not people do it is another story.

I'll be honest, I hate the trend of turning the wedding party and/or guests into props for a photo opportunity. Attending a wedding tends to be pricey to begin with.

I would be so curious to know why she chose that color for me and how she picked everyone's else. It also sounds so much fun to see people in a color scheme that is out of what you usually see and see all of that play in one room.

You have chance to sprey water to your relatives.", "My brother's first wife insisted all guests not in the wedding party wear khaki. \n\nPlease note I said first wife.\n\nNTA.", "I'll make it easy for you.  If I got an invitation like this I would decline the RSVP.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She is for her response, but not the request. You're right to point out her crazy. She can also be crazy all she wants and guests can decline the invitation. It's the same for childfree weddings, destination weddings, black tie weddings etc. Less bizarre, but still a request guests can decline coming over. But you were just looking out for her, so you did the right thing.", "Given the way your sister is, not surprised that this is a second marriage. Be ready for more colour scheme shenanigans at wedding 3!", "NTA. Your guests are not wedding decor.", "NTA, OP. You tried, but there\u2019s only so much you can do to save people from their own delusions.\n\nImagine being sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and hearing that her second shot at happiness depended more on what guests will wear to her wedding than on you!", "NTA. Tell her maybe for the next wedding (now this is actually petty, your comment is fine). Sorry I just find people demanding guests to spend extra money so annoying. Attending weddings is already expensive in general.", "Love the way you put this", "My red headed ass will burn such an invitation before wearing \u201cmustard.\u201d", "That or they'll take the piss. \"Mustard suit\" you say? Party city French's Mustard costume suit it is!", "In the interest of ~~getting rid of this god awful jacket~~ helping a bride\u2019s vision come to fruition, I will ~~be ecstatic to~~ selflessly volunteer to give my husband\u2019s mustard yellow jacket to one of this bride\u2019s guests. Don\u2019t worry about fees or shipping! I\u2019ve got you covered!", "I even think colour scheme for the guests is fine.\n\nIf by colour scheme you mean \"all light colours\" or \"shades of green please\"\n\nNot whatever OP's sister is trying to orchistrate", "If she is telling every single person what color to wear, I think she is going by where she has placed them sitting at the venue, so when she looks at the wedding photos or video, she will see the exact image she saw in her dream, or given those colors, maybe a photo of leaves turning in New England. I wonder where the fianc\u00e9 proposed. Anyway. NTA, some people put more thought into creating their perfect day than the marriage itself.", "I've heard of black and white weddings but never other specific colors. I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing most of those colors.", "I would use it as a thrift store quest. I would end up wearing whatever I could find in my specific color, but the style could be questionable.", "I mean based on my rest of the colors she clearly meant spicy brown.", "Yeah, I would simply wear whatever I was going to wear anyway, and then say \"oops, I didn't see that part\" if called on it.", "Miss Manners and Helpful Heloise.  Those were the days....", "Pinterest and instagram are the worst things to happen to weddings. I am not a prop for aesthetics, I am a guest who wants to celebrate without wasting money on an outfit that will end up in my \"donate\" pile by the end of the year.", "It\u2019s a financial hardship for me to even attend a wedding at the moment. Appropriate present, + a likely night at a hotel?\nNow you want me to buy a whole new outfit in a color I probably don\u2019t like?\nHard no.\n\nWeddings are supposed to be about celebrating a new family with those closest to you (I think). If they matter, you want them there no matter what color they\u2019re wearing. Making a wedding into a glorified instagram post just cheapens the whole thing, and I\u2019m not even religious or married.", "Yeah I am definitely a rare exception that would think this was really awesome, but for the broader community it\u2019s absolutely unhinged. OP\u2019s sister needs to save this idea for a fun dinner party with her artsy, open minded friends not try to tell probably 100+ adults from varying walks of life what to wear. \n\nNTA", "Hey if the plan is for the wedding to become a clue themed murder mystery, that actually sounds like a fun idea.", "Right, and what happens when Mr. Chartreuse declines? Does someone else have to wear that colour?", "Love the placemats as gifts.  I want them to be that tacky foam backed vinyl too! Fabric was my first thought, but then I saw burnt orange vinyl in my head and, yeah.", "It\u2019s getting ridiculous to be honest!  But people are more concerned about getting the aesthetic they want  to impress everyone on IG than enjoying the day with family and friends. At least it seems that way.", "The funny thing is, as a guest, the best part of weddings are the things that go \"wrong\" like the flower girl at the wedding I attended as a teen, who was playing with her hoop skirt and alternately flipping it back and forth and showing off her ruffle butt. To this day, I can't remember whose wedding that was, but I'll never forget it.", "It\u2019s a dark brown color. (I had to look it up lol) it\u2019s like a tree trunk color.", "Op listed several shades of yellow", "\ud83c\udfafAs usual, the women are asked to spend more\u2026..\n\nOP, NTA. This is ridiculous. Brides and their \u201cwedding aesthetic\u201d demands these days\u2026..\ud83e\udd2e\n\nI, personally would love to be \u201cassigned\u201d turquoise, then show up in the biggest, shiniest ultra-turquoise feathered hat with a full-on old lady outfit to match. \n\n(Kids: One of the best parts about becoming elderly is that you can get away with stuff like this\u2026..)", "Nah. OP would be the A to not say anything, and sit back and watch as sister embarrasses herself.", ">Soft YTA since you admitted you were being petty, but it seems like she overreacted.\n\n\n\nReally? \n\nBecause in my world, when you love someone, you can tell them they about to lose their guests and torpedo the perfect wedding they going for.", "I got held up at umber...\n\nUmber is a natural earth pigment consisting of iron oxide and manganese oxide; it has a brownish color that can vary between shades of yellow, red, and green. Umber is considered one of the oldest pigments known to humans,\n\n\nWhat what effin colour do you want me to wear?", "I'm a redhead and look great in mustard. It's all about undertones mate. That said assigning me a colour, even one that suits me, would have me noping out fast.", "Most redheads look great in mustard, so I'm not following. Now if it was pink on the other her hand ..", "I'll come as Miss Scarlet to your Colonel Mustard", "\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6", "Even shades of green is much too specific. I could see \"neutrals\" or \"jewel tones' or \"earthy tones,\" etc.,  that give some ranges of colors to choose from.", "Mustard.  Anything from virulent yellow to wholegrain with many shades.  I make a yummy mustard sauce that is almost white.  Snicker.", "My husband would definitely do this. His reaction to this requirement would not be positive and his obnoxious side would immediately emerge lol", "Yeah, if I received this invite I would, depending on my mood and my relationship with this person, either thrift store it, just ignore the color requirement, or decline the wedding altogether. What I definitely *wouldn\u2019t* do is spend $500 or whatever on a brand new formal outfit in whatever weird color the bride has requested. Totally bizarre.", "I see a future malicious compliance in the making. Contact as many guests as possible and have them wear the color they were \u201cassigned\u201d but the most tacky/outrageous version. Yeah I\u2019m feeling a bit cheeky tonite but it\u2019d serve her right for making aesthetics more important that the actual marriage.", "You think in concept it's really awesome but wait till the invite comes through the door and she's picked a colour you *never* wear and not only that, she's picked one you actually hate. \n\nNot so fun then is it?\n\nI don't really like pastel anything but if I got an invite saying \"pastel shades\" I'm sure I could rummage up something I don't hate. If however I got an invite specifying I *must* wear 'Peach' I would probably just decline the invite", "I wonder if it\u2019s her way to thin out the guest list\u2026", "I was also thinking that the guys could show up in a Lloyd or Harry tuxedo, they come in all kinds of colors.", "Yes, ma\u2019am! I love being old and not giving a crap about peer pressure.", "Sure, but if your sister is overly stressed and insecure and is at the point of stuffing envelopes for that perfect wedding, you can be apply a bit of tact.  It doesn\u2019t seem like OP did that.\n\nYou can be right without being a jerk about it.", "Brown\n\nEdit: I also enjoy the history of pigments. Also do a bunch of art stuff. So I can happilly go own about umber shade variations in different makers\u2019 paints and all that. \n\nBut for regular people, they mean brown.", "Strip naked and cover yourself in wet mud. Job done.", "My redheaded mother looked amazing in almost the full spectrum of yellows & oranges. I, also a redhead with hair & skin tone just a little bit different from her , look like an underripe, bruised banana unless it's the right shade of lemon yellow, tangerine or copper.  \n\nI would NOT be spending time & money trying to find a wedding-appropriate outfit in a color prescribed by the bride", "I had a small wedding of about 30 people (closest friends and family, super casual in a city park) I wore a yellow dress and my husband wore a blue suit (our favorite colors) so since yellow + blue makes green I asked all the guests to wear something green \u2014 I said they could wear as little or as much as they wanted, an accessory or whole outfit, and any shade was fine! Everyone was super supportive, sweet and accommodating, I loved the end result and it was fun to see how many different ways the color green was interpreted \ud83d\udc9a", "I make a cherry mustard that is a deep burgundy.  It'll do!", "Has this thread just turned into malicious compliance", "I'm blonde and super white :( and look even more vampireish/ washed out in yellows. I'm jealous!", "That\u2019s reasonable. I look terrible in green, it makes me look like I\u2019m going to throw up, but if the stipulation was like yours I\u2019d be all for it.", "Yes that's reasonable. I wouldn't want to have to go out and buy a green dress though unless I was bridesmaid."]}
