It\u2019s one thing to tell people not to wear white to a wedding (most people should know this already but there are idiots in this world). It\u2019s  a whole \u2018nother thing to demand such\u2026.weird colors.", "NTA. This is totally over the top.", "NTA. People would most likely have to spend money on clothes they won't ever wear again when they probably already have wedding attire in their wardrobes. wouldn't be surprised if they ticked the \"no\" attendance box. \n\nif your sister's happiness and love is based on wedding guests following an aesthetic then she should prepare herself for a second divorce.", "NTA. if I got a wedding invitation like that i would just ignore it and not go. no way in hell I am wearing a mustard yellow anything", "ESH. This is a pretty demanding and potentially expensive request but ultimately it\u2019s not your wedding and it\u2019s her call. Anybody who thinks it\u2019s too ridiculous a request can politely decline attending.", "You're the first to bring it up to her. \n\nMy guess is that as invites go out, people will begin to tell her no.  Or they'd show up in colors of their choice.  You just know that someone will deliberately pretend that they misunderstand what mustard is...", "Nta\n\nColor scheme for the wedding party is one thing, a black tie dress code is one thing, what's she's doing well guarantee that people will either not come, or just ignore that part of the invite. \n\nNo one is going to buy a mustard suit they will wear once for *someone* *else's* party.", "NTA", "Wow, the notion that people not knowing she wanted them to wear burnt umber would ruin your sister's second chance at love is just...wow...\n\nIf I were you, I'd stay out of it.  When people who think that being ordered to come only if they purchase a marigold dress start RSVP'ing no, sister might learn an important lesson about whether or not the moon and the stars revolve around her.\n\nWhat a ludicrous, entitled demand.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m older and I\u2019d go dressed like the late queen.\n\nThis is incredibly rude. They\u2019re guests, not props. I have no idea why people think Instagram is more important than the people they\u2019ve presumably invited to share their happiness.", "YTA.\n\nHer and her partner's wedding, their rules. She can decide guests will not be admitted unless they have garnet birds' nests on their heads. She's just got to accept that some invitees will decline over a rule that adds expense or inconvenience.\n\nPersonally, I think the people you celebrate with matter more than the pictures and I like my mismatched oddball loved ones as they are, but not my wedding, not my call.", "NTA - you are allowed your opinion. I don\u2019t think your opinion is \u201ctrying to ruin her second chance at love\u201d or sabotaging it. That\u2019s just silly! Saying nothing and sitting back to laugh seems like sabotaging it lol. Your opinion just seems like common sense.\n\n But technically she can request whatever she wants, wether or not people do it is another story. Like they might just say eff it and show up in whatever colour they want and she will end up disappointed, or they will choose not to show up at all, and she will be disappointed OR they will be like \u201coh fun!\u201d And go along with it. There\u2019s going to be a mix of reactions.", "NTA, if I got an invite like that, I would question burnt orange or any strange color.  Then I would talk to others to only find out they have different colors.  One of two things would happen most likely I would not attend.  Better yet I would organize a group to show up in sweat suits the listed color, and they would be about 10 sizes too big.  Either way they will get a set of placemats in the requested color.", "Sure she can ask people to wear whatever her heart desires. She can request that everyone cosplay as Chewbacca if she wants. Her party, her rules.\n\nWhat she can\u2019t expect is that weird rules won\u2019t affect her RSVP responses or compliance. If she just recommended people dress in harvest colors, listing the colors you mentioned as examples, she\u2019d get a similar effect and a more positive response from guests.\n\nOn the bright side, she\u2019s gonna save a ton on catering and favors.\n\nNTA", "What is her wedding theme, the giant box of Crayola?\n\nNTA. You may be the first to voice your opinion about this batshit crazy plan, but I strongly suspect you will not be the last, and that the RSVPs will start rolling in with declines from The Fuchsias, The Aubergines, Mr. and Mrs. Periwinkle, etc.", "NTA. I'll be honest, I hate the trend of turning the wedding party and/or guests into props for a photo opportunity. Attending a wedding tends to be pricey to begin with. Assigning colors to your guests crosses the line for me. Of course, I guess people could just not buy a wedding present and sirens that money on buying an outfit in a color they'll never wear again.", "NTA\n\nI assume you went to the first wedding and you'll probably get to go to a third wedding. No reason to apologize and no reason to attend.", "This is great. She demands periwinkle, guest doesn\u2019t have it, guest doesn\u2019t have to go to some lady\u2019s second wedding. Huge win for the prospective guests.", "In this case, YTA.  Is requesting her guests wears specific colors over the top?  Absolutely.   And the guests can choose to attend wearing the chosen colors, attend and ignore the color request, or respectfully decline the invitation.   It's not on you in any case.", "NTA. I had to double-check your sister's age since she went crying to Mommy. I'm sorry but your mom can't make you apologize, and if someone tries just do it to be the bigger person tell them to pound sand. She going to be in for a rude awakening when no one shows or completely ignores what she wants.", "It is a bit extra but she just wants everything perfect.  So she mails the invites and people might or might not wear what she suggests. Hope you like the color she picked for you.", "NTA  People are not aesthetic or part of the wedding decor. They aren't table clothes, napkins or flowers. You told your sister and uncomfortable truth, the guests aren't a prop at her second wedding.", "NTA.\n\nShe's about to witness an incredible amount of weaponized incompetence from all her guests. \n\n\"This isn't umber? I'm soooo sorry, I thought this was the color you asked for. These old eyes must be playing tricks on me.\"", "NTA - if i'm invited my color better be blue or grey.   Otherwise she's going to be one very frustrated control freak.", "I am so confused by all this wedding aesthetic needs.    Why is that more important than celebrating with your nearest and dearest?   with friends and family?       \nWhen I got married I just wanted my family and friends to attend.  bridesmaids - find an off white free you like.  Groomsman - white shirt. blue blazer, khakis and we will provide tie.  Done.    It was beautiful, we had the best time celebrating.  My mom bought 5 outfits for the wedding - I told her to choose what she felt the best in. \ntoday it seems like the wedding is more important than the marriage.   WTH?\n\nand yeah you are NTA and your sister is in for a rude awakening/.", "I don\u2019t even know what color \u201cumber\u201d is, lol\u2026", "NTA.\n\nBeing the bride gives you plenty of rights. Coming up with a whole new rainbow is not one of them.", ">burnt orange, marigold, mustard, garnet, and umber\n\nIs this a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving wedding theme?\nNTA", "NTA \n\nGuests are going to show up in a color similar to the one she wants, not those specific ones. If she really cares about having certain ppl there she should put her aesthetic desires in her Pinterest account", "Info:\nIs it a small wedding?  Like 20 people?   \nI could see that being annoying but still a thing.   At a 20 people wedding, I\u2019d wear whatever color the bride asked (as long as we are family or super close friends) \n\nIf it\u2019s larger than that, heck no.", "Personally I would love receiving an invite like this.  I would be so curious to know why she chose that color for me and how she picked everyone's else. It also sounds so much fun to see people in a color scheme that is out of what you usually see and see all of that play in one room. Sounds like a Wes Anderson wedding. \n\nBut that's just my childish mentality. In reality, it's an irrational thing to ask your guests. It might be her wedding, but you choose to celebrate it with other people for a reason. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You don't need to apologize. You just pointed out the obvious and didn't force her to change the invitations.\n\n It's her wedding and she can do what she wants. But she'll be disappointed when either people decline her costume event or ignore the dress code. \n\nI would decline, personally. As Miss Manners says, a wedding invitation is neither a summons nor an invoice.", "NTA. This is next level ridiculous to ask guests to go buy specific colours to match their invitation.......what will she do if someone just shows up without these colours?  Is she going to send them home?  Is she going to make a scene at her own wedding?\n\nBridal party and even groom party you can dictate colour schemes, even a general theme for guests, but all of the guests individually? That is way too much.", "NTA. Like you said it's one thing to put \"please wear fall colors if possible\" but specifically requesting a color per person is just WAY too much.", "NTA\n\nHoly crap that is some weird ass entitled behaviour. Who does that?", "Yep NTA! She can throw some autumn leaves in the air to make up for the lack of guests in her photos.", "I would hunt down the strangest, most exotic mustard, but one, and find a dress to match. \n\nIf the bride dare say anything, I\u2019d whip out the exotic mustard and say \u201cexcuse you?

I hate that concept so much. But here\u2019s a situation where people using it actually makes sense.
