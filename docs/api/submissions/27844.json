You can\u2019t risk it. You absolutely should have let her know the rules before she booked the flight, that is YOUR fault and your fault alone, but you also should not let her near your newborn.

You are right to protect your newborn who has a limited immune system. People saying she is no longer contagious please look it up. A common cold and similar viruses can be transmitted until ALL symptoms disappear, cough being one. Letting a coughing person near a newborn is highly irresponsible. Being sick and not understanding being kept away is lacking common-sense or is being reckless.\n\nHaving said that, this should never have occurred. Travelling and visiting a newborn so early is not sensible. Sister is right to be annoyed at wasting time and money but should at least understand why it's better this way.", "With a 2 week old, you've got to be very careful.  She won't be happy to hear about it after getting off the plane, so you'll need to really explain to her nicely, that you're so sorry but you can't take chance on your baby's health.  Apologize for being so last minute and ask her to please understand where you're coming from.  \n\nAnother option, if you're OK with it, is for her to keep her mask on while at your house.  Wash hands as soon as she gets to your house, but keep her distance from the baby with the mask on.  Basically if she's out of the bedroom, she should have her mask on.   \n\nI know that a lot of people are saying that YTA but I beg to differ.  My niece was born a few months before covid showed up here and we hardly went anywhere once we started hearing about confirmed cases in the US, and only allowed close family members to visit.  With little ones, you can never be too careful.\n\nHope everything works out with you and your sister.", "Thanks for your comment :)\nI ended up having a chat with her via the internet during a layover.
