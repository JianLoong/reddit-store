Yes. YWBTA if you expect she'll be pleased to hear it when she lands. Can you make accommodations for her at a local hotel and Zoom meet, or offer her some other injunctive relief? She should have known to fly direct to her home city if there was any question unspoken before she left about the baby. Congratulations on your new baby, BTW.", "INFO \n\nDid she know about this policy before making plans to visit?", "YTA. In you comments, you note that you never actually bothered to inform your sister of this rule. So by denying her a visit, you're wasting her time and her money.  I would consider this a pretty serious thing if one of my siblings treated me this way.", "YTA If you tell her and she has nowhere to go. She stated it was a leftover cough from an illness from 2 weeks ago. She's not contagious with a cough", "If you have the means, maybe you could rent a room for her nearby? Or have a friend put her up? That would keep the rules the same while not leaving her with no place to stay. You could visit yourself if you felt comfortable. You could Zoom with the baby.\n\nThe only real AH move here, in my mind, is letting her get off the plane with nowhere to stay. If you provide for her, apologize for the inconvenience, and visit virtually, it's sad that you can't do what you had hoped, but understandable, given the rules you've had with others and with other children.", "Just have her wear a mask.", "YTA i would of cut you off my life for WASTING MY TIME and MONEY. You should have done the check way before she booked. Its very inconsiderate. Tell her the situation and offer to pay a hotel at YOUR EXPENSE. This is something i would disown you kind of thing if you didn\u2019t at least offer to make it right.", "BIG YTA. You didn't tell her about the rule and assumed she knows. Now she spent money of the ticket and Is on her way. You can't make an exception for her cus that'd be hypocritical of you and your husband wouldn't like that. You're gonna be the bad guy to one of them, your sister or your husband.", "YTA - it's called communication.  YOU never communicated this rule.  Doesn't matter if it was for this kid or the other one.  YOU never communicated it and now she is literally on a plane heading to you.  Exactly how where thinking of breaking this news to her?  HOLY SHIT!!!  I just thought of something... Are you supposed to pick her up from the airport?  Because that would just make you an epic AH.", "YTA by a lot. First, you never communicated your expectations to your sister. Second, she\u2019s not infectious anymore. Third, you\u2019re wasting her money and potentially leaving her stranded with nowhere to stay. I don\u2019t have any sisters but if my brothers or my friend did this to me, I would rethink the relationship", "YTA and so is your husband. She's on the plane and she isn't sick, not really. \n\nIt sounds like the real problem is you've been steamrolling your husband and he's more looking to punish you / feel equalized than any actual concerns about your child and it's health.\n\nYou two need need to get in the same page and not punish your sister over this.", "NAH. Chances are she's not contagious anymore, but travel brings in more risk. You're not keeping score/blocking exceptions, you're worried about the health of your baby. \n\nMake a reservation for her at a nearby hotel or AirB&B for your sister. Trade off spending some time with her away from your home while your partner watches the baby. Let her \"meet\" your baby outdoors from a bit of a distance.", "YTA. (1) You agreed to a risky plan to let her do this (travel abroad and straight to your house). (2) You never told her the sick rules. (3) You let her get on the plane to you. \n\nAbsolutely the AH, and I'm pregnant currently.", "YWBTA\n\nYou never told her about your policy and now she came there for nothing.

Maybe I am misreading, but sounds like she didn\u2019t hear about the cough until her sister was already on the plane.\n\nYou have to protect the baby, period.

You should have asked her to wait until she had been home for at least 2 weeks. Everyone picks up bugs on flights. There is a reason why health questionnaires always ask if you have been out of the country within the last two weeks. \n\nMy in-laws just came home from a trip to Europe and have tested for covid. My husband catches a cold every single time we come home from a vacation. I would never allow someone who has just flown, or been on a vacation. come near my baby, even before they start developing symptoms.", "She\u2019s an adult, not a two week old helpless infant who can\u2019t be exposed to viruses", "She isn\u2019t able to fly direct to her home city and either way would have had to come through my city regardless. We do regularly do Facebook calls so she has seen the baby that way already :) I don\u2019t expect her to be happy about it at all, just trying to protect my newborn mainly and seeing if I\u2019m being an AH here and how to try and avoid being an AH", "I didn\u2019t explicitly say it no, but I did have the same rules with my first born (this is my 2nd child)", "Agreed can\u2019t you just ask her to wear a mask when holding your newborn for extra protection?", "We don\u2019t really have the means to pay for a room, but we are looking into providing airport transfers and arranging somewhere to stay for her", "How would that work? \"Hey sis, before you book that plane ticket for two months from now, can you just confirm: are you planning to get sick?\"\n\nShit happens and it sucks but OP absolutely should prioritize the health of her two week old.", "You know people can get sick at the last minute after they book tickets/flights right? \n\nAlso it is likely sister knew the guidelines and didn't say anything before.", "I don't think it's her rule that people think is wrong.

You need to protect your infant, kids come first. Covid is on the rise, cold and flu season is around the corner. Not to mention other illnesses like RSV. Anyone who goes to see vulnerable people like 2 week old infants with coughs etc , are selfish and dangerous. The text she should have sent was \u201csorry I have to cancel visit have a cough\u201d she been travelling weeks overseas she could have any number of things. Not to mention the time on the plane, and what she was exposed to during the flight.  Keeping your sister away from you baby right now doesn\u2019t make you an AH, it makes you a good mother. Your sister is an adult she can book a hotel until she can fly home", "> I didn\u2019t explicitly say it\n\nYTA duder, you needed to have told her about the chance of this happening so she could plan accordingly. \n\n>but I did have the same rules with my first born\n\nThis doesn't change my mind. If you know there's a significant chance of having to bail on the visit, it's on you to make it fully clear. \n\nI'm not saying you should let her visit, because obviously your child's health is the top priority, but I do think you have to live with being an AH in this situation.", "Was your first perhaps born around 2020?", "So she's expecting to stay at your house and you didn't bother to inform her and ensure she knew the rules that would get her plans completely changed? Are you planning to play for a hotel for her or what?", "Then YTA- just dont have anyone visit until youre ready to go in public with your baby. \n\nYour sister paid money and is dedicating time to come visit you and your baby, and while she's in the air you want to tell her dont come? You knew she was going to be flying abroad for weeks, so you knew there was a chance she could pick up something during her travels... yet you agreed to her doing this plan and visiting your two week old at this time.", "Then it will likely cause her some distress? I would not advocate for an unannounced application of your household policy. But, maybe she will feel tenderhearted about your circumstances and sympathize?

It was explicitly stated then.", "I\u2019m not convinced that she had no idea about it though, only because I was on the phone to her yesterday and as she sounded sick I asked her if she was sick and she said no. I only got the message at midnight last night saying that she actually did have a cough and whatnot.", "First was born late 2021, we have continued to have the rule when visiting the firstborn as well (as in since he\u2019s been born we haven\u2019t had people over who have been sick)", "She hasn\u2019t been cleared by a physician, she\u2019s been overseas for the past 3 weeks. \nBoth of our concern is mainly that she would unintentionally pass this on to our newborn, which could then cause her to end up in the hospital. (Newborn had lung issues at birth which is why we are also extra cautious).\nIt\u2019s obviously not my sisters fault that she\u2019s sick, she can\u2019t help it. I just wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive myself if I did nothing and then my newborn ended up very sick.", "Residual coughs from viruses that have cleared can last months due to a cycle of irritation in the bronchial system that is caused by the coughing. That's not the same thing as being sick.", "And people are supposed to remember this three years later? In 2020, it was unlikely that anyone was traveling anyway. So the idea that the sister was supposed to remember rules put in place during that time is just expecting too much.", ">>but I did have the same rules with my first born\n\n>This doesn't change my mind.", ">I\u2019m not convinced that she had no idea about it though\n\nMaybe. But I'm not convinced she did have an idea about it, which if you had communicated your boundaries clearly while in the planning stages of this visit, you could be sure of.", "I think that there's a valid reason for people to expect different rules in 2023 vs 2021. Just clarify your expectations to avoid misunderstandings in the future.", "Your baby was born two weeks ago and you knew your sister was overseas, i really don't understand how this sprung up while she was on the flight. It makes perfect sense to not have someone that just got in from overseas travel visit, but you had that information two weeks ago...", "[deleted]", "True story. And there is also the reality that people often have more stringent rules for a first child than a second. It's not necessary the right way to go, but many first time parents are more nervous that they are the second time around.", "That\u2019s fair, thanks for providing an alternate perspective :)", "Will do, thank you for your feedback :)", "She hasn\u2019t seen any form of physician, I know this for a fact. I don\u2019t doubt that there are qualified doctors overseas, however she has not seen one. She works in the medical field and would have self diagnosed."]}
