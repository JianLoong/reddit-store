It's totally normal to object to an eight year old thinking she has to wear make-up because she's ugly or unsightly without it. It's horrifying she already thinks that. I'm mean yeah, possibly it would have been better coming from her dad but someone has to say something. Someone should control her parenting if she's already giving her kid a complex.", "NTA\n\n An 8 yo shouldn't wear that much makeup. And that's from someone who loves makeup. But it's not for children. Sure, maybe a little blush once a year wouldn't do any harm. But at 8, makeup is damaging for her skin. Hell, i'm a grown up and i don't put all that makeup.\n\nP.s. this sub really hates stepmothers. You should go to r/stepparents, they might be able to help you more", "This is one of those situations where\u2026 I agree with you, but it\u2019s not your kid, so you kind of just have to deal with it. Yes, what her mom is doing is ridiculous and damaging, but you need to deal with these things through her biological parents- you\u2019re never going to win this fight unless your husband steps up. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to you to make the call- it\u2019s up to her parents.

Your husband is an asshole though. He should've been the one to talk to her about it.\n\nYou are amazing for taking the initiative to care about this little girl's mental health. Make-up is fun, but when you begin thinking you're ugly without it, there's a problem. Especially as an 8 year old! What business does an 8 year old have knowing about dark circles under her eyes? Someone (likely the mom) is telling her these things. That's terrible.\n\nThe most you can do now is to try to reinforce how naturally beautiful she is.", "NTA but \"too much makeup\" is less concerning than the \"ugly\" comments.

You are 100% right, and your heart is in the right place, but the better move would have been to have your husband talk to her mom. I imagine being a stepmom is hard - you love the kiddo, and you want what\u2019s best for her, but you have to sometimes defer to the mom on things you might not like so much.\n\nMom sucks too, though, for putting those ideas in her daughter\u2019s head, and your husband needs to do better with regard to his daughter - if he thinks she\u2019s wearing too much, he needs to do something about it.", "At 8 years old she shouldn\u2019t be wearing any makeup.  Very poor parenting.  The child is already having issues with her looks without makeup.  Now how did an 8 year old get that mindset", "NAH, or possibly ESH - I think you're coming from a good place, but the way you communicated your concerns obviously didn't work too well...", "NTA. an 8 year old shouldn\u2019t be worrying about being \u201cugly\u201d and needing makeup to be pretty. you\u2019re right, makeup is a tool to enhance your beauty, not just make you beautiful. if an 8 year old is using makeup, it should just be for fun and nothing more", "While I sympathize enormously you badly over stepped.

You want to help her self esteem? Don\u2019t complain about her makeup or her choices.", "Yta - her mom decided that was okay. Different rules for different houses. It's not your place to tell the mom how to parent.\n\nYou should continue to reinforce that she looks great without makeup (and worry about why an 8 year old has bags under her eyes) but that's it.\n\nBuy makeup remover for her.", "YTA you're right but you just have to shut up really, she's not your kid and you have no say, the best you can do is continue the message that makeup is just meant to enhance beauty, and maybe get your partner to invest into some good skincare", "YTA.

Neither of you can prevent the child's mother from saying those things when it's her custody time.

She's also going to soon start the \"I hate my body\" phase as she approaches puberty (which is also happening younger and younger), so having those affirmations ready and figuring out how to talk to her about those things is super important, and that's something to plan out with dad.
