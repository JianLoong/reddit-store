{"id": 7796, "submission_id": "10gkblz", "title": "AITA for refusing to remove disability accommodations from the house I share with my husband?", "selftext": "I (31f) have been best friends with Kat (31f) since we were 6 years old. We grew up and went to uni together, bought homes on the same street, and are basically family in all the ways that matter. She is a very important part of my life and I love her like a sister.\n\nKat is disabled. She has a degenerative condition and has been in a wheelchair since we were in secondary school. Unfortunately, the world often fails to consider accessibility needs. In uni, this meant that there were a lot of limitations on places we could go together because so many places were inaccessible, uncomfortable, and sometimes downright dehumanising. This is why a few years after we graduated, we both decided to move out of our parents' places and buy property on the same street. Our dads and her uncle are tradies and spent nearly 2 years renovating and making both our places accessible. We took it as far as money would allow, and included things like an outdoor kitchen and firepit, a small \"bar\" area etc. It's made a world of difference. We spend a lot of time at each others' places, do cocktail nights, sleepovers, entertain friends, and when her family visit, we have enough rooms between the two of us to accommodate everyone's needs(her mum and brother also have varying degrees of mobility issues). We still go out together, but not as often.\n\nHere's the problem: 4 months ago, I got married to Tom(36). He moved in, and after a few weeks of no problems, we started fighting because he wants us to get rid of the modifications made to the house. He feels they spoil the look of the place, the stair lift chair makes the stairs narrow and he bumps himself when he gets up in the night (this part is true), the roll-under sinks, cooktops and showers are wasting space which could be optimised for storage or additional decor. The bins are annoying because he has to bend to use top handles instead of foot pedals etc.\nHe said it's not ableist to want the things in your house to fit your personal needs, that Kat doesn't live here, and I can just spend time at hers. \n\nI redid the office to make it so he could have a normal room, but it isn't enough.\nI told him that I was willing to compromise and keep only the modifications in the high traffic areas and one accessible bedroom and bathroom, so Kat or a guest could have a room when they visit. It would mean the majority of the house would be redone to his tastes, but it's precisely those areas that he hates the most. \nI refused to completely get rid of everything because these accommodations mean a lot to me and my family, and he said I'm being an AH by treating him like a guest, choosing my friend over my husband, and making selfish decisions without considering him especially since he gave up his condo to live with me.\n\nTLDR: My best friend is disabled. My husband and I aren't. My husband wants to remove all accessibility accommodations that allow Kat to visit comfortably. I refused and upset him", "created_utc": 1674180308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gkblz/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_disability/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is it that he has issues now? He had to of known of how your house was before taking the vows.", "Info:  Was any of this discussed before you moved in togehter? I probably will get voted down for this but I think both of you have valid points. I just don't understand why this wasn't brought up before he gave up his condo and moved in with you.", "NTA\n\nHis point about the house working for those who live there makes sense, except you are a person who lives there too and part of what makes this house work for you is being accessible. He married and moved in with someone who has clearly gone to great lengths to accommodate their friend, then for some reason expected you to reverse all that. You have also offered a compromise where he clearly just wants to take over the space.", "NTA, but you know this isn't about the modifications, right? It sounds like he resents Kat and others for spending so much time in your home and removing the modifications is his way of claiming the space for you and him only. The fact that you didn't immediately choose his needs over the needs of your friend are likely only adding fuel to the fire.\n\nI am extremely close with two friends I have known since we were 11 years old. We had open door policies and basically lived in each other's houses, everything we had was pretty much communal. Then one of my friends married a man who is extremely private and values his space. It fucking sucked at first, but now we hang out other places when we meet, or I actually have to make an appointment so he knows in advance. The other one got married and had a kid, so I can't exactly just drop in anytime day or night anymore either. Relationships change and so do people's boundaries. You need to decide if having your home be accessible to your friends and family is more important than your husband's personal space. If Kat being able to come and go at your place is of paramount importance to you, living with your husband might not work out. If your husband's comfort is more important, then you will have to tell Kat you'll be spending more time at her place. However, I do not think it's unreasonable to leave one bedroom/bathroom accessible, nor some of the less intrusive modifications. Perhaps your husband will compromise if he feels his needs are being recognized.", "NTA. Your husband of four months is trying to drive a wedge between you and your sister. This is a major red flag.\n\n(I know she's not actually your sister, but she is in all the ways that matter)", "NTA. He was aware of these modifications prior to moving in, even prior to getting married, right? I'd call it a complete deal breaker that he is know demanding all sorts of changes be made.", "Info - Did he know about these modifications to the house before moving in?\n\nNTA. If he was already aware of the modifications I don't see why he wouldnt have talked to you about it before willingly moving out of his condo... From reading your others comments also it seems ridiculous for him to expect you to get rid of ALL accommodations, especially seeming as he's aware that this is your life-long friend... He needs to work on communicating his feelings and actually compromise with you.", "NTA.\n\nHe knew about those modifications before you were married and he could have spoken up then.\n\nAnd you never know when those modifications will be helpful in the future.   I know that many years ago, when my grandmother was alive and living in an assisted living facility a few miles from me, I wished I had an accessible place so that I could bring her to my place as a nice change for her.   Unfortunately, I rented, and renovations weren't an option, so that avenue was closed--but I really would have appreciated it.", "INFO: How much time did he spend at your place before he moved in? Did he cook or clean or anything like that? I can see him not realizing how inconvenient things were to him if he hadn't spent much time there.", "ESH-He's wrong for not speaking up earlier, but it seems unrealistic to think you'll never leave the house or move. \n\nIt also sounds like you may prioritize your best friend over your marriage, or that he may think that. There's nothing wrong with doing that, but you shouldn't have gotten married if your best friend always comes first.\n\nYeah, he's being an asshole about the accommodations made to the house, but I bet part of his problem is that he realizes he may come second in his own marriage.\n\n I wonder if he's questioning what will happen if he ever wants to move in the future, or feels like your friend is too involved in both your lives and wants boundaries set.

Nta", "NTA - so your husband wants to completely change the home you own that he had no part in purchasing or renovating?

Waiting until now and his unwillingness to compromise is making his approach to this seem quite manipulative. \n\nI also see comments above saying that he probably has an issue with you having such a close friend. I also find that suspicious and weirdly jealous. Some people went as far as to say they would have a problem with your friendship too, which I totally disagree with and think those commenters should, uh, examine in therapy.\n\nYou say she\u2019s basically your sister. Would he be acting this way if you were \u201creally\u201d related by blood? Honestly I hope you don\u2019t change anything at this point. He should simply not walk into the chair lift! Problem solved!", "NAH. My house was designed to be wheelchair accessible for my grandmother (minus the attic, but that\u2019s storage anyway). Does it suck as a 6\u20192\u201d man who can walk?

Absolutely. 4 months is barely moved in and undoing all of that is a pain and a half.", "NAH \n\nI guess I get Tom enough to not call him an asshole. However why wasn\u2019t this brought up before?", "NTA\n\nYou have had the home this way for many years, and he knew the home was this way when he moved in. \n\nThe fact he wants to remove the items that allow your friend to visit you in your home makes me worry that he will then start to isolate you from your friend.", "NAH. Maybe this wasn't an issue for Tom until he actually started living there and realized how inconvenient the modifications were on a daily basis. Now that it is his home too, maybe removing some of the cumbersome mods would be a reasonable compromise. Like, I get that you're good friends and all...but she lives right down the street. She doesn't need to stay the night or shower at your house ever.", "INFO\n\nWhy does she need to be able to shower at your house?", "NTA\n\nTheres no way he didn't know the mods were there before he decided to move in.\n\nYour friend is basically family, its the same in my opinion if it was your sister or dad.\n\nYou attempted to compromise,  your friend needs the accessibility,  he wants it removed.", "NTA, he knew this was how things were before he moved in. He doesn't get to suddenly change it. Your loved ones need and use the accommodations, that's all that matters here. This is how things were while he was dating you, he should've known this wouldn't suddenly come to a stop any time soon.", "Nta and assuming there was no ultimatum or a gun to his head nobody made him move out of his condo he chose to move into your house", "NAH. It will be a pain in the ass for the first few months as he is getting used to it, but it will be a much bigger pain if you remove it. Although, your friend lives right across the street? It's great that you can accommodate her, but also that seems a bit overkill.", "NAH/YTA border.  Presumably you married your husband by choice but you are treating Kat like an equal SO partner.  Unless you are poly and both of these people are SO's I agree with your husband.  Kat's house needs to be accessible/right for Kat; yours is for you and your (supposed) life partner.  Maybe you need to be re-evaluating who you really want to be with.", "ESH to some extent.\n\nYou want to keep a bedroom that accommodates her disability? I'm not really sure what that entails, but why in the world would your friend ever need to stay overnight at your house now, when she lives down the street? You aren't friends at uni anymore. You are grown adults with your own homes and you also have a spouse living with you. I mean, if you reeeaaally need to spend the night together, go to her house. I feel like there is some weird dynamic here.\n\nAnd why would you be expected to continue to host her disabled family members on occasion, if that means keeping features of your house that your husband (who lives there 100% of the time and presumably pays part of the mortgage) actively dislikes. They can stay at a hotel or other accommodations.\n\nI totally get that your husband does not want a lift chair on the stairs. That's pretty over the top to keep in place unless someone has a disabled family member living there (or visiting very regularly). And if storage is very limited in your kitchen, then yeah, seems like a good idea to build a cabinet under the range. Why does your friend need to access the range? And your husband uses the trashcans/bins multiple times a day, every day, so having one that is most accessible for him is much more important than having an ADA compliant one for your friend's occasional use. I'm sure you could find something that works well for both of them.\n\nThat said, your husband is being asshole-ish for demanding that everything has to be removed and not discussing any of that prior to your marriage. Keeping one bathroom with disability accommodations intact seems like no big deal, if it's not the master bathroom. And keeping the roll-under sink in the kitchen seems reasonable.", "Ew, you need to rethink the husband... He's just gross", "NTA. You and your sister deserve to enjoy your spaces :).

At worst it might be the start of more manipulation.", "I'm in a healthy relationship at this point. There is no need for us to work out hard things because we have an open communication.

I think he should have spoken up about any issues he had with the house or their friendship before getting married, but I think a lot of couples do this. They assume that marriage will automatically change things. Will automatically make the other person put them first in a relationship. If that's not happening before marriage I don't think anyone should assume that it will automatically change once they are married. I have to say if I expressed issues with our home and the compromise was to just give me one room that was remodeled to fit my perference I wouldn't feel like it was really my home. I'm sure I will get voted down for my opinion but I don't really think it's about the house being accessible for her friend as much as it feels like the friend is more of a priority to OP than her husband.", "And it hasn't occurred to you that someone who is a wheelchair user might find it easier to crash at their friends house, even if their own is on the same street?", "But one is a want and one is a need.

And at minimum they should have access to the common spaces, kitchen, a bathroom etc. Maybe there\u2019s room to change the trash bin so she puts waste in a countertop bin and you throw it away after. But having access to the sink to wash hands seems necessary. If he will compromise, you could probably address at least many of the concerns. But her basic access should be preserved", "I agree with you!", "Did you mean to comment this elsewhere? How does this follow?", "NTA. The fact that your husband waited until you were married to mention any of this is troubling, because to me it looks like he wants to limit your friend's presence in the house, if not outright ban her from it. \n\nAn accessible home is amazing to have for visiting family and friends. It's also amazing to have if one of you ends up needing it.", "Your husband isn't just ableist, he's being maliciously disableist because the modifications to your house is inconvenient to him. It's one thing to voice his concerns prior to giving up his condo but it's another to just expect you to give up all of the modifications instead of actually trying to work with what already seems to be a generous set of compromises. I'm sorry but your four month husband is not worth the risk of your lifelong friendship with Kat. Tom doesn't even seem like the type of person who'd bat an eye if you're on wheelchairs or crutches, he wants his ableist house and he wants it now damn it. Others are saying how dare you prioritize your friend over him, but as a disabled person myself, I say screw him. He doesn't get to make the world a harder place just because these accessible accommodations doesn't fit his aesthetic. I'm shocked more people aren't saying this but you're NTA. He is, full stop. He can either deal with it or go live on the streets.", "NTA. Honestly, Tom sucks.", "NTA he knew about the house before moving in. If the accommodation were done well removing them is taking value away from your home. I agree that you two need to compromise. Is he jealous? Is he trying to mark his territory? Does he hate Kat? Can you do anything to fix the bumping into the chair lift issue?", "Honestly it sounds like you're more married to Kat than you are Tom. I have a feeling this isn't about the physical layout of the house but the fact that he feels like a third wheel in his own marriage.\n\nHe's still the asshole because he is communicating it in the absolute worst way possible but it's something to consider. I and plenty of people I know have ended relationships because they feel like a third wheel between two 'friends'. Of course it is possible I'm biased because the first person I dated was fucking their best friend on the side. Still, I'm not the only one who sees it, so I'd at least consider the possibility.", "Soft ESH or NAH. I say this from a perspective of someone with a severely disabled sibling, where our house was full of accessible alterations. \n\nYour husband definitely should have discussed the issues before moving in, but also consider they wouldn\u2019t have been as obvious until you\u2019re living there 24/7. Bumping into stair lifts, or straining to use the bin or counters, is fine when you\u2019re visiting intermittently, but soon becomes annoying when it\u2019s multiple times a day, everyday. \n\nHe is right in that your house doesn\u2019t currently fit your needs as a couple, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to prioritise guests who visit every so often, over people who use the house daily. We also had to make this hard choice when my sibling went into respite care, and visited the house much less often. If you want to make your marriage work you need to compromise and equally make the house user-friendly for him.", "NTA. He knew about the modifications before you got married and he moved in and he never said anything. I assume he knows how important your sister friend is to you. You offered a compromise to remove some of the accommodations but leave common areas and one bedroom and bathroom as is,  and he wants it all removed with no compromise. He is being unreasonable. It sounds like he has a problem with your sister friend.", "So, he knew all of this before you two married? Why did he wait until after wedding to complain. Your home is designed to your tsste. He needs to back off. It very much sounds like he wants to exclude your friend from your life. First it's one thing, then another, eventually not allowing her around you at all. Little by little. Complain,  complain,  complain. Ask him why is he forcing you to change? If he really loved you. He would accept your life as it was when he met you. Not nit pick you to mold you into what he now wants. Today this. What will it be tomorrow?", "NTA. Tell him to consider the value of the property. He\u2019s asking you to greatly diminish that. Houses that are fully accessible are a premium in any neighborhood. Maybe that argument will sway him.", "NTA. This is a control thing imo.   It's rather distasteful he is now doing this after marriage.   What will his next control issue be?", "NTA. It was your house before you got married and he knew the situation. It sounds like a power grab on his part", "NTA he knew the house before, moving in and demanding to remove installations that are in place to welcome people you call family is a red flag. Yes he should feel home there too but not at the extent to shut out your people not matter how far or close they live. Marrying him doesn't undo the life you had before with family and friends, so it not unreasonable to expect him to compromise on a way to keep them in your life (which includes hosting them). Maybe I'm overreacting but this gives off a very controlling vibe. I assume he knew about your friend/family relationships before marriage, I'm not sure how far he's taking it but eg remove ramp or stuff so some people are banned completely or can't go to toilet for decorative reasons is a terrible suggestion", "NTA. Seems really suspect he didn\u2019t mention anything until after you were married. What kinds of things is he going to want to control next? It just feels off to me.", "NTA. He knew what he was moving into, and should have brought it up before moving in. You've also offered a very reasonable compromise. I suspect this insistence is more about him keeping Kat away. And he's an asshole for that. If he doesn't like your friend or if he feels like you are prioritising your friend over him, he should have *that* conversation with you, and not focus on the house and try to drive her away. \n\nThere are lots of things that can make a couple incompatible, and end up as a relationship dealbreaker - religion, kids, finances, careers, sex, where they each want to live, role of family and friends in your lives, etc. His refusal to accept your accommodations for your disabled friend is a deep incompatibility in values and life goals. It can and should be a dealbreaker if you can't work it out.", "It looks like you\u2019re getting a lot of interesting and thoughtful comments, which is great! \n\nI say NTA rather than N A H because even though I understand that your husband would want to live in a space that makes him comfortable, his unwillingness to consider ANY of your very reasonable compromises tells me that this is about something else entirely, and his heart is possibly not in the right place here. He needs to be willing to make plans WITH you, and to consider that while you two are theoretically the most important people in each other\u2019s lives, your friend is ALSO your family, and you\u2019re never going to diminish that. \n\nAlso, it feels icky to me that within the span of what, FOUR MONTHS, your husband has gone from not mentioning having a problem at all to \u201cevery carefully planned accommodation has to go.\u201d That, again, speaks to this not really being about his actual comfort in his home but more about control\u2026 or something.", "Nta. I expect the modifications add significant value to your home.", "NTA-how did he see how things were before you were married and suddenly now he wants a radical change? He didn't want you to know he was lacking in any empathy or compassion until he sealed the deal?", "Anyone else find it kind of a red flag he suddenly cares about this and it was never a thing before? That feels weird to me", "I get it, not everybody wants stair lifts in their home, and some of the accessibility stuff can be kind of ugly.\n\nBut we're talking about his inconvenience vs. stuff that probably makes a very significant difference to Kat's quality of life.\n\nI'm going NTA. \n\nTom may not be an asshole here, but he is failing to see the bigger picture, that he could be a bit kinder to Kat simply by leaving the status quo as it is.", "NTA and honestly I think you\u2019re being too accommodating of your new husband\u2019s desire to block Kat out of your space. Which is what his request would result in, even if somehow it his not his intent (and I highly doubt it is _not_ his intent)\n\nYou should also take a look at the property laws where you live. In some places, because you bought the house before marriage it is your property and not marital property. But using shared funds for a major renovation (kitchen, bathroom, etc are not cheap) could entitle him to a portion of your property in the case of a divorce.", "ESH, your husband should have spoken up before the marriage about the placement of YOUR things in YOUR home. He already knew about how much this relationship means to you and how much more difficult visits will be without accomendations. And frankly, some of his problems sound a bit petty, like having to bend over instead of having a step can. He seems insecure in the relationship and to sort through his emotions about that.\n\nNow that being said, it sounds like the accommodations, even in the compromise, are a bit excessive. You are reserving her an entire room and bathroom in the home as well as outfitting every other room in it, to fit her needs, and giving him one office.  Not to mention,  are you still planning on having regular sleepovers, all three of you? And having her family over, too? Personally, if I was building a new family together with my partner and they  spent all their time with another person and had every room in my home to fit this other person's needs and not mine. I'd feel like a third wheel too.\n\nMy suggestion is removing the hardware like the stair lift and other bulkier items and storing them away and maybe even halt the sleepovers for a while until you two settle more into married life and he gets more secure in his home. She has her own home, and there is no reason you can't visit her instead.  Then, once he feels more settled, you can focus on the areas that truly NEED more accommodation and prepare those areas for future visits.", "NTA.  Your husband is jealous of your friendship, though. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. It\u2019s Tom who needs to go. This is an outrageous request. If he had a problem with it he shouldn\u2019t have moved in.", "I agree. I fit this criteria with my wife in that she has an open door policy with her friends and such and i strongly value my privacy, but we reached a compromise in that i have my \"office\" that i go to for my personal space if she has visitors.

NTA, compromise where you can, but don't ever give up what makes you happy.", "I can't say what I want to say here without running the risk of offending OP or other cleaner minded folks than myself.

Why did she have to re-do the office to remove modifications? What kind of modifications could have been present there?

This is absolutely something she should shut down.", "Relationships with this level of upheaval always seem almost reasonable at first.

Second, guilt wife for spending time with friend or make her life miserable when she does.

Sleeping over on something other than a really rare occasion would just be weird for adults.", "This could be the basis of OP's next steps: broaden the discussion about the house and offer to make other kinds of changes so the husband feels more like a co-inhabitant and less like he's living in a home where all the decisions were made before he arrived.

That's her house, too, and if she wants to have her best friend over, then she has her best friend over.  I don't argue with my wife when she wants to see her friends, and why would I?
