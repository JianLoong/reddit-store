{"id": 7796, "submission_id": "10gkblz", "title": "AITA for refusing to remove disability accommodations from the house I share with my husband?", "selftext": "I (31f) have been best friends with Kat (31f) since we were 6 years old. We grew up and went to uni together, bought homes on the same street, and are basically family in all the ways that matter. She is a very important part of my life and I love her like a sister.\n\nKat is disabled. She has a degenerative condition and has been in a wheelchair since we were in secondary school. Unfortunately, the world often fails to consider accessibility needs. In uni, this meant that there were a lot of limitations on places we could go together because so many places were inaccessible, uncomfortable, and sometimes downright dehumanising. This is why a few years after we graduated, we both decided to move out of our parents' places and buy property on the same street. Our dads and her uncle are tradies and spent nearly 2 years renovating and making both our places accessible. We took it as far as money would allow, and included things like an outdoor kitchen and firepit, a small \"bar\" area etc. It's made a world of difference. We spend a lot of time at each others' places, do cocktail nights, sleepovers, entertain friends, and when her family visit, we have enough rooms between the two of us to accommodate everyone's needs(her mum and brother also have varying degrees of mobility issues). We still go out together, but not as often.\n\nHere's the problem: 4 months ago, I got married to Tom(36). He moved in, and after a few weeks of no problems, we started fighting because he wants us to get rid of the modifications made to the house. He feels they spoil the look of the place, the stair lift chair makes the stairs narrow and he bumps himself when he gets up in the night (this part is true), the roll-under sinks, cooktops and showers are wasting space which could be optimised for storage or additional decor. The bins are annoying because he has to bend to use top handles instead of foot pedals etc.\nHe said it's not ableist to want the things in your house to fit your personal needs, that Kat doesn't live here, and I can just spend time at hers. \n\nI redid the office to make it so he could have a normal room, but it isn't enough.\nI told him that I was willing to compromise and keep only the modifications in the high traffic areas and one accessible bedroom and bathroom, so Kat or a guest could have a room when they visit. It would mean the majority of the house would be redone to his tastes, but it's precisely those areas that he hates the most. \nI refused to completely get rid of everything because these accommodations mean a lot to me and my family, and he said I'm being an AH by treating him like a guest, choosing my friend over my husband, and making selfish decisions without considering him especially since he gave up his condo to live with me.\n\nTLDR: My best friend is disabled. My husband and I aren't. My husband wants to remove all accessibility accommodations that allow Kat to visit comfortably. I refused and upset him", "created_utc": 1674180308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gkblz/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_disability/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is it that he has issues now? He had to of known of how your house was before taking the vows.", "Info:  Was any of this discussed before you moved in togehter? I probably will get voted down for this but I think both of you have valid points. I just don't understand why this wasn't brought up before he gave up his condo and moved in with you.", "NTA\n\nHis point about the house working for those who live there makes sense, except you are a person who lives there too and part of what makes this house work for you is being accessible. He married and moved in with someone who has clearly gone to great lengths to accommodate their friend, then for some reason expected you to reverse all that. You have also offered a compromise where he clearly just wants to take over the space.", "NTA, but you know this isn't about the modifications, right? It sounds like he resents Kat and others for spending so much time in your home and removing the modifications is his way of claiming the space for you and him only. The fact that you didn't immediately choose his needs over the needs of your friend are likely only adding fuel to the fire.\n\nI am extremely close with two friends I have known since we were 11 years old. We had open door policies and basically lived in each other's houses, everything we had was pretty much communal. Then one of my friends married a man who is extremely private and values his space. It fucking sucked at first, but now we hang out other places when we meet, or I actually have to make an appointment so he knows in advance. The other one got married and had a kid, so I can't exactly just drop in anytime day or night anymore either. Relationships change and so do people's boundaries. You need to decide if having your home be accessible to your friends and family is more important than your husband's personal space. If Kat being able to come and go at your place is of paramount importance to you, living with your husband might not work out. If your husband's comfort is more important, then you will have to tell Kat you'll be spending more time at her place. However, I do not think it's unreasonable to leave one bedroom/bathroom accessible, nor some of the less intrusive modifications. Perhaps your husband will compromise if he feels his needs are being recognized.", "NTA. Your husband of four months is trying to drive a wedge between you and your sister. This is a major red flag.\n\n(I know she's not actually your sister, but she is in all the ways that matter)", "NTA. He was aware of these modifications prior to moving in, even prior to getting married, right? I'd call it a complete deal breaker that he is know demanding all sorts of changes be made.", "Info - Did he know about these modifications to the house before moving in?\n\nNTA. If he was already aware of the modifications I don't see why he wouldnt have talked to you about it before willingly moving out of his condo... From reading your others comments also it seems ridiculous for him to expect you to get rid of ALL accommodations, especially seeming as he's aware that this is your life-long friend... He needs to work on communicating his feelings and actually compromise with you.", "NTA.\n\nHe knew about those modifications before you were married and he could have spoken up then.\n\nAnd you never know when those modifications will be helpful in the future.   I know that many years ago, when my grandmother was alive and living in an assisted living facility a few miles from me, I wished I had an accessible place so that I could bring her to my place as a nice change for her.   Unfortunately, I rented, and renovations weren't an option, so that avenue was closed--but I really would have appreciated it.", "INFO: How much time did he spend at your place before he moved in? Did he cook or clean or anything like that? I can see him not realizing how inconvenient things were to him if he hadn't spent much time there.", "ESH-He's wrong for not speaking up earlier, but it seems unrealistic to think you'll never leave the house or move. \n\nIt also sounds like you may prioritize your best friend over your marriage, or that he may think that. There's nothing wrong with doing that, but you shouldn't have gotten married if your best friend always comes first.\n\nYeah, he's being an asshole about the accommodations made to the house, but I bet part of his problem is that he realizes he may come second in his own marriage.\n\n I wonder if he's questioning what will happen if he ever wants to move in the future, or feels like your friend is too involved in both your lives and wants boundaries set.

Nta", "NTA - so your husband wants to completely change the home you own that he had no part in purchasing or renovating?

Waiting until now and his unwillingness to compromise is making his approach to this seem quite manipulative. \n\nI also see comments above saying that he probably has an issue with you having such a close friend. I also find that suspicious and weirdly jealous. Some people went as far as to say they would have a problem with your friendship too, which I totally disagree with and think those commenters should, uh, examine in therapy.\n\nYou say she\u2019s basically your sister. Would he be acting this way if you were \u201creally\u201d related by blood? Honestly I hope you don\u2019t change anything at this point. He should simply not walk into the chair lift! Problem solved!", "NAH. My house was designed to be wheelchair accessible for my grandmother (minus the attic, but that\u2019s storage anyway). Does it suck as a 6\u20192\u201d man who can walk?

Absolutely. 4 months is barely moved in and undoing all of that is a pain and a half.", "NAH \n\nI guess I get Tom enough to not call him an asshole. However why wasn\u2019t this brought up before?", "NTA\n\nYou have had the home this way for many years, and he knew the home was this way when he moved in. \n\nThe fact he wants to remove the items that allow your friend to visit you in your home makes me worry that he will then start to isolate you from your friend.", "NAH. Maybe this wasn't an issue for Tom until he actually started living there and realized how inconvenient the modifications were on a daily basis. Now that it is his home too, maybe removing some of the cumbersome mods would be a reasonable compromise. Like, I get that you're good friends and all...but she lives right down the street. She doesn't need to stay the night or shower at your house ever.", "INFO\n\nWhy does she need to be able to shower at your house?", "NTA\n\nTheres no way he didn't know the mods were there before he decided to move in.\n\nYour friend is basically family, its the same in my opinion if it was your sister or dad.\n\nYou attempted to compromise,  your friend needs the accessibility,  he wants it removed.", "NTA, he knew this was how things were before he moved in. He doesn't get to suddenly change it. Your loved ones need and use the accommodations, that's all that matters here. This is how things were while he was dating you, he should've known this wouldn't suddenly come to a stop any time soon.", "Nta and assuming there was no ultimatum or a gun to his head nobody made him move out of his condo he chose to move into your house", "NAH. It will be a pain in the ass for the first few months as he is getting used to it, but it will be a much bigger pain if you remove it. Although, your friend lives right across the street? It's great that you can accommodate her, but also that seems a bit overkill.", "NAH/YTA border.  Presumably you married your husband by choice but you are treating Kat like an equal SO partner.  Unless you are poly and both of these people are SO's I agree with your husband.  Kat's house needs to be accessible/right for Kat; yours is for you and your (supposed) life partner.  Maybe you need to be re-evaluating who you really want to be with.", "ESH to some extent.\n\nYou want to keep a bedroom that accommodates her disability? I'm not really sure what that entails, but why in the world would your friend ever need to stay overnight at your house now, when she lives down the street? You aren't friends at uni anymore. You are grown adults with your own homes and you also have a spouse living with you. I mean, if you reeeaaally need to spend the night together, go to her house. I feel like there is some weird dynamic here.\n\nAnd why would you be expected to continue to host her disabled family members on occasion, if that means keeping features of your house that your husband (who lives there 100% of the time and presumably pays part of the mortgage) actively dislikes. They can stay at a hotel or other accommodations.\n\nI totally get that your husband does not want a lift chair on the stairs. That's pretty over the top to keep in place unless someone has a disabled family member living there (or visiting very regularly). And if storage is very limited in your kitchen, then yeah, seems like a good idea to build a cabinet under the range. Why does your friend need to access the range? And your husband uses the trashcans/bins multiple times a day, every day, so having one that is most accessible for him is much more important than having an ADA compliant one for your friend's occasional use. I'm sure you could find something that works well for both of them.\n\nThat said, your husband is being asshole-ish for demanding that everything has to be removed and not discussing any of that prior to your marriage. Keeping one bathroom with disability accommodations intact seems like no big deal, if it's not the master bathroom. And keeping the roll-under sink in the kitchen seems reasonable.", "Ew, you need to rethink the husband... He's just gross", "NTA. You and your sister deserve to enjoy your spaces :).

It sounds like he has a problem with your sister friend.", "So, he knew all of this before you two married? Why did he wait until after wedding to complain. Your home is designed to your tsste.

Yes he should feel home there too but not at the extent to shut out your people not matter how far or close they live. Marrying him doesn't undo the life you had before with family and friends, so it not unreasonable to expect him to compromise on a way to keep them in your life (which includes hosting them). Maybe I'm overreacting but this gives off a very controlling vibe. I assume he knew about your friend/family relationships before marriage, I'm not sure how far he's taking it but eg remove ramp or stuff so some people are banned completely or can't go to toilet for decorative reasons is a terrible suggestion", "NTA.

He knew what he was moving into, and should have brought it up before moving in. You've also offered a very reasonable compromise. I suspect this insistence is more about him keeping Kat away.

It can and should be a dealbreaker if you can't work it out.", "It looks like you\u2019re getting a lot of interesting and thoughtful comments, which is great! \n\nI say NTA rather than N A H because even though I understand that your husband would want to live in a space that makes him comfortable, his unwillingness to consider ANY of your very reasonable compromises tells me that this is about something else entirely, and his heart is possibly not in the right place here. He needs to be willing to make plans WITH you, and to consider that while you two are theoretically the most important people in each other\u2019s lives, your friend is ALSO your family, and you\u2019re never going to diminish that. \n\nAlso, it feels icky to me that within the span of what, FOUR MONTHS, your husband has gone from not mentioning having a problem at all to \u201cevery carefully planned accommodation has to go.\u201d That, again, speaks to this not really being about his actual comfort in his home but more about control\u2026 or something.", "Nta.

That feels weird to me", "I get it, not everybody wants stair lifts in their home, and some of the accessibility stuff can be kind of ugly.\n\nBut we're talking about his inconvenience vs. stuff that probably makes a very significant difference to Kat's quality of life.\n\nI'm going NTA. \n\nTom may not be an asshole here, but he is failing to see the bigger picture, that he could be a bit kinder to Kat simply by leaving the status quo as it is.", "NTA and honestly I think you\u2019re being too accommodating of your new husband\u2019s desire to block Kat out of your space. Which is what his request would result in, even if somehow it his not his intent (and I highly doubt it is _not_ his intent)\n\nYou should also take a look at the property laws where you live.

He already knew about how much this relationship means to you and how much more difficult visits will be without accomendations. And frankly, some of his problems sound a bit petty, like having to bend over instead of having a step can. He seems insecure in the relationship and to sort through his emotions about that.\n\nNow that being said, it sounds like the accommodations, even in the compromise, are a bit excessive. You are reserving her an entire room and bathroom in the home as well as outfitting every other room in it, to fit her needs, and giving him one office.  Not to mention,  are you still planning on having regular sleepovers, all three of you? And having her family over, too? Personally, if I was building a new family together with my partner and they  spent all their time with another person and had every room in my home to fit this other person's needs and not mine. I'd feel like a third wheel too.\n\nMy suggestion is removing the hardware like the stair lift and other bulkier items and storing them away and maybe even halt the sleepovers for a while until you two settle more into married life and he gets more secure in his home. She has her own home, and there is no reason you can't visit her instead.

It's still YOUR house, I hope.\n\nThis guy doesn't really sound like a decent human being. He's ignoring the very beautiful part of you that's been friends with Kat. He doesn't value her and he doesn't value the part of you that loves her.\n\nYou need to have a serious talk about these issues, possibly with a lawyer nearby. He has added no value whatsoever to your house and your interest in it needs protection.", "NTA. BTW \u2026 who owns this house? Whose name is on the paperwork? Yours, right? That answers who gets to make those decisions. He\u2019s callous and needs to reevaluate if this is the hill he wants to die on.", "NTA. First off this isn\u2019t a casual friend. You\u2019ve known each other basically for as long as you can actually remember. I have two friends like that (friends since I was seven and I\u2019m about to turn thirty) and they are more sisters to me than friends. If they had mobility difficulties I would be setting my house up in a way they could access it. \n\nSecond, when you have a close relationship with a person who uses a wheelchair you start to see spaces differently. My MIL uses a wheelchair exclusively due to an amputation and going places with her gave me a real eye opener on how many places in public and in average homes are not accessible.  You want your very close friend to be able to exist comfortably in common places in your home and have good access to a bedroom and bathroom. That\u2019s very reasonable. \n\nYou offered what sounds to me like a good compromise. Modify the areas your friend or other guests don\u2019t need to access to suit your husband\u2019s tastes. But I think it\u2019s an understandable ask that the spaces you indicated stay mobility friendly. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like the look of open spaces under counters maybe suggest decorative curtains that can be pulled back when needed. My in laws have these in their home because they prefer the look. If you\u2019re willing to spend a decent amount you could even look into some kind of pocket cabinet doors that slide away- although those would almost certainly be pretty expensive. But keeping the modifications in common areas and a guest room and a bathroom is completely reasonable. \n\nHe knew about the house set up before hand. He knows the reasons why. Living together means a compromise on how spaces are arranged. But the key here is compromise. You\u2019re willing to do so. He should be willing to compromise as well.", "NTA. Husband seems to think that your home is now his castle to have as he pleases. You\u2019ve already remodeled his office and made a reasonable compromise. Now he needs to back off and compromise.", "I do hope you have a prenup.", "NTA \u201cI\u2019ve known her a lot longer than I\u2019ve known you; if you make me choose\u2026 bye, Felicia.\u201d", "NTA! I'm disabled and if I had a friend like you who literally modified their HOME so I could visit like everyone else without having to think about if I could make it through the fucking door or to all the same spaces as everyone else? I would be so grateful. This sounds like an incredible friendship. If your husband keeps pushing to lose the accessibility mods, if I were in your shoes I'd be asking for a divorce. Accessibility will literally only make your home more valuable and ensure you can live in it longer, which it sounds like you intended this to be your forever home if life will allow it. \n\nI do think it would be wise to look into modifying the stair lift to have a seat that folds up, for everyone's convenience and safety though. Bumping into it in the night on the stairs doesn't sound very safe, so some night lights along the edge of the stairs may be good idea too.", "NTA. Awfully suspect, your husband only complaining about these things post-nuptials. Almost as if he's always had complaints but waited until you were tied down to demand changes. I wonder whether it's really the modifications he has a problem with.\n\nKeep the accommodations. Put rolling containers under the sinks and hang cute curtains to hide them, get bins that have both foot pedals and handles, and give the chair lift a tasteful makeover with some paint and a slipcover. If that's not enough, Tom will just have to live with it. Kat isn't just your best friend, she's basically family, and Tom knew what he was getting into before the wedding.", "NTA \n\nBeing able bodied is temporary.\nTo be honest I think it would be better to sell or rent the house to someone who will appreciate it and create your own space together as a couple instead of spend more money to re-modify a house that someone (maybe you in the future) will appreciate. \nBut also, he didn't mention anything until after the fact. Sounds like he made a lot of assumptions and while it's fine that he wants his home to be accommodating to him, it also sounds like he's being a real jerk about it and isn't willing to compromise.", "NTA. He knew what the house was like before moving in. Your friend is a big part of your life. He must have known that. It\u2019s weird that he wants things changed all of a sudden.", "NTA. Is your husband embarrassed to have people over to see the modifications or something?

Why didn\u2019t y\u2019all live together first? But anyway. Think you\u2019ll have more fun in life with your best friend.", "NTA. So he knew about these accomodations before he moved in *and* he cares more about the 'aesthetic' of the house and some inconveniences than you being able to accommodate your disabled best friend? Damn.\n\nAlso, do keep an eye out in the future for other behavior that comes off as controlling or ostracizing. I'm not calling your husband an abuser, but I *will* say that trying to drive a rift between you and your friends to isolate you is a common tactic from abusers.", "File this under \"things you need to talk about before getting married.\"  Who knew?  He seems like a jerk to put his aesthetic preferences over accessibility for your best friend and you've already accommodated his reasonable needs for rooms that fit him.  NTA but does he have other redeeming qualities because he's not looking like a keeper at the moment.", "NTA.  This is your best friend. Your husband is interfering in your friendship in a passive aggressive way by attempting to remove all the accommodations without telling you the real reasons. If your house and it\u2019s accommodations is a deal breaker to him, he should have discussed this before marriage. I would be livid if someone I trusted and married did this to me and wanted me to change my house so my best friend and her family no longer feel welcome.", "I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I'm going ESH instead of N T A. He should be more willing to compromise over the changes to your house and be less demanding.\n\nBut to counter many of the other commenters here, it sounds like you guys didn't actually live together before you got married. It's entirely possible that he just didn't realise how these accommodations for your friend inconvenience him until he had to deal with them 24/7, which is why he never mentioned having a problem with them. He also probably feels like he has no control over his living situation, and that probably adds to his need for change. \n\nYou should definitely keep some accommodations for your friend, but overall your spouse should come first and should feel comfortable in the home he lives in. I think you guys should talk to someone about meeting each other halfway.", "NTA. If he had a problem with the house, he should have said that before marrying you and moving in with you. If he had said something before marriage, you would have had a chance to talk it through and decide, but he didn\u2019t give you that. He doesn\u2019t suddenly have the right to control everything because you signed a marriage certificate. Y W B T A if you caved to his manipulations and made your house inaccessible again. This was something clearly very important to you and Kat, and you\u2019ve mentioned that it\u2019s so rare to have spaces in the world that are genuinely accessible. Despite what your husband says, he is being ableist and an AH. I\u2019d be worried that this is just the start of him trying to manipulate and control you.", "NTA what kind of poor planner is Tom that it never occurred to him to bring this up before the wedding? There are two options here: Tom is that much of a poor planner or he was blandly expecting that once you two were married you would just bend to his will. \n\nDon't give in. The office was enough.", "You want your home accessible not just for your best friend but also for family, all of whom who visit frequently. Your husband insisting that it be remodeled to not be accessible is ableist and that\u2019s a very direct conversation you need to have with him. Disability inclusion isn\u2019t a thing that only happens \u201celsewhere\u201d when you have close friends and family members who are disabled. NTA.", "NTA, but you suck a little. Basically... He pulled a bait and switch, he knew your story and how hard you, Kat, and your families worked to make these welcoming spaces where the two of you could stay connected and he never said a word until he moved in.\n\nBut you really should have talked about this before. I don't just mean that he should have mentioned the renovations; I mean that you needed to actively discuss the living situation and how it would affect your plans as a married couple. This seemed like a brilliant idea 5 years ago, but if you planned to live in this house across from Kat for the rest of your life you really should have made that clear to your fiance. \n\nYou can compromise on taking out the stair lift and not worrying about cooking facilities for her in your house, but does this commitment to her mean you can never move? Does it mean that you HAVE to get the house in the divorce no matter how much money he puts in to convert it to community property? Is there a hard limit on how many kids you can have because there needs to be a bedroom for her to rest when she visits? Do you both have to limit your careers to easy commuting distance of this neighborhood?\n\nYou either intend for this arrangement with Kat to be a lifelong commitment, which is the impression I got from the post, that you really should have told him about... Or you're starting a new chapter of your life and this isn't going to be the last time that you have to make a choice between her needs and your family's. I think that's going to be a hard question for you to ask yourself and I hope it's not too late.", "NTA. He\u2019s deliberately hidden a major flaw from you. Honestly the fact he wants to make things uncomfortable for your best mate speaks volumes about his character.", "NTA but I think you should consider an annulment", "NTA.\n\nThat said, I don't entirely fault your husband for disliking otherwise cumbersome accommodations in the house that nobody who actually lives there needs. As a disabled person myself, those kinds of accommodations are a lifesaver for those of us who need them, but they can often be annoying to those who don't, especially when they're as extensive as what you describe. It's not ableist in and of itself (IMHO) to optimize your own space to your needs/tastes even if that makes the space less accessible to others That said, he's still being unreasonable there for two reasons:\n\n1. he (presumably) knew the house was like that when he moved in.\n2. He's disregarding the fact that the accommodations are for someone you consider family.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have offered him a reasonable compromise, which he disregarded. I will say that the two of you probably should have had a conversation about this before he moved, but that's still not enough to push things into AH territory. I suspect the real issue may be that your husband feels like he's had no say in what is now a communal space and that goes well beyond the disability accommodations.", "NTA - you\u2019re so very right about the value of the house with these modifications. If OP did have to sell the house in the future anyone needing the accommodations would pay gladly for them. If she decided to rent or Airbnb it later she would have a lot of people asking to stay just because it is so hard to find places that are disability friendly", "Agree but I\u2019d go with NAH", "I agree with this and have an additional observation\u2026 There have been many posts about husbands prioritizing their friend\u2019s needs/comfort over their wife\u2019s needs/comfort (e.g. guy who built the room for art, satin sheets guy, perfume guy) and the general consensus has been that they are the AH for putting their friend above their wife (and the nature of the friendship has been questioned).  So what makes this situation different?  OP is putting her friends needs/comfort above her husband\u2019s comfort.  I really am just curious what people see as different in this situation.  Any thoughts?", "It is actually bizarre that not every house is more or less accessible for someone in a wheelchair to visit. Very good of you to do this for Kat.

I\u2019m SO glad I live in a single story space. \nEvery one of you (us, humans) WILL become disabled in some way if we live long enough. Accommodations are indeed something that people will need for themselves or a loved one, and/or could potentially be appealing to a future home buyer.", "Yes! I live in an accessible place because I have close family in a wheelchair and I want them to be able to visit me in my space, and it\u2019s a huge relief to me the idea that if anything were to happen to me I wouldn\u2019t be unable to live in my own home.", "And what if he doesn't? He sprang all this on OP after their marriage---although he'd been in the house a lot before.\n\nSo let's say OP agrees to significant, expensive modifications that exclude Kat---and once they're done, DH suddenly comes up with more demands?

Sorry about your sibling too. I hope they are not in pain.", "You don't understand how marriage works ?", "Really. Is this guy such a catch that OP's friendship with Kat should be trashed so effectively, within months or even weeks of the marriage?", "At one point he lived there for three months.

I think your husband might be struggling with living in \u201eyour house\u201c that you brought into the marriage. This might be either because he didn\u2019t get much say in what the space he lives in feels and looks like or he struggles with not being able to fill the societal ideal of \u201ethe husband being the provider.\u201c \nThat would also explain why it never came up before the wedding.", "Why the hell didn\u2019t he bring it up before you were married?

My best friends, regardless of gender, are all family to me and I will hold them to a high level of importance and hold them highly. \n\n\nHowever I will say that this situation is different because we are talking about accessibility.

They can cook at Kat's house if that's a hobby they share together.", "That seems unnecessarily cruel. I'm disabled and I need certain design modifications but I would never fault friends or family for not wanting to orient their entire houses around my special needs which are not their own.\n\nOP's husband is still an AH for not understanding how important this is to his wife, but I wouldn't say he's a jerk just because he doesn't necessarily feel the house should be designed from the ground up to specifically accommodate someone who doesn't actually live there.", "This!", "Also don\u2019t understand why the friend needs a guest room if she has her own home down the street?  Nor why the kitchen needs to be accessible.  Now that OP is married, isn\u2019t it unlikely that the friend will be cooking and using the kitchen?  And does the friend need to be upstairs as well?  Sounds like OP and friend are used to living in each others pockets, so to speak, and now that OP is married, that\u2019s not her future life.

OP's friend deserves accessibility to every part of OP's house because any other person would be able to do those things. i truly believe every house should be set up like this, but that's a different conversation.
