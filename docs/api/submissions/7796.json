{"id": 7796, "submission_id": "10gkblz", "title": "AITA for refusing to remove disability accommodations from the house I share with my husband?", "selftext": "I (31f) have been best friends with Kat (31f) since we were 6 years old. We grew up and went to uni together, bought homes on the same street, and are basically family in all the ways that matter. She is a very important part of my life and I love her like a sister.\n\nKat is disabled. She has a degenerative condition and has been in a wheelchair since we were in secondary school. Unfortunately, the world often fails to consider accessibility needs. In uni, this meant that there were a lot of limitations on places we could go together because so many places were inaccessible, uncomfortable, and sometimes downright dehumanising. This is why a few years after we graduated, we both decided to move out of our parents' places and buy property on the same street. Our dads and her uncle are tradies and spent nearly 2 years renovating and making both our places accessible. We took it as far as money would allow, and included things like an outdoor kitchen and firepit, a small \"bar\" area etc. It's made a world of difference. We spend a lot of time at each others' places, do cocktail nights, sleepovers, entertain friends, and when her family visit, we have enough rooms between the two of us to accommodate everyone's needs(her mum and brother also have varying degrees of mobility issues). We still go out together, but not as often.\n\nHere's the problem: 4 months ago, I got married to Tom(36). He moved in, and after a few weeks of no problems, we started fighting because he wants us to get rid of the modifications made to the house. He feels they spoil the look of the place, the stair lift chair makes the stairs narrow and he bumps himself when he gets up in the night (this part is true), the roll-under sinks, cooktops and showers are wasting space which could be optimised for storage or additional decor. The bins are annoying because he has to bend to use top handles instead of foot pedals etc.\nHe said it's not ableist to want the things in your house to fit your personal needs, that Kat doesn't live here, and I can just spend time at hers. \n\nI redid the office to make it so he could have a normal room, but it isn't enough.\nI told him that I was willing to compromise and keep only the modifications in the high traffic areas and one accessible bedroom and bathroom, so Kat or a guest could have a room when they visit. It would mean the majority of the house would be redone to his tastes, but it's precisely those areas that he hates the most. \nI refused to completely get rid of everything because these accommodations mean a lot to me and my family, and he said I'm being an AH by treating him like a guest, choosing my friend over my husband, and making selfish decisions without considering him especially since he gave up his condo to live with me.\n\nTLDR: My best friend is disabled. My husband and I aren't. My husband wants to remove all accessibility accommodations that allow Kat to visit comfortably. I refused and upset him", "created_utc": 1674180308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gkblz/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_disability/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is it that he has issues now? He had to of known of how your house was before taking the vows.", "Info:  Was any of this discussed before you moved in togehter? I probably will get voted down for this but I think both of you have valid points. I just don't understand why this wasn't brought up before he gave up his condo and moved in with you.", "NTA\n\nHis point about the house working for those who live there makes sense, except you are a person who lives there too and part of what makes this house work for you is being accessible. He married and moved in with someone who has clearly gone to great lengths to accommodate their friend, then for some reason expected you to reverse all that. You have also offered a compromise where he clearly just wants to take over the space.", "NTA, but you know this isn't about the modifications, right? It sounds like he resents Kat and others for spending so much time in your home and removing the modifications is his way of claiming the space for you and him only. The fact that you didn't immediately choose his needs over the needs of your friend are likely only adding fuel to the fire.\n\nI am extremely close with two friends I have known since we were 11 years old. We had open door policies and basically lived in each other's houses, everything we had was pretty much communal. Then one of my friends married a man who is extremely private and values his space. It fucking sucked at first, but now we hang out other places when we meet, or I actually have to make an appointment so he knows in advance. The other one got married and had a kid, so I can't exactly just drop in anytime day or night anymore either. Relationships change and so do people's boundaries. You need to decide if having your home be accessible to your friends and family is more important than your husband's personal space. If Kat being able to come and go at your place is of paramount importance to you, living with your husband might not work out. If your husband's comfort is more important, then you will have to tell Kat you'll be spending more time at her place. However, I do not think it's unreasonable to leave one bedroom/bathroom accessible, nor some of the less intrusive modifications. Perhaps your husband will compromise if he feels his needs are being recognized.", "NTA. Your husband of four months is trying to drive a wedge between you and your sister. This is a major red flag.\n\n(I know she's not actually your sister, but she is in all the ways that matter)", "NTA. He was aware of these modifications prior to moving in, even prior to getting married, right? I'd call it a complete deal breaker that he is know demanding all sorts of changes be made.", "Info - Did he know about these modifications to the house before moving in?\n\nNTA. If he was already aware of the modifications I don't see why he wouldnt have talked to you about it before willingly moving out of his condo... From reading your others comments also it seems ridiculous for him to expect you to get rid of ALL accommodations, especially seeming as he's aware that this is your life-long friend... He needs to work on communicating his feelings and actually compromise with you.", "NTA.\n\nHe knew about those modifications before you were married and he could have spoken up then.\n\nAnd you never know when those modifications will be helpful in the future.   I know that many years ago, when my grandmother was alive and living in an assisted living facility a few miles from me, I wished I had an accessible place so that I could bring her to my place as a nice change for her.   Unfortunately, I rented, and renovations weren't an option, so that avenue was closed--but I really would have appreciated it.", "INFO: How much time did he spend at your place before he moved in? Did he cook or clean or anything like that? I can see him not realizing how inconvenient things were to him if he hadn't spent much time there.", "ESH-He's wrong for not speaking up earlier, but it seems unrealistic to think you'll never leave the house or move. \n\nIt also sounds like you may prioritize your best friend over your marriage, or that he may think that. There's nothing wrong with doing that, but you shouldn't have gotten married if your best friend always comes first.\n\nYeah, he's being an asshole about the accommodations made to the house, but I bet part of his problem is that he realizes he may come second in his own marriage.\n\n I wonder if he's questioning what will happen if he ever wants to move in the future, or feels like your friend is too involved in both your lives and wants boundaries set.

Nta", "NTA - so your husband wants to completely change the home you own that he had no part in purchasing or renovating?

Waiting until now and his unwillingness to compromise is making his approach to this seem quite manipulative. \n\nI also see comments above saying that he probably has an issue with you having such a close friend. I also find that suspicious and weirdly jealous. Some people went as far as to say they would have a problem with your friendship too, which I totally disagree with and think those commenters should, uh, examine in therapy.\n\nYou say she\u2019s basically your sister. Would he be acting this way if you were \u201creally\u201d related by blood? Honestly I hope you don\u2019t change anything at this point. He should simply not walk into the chair lift! Problem solved!", "NAH. My house was designed to be wheelchair accessible for my grandmother (minus the attic, but that\u2019s storage anyway). Does it suck as a 6\u20192\u201d man who can walk?

Absolutely. 4 months is barely moved in and undoing all of that is a pain and a half.", "NAH \n\nI guess I get Tom enough to not call him an asshole. However why wasn\u2019t this brought up before?", "NTA\n\nYou have had the home this way for many years, and he knew the home was this way when he moved in. \n\nThe fact he wants to remove the items that allow your friend to visit you in your home makes me worry that he will then start to isolate you from your friend.", "NAH. Maybe this wasn't an issue for Tom until he actually started living there and realized how inconvenient the modifications were on a daily basis. Now that it is his home too, maybe removing some of the cumbersome mods would be a reasonable compromise. Like, I get that you're good friends and all...but she lives right down the street. She doesn't need to stay the night or shower at your house ever.", "INFO\n\nWhy does she need to be able to shower at your house?", "NTA\n\nTheres no way he didn't know the mods were there before he decided to move in.\n\nYour friend is basically family, its the same in my opinion if it was your sister or dad.\n\nYou attempted to compromise,  your friend needs the accessibility,  he wants it removed.", "NTA, he knew this was how things were before he moved in. He doesn't get to suddenly change it. Your loved ones need and use the accommodations, that's all that matters here. This is how things were while he was dating you, he should've known this wouldn't suddenly come to a stop any time soon.", "Nta and assuming there was no ultimatum or a gun to his head nobody made him move out of his condo he chose to move into your house", "NAH. It will be a pain in the ass for the first few months as he is getting used to it, but it will be a much bigger pain if you remove it. Although, your friend lives right across the street? It's great that you can accommodate her, but also that seems a bit overkill.", "NAH/YTA border.  Presumably you married your husband by choice but you are treating Kat like an equal SO partner.  Unless you are poly and both of these people are SO's I agree with your husband.  Kat's house needs to be accessible/right for Kat; yours is for you and your (supposed) life partner.  Maybe you need to be re-evaluating who you really want to be with.", "ESH to some extent.\n\nYou want to keep a bedroom that accommodates her disability? I'm not really sure what that entails, but why in the world would your friend ever need to stay overnight at your house now, when she lives down the street? You aren't friends at uni anymore. You are grown adults with your own homes and you also have a spouse living with you. I mean, if you reeeaaally need to spend the night together, go to her house. I feel like there is some weird dynamic here.\n\nAnd why would you be expected to continue to host her disabled family members on occasion, if that means keeping features of your house that your husband (who lives there 100% of the time and presumably pays part of the mortgage) actively dislikes. They can stay at a hotel or other accommodations.\n\nI totally get that your husband does not want a lift chair on the stairs. That's pretty over the top to keep in place unless someone has a disabled family member living there (or visiting very regularly). And if storage is very limited in your kitchen, then yeah, seems like a good idea to build a cabinet under the range. Why does your friend need to access the range? And your husband uses the trashcans/bins multiple times a day, every day, so having one that is most accessible for him is much more important than having an ADA compliant one for your friend's occasional use. I'm sure you could find something that works well for both of them.\n\nThat said, your husband is being asshole-ish for demanding that everything has to be removed and not discussing any of that prior to your marriage. Keeping one bathroom with disability accommodations intact seems like no big deal, if it's not the master bathroom. And keeping the roll-under sink in the kitchen seems reasonable.", "Ew, you need to rethink the husband... He's just gross", "NTA. You and your sister deserve to enjoy your spaces :).

Once the relationship was moving toward marriage, husband could have brought up the accommodations issue in an appropriate way to see how future wife felt about it.", "no, i think decking your house out with a shower and a chair lift to bedrooms to \"accommodate\" someone who doesn't live in that house is bizarre, regardless of the relation.", "those are a lot of what ifs compared to an actual reality: she got married and the family unit decided to live in her house, and neither of them are disabled right now. \n\nif you think someone is inconsiderate and ableist by not having a chair lift and a disabled shower for visitors, then well, i don't know how to help you navigate life and i hope you find someone who can help you.", "The chair is not detachable, but it could be replaced with a newer model which folds up closer parallel to the wall or removed altogether and we only use the downstairs, but this would not be enough. He wants everything removed.", "If any such situation were to arise, we would have that discussion and I would prioritise our relationship. \n\nMoving house for his work would be reasonable, but that's not the situation at hand. The situation is that we are not moving for any reason at the moment, and I seem to be the only person who would like to compromise because right now, it's a complete overhaul of the entire house or nothing", "You're on point.\nIt's like he turned on her.", "You are hearing one side of the story here, and judging it through your experience of a bad relationship. That's your choice. Mine is to judge through my own experience, which is healthy relationships where sometimes there are hard things to work out.", "How is he isolating her? There's nothing that indicates that the friend cannot access her home, nor anything that prevents her from going to her friend's home. (Nor is there any suggestion that the husband is trying to limit the friend relationship in other ways.) And I did state in my own comment that keeping a bathroom set up with accommodations seemed reasonable.\n\nAnd \"completely upheave her entire home\" is quite the overstatement. Removing a stairway lift and adding storage under the kitchen sink and range?", "And this is great for any future house guests with needs- getting rid of EVERYTHING seems really shortsighted", "She doesn't need to, but it's nice that she can. \nIt's a change of environment for her and we can drink or hang out till late without worrying about packing up, etc.\n\nI could live with removing the bigger fixtures and scaling down the fittings to the bare minimum, but removing everything doesn't just mean she can't stay over. It means that she would have trouble simply visiting at all", "This is so weird, do you not have friends who stay over sometimes?", "> and therefore would have had no reason to believe they'd be removed once he moved in unless something had significantly changed in the friend relationship.\n\nthere's another reason, though... because it's now the marital home. \n\nreverse things to see if you'd still agree with your position that marriage doesn't provide \"a reason\" to think that operation of the marital home would be different than prior to marriage: what if they moved into his house, still on the same street, and op now asked for disability modifications to his place so that her friend could visit them in the marital home. \n\ndoesn't seem so bizarre now that such a conversation may never have happened prior to marriage, as if sorting that issue out of a random third-person's comfort in visiting was a condition to marriage, does it?", "Your view of friendship is narrow and pathetic.", "ableist for not having them? nah. ableist for pressuring his wife to take them out when they're already there, she bought the house and paid for them, and there is a current benefit to her and her lifelong friend? yeah lol.\n\nalso hate to say it, but op getting old isn't a what if. that's the future. unless once again god forbid you're expecting her not to live past sixty.\n\nhaving a good one over here looking out for my disabled friends and family and navigating the real world where people are disabled just fine! so thanks for the well wishes but seems you might need them more \ud83e\udd1f", "Have another conversation about what you are willing to compromise on and see if there is an agreement that can be reached. Start off by being realistic about what does get used vs just being there \"in case\". Look at the overall house and the interactions. The backyard seems like it's a full-blown house just out in the open. There's room for negotiation.", "I\u2019m agreeing with the other posters here: your husband didn\u2019t discuss this before marriage, and that\u2019s odd.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like he doesn\u2019t like your close friendship , and now as your husband feels he should have more control over things.  \n\nAt minimum he is not a very good communicator: bottling this up before, or not thinking things through.  At worst it might be the start of more manipulation.", "I'm in a healthy relationship at this point. There is no need for us to work out hard things because we have an open communication. Hardest thing we currently have to decide is what we want for supper. OP got whammied out of left field with this. It would be a no go for me with his demands and lack od communication.", "IMO only the living room and at least one toilet need to be accessible. She does not need to cook in your house, go upstairs, sleepover or take a shower.", "Friends? Yes. Friends who live on my street? Never.", "Agreed. Either you die young, in which case whoever owns OP's house after her death can do what they want with it, or you become old, and no one is able-bodied forever. Those are the only two options.", "Or he just didn't realize how all this would effect him until he was living there full time.", "I agree that I think the husband might also have a problem with the close friendship. I will be honest I probably would too, but if I did I wouldn't marry the person. OP post and comments sounds like she is planning on building a life with Kat and not her husband IMO. I think he should have spoken up about any issues he had with the house or their friendship before getting married, but I think a lot of couples do this. They assume that marriage will automatically change things. Will automatically make the other person put them first in a relationship. If that's not happening before marriage I don't think anyone should assume that it will automatically change once they are married. I have to say if I expressed issues with our home and the compromise was to just give me one room that was remodeled to fit my perference I wouldn't feel like it was really my home. I'm sure I will get voted down for my opinion but I don't really think it's about the house being accessible for her friend as much as it feels like the friend is more of a priority to OP than her husband.", "And it hasn't occurred to you that someone who is a wheelchair user might find it easier to crash at their friends house, even if their own is on the same street?", "But one is a want and one is a need. The friend needs certain accommodations to enter the house. And at minimum they should have access to the common spaces, kitchen, a bathroom etc. Maybe there\u2019s room to change the trash bin so she puts waste in a countertop bin and you throw it away after. But having access to the sink to wash hands seems necessary. If he will compromise, you could probably address at least many of the concerns. But her basic access should be preserved", "I agree with you!", "Did you mean to comment this elsewhere? How does this follow?"]}
