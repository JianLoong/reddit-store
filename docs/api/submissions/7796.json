{"id": 7796, "submission_id": "10gkblz", "title": "AITA for refusing to remove disability accommodations from the house I share with my husband?", "selftext": "I (31f) have been best friends with Kat (31f) since we were 6 years old. We grew up and went to uni together, bought homes on the same street, and are basically family in all the ways that matter. She is a very important part of my life and I love her like a sister.\n\nKat is disabled. She has a degenerative condition and has been in a wheelchair since we were in secondary school. Unfortunately, the world often fails to consider accessibility needs. In uni, this meant that there were a lot of limitations on places we could go together because so many places were inaccessible, uncomfortable, and sometimes downright dehumanising. This is why a few years after we graduated, we both decided to move out of our parents' places and buy property on the same street. Our dads and her uncle are tradies and spent nearly 2 years renovating and making both our places accessible. We took it as far as money would allow, and included things like an outdoor kitchen and firepit, a small \"bar\" area etc. It's made a world of difference. We spend a lot of time at each others' places, do cocktail nights, sleepovers, entertain friends, and when her family visit, we have enough rooms between the two of us to accommodate everyone's needs(her mum and brother also have varying degrees of mobility issues). We still go out together, but not as often.\n\nHere's the problem: 4 months ago, I got married to Tom(36). He moved in, and after a few weeks of no problems, we started fighting because he wants us to get rid of the modifications made to the house. He feels they spoil the look of the place, the stair lift chair makes the stairs narrow and he bumps himself when he gets up in the night (this part is true), the roll-under sinks, cooktops and showers are wasting space which could be optimised for storage or additional decor. The bins are annoying because he has to bend to use top handles instead of foot pedals etc.\nHe said it's not ableist to want the things in your house to fit your personal needs, that Kat doesn't live here, and I can just spend time at hers. \n\nI redid the office to make it so he could have a normal room, but it isn't enough.\nI told him that I was willing to compromise and keep only the modifications in the high traffic areas and one accessible bedroom and bathroom, so Kat or a guest could have a room when they visit. It would mean the majority of the house would be redone to his tastes, but it's precisely those areas that he hates the most. \nI refused to completely get rid of everything because these accommodations mean a lot to me and my family, and he said I'm being an AH by treating him like a guest, choosing my friend over my husband, and making selfish decisions without considering him especially since he gave up his condo to live with me.\n\nTLDR: My best friend is disabled. My husband and I aren't. My husband wants to remove all accessibility accommodations that allow Kat to visit comfortably.

Why is it that he has issues now? He had to of known of how your house was before taking the vows.", "Info:  Was any of this discussed before you moved in togehter? I probably will get voted down for this but I think both of you have valid points. I just don't understand why this wasn't brought up before he gave up his condo and moved in with you.", "NTA\n\nHis point about the house working for those who live there makes sense, except you are a person who lives there too and part of what makes this house work for you is being accessible. He married and moved in with someone who has clearly gone to great lengths to accommodate their friend, then for some reason expected you to reverse all that. You have also offered a compromise where he clearly just wants to take over the space.", "NTA, but you know this isn't about the modifications, right? It sounds like he resents Kat and others for spending so much time in your home and removing the modifications is his way of claiming the space for you and him only. The fact that you didn't immediately choose his needs over the needs of your friend are likely only adding fuel to the fire.\n\nI am extremely close with two friends I have known since we were 11 years old. We had open door policies and basically lived in each other's houses, everything we had was pretty much communal. Then one of my friends married a man who is extremely private and values his space. It fucking sucked at first, but now we hang out other places when we meet, or I actually have to make an appointment so he knows in advance. The other one got married and had a kid, so I can't exactly just drop in anytime day or night anymore either. Relationships change and so do people's boundaries. You need to decide if having your home be accessible to your friends and family is more important than your husband's personal space. If Kat being able to come and go at your place is of paramount importance to you, living with your husband might not work out. If your husband's comfort is more important, then you will have to tell Kat you'll be spending more time at her place. However, I do not think it's unreasonable to leave one bedroom/bathroom accessible, nor some of the less intrusive modifications. Perhaps your husband will compromise if he feels his needs are being recognized.", "NTA. Your husband of four months is trying to drive a wedge between you and your sister. This is a major red flag.\n\n(I know she's not actually your sister, but she is in all the ways that matter)", "NTA. He was aware of these modifications prior to moving in, even prior to getting married, right? I'd call it a complete deal breaker that he is know demanding all sorts of changes be made.", "Info - Did he know about these modifications to the house before moving in?\n\nNTA. If he was already aware of the modifications I don't see why he wouldnt have talked to you about it before willingly moving out of his condo... From reading your others comments also it seems ridiculous for him to expect you to get rid of ALL accommodations, especially seeming as he's aware that this is your life-long friend... He needs to work on communicating his feelings and actually compromise with you.", "NTA.\n\nHe knew about those modifications before you were married and he could have spoken up then.\n\nAnd you never know when those modifications will be helpful in the future.   I know that many years ago, when my grandmother was alive and living in an assisted living facility a few miles from me, I wished I had an accessible place so that I could bring her to my place as a nice change for her.   Unfortunately, I rented, and renovations weren't an option, so that avenue was closed--but I really would have appreciated it.", "INFO: How much time did he spend at your place before he moved in? Did he cook or clean or anything like that? I can see him not realizing how inconvenient things were to him if he hadn't spent much time there.", "ESH-He's wrong for not speaking up earlier, but it seems unrealistic to think you'll never leave the house or move. \n\nIt also sounds like you may prioritize your best friend over your marriage, or that he may think that. There's nothing wrong with doing that, but you shouldn't have gotten married if your best friend always comes first.\n\nYeah, he's being an asshole about the accommodations made to the house, but I bet part of his problem is that he realizes he may come second in his own marriage.\n\n I wonder if he's questioning what will happen if he ever wants to move in the future, or feels like your friend is too involved in both your lives and wants boundaries set.

Nta", "NTA - so your husband wants to completely change the home you own that he had no part in purchasing or renovating?

Waiting until now and his unwillingness to compromise is making his approach to this seem quite manipulative. \n\nI also see comments above saying that he probably has an issue with you having such a close friend. I also find that suspicious and weirdly jealous. Some people went as far as to say they would have a problem with your friendship too, which I totally disagree with and think those commenters should, uh, examine in therapy.\n\nYou say she\u2019s basically your sister. Would he be acting this way if you were \u201creally\u201d related by blood? Honestly I hope you don\u2019t change anything at this point. He should simply not walk into the chair lift! Problem solved!", "NAH. My house was designed to be wheelchair accessible for my grandmother (minus the attic, but that\u2019s storage anyway). Does it suck as a 6\u20192\u201d man who can walk?

Absolutely. 4 months is barely moved in and undoing all of that is a pain and a half.", "NAH \n\nI guess I get Tom enough to not call him an asshole. However why wasn\u2019t this brought up before?", "NTA\n\nYou have had the home this way for many years, and he knew the home was this way when he moved in. \n\nThe fact he wants to remove the items that allow your friend to visit you in your home makes me worry that he will then start to isolate you from your friend.", "NAH. Maybe this wasn't an issue for Tom until he actually started living there and realized how inconvenient the modifications were on a daily basis. Now that it is his home too, maybe removing some of the cumbersome mods would be a reasonable compromise. Like, I get that you're good friends and all...but she lives right down the street. She doesn't need to stay the night or shower at your house ever.", "INFO\n\nWhy does she need to be able to shower at your house?", "NTA\n\nTheres no way he didn't know the mods were there before he decided to move in.\n\nYour friend is basically family, its the same in my opinion if it was your sister or dad.\n\nYou attempted to compromise,  your friend needs the accessibility,  he wants it removed.", "NTA, he knew this was how things were before he moved in. He doesn't get to suddenly change it. Your loved ones need and use the accommodations, that's all that matters here. This is how things were while he was dating you, he should've known this wouldn't suddenly come to a stop any time soon.", "Nta and assuming there was no ultimatum or a gun to his head nobody made him move out of his condo he chose to move into your house", "NAH. It will be a pain in the ass for the first few months as he is getting used to it, but it will be a much bigger pain if you remove it. Although, your friend lives right across the street? It's great that you can accommodate her, but also that seems a bit overkill.", "NAH/YTA border.  Presumably you married your husband by choice but you are treating Kat like an equal SO partner.  Unless you are poly and both of these people are SO's I agree with your husband.  Kat's house needs to be accessible/right for Kat; yours is for you and your (supposed) life partner.  Maybe you need to be re-evaluating who you really want to be with.", "ESH to some extent.\n\nYou want to keep a bedroom that accommodates her disability? I'm not really sure what that entails, but why in the world would your friend ever need to stay overnight at your house now, when she lives down the street? You aren't friends at uni anymore. You are grown adults with your own homes and you also have a spouse living with you. I mean, if you reeeaaally need to spend the night together, go to her house. I feel like there is some weird dynamic here.\n\nAnd why would you be expected to continue to host her disabled family members on occasion, if that means keeping features of your house that your husband (who lives there 100% of the time and presumably pays part of the mortgage) actively dislikes. They can stay at a hotel or other accommodations.\n\nI totally get that your husband does not want a lift chair on the stairs. That's pretty over the top to keep in place unless someone has a disabled family member living there (or visiting very regularly). And if storage is very limited in your kitchen, then yeah, seems like a good idea to build a cabinet under the range. Why does your friend need to access the range? And your husband uses the trashcans/bins multiple times a day, every day, so having one that is most accessible for him is much more important than having an ADA compliant one for your friend's occasional use. I'm sure you could find something that works well for both of them.\n\nThat said, your husband is being asshole-ish for demanding that everything has to be removed and not discussing any of that prior to your marriage. Keeping one bathroom with disability accommodations intact seems like no big deal, if it's not the master bathroom. And keeping the roll-under sink in the kitchen seems reasonable.", "Ew, you need to rethink the husband... He's just gross", "NTA. You and your sister deserve to enjoy your spaces :).

It sounds like he has a problem with your sister friend.", "So, he knew all of this before you two married? Why did he wait until after wedding to complain. Your home is designed to your tsste.

Yes he should feel home there too but not at the extent to shut out your people not matter how far or close they live. Marrying him doesn't undo the life you had before with family and friends, so it not unreasonable to expect him to compromise on a way to keep them in your life (which includes hosting them). Maybe I'm overreacting but this gives off a very controlling vibe. I assume he knew about your friend/family relationships before marriage, I'm not sure how far he's taking it but eg remove ramp or stuff so some people are banned completely or can't go to toilet for decorative reasons is a terrible suggestion", "NTA.

He knew what he was moving into, and should have brought it up before moving in. You've also offered a very reasonable compromise. I suspect this insistence is more about him keeping Kat away.

It can and should be a dealbreaker if you can't work it out.", "It looks like you\u2019re getting a lot of interesting and thoughtful comments, which is great! \n\nI say NTA rather than N A H because even though I understand that your husband would want to live in a space that makes him comfortable, his unwillingness to consider ANY of your very reasonable compromises tells me that this is about something else entirely, and his heart is possibly not in the right place here. He needs to be willing to make plans WITH you, and to consider that while you two are theoretically the most important people in each other\u2019s lives, your friend is ALSO your family, and you\u2019re never going to diminish that. \n\nAlso, it feels icky to me that within the span of what, FOUR MONTHS, your husband has gone from not mentioning having a problem at all to \u201cevery carefully planned accommodation has to go.\u201d That, again, speaks to this not really being about his actual comfort in his home but more about control\u2026 or something.", "Nta.

That feels weird to me", "I get it, not everybody wants stair lifts in their home, and some of the accessibility stuff can be kind of ugly.\n\nBut we're talking about his inconvenience vs. stuff that probably makes a very significant difference to Kat's quality of life.\n\nI'm going NTA. \n\nTom may not be an asshole here, but he is failing to see the bigger picture, that he could be a bit kinder to Kat simply by leaving the status quo as it is.", "NTA and honestly I think you\u2019re being too accommodating of your new husband\u2019s desire to block Kat out of your space. Which is what his request would result in, even if somehow it his not his intent (and I highly doubt it is _not_ his intent)\n\nYou should also take a look at the property laws where you live.

He already knew about how much this relationship means to you and how much more difficult visits will be without accomendations. And frankly, some of his problems sound a bit petty, like having to bend over instead of having a step can. He seems insecure in the relationship and to sort through his emotions about that.\n\nNow that being said, it sounds like the accommodations, even in the compromise, are a bit excessive. You are reserving her an entire room and bathroom in the home as well as outfitting every other room in it, to fit her needs, and giving him one office.  Not to mention,  are you still planning on having regular sleepovers, all three of you? And having her family over, too? Personally, if I was building a new family together with my partner and they  spent all their time with another person and had every room in my home to fit this other person's needs and not mine. I'd feel like a third wheel too.\n\nMy suggestion is removing the hardware like the stair lift and other bulkier items and storing them away and maybe even halt the sleepovers for a while until you two settle more into married life and he gets more secure in his home. She has her own home, and there is no reason you can't visit her instead.

He doesn't value her and he doesn't value the part of you that loves her.\n\nYou need to have a serious talk about these issues, possibly with a lawyer nearby. He has added no value whatsoever to your house and your interest in it needs protection.", "NTA. BTW \u2026 who owns this house? Whose name is on the paperwork? Yours, right?

You\u2019ve known each other basically for as long as you can actually remember. I have two friends like that (friends since I was seven and I\u2019m about to turn thirty) and they are more sisters to me than friends. If they had mobility difficulties I would be setting my house up in a way they could access it. \n\nSecond, when you have a close relationship with a person who uses a wheelchair you start to see spaces differently. My MIL uses a wheelchair exclusively due to an amputation and going places with her gave me a real eye opener on how many places in public and in average homes are not accessible.  You want your very close friend to be able to exist comfortably in common places in your home and have good access to a bedroom and bathroom. That\u2019s very reasonable. \n\nYou offered what sounds to me like a good compromise. Modify the areas your friend or other guests don\u2019t need to access to suit your husband\u2019s tastes. But I think it\u2019s an understandable ask that the spaces you indicated stay mobility friendly. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like the look of open spaces under counters maybe suggest decorative curtains that can be pulled back when needed. My in laws have these in their home because they prefer the look. If you\u2019re willing to spend a decent amount you could even look into some kind of pocket cabinet doors that slide away- although those would almost certainly be pretty expensive. But keeping the modifications in common areas and a guest room and a bathroom is completely reasonable. \n\nHe knew about the house set up before hand. He knows the reasons why. Living together means a compromise on how spaces are arranged. But the key here is compromise. You\u2019re willing to do so. He should be willing to compromise as well.", "NTA.

Accessibility will literally only make your home more valuable and ensure you can live in it longer, which it sounds like you intended this to be your forever home if life will allow it. \n\nI do think it would be wise to look into modifying the stair lift to have a seat that folds up, for everyone's convenience and safety though. Bumping into it in the night on the stairs doesn't sound very safe, so some night lights along the edge of the stairs may be good idea too.", "NTA. Awfully suspect, your husband only complaining about these things post-nuptials. Almost as if he's always had complaints but waited until you were tied down to demand changes.

Does it mean that you HAVE to get the house in the divorce no matter how much money he puts in to convert it to community property? Is there a hard limit on how many kids you can have because there needs to be a bedroom for her to rest when she visits?

As a disabled person myself, those kinds of accommodations are a lifesaver for those of us who need them, but they can often be annoying to those who don't, especially when they're as extensive as what you describe. It's not ableist in and of itself (IMHO) to optimize your own space to your needs/tastes even if that makes the space less accessible to others That said, he's still being unreasonable there for two reasons:\n\n1. he (presumably) knew the house was like that when he moved in.\n2. He's disregarding the fact that the accommodations are for someone you consider family.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have offered him a reasonable compromise, which he disregarded. I will say that the two of you probably should have had a conversation about this before he moved, but that's still not enough to push things into AH territory.

So what makes this situation different?  OP is putting her friends needs/comfort above her husband\u2019s comfort.  I really am just curious what people see as different in this situation.  Any thoughts?\n\nEdit to add:  To be clear, I absolutely think OP should be able to keep the accommodations in her home for her friend.

OPs husband uses the trash can way more often than the friend I imagine, it not fair for him to be uncomfortable on a daily basis. Not saying they should change the whole place but perhaps a few things", "OP has been doing it all along with no apparent issue, so it's not an insurmountable obstacle. They all can use the house, hubby CAN adapt but doesn't want to. He wants to demand OP make her house inaccessible to her friend for an extra degree of comfort on his part. This is a power move to make OP 'prove' she obeys his whims more than her need for Kat's friendship.", "He said he wants to remove accessibility features in the bathroom so they can put \"decor\" there...\n\nThat is just pathetic to me.  The chair on the stairs might be an issue, someone suggested changing it to a folding chair so it doesn't stick out as much...  but changing things so you can stick some ugly vase or something, in a corner, is ridiculous.\n\nI think the husband has an underlying issue and is taking it out on the accessibility features.  Either he's trying to separate OP from her friend because he's controlling, or he's feeing a loss of control over his life after getting married and moving into someone else's house.  Maybe he just misses having his own space, or alone time, and is lashing out by picking on the accessibility stuff.\n\nIf it's the later, they need to have some deep talks and find another way for him to handle his emotions.  If it's the former, OP is in for some trouble.", "That\u2019s such a good point. My parents built our house with only one bathroom, on the second floor, and no bedroom space on the ground floor (which you also need to navigate an unpaved path and porch stairs just to get inside). Then my dad got a brain cyst that was mistaken for a stroke and spent months in the hospital. He had to relearn how to walk. There was a high chance he would be coming home in a wheelchair. So my mom had to find the money and resources to have a contractor friend add on a ground floor bedroom and bathroom, in the middle of winter, as fast as possible before the insurance ran out and made my dad come home. It ended up being a wonderful addition to the house and turned out lovely, but it was rushed and not necessarily done to code, so if they ever sell it will be an issue. And my dad managed a miraculous recovery and refused to ever use that bathroom or bedroom (I think he was a little offended that someone else had added onto the house he had built with his own two hands, and saw many flaws in it). But god, that was such a stressful time for our family. You can become disabled in the blink of an eye, so much better to plan ahead.", "Im not disabled and I agree.  He knew what it looked it\u2026he had more than enough time.  He resents her friend\u2019s disability, and has been lying in ambush all this time, waiting for a piece of paper that says their bond has the final stay.  There is no way this \u201csudden\u201d disturbance wasn\u2019t planned.  Many people treat the disabled like an after thought, and a nuisance without even a second thought, not even considering how the modifications might be of help to them or their family in the future.  Like what\u2019s the problem\u2026higher toilet?  Accessible sinks? A wider door?  God forbid.  I have been in accessible homes and they are not all the same.  I have had very little issue navigating my way around and actually liked a lot of the modifications (during my home health days).  People are shit, it just sucks that she got married to him first before she found out.  OP is NTA in my opinion.", "Honestly, this sub has a lot of ableist people. Being disabled for the most part is just people not respecting your needs at all, and it doesn\u2019t matter where you are at in life. I was valedictorian of my high school class, got into one of America\u2019s best colleges for undergrad, and I now have an acceptance at a top law school and am well on course to graduate from my undergrad a year early. Still, I get almost no respect for my accommodations and needs by professors, teachers, and general people on the street. Even a minor disability can be a complete pain in the ass, and it honestly maybe one of the worst things to deal with. I understand it\u2019s the husband\u2019s house too, but he really should respect her relationship with her friend, because the worst feeling as someone with a disability is to be told no, you can\u2019t go there. It maybe be a bit less comfortable than desired, and she should probably consider possibly rearranging what places have the accommodation parts, but he should support her decision to support her friend.", "OP has proposed changing a lot of things! Husband wants to eliminate *all* the accommodations that make it possible for Kat to come into the house and participate fully in social activities with OP. And the issue isn\u2019t necessarily physical pain-OP doesn\u2019t mention back pain, and a brief bend to toss something a couple times a day just isn\u2019t that hard for an able-bodied person. (My spouse is 54 and a full two metres and somehow manages to use lower cabinets and such.) \n\nThe accommodations are as much for OP as for Kat. When OP hosts get-togethers where folks cook together and hang out for hours, OP gets the pleasure of her company at the same level and for the same amount of time as other guests. If OP\u2019s husband gets his way, OP won\u2019t get to have Kat over on an equal basis with her other friends or host the gatherings she enjoys, and Kat will have to take the whole burden of hosting any event she attends. Eff that. Husband needs to get over his My Way/Highway attitude and respect that in his wife\u2019s house, disability is accommodated.", "or maybe they could just get him one tall trash can that he can fill and empty himself instead of taking away her accomodation. or he can just bend over and put it in a little lower. kat is uncomfortable everywhere else she goes besides her own home, and now OP's. at least she has two known safe places to exist. like. it's different because husband is able bodied. he can handle accomodations but she literally cannot handle without. and his discomfort is a lot less than hers. i don't feel bad for him. sorry.", "\"OP has been doing it all along with no apparent issue...\" And if Op is a short 5'2\" while the husband towers at 6'+, wouldn't that be understandable?   He just wants to be able to comfortably use the space he lives in."]}
