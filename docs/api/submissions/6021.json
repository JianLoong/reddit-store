When she was placed with us we were told by one of her two case workers at the time (more on this later) that the half siblings were offered up sibling visitation with her but none of them had been interested and they had shut down all offers to speak to or stay in touch with my daughter. They were given her (the case worker's) contact info at the time and told to reach out if they changed their mind so she could facilitate this.\n\nShe had been almost a year in foster care when she came to us. She'd had five foster families. Never had contact with these half siblings. But somewhere along the way she ended up with two case workers at the same time. The one I mentioned above who was amazing and communicated a lot with us and was fantastic for getting our daughter the correct support and then there was another case worker called Mia. Mia we actually did not know or meet for months. This was when we flagged that our daughter had two case workers. Sometime in the months of being her case worker, Mia had told our daughter about her half siblings (she didn't remember them) and had implied that they were too young to get to stay in touch and that they would have loved contact with her. My husband and I found out about this a few months ago. Mia is long out of the picture. So is the other social worker because our daughter is now fully, legally our daughter. But she came to us about what she had been told by Mia and how she was going to start looking for her half siblings when she turned 18. She said it made her sad that their dad hadn't wanted them to see her but in a few months they would all be adults and could get to know each other.\n\nMy husband and I decided to tell her what we had been told, and the information we were given at the time she was placed with us. She was upset because for many years she thought about the one day she would get her Hallmark or Disney like reunion with them and she always believed they had no choice in not having anything to do with her. We told her she could still reach out if she wanted and we would support her but we wanted to prepare her just in case. She understood and was appreciative. But a couple of members of my extended family, specifically my SIL who has a blended family with my brother and was part of an adoptive blended family as a child said we had badmouthed the siblings and attempted to alienate her from her biological family members, the only ones she has, and that we are cruel, etc.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672404783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyztz3/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_the_truth_about_her/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And more lol.\n\nI hope it goes well for your daughter. If it doesn\u2019t, having you by her side will ensure she knows she\u2019s loved. Good luck :)", "NTA. You were adjusting your daughter's expectations to a more realistic level. That protects her, to some degree, from being hurt, if she does reach out for her half-siblings and they don't want anything to do with her. Anyway, who knows? Their situations and attitudes may have changed since then, but it is good to be forewarned.", "NTA. It seems that you made the best decisions appropriate for the age she was at, and given the lack of interest by the siblings to maintain contact. Not telling her when she was younger and then telling her when she was older was appropriate.", "NTa you sound very supportive in every way, does your SIL want the girl to be rejected without any warning when that blow could have been cushioned. That is cruel and also none of her business. You are the girls parents and it's your call not theirs.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSIL is an AH. You were telling her THE TRUTH.", "NTA\nIt is better for her to have all the facts.", "NAH. You told her what you know. However, keep in mind that people change their minds. Her siblings may regret that decision and could want to see her now. \n\nI recommend she go to counseling. Family counseling (with you) mah also be helpful. She needs someone that specializes in adoption. Since she is not yet 18, you have a number of options for this because (I\u2019m assuming) your daughter qualifies to receive Title IV-E adoption assistance. In addition, in my state (Texas), adoption agencies are required to provide post-adopt services after adoption is finalized and before the child turns 18. This may also be an option in your state.\n\nAlso, know that she\u2019s not wanting to look for her biological siblings because of anything you did or did not do as a parent.", "NTA. You are trying to act in the best interest of your daughter. At this point you really can\u2019t know if she was told correctly and you were misinformed or vice versa. And whatever the siblings may have thought or wanted at the time surely could change 10 years later. You sound like wonderful parents. Support your daughter through her journey, no matter what hard or wonderful truths she learns about who they were then or who they are now or who they might become in the future. Life is long. Be there for her holding her hand every time she wants or needs you, and let her fly every time she wants or needs that.", "NTA \n\nIt is better for your daughter to go into this with a realistic mindset vs the fairy tale that Mia made up for some reason.", "Nta who the hell let\u2019s a family member go to foster care???

BUT in reality, it is more likely they've tried to give her no thought at all.  \n\nYour SIL is a fool to believe you did this to cause harm.", "YTA. Yes you should prepare her for potential (and it is potential only) rejectionbut not in the manner you did\n\n It was a decade earlier, where the siblings had also lost their mother and were likely very young adults. You don't know what happened in that family prior to the parents death and what situations the siblings were in. You only have the word of one case worker, that differs from another case workers information. \n\nYou can prepare her without vilifying her biological family. You could have gone to shared therapy to discuss potential rejection. Explained they have their own lives and might not like the reminder of their passed mother. Instead you made it into a black and white thing, making it sound (the way you have worded it here) like there is no room for change or nuance.", "That was my thinking but was starting to doubt my choice. We just didn't want her to go into this expecting them to be overjoyed and talk about how they had always missed and wanted her and then to be slapped with reality, especially because we have no way of knowing if they would be kind about it or not. Thank you for your response.", "Thank you for your response. I appreciate hearing this side because I have had some niggling doubts over this. I never ever wanted to vilify the half siblings. My only intention was to protect my daughter and help her have a slightly more realistic outlook on what she could be facing. Based on the information from the case worker who actually spoke to the three half siblings in question vs the case worker who had not and was not known to us until after she had told our daughter all this information, that she did not share with us at all.", "When you are hearing second hand information, you should take it with a pinch of salt. Even with the best will in the world, things can be lost in translation. You were not party to the conversation. Case workers can try to morally manipulate to get placements, again you were not party to the conversations.  You didn't speak to them yourself. \n\nYou evidently hold some resentment for them (based on your original wording). Which is expected as a mom who is protective of a child in foster for a year with living siblings. But, they were likely a little older than your daughter now? Is she mature enough to make lifelong relationship decisions while grieving. \n\nMaybe they will reject her, maybe some of them will reject her or maybe they will accept just one meeting out of curiosity and drop her. You don't know.\n\nI understand your urge to protect her from disappointment. And you are right, it is likely not going to be a Disney ending. And she needs preparation. But it just sounded like you gave her that rejection anyways. And made it sound like they rejected her (as a person), rather than being emotional beings who make decisions to emotionally protect themselves, that have nothing to do with her as a person.  And removed any (even small chance) of a successful reunification with a sibling.", "I don't hold resentment toward them. I do toward Mia who set her up with these things, not having met the half siblings, and lying about the circumstances, then not telling anyone else what she told a small child who had so much instability. She set my daughter up with a big expectation and there were lies in there even if she meant well in any way.\n\nThey were in their 20s at the time. Still young but yes, not all that much older than my daughter is currently.\n\nI also did offer to support her in finding them. All I wanted was for her expectation not to be that they would say how they had always wanted to know her (which she believed) and that their dad kept them away because they were under 18 when her parents died.", "Fair enough, hopefully she goes through with it, because it's like a bandage, quicker to rip it off and find out, then to wander over it for years. I am confused. \n\nBut a bit confused, If they were under 18 when the parents died. And she was in foster for a year before coming to you, when did the case worker have the conversation, for them to be in their 20s.", "The social worker who spoke to my daughter said they were kids under 18 and that they lived with their dad and he didn't want them to have access. What I was told is they were in their 20s and that's what was in her file information as well, not what my daughter was told. That's why I am inclined to believe what I was told more, there's written documentation of the refusal coming from the adult siblings. What my daughter was told was never written down anywhere and I know there were some lies told there at least.", "NTA. (Maybe NAH?) I don't know why the half siblings didn't want to connect, but I don't think there's anything wrong with letting her know that it might not be possible. I have a few adopted cousins, and one of them has spent so much time and energy futilely trying to reconnect with her birth mom who just.... is not interested. It's hard to watch.", "NTA, i don't think this was such a huge surprise for your daughter. She is 17 now, i'm sure she already wondered why her half siblings didn't reached out to her when they were old enough to decide for themselfs. Your SIL is just projecting.", "NTA", "SIL can butt out. The siblings alienated themselves. It will be a lot worse if your daughter reaches out expecting love and gets a door inexplicably slammed in her face. NTA and good on you guys for being honest and loving parents.", "You sound like great parents!", "NTA.  What Mia did is unethical and your SIL has no business getting involved.  At best, she's projecting.\n\nAll you did was prepare *your* daughter, for some potential unpleasantness and allow her to make her own decision.  You know, what a parent is *supposed* to do...", "NTA. It\u2019s better coming from you than her trying to reach out and getting shut down. I\u2019m glad you are willing to support her either way she wants to go.", "NTA. I\u2019m adopted and was lied to about a lot of things. I resent my adopted family because of it. To this day, my bio-dads family and I have no idea how I ended up with my adopted family or even my adoption was legal. I could have had a great family instead of the abusive home I grew up in. So bottom line- you are showing a respect for your daughter that is rare. Don\u2019t stop that.", "NYA, You told the truth about the information you were given to prepare and protect your daughter. Disregard what SIL thinks!", "OP said they\u2019re willing to support her in finding her siblings", "I wouldn't even want to fathom the devastation your daughter could have gone through had she not learned the truth before hand & had reached out with unrealistic expectations. She can learn to articulate what she wants to convey if she still wants to unlock that door but the ball will be in her siblings court & if they still want no contact then at least she'll be somewhat prepared & know she'll have you & your husband to confide in.", "NTA\n\nI have a family history that's a little hard to hear. There was the time before I knew, and the time after I knew. What I have learned from this is that, there is no such thing as protecting someone from the truth. It's just a justification for lying by omission.", "Adoptive mom here.  I would have done the exact same thing.  You were not cruel. You simply told the truth, something others had denied her.  NTA.", "NTA, telling someone the truth isnt badmouthing. Sometimes when you adopt you have great results and a bigger family. Sometimes they grow into an AH and get mad at things that arent their concern. No one elses opinion matters except your daughters. If she appreciated it then it doesnt matter if every other child in the world that was adopted would hate being told.", "NTA. If her siblings haven't changed their minds, she would have been much more disappointed without you giving her a warning. It's good that you prepared for the fact that they might not want a relationship with her. \n\nYour sister probably has good intentions, given that she has a similar familial situation to yours, but she is going about it the wrong way. She needs to understand that every family is different, and that she doesn't have to like your choices.", "NTA. It's better to have her go in with realistic expectations and support.  Wishing for the best", "NTA I'm adopted and a psych nurse.  I fully believe you did the right thing.  Your daughter had unrealistic expectations set by Mia and she needed to know that wasn't the mindset of her siblings at that time.  Hopefully, the siblings have grown and may want contact.  You did great!", "NTA - it you wouldn\u2019t have told her the truth, maybe it will get very painful for her when she gets to know her half siblings :/ but speaking the truth can also be painful, though it\u2019s needed sometimes", "NAH.  I get what you were doing, but maybe you could have taken a softer tack, saying that what Mia said was contradictory to what the actual caseworker who contacted the half-siblings said and to be prepared in case the half-siblings do not want contact.", "NTA  \n\n\nall you did was provide her with the information you had to prepare her for the worst, nothing wrong with that", "NTA. But it's possible that wasn\u2019t the full story. If you phrased it as -- \"This is the information we have, but there could be more information or context we're not aware of. We understand you wanting to meet your siblings and we're going to help support you every step of the way.\" -- then I think you did fine.\n\nInfo: Can you get a counselor who has experience in these issues? It would be good to have one on hand for your daughter. Search & reunion can be a rollercoaster of experiences & feelings.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly.", "NAH", "NTA.", "Plenty of people. If the grown siblings were still teenagers, they might have been barely able to support themselves, let alone a child.\n\nMaybe a 19 year old working minimum wage and living with four roommates (for example) would struggle to take in a six year old?", "Getting custody of a child is a big job, it's hard, especially in the US where you have to prove you can pay for it. If they're all young, maybe some of them were in college, maybe one of them is on SSI, maybe they thought another family could give her a better shot than theirs could. Exposing a child to an ongoing custody battle and/or poverty isn't exactly saintlike behavior either.", "Additionally, if it came out that you knew how the siblings felt and didn't tell her, she would probably feel betrayed by you. NTA, you did the right thing.", "You did the right thing not to mention, If the siblings were already adults when she reached out she would have realised she had ready been lied to by their ages wouldn't she? NTA you even said you would support her in reaching out. Your SIL is projecting her own feelings.", "They could have not wanted to interfere with her new life, or drag her into another custody situation by exposing her to other family members that were out of the picture. There's still a chance they'd like to meet her and check in as adults, but you were right o temper expectations."]}
