There might be a standard $50 cap, or maybe he really is the cheapskate but it doesn't sound like you have enough info to really judge.\n\nMy husbands family has a 'draw a name' for Christmas the limit is $50.  Every employed adult only buys 1 present for 1 specific person.  We buy gifts for our spouses, and things for 'the kids'.", "Based on the info you provide here, YTA. I would think ~$50 per person is quite normal for people in their 20s (at least it is for me and the people I know).

The only way he\u2019s the AH in this situation is if he\u2019s asking you to buy big presents for them and then cheaping out on what he\u2019s doing. \n\nAlso, based on the numbers you gave, he makes ~$85k? That\u2019s a good salary, but far from an amount where someone should be expected to blow $500 on gifts for two people.\n\nEdit: The information in this post has changed massively since I commented this.

But you do not seem to have any consideration for what is normal in his family. My family does well enough, but would be horrified at the thought of anyone spending $500 on a Christmas gift. It would be seen as gauche and wasteful. My husband's family hand-makes all their gifts (most of them are artists or craftspeople) and it would be weird to buy anything. This was a culture shock for me when we spent our first Christmas with them, as I can't make shit.\n\nYou and your \"FH\" need to talk this out. What does his family expect? Is that expectation reasonable? When you get married, are expectations going to change?\n\nI'll be honest with you -- if I married into a $500 gift family, I'd be tempted to skip Christmas entirely. It's just too much. I'd be embarrassed if anyone got me anything that expensive, and I have no idea how to shop at that level.", "YTA\n\nNot in malicious way.

Based on the information presented, it does sound like both OP'S parents and boyfriends parents go above and beyond with Christmas gifts. We need to give OP credit, this is not her first Christmas with her bf's family, and so I think its reasonable to assume that she understands what his family is looking for in Christmas. If she spent $500 on her parents and her bf only spent $100 on his, that shouldn't be her problem, right? But I think we all know this kind of thing usually falls back on the woman in the relationship.

It is so one sided and shows that he doesn't love you. \n\n The fact that he doesn't want to spend money on his parents gifts while asking them for a big expensive one for himself shows the lengths of his greediness and lack of love for everyone in his life.

Not everyone values gift giving in the same way and I think you\u2019re projecting your own feelings onto him by having very particular expectations on who he will buy for.  \n\nNow, I also have a side of me that says NTA. This stuff takes time to learn about a partner, conversation, maturity, communication and all that. It seems like talking about this well BEFORE the holidays didn\u2019t happen.

In my former marriage, close adults all got one approximate budget and so did the kids (but a bigger budget then the adults) unless a loved one was having a rough time financially and then we\u2019d (aka me, I also fell into the trap of doing all the gifting) would add a gift card to target/Walmart/grocery or gas stations on top of a gift. \n\nThird: A grown man that got a week vacation and a four wheeler (that he ASKED FOR) for Christmas and has a (combined) income of 150k who buys his parents a sweater and a bottle of whiskey in return seems, well, a bit selfish. \n\nI mean \u2018the point of the holiday isn\u2019t gifts\u2019 - but it has become that in many families who struggle to express love in words or acts of service, and it\u2019s an extraordinary retail phenomenon once a year in the US than belies that like it or not, it\u2019s a very materialistic holiday in many households. Our conceptual ideal of the holiday vs what it is in actuality I think do lead to harsher critique here of your desire to be equitable than is warranted. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think spending 250 on your mom or dad is bad if you can afford it. I feel like you\u2019re getting unfair pushback on that. Heck I\u2019ve met couples who spent 1k on each the first year of dating. It\u2019s not out of the ordinary. \n\nBut to the point - your FH went back on what he discussed with you, he asked for and received extravagant gifts from his parents and now two years in a row has given much much less in return. We aren\u2019t talking he missed the mark by 50$ but rather 4 digits on reciprocity. I wouldn\u2019t expect 4digits back from my child but a thoughtful and quality gift would be hoped for. Id not vetch at him if he didn\u2019t, but I would likely feel hurt (unless he was having a rough time of course.) A sweater and a bottle of liquor reek of little thought. Id rather a promise to come help me around the house once a month or something loving like that, it needn\u2019t be money. \n\nDoes he show them love and gratitude in other ways (spending a weekend helping them with their yard work or plumbing? Driving them to doctors appointments or taking them to lunch or shows they enjoy, calls them often just to chat etc??) If so than maybe all that needs to be done is having a discussion with all the adults you exchange with - after a direct discussion with him - on budgets and expectations. If he doesn\u2019t show love and appreciation to his folks in other ways I\u2019d say this is a red flag on your FH\u2019s sense of equity and fairness.", "I am reading this, and I feel like your spending doesn't match your financial reality, only what you think it should be based on what you grew up recognizing as a lot of money, as though the economy hasn't ***drastically*** altered since you were roughly in high school...\n\nBut setting aside potentially being bad with money, you have no right to demand that other people do for Christmas what you and your family do. Every family is different, and you don't get to dictate the terms of how someone is with their own family for them.\n\nAlso, the edit doesn't help.

Around my house the best gift that my family likes is that I cook and when I do, I put alot into it, where it is a meal that not only do they enjoy but one where they can think about such for the rest of the year and want to come back to have Christmas dinner again.

I don't like scented products, I'm picky about the tea I like to drink, I have big feet so women's socks are too small to fit... etc.\n\nSo husband and I sat down and talked about it, and decided not to exchange gifts between adults.

This is... crazy", "And where does all his money go?", "You literally made a reddit post making it out like he is some selfish AH for not spending enough on parent Christmas presents.", "I only take umbrage with the idea that men started this pressure. A man possibly but the idea that guys as a whole are the ones who are keeping this going seems a little far fetched.the amount of effort and consistent attention seems like too high a price for men as a whole.  I\u2019m sure people have done all kinds of studies on it. It\u2019s a stigma that makes no sense. There\u2019s no win. It\u2019s a zero sum game and I honestly feel wholeheartedly bad for people that feel this way. It\u2019s a feeling of inadequacy that could reverberate  all year. Gotta stop all that", "Maybe you misunderstood me here. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a patriarchy as pertains to this post or this holiday. It\u2019s not blissful ignorance but any means. We don\u2019t make gifts the focus of Christmas. Or any holiday. Neither one of us make a point to put pressure on eatchother for anything. You should try it because I promise you this made up emotion your feeling if you let go of it, the world keeps on spinning. I\u2019m very sorry u have such negative feelings toward a holiday, and furthermore your so concerned about the patriarchy it\u2019s bleeding into a time you should just be enjoying time with people u care about", "We\u2019re not talking about those. We are talking about a pressure to be the gift goddess. That\u2019s a self appointed pressure and you are a crazy person. No more attention. Goodbye", "Honestly even if it is true I would say OP is the one at fault for being so dumb.", "Omgggg no. No housework. I work from home, so he thinks my breaks are dedicated to that. He does garbage though! I\u2019ll give him that."]}
