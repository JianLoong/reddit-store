It would be seen as gauche and wasteful. My husband's family hand-makes all their gifts (most of them are artists or craftspeople) and it would be weird to buy anything. This was a culture shock for me when we spent our first Christmas with them, as I can't make shit.\n\nYou and your \"FH\" need to talk this out. What does his family expect? Is that expectation reasonable? When you get married, are expectations going to change?\n\nI'll be honest with you -- if I married into a $500 gift family, I'd be tempted to skip Christmas entirely.

We need to give OP credit, this is not her first Christmas with her bf's family, and so I think its reasonable to assume that she understands what his family is looking for in Christmas. If she spent $500 on her parents and her bf only spent $100 on his, that shouldn't be her problem, right?

In my former marriage, close adults all got one approximate budget and so did the kids (but a bigger budget then the adults) unless a loved one was having a rough time financially and then we\u2019d (aka me, I also fell into the trap of doing all the gifting) would add a gift card to target/Walmart/grocery or gas stations on top of a gift. \n\nThird: A grown man that got a week vacation and a four wheeler (that he ASKED FOR) for Christmas and has a (combined) income of 150k who buys his parents a sweater and a bottle of whiskey in return seems, well, a bit selfish. \n\nI mean \u2018the point of the holiday isn\u2019t gifts\u2019 - but it has become that in many families who struggle to express love in words or acts of service, and it\u2019s an extraordinary retail phenomenon once a year in the US than belies that like it or not, it\u2019s a very materialistic holiday in many households. Our conceptual ideal of the holiday vs what it is in actuality I think do lead to harsher critique here of your desire to be equitable than is warranted. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think spending 250 on your mom or dad is bad if you can afford it. I feel like you\u2019re getting unfair pushback on that. Heck I\u2019ve met couples who spent 1k on each the first year of dating. It\u2019s not out of the ordinary. \n\nBut to the point - your FH went back on what he discussed with you, he asked for and received extravagant gifts from his parents and now two years in a row has given much much less in return. We aren\u2019t talking he missed the mark by 50$ but rather 4 digits on reciprocity. I wouldn\u2019t expect 4digits back from my child but a thoughtful and quality gift would be hoped for. Id not vetch at him if he didn\u2019t, but I would likely feel hurt (unless he was having a rough time of course.) A sweater and a bottle of liquor reek of little thought. Id rather a promise to come help me around the house once a month or something loving like that, it needn\u2019t be money. \n\nDoes he show them love and gratitude in other ways (spending a weekend helping them with their yard work or plumbing? Driving them to doctors appointments or taking them to lunch or shows they enjoy, calls them often just to chat etc??) If so than maybe all that needs to be done is having a discussion with all the adults you exchange with - after a direct discussion with him - on budgets and expectations. If he doesn\u2019t show love and appreciation to his folks in other ways I\u2019d say this is a red flag on your FH\u2019s sense of equity and fairness.", "I am reading this and I feel like your spending doesn't match your financial reality, only what you think it should be based on what you grew up recognizing as a lot of money, as though the economy hasn't ***drastically*** altered since you were roughly in high school...\n\nBut setting aside potentially being bad with money, you have no right to demand that other people do for Christmas what you and your family do. Every family is different, and you don't get to dictate the terms of how someone is with their own family for them. \n\nAlso, the edit doesn't help. My dad goes over the top for us for Christmas but not only doesn't expect us to do the same doesn't want us to.

He seems pretty cheap on this, to me.", "Yeah hubby\u2019s innocent, we like his rational spending habits in this house.", "First I saw someone use FH.", "This seems purposely obtuse.", "The post was not about women\u2019s pressure during the holiday it was a lady being upset she shows love with material things and this guys doing his best to keep his dad buzzed and his moms feet warm", "The patriarchy? It\u2019s a holiday. Not a day to demonstrate. What patriarchy? I have a mom and a dad. I have a significant other. We don\u2019t have these issues. I get a card for my birthday and for Christmas. My girl writes me a letter and some other things I\u2019m not mentioning here. My dogs get bigger gifts then I do. It\u2019s not about buying gifts. If it was I wouldn\u2019t be with her. Again if you having that much trouble buying gifts there\u2019s a bigger problem", "I\u2019d like to say that\u2019s easy, but when I cover all expenses in our household, and then expect him to buy a few gifts when we\u2019ve capped our own at 50$ each, it\u2019s hard. I\u2019m now paying for his truck and house too.. so I guess he does have debt- it\u2019s just me paying now.", "I think both. Basic items since they don\u2019t buy themselves anything. It goes from basic clothing, to I bought them a local comedy tickets to have a date night ( haven\u2019t had one in years) they say things that they need all year long and I make lists for the whole year. I do it with my fianc\u00e9 too.", "Maybe they're Prada trash cans?", "Wait. I've gotten lost. You say OP, but you also say fianc\u00e9e. OP is female, her partner is male. If her parents are well off they don't want much in return and then if they aren't well off they're appreciative. But then you say on the other hand if her parents are well off and giving ski vacations they don't care what they get in return. Isn't that the same thing?", "Nope, this is about a woman who\u2019s upset that she thinks she needs to pick up the slack for her boyfriend.", "Sorry I forgot the institution of men being in power for millennia takes a day off on the 25th December", "Why are you paying his debt? He's a grown adult with a job. He can pay his own bills. You aren't going to get out of debt faster paying his bills", "You said in another comment that he makes money too, but you don't know where it's going... \n\nFor your own sake I hope you don't marry this man before you get that figured out, that is not a good foundation for a partnership. \n\nThis completely changes your post and idk why you didn't lead with this information, unless it's simply untrue. But if it IS true you have FAR bigger issues than who buys what for Christmas.", "Why are you doing this? \n\nHe makes more money but pays for nothing? How does this make sense to you?", "Stop paying for his stuff. What the heck?\n\nYou both seem to make poor financial decisions. I strongly suggest you get some counseling and talk to a financial advisor before you get married. You both need to buy in on a budget or your marriage is going to be a financial disaster.", "You conveniently left all of these pertinent details out until you started getting called an asshole. Not calling you a liar, but if the shoe fits...", "Why are you paying for everything if he makes more than you?", "If this is the case, you need to take a hard look at how the two of you look at finances.  If he makes more money, and has no debt, it doesn\u2019t seem to make sense that you are paying all the bills.    \n\n\nDiffering styles of gift giving are a symptom of financial philosophy\u2014if your views on spending money are so different that is a big red flag for your marriage.", "He earns more than you and you're paying back debt, plus you are paying for all the household expenses and for his truck?! Where does his money go and why isn't he paying for anything? \n\nIt sounds like Christmas isn't the real issue here, it's your whole financial situation.", "Stop paying for him\n\nObviously.\n\nHe's an adult who makes more than you, whilst you have debt. Why are you paying for him?", "I think you sound like a very thoughtful person, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to give your family, and extended family, nice gifts at Christmas. In my family, Christmas and birthdays have pretty much been the only times we get \u201cwants\u201d, and not \u201cneeds\u201d, although there\u2019s often crossover between wants/needs.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound materialistic - your FH sounds cheap and weird with money. Stop paying for his stuff so that you can spend your money as you wish. Also, having debt doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have disposable income. If that was true, no one with a mortgage, car payment, or student loans would ever be able to \u201cafford\u201d the holidays. When my husband and I were first married, he was shocked that I spent $100 per family member at Christmas. I could afford it, and so could he. He just balked because honestly - he\u2019s not a generous person. He\u2019s gotten better, thank goodness, but the first few years were difficult.", "Like I said your projecting a political point onto a Christmas question. Not the place", "Well it doesn\u2019t, but I love him, and he asks so I do. It\u2019s automatic for me. I have no clue where his money goes to, but he always seems to ask if I can cover things.", "I didn\u2019t think I needed to shame him personally. Didn\u2019t think it would be required. In the end I\u2019m marrying this person, so what I cover of his for basic living doesn\u2019t relate to this in my mind. I was asking about Christmas and gifts. Not trying to dive into what I pay for. Everyone seems to be pretty concerned with that part rather than my question of- should I be embarrassed or is that normal.", "\"I have no clue where his money goes to, but he always seems to ask if I can cover things.\"\n\nThat is a HUGE red flag and something you're gonna want to sort out before you get married.", "He's using you. You're very unhappy with him around this.  Don't seem like compatible views.", "You have way bigger issues in your relationship than Christmas presents. How do you expect to build a life this way?", "He makes more than you, but you're paying for his home and his truck???  \n\nI think you really need to spend some time thinking about this.  This guy sounds like he uses people for money.  He uses his parents, and he's using you.   This is going to be your life if you marry him.    At least get a good prenup if you do decide to marry him.", "Well, that\u2019s not a logical argument for why you are paying all expenses.    His money is going somewhere or to someone", "It sounds like you give him a lot of deference when it comes to finances, why wouldn't you defer to his judgment about gifts for his family?", "Your marriage is not going to survive even if you keep your head in the sand.", "And lots of people love their abusers, but that doesn't make it right. I loved mine up until I moved out and got a lot of therapy to deal with it. I'm not saying your fianc\u00e9 is abusive, but I am absolutely saying there is something hugely wrong in your relationship and you need to figure that out NOW.", "Sweetie. This is not okay. Why are you marrying this person? He is taking only and giving nothing.", "I love my husband, but if he asked me for this, his bags would be packed. At the very least, we'd be talking to a financial advisor.\n\nAnd personally, I'm on his side, Christmas-wise. A super nice pair of slippers and some whiskey is a respectable gift for one's parents. But the rest of it is Red Flag City.", "Uh, wtf. Maybe gift him a doormat so he stops using you as one? You should really be questioning things. The gifts for his parents are not the issue here at all.", "Why are you getting married without knowing this information", "People are concerned because him living off of you (with a higher salary and no student debt) is a *much* more significant issue than Christmas presents. So you\u2019re either making stuff up to save face, or you have a wildly skewed view of what\u2019s important in a relationship.", "The concern is because it\u2019s odd that you\u2019re paying for everything when he makes more. Most couples split things according to income, and some split 50/50. It\u2019s strange that you, with the lower income, are paying for things like a mortgage and a vehicle that, unless your name is on the papers, are *legally his, not yours*. \n\n\nIf you have your reasons, fine. But don\u2019t come on here and ask if you\u2019re an asshole for expecting him to purchase gifts for his own family, then frame yourself like you\u2019re a materialistic, overspending woman. Because that\u2019s how the post sounds, like you\u2019re extremely hung up on money and gifts. \n\n\nIn reality, you gift nice things that you could reasonably afford, if it weren\u2019t for him sticking you with all his bills. And you\u2019re rightfully upset, regardless of spending limits, because the financial load is all on you. \n\nIf you have specific reasons to be covering the majority of the expenses right now, such as him being a full time caretaker for family or if he\u2019s going to school, feeling annoyed or angry about the responsibility from time to time is fine as well. But you\u2019d be the asshole if you made him feel bad if y\u2019all have a set agreement and you\u2019ve never really discussed trying to end that agreement, or if you\u2019ve never expressed any feelings about it.", "What is normal for my family is not necessarily normal for yours. If you are ok with how you gift to your parents, let him be comfortable with how he gifts his.  And for alot of people your finances/budget matters as to how you approach gift giving every year.", "Nobody on this specific thread said a single thing about what YOU pay for expense-wise, so don't say you don't want to shame him. You brought it up to pivot. Be for real right now."]}
