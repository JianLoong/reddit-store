I exceeded in my studies and I take pride in this. However I don't feel like I got the proper attention growing up.\nMy brother (14) was diagnosed with autism 3 years ago, at this point I was still living with my family and living normally. Once he got diagnosed my family changed, my parents acted like he was a precious baby who needed care 24/7 and he ate it up. They would feed him anything, buy him any gifts, take him to fancy places and just waste my money. And I was forgotten pretty much. \n\nI lived acing exams and getting nothing whilst if he did the slightest thing he got rewarded. He rubbed this in my face constantly. The money I made from my job went towards him because he was different. But he is not different to how he was before getting the diagnosis. He is so arrogant and LOVES to brag about anything, he calls me awful things. He tried burning my clothes once and blamed it on his autism, my parents being clueless believed him He begged me to leave the house and asked my parents for money all the time, which in turn makes them ask me. My silly 16 year old self gave in and gave more, I would end up not eating a few meals a week just to pay for his stupid wants. \n\nI left to go to University at 17, I study law in one of the best in my country on scholarship. I still work one of my jobs to pay for my living expenses but apart from that, I save up. I went no contact with my brother but my parents texted me asking for around \u00a3800-\u00a3960 MONTHLY. A bit too much. I went no contact 2 months ago and I've saved up alot for myself and I'm very proud.\n\nYesterday I got a message from an unknown number. I figured it was my brother since he was, you guessed it, asking for money. He said mum lost her job and although I feel for them, I don't feel sympathy. He was spoiled, I was forgotten. MY money went to him instead of food and they chose to do that. They need to learn that he is asking too much and they need priorities. \n\nI know it wasnt much but I didnt feel the responsibility was on me to do this.\n\nThe best part? I was diagnosed with Aspergers 3 weeks ago. Went through speech therapy, neurologists, brain scans and more things but it made it so much better. Aspergers is high-functioning autism, more than my brothers. Yet I was treated differently.\n\nAITA?
