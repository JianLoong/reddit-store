I exceeded in my studies and I take pride in this. However I don't feel like I got the proper attention growing up.\nMy brother (14) was diagnosed with autism 3 years ago, at this point I was still living with my family and living normally. Once he got diagnosed my family changed, my parents acted like he was a precious baby who needed care 24/7 and he ate it up. They would feed him anything, buy him any gifts, take him to fancy places and just waste my money. And I was forgotten pretty much. \n\nI lived acing exams and getting nothing whilst if he did the slightest thing he got rewarded. He rubbed this in my face constantly. The money I made from my job went towards him because he was different. But he is not different to how he was before getting the diagnosis. He is so arrogant and LOVES to brag about anything, he calls me awful things. He tried burning my clothes once and blamed it on his autism, my parents being clueless believed him He begged me to leave the house and asked my parents for money all the time, which in turn makes them ask me. My silly 16 year old self gave in and gave more, I would end up not eating a few meals a week just to pay for his stupid wants. \n\nI left to go to University at 17, I study law in one of the best in my country on scholarship. I still work one of my jobs to pay for my living expenses but apart from that, I save up. I went no contact with my brother but my parents texted me asking for around \u00a3800-\u00a3960 MONTHLY. A bit too much. I went no contact 2 months ago and I've saved up alot for myself and I'm very proud.\n\nYesterday I got a message from an unknown number. I figured it was my brother since he was, you guessed it, asking for money. He said mum lost her job and although I feel for them, I don't feel sympathy. He was spoiled, I was forgotten. MY money went to him instead of food and they chose to do that. They need to learn that he is asking too much and they need priorities. \n\nI know it wasnt much but I didnt feel the responsibility was on me to do this.\n\nThe best part? I was diagnosed with Aspergers 3 weeks ago. Went through speech therapy, neurologists, brain scans and more things but it made it so much better. Aspergers is high-functioning autism, more than my brothers. Yet I was treated differently.\n\nAITA?

(Source: I worked with kids in care in the school system for a time). \n\nAdditionally, I could be wrong, but I thought you had to be at least 18 to attend uni in the UK.\n\nSeems like OP had a shitty time of things but some details don\u2019t add up to me.", "There is an effort to move away from the term because it's named after a Nazi.", "You can go to Uni in Scotland at 17, at least you could when I lived there.\nMy daughter was diagnosed with autism last year and it didn\u2019t involve any brain scans either.

But I do believe diagnostic tests are pretty universal. Maybe there is additional context OP isn\u2019t providing that would make it make sense\u2026.", "I thought Asperger's isn't diagnosed anymore - it was not included in the most recent version of the DSM (DSM-5).", "NTA there was a reason you went no contact. Keep to no contact. You paid your way through life with hard work and sacrifices that you NEVER should have been asked to make.

Let alone a regular monthly payment of hundreds of pounds. \n\nStay NC, switch all your social media accounts to private and change all your contact info that your parents & brother have for you. \n\nIf any of them contact you again asking for your money, make a police report for harassment. Be sure to let the police know that you are NC with no desire to ever have any contact or provide them with any cash.   \n\nGood luck!", "NTA, and please keep every $ you make to better your own life. Mom and dad will take care of your brother. Your family is not your responsibility.", "yeah i was diagnosed with autism ar 18 in 2012 and i never had my brain scanned. I wonder if some doctors do, do it, but i never got my brain scanned.", "NTA. You made the right choice and you should stick to being no contact. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that!\n\nAlso as someone who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s as a child, it is not called that anymore. It\u2019s just referred to as being on the autism spectrum. If you look up the history of how Asperger\u2019s got it\u2019s name, it has origins to the Nazi\u2019s and the holocaust so it is seen as an outdated diagnosis. It is frowned upon socially to refer to having that diagnosis instead of saying you have Autism. I\u2019m not sure what country you\u2019re from which probably has something to do with you receiving that diagnosis but I wanted to let you know that it\u2019s not recognized by that name anymore. \n\nIf you want to do some research about Autism, you\u2019ll find they also don\u2019t refer to people being high functioning anymore because it implies that there are low functioning people with autism. While there are people who face different challenges from their autism that might make things harder than others, they are not lesser (or lower) because of that. It\u2019s why it is now a spectrum instead of a scale.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of any of this for a long time and would have appreciated someone sharing it with me which is why I am sharing it with you. Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t completely capable of doing whatever you want to. There\u2019s plenty of wonderful online communities that are educating people about autism which is where I learned all of this information. I found a lot of it on tiktok and Instagram but I know there are other ways to learn about it to. I wish you the best!!", "NTA\n\nSend them a copy of your diagnostic paperwork.\n\n\"I'm autistic too. I spent years working my ass off to put food on the table while you spoiled the golden boy for being autistic. I'm not giving you more of my hard earned money.

Maybe it\u2019s different in the UK, but here in Australia people simply get diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, even those who would\u2019ve once been diagnosed as having Asperger\u2019s.", "Yeah same it made me wonder too. Also do you get brain scans, see a neurologist and stuff for an autism diagnosis? I didn\u2019t and most of my friends are autistic and none of them did (In UK too).  And they only got diagnosed three weeks ago but already the speech therapy and neurologist stuff has made it \u2018so much better\u2019. It\u2019s really confusing.\n\nNot just this but there are other parts of the story that just seem off and bad fiction like. Like I assume they\u2019re in the UK based on \u00a3 usage but I\u2019m 99% sure you legally cannot work at age 13, and not only that but two jobs? There\u2019s a lot that doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Even if they can't pay for food that's their own damn fault for burning that bridge.\n\nYou can't steal from someone for years, rub their face in it, and expect them to fucking give you anything.\n\n\nThey're adults. It's time they stop abusing their children (forcing a thirteen year old to work multiple jobs to support the family is abuse. Spoiling a child rotten is abuse- especially when one child goes without so that can happen) and act like grown ups.\n\nThey can go to food banks and pantries. They can work odd jobs. They can juggle multiple jobs- OP did it while in school and a child. \n\nThey're adults, it's time they learned how to manage their problems", "It could be the way it was explained.  Like they told her, \"you have a form of autism, we used to call it aspergers, you probably heard of that, well thats what you have.\"\n\nThat said, so many of these posts now are hard to believe so you could be right lol", "It's the same in the UK but there are people who prefer to use the term Asperger's as opposed to Autistic, even if it's no longer officially recognised/separated.\n\nIt just fits better for some (myself included), because I know where I sit on the spectrum.", "Could be a doctor saying 'Your autistic. We used to call the type of autism you have Asperger's, so you'll find a lot of helpful resources and information under that particular search term' or similar", "I've been diagnosed in Australia with autism - and few people even want to use the term Aspergers these days given it was named after a nazi who recommended the children he diagnosed with it be euthanised. It's an outdated term usually held onto by those who were officially diagnosed with it years ago.\n\nAutism can't be diagnosed with brain scans, or by a neurologist. In my country only a psychatrist can, although a psychologist can informally diagnose, or confirm.\n\nAutism is not detectable by any kind of brain scan or dna test (it IS genetic, but not detectable yet). And you would definitely see a psych before you would a neurologist, particularly if there was family history of autism. \n\nSpeech therapy is generally not necessary for adults, it's more to assist development for people that need it. There isn't any medication that's recommended to help, although it's possible to be prescribed something to help mood swings or meltdowns. If OP has been independant for some time, and is considered \"high functioning\" - another outdated term. Autism is a spectrum NOT a scale, but it is still commonly used - then they wouldn't even be eligible for assistance, except through private providers.", "Yep, never ever heard of the whole brain scan issue and they got that, neurologist work and speech therapy already after only getting diagnosed three weeks ago? And yeah the 13 year old job thing it\u2019s possible but extremely unlikely. All these things put together make me believe it\u2019s fake.", "Yeah there\u2019s so much else in this post that just seems really fake, like brain scans for \u2018Asperger\u2019s\u2019 which is extremely rare and only happens when there\u2019s other problems. And they\u2019ve already had all these treatments since getting diagnosed three weeks ago? The waitlists for these treatments can be years long. \n\nAnd they worked two jobs from 13? This is illegal and practically impossible in the UK unless something extremely dodgy was going on and OP didn\u2019t go to school (which is again impossible based on how intelligent and successful they claim to be). It seems like bad fiction written by a 15 year old tbh.", "NTA. That was child abuse. \n\nHowever, Asperger\u2019s is a disused term. I\u2019m surprised your medical team uses it.", "NTA it's not your job to support your parent's family, it's you parents responsibility.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m not surprised to learn you are also autistic, there is a large genetic component and it\u2019s not common for siblings (especially female/ afab ones) to be overlooked because they have different traits. Your parents are also failing your brother here.\n\nI will say I\u2019m surprised anyone is still diagnosing Aspergers in the year 2023. As far as I\u2019m aware, it has been removed from pretty much all diagnostic manuals around the world. The diagnosis was named for a literal N*zi, and existence of this diagnosis as one separate from autism is rooted in ableism and eugenics.", "NTA...
