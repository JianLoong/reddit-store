He tried burning my clothes once and blamed it on his autism, my parents being clueless believed him He begged me to leave the house and asked my parents for money all the time, which in turn makes them ask me.

I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that!\n\nAlso as someone who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s as a child, it is not called that anymore. It\u2019s just referred to as being on the autism spectrum. If you look up the history of how Asperger\u2019s got it\u2019s name, it has origins to the Nazi\u2019s and the holocaust so it is seen as an outdated diagnosis. It is frowned upon socially to refer to having that diagnosis instead of saying you have Autism. I\u2019m not sure what country you\u2019re from which probably has something to do with you receiving that diagnosis but I wanted to let you know that it\u2019s not recognized by that name anymore. \n\nIf you want to do some research about Autism, you\u2019ll find they also don\u2019t refer to people being high functioning anymore because it implies that there are low functioning people with autism. While there are people who face different challenges from their autism that might make things harder than others, they are not lesser (or lower) because of that. It\u2019s why it is now a spectrum instead of a scale.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of any of this for a long time and would have appreciated someone sharing it with me which is why I am sharing it with you. Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t completely capable of doing whatever you want to.

Also do you get brain scans, see a neurologist and stuff for an autism diagnosis? I didn\u2019t and most of my friends are autistic and none of them did (In UK too).  And they only got diagnosed three weeks ago but already the speech therapy and neurologist stuff has made it \u2018so much better\u2019. It\u2019s really confusing.\n\nNot just this but there are other parts of the story that just seem off and bad fiction like.

Spoiling a child rotten is abuse- especially when one child goes without so that can happen) and act like grown ups.\n\nThey can go to food banks and pantries. They can work odd jobs. They can juggle multiple jobs- OP did it while in school and a child. \n\nThey're adults, it's time they learned how to manage their problems", "It could be the way it was explained.

We used to call the type of autism you have Asperger's, so you'll find a lot of helpful resources and information under that particular search term' or similar", "I've been diagnosed in Australia with autism - and few people even want to use the term Aspergers these days given it was named after a nazi who recommended the children he diagnosed with it be euthanised. It's an outdated term usually held onto by those who were officially diagnosed with it years ago.\n\nAutism can't be diagnosed with brain scans, or by a neurologist. In my country only a psychatrist can, although a psychologist can informally diagnose, or confirm.\n\nAutism is not detectable by any kind of brain scan or dna test (it IS genetic, but not detectable yet). And you would definitely see a psych before you would a neurologist, particularly if there was family history of autism. \n\nSpeech therapy is generally not necessary for adults, it's more to assist development for people that need it. There isn't any medication that's recommended to help, although it's possible to be prescribed something to help mood swings or meltdowns. If OP has been independant for some time, and is considered \"high functioning\" - another outdated term. Autism is a spectrum NOT a scale, but it is still commonly used - then they wouldn't even be eligible for assistance, except through private providers.", "Yep, never ever heard of the whole brain scan issue and they got that, neurologist work and speech therapy already after only getting diagnosed three weeks ago?

And they\u2019ve already had all these treatments since getting diagnosed three weeks ago? The waitlists for these treatments can be years long. \n\nAnd they worked two jobs from 13?

However, it was on a regional basis so some would take longer than others.", "There are many plot holes in this story.", "You can go to college/uni at 16 in the UK although it's pretty rare. 17/18 is more common.

Uni acceptance is normally based on 5th year exams and if you're young in your year, you might still be 16 when you get them and get into uni. Certain courses like medicine want the 6th year exam results. \n\nUK also uses ICD-10 rather than DSM V and it still has Asperger's as a diagnosis. ICD11 doesn't but looks like it doesn't come into play in England until 2026. \n\nNone of what OP has written is impossible.

It\u2019s so rare that it\u2019s barely worth even discussing. OOP did not leave home and start university at the age of 17. \n\nCollege is not the same as university. College, further education, is age 16-18. University, higher education, is 18. It would be very unusual to have a student below that age start a degree.\n\nI promise you, Asperger\u2019s is no longer diagnosed in the UK.

Why would I discuss the educational system in Botswana or Croatia when the OOP is clearly the subject of the conversation and in the fucking uk?\n\nI have referred to the education system in the UK. Where the OOP is from. It really is just that simple."]}
