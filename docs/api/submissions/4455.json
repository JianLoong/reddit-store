Both hurt like hell, but the loss of a person hurts that much more.\n\nEspecially when it was so sudden.\n\nThe way her pet died, I wouldn't be surprised if that shook you up too. If anything she's the one being insensitive.", "NTA\nDid your \"friend\" do any of those things for you when you lost your dad? If not, she's an emotional vampire.\nI'm very sorry for your loss. I lost my BFF to cancer last year and I'm still not over it, but she would never want me to shut myself in.", "NTA\n\nYou might want to re-evaluate that \"friendship\".\nSo sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nshe's the AH. Cut her loose.", "NTA  Your \"friend\" is unrealistically demanding. Has she been there for you since your father's death? Sounds like she hasn't. No friend has the right to say what her friends can and cannot do. Being on call daily is also not a requirement. I'm dumbfounded.\n\nI'm so sorry for your tragic loss.", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve been there for her, and she hasn\u2019t been there for you. It\u2019s a one-sided relationship. She shouldn\u2019t be creating drama in a time of loss, she lacks awareness and compassion.", "Well, one is a person that is blood related and has been with you for your lifetime up until this point while the other is a pet of someone who you have known for a period that is not as long as you've known the former. It's painful to bear the loss of someone else's pet but it is far less painful than bearing the loss of a person who is very important in bringing you to life.\n\nAs far as this goes, you're NTA because grieving for your loss of your father first instead of your friend's pet is definitely natural. My condolences to you and I know that it is hard to fill up that void in your heart.\n\n(Also, your friend's kind of self-centered since she thinks that her pet must come first before your loved one)\n\n(PS: you're not exaggerating when you say that your father was your world to you, most of us are like that)", "NTA sorry for your loss. Can\u2019t imagine how tough this is for you. Also she\u2019s not a real friend, dump her ass.", "NTA - you had to go through two deaths, even if the dog wasn't yours, you still had to experience someone else's grief on top of your own. She doesn't really sound like a friend", "NTA Your friend isn\u2019t acting like a friend with you.\n\nI once had a close friend that suddenly evolved into us snipping at each other over the period of a year\u2026Until I reached out and asked what had happened; turned out neither of us knew what happened, we just both kept thinking the other hated us and kept on lashing out at the other.\n\nThe point of this being, she could\u2019ve reached out to you to ask what was happening, or about her feelings of betrayal, or anything. Everyone grieves in their own ways, perhaps her being on the phone was her way of dealing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb I don\u2019t know. However, friends give each other the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYou are still grieving your dad. The cancer diagnosis of this dog is a heavy reminder of that and you did a wonderful thing by being there for her through that process. Give yourself some grace, give her a little grace. Maybe a month from now she\u2019ll reach out about all this and apologize. Maybe not.\n\nKeep moving through and processing your own grief. If she comes back, I\u2019d attribute her actions to the grief of her dog being lost and try again. But if she doesn\u2019t, keep being the wonderful person, the wonderful friend, you are.", "NTA. I am so very sorry for your loss. Given how compassionate and selfless you are, I assume your dad was an amazing man to raise someone like you and he would be so proud of you.\n\nYour friend is utterly selfish. Firstly, she knew you'd recently lost one of the most important PEOPLE in your life yet she thought it was acceptable to emotionally dump on you as opposed to any other friend/relative out there- you don't do that to someone... you especially don't equate the loss of a PERSON to the loss of an ANIMAL... There is no comparison whatsoever, yet you treated her with compassion as though it was comparable. At that point I would've been rolling my eyes if I were in your shoes.\n\nShe is no friend whatsoever. Let her mourn the loss of a good and true friendship, and move on with your life with people who do truly value your friendship.", "NTA.  \n\nFirst off sorry for your loss OP.  \n\nI agree with others in saying this sounds like a one way friendship. Both of you are grieving and having people try and alleviate some of your grief shouldn't be seen as downplaying or ignoring hers. You have to take care of yourself and should never feel guilty about it.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need a selfish bitch like that in your life. At all.\n\nUnfollow her on social.", "NTA- I love my dogs, and I grieve hard for my dogs when I lose them. But this person, this is not a friend.", "NAH, you both are grieving. You both need time to come around reality that you will never see your loved ones again. Maybe you can try to reach to your friend and tell them you are still grieving too and you need to process your emotions as they do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I am sorry that your \"friend\" is acting in such a selfish and uncaring manner.        \n  \nBe kind to yourself. Don't obsess over your friend and her dog. Hopefully she will come around eventually (she has grief [not comparing a dog to a father] and it will lessen and hopefully she will see her treatment of you during your time of loss and grief was horrible!)", "NTA. I lost my father suddenly, after being incredibly close to him my entire life. There's a few people that because of their behavior while I was grieving, I've let go of. So sorry for your loss, OP.", "NTA. Block her now and forever. You have enough on your plate.\n\nI'm so sorry about your dad.", "NTA and I'm so very sorry for your loss. The loss of a parent that was your everything is a kind of pain I would not wish on my worst enemy. FUCK cancer.", "This is your friend ? You need to choose better. She sounds like a cartoon of someone detached from reality", "NTA your so called friend is bang out of order...you've just lost your father...wheres her compassion...drop her...she can leach of someone else", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. It sounds like you have been a very good friend to her. She however is not a friend to you. Let her go, she will drain you emotionally.", "You're NTA. It sounds like she's taking her grief out on you.

These people like to be the centre of attention. They can not see you are grieving over your dad (one of the most important persons of your life). I have friends who still mourn the loss of their parent 15 years later (and that is fine ofcourse only telling it to show how short 2 months is). I am so sorry for your loss. Maybe you should put this friendship away for a little bit because it is something you should not have to go through at this point in your grieve. She really is an inconsidirate friend.", "She came for the funeral, and texted me a couple of times after. I couldn't talk to anybody during the month because it was all so sudden. When her dog was getting surgery, she was giggling on the phone talking to some guy. So much so the vet thought her dog was mine.", "Yes, I've told her I'm not mentally okay to check in on her. She says you're not the only one going through loss.\n\nI think it's best i let go", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is not a good person.", "This makes it pretty obvious this person is unreasonable and apparently exaggerating her discomposure at the loss of her pet. I wouldn't consider her a friend. She should have been there for you more, not vice versa.", "I've lost a pet and I've lost a parent. Those losses, I'm sorry to say, are not on the same level. She will probably replace her pet within the year, wheras you'll never have another dad. \nGet rid of this person for your own sake."]}
