If anything she's the one being insensitive.", "NTA\nDid your \"friend\" do any of those things for you when you lost your dad? If not, she's an emotional vampire.\nI'm very sorry for your loss.

Cut her loose.", "NTA  Your \"friend\" is unrealistically demanding. Has she been there for you since your father's death? Sounds like she hasn't. No friend has the right to say what her friends can and cannot do. Being on call daily is also not a requirement. I'm dumbfounded.\n\nI'm so sorry for your tragic loss.", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve been there for her, and she hasn\u2019t been there for you. It\u2019s a one-sided relationship. She shouldn\u2019t be creating drama in a time of loss, she lacks awareness and compassion.", "Well, one is a person that is blood related and has been with you for your lifetime up until this point while the other is a pet of someone who you have known for a period that is not as long as you've known the former. It's painful to bear the loss of someone else's pet but it is far less painful than bearing the loss of a person who is very important in bringing you to life.\n\nAs far as this goes, you're NTA because grieving for your loss of your father first instead of your friend's pet is definitely natural. My condolences to you and I know that it is hard to fill up that void in your heart.\n\n(Also, your friend's kind of self-centered since she thinks that her pet must come first before your loved one)\n\n(PS: you're not exaggerating when you say that your father was your world to you, most of us are like that)", "NTA sorry for your loss.

She doesn't really sound like a friend", "NTA Your friend isn\u2019t acting like a friend with you.\n\nI once had a close friend that suddenly evolved into us snipping at each other over the period of a year\u2026Until I reached out and asked what had happened; turned out neither of us knew what happened, we just both kept thinking the other hated us and kept on lashing out at the other.\n\nThe point of this being, she could\u2019ve reached out to you to ask what was happening, or about her feelings of betrayal, or anything. Everyone grieves in their own ways, perhaps her being on the phone was her way of dealing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb I don\u2019t know. However, friends give each other the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYou are still grieving your dad. The cancer diagnosis of this dog is a heavy reminder of that and you did a wonderful thing by being there for her through that process. Give yourself some grace, give her a little grace. Maybe a month from now she\u2019ll reach out about all this and apologize. Maybe not.\n\nKeep moving through and processing your own grief. If she comes back, I\u2019d attribute her actions to the grief of her dog being lost and try again. But if she doesn\u2019t, keep being the wonderful person, the wonderful friend, you are.", "NTA. I am so very sorry for your loss. Given how compassionate and selfless you are, I assume your dad was an amazing man to raise someone like you and he would be so proud of you.\n\nYour friend is utterly selfish. Firstly, she knew you'd recently lost one of the most important PEOPLE in your life yet she thought it was acceptable to emotionally dump on you as opposed to any other friend/relative out there- you don't do that to someone... you especially don't equate the loss of a PERSON to the loss of an ANIMAL... There is no comparison whatsoever, yet you treated her with compassion as though it was comparable. At that point I would've been rolling my eyes if I were in your shoes.\n\nShe is no friend whatsoever. Let her mourn the loss of a good and true friendship, and move on with your life with people who do truly value your friendship.", "NTA.  \n\nFirst off sorry for your loss OP.  \n\nI agree with others in saying this sounds like a one way friendship. Both of you are grieving and having people try and alleviate some of your grief shouldn't be seen as downplaying or ignoring hers. You have to take care of yourself and should never feel guilty about it.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need a selfish bitch like that in your life.

You are in a fog. Emotions are everywhere. In this time, I dropped two friends who weren't there for me. I didn't have the energy to connect. Why didn't she get in touch with you since you lost your dad? The phone works both ways. I would drop her. You can connect later if you want to. Right now, focus on yourself. What helped me is finding a bereavement group with no timeline. Mine was connected to three hospice we used.  \n\nIf you feel up to it, you can go. I didn't feel up to going until 6 months. It is okay to feel like you are going crazy.  You are not. It is good to find people who are going through the process of living presence to loving memory. \n\nI am sorry for your loss.

I have a very good friend who lost an aunt the day before my aunt died. Both deaths were expected. Her aunt died or COPD and mine died of cancer. I\u2019ve been meaning to text her to see how she\u2019s doing but we all got Covid and we couldn\u2019t even attend the funeral. She also hasn\u2019t texted me but I get it. She\u2019s grieving. But good friends understand that things happen.", "NTA. But I'd say: \"I'm sorry I can't always be 100% available to support you. I think it's hard for us both right now to be each other's rock when we're both still reeling from grief. Let's both try to give each other some extra compassion and space to grieve. As you know, we can be fine one minute or one day, then absolutely crushed the next. During those times, it's of course hard for each of us to be there for someone else. If you don't immediately hear from me, I hope you'll reach out to others in your support system and find the love and understanding you need in that moment and realize I care about you even if I don't have the ability to be someone you can lean on in that moment.\"\n\nShe probably just saw you out having friends support you and felt jealous and insecure and projected that onto you and imagined your indifference to her. You can probably clear it up if you want to. But if you feel that her unkindness was too selfish to forgive and want to just take some distance from her, that's totally okay too. Her loss was more recent, but nothing cuts so deep as a personal family loss and it isn't something you recover from in a couple months. Her expectations of you are unreasonable and you've already done enough to be a supportive friend. Her tantrum sounds emotionally exhausting and it's okay if you aren't up for dealing with that and trying to soothe hurt feelings you did nothing to stir up.", "OP I\u2019ve fought with people when we\u2019ve both been grieving. You can understand how grief and emotions play a role in someone\u2019s actions without ever needing to forgive them. \n\nYour friend is struggling but that does not excuse her from attacking you. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP.", "I am so sorry for your loss.   You are a good person to support your friend in the midst of your own grief.

I don't necessarily agree for all circumstances but I think you're right often enough, I was just amused.", "No, i couldn't talk to her about it. She didn't have a dad growing up. It felt wrong to burden her with it. Its only been mom and me that have been there for each other.", "NTA\n\nThis \u2018friend\u2019 is ridiculous- and horrible to you. There is no comparison between the loss of a pet and a parent.\n\nDitch her and take care of yourself", "NTA. Let her go... The sudden loss of an immediate family member pales in comparison to the loss of an elderly pet. She doesn't get it and never will. You'll be grieving for a very long time and that's ok. Take care of you first. \nAnd yes there is a hierarchy to levels of pain and loss. Sorry but it's true. I lost a child and if someone wants to compare that grief to losing their dog they can go f*k themselves.", "NTA  She just wants attention.  I get it - losing a pet is hard.  Losing a parent is a whole other level of loss.\n\nLost my Mom, unexpectedly, in April.  Yeah, I don't have near the capacity to deal with drama like that that I used to.\n\nI'm really sorry for your loss, I know how you feel.", "NTA, you have your own loss to deal with which is exhausting enough. You don't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with your grieving friend too. She is being very selfish to expect you to check in with her constantly. Please accept my condolences for the loss of your dad and please don't expend any energy on this selfish person. Block her if you need to and take as much time as you need to in order to grieve the lose of your dad. The holidays are so tough when you've lost someone, especially the first holiday without them. Take care of yourself and don't give this \"friend\" anymore of your time and headspace.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need that kind of drama in your life from her", "NTA - I had a vaguely similar situation happen to me a few years ago, where a friend accused me of not giving her enough attention when I was simply unable to. (Another friend was accused of this, after his wife had just given birth to their child, so he was understandably not prioritising our mutual friend). \n\nYour friend has shown her true colours - she doesn't care as much about you as she cares about herself, and she doesn't deserve to be in your life. But whether you try to stay in touch with her or not, you did absolutely nothing wrong in this instance.", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds like an emotional vampire.\n\nYou have to do you.  If you're Christian, your first Christmas without Dad is two weeks away.  You lost your Dad recently enough that you're probably going to be functioning on autopilot this season, and it might not really hit you until this time next year.\n\nI can't believe you had the bandwidth to deal with her, especially if you're also trying to be there for your Mom as well (you don't mention if she's with you or they were together at the time of his death), or kids who have just lost Grandpa (either your own or nieblings).", "Oh wow,NTA. You actually went above and beyond your duty. Yes,it hurts when you lose a pet,it's awful,but she needs to realize you just lost your father and you are going through a hard time . Her hard time doesn't trump yours. If anything,she is being the asshole for thinking it should all revolve around her and her grief.", "Nta but hun that's not a friend, it's a one upper. Someone who always has to compete, no matter the cost. What it's costing you is the ability to grieve properly. You need to block them from your socials for the time being & when you are ready & able to think clearly, reevaluate the friendship.", "Nta. You lost a parent and she lost a pet. There is a massive difference. Your dad most likely had a hand in teaching you to walk and talk and become a functioning child and adult. And he was your dad. She lost her dog, while that is sad the emotional upheaval is different.", "Nta \n\nI lost my pet 4 days ago suddenly but if a friend of my lost her parent(s) suddenly than I have more compassion for her. \nYes a pet can be family but a human is more than that. Its love and communication you lose.", "NTA\n\n>I was with her through it all, from taking her to the vet, her surgery and euthanasia, all the way to cremating her (the dog)\n\nYou were there for her. She's just being horrible and expecting all the attention.", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. Your father just died, if anyone's being mean, it's your friend. Also the expectation that you are required to \"check in every day\" is absurd, even if you weren't grieving, but the fact that you are makes it more ridiculous.", "Jesus fn christ!!! No your NTA losing a parent and losing a pet are WORLDS apart!!!", "Tell her you never entered the Grief Olympics so she gets the Gold Medal by default. Then never speak to her again.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHuman vs animal?  Draw your own conclusion.  Sure, we grieve for our pet loss but humans' deaths trump over animals' deaths.  He was YOUR DAD, FFS!  You have every right to grieve over your great loss.  Your friend can grieve over her pet's loss but she couldn't expect you to do the same with her because you have your full plate.  She should have checked ON YOU to see if you're all right, not the other way around. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  I'm sorry about your dad.  My dad died in a similar way, when I was a teenager - he only knew he had cancer for a month, we kids only knew for about two weeks.  I always tell people he died suddenly of lung cancer.  It's a fucked up thing to try to reconcile within yourself - usually a cancer diagnosis means a slow progression, and a bit of time to process what's happening.  Anyway, I can relate, and I'm sorry.", "Holy shit NTA.\n\nSo sorry for your loss.  I lost my dad 4 years ago and completely understand the feeling of not knowing who you are anymore.  It's like a huge part of the foundation of your identity has suddenly vanished.\n\nI also understand losing a pet and how devastating that is.  But you can't be the only one responsible for your friend's mental well being.  I'm guessing she is more of a taker than a giver in general.", "NTA. Losing a parent is hard especially if you know it's coming cause the anxiety builds up.\n\nI (29m)have lost both my parents; my mother while in highschool and my father while in college. My mother was unexpected and died after childbirth because of complications while my father has always been in and out of the hospital for sickle cell, past injuries etc.\n\nPops death still hit like truck even though I knew I was going to lose him eventually. I have been where you have been but don't close yourself off and accept whatever help you can get no matter how small", "This logic like a pain-measuring contest and, while I don't disagree with you for myself, I know people from abusive families who built up their walls until people in their own family barely matter to them, especially versus the pet that helped them feel ok enough to stop having suicidal ideation. And that can make other families unrelatable to them.\n\nAll that said, NTA because it doesn't matter who's loss was human or animal or impactful to the other person, OPs friend was an inconsiderate and selfish AH.", "NTA.  No question.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the world of pain you've been through. Your words offered me comfort, thank you...", "Thank you, I'm really sorry for your loss. I know how it feels to have your world suddenly ripped away too.", "Unfortunately groups like that are scarce in India. I run my own business and focusing on it has been a whole other mental war. I'm so sorry you've had to go through it too. Fuck cancer.", "Thank you", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Please accept my condolences...", "Dad's primary was lung cancer too. I'm sorry you had to go through it, and about your dad too.", "This is a double standard. You're giving, and she's only taking.", "Oh good grief, already NTA and after that detail triple NTA. I think you're learning who your friend really is unfortunately", "Whaaat?  She was giggling on the phone talking to some guy while her poor pup was in the surgery?  WTAF?!?  Some friend she is.", "She does not seem like someone I would call a true friend. That's a fair weather friend. Someone who only values what you can do for them and not the other way around.  \nNTA.", "100 let this person go. You gotta look out for your emotional and mental health first before you even think about hers. You gave a responsible answer. And if she had any kind of empathy she would have responded with I understand.", "I think you found out who your friend is not.", "\u201cNo comparison\u201d means that the two things are so different you can\u2019t even compare them - in this case meaning that a close parent dying is so much bigger than friend\u2019s dog dying that you can\u2019t even compare those levels of grief. So basically saying \u201cno comparison\u201d is making a comparison by saying that the two things being compared are in such different levels it isn\u2019t even a competition.
