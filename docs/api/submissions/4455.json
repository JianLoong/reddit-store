Both hurt like hell, but the loss of a person hurts that much more.\n\nEspecially when it was so sudden.\n\nThe way her pet died, I wouldn't be surprised if that shook you up too. If anything she's the one being insensitive.", "NTA\nDid your \"friend\" do any of those things for you when you lost your dad? If not, she's an emotional vampire.\nI'm very sorry for your loss. I lost my BFF to cancer last year and I'm still not over it, but she would never want me to shut myself in.", "NTA\n\nYou might want to re-evaluate that \"friendship\".\nSo sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nshe's the AH. Cut her loose.", "NTA  Your \"friend\" is unrealistically demanding. Has she been there for you since your father's death? Sounds like she hasn't. No friend has the right to say what her friends can and cannot do. Being on call daily is also not a requirement. I'm dumbfounded.\n\nI'm so sorry for your tragic loss.", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve been there for her, and she hasn\u2019t been there for you. It\u2019s a one-sided relationship. She shouldn\u2019t be creating drama in a time of loss, she lacks awareness and compassion.", "Well, one is a person that is blood related and has been with you for your lifetime up until this point while the other is a pet of someone who you have known for a period that is not as long as you've known the former. It's painful to bear the loss of someone else's pet but it is far less painful than bearing the loss of a person who is very important in bringing you to life.\n\nAs far as this goes, you're NTA because grieving for your loss of your father first instead of your friend's pet is definitely natural. My condolences to you and I know that it is hard to fill up that void in your heart.\n\n(Also, your friend's kind of self-centered since she thinks that her pet must come first before your loved one)\n\n(PS: you're not exaggerating when you say that your father was your world to you, most of us are like that)", "NTA sorry for your loss. Can\u2019t imagine how tough this is for you. Also she\u2019s not a real friend, dump her ass.", "NTA - you had to go through two deaths, even if the dog wasn't yours, you still had to experience someone else's grief on top of your own. She doesn't really sound like a friend", "NTA Your friend isn\u2019t acting like a friend with you.\n\nI once had a close friend that suddenly evolved into us snipping at each other over the period of a year\u2026Until I reached out and asked what had happened; turned out neither of us knew what happened, we just both kept thinking the other hated us and kept on lashing out at the other.\n\nThe point of this being, she could\u2019ve reached out to you to ask what was happening, or about her feelings of betrayal, or anything. Everyone grieves in their own ways, perhaps her being on the phone was her way of dealing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb I don\u2019t know. However, friends give each other the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYou are still grieving your dad. The cancer diagnosis of this dog is a heavy reminder of that and you did a wonderful thing by being there for her through that process. Give yourself some grace, give her a little grace. Maybe a month from now she\u2019ll reach out about all this and apologize. Maybe not.\n\nKeep moving through and processing your own grief. If she comes back, I\u2019d attribute her actions to the grief of her dog being lost and try again. But if she doesn\u2019t, keep being the wonderful person, the wonderful friend, you are.", "NTA. I am so very sorry for your loss. Given how compassionate and selfless you are, I assume your dad was an amazing man to raise someone like you and he would be so proud of you.\n\nYour friend is utterly selfish. Firstly, she knew you'd recently lost one of the most important PEOPLE in your life yet she thought it was acceptable to emotionally dump on you as opposed to any other friend/relative out there- you don't do that to someone... you especially don't equate the loss of a PERSON to the loss of an ANIMAL... There is no comparison whatsoever, yet you treated her with compassion as though it was comparable. At that point I would've been rolling my eyes if I were in your shoes.\n\nShe is no friend whatsoever. Let her mourn the loss of a good and true friendship, and move on with your life with people who do truly value your friendship.", "NTA.  \n\nFirst off sorry for your loss OP.  \n\nI agree with others in saying this sounds like a one way friendship. Both of you are grieving and having people try and alleviate some of your grief shouldn't be seen as downplaying or ignoring hers. You have to take care of yourself and should never feel guilty about it.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need a selfish bitch like that in your life. At all.\n\nUnfollow her on social.", "NTA- I love my dogs, and I grieve hard for my dogs when I lose them. But this person, this is not a friend.", "NAH, you both are grieving. You both need time to come around reality that you will never see your loved ones again. Maybe you can try to reach to your friend and tell them you are still grieving too and you need to process your emotions as they do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So sorry for your loss, OP.", "NTA. Block her now and forever. You have enough on your plate.\n\nI'm so sorry about your dad.", "NTA and I'm so very sorry for your loss.

These people like to be the centre of attention. They can not see you are grieving over your dad (one of the most important persons of your life). I have friends who still mourn the loss of their parent 15 years later (and that is fine ofcourse only telling it to show how short 2 months is). I am so sorry for your loss. Maybe you should put this friendship away for a little bit because it is something you should not have to go through at this point in your grieve. She really is an inconsidirate friend.", "She came for the funeral, and texted me a couple of times after. I couldn't talk to anybody during the month because it was all so sudden. When her dog was getting surgery, she was giggling on the phone talking to some guy. So much so the vet thought her dog was mine.", "Yes, I've told her I'm not mentally okay to check in on her.

I wouldn't consider her a friend. She should have been there for you more, not vice versa.", "I've lost a pet and I've lost a parent. Those losses, I'm sorry to say, are not on the same level.

You are in a fog. Emotions are everywhere. In this time, I dropped two friends who weren't there for me. I didn't have the energy to connect. Why didn't she get in touch with you since you lost your dad? The phone works both ways. I would drop her. You can connect later if you want to. Right now, focus on yourself. What helped me is finding a bereavement group with no timeline. Mine was connected to three hospice we used.  \n\nIf you feel up to it, you can go. I didn't feel up to going until 6 months. It is okay to feel like you are going crazy.  You are not. It is good to find people who are going through the process of living presence to loving memory. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. Don't make drastic decisions  in job etc. I thought I was making rational decisions and afterward, I realized I was not.", "She needs to respect your grieving too she you need to re-evaluate your friendship.", "NTA. I have a very good friend who lost an aunt the day before my aunt died. Both deaths were expected. Her aunt died or COPD and mine died of cancer. I\u2019ve been meaning to text her to see how she\u2019s doing but we all got Covid and we couldn\u2019t even attend the funeral. She also hasn\u2019t texted me but I get it. She\u2019s grieving. But good friends understand that things happen.", "NTA. But I'd say: \"I'm sorry I can't always be 100% available to support you. I think it's hard for us both right now to be each other's rock when we're both still reeling from grief. Let's both try to give each other some extra compassion and space to grieve. As you know, we can be fine one minute or one day, then absolutely crushed the next. During those times, it's of course hard for each of us to be there for someone else. If you don't immediately hear from me, I hope you'll reach out to others in your support system and find the love and understanding you need in that moment and realize I care about you even if I don't have the ability to be someone you can lean on in that moment.\"\n\nShe probably just saw you out having friends support you and felt jealous and insecure and projected that onto you and imagined your indifference to her. You can probably clear it up if you want to. But if you feel that her unkindness was too selfish to forgive and want to just take some distance from her, that's totally okay too. Her loss was more recent, but nothing cuts so deep as a personal family loss and it isn't something you recover from in a couple months. Her expectations of you are unreasonable and you've already done enough to be a supportive friend. Her tantrum sounds emotionally exhausting and it's okay if you aren't up for dealing with that and trying to soothe hurt feelings you did nothing to stir up.", "OP I\u2019ve fought with people when we\u2019ve both been grieving. You can understand how grief and emotions play a role in someone\u2019s actions without ever needing to forgive them. \n\nYour friend is struggling but that does not excuse her from attacking you. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP.", "I am so sorry for your loss.   You are a good person to support your friend in the midst of your own grief.  It's a shame that your friend doesn't recognize what a good friend you are.", "You say there's no comparison then immediately make a comparison. I don't necessarily agree for all circumstances but I think you're right often enough, I was just amused.", "No, i couldn't talk to her about it. She didn't have a dad growing up. It felt wrong to burden her with it. Its only been mom and me that have been there for each other.", "NTA\n\nThis \u2018friend\u2019 is ridiculous- and horrible to you. There is no comparison between the loss of a pet and a parent.\n\nDitch her and take care of yourself"]}
