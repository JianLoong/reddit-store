Sounds like you\u2019ve been there for her, and she hasn\u2019t been there for you. It\u2019s a one-sided relationship. She shouldn\u2019t be creating drama in a time of loss, she lacks awareness and compassion.", "Well, one is a person that is blood related and has been with you for your lifetime up until this point while the other is a pet of someone who you have known for a period that is not as long as you've known the former. It's painful to bear the loss of someone else's pet but it is far less painful than bearing the loss of a person who is very important in bringing you to life.\n\nAs far as this goes, you're NTA because grieving for your loss of your father first instead of your friend's pet is definitely natural. My condolences to you and I know that it is hard to fill up that void in your heart.\n\n(Also, your friend's kind of self-centered since she thinks that her pet must come first before your loved one)\n\n(PS: you're not exaggerating when you say that your father was your world to you, most of us are like that)", "NTA sorry for your loss.

Everyone grieves in their own ways, perhaps her being on the phone was her way of dealing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb I don\u2019t know.

The cancer diagnosis of this dog is a heavy reminder of that and you did a wonderful thing by being there for her through that process. Give yourself some grace, give her a little grace. Maybe a month from now she\u2019ll reach out about all this and apologize. Maybe not.\n\nKeep moving through and processing your own grief.

Given how compassionate and selfless you are, I assume your dad was an amazing man to raise someone like you and he would be so proud of you.\n\nYour friend is utterly selfish. Firstly, she knew you'd recently lost one of the most important PEOPLE in your life yet she thought it was acceptable to emotionally dump on you as opposed to any other friend/relative out there- you don't do that to someone... you especially don't equate the loss of a PERSON to the loss of an ANIMAL... There is no comparison whatsoever, yet you treated her with compassion as though it was comparable.

You can probably clear it up if you want to. But if you feel that her unkindness was too selfish to forgive and want to just take some distance from her, that's totally okay too. Her loss was more recent, but nothing cuts so deep as a personal family loss and it isn't something you recover from in a couple months.

You lost your Dad recently enough that you're probably going to be functioning on autopilot this season, and it might not really hit you until this time next year.\n\nI can't believe you had the bandwidth to deal with her, especially if you're also trying to be there for your Mom as well (you don't mention if she's with you or they were together at the time of his death), or kids who have just lost Grandpa (either your own or nieblings).", "Oh wow,NTA. You actually went above and beyond your duty. Yes,it hurts when you lose a pet,it's awful,but she needs to realize you just lost your father and you are going through a hard time .

You need to block them from your socials for the time being & when you are ready & able to think clearly, reevaluate the friendship.", "Nta. You lost a parent and she lost a pet. There is a massive difference. Your dad most likely had a hand in teaching you to walk and talk and become a functioning child and adult. And he was your dad. She lost her dog, while that is sad the emotional upheaval is different.", "Nta \n\nI lost my pet 4 days ago suddenly but if a friend of my lost her parent(s) suddenly than I have more compassion for her. \nYes a pet can be family but a human is more than that. Its love and communication you lose.", "NTA\n\n>I was with her through it all, from taking her to the vet, her surgery and euthanasia, all the way to cremating her (the dog)\n\nYou were there for her. She's just being horrible and expecting all the attention.", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. Your father just died, if anyone's being mean, it's your friend. Also the expectation that you are required to \"check in every day\" is absurd, even if you weren't grieving, but the fact that you are makes it more ridiculous.", "Jesus fn christ!!!

Then never speak to her again.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHuman vs animal?  Draw your own conclusion.  Sure, we grieve for our pet loss but humans' deaths trump over animals' deaths.  He was YOUR DAD, FFS!  You have every right to grieve over your great loss.  Your friend can grieve over her pet's loss but she couldn't expect you to do the same with her because you have your full plate.  She should have checked ON YOU to see if you're all right, not the other way around. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  I'm sorry about your dad.  My dad died in a similar way, when I was a teenager - he only knew he had cancer for a month, we kids only knew for about two weeks.  I always tell people he died suddenly of lung cancer.  It's a fucked up thing to try to reconcile within yourself - usually a cancer diagnosis means a slow progression, and a bit of time to process what's happening.  Anyway, I can relate, and I'm sorry.", "Holy shit NTA.\n\nSo sorry for your loss.  I lost my dad 4 years ago and completely understand the feeling of not knowing who you are anymore.  It's like a huge part of the foundation of your identity has suddenly vanished.\n\nI also understand losing a pet and how devastating that is.  But you can't be the only one responsible for your friend's mental well being.  I'm guessing she is more of a taker than a giver in general.", "NTA. Losing a parent is hard especially if you know it's coming cause the anxiety builds up.\n\nI (29m)have lost both my parents; my mother while in highschool and my father while in college. My mother was unexpected and died after childbirth because of complications while my father has always been in and out of the hospital for sickle cell, past injuries etc.\n\nPops death still hit like truck even though I knew I was going to lose him eventually. I have been where you have been but don't close yourself off and accept whatever help you can get no matter how small", "This logic like a pain-measuring contest and, while I don't disagree with you for myself, I know people from abusive families who built up their walls until people in their own family barely matter to them, especially versus the pet that helped them feel ok enough to stop having suicidal ideation.

You focus on you right now - some other friend can step up and console her about the loss of her dog.", "NTA and I would seriously wonder how good a friend she is to you", "I'm probably going to get downvoted for my judgment, but I say NAH.\n\nI lost my father to leukemia in 2014, 6 months after his diagnosis, and that felt too quick. Despite ongoing therapy for depression and anxiety over the years, his death is still not something I am able to reconcile with, and honestly don't know if I will ever be able to. There is nothing more painful in life than the loss of a parent.\n\nI lost my \"heart cat\", a three-legged rescue, within 5 days in early October to a previously undiagnosed autoimmune disease at the age of only 4 years old. I have had many pets cross the Rainbow Bridge in my 45 years, but her sudden and unexpected loss has rocked me with a grief that I haven't felt since losing my dad. I'm still really struggling with losing her. We have since opened our hearts and our home to another rescue who was found on the street begging for food, but my little one remains my home and lock screen photos on my phone. I still sleep with her blanket beside my pillow, I just ordered a gorgeous custom gicl\u00e9e print of her, and I still cry for her regularly. Her 5th birthday would have been on December 16th. Right now, it honestly feels as though my heart will never heal. I'm sobbing trying to write this now.\n\nMy point is that death and grief are never the same from person to person, from loss to loss, or from circumstance to circumstance. There is no instruction manual for many things in life, and grieving is one of them. Everyone deals with it differently, and everyone deserves to be treated with patience and sympathy during a time of profound sorrow. You are suffering the tremendous loss of the person you loved and cared for the most in the world and there is nothing in the universe that will ever replace him or fill the void in your heart and your life that his passing has left. Not only is it something you are working through mentally and emotionally, but your time spent caring for him is now something you need to fill with other activities just to keep yourself busy and distracted while you process your grief. It's a lot to work through, it's draining, and there is literally only so much a person can give of themselves to others, even on a good day, before they are completely spent. I am so, so incredibly sorry for your loss. \n\nYour friend is grieving a loss too. While it certainly doesn't feel equal to the loss that you are experiencing, her heart is broken too. For many, a pet is never \"just a pet\". It is a loved member of the family. Those who are fortunate get to spend many years with their companions, some growing up and going through life's milestones and memorable moments with them by their side. That kind of a loss is also tough to navigate. Yes, we can certainly give another animal a loving home after our companion passes, but it doesn't diminish the sadness and emptiness felt by the departure of our furry family members who did nothing but bring us joy and unconditional love during their time on Earth.\n\nI think it's very unfortunate that you and your friend are both grieving right now, because I feel like if the timing had been \"more kind\" (for lack of better phrasing), and your losses had not fallen so closely together, that you would have been there to support one another. Given the circumstances, I do think that you are absolutely allowed to step back and focus your energy on yourself and your healing. You cannot draw water from an empty well, and you very much need, and deserve, to replenish yourself.\n\nPerhaps in time you and your friend will be able to come together to talk about the way things unfolded and how you were both feeling, but that time isn't now.

Just the dog wasn't your family but it was your friends. And your friend must not have a lot of people to reach out to her if she got tilted on you getting support.

I had a 'friend' who did the exact same thing to me when her dog died. She kept calling me days after the dog passed hysterically crying and would be on the phone with me for a while and I had to listen to her crying, it became too much on me. I finally told her to please call someone else because I don't know what to do at this point, maybe she should book an extra time with her therapist to talk this through. She flipped out on me and started talking bad about me to other people. in the end we parted ways.

I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be and what a whirlwind of emotion. I hope you are finding the support you need in this time.\n\nI agree with the consensus that you are NTA. I also agree with the reasoning that most comments gave, that a pet and a parent cannot be compared. You really don\u2019t need judgment and pressure from your friend, especially right now.\n\nBut I wanted to add another sentiment I haven\u2019t seen in the comments. Even without what you are going through, I would find your friend in the wrong for expecting you to be there for her 24/7, and for having unvoiced expectations of exactly *how* you should be supporting her and then judging you based on those. Friends should accept the ways in which they are offered support, even if they are not exactly how they envisioned it. They should not dissolve a friendship based on unvoiced expectations, but instead express them and communicate. And they should not be relying solely on one person like this, to the point that a 2 day gap makes them feel unsupported. For those things, you would be NTA - this is all the more compounded by the fact that she put all those pressures on you when you are going through such a rough time yourself.\n\nDo what you need to do to not feel guilty or bad. If you need to block her for a time or stop seeing her, do that. There may be a time later when you can talk about this and have more closure about the end of the friendship, but for now you need to go through your grieving journey without her voice in your head.", "NTA. We give what we can, and it sounds like you WERE there for her at the most critical time. \n\nI had to cut off my closest childhood friend due to her reaction during one of the hardest times of my life. Everything was about her, and her demands made things even worse for me. It showed me the kind of friendship she was capable of, and the kind of (reciprocal) friendship I actually needed. Sometimes trauma reveals things to us and forces growth. I truly she's doing okay and is happy out there, but I know my boundaries better now and don't create strong bonds with people who need to use me as a crutch.", "The way your friend expects you to be there for her in her grief makes me wonder if she takes *your* grief over losing your father seriously.

I hope you find peace and comfort from being there for him until the end.", "*hugs* very sorry for your loss\ud83d\udc9c\n\nI just wanted to say I've lost both a parent and a pet - my dad passed away unexpectedly a few years back, then this year I had to make the decision to let my cat cross the rainbow bridge (and it was unexpectedly too), and both hit hard but in different ways. Losing a pet is like losing a family member, but I don't think you ever grieve the same way for each loss you experience. I'm with you, OP is NTA, and while the friend is allowed to hurt they are not allowed to put the weight of their hurt on OP's shoulders.", "Oops fixed. Thx!", "NTA and you should cut that friend out of your life", "NTA. \n\nlisten, even if you hadn't lost your dad, you're not the asshole in this situation... but since you did have a recent huge loss, you are definitely not the asshole.\n\nYou're allowed to go out and live your life, even if your friends are hurting. You're allowed to do things that bring you joy, even if your friends are sad. your friend does not get to dictate what you do with your time or how you process things. if they feel hurt that other people are trying to enjoy life even though they are in pain, they need therapy...\n\nyou are grieving, and you need to lean on your support system. I'm very happy to hear that you did, and I'm sorry for your loss. she is clearly not part of your support system, but expects you to be hers regardless of what's going on on your life. personally, I would reevaluate whether she even needs to be in your life.", "NTA\nBut I love how you clarified that it was the dog you helped to have cremated and not the friend.", "NTA", "NTA.  Losing someone you lived with every day who you love deeply is incomparably painful.  It guts your soul for a very long time. You can\u2019t be expected to be able to take on someone else\u2019s grief while you are still suffering. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself and let your true friends help you.  No one else should be judging you.   Everything you feel is valid.", "NTA and so sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself and delete this person from your life. She is not a friend.", "NTA. First off comparing deaths is BS. If it\u2019s a pet or a person doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s devastating. Second, just because you\u2019re grieving doesn\u2019t mean the entire world needs to stop and revolve around you. Everyone grieves differently.  You were there for her then disappeared. It wasn\u2019t like you just ignored her loss. I give you kudos for being there at all. Do what you need for yourself. If she holds a grudge, you\u2019re better off without her.", "NTA. Something very similar happened with me and my best friend when my mother died. My friend was completely not there for me while\nmom was sick with cancer and I didn\u2019t hear from her until a week after mom died when my friend was crying about her dog dying. \n\nI lost it on her and the friendship was done. I could not believe how self absorbed my friend was and then she blamed her \u201cabsence\u201d (not being there for me) on how horrible it was to watch her pet die of cancer. FFS I told her that my mother died of cancer last week! \n\nI was grieving my mother and she was grieving her dog and thought her dog deserved more attention than my mom. I did not need to have this person in my life anymore.", "**NTA**. Her pain does not negate your pain. Did she comfort you after the passing of your father? \n\nOnly one of you is getting the benefits of this friendship, and it's not you.", "Parent trumps dog.\n\nNTA.", "I don't think one can measure love or grief, be it for a pet or for a person. Humans react differently based on circumstances. That said you should never push your grief on someone else. Your father just died, and still you helped her. It would have been totally understandable if you hadn't.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Period. \n\nAnd I'm so, so sorry you're going through such an unimaginable loss. I found that the \"Grief box & ball\" analogy helped me articulate the waves much better...\nWishing you peace and heading \ud83d\udc95", "NTA. Thank God she showed her true colors. Block her on everything and move on. Please take good care of yourself. Hugs \ud83e\udd17", "NTA. Oh, good lord. Sounds like you went above and beyond for her and her dog when you already currently don\u2019t have the mental strength. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and also sorry this person is heaping unnecessary drama on you at the worst possible time.\n\nI\u2019ve lost a parent and I\u2019ve lost dogs. They both hurt, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s comparable. I wasn\u2019t looking for a new mom on Petfinder after a couple months.", "NTA \n\nFFS I lost a dog January 18 and then a second March 28 and at no time did I think anyone needed to call me everyday. My dad passed also and I didn't expect anyone to sit at home or with me everyday watching me cry.  Your dad passed (I'm sorry for your loss. Cancer s*c$) and if you needed/wanted to go out and let off steam that's what you needed to do.\n\nYour friend's grief is theirs, not yours. You did what you could for them. They aren't entitled to you carrying it for them, you obviously have your own to carry. It sounds like the other group knew you needed to fill your cup. \n\nHugs to you.", "NTA I\u2019ve lost pets before and I also lost my own father to cancer. You already did a lot for your friend by being there for her through the process. Even if you were having nothing personal going on yourself, you wouldn\u2019t have done anything wrong by being unavailable for two days after you\u2019d already done so much to support her. You are going through much worse than the loss of a dog. You lost a parent. She is not only being ungrateful, but callous and hypocritical as it does not sound as though she has been there for you.", "This is a tell me your self centered, without telling me your self centered story. \n\nNTA.  Who the hell wants a friend who throws shade on someone for going out while they are grieving and trying to feel better about Life.  It seems it's less about her grieving, and more that everyone should be making her the center of their Universe.  I wouldn't blame OP for going low contact for the foreseeable future.", "NTA, but... has your friend ever lost someone as close to them as a father? I'm going to operate on the assumption she has not. I Iost both my father (2.5 months after his diagnosis) and my older but not old \"heart\" dog (3 weeks after he started going downhill). Both affected me severely. Of course losing a dog isn't the same as losing a parent, but that doesn't mean it's not an insane amount of pain that sometimes requires therapy. It's easy to feel the way you do.. like your friend's issue is way less significant than yours is. But please, please remember that your friend may be going through the worst pain of her life just like you are. It's all relative. The gasping, searing pain you felt losing your dad can also happen for someone losing a pet that has been there for them for a decade + and has helped them get through some bad times. I think you should take it easy on your friend. She can't understand the extent of your pain because she hasn't had to.. and you should be relieved for her that she hasn't because it's horrible. Right now you both have a lot of intense emotions so you should avoid doing anything drastic. I would just tell her that you're sorry you haven't been able to be there for her the way she would like, but you're still dealing with an extremely traumatic event as she knows and you only have so much you can give to others right now before needing to focus on your own grief/life changes. Her emotions may be strong right now but with a little time she should realize her mistake. Also, I am so very sorry for your loss, OP.", "Why are you even asking? She's a lousy friend. Be done with her.", "I am so sorry for your loss.  I lost my dad last month.  It sucks so badly.  I hope it gets better.", "Thank you! We have a new dog now so that's helped a little but yeah, it's been very hard. The anniversary is coming next month and I don't know how I'll deal with it yet. It's the most impactful loss I've personally experienced in my life, and hit me a lot harder than I expected it to. I'm very sorry for your losses too.\n\nAnd yeah, that's the real thing to me, not necessarily comparing or weighing the severity of the losses. That's individual for everyone, but no matter what the loss you can't really expect your friends to be there 24/7 for you while you're grieving. They still have their own lives, and that goes even more so if they're also suffering a significant loss of any kind.", "Respond in kind.  Tell her that losing her dog is at least the same as losing your dad (it isn't - I believe that losing a parent is immeasurably worse, but she won't believe that) and that SHE isn't being a friend to YOU!  At least your friends did something to take you out to make you feel better, she did nothing.  \n\nNTA.  She is not a friend, she is an emotional sponge.\n\nSo very sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA /you are both grieving and your friends wanted to help you feel better, that it not your fault", "NTA you lost your dad and you still stepped up to help her, she\u2019s very insensitive", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYour \"friend\" is. You just lost your dad. You deserved some time out to enjoy yourself and relax, even if it was only for a little while. \n\nHaving lost both parents and pets, there is no comparison.   I don't care how much you love your dog, it is nowhere near losing a parent, especially when you were a caregiver and it was sudden.  The fact that your \"friend\" is chastising you for going out and not checking up on her shows just how selfish she is. OP, was she there for you when you were grieving your dad? \n\nYou don't need that kind of \"friend\" in your life. You would be better off without that BS.\n\nEdit: I am truly sorry for your loss and wish you peace.", "NTA the world doesn't revolve around her and her damn dog.", "Your friend is a self centered prick. How has she been there for your in your time of loss?", "No.\n\nAre you sure she's a friend? She doesn't sound like one.\n\nThis sounds like one of those \"friendships\" that only exist when you're giving them all the attention.", "Look after yourself an let her rant all she wants, ignore her you don't need a friend like that, she's not seeing that you are grieving as well", "NTA she is acting like she\u2019s the only one allowed to grieve. you took on so much to help her when she lost her pet and she\u2019s acting ungrateful. i have known friends like this and they are always the victim, there\u2019s no talking sense into them. so sorry for your loss", "NTA. I love/loved all of my fur babies so much. Im the crazy animal lady. But losing them doesn't compare to when I lost my grandparents. As callous as this may sound, she in time may get another pet. You however, cannot get another dad. Im so incredibly sorry for your loss. To me it sounds like you supported her more through her loss than she supported you through yours. I think you found out who your friend really is. Do you really want someone in your life who cannot fathom your ability to cope and function at the moment?", "NTA, I\u2019m sure your friend had a harrowing experience but as someone who lost my nana, my mum *and* my childhood dog to cancer, I can say with confidence you just can\u2019t let your own grief make you disregard someone else\u2019s.\n\nTwo months in basically no time at all when grieving a close family member. Especially a parent. She needs to be more considerate of your pain, especially with how considerate you already have been of her own. She also needs to find someone else to off load her burden onto and YOU need to do yourself justice and make your boundaries clear. \n\nYou are not obligated to text her every day and she shouldn\u2019t, and does not have the right to yell at you for not doing so.", "I did. She said so what? My dog died too and you never checked up on me again.", "NTA. I had a long-distance friend who 20 years ago resented that I wasn\u2019t present enough after her miscarriage. Later I explained to her that I was struggling with depression at the time. She was totally understanding and we now live in the same city and are very close. Maybe time will heal this, but if not, then she is not the kind of compassionate friend you need in your life. It\u2019s acceptable and natural to rearrange friendships as we grow and get clearer about what we want and need for ourselves.\n\nI am sorry about your dad. I too lost both my parents to cancer quickly after diagnosis (3 months for him and 3 weeks for her) and many years later it is still hard, not gonna lie. Things will get better but for now it\u2019s perfectly fine to fold into yourself and grieve. You will never forget who truly steps up for you at this time.\n\nAnd if you find down the road that a person who wasn\u2019t there for you had good reason for it, I am sure you will treat them with same grace that you deserve now.\n\nLove to you.", "I\u2019m so sorry. She is not your friend. Block her.", "NTA. You are a good friend and she is a terrible one who sounds like an incredibly insensitive narcissist. So sorry for your loss. It\u2019s very hard to lose a parent, especially so suddenly.", "NTA. Ask her why SHE didn't check in with you for two days. Phones work both ways.", "NTA - you\u2019re so not the asshole. I had a very similar experience when my dad suddenly died. A friends cat died and she got really angry that I wasn\u2019t there for her.  I tried to explain that I literally, physically, and mentally was unable to.", "NTA \n\nVery sorry for the loss of your father. \n\nAnd yes the pet owner is grieving too but her post was over the line as was her comment about not being there for her.  \n\nIf you want to be generous I would text her back that losing your father has impacted you significantly.  And while you do feel bad for the loss of pup that your focus at this time needs to be working through your own grief for your father what ever form that takes. \n\nThen block her everywhere until you decide you can talk with her or not.", "NTA- I lost my father and my pet of 16 years in the same week. Both sucked. I felt the pet's loss more immediately, because he lived with me. I still feel the loss of my father when I see a market advertised, or I sit down to watch the Mummy.\n\nNot. The. Same.", "NTA.  So sorry for your loss.   \n\nLet your friend know that you do feel bad for the loss of her much loved pet, but that you just don\u2019t have room in your thoughts for it right now as you\u2019re too busy grieving for your own loss.", "wow that\u2019s awful, i would be an emotional wreck if my cat were in surgery. poor dog :((( you really lost two loved ones", "Wow, you're criticizing her behavior during her pet's surgery so people will decide for you? Hey, maybe she didn't realize her dog's condition was so serious. Maybe she was venting with laughter. Maybe she just welcomed the distraction. \n\nFor sure though, YTA.", "she doesn\u2019t deserve anymore of your emotional energy \u2014 she is a vampire and not respecting your boundaries. time to cut her off", "I think it's best for your friend that you let go. You suck.", "OP is not so subtly lobbying for people to vote her way, by trashing her \"friend's\" behavior. What a shit person OP is.", "Exactly. Yet OP is using it to turn people against her friend. Frankly, it makes me think OP sucks.", "I lost my dad in 1982. Yesterday while decorating my tree I suddenly burst into tears over the loss of him. This almost never happens anymore but there are those times that just come out of the blue and remind you of exactly what you lost. And of course it's the holidays.\n\nTwo months, you're skin is still raw with grief. And everything hurts. You are exactly right, OP needs set the friendship to the side and take care of her loss which is monumental.", "Exactly. Two months is nothing. It's like it just happened. It took a solid year for me to be able to think about my dad's death and not immediately dissociate. My condolences on your loss, OP. Fuck cancer.", "I am so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent \u00eds monumental. I hope you will have all the good memories next to your sadness and grieve. Both can coexist next to each other."]}
