My ex-wife and D were particularly close because they were very close in age, so they treated each other more like sisters. \n\nOnly a few weeks after we were married, P died suddenly in an accident. D had 2 young kids (1 and 2) at the time  We went to the funeral and did all the family things and then my parents decided that since P was dead, D was no longer technically family. So, we all stopped seeing her and the kids at my parents' request.\n\nWell I didn't know this but all that time, my ex wife was in contact with D over email and eventually social media. No one else in the family was close to D or even seeing her and the kids at this time. Because again, my uncle was dead, so she was no longer my aunt. Why should my ex wife be in contact with them? There is no reason.\n\nWell about 12 years after P died my wife and I divorced. After the divorce, my ex wife started spending more and more time with D, who by now was remarried and had a daughter (K) the same age as my middle kid (these two are now 17, I have two other kids as well). My kids would tell me about all the time they spent with \"cousin\" K and each time I would tell them she is not their cousin. They would then ask me if A and J (D's boys with my late uncle) were their cousins and I would tell them technically yes. They would say that since K is the sister of A and J, that makes her their cousin as well. I told them that's not how it works. Despite this, my ex wife and my kids kept spending time with D and the kids, especially K. \n\nJust this past week, my two younger kids told me they were going to \"aunt D's\" for Thanksgiving to see her and K and the surviving son of P, along with his wife and kids. (The older son of P died last year, also in an accident.)  I was very upset and told my children again that D is not their aunt and K is not their cousin, that D and K are just regular people. My son who is the same age as K said that's not true and he has really enjoyed having a cousin only a few weeks younger than him while he has been growing up, and that he really misses his cousin A and wants to see his room and visit his things so he can feel like A is still alive. I told him that my brother's 2 kids are his cousins but that's all the cousins he has, that I'm sorry A died but he was not their cousin, and that they are no longer allowed to refer to D as \"aunt\" in my presence.  The kids said that's not fair and that's all they've ever known her as. I told them that could not possibly be true because P died before any of them were born so they should never have called them family in the first place. They said I was being a jerk.\n\nSo am I?", "created_utc": 1700528339, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1804g2h/aita_for_telling_my_kids_not_to_call_her_their/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So let me get this straight. Your uncle dies suddenly,  leaving behind a young widow and two very little children. You claim you all had a close relationship with the couple, but you, instead of ralling around the distraught widow and the kids  drop her as  a hot plate, leaving her alone, in need and taking care of two young children, while grieving her husband. Your ex-wife, being a good friend and a compassionate human being, keep contact with her. And you lost your mind for your kids being close and calling \"aunt\" to a close woman in their life who loves them and treat them right, who also lost her young son in top of her husband. You are an asshole, a despicable human being and I hope your kids keep referring to aunt D as aunt D for the rest of their lives. Also, tell them exactly how you all abandoned a young widow and his second cousins without regrets so they can see how horrible you really are and keep their distance from all of you except for their mother and aunt D. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you are in the wrong. All widows keep their titles and family relations through history when their spouse died, because the marriage was not legally dissolved for any of the part's wish, but they were married when one of them died. So you are not only the asshole, but wrong. The widow of a person's family remain being family all their life.", "Yes absolutely YTA, and so are your parents and anyone else who listened to them. Your ex-wife and kids are the only ones who aren\u2019t. First off, you don\u2019t get to tell your grown/mostly grown children who they can have in their lives and how they address that person. If she\u2019s cool with them calling her auntie then that has zero to do with you. Second, you should be ashamed of yourself for walking away in the first place. The sudden tragic death of her spouse, and then all her in-laws suddenly treat her and her children like lepers. Wow, I can\u2019t imagine a more isolating and horrible feeling. Unless there\u2019s something horrible that she did that you havent mentioned, but given that both your ex wife and your uncle P\u2019s surviving son both have relationships with her I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not that. Why would your parents ask such a thing of you? And why would you, as an adult, agree?", "Dammit. I forgot to tell my aunt that she's not my aunt anymore now that my uncle is dead. I guess she's just my cousins' mom now. WTF?\n\nK might not be their cousin but it's totally okay to feel that way.  A and J are their cousins. Why throw in \"Technically?\" Oh that's right, because you and your family are massive assholes that somehow don't think that kids having half of your family's DNA are family. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with you people?  \n\n\n\"that I'm sorry A died but he was not their cousin\"  \nA? A, the son of P, your dad's brother? A was absolutely their cousin.\n\nI think you need a dictionary. \n\nJerk is letting you off easy.   \nYTA. All of y'all.", "Are you serious? Of course she's their aunt. And her kids are your nephews. How cruel does a family have to be to kick a woman out like she didn't matter when her husband died? The whole lot of you are disgusting assholes. YTA", "YTA.  People find family where they can.  And if your kids find family with those related to them partly by marriage, partly by blood, parely because they just like each other, then who are you to stand in their way?", "YTA. Besides all the other reasons that everyone else has given here, have you considered that your ex and your kids hang out with them and visit them just because they like them? This is the reason why your ex should be in contact with D - she *liked* her and didn't abandon her just because the person she was married to died. It's called friendship. \n\nYour kids have understood something that you missed - family is not about who married who, but its about who you love and who stands by you when times are hard. And, by that definition, you are correct - D and her kids are not *your* family, but she is obviously family to your ex and your kids, and yelling at your kids not to call them that not only is not going to change that, you run the risk of alienating your own children. All because you want to continue to justify a decision your family made years ago.", "It's not your place to tell your children what to call someone they view as family despite your coldhearted view of what makes someone family.  YTA", "YTA, as are your parents. Your parents dismissed two of their grandchildren because their father died? Seriously? \n\nIn the end, your kids are much better off having a relationship with P and her children than they are your side of the family.", "YTA\n\n>They said I was being a jerk.\n\nOn the bright side you have children who are very astute. Their judgement of people is spot on. And you can use fake names instead of alphabet people.", "You are disgusting.  And your uncle would be horrified by how you all abandoned his wife after he died.  Wow.  YTA.  So much the AH", "YTA what is wrong with all of you?", "YTA. No matter how many times I get down voted in this sub I\u2019m still remain adamant that the concept (that I mostly associate with white people) of a \u201chalf\u201d sibling is crazy. Not to be disrespectful to y\u2019all, but it\u2019s almost like a trigger for me. \n\nSo your uncle who you & your family deemed less than because he was only \u201chalf\u201d related to your dad, died & y\u2019all all collectively decided that you want nothing to do with his children (aka your nieces & cousins)? Now your mad that your ex wife decided that the death of said uncle doesn\u2019t mean she should have to severe her ties from the pre existing relationship he had with her widow? Did I read that right? You\u2019re even saying that your cousins are not your cousins?\n\nLmaooooo. I cannot believe I get this sort of content free of charge", "All I can say is that I am really happy that your wife divorced you.  The sooner your children have no further contact with you or your parents the better.\n\nYTA", ">So am I?\n\nYes and so are your parents.\n\nYTA. Your family abandoned your aunt and your cousins after your uncle's death and you're quibbling because your kids consider their non blood cousins as family?\n\nI can't put into words what I really think about you, your parents and your weird concept of family as I'd get turfed from the sub.", "YTA. It's fine to explain what the relationships are or are not, but the kids seem happy so why take it away from them?  \n\nIf they all get along well with one another, let the call each other anything they want. Lots of people have \"honorary\" aunts and uncles who aren't blood relations. \n\nAnd it's a shame that your parents felt the way they did.  Now would be a good time to break this intergenerational cycle of pettiness and teach your children the value of good relationships no matter what you call each other.", "YTA-Stop trying to gatekeep family. Family is more than blood or biology.", "\"Aunt\" is often a term of respect for a female of an older age who is a friend of your parent.\n\nI see why you have trouble using it though, as you dont seem to have any respect for this lady.\n\nYTA", "By your logic, when you die, your kids will no longer be cousins with anyone on your side of the family. No longer have any aunts or uncles or even grandparents. \n\nGet over it. Because those people will be at your kids's weddings and big events. If you want to be in your children's adult lives, get over yourself. \n\nYTA", "Yes, YTA. You, your dad and anyone else who cut D out of their lives are AHs.\n\nHow dare you withdraw family and kinship from your aunt D on the basis that your uncle, her husband died? What a horrible thing to do to someone grieving! No matter what your dad requested, your (now ex) wife was right to continue to keep D in her and your children's lives.\n\nIt's also horrible for your children, to tell them that their auntie's children are not their cousins. Accuracy over the title of relationships is less meaningful than healthy familial bonds.\n\nFurther, to tell your children off for wanting to spend Thanksgiving with their aunt and cousins, especially after the recent loss of one of their cousins, is appalling. The first few Thanksgivings and Christmases after losing a child are really hard. It is unforgivable that you want your children to turn their back on your aunt and her remaining children after this bereavement just like you did after your uncle died.\n\nWhat your dad asked you all to do to D on the loss of your uncle P and what you're asking your children to do to D, especially given the relatively recent loss of her child  A, are equally appalling. Your dad taught you a very messed up idea of family and you're passing it along to your kids. They will not thank you for this.\n\nYou and your dad are both TA so many times over. Your children are right to call you a jerk.", "YTA. Since they enjoy each other's company, what does it matter if some are technically not related?\n\nAnd your family cut off P's kids just because he died? They're no longer \"family\"? That sounds cruel.", "YTA because there are several cultures that recognize close friends of the family as aunts even if it's an honorific title. You're being much too strict about this and it doesn't matter if she was married to your uncle at one point or never was, if she's someone who's close to your wife then it's perfectly fine if her children call her aunt and think of her children as their cousins. I don't understand why this is a hill you want to die on regardless. It's another group of people that love your kids, and that should be enough for you.", "Is this a joke? I\u2019m amazed at the level of asshole-ness and straight up delusion here. I don\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s real. YTA my god", "[removed]", "You have to be one of the most classless, inhuman, assholes of a person I've ever encountered.

Entitled AH.", "> then my parents decided that since P was dead, D was no longer technically family. So, we all stopped seeing her and the kids at my parents' request.\n\nwhat the absolute fuck \n\nYTA\n\nedit: as someone with a bunch of extended family that I consider cousins and aunts and uncles even though they\u2019re not blood related, this is disgusting to me. My dad tried to pull this shit regarding some of my aunts after my parents got divorced and I shut it down immediately. they are my family. that doesn\u2019t change just because of a divorce or a death.", "YTA 100% wtf is wrong with you?", "[removed]", "YTA you are absolutely being an asshole here.\n\nYour parents were also assholes for deciding to cut off your uncle's widow. It's not like they divorced, she was WIDOWED and his family chose to ignore her, that's awful. Especially as HER CHILDREN WERE YOUR NEPHEWS.\n\nRegardless. Even if she wasn't literally your aunt (which she IS, this isn't something that disappears on marriage), she is also your children's honorary aunt through her relationship with their mother, which is something they have all chosen. \n\nFamily isn't always about by blood and you are being ridiculous by trying to control your kids emotions through logic. Weird twisted sociopath logic.", "YTA. Pretty obvious of why you're a bitter divorced \"dad.\" Your kids know the true meaning of family more than you ever will. You sound jealous of their connections. I doubt you have anything fulfilling or substantial of your own.", "I'm confused why you care.

You probably will be TA if you're going to make a big fuss about it unless there's a better reason than \"but she isn't!!!\"", "YTA. Your family sucks. Uncle dies so aunt by marriage doesn't exist to you anymore? Real nice. /s Also, death did not negate their marriage. She isn't an ex-wife.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nNew to this forum so I will try to make this simple. \n\n25 years ago, when I married my now ex-wife, we were very close to my uncle P (my dad's younger half brother) and his wife, my aunt D. My ex-wife and D were particularly close because they were very close in age, so they treated each other more like sisters. \n\nOnly a few weeks after we were married, P died suddenly in an accident. D had 2 young kids (1 and 2) at the time  We went to the funeral and did all the family things and then my parents decided that since P was dead, D was no longer technically family. So, we all stopped seeing her and the kids at my parents' request.\n\nWell I didn't know this but all that time, my ex wife was in contact with D over email and eventually social media. No one else in the family was close to D or even seeing her and the kids at this time. Because again, my uncle was dead, so she was no longer my aunt. Why should my ex wife be in contact with them? There is no reason.\n\nWell about 12 years after P died my wife and I divorced. After the divorce, my ex wife started spending more and more time with D, who by now was remarried and had a daughter (K) the same age as my middle kid (these two are now 17, I have two other kids as well). My kids would tell me about all the time they spent with \"cousin\" K and each time I would tell them she is not their cousin. They would then ask me if A and J (D's boys with my late uncle) were their cousins and I would tell them technically yes. They would say that since K is the sister of A and J, that makes her their cousin as well. I told them that's not how it works. Despite this, my ex wife and my kids kept spending time with D and the kids, especially K. \n\nJust this past week, my two younger kids told me they were going to \"aunt D's\" for Thanksgiving to see her and K and the surviving son of P, along with his wife and kids. (The older son of P died last year, also in an accident.)  I was very upset and told my children again that D is not their aunt and K is not their cousin, that D and K are just regular people. My son who is the same age as K said that's not true and he has really enjoyed having a cousin only a few weeks younger than him while he has been growing up, and that he really misses his cousin A and wants to see his room and visit his things so he can feel like A is still alive. I told him that my brother's 2 kids are his cousins but that's all the cousins he has, that I'm sorry A died but he was not their cousin, and that they are no longer allowed to refer to D as \"aunt\" in my presence.  The kids said that's not fair and that's all they've ever known her as. I told them that could not possibly be true because P died before any of them were born so they should never have called them family in the first place. They said I was being a jerk.\n\nSo am I?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH\n\nYou and D took moments that had nothing to do with you and made it your personal show. She shouldn\u2019t have kept you from participating as family during the funeral. So if she doesn\u2019t see you as family, she shouldn\u2019t be upset when that energy is returned. \n\nBut you don\u2019t need to add another generation to this unnecessary conflict. If you don\u2019t consider her an aunt or her kids cousins, cool. You don\u2019t have to. But if your kids are willing to have them as family, let them. People have play cousins all the time. Make sure she treats your kids right and she also isn\u2019t spouting none sense about your family and let it go. If you don\u2019t think your kids understand, then explain why YOU feel that way but you support them reaching out to family. \n\nThis seems childish on all sides.

B's wife would not be called your aunt, it would be weird to call her your aunt, she's just Kathy or your \"uncle's wife\"- maybe \"aunt in law\" if you are particularly close.
