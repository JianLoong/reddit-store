Let me start off by saying that my actual wife and I have a great relationship.  We've been married 15 years.  Nobody has ever cheated. I would never - emotionally or physically.  Nor would my wife. \n\nAbout a year ago, an employee, with whom I have worked closely for 10 years, started calling herself my \"work wife\".   I didn't think anything about it.    I guess I thought of it as a joke.  I have not described this woman as such to anyone at work or anywhere else, but she has given herself this label, which other people at work have heard her say, and I have heard her say. \n\nThrough a work friend, my wife found out about this and she hit the fucking roof.  In 15 years, I have never seen her so mad.  When she asked me about it, I didn't even hesitate in telling her \"yeah, she's been doing that for about a year\", because I just didn't think it was a big deal. But, that only made things worse.  \n\nShe has been fuming for a few days.  She has even dug through my texts and emails, just to see how much this term has been used.  (Apparently 3 or 4 times in my texts and emails over the past year).  She has never dug through my stuff before, so clearly this has really hit her in a way that nothing else has.  I'm not even mad at her for doing it, because I really don't feel like I have anything to hide, but she did, which is very unusual for her.\n\nFor context, I have had a project where I have been traveling a lot, for weeks, with my employees, this woman included.  She is, I suppose, reasonably attractive, but I don't find her attractive at all, and my wife knows this.  However, my employee has a history of kind of being manipulative at work.\n\nSo, my wife is super mad, and I have told her that I will tell this woman to stop referring to herself this way.  My wife says she's humiliated by this and her title as my wife has been cheapened.  And basically that I'm an idiot with no boundaries for allowing this to go on unchecked for so long.   \n\nI'm not really even defending it, because now that I have heard her complaint, I see that I probably should have done something sooner, but I guess I just thought this was harmless work banter.  But, still, I got mad back at my wife, because I felt like she is reacting as if I have been cheating and reading way too much into this.  \n\nSo, Reddit, AITAH?", "created_utc": 1695542170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qruo0/aitah_for_letting_an_employee_call_herself_my/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it possible your wife picked up on signals your coworker is sending that you've been oblivious to?\n\nI ask because my husband was oblivious to his coworkers infatuation with him. I never accused him of anything inappropriate though, because I know and trust him. I also know he can miss signals big enough to be seen from space. You can probably guess how I know lol.", "YTA for getting mad at your wife for having a normal reaction to *another woman calling herself your wife for over a year and doing nothing to stop it.*\n\nI don't understand how you thought this was ok. For so many reasons. \n\nOne, you're the boss and a subordinate is calling herself your \"work wife\" to other employees. What if any of those employees had an issue with her? Could they come to you with the problem? Or would they feel like you're going to pick favorites or side with this woman and possibly retaliate against them? Is she leveraging this stupid title against them to pawn off her work or responsibilities on them?\n\nTwo, you have a wife. A real wife. How would you feel about some guy your wife works with and goes on work trips with calling himself her husband? Probably not great. Especially if it's been going on for over a year and she didn't put a stop to it.\n\nThree, not putting a stop to something indicates that on some level you either approve of the thing or at least have no problems with it. I can't imagine how you could even remotely think your wife would be ok with you thinking it's cool for some other woman to call herself your wife.\n\nFour, you sound like a reasonably intelligent person from your post. So this \"oh gosh golly gee I had no clue\" reaction comes off as really disingenuous. You knew this was wrong, which makes you TA. And if you didn't mind, you knew that was even more wrong and that makes you an even bigger TA.\n\nFive, you got mad at your wife for having a normal reaction to both discovering this bs *and* to what sound an awful lot like milquetoast bs excuses.\n\nShut this shit down at work immediately, never let it happen again, and apologize profusely to your wife.", "My husband had a co-worker, we were both friends with, refer to herself as his \"work wife\". I didn't care. After a while, she started getting obnoxious and \"threatened\" to call me constantly for stupid stuff he did that she didn't like.

You describe this woman as manipulative, and you didn't think anything was wrong with her announcing to the world that she was your work wife? \n\nYour wife is absolutely correct. This is so disrespectful. Of course she thinks you're cheating. I would if I were her.\n\nIf I were you, I'd give the employee an official warning about addressing you, her boss, so intimately and that failure to comply will result in termination. You need to put her in her place in public, it is the only way to even try to remedy the humiliation you heaped on your wife. Man, you suck.", "YTA. My ex husband left me for his work wife.", "My ex H had a work wife too. They\u2019re married now. I should have been suspicious, but I wasn\u2019t, so I can understand your wife\u2019s reaction.", "YTA. Work wife is a fun term in the office for single people. You aren't a single person.

You clearly know reddit. How many times have I read shit about \"work wife/husband\" and how much issues it has caused? A fuckin lot. A lot of the time it has lead to cheating as well. Her concerns are not unfounded or crazy.. I feel like you knew all of this....you know all of this. \n\nMy guess is when the employee started doing it you did have that feeling of it being inappropriate but you also knew it would be awkward to bring it up and told yourself \"its just a joke, whatever, ignore it\". I don't buy that you were completely naive or ignorant about this being inappropriate and how it would probably make your wife feel. \n\nBlowing up over this is not great. So yeah it sucks that she did, but you also said you did in return to an extent....so I'm just ignoring that aspect when judging. You both did it, it sucks, work on it and improve in future. So the fact that, in my opinion, you are playing dumb, hid it from your wife in some capacity (failure to mention counts) and let it go on for a year....YTA. \n\nI'm glad this wasn't a cheater story though.

Husband and Wife are sacred titles. We choose who we give them to and your wife is right. Allowing someone else to call themselves your work \"wife\" cheapens the title.

Respect her wishes and fix this asap.", "\"Idiot with no boundaries\" pretty much sums it up. YTA. For starters, this whole \"work wife\" talk is based around an assumption of what a wife should be. Secondly, it's indeed disrespectful to your wife. Thirdly, the fact that she gave herself that title raises a lot of red flags.

Yeah that's a huge red flag, quite literally the biggest and reddest flag. \n\nI won't say you're the asshole, stuff like this will usually fly over guys heads so I understand your side.

Mainly because you should have been more on the ball and discerned this woman who described herself as your work wife was trying to manipulate by giving herself that title to either ingratiate herself to you personally or professionally.\n\nI get it, I used to see it as an innocent term too.  At a company I worked for previously there was a really cute and smart girl that started, now I will admit I found her attractive but she was engaged and that is a big no to me.  I have morals.\n\nI did enjoy working with her because she was super smart, we both were very skilled at our work and really enjoyed working with each other because we learned from the other (I taught her technical skills, she taught me client facing skills) that made us better.  She referred to herself as my work wife and I was her work hubby and I thought it was just cute\u2026\n\nUntil she started hitting on me and making it clear she wanted to be with me\u2026. While she was still engaged.  I was really tempted, but morally I couldn\u2019t do that to her, her fianc\u00e9 (who I knew) or myself because I knew it would just ruin everything.  So turned her down gently, letting her know I was really tempted, but I didn\u2019t want to do wrong by her or her fianc\u00e9.  She accepted my reasoning and grew really distant, which hurt because I felt like I lost a great friend.\n\nShe got married and when she got back from her honeymoon she asked me to get coffee where she explained she really appreciated the fact I turned her down.  She really loved her husband but got cold feet.  She was attracted to me so in a moment of weakness she succumbed to her desires.  She really respected that I held to my morals and protected her from making a mistake that would have destroyed her.  If she had gone through with it she would never have forgiven herself.  \n\nWe were able to build a more healthy friendship with some boundaries clearly in place and I consider her one of my best friends today.  Her daughters call me Uncle and while we are still close there is nothing potentially inappropriate.  That experience did make me more mindful at work and how my female coworkers approach me.", "Alright, alright, so I think this is soo f-ing messy. I read someone say Gen-Z mind might find work-wife/husband dated, I am millenial (side parts for life!!!), so maybe there is a difference already.\nGenerally I do not see it as an issue. Obviously if your wife does have an issue with it, it becomes an issue no question about it. Of course it is made more difficult and messy if you have never communicated about it. \nHooweever here comes where I have an issue with it, you said this woman is known to being manipulative at work. That can be a very dangerous situation in multiple facets. I remember my mother being really good friends with someone for years and years because simply if she wasn\u2019t her friend, she might become a target and was almost fired because this later \u2018friend\u2019 tried to manipulate her boss into firing my mother. \nAnd you seem like a nice and upstanding guy, who are often more at risk to be a target for whatever manipulation that is planned.\nSo in summary, yes I believe YTA, but especially because of the person.\nI think it is good you are trying to make it right.", "NTA\n\nMost of my friends have work husbands and wives etc. It's just a casual joke among them.

Is the work woman married, single or what?", "By the same standard, how would you know they\u2019re frequently the source of massive marital problems at home?", "I disagree with you here.  As a US born and bred woman who is older than generation Z, it has nothing at all to do with either language or age.   I've worked in environments that were predominately male for my whole career and while I have been close to some co-workers, I would never, ever want to be considered any kind of office wife and I've never seen such a situation that did not make some others uncomfortable.", "So your management style encourages inappropriate boundary stomping.   From what you said in other comments, this woman sows discomfort with other employees and yet you seem okay with.   With or without the problems she has created for you personally at home, you should probably give some thought about how to rein her in.", "I suspect the Peter Principle is at work here. OP was promoted to the level of his incompetence.\n\nThis sort of thing is why when I get asked at work, \"Which track do you see yourself progressing down, being an individual contributor or going into management,\" I am VERY CLEAR that I want to be an individual contributor!", "This part\u2026it literally isn\u2019t that serious \ud83e\uddd0 and is reserved for people you legitimately have a reciprocal friendship bond with you care about their lives, spouses, kids etc more than any random coworkers. I have a round the clock job that is fire drill prone. If you are with people 50-80 hours a week you are gonna become friends", "Genuine question: are you people not familiar with words like \"colleague\" and \"coworker\"?", "If someone started calling me their \"work wife\" I would shut that shit down immediately because it's inappropriate. I'm my husband's wife, those words are special to me.", "I guess you're just skipping past all the posts saying that work wife AND work husband are weird and inappropriate phrases", "This is an incredibly stupid comment. Just thought you should know. \n\nIt\u2019s fucking weird regardless of gender to refer to someone as a work husband or wife. It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s an insinuation that two people are incredibly close and spend enough time together that they\u2019re practically married. \n\nThat\u2019s fucking weird.", "That's funny cause most of the posts I've seen where op is the woman and had a work husband they were called out for being t a. We know nothing of op's wife's past relationships so she may very well have a reason to be insecure. Not saying op did or has done anything but sometimes things like this can cause past issues/trauma to resurface even from past relationships. \n\nIn all honesty it sounds like this woman was using their 10+ years of knowing each as a power move. I'm going with slight YTA here because it seems like op truly didn't realize it was or could be an issue until now. Plus from the looks of it op is taking the steps to nip this in the bud now and make it up to his wife.", "Don't think so- the creepy factor goes both ways and I highly doubt that if situations were reversed, the husband would be told he was \" overreacting\". \n\nAnd if it's truly been your experience that reddit is so sexist, maybe.... Go to another thread and stop making useless generalizations, because you're clearly exaggerating ? Or hey - maybe you don't have to come here at all!  That's an option! Have a great day!", "Boomer here. Never heard it from people my age- only younger colleagues", "Never heard it until about 10 yrs ago, from a friend whose married assistant called herself his work wife", "lol what?", "10000% agree. This is YOU setting a boundary, do not escape that by putting it on your wife and then confiding this in your coworker making it a you and coworker versus your wife thing. You take ownership and you set the boundary.", "Yes, that\u2019s how I understood it\u2019s use as well. Additionally there is a fair amount of actual affairs going on at my job so it\u2019s also a matter of \u201cwhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire.\u201d", "It is unfortunate that infidelity is so prevalent anymore that a friendship between coworkers is interpreted as inappropriate.", "I haven\u2019t read through this whole thread so I don\u2019t know if my experience is the norm or not.", "Now that I am thinking about it, if she hasn't, she probably would.  My wife calls it a \"flex\" and she is probably right.  My wife is way more in tune with social dynamics than I am. I tend to just ignore them.  With that said, I am close enough to other employees that they have no problem complaining about her when there are issues. But to deny that it could play a role in somebody's decision to speak up would probably be wrong. This is partly why I feel very dumb here, because I am protective of the work environment and generally try to be a good boss, but I didn't see all aspects of this. And that  is part of why my wife is mad, I think.", "This. When you shut it down, have an objective third party with you.", "Why is someone an asshole for not defending themselves? Since when is it a requirement to confront people who harass you?", "I could see something like \"work wife/work husband\" being sexual harassment depending on how insistent one party is about it and how unwilling the other party is to receive that commentary. But the thing is, OP is in a unique position where *he has the power to stop it immediately.* He's the manager! \n\nWeirdly, as the manager, he has the responsibility (as the manager) to himself (as an employee of the company) to take appropriate action to stop her.\n\nManagers are responsible for taking action to stop sexual harassment for *everyone's* sake.", "Wrong, but good try", "That's fair. It doesn't sound like he was actively encouraging her behavior so I'm sure he didn't intentionally mean any harm.", "No, *ground* for divorce!", "Thank you. I would definitely appreciate the link.  Nothing is more important to me than my wife, so you can bet that this will be my priority for as long as it takes.", "That hadn't occurred to me.  I think you might be on to something there.", "She has a long-term live-in boyfriend.", "Because I *have* seen the fallout from situations such as this where a longtime work situation that employees have taken for granted has \"inexplicably\" led to marital discord manifested in escalating  The fact that most people didn't think it was serious and just accepted it turned out to be false.", "I know reddit can't be used as a trusted source but there are countless stories about this thing causing massive marital issues on it.", "Exactly", "Ha ha ha ha\ud83d\ude02", "Colleague and coworker refer to acquaintances you work with. Work wife/work hubby/work bestie refer to people you have a closer bond with than acquaintances who you also happen to work with", "Can you please send links to those posts? I'm here a lot and I don't seem to remember... Even one of them.", "Gen X here, I've heard it for years. The main one I worked with for about 8 years was a guy and woman. They would argue like husband and wife, but they always had each other's back and help out the other one. One black other white, about 10 yr age difference. He was married and she had a long time BF.", "The onl6 person I've known to use that term definitely wasn't having an affair no", "Just curious in that you say you\u2019re protective of the work environment, this woman is according to you a position of authority akin to you and yet you\u2019ve seen situations where she was manipulating employees and now with the \u201cwork wife\u201d stunt. I mean you obviously see the damage done to your relationship but she\u2019s clearly damaging in the workplace as well. Is she on a PIP for these behaviors or anything because it seems like she feels comfortable acting out at the detriment of the workplace?", "The fact that you have let her do it for over a year tells your employees you are OK or even approve of the moniker. Thus, she will be viewed as someone you may have feelings for or be close to. \n\nSomeone telling your wife, could be more of tipping her off and bringing situation into the open when they didn't feel safe to talk to you.", "Even better, if it would not be seen as hostile.", "How was OP harassed? He wasn't even uncomfortable.", "Your comment history says otherwise. I\u2019m actually impressed with how dead on I was.", "Plus if you would have told her it would have given her a chance to explain why she was uncomfortable. Then you would have been able to stop it. No offense but it really comes across as if you didn\u2019t really understand the actual meaning behind it and thought it was harmless. Like the comment before it\u2019s all about communication. Good luck.", "To a narcissist, this hardly matters. If she\u2019s as manipulative as you describe, the bf is only there to make her feel better about herself", "Many, many people who get caught up in inappropriate relationships at work have trusting partners at home.   And to address your opening sentence, research has shown that happy marriage is no protection from getting involved in an affair.   In other words, the markers you use to \"prove\" that what your employee/colleague is doing is okay mean nothing.", "And I have seen such situations that have ended up in close friendships between the work wife and the wife.\n\nYour experiences on the topic don\u2019t in any way negate mine, nor the reverse.", "I don\u2019t doubt it.\n\nWhat I said in my original comment is purely my experience from the many people I\u2019ve known over the decades.\n\nCertainly others can have completely different experiences. And no doubt do.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to be all knowing/experiencing.", "So, friends?  Why not just call them friends?", "So call them friends, the whole addition of \"wife/husband\" is incredibly disrespectful towards the actual spouse.", "Work bestie is so much better imo", "My workplace is weird in a lot of ways so I\u2019m not surprised if the way that term is viewed there is not how it\u2019s seen elsewhere.", "Yeah, this is a pattern I'm just seeing and have been trying to quantify to put into a PIP.  It's fairly subtle, so it rides the fence of acceptable or not, but it's there and, separate from this issue, I need to do something about it.", "It\u2019s funny because you just made shit up. Show me what men\u2019s rights sub I\u2019m on. Unless you\u2019re a liar.", "Yeah, for me there is nothing behind it.  But now I feel stupid for not considering all aspects of this. Like, really stupid.", "Infidelity forums are filled with this kind of story -- why risk becoming one of the majority?   More importantly, this particular woman is a known manipulator and low-key shit stirrer in the company.   She should have been dealt with a long time ago.", "Christ it\u2019s not that deep", "You should start writing up the work wife for being inappropriate and causing disharmony with other employees like you\u2019ve stated. She\u2019s trouble and needs to go.", "You aren\u2019t on any men\u2019s rights subs, but pretty much every single one of your comments is something one could expect to find in that sub. You fit the script for the men\u2019s rights crowd.\n\nEdit: you\u2019re definitely the type of guy that thinks \u201cmost\u201d rape accusations are false. I bet you like Andrew Tate, too. And let me guess- you don\u2019t think men should have to pay child support.", "That is a perfectly justified feeling", "You\u2019re really hung up on being right, aren\u2019t you?\n\nGuess what, in infidelity forums you\u2019re going to find infidelity.\n\nThese are the places that promote the nonsense that people who could possibly be attracted to one another can\u2019t be friends. Or that you should always trust your friends over your partners. Or that a small handful of people\u2019s experiences are the only acceptable \u2018truth\u2019.\n\nOP, like I would, viewed it as not worth addressing. That\u2019s our experiences speaking. OP\u2019s wife has an issue with it which is her experience speaking. OP is, as I would, addressing the issue because of how his wife feels.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t change the fact that berating him for not knowing implicitly that it\u2019s a problem when it\u2019s never cropped up between them before is not right. And there\u2019s also nothing rational about being humiliated by a stranger\u2019s behavior towards your partner when your partner has done nothing other than dismiss it as unimportant."]}
