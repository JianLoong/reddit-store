One of my favorite things we would do is sit in the park by my house and share my earphones while listing to our favorite songs. So when he left i would go do that by my self and i know there just earphones but they had so much sentimental value to me and him, and being able to listen to those same songs with the same earphones even without him there made me really happy. \n\nAnyway when this came up to me and literally just cut them up i almost started crying and got mad and he went and posted it to his tiktok account. All my friends said i was being over dramatic for reacting like i did but i just think that whole trend is stupid and inconsiderate even if they are giving you airpods after. I eventually got him to take the video down but it took a while and it was honestly so embarrassing to have that posted. My boyfriend agrees with me and is sad about it to but my friends and family still think i was just over reacting.\nAm i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671969127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuwqgh/aita_for_getting_mad_at_a_stranger_for_cutting_my/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How does it not occur to these people that you may not want AirPods?!", "NTA. \n\nThat's your property and you never agreed to let someone destroy it. End of story. Giving away airpods doesn't change that one bit. \n\nWho the hell starts these stupid trends anyways?", "NTA, it\u2019s property damage and illegal AND an asshole move. Take them to small claims if you want.", "NTA\nSomeone came into your space with a pair of scissors and destroyed your property to film your raw and unfiltered reaction.\n\nIt's a stupid trend honestly and I get why you are upset. You're entitled to feel how you feel.", "NTA\nfuck these people and their tiktok etc accounts", "NTA, it\u2019s shitty behaviour dressed-up as giving a gift for clicks", "As a bit of an audiophile you are definitely NTA, if someone cut my wired headphones cable I'd be arrested for assault.", "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not privy to stupid online pranks like this.

But honestly destruction of personal property is a very valid reason to get mad at someone doing something to you. \n\nEven if there was zero sentimental value, no one should be destroying someone else\u2019s headphones like that.", "About 10 yrs ago I got myself some high end in ear headphones for 300 dollars and I still got them.

Still, the stranger is the a#@hole here.", "NTA I have airpods but sometimes nothing can replace the feeling of using wired headphones, I know what it\u2019s like to have those sentiments, and to have some asshole damage them for some damn airpods to make a tik tok is just insulting, I would be very mad", "So a random stranger breaks your stuff, posts a video for everybody to laugh and you and your friends think that's just okay because they gave you a shitty replacement?

Those were *your* earbuds. They were your property, you liked them, and it was totally wrong for someone to damage them, even if they gave you something \"better\" afterward. I put \"better\" in quotations because not everyone likes airpods, and even if you did, that person still shouldn't go around damaging people's things. The fact that they held sentimental value for you and your boyfriend makes what that stranger did even worse.", "NTA I don\u2019t know about the legal system of your country, but I\u2019d file a complaint and sue them if they damaged my belongings and shamed me publicly on the Internet.", "NTA! That's awful! They have no right to do that even if they're replacing them. Those could be like the last gift someone got from a deceased loved one or something.
