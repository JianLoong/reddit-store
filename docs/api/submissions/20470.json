I do know that my BIL got screamed at by his new wife during pictures because he was being nice and bringing me to the front and to stand near my husband for this huge group photo. She wanted people where she wanted them and that excluded me being anywhere near the front near center. It was photo kind of from above so me being in front wasn't necessary (I'm 4'11\" for context).

Yeah, there was no prior discussion, but as someone who's been married for going on 11 years, I get that at some point, you can predict their feelings on a subject.
