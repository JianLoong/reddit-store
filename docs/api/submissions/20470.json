I wonder if my red hair or shorter arms have kept me out of wedding parties because it would take away from the esthetic. I do know that my BIL got screamed at by his new wife during pictures because he was being nice and bringing me to the front and to stand near my husband for this huge group photo. She wanted people where she wanted them and that excluded me being anywhere near the front near center. It was photo kind of from above so me being in front wasn't necessary (I'm 4'11\" for context).

Yeah, there was no prior discussion, but as someone who's been married for going on 11 years, I get that at some point, you can predict their feelings on a subject.

In the UK and other parts of Europe the bride and groom pay for the bridesmaids outfits.", "It depends on the financials and social circle involved, but generally yes it's the bridesmaid who pays for the dress itself. A considerate bride will generally keep in mind the financial situations of her bridesmaids when choosing and/or only request a color or present a range of options in style and price. Specific colors may be requested/required (for aesthetic reasons) but if you're going to require your bridesmaids to wear specific expensive outfits you should 1. make sure they can and are willing to afford it and 2. at the very least tell them that up front.\n\nThere are other traditions that help offset the cost of the dress, although they tend to fall by the wayside these days. Often they aren't talked about or obviously practiced, which means that people who are going for their big blowout wedding based on pictures and stories don't always know about them. They're meant to ensure the weight (financial or time) isn't too much for any of the bridesmaids, that they're compensated for what they're doing, and acts as a way for the brid(and groom!) to show how much they appreciate their friends/family.\n\nIn many circles, especially more traditional/well off ones, it's not uncommon for the bridesmaids to recive gifts, possibly in addition to accessories that are meant to be worn on the day (one wedding I helped with paid for all jewelry and shoes, as well as hair and make up for the bridesmaids and nice pocketwatches for the groomsmen. They also sent all of them to a music festival on the couple's dime. This was a very expensive wedding though, so most people wouldn't go quite that far) Specific outfits for things like the bachellorette party are also usually supposed to be on the bride's dime- which is why so many people go for custom t-shirts\n\nIf the wedding isn't local/isn't local for everyone, the bridal and groom parties usually should have their accomodation arranged for them for the period of the wedding (eg. the rehersal dinner, wedding, after party, etc), not necessarily the nicest possible accomoddation but something convenient for whatever they need to be doing. It is acceptable to ask them to pay for part of this if necessary, but generally any savings should be passed on to them and they shouldn't have to sort it out themselves (a lot of hotels and other places offer a set of rooms at reduced rates for weddings, there can be discounts for booking a large set together, etc. Generally, the wedding party should be included in such things)\n\nThere's a lot of selfishness these days, but also a lot of ignorance, I think? Like...if you have no experience with large weddings and are trying to make your 'dream' happen, you may well overstep, misjudge things, and be unaware of things you can and should be doing to make stuff easier on the wedding party. There's a lot of reasons for that, but the biggest is that people nowadays can see all these amazing weddings (ones that were probably put together by multiple professionals and bankrolled by someone with a great deal of disposable income) or hear stories about one wedding where the entire wedding party did amazing coreography down the aisle (because the bride and groom are professional dancers and so are all their closest friends) or the bridesmaids put together and paid for the absolute best bridal shower/bachellorette week (which was considered their wedding gift) and smash all those ideas together into their conception of what their wedding SHOULD be without really considering/understanding how much goes into that sort of thing and what they would need to do to facilitate it if they really want that. Also, if people are often comparing their own group of (most likely average) friends to the pinnacle of people's time/money/devotion/skill, they are always going to be disappointed", ">it's pretty common to expect the bridesmaids to pay for their dresses isn't it?\n\nThat very much depends on your culture!

They also both have good paying jobs. I was really surprised when I got a list of items I could give to the pair from the wedding planner. The list was full of household items the pair already owned or could easily pay for themselves. I bit the dust and gave them a frying pan from the list, even if I thought it was very stupid. Guess what: I never saw them using my frying pan, they used a different one. Why did I have to give it then? What did they do with it? Why were they even asking for household gifts? They already owned more than myself!", "Dang, when did \"morning of\" become a thing for gifts? That's ridiculous!", "Yeah... \"I'd love for you to be my bridesmaid! Here's a \u00a31000 bill for your dress.\" would be asking a lot!", "I'm Welsh, but was a bridesmaid for a close friend in the US. She was also from the UK, and paid for her bridesmaid's outfits, as that was normal to her. Her fianc\u00e9's family were appalled!", "I was a bridesmaid in the NE US in the 90s, well before the Kardashians, and paid for my own dress and have never heard of brides doing so. That said, it strikes me as a very nice and appropriate thing for a bride to do if the dress really isn\u2019t going to be worn again. (Mine could have been worn again if I went to the sort of event where it would be appropriate, but I don\u2019t.)", "It has always been tradition for bridesmaids to pay for their dresses in America.

I also didn\u2019t want to saddle them with paying for a shower or a bachelorette extravaganza so I chose not to have either. I realize I\u2019m in the minority but maybe I shouldn\u2019t be.

Or a mix of both most often. Usually, the bridal shower and any planning related events happen spaced out, possibly also the bachelorette, and then the rehersal dinner and wedding happen back to back. Weddings are and have always been a time committment, but people do blow them way out of proportion at times.\n\nIn addition to the wedding itself there is: a bachelorette party (and bachelor party ofc), a rehersal dinner, and possibly a bridal shower. There may also be other things like bridal/bridesmaid dress shopping, cake tastings, etc. but you generally aren't required to attend them, just invited to help.\n\nI do agree with your description of the bachelorette party, and any coordination for them should be basic or provided by the organizer who is usually the MoH (eg. 'wear blue' or giving out graphic t-shirts) It's reasonable to tell your friends that you want to coordinate/wear cute shirts, and would also be reasonable to have them dress up a bit if you're going somewhere particularily nice, but not to specifically control what they wear/expect them to acquire a new wardrobe. Bachelorette parties are typically only one night, although some people do 'long weekend' style ones- in which case bridesmaids who can attend should be advised what sort of events there are to aid them in packing (the last thing you want is to end up in Hawaii and only then find out you need a formal evening gown) but not to control what they wear directly. A week of bachelorette activities is only reasonable if it's not compulsory and the bride/MoH is paying for all/most of it or have at least talked about it extensively with the bridesmaids.\n\nOn the other hand, rehersal dinners are in no way *supposed* to be casual. They can be, if the wedding is casual, but the reason they are called 'rehersals' is because they are often formal events. Sometimes you do literally reherse some aspects of the wedding before/during them. They have always been that, and have actually gotten less formal in many circles (or the term has been applied to any pre-wedding party that includes food lol). You generally do have a dress code for rehersal dinners. Expecting a specific outfit is unreasonable, but expecting a quality of outfit is normal and fine so long as that's communicated- the same way that guests at any event can be told \"it's black tie\" and expected to conform, but saying \"wear exactly this shade of navy blue\" would be obviously unreasonable.\n\nI understand the annoyance/judegment that comes with a bunch of people acting wildly unreasonable, but I think it's important not to overcorrect: weddings *aren't* normal events. Yes that's partially due to societal bs, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a rare/important event. Everyone should be sensible while planning and do so according to their means/ability, but that doesn't mean that people shouldn't get to have nice things, feel special, etc. The problem comes when people decide that the only way they can feel special enough is if the entire world bows down to their whims, not from people just wanting to have nice things.", "According to one interpretation, all this hoo-ha about weddings functionally supplants courtship rituals.", "I've heard of brides asking engaged or married bridesmaids not to wear their engagement rings.", "It\u2019s also the sort of thing that will end up a trivially important footnote from the wedding soon enough afterwards anyway.", "Every other one I've been to.

The last straw was his mother throwing a huge fit because we didn\u2019t want the same island kitchen and she over rode our decisions even though we were paying for everything and it was our house. Sorry for the trauma dump. All that to say I can relate and I\u2019m sorry \ud83e\udd23", "I was in family photos, so it wasn't about snubbing me. She just had a vision for that photo. Honestly, I'm a people pleaser so from her first objection (before she had the outburst) I was like \"I'm totally cool being in the back, but my BIL insisted. I ended up a bit embarrassed (and everything emotion in my mom's side of family comes out our eyes, but was doing my best to not let one tear drop). My husband's aunt motioned me over and was like, \"you can stand with us.\" And was very sweet. \n\nI hold a grudge to this day about the whole thing, but that was because of other factors. Destination wedding, had promised to help us financially (we're the lowest income part of the family. Husband hasn't worked since 2015 due to disability), then reneged on that. It was also to soften the blow of picking the week and day they did (out of 365/52) that coincided with a date that had been important to us for 2 years and that we would be leaving behind that important thing. I'm trying to be vague in case they Reddit, but I don't think I'm succeeding.", "Down to the pajamas. Do they expect cameras in the rooms? What else, bras and panties too? \n\nI could get a shirt or two and one formal outfit (one pair of matching pants if necessary). Not an entire wardrobe. If you want me to wear fifteen different outfits you better be buying, I won't wear those clothes again!", "I remember throwing out the shoes the bride made me get between the ceremony and the reception the last time I was a bridesmaid. The dress is in my closet still because I have no idea what to do with it. It was ridiculously expensive and not an \"average\" size that a thrift store would typically carry. I love the idea of donating it to someone for prom. I'll look into that!", "I don't think it is fair at all. In most of the world is is extremely gauche have the bridesmaids pay for their own dresses. I don't know how this became the standard in the US."]}
