Just because you live together does not mean you spend every waking moment together. Having your own hobby is a good thing, and she should find a hobby or something she also enjoys apart from you as it\u2019s the foundation for a healthy relationship. \nI personally value the time my husband goes to the gym or on a bike ride, and even miss him while he\u2019s gone. The time apart makes us appreciate each other more and value & enjoy our time together.", "NTA - be careful. It\u2019s definitely an adjustment moving in with someone and learning how to have \u201ctogether time\u201d and your own \u201csolo time\u201d. You should be allowed to have hobbies and your partner should have hobbies. My husband plays pickle ball 3x a week for a couple hours. I don\u2019t usually go because I prefer going to the gym.

Second, think about that relationship again.", "NTA. Her insisting you spend every hour of every weekend with her is toxic. This is one relationship that's just not worth salvaging. I suggest you dump her.", "Ride that bike far away from her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA ~ put the brakes on hard/fast. A relationship between two people doesn\u2019t mean doing everything together. Trust me.

You are allowed to have hobbies outside of your relationship.  Sounds like she\u2019s gaslighting you to get what she wants.  Are you sure you want to move in with her?", "Nta. She needs to find her own hobbies.

There is nothing \"gaslighting\" about enjoying your own physical hobby alone. Run/bike away...", "100% NTA - You need alone time 3 hours a week is a tiny ask. \n\nHer insisting you stop is really weird. It would be one thing if her reasons were fear of you getting hurt.

How are chores and finances divided, where will you be spending holidays, what are your expectations about friends of the opposite sex, will you have rules about family and friends calling before they come over or are they good to just drop by etc. If you sit down to talk about some of these things, especially the time alone issue, I suggest you delay living together and do a couples therapy appointment to help you further negotiate or assist you in realizing that you are not compatible.", "NTA, but you should break up. If she can't cope with you spending three hours out of the weekend apart from her, and attacks you when you try, this relationship is doomed.", "NTA. I do this too as well as play D&D most Sundays for about 4 hours a session. It\u2019s healthy to have your own interests in a relationship as well as doing things together.", "NTA. \n\nWhat does she do when you go to work? Hang out with friends? Go to school? Go on a work trip?\n\nAll the red flags.", "NTA do not move in with her! Bike away!", "NTA. Spending and hour and a half biking on 2 weekend days is not unreasonable at all. My wife and I do a lot of things together but we often pursue individual interests separately. I also like to cycle and my wife does not. \n\nI would rethink moving in.", "NTA - It\u2019s normal and healthy for couples to have interests they share and interests they enjoy independently. She is the one gaslighting and manipulating - don\u2019t go through with the move.", "People really need to stop thinking they have to do everything with their SO. This how people lose their identity and sense of self. She's also accusing you of gaslighting when she doesn't even recognize the fact that she's doing it.", "Do not move in with her, she will make your life hell", "NTA\n\nIn fact - stick to your guns (so to speak). As soon as you start hedging on your own interests in favor of, frankly, what SHE thinks you SHOULD do... it's over.\n\nI speak from experience.\n\nIn fact - as other redditors have mentioned. Maybe it needs to be over anyway.", "Keep riding and delay the move. If anyone attempts to talk you out of something you are passionate about that's healthy and  within reason, then they are more interested in what they want than what makes you feel good and healthy. This needs to be resolved and if she can't understand your perspective and be supportive now, she might not ever. A good way to build resentment.", "Maybe the entire relationship too...\ud83d\ude10", "It has to do something with gaslighting, but not from OP\u2018s side lol", "100. As long as OP isn\u2019t failing to mention that he refuses to make any other plans that get in the way of these bike rides. We all have to make sacrifices, but if the SO really wants bike rides to come to a full stop.. gtfo", "Yes! I love my husband very much but I don't want to go on every single fishing jaunt, especially since he has buddies who are much more excited to take part. He can take the boat out for the day, I'll play Euro Trick Simulator, and in the evening he can tell me about his fish between me talking about how I blew past a police cordon on the highway.", ">\tSame! (I mean, not with your wife, she\u2019s busy with you.)\n\nYou got 4 hours per weekend!", "Well put", "NTA\n\nRe-think moving in together. \n\nYou both clearly have different ideas about what you want from this new phase of your relationship.\n\nShe also sounds very controlling.", "NTA I\u2019d definitely wait to move in with her this is actually insanity your, your own person and you have hobbies ass all couples do it\u2019s completely normal to spend 1-3 hours away from you partner.", "NTA. Also, her approach to this is a box FULL of red flags \ud83d\udea9 be careful", "Seriously, don\u2019t move in with her. It\u2019s not about a bike, it\u2019s she doesn\u2019t understand how a healthy relationship works on a very fundamental level. \nYour life will be miserable in many ways you can\u2019t even predict right now. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You should NOT move in with her! She is being WAY too controlling to begrudge you your bike rides on the weekends. It's a physically and mentally healthy thing for you to do after the work week,and people who insist that SOs should be constantly stuck up each other's ass 24/7 are not healthy. Ugh. I would actually re evaluate the whole relationship if she is this way. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you wanting a hour and a half each day on the weekend to take care of your physical and mental health. If she really loved you,she would want you to do that instead of just being \" me me me me\" all the time. Someone who expects you to be a conjoined twin to them are bad bad news. You will be miserable if you move in with her. Wanting an hour and a half to yourself each day,whether it be reading,exercising ,whatever is HEALTHY in a good relationship. It doesn't mean you want to be single forever at all. It just means you are not a clingy , insecure person.", "NTA DONT move in with old girl! Y\u2019all got some shit to work out first. This won\u2019t be sustainable and will breed resentment and frustration", "EHEM, my boyfriend loves and I mean LOVES to bike ride. I personally can't keep up with him hehe but we do go occasionally. He will go on bike rides for 3 hours and I sit at home doing my own thing example: playing my video games, crocheting, watching my favorite show and my favorite thing of all TAKING A NAP! Here is the thing you need to tell your girlfriend. If you think that yall are going to live with eachother and be shoved up eachothers butts every 5 seconds and not wanting to do your own thing. Then you are poorly mistaken, you will both quite litterally get angry. I mean this in the kindest of hearts. But you are NTA.", "Run. She needs therapy. And you may too. Sending you the best!! You're definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nEveryone NEEDS your own time and your own interests.\nThis kind of behavior of your girlfriend shows a red flag for controlling behavior. She wants you to abandon everything for her, this way she will be your everything and later in life if you loose her you will lose yourself.\n\nDon't let her win", "She could just learn how to ride a bike. Sure, she wouldn't be able to take hour long rides with you right away, but she's not even bothering to take baby steps in your direction right now. \n\nThis is going to be a recurring theme in your relationship, and if you're set on moving in with her you should keep that in mind.", "Nta she is showing huge red flags and I agree I think you should be thinking twice about this relationship not just moving in with her it's totally healthy and normal to enjoy doing thing s solo while being in a relationship sounds like she will drive a wedge between you and your family once you move in", "Any partner that wants you to give up exercise and enjoyment for them is not a good partner. Don\u2019t give it up\u2026.and maybe don\u2019t move in.", "I cycle for a couple hours every Saturday and Sunday. My husband potters in the garden or makes jewellery or does whatever he wants. Then we spend the afternoons and evenings together. You're still your own person even when in a relationship. Don't give up part of yourself to please someone else because you'll resent them.", "Biking is good for your health. Dealing with a control-freak of a partner isn\u2019t. Y\u2019all need some counseling or to move on from each other. NTA", "This is a big red flag my dude. I\u2019d reconsider a relationship with someone who didn\u2019t value personal time and space.\n\nSorry, edit: Definitely NTA", "Yeeeaaaah you should 100% have interests and activities you do separately when in a relationship. This is very weird for her to request imo. Like unless ur cheating on her instead of riding your bike I really don\u2019t see how that would be a bad thing? NTA.", "NTA and she is showing herself to be controlling and vindictive. I would not move in and contemplate why you should stay", "NTA.\n\nSimilar thing happened to me. It won't get better. Its not healthy to have to do everything together. You need some time to yourself and time with friends besides your gf. If she won't accept that, you're in for a long road ahead of you.", "NTA.  Who's gaslighting who? There is nothing wrong with riding your bike for a couple of hours on weekends.  Spending time together is important, yes but spending every waking moment together is unhealthy.  I'm sure she does things that don't involve you as well.  You should really rethink this move and relationship.", "NTA As long as you're spending an equal amount of time doing things with her on the weekends she shouldn't be complaining about giving you this one hobby of yours.  If you're not devoting at least that much time if not more to your relationship then I could understand where she might be complaining. It's all about balance.", "Well at least she is making it easy for you to decide not to move in together. \n\nNTA, but seriously do yourself a favor and do not move in with her. \n\nFirst, because it is absolutely okay to have individual hobbies, and I think the best relationships last when the couple do have ways to spend time alone or with others like having a group of friends that go out, going to the gym, etc. When you move in with someone, you do not have to perfectly align to only do things together, and the fact that she thinks that is very alarming. \n\nBut what is more alarming is that when you disagree with her, she calls you a gaslighter and you must want to be single, so now you know that she doesn't know the definition of words, she will manipulate you when she doesn't get what she wants, and she will take any disagreement to the extreme. Ya, not someone to live with, so get on your bike and ride away.", "NTA\n\nI had a friend with a wife like your girlfriend. He loved cycling, but his wife decided he shouldn't do it. She \"generously\" allows him a short bike ride once a year on his birthday. This sounds like where your relationship is headed.", "Eeek open your eyes before its too late", "NTA. Postpone the move. Everyone should want solo time to do their own thing.", "NTA - It\u2019s not as though you are biking for hours on end. People need to have some alone time. Do not give up an activity that is good for your mental and physical wellbeing.  This is not a reasonable expectation.", "BIG RED FLAG. \ud83d\udea9\n\nI was with an abuser for a decade. They start off small and will slowly start to control everything you do.\n\nMy abuser didn\u2019t want me wearing pink nail polish, didn\u2019t want me wearing certain clothes, I wasn\u2019t allowed to spend money without permission, I couldn\u2019t hanging out with my friends, he even got jealous of the time I would spend with elderly family members because I was away from him.\nI remember vividly being screamed at because I bought the wrong type of water. Life was hell.\n\nPLEASE take this as a warning sign. Don\u2019t move in with this women and rethink this relationship.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable for you to want to go for a bike ride alone.", "NTA. Don't move in, that's not a reasonable ask. \n \n\nIf my partner wanted to go off and do his ride for 1.5hr each day on the weekend, I'd think 'great! I'll crank my music, watch the shows I want, etc.' I'd do the stuff I like that he doesn't in that timeframe as well. \n\nAlone time is important and healthy in a relationship.", "NTA.\n\nRed flags all around, my man. \n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\n\nHave said it before, will say it again:  \"The pillars of the temple stand apart.\"  -  Kahlil Gibran\n\nIt is healthy for you both to have solo interests and hobbies as well as shared ones.", "I went to a red flag convention this weekend. \n\nKind of looked something like this. \n\nNTA", "NTA Please consider putting a pause on moving in together. She has a warped idea of what a healthy relationship looks like.", "Just because you will live with her does NOT mean you have to spend all your time with her. \nDuring this time if me\u2026 I would clean the house in peace with music on or do errands or take up a hobby of my own. Alone time is good to everyone.", "NTA, couples should not do every single thing together.  Doesn't she have any of her own interests?  This would be a red flag for me; controlling behavior over something that you use for health and fitness is not a good thing.", "NTA - definitely.\n\nI've been married for almost 30 years and we have many different interests. That keeps things interesting as it gives us things to talk about. It also meets our own needs. He's a musician and I'm an artist. He would go nuts without his music and I'd go nuts without my art. We understand that about each other and care enough about each other to want that for them. \n\nNow here's where you can offer a compromise to see if this relationship is worth it. Offer to teach her to ride a bike and see how she responds.\n\nIronically, this is kind of how my dh and I got together. He thought I was cute and wanted to hang out with me but I was the one going on super long bike rides. So he bought himself a bike and started riding with me. He didn't ask me to stop doing what I loved, but decided to join me in that. We still ride together as well as kayak and hike.", "Please think very hard. This does not sound like its going to be a healthy relationship for you.", "I can attest to this. A similar situation happened to me, and it lead to me having no friends besides hers for probably 5-6 years. It's not healthy.", "If it\u2019s as simple as that I obviously agree. Color me skeptical of someone that provides absolutely no detail of how this hobby is affecting his partners life or how this hard and fast 1.5 hours a weekend day is implemented. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as it sounds, maybe he\u2019s being unreasonable. If he\u2019s already doing all the stuff in my post and being considerate of his partner then good for him.", "Yep. The GF is projecting so hard we can all see it Miles away.", "NTA. If she's so bothered, can she learn to ride a bike of her own?", "NTA. You're talking 3h a week for the purposes of your own mental health. It's not a big ask. I love spending time with my husband, but we have our own hobbies as well as those things we like to do together. Having time on your own is healthy and it also gives each of you something else to talk about, rather than constantly being in each other's pocket. \n\nI agree with several other comments that this could be a warning sign, but I'd suggest sensitive conversation (and possibly therapy) to work out why she is asking you to forfeit this activity, before making any big decisions. That said, I do think you need to understand why she's asking you to do this before moving in together.", "NTA my husband went for a 3 hour bike ride yesterday while I visited with a friend. It\u2019s healthy to have separate hobbies.", "NTA, and you shouldn't move in with her. That's very clingy and manipulative behavior, and therefore a huge red flag. It's obviously important for couples to also have separate interests, and her trying to make you give up something you enjoy bc she can't is super controlling. \n\nFor real, reconsider the move.", "Dude do you even wanna date somebody like this?\n\nNta. Couples are allowed and should have hobbies separate from each other.", "NTA and definitely rethink moving in. She doesn\u2019t sound stable or considerate.", "NTA. My ex boyfriend was like this (wanted to be together 24/7, if we were not together it was constant calling and messaging) - and it was suffocating. Also lost all my social life because of that guy. Please don't make the same mistake I did, it will take a toll on you if you let her control you.", "NTA. \nMy boyfriend loves to ride his bicycle and often goes to 15-50km rides on the weekends. I love to be alone those times and do my own thing. Couples need to have their own hobbies, at least for us. I would go mental if we did everything together.", "NTA\u2014huge red flag. she sounds like she\u2019s gonna be weirdly paranoid and jealous of anything you do not with her", "NTA and pretty telling that shes not compromising over this just telling you to give it up. if she doesn't like being alone while your out bikeriding whats stopping her from learning how to ride a bike so it can be something you do together. you shouldnt have to give  up something you enjoy just because you're moving in together", "Does she get mad at you when you shit too? NTA", "NTA. You are not responsible for her entertainment. She needs to find her own hobbies.", "NTA and this is one of the dumbest and most clingy things I\u2019ve heard from a SO.  My husband is a massive cycling \ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2640\ufe0f enthusiast.  For years from dating to marrying (we just had our 25th anniversary) he would cycle for 4 hours every Saturday and sometimes a few hours Sunday.  He started super early so was home by or before noon.  This gave me alone time for whatever I wanted to do - and it was his main form of exercise.  He always adjusted or canceled his cycling if we had a social commitment or I just wanted him with me to go to breakfast or brunch.  And he definitely altered it once our daughter was born.  \n\nRelationships are compromise and each person should be allowed leeway to enjoy a hobby their partner isn\u2019t into.

Good luck!", "At first I was thinking you were going to be an asshole for not spending quality time with your partner, but it doesn't sound like you have a partner.

Do not move in with her. NTA", "NTA. Me and my partner have hobbies we enjoy together, we also have hobbies we enjoy apart. I\u2019m interested in her hobbies and she is interested in mine. But she\u2019s not about to tell me I can\u2019t go down the shed to work on my railway as in her own words it gets me out of her hair for a couple of hours. \n\nMy BIL and SIL are the complete opposite. His not allowed to move their entire free time is spent around what she wants. He used to do warhammer and DND, now his not allowed to do either as it takes him away from her. \n\nHonestly run mate, keep running and when you think you\u2019ve run far enough run away some more.", "NTA.  She sounds controlling.  I do plenty of activities without my S.O.  Swimming and hiking aren't anything he is interestd in doing.  We do have joint hobbies and interests, but I feel it's important to exercise for health reasons.  Why would your gf want to deny you a healthy activity?  You're not out gambling and going to strip clubs. Why can't she grab coffee with a friend or do something else why you are out?  Just because you are going to live together doesn't mean you need to be surgically attached at the hip.

You need to work from home bc she can't trust people at your job. Then you wake up strapped to a bed and tye main character in a horror movie. Nope right out of there", "Her reasoning makes her TA. As for you, it depends if you can be flexible on occasions or if it absolutely has to be every single saturday and sunday with everything else revolving around it.
