There is not a thing in the world wrong with you having this interest and hobby. You would be making a serious mistake to move in with this girl right now.

Just because you live together does not mean you spend every waking moment together. Having your own hobby is a good thing, and she should find a hobby or something she also enjoys apart from you as it\u2019s the foundation for a healthy relationship. \nI personally value the time my husband goes to the gym or on a bike ride, and even miss him while he\u2019s gone. The time apart makes us appreciate each other more and value & enjoy our time together.", "NTA - be careful. It\u2019s definitely an adjustment moving in with someone and learning how to have \u201ctogether time\u201d and your own \u201csolo time\u201d. You should be allowed to have hobbies and your partner should have hobbies. My husband plays pickle ball 3x a week for a couple hours. I don\u2019t usually go because I prefer going to the gym.

Second, think about that relationship again.", "NTA. Her insisting you spend every hour of every weekend with her is toxic. This is one relationship that's just not worth salvaging. I suggest you dump her.", "Ride that bike far away from her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA ~ put the brakes on hard/fast. A relationship between two people doesn\u2019t mean doing everything together. Trust me.

You are allowed to have hobbies outside of your relationship.  Sounds like she\u2019s gaslighting you to get what she wants.  Are you sure you want to move in with her?", "Nta. She needs to find her own hobbies.

This girl sounds controlling as hell.", "NTA and I don't think you really want to move in with someone this controlling, do you? There is nothing \"gaslighting\" about enjoying your own physical hobby alone. Run/bike away...", "100% NTA - You need alone time 3 hours a week is a tiny ask. \n\nHer insisting you stop is really weird. It would be one thing if her reasons were fear of you getting hurt.

Just today my hubby was out from before dawn to full dark ice fishing with his friends. \n\nYour girlfriend's take on this is very clingy and not a good thing at all. Healthy relationships I have seen generally don't involve the partners being together 24/7. \n\nDon't move in with her.", "NTA. See if she'll go to couples counseling before moving in.", "op=NTA\n\nbeing involved with another person does not mean they get you 24/7.\n\nYou have a right to time for yourself.  \n\nI hope you are doing these in morning or something rather than middle of the day, because that does make it harder to 'make plans\" with someone if you have to stop for 90 minutes. (Basing this on people more often having m-f jobs, her then wanting to make plans on weekend since that appears to be your free time).\n\nPS her trying to guilt you with relationship \"buzzwords\" is a very unattractive(and unhealthy) way to deal with conflict.

Dad loves to ride. They tried over and over but she insisted. When daughter went to college, it was a huge campus and she realized riding a bike would make life easier. She had a friend teach her. The next time she came home she was angry at her parents that they didn\u2019t MAKE her learn earlier because now she loves it.", "NTA, but I do wonder if there isn't a little bit more going on here and perhaps some compromises that could be made? For instance, are your bike rides stopping you two from doing other things she want to do together on the weekends? Like going for brunch or a farmers market. Or some type of all day activitie? If that is the case I could see a compromise being needed. But if that's not an issues at all, then yeah seriously consider the longevity of this relationship.

If he can\u2019t skip \u2014 maybe that\u2019s a problem for them as a couple. Exercise is extremely important to both my partner and me but it would bug me if he had to spend 1.5 hours working out alone, every single weekend day, without fail.
