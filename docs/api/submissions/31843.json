She keeps coming into my room at night (we\u2019re housemates) waking me up to cry about how sore it is and how hungry she is. Every time I tell her to go to the dentist, but she keeps making excuses saying she can\u2019t afford it and work is more important. We work for our parents who keep telling her they\u2019ll pay for it and give her the time off, and Claire has never been afraid of the dentist or had issues making her own appointments for stuff so I have idea why she\u2019s being like this.\n\nI\u2019m one of those people who needs my solid 8 hours and I have a lot of trouble falling asleep so I\u2019m losing a lot of sleep because of this and it\u2019s impacting my work and life in general. A few friends have called me out on being godawful to be around right now and my boyfriend understands I\u2019m not intentionally being horrible, but he doesn\u2019t want to be around me right now.\n\nLast night Claire woke me up after midnight and I told her I was done with this problem of own creation and it impacting my life. She started with the money and work excuses and I called bullshit, mum and dad have said over and over they\u2019ll pay for it and give her the time off, and we can get by without her for a day or two. She then called me a bitch and said she needs sympathy and I said no, she needs to put on her big girl panties and make an appointment with the dentist ASAP or I\u2019d break the lease and move out. She said I can\u2019t abandon her and she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the rent on her own and I said tough, dentist or I move out, those are her options.\n\nShe went back to her room crying, but she\u2019s been avoiding me at work and she must talked to mum and told her what I said because mum chewed me out this morning when I got to work saying what I said to Claire wasn\u2019t fair. I told mum she\u2019s welcome to swap houses with me and be woken up nearly every night to deal with Claire and her martyr complex, but we had to leave it at that because she got a phone call.\n\nI\u2019ve been stewing on it all day and even though it worked and Claire made a dentist appointment for tomorrow, I think mum may be right that I went too far.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit like 2 mins after I made the post: I forgot to mention I have told Claire to stop waking me up but she keeps doing it. I\u2019m so tired, guys\u2026\n\nEdit 2: our rental doesn\u2019t have locks on any internal doors except the bathrooms and I can\u2019t install one without the landlord\u2019s permission or I\u2019d lose my bond. Anyway, I tried sticking a doorstop under the door and she just knocked until I woke up and answered.

At this point, I'm thinking you or one of your parents should just make her the appointment and drag her there if you have to. It sounds like anxiety or something is stopping her, and continuing to ignore the problem is likely to make it worse.

She could have taken pain meds etc. She is an adult. She should have just made an appointment without you needing to threaten her. She sounds immature.", "NTA.  This dental situation isn\u2019t going to resolve itself on its own she doesn\u2019t take action. You also can\u2019t keep being woken up by her her complaints, and there\u2019s clearly nothing you can do to ease her physical pain.  She is an adult, and needs to take steps to care for herself.", "nta - it finally got the message across. toothache can turn lethal - they should not be left untreated.", "NTA, I shattered a tooth a few years ago and couldn't afford to fix it for nearly a month. The pain is indescribable, some nights I considered suicide to make it stop. Your sister needs to get her shit together and see a dentist before the problem gets even worse.

She made the decision to not act like an adult and seem to think she can make you pay for it.\nHonestly I\u2019d actually look into moving anyway, after the lease is up, because the level of dependency she shows and the fact that your mother support that behavior are alarming.", "NTA, tooth problems can be fatal if left untreated for too long, but I do wonder if this reluctance is from anxiety which isn\u2019t uncommon.\n\nI put off going to the dentist for a couple years, was afraid of the pain of the cleaning because my gums were so inflamed. This was despite going to the dentist every 2 weeks for braces adjustment without any major issues. \n\nEventually it got to the point where I was risking losing my teeth, so I did go. I was shaking and crying in the chair even with the numbing needles removing all the pain (eventually). Was bizarre suddenly being really scared. I\u2019m still not the biggest fan of going, but my teeth are almost back to full health.", "NTA.  You were accommodating and needed a resolution to this issue.  I understand how terrible it can be not getting enough sleep and how annoying it can be to be woken up night after night for a fixable reason.  Hope she actually goes to the dentist.", "NTA, but honestly I'd look at other apartments anyways...", "You can buy a hotel lock (or travel lock) on Amazon\u2026 it won\u2019t damage the door but it will keep your sister out. \n\nNTA \n\nI sympathize with your sister.. but she needs to get this done and fixed because the more you wait the worse it gets.  Maybe she can find a dentist that uses gas if she is afraid \n\nI had never had a problem with a dentist until I had a really bad one\u2026 \n\nEver since I feel like I\u2019m about to have a heart attack when I sit on their chair.", "Nta is this is an infection it can get really really worst even death threatening and Im not even exaggerating. This happened to my step sister a couple of years ago. She had a tooth infection she didnt go to see a doctor soon enough and the infection move to other parts. She was hospitalized for like a month. We were all scared af.", "NTA", "NTA - Why is she even waking you up? If she's hungry and/or in pain, then she has the means to at least fix those things. I get that she needs sympathy and comfort, but, holy shit, she needs to book an appointment with the dentist and leave you alone.", "NTA but have you considered that she may be scared of dentists? I'm 40+ yo guy who gets cold sweats just sitting in the waiting room and has to be given a sedative if they are using the drill", "NTA - but you need to move out anyway. \n\nThe problem here is not the dentist or the tooth-ache, the problem is your sister's attitude to your needs. She feels entitled to wake you up. And while in some instances that might make sense, she also feels she is entitled to wake you up when it does not make sense. This problem is not going to go away. There is no dentist that I know of that can effectively treat or extract entitlement. Start planning your escape.", "NTA and at this point, if I'm not sleeping, she ain't either, wake her the fuck up everyday till she goes to the dentist, say you are a tooth fairy and you want her tooth and won't stop till she gets it looked at", "NTA, but make sure you've got another place lined up for after this lease ends. Your sister is incredibly inconsiderate and cannot be trusted to respect your peace and privacy.  \nFrankly, I'm amazed you lasted as long as you did because the *first* night my sibling decided to wake me up for something that is entirely not-my-problem I would have torn him a new rear end so bad he'd never interrupt my sleep for anything short of the house burning down again.", "She\u2019s made an appointment now that I made my threat, she\u2019s going to the dentist tomorrow.", "My rule of thumb is that if someone does nothing to help themselves then I can\u2019t be bothered to offer sympathy and support.

Lock your bedroom door so she can\u2019t get in and bother you. You can even hang a sign that says \u201cgo to the dentist, I can\u2019t help you. Good night\u201d.", "She\u2019s made an appointment for tomorrow and dad has said he will drive her himself to make sure she goes. He\u2019s sick of her complaining at work as well.", "Rental doesn\u2019t have locks and I can\u2019t install one without landlords permission or may lose my bond. Either way, I out a doorstop under my door and she just knocked, waking me up, until I answered.", "Is that your poor attempt at a joke or does dumb stuff just come out of your mouth very easily?", "She hasn\u2019t been scared in the past, even when she had her wisdom teeth removed and she\u2019s been plenty of times since then. We\u2019ve all been going to the same dentist since we were kids so we know our dentist pretty well.", "We\u2019ve been housemates for 2 years and this is the first time something like this has happened. Before now we\u2019ve never had an issue.", "NTA and good to know she is sorting her issue with the dentist. Give us an update", "You're nicer than me.  I would have pulled out a pair of pliers and told her I'd take care of the tooth extraction myself.", "You said she has an appointment, but if for whatever reason she doesn\u2019t go last minute can you stay at your boyfriend\u2019s?

Rinse and repeat.", "NTA. Put a doorstop and use noise cancelling headphones/ear plugs/etc to block her out.", "Look up travel locks for hotel on Amazon, they work", "In the future, bring out the cranky rage right out the gate. Your inconsiderate sister kept this up as long as she did because you humoured her. Getting a face-full of fury instead of sympathy every time she bothers you after bedtime may well be the only way to train her not to knock after-hours.", "Fair enough, definitely NTA then", "A bad infection in your mouth can kill you. The fix after 2 weeks will be more extensive/expensive than 2 weeks ago. However she will come back from the dentist tomorrow feeling better."]}
