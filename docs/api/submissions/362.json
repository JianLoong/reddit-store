It got so much worse after my grandmother moved out last year, to the point where she\u2019s drained my finances to the bone and has effectively prevented me from saving up so I can pay off a debt from a previous apartment she also caused (for backstory on that, she would also mooch off my grandma to help pay rent on her own place when I was living with said grandmother, which caused her to get evicted and have a 3500.00 debt slapped on us). After this last time she borrowed, I gently reminded her \u201chey, you said you were gonna start paying me back today\u201d. She absolutely lost her shit and called me ungrateful, selfish, spoiled, and that I \u201cneeded to have more patience\u201d. She then took money out of some jar, threw it at my face and called me a selfish piece of shit.
