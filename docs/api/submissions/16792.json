As much as I understand your position, you're not here to change the grown up people and teach them to \"behave\". Their hypocrisy is on them. \n\nIf I were you, I'd emphasize the part where they have to get you envolved against your will and make it clear for them that it's uncomfortable and stressful for you. But as an Autistic person myself, I can see myself stepping on the same rake repeatedly and calling people out. Do you really think they have such low self-awareness that they don't understand what they're doing? Your pointing it out is like pointing out the spots on a teenager's face and will only cause resentment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. both your mom and mil sound exhausting.", "Based on the information provided, it doesn't seem like you are the asshole for calling out your MIL's and your mother's hypocrisy. It is understandable that you would want to put an end to the bickering between the two and to make them see that they both did the same thing for their children. It is also understandable that you might have felt hurt by their criticism of you and your brother-in-law for wanting to work in the field you studied in. However, it is important to communicate your feelings in a constructive manner, rather than using their help against them to prove a point. Perhaps, you could try talking to them again and explain why their criticism is hurtful to you and ask them to stop.", "NTA Your observations are correct.  However I'm guessing you're not going to get very far if you continue to try and bring up the topic.  I'm guessing that because they each think the other is wrong for \"babying\" their adult child, they don't want it pointed out they did the same thing (I don't think they're actually babying either of you). But they don't see it the same when it's their own child, because their in the middle of the situation.  \n\nSo no, your observations are not wrong.  But it's probably not worth your efforts to try and make them see what they don't want to see.", "NTA.
