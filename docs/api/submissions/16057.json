When I came down recently her housemates asked my girlfriend if it would be okay if I didn\u2019t go in the kitchen as much and wouldn\u2019t go in when they are cooking. They also said they sometimes wait until me and my gf are done in the kitchen before they use it as they find it uncomfortable and awkward.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both agreed it\u2019s fine and is okay. However, a couple days later, I wouldn\u2019t go into the kitchen if I heard the housemates in there and would wait but my gf told me to just go. Additionally, I once tried to leave the kitchen as I didn\u2019t have anymore cooking to do incase the house mates were gonna come down and my gf got annoyed. I was just trying to avoid contact as I don\u2019t want the housemates to feel awkward \n\nI still do the washing up late at night and will be with my gf sometimes when she cooks so it\u2019s not about me finding an excuse to be lazy. \n\nAnyway, I expressed how I can\u2019t go in the kitchen as much and I am trying to avoid them but my girlfriend thinks I am putting them on a pedestal and I am ignoring what she wants (us in the kitchen more)\n\nWe argued back and forth and I was just explaining how I don\u2019t want anyone to feel awkward and our time in the kitchen is a fraction of the day so it won\u2019t matter. \n\nShe refused to talk to me for a while and now kicked me out the house, I\u2019ve just been sat in my car with only my phone for hours.\n\n\nEdit: as people asked why the kitchen was a source of conflict:\n\nTo get to the toilet you have to go through the kitchen (weird house build), so I would usually just wait if I needed it for the other girls to leave the kitchen and my girlfriend didn\u2019t like that I would wait", "created_utc": 1682859978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133pbj9/aita_for_not_prioritising_my_girlfriend/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're being mindful of her roommates and thus making sure her living situation isn't jeopardized by your behavior. She may not care about them, but you care about whether or not they will retaliate against her if you're not mindful of their comfort as well.", "NTA   \nYou're a guest there, you're not on the lease and you're not paying rent, it is your obligation to respect the boundaries of all people there. Good for you OP on that.   \nYour gf is weird, does she not think of the consequences of potential conflict with her roommates ? She lives with 4 women, they may not feel comfortable with a complete stranger in their home, and may not feel comfortable sharing space with a man. While I think it is a bit weird for the kitchen to be a place of peculiarity, it is totally within their right to expect respect from house guests.", "Maybe yall should spend less time at her place.", "NTA\n\nHer roomates didn't sign up to live with a man so i get it. Might be time to spend less time there", "NTA, you gf needs to learn that the world does not stop and start at her convenience", "NTA the roommates probably don't want you there days at a time.

It is not your place to ignore it. It is your girlfriend\u2019s place. If she wants in the kitchen, she should go, not put you in the line of fire.", "YTA. Both you and your gf.

I've shared with several people like your gf but unfortunately their partners didn't have your consideration for others.\n\nWhy is your gf so insistent on forcing the issue, does she deliberately want to cause drama in the house and cause others to feel uncomfortable in their own home? It's a very selfish attitude she has.", ">my girlfriend thinks I am putting them on a pedestal and I am ignoring what she wants (us in the kitchen more)\n\nINFO\n\nWhy does she want to be in the kitchen so much? Besides from actually cooking dinner, what is the point in hanging out in the kitchen more when there are better locations in the house for that? Does she have a private bedroom? Does this house have a decent sized front room?", "OP won't even walk through the kitchen to use the restroom... Like, what? That would be a red flag for me in a partner...", "With the edit, it appears she doesn't want OP to get a bladder infection from not using the restroom to avoid *walking* through the kitchen... Seems OP has taken the request too far and I'd be annoyed at someone doing a peepee dance in my room instead of swiftly walking to/from the bathroom. And maybe gf wants to eat her food in the kitchen instead of crumbs all over her space, since OP wanted to vacate the kitchen immediately after cooking?\n\nI'm thinking ESH. They should get a hotel room or she should stay with OP if OP is just gonna be too scared to leave her room everytime he comes over.", "NTA for this specific question but YTA overall, and so is your girlfriend. You are clearly there way, way, WAY too often. She needs to come to you sometimes.", "NTA\n\nYou've acted very reasonably and what is this shit about being kicked out and made to sit in your car lol...\n\nDon't waste your time with this controlling psycho", "Heaven forbid we finally see a sensible answer in this subreddit. OP states he is basically always there and clearly the roommates don\u2019t want his non rent paying ass over there.", "Kitchen leads the bathroom which is why it seems so peculiar. In the edit OP states he'll wait until the housemates leave the kitchen before he can use the bathroom. They really need to reduce their time there so everyone can feel more comfortable but I feel like OP is overcorrecting and most people wouldn't mind someone passing by to use the washroom.", "How is he the asshole? He is trying to avoid them as they asked him to.", "Also, it is a little uncomfortable to have a man around in a house of women. In some ways, they might feel restricted. And gf is missing out on roommate bonding opportunities. But it also seemed like gf didnt care if they were uncomfortable.\n\nYou are right. Essentially, he is taking up space he didnt pay for. \n\nTo solve all matters, go out and date. Or get your own space to play house. Or spend some time at OP's place.", "Did you not read the whole section where OP clearly states he is staying there a LOT more? His gf\u2019s roommates want his leeching ass gone! He is not a tenant and this situation could be entirely avoided by the gf moving out and finding her own place.", "From OPs edit he seems to be overcorrecting so much he won't even pass through the kitchen to use the bathroom if the other house mates are occupying the kitchen. I can definitely understand them not feeling comfortable around a couple or man they don't know but I feel like it would be reasonable to let him pass to go pee lol. Idk if it's solely down to the gf not caring about the roommates and not wanting the boyfriend to feel so awkward he can't pass by to use the washroom.\n\nReducing the amount of time at the girlfriends place seem like the way to go but OP should be able to use the washroom when needed.", "Amen. It seems this sub has an issue with \u201creading between the lines\u201d and immediately rush to call OP not an asshole when BOTH him and his GF are assholes for different reasons. \n\nThe post should really read \u201cI\u2019m at my GFs house that she shares with other women roommates all the time. I don\u2019t pay rent and they are hinting at me that I\u2019m there too much. AITA?\u201d", "He is overcorrecting because he knows he isnt welcomed.\n\nWait. Are you saying those ladies knew he needed to pee and did not allow him to? How are they supposed to know he needs to pee and when? He should say \"excuse me, ladies\" and go.", "I agree. A few of the posts seem to not see what the real issue is.", "Of course that's why but he literally will not pass by them or use your example of excuse me ladies. The house mates probably have no idea because as soon as he hears people in the kitchen he waits until it's empty. That's not the roommate's fault, I am saying he is overcorrecting, which he shouldn't do. He should do as you suggest and just say excuse me so he can use the bathroom. I don't think the housemates are aware he's going to that extent but his GF is telling him to stop holding it in.", "You raised a good point here. Initially i thought he was just trying to accommodate them. But you made me realise that he too feels uncomfortable being there."]}
