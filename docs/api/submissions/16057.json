I've shared with several people like your gf but unfortunately their partners didn't have your consideration for others.\n\nWhy is your gf so insistent on forcing the issue, does she deliberately want to cause drama in the house and cause others to feel uncomfortable in their own home?

That would be a red flag for me in a partner...", "With the edit, it appears she doesn't want OP to get a bladder infection from not using the restroom to avoid *walking* through the kitchen... Seems OP has taken the request too far and I'd be annoyed at someone doing a peepee dance in my room instead of swiftly walking to/from the bathroom. And maybe gf wants to eat her food in the kitchen instead of crumbs all over her space, since OP wanted to vacate the kitchen immediately after cooking?\n\nI'm thinking ESH. They should get a hotel room or she should stay with OP if OP is just gonna be too scared to leave her room everytime he comes over.", "NTA for this specific question but YTA overall, and so is your girlfriend.

In the edit OP states he'll wait until the housemates leave the kitchen before he can use the bathroom. They really need to reduce their time there so everyone can feel more comfortable but I feel like OP is overcorrecting and most people wouldn't mind someone passing by to use the washroom.", "How is he the asshole? He is trying to avoid them as they asked him to.", "Also, it is a little uncomfortable to have a man around in a house of women. In some ways, they might feel restricted. And gf is missing out on roommate bonding opportunities. But it also seemed like gf didnt care if they were uncomfortable.\n\nYou are right. Essentially, he is taking up space he didnt pay for. \n\nTo solve all matters, go out and date. Or get your own space to play house. Or spend some time at OP's place.", "Did you not read the whole section where OP clearly states he is staying there a LOT more? His gf\u2019s roommates want his leeching ass gone! He is not a tenant and this situation could be entirely avoided by the gf moving out and finding her own place.", "From OPs edit he seems to be overcorrecting so much he won't even pass through the kitchen to use the bathroom if the other house mates are occupying the kitchen. I can definitely understand them not feeling comfortable around a couple or man they don't know but I feel like it would be reasonable to let him pass to go pee lol. Idk if it's solely down to the gf not caring about the roommates and not wanting the boyfriend to feel so awkward he can't pass by to use the washroom.\n\nReducing the amount of time at the girlfriends place seem like the way to go but OP should be able to use the washroom when needed.", "Amen. It seems this sub has an issue with \u201creading between the lines\u201d and immediately rush to call OP not an asshole when BOTH him and his GF are assholes for different reasons. \n\nThe post should really read \u201cI\u2019m at my GFs house that she shares with other women roommates all the time.

A few of the posts seem to not see what the real issue is.", "Of course that's why but he literally will not pass by them or use your example of excuse me ladies. The house mates probably have no idea because as soon as he hears people in the kitchen he waits until it's empty. That's not the roommate's fault, I am saying he is overcorrecting, which he shouldn't do. He should do as you suggest and just say excuse me so he can use the bathroom. I don't think the housemates are aware he's going to that extent but his GF is telling him to stop holding it in.", "You raised a good point here. Initially i thought he was just trying to accommodate them.

I find AITA\u2019s take on what\u2019s acceptable flatmate behaviour kind of questionable at times tbh. If it\u2019s went from 1 weekend every 2 weeks to every weekend \u2026 that\u2019s different from essentially having a whole new flatmate who is there every day. \n\nUnless he\u2019s practically moved in, the flatmates are free to *wish* for OP to stop spending nights there of course, but if they force it OP\u2019s gf will be 100% entitled to extend that same rule to any and all people her flatmates have over. \n\nNot allowing significant others over because you don\u2019t like \u2018strange men\u2019 in your house will turn into an absolute shit show the moment any of the other girls bring a partner or a one night stand.", "Yeah I completely understand that. \n\nAs I said we are an ldr so travelling is already quite expensive, she has the place because it\u2019s close to uni and it wouldn\u2019t be worth paying for a hotel while I\u2019m down there, as selfish as that may seem. \n\nShe is going to be getting a studio next year anyway", "My gf said what you said. I just find it difficult and as if I should just wait when I\u2019d have to walk past everyone staring at me as I walk in", "They said they were uncomfortable with me, I am uncomfortable with them seeing me now so I\u2019d rather wait as long as I\u2019m not busting", "\ud83d\ude2d I pee twice a day so I don\u2019t find it hard to hold It. They are also not usually in there for more than 30 mins straight. She\u2019s fine with food in the room and is just rather be in the kitchen for the minimum amount of time", "I agree so much with the male guest female roommate situation. I (straight woman) lived in an apartment with three women. One of them had her bf over all the time in her room taking showers hanging out etc. he was extremely polite and clean and pleasant to be around but it still hindered me from living like I wanted to. It\u2019s not that weird to be in your undies doing laundry in an apartment full of women but once you toss a straight guy into the mix the situation feels a bit awkward.", "Yeah I agree. The contract for the place ends soon and she\u2019ll be getting a studio next year", "That would be correct but there\u2019s more to it than that, I do pay rent but only to my girlfriend. But besides when I\u2019m in the kitchen they wouldn\u2019t even know I\u2019m here, we are really quiet and they have no problem at all besides me being in the kitchen\n\nRegardless I do understand it\u2019s not my house so I should be more mindful too", "Definitely. Even a simple walking around the house without a bra, or getting out of the showers in towel.", "At this point they know him", "Hmm that\u2019s actually a really good point \n\nI think you are right with that last sentence and it\u2019s causing the problem. I understand I should just use the restroom when I need but when everyone\u2019s in their talking and I walk in and it\u2019s silent and I can feel the stares, just isn\u2019t good so I\u2019d hold it", "I definitely get the awkward feeling and the eyes on you. I'm sorry to hear you feel to awkward in the house that going to the bathroom has to be put off. I would talk with your girlfriend about trying to lessen the time there to make everyone more comfortable. You can also cause yourself bladder problems by holding it in so there is reason for concern.", "NTA you don\u2019t live there. You don\u2019t pay rent. You shouldn\u2019t make the people who do live and pay rent feel uncomfortable. Your girlfriend is rude", "He doesn't pay rent there I assume. Why shouldn't they have boundaries about their place?", "They can have boundaries. The post isn't AITA for being in my gfs shared house all the time, it's AITA for not doing what my gf wants.\n\nIn this case, he's not an ahole for not doing what his gf wants.", "Reduce your time there because of the friction it is causing with house mates. They may feel resentful for you being around so much without paying. If you need to use the washroom though, politely saying excuse me shouldn't be a problem. The looks can really get to you but holding things in can cause medical problems so I would suggest dealing with the stares over possible bladder problems and such. You need to priotrize yourself as well, it is great you don't want to make others uncomfortable but your girlfriend is seeing your prioritize someone else's feelings over a needing to use the washroom and that may worry her aswell. It's hard to say since we don't hear your girlfriends side but I'm guessing she wants you not to put yourself last. Not sure but best of luck with the situation, and stop holding it in,  it'll case problems lol.", "The hard thing with lessening the time we spend together is that my house is a pretty bad environment rn as my relationships with my parents isn\u2019t good, me and my gf work well together when I\u2019m over on uni stuff, other places are really expensive\n\n I know it selfish as other people are living there but we are quiet and keep to ourselves almost all the time", "I was wondering since that seemed the most obvious solution, there was likely other reasons. I wish I had more suggestions but know how difficult it is with the cost of living, especially in some areas.  Could try to plan more days outside of the house so it's closer to what you were staying over before. You may have to just cut back unfortunately because it seems pretty uncomfortable and tense in the house if you can't even go to the bathroom without stares. I'd be curious if those were looks you were expecting so you thought you saw them glaring more. I could be totally off but I know a few people who often felt like people were constantly watching them in public and would say people would give them dirty looks when it definitely wasn't the case. Perhaps your more aware now and are always looking for looks even when they are not there? Either way I hope you can get comfortable enough to pass by for the bathroom.\n\nAs great as it is you guys keep to yourself and stay quiet and extra guest often puts people on their toes.", "Apparently, he is paying rent to his girlfriend.", "Then he can pay rent for a space for only them 2 and then the problem is solved. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the gf is the AH tho", "Do her roommates know that she's making a profit from this arrangement?"]}
