When I came down recently her housemates asked my girlfriend if it would be okay if I didn\u2019t go in the kitchen as much and wouldn\u2019t go in when they are cooking. They also said they sometimes wait until me and my gf are done in the kitchen before they use it as they find it uncomfortable and awkward.\n\nMe and my girlfriend both agreed it\u2019s fine and is okay. However, a couple days later, I wouldn\u2019t go into the kitchen if I heard the housemates in there and would wait but my gf told me to just go. Additionally, I once tried to leave the kitchen as I didn\u2019t have anymore cooking to do incase the house mates were gonna come down and my gf got annoyed. I was just trying to avoid contact as I don\u2019t want the housemates to feel awkward \n\nI still do the washing up late at night and will be with my gf sometimes when she cooks so it\u2019s not about me finding an excuse to be lazy. \n\nAnyway, I expressed how I can\u2019t go in the kitchen as much and I am trying to avoid them but my girlfriend thinks I am putting them on a pedestal and I am ignoring what she wants (us in the kitchen more)\n\nWe argued back and forth and I was just explaining how I don\u2019t want anyone to feel awkward and our time in the kitchen is a fraction of the day so it won\u2019t matter. \n\nShe refused to talk to me for a while and now kicked me out the house, I\u2019ve just been sat in my car with only my phone for hours.\n\n\nEdit: as people asked why the kitchen was a source of conflict:\n\nTo get to the toilet you have to go through the kitchen (weird house build), so I would usually just wait if I needed it for the other girls to leave the kitchen and my girlfriend didn\u2019t like that I would wait", "created_utc": 1682859978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133pbj9/aita_for_not_prioritising_my_girlfriend/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you OP on that.   \nYour gf is weird, does she not think of the consequences of potential conflict with her roommates ? She lives with 4 women, they may not feel comfortable with a complete stranger in their home, and may not feel comfortable sharing space with a man.

I've shared with several people like your gf but unfortunately their partners didn't have your consideration for others.\n\nWhy is your gf so insistent on forcing the issue, does she deliberately want to cause drama in the house and cause others to feel uncomfortable in their own home?

Besides from actually cooking dinner, what is the point in hanging out in the kitchen more when there are better locations in the house for that? Does she have a private bedroom? Does this house have a decent sized front room?", "OP won't even walk through the kitchen to use the restroom... Like, what? That would be a red flag for me in a partner...", "With the edit, it appears she doesn't want OP to get a bladder infection from not using the restroom to avoid *walking* through the kitchen... Seems OP has taken the request too far and I'd be annoyed at someone doing a peepee dance in my room instead of swiftly walking to/from the bathroom. And maybe gf wants to eat her food in the kitchen instead of crumbs all over her space, since OP wanted to vacate the kitchen immediately after cooking?\n\nI'm thinking ESH. They should get a hotel room or she should stay with OP if OP is just gonna be too scared to leave her room everytime he comes over."]}
