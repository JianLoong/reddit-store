My sister didn't outright say she didn't want us there, but we didn't see much of her in the lead up. We didn't really know any of the people at the party, so we're going around introducing ourselves to people, mingling, doing the party thing. At some point, someone mentions the family photos on the well and how they were surprised to see a ton of us on the wall when they didn't even know my sister had siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThis sent me down a whole rabbit hole of confusion. This person elaborated and said she was surprised to see this type of photo on the wall because apparently my sister has told all of her friends that my parents were extreme workaholics. We have a really nice house so they weren't surprised by that, just that it felt properly homey and lived in. Once again, I was thrown for a loop.\r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, our home was THE house. We had friends over constantly who were basically like extra siblings. My parents worked the normal amount, and they were home with us as much as possible. We got chauffeured around to sports practices, my parents took the time to get to know all of our friends well, etc. I would even go so far as to say they were more involved in our lives than average. It was my sister who really separated herself from everyone and chose to exclude herself from activities.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point during this conversation, a few other people overheard and soon enough there was a decent crowd of her friends around my brothers and I, listening to stories of us growing up that were blowing these people's minds because it's apparently common knowledge among their friend group that our parents were so hands on, and UN common knowledge that we even existed. I ended up having a really good time and felt like I made some new friends.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the event, apparently my sister was crying because I embarrassed her in front of all of her friends and that the work she had put in to separate herself from us \"golden children\" had been undone.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689545400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151j85k/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_at_her_engagement/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In fact - It\u2019s fairly common for the oldest and youngest children\u2019s experiences to differ substantially\u2026.as well as male versus female children. Before trying to prove that your sister is a liar at a party of people you didn\u2019t know, why didn\u2019t you talk to her first to see why she might have said those things? It\u2019s obvious you guys aren\u2019t close\u2026so don\u2019t be so arrogant to think that her perspective is wrong and yours is right.

On my third birthday I got a second hand bike.  My Mum and brother both got brand new bikes that same day.\n\nMy brother had a wonderful childhood.  Anything he wanted to do the family did.

Calling someone a workaholic carries the context that they don't have time for anything but work or will put you second.\n\nHow did everyone gather around you to listen to childhood stories? At some point you'd think they'd seek the sister out? \n\nAlso no offense I can't believe some friends childhood family adventure stories drew a crowd. That sounds boring as shit.

Are you sure these are lies, not just that she experienced childhood differently to you? Because her reaction suggests that\u2019s the case. \n\nShe\u2019s 3 years older so may have experienced v different treatment. Also, how much it is \u2018normal\u2019 to work is actually subjective, she may have felt that they worked a lot because her needs weren\u2019t prioritised whereas yours were.

You assume it\u2019s all a huge lie because it doesn\u2019t match your experience, but you already acknowledged that she had a completely different experience. You blame her for it, but you do know that her experience of growing up in that house was different than yours. \n\nIn your eyes she self-isolated.

Are you sure your parents were involved with her too? Or did they work a lot while she was a child and figure out how to be more involved when you came along? Children can have vastly different experiences even in the same household, so what she remembers or feels about her childhood is valid, providing she isn\u2019t blatantly lying.

Twins had absolutely no idea until they were 16 and started noticing things and asking questions.
