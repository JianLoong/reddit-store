Me and my two brothers (one is 22, two of us are 21) have been on the other side of US for the majority of 2023 and didn't think we were going to be there for the party, but plans shifted and we ended up arriving home last Wednesday. \r  \n\r  \nNow I'm honestly not sure if I was invited so much as we simply happened to live where the event was being hosted, because it was held in my parents' house. My sister didn't outright say she didn't want us there, but we didn't see much of her in the lead up. We didn't really know any of the people at the party, so we're going around introducing ourselves to people, mingling, doing the party thing. At some point, someone mentions the family photos on the well and how they were surprised to see a ton of us on the wall when they didn't even know my sister had siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThis sent me down a whole rabbit hole of confusion. This person elaborated and said she was surprised to see this type of photo on the wall because apparently my sister has told all of her friends that my parents were extreme workaholics. We have a really nice house so they weren't surprised by that, just that it felt properly homey and lived in. Once again, I was thrown for a loop.\r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, our home was THE house. We had friends over constantly who were basically like extra siblings. My parents worked the normal amount, and they were home with us as much as possible. We got chauffeured around to sports practices, my parents took the time to get to know all of our friends well, etc. I would even go so far as to say they were more involved in our lives than average. It was my sister who really separated herself from everyone and chose to exclude herself from activities.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point during this conversation, a few other people overheard and soon enough there was a decent crowd of her friends around my brothers and I, listening to stories of us growing up that were blowing these people's minds because it's apparently common knowledge among their friend group that our parents were so hands on, and UN common knowledge that we even existed. I ended up having a really good time and felt like I made some new friends.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the event, apparently my sister was crying because I embarrassed her in front of all of her friends and that the work she had put in to separate herself from us \"golden children\" had been undone.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689545400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151j85k/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_at_her_engagement/", "score": 2938, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This could have led her to see the parents being too busy for her, then suddenly having time to shuttle the boys to hockey, etc. Still not sure why she said they embarrassed her. She should have told her \"truth\", in a sea of concentration on the younger children, she seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle. The truth would have been damning enough. There was no need to be embarrassed, just sad, disappointed and mad to have been pushed aside again . OP's failure to recognize their advantages changes my initial thoughts to YTA.

You know this is your sister\u2019s party, and you\u2019ve acknowledged that these people are *her* social circle, not yours. You don\u2019t know any of them. It\u2019s immediately clear to you that she\u2019s told them things you don\u2019t agree with and not even told them she has siblings.

She might be totally off in her retellings from your POV, but unless you\u2019ve spoken with her about it, there\u2019s no way to know how she felt about her relationship with your parents.

Spoilt youngest child vibes are strong in the post", "I agree with this 100%. Definitely YTA, especially after seeing OP\u2019s responses.", "This, 1000x this. She is the only daughter, and several years older than OP. And even though I KNOW my parents love me and my sister and my brother equally and always TRIED to be fair, my brother got favored in many ways. It definitely sounds like OP intentionally set out to ruin her party when he got personally offended she doesn't talk about him more. So from where I'm sitting, 100% YTA. I would LOVE to hear sister's perspective.", "I feel bad for the sister; they've gone, and stole her friends.", "It was 'common knowledge' that the parents really stepped up and treated their children well, but 'uncommon knowledge' that it wasn't about a special child; they did it for everyone. \n\nIt sounds like the sister might have painted herself as unique and deserving of amazing treatment when actually, she was just like everyone else.", "Yeah, I have a feeling there\u2019s more to this story, but this part is so weird.", "I don't  bring up my brother's in conversation. I've worked with people for 11 years who would be surprised. Sure they are coworkers, but I spend 8 hours a day with these people.", "If I had to guess, it was that she never spoke of the boys because she was tired of being defined as their sister.  The boys did this. The boys did that... \"Oh, your Ops sister(like she doesn't have a name).\" The vote is 3 to one for the boys' activity. Or she's a spoiled jealous princess who hated losing her only child status.  My bet is in the first one.", "It definitely seems that at least a couple lies were told if people also had the impression of the parents being workaholics. It's one thing not mentioning the siblings due to not being close or having issues with them (though surprised it wasn't mentioned in that capacity even - oh I have 3 brothers but we are low contact), it's another people having seemingly false assumptions about the parents and their lifestyle. Unless maybe she just expressed their role in her life in very poor word choice so it seems she suggested they were workaholics, but really meant weren't actively involved with her?", "That was definitely my first thought as well. Why have the party at your parents house of all places if you're trying to keep your friends in the dark about your siblings? It's odd. I feel like we're missing some pieces to the puzzle here.", "Before I saw your comment, I commented a very similar thing. Something is just off about everything here.", "Yeah and if she wanted to keep this narrative she created about being an only child, poorly neglected by her parents, she probably shouldn't have had a party at...the house her brothers lived in, and was full of evidence of their existence and their parents?", "I don\u2019t know. If I was having a party at my parents\u2019 house and my siblings still lived nearby, I think the invitation would be implied (unless it\u2019s a fancy pay with real invitations).", "I'm wondering about OP's skewed perspective and whether the sister did even outright lie. E.g. did she say that her parents were workaholics or did she say they were never around? Or did the parents use work as an excuse to get out of doing things for her? \n\nIf there is a golden child/scapegoat dynamic here then the golden child(ren) are NTA for experiencing that, that's on the parents. But for him to present his childhood as _the_ narrative without leaving any space for her reality is AH behaviour.", "Agreed 100%.\nI come from a large family and my (older) 5 siblings childhood experiences were vastly different than mine and my one younger sibling.\nSo much so that neither of us have anything to do with the rest of the family except with each other.\n\nLiterally don't mention my family growing up. \n\nOne person's experiences does not mean the others were the same, nor even how they perceived it if raised at the same time.\n\nYou are spot on.", "Agreed especially as the older girl, I could see her losing her childhood to take care of her younger siblings", "The vibe I get is that the older sister (the eldest) had to sacrifice some of her childhood taking care of her younger brothers (I don\u2019t know if OP is male or female) while the parents got their careers established. Once the boys were in high school the parents had more time to devote to the boys and their friends. Sister separated herself because she didn\u2019t get that opportunity. I also don\u2019t feel like she lied to her friends, she just doesn\u2019t talk about it because it is hard.", "I don\u2019t think the issue was them talking at all. But holding court and telling stories of themselves growing up \u2014 at their sibling\u2019s engagement party \u2014 is a far extreme. Even as OP puts it, he and his brothers made their sister\u2019s engagement party about themselves.", "She may have been pressured into that.  Parents offered and she didn't or couldn't decline without opening a ton of wounds.", "I mean, I\u2019m willing to guess she\u2019s T A because there\u2019s WAY more to the story from the sister\u2019s side. \n\nAnd quite frankly, she\u2019s TA because when she heard her sister\u2019s interpretation of their youth, her first action was to contradict it to all the *sister\u2019s* friends (who she\u2019s never even MET before). The lack of empathy and social skills is appalling.", "What no... she didn't say she told them her sister separated herself at all, that was info for us. Just she was surprised to hear they didn't know anything about them and thought wrongly of her parents. And that she just told stories about their childhood. And evidently had zero idea there was any issue about this until the sister was crying saying 'she'd worked so hard to separate herself from them to her friends'. Because people all seemed to like her and chatting to her and listening to her stories.\n\nLike, the sister is an adult at this point, there's no excuse for not self developing and telling a ton of lies, so that even your closest friends don't know you have siblings, and thinking that ruse will just stick forever and nobody will find out. These things will ALWAYS come crashing down eventually. OP isn't the AH for unknowingly being the one to bring the web of lies down by telling fun stories about growing up.\n\nIf the sister has issues, at that age, it's up to her to address them because OP clearly had no idea she felt that way. She's keeping in touch with her parents and having her party at the parent's house.. like what did she expect to happen? It's the siblings themselves she seems to have an issue with which is why she never even directly invited them. It sounds like the party was deliberately arranged when they were away also, and they just happened to come back and the parents invited their other kids also not knowing how the sister felt.\n\nShe was at her own engagement party for goodness sake. She should've been focusing on that and enjoying that, instead of being jealous people were having fun listening to her siblings tell stories. Evidently nobody in the family knows she feels that way because they aren't mind readers and rather than telling them, she's just distanced herself from them to the point of not inviting them to her engagement event over perceived childhood wrongs. She needs to grow up.", "How did she lie? OP doesn't say that she lied. Only that when he grew up, the parents spent more time with him and his friends.", "Two things can be true at once. Sister is a few years older, parents probably worked their ass off for their expensive house and weren't around much. OP is then born and parents have quit work and have time to attend to them. \"Golden children\" makes sense", "Opposite in my family. I'm the youngest and only girl and I was largely overshadowed by my brothers and used at the scapegoat. We had very different childhoods. My brothers are 5, 7, and 9 years older than me and in my father's eyes, they can do wrong. Me on the other hand was constantly told that I was not good enough and an embarrassment. \n\nFreaking crazy how different families can be.", "Well spotted, I hadn't noticed that the only girl is 3 years older than the next.\n\nI was 3 years older than my brother, and got scolded in his stead from time to time: \"why did you let him fall from that tree\", like, hello, he climbed it like a monkey, what did you expect me to do?\nLooking back, it's mostly my father being unable to regulate his emotions: he ventilated his worry over my brother's bumps and bruises (he didn't have any serious injuries) by screaming at me. And my mom. And then my brother too. And then all of us. \n\nStill, I can see how an elder girl might have felt burdened with a lot of responsibility.\n\nI think it's the small details of OP entertaining a whole crowd, with stories he knew directly opposed what his sister's friends believed... and of \"I felt like I made some new friends\".\nTo me, that reads so oblivious, it wouldn't surprise me OP has never picked up any nuances of his sister's experience.", "Hard same. My sister was only a year younger than me but she got away with *way* more than I ever would have even dreamed of trying. Like literally she threw a house party and our parents thanked her for cleaning up, then turned around and interrogated *me* about whether she'd told me and grounded me for a week for not finding out and giving them the heads up.", "My sister is just 2 years younger and we had vastly different childhoods. In our case it didn't even have to do with how our parents treated us but came out of the fact that they moved into a new neighborhood belonging to a different school district between us starting schools.\n\nBoth my younger siblings went to school with middle class kids living pre-dominantly in houses. I went to school with lower income apartment kids with frequently unemployed parents.\n\nJust 2 years apart but very different environments. My sisters never noticed my friends couldn't afford to go to the cinema or that I never got invited to a friend's summer house. Ofc I noticed that my sisters got to do tons more fun stuff with their friends.\n\nThey still talk about how \"we grew up\" because they didn't notice the differences. They don't know my class had an extra assistent whose sole purpose was to break up fights. They don't know I never had a proper math teacher nor science teacher before high school (the one we had the longest was an unemployed actor).", "Yep my adopted uncle got kicked out at 15. It was an extremely abusive household for my uncle  but not so much for his youngers bros. In the end my uncle found out his mom got him from an older alcoholic and probably not consenual.\n\nHis lil bro asked him why he left home at 15. He said; i got kicked out\n\nHis bro was completely surprised and suddenly remembered my uncle got daily beatings, cigs&bottles thrown at him and the verbal humiliation", "It could even be unintentional favoritism. Three boys, two twins and one born barely a year before. That takes up a lot of parental attention. In all likelihood the three brothers shared friends, making it easier to set up play dates, do carpooling, and getting to know people. Especially if the boys shared enough interests to be treated as a group.\n\nMeanwhile, you have the older girl. She\u2019s not one of \u2018the triplets\u2019 so that automatically creates distance. She has a completely different friend group, different interests, different needs. So she feels ostracized. \n\nAnd, because the \u2018triplets\u2019 take so much attention, she feels like she doesn\u2019t get any/enough. The triplets individually may even get the same attention as her, but because they can often be treated as a group, she effectively gets less. \n\nTo put it another way, parents are being fair and each child gets one play date for one weekend a month. So parents set up a play date for daughter. Daughter gets her one play date. Then parents arrange for Boy A to have a play date. But since they share friends, boys B and C also get a play date along with A. So the boys get three effective play dates a month.\n\nYou can put that to just about anything else. It\u2019s entirely possible that sister technically got the same as her brothers individually, but the brothers got more collectively. And the brothers never noticed an issue, since they never really hit a point of being unhappy with being treated as a group.", "I was left out of a lot of family activities with my cousins as a child growing up. I struggle connecting with my cousins and I often feel socially awkward because of that exclusion as a child. I tend to avoid social situations that aren\u2019t required or expected attendance at this point of my life.\n\nI am so much more comfortable around my bf\u2019s family for some reason. I\u2019m still quiet but they actually talk to me and make an effort whereas my family pretty ignores me in social situations. \n\nMy brother recently had been on a sort of social protest but I\u2019m pretty sure now his relationship with the rest of our family is beyond repair. Even though he knew he had a privilege being favored by dad, that relationship is beyond repair now.", "As the only girl in a family with 3 brothers, I totally agree.

Every so often she does a vanishing act, tells social services she doesn't want her family to know where she is, last time it was because her neighbours phoned the police for a welfare check because the stench coming from her flat made them think she'd died in there. The police asked her dad to come when they went in case she needed support/was alive but distressed. She put it all on her twitter account that she thinks no-one know about, saying that her dad lied to the police to get them to come so he could shout at her (?!), she lied that her grandfather died of covid (he died of cancer) and no-one told her (they did, thats how she knew to put it on twitter), fundraised for money to go to his funeral (despite that her mum offered to pay for her transport and hotel costs to see him before he died - she didn't go to see him and she didn't go to the funeral, but she took strangers' money, and rang her mum to ask if her grandad had left her any money because she'd run out of cigarettes), she regularly posts about how hard up she is for money, every time there's any extreme weather of any description she posts that it has cut off her electric and her freezer totally defrosted - usually within 4-6 hours - and she needs money for a food shop, or her electricity is being cut off, or her Internet is being cut off. I think her purse \"got stolen\" 3 times in 6 months - she's not used that one in a while so I'm waiting for that one to come out again. She constantly posts her PayPal begging for money for all these things - her washing machine broke down again and she's lost all the clothes in it, the radiator fell off the wall, etc. She lives in social housing which is maintained in our country, but she'll claim that the needed her radiators bled (that she could do herself with a 75p key) and that it cost her \u00a3500+, even though all plumbers in our area quote less than \u00a3100 to do something like 16 radiators, and she lives in flat with max 5. She has created an entirely fictional online life, stating that her father was physically violent (he's not), her brother (my partner) almost died of a drug overdose (he didn't), and has a following that completely swallows all her lies and sends her money, buys her tons of shit on throne gifts... she smashed her old laptop and they bought her a new one, she's already asking for another one because the old one wasn't good enough apparently.

Sometimes I tell my sister some of the \u201cgrandmas cases\u201d just to help her understand why I am not against her being nice with them, but won't ever get along with them and possibly one day will make a nice dance on their fckn graves. \n\nOP, better talk to your sister and learn her experience.

My parents PREACHED equality in all things when we were growing up, no favoritism in how much financial help we'd all get, everyone would have the same chances and opportunities, blah blah blah. I mean, they really beat it into us. I knew I was in a deficit for most things, but generally it was experiences and more intangible stuff like just being nice to me. I'd kinda written it off until I had asked for help paying for school and they balked because i decided to go mid 20s instead of at 17 and I dropped it. Then I found out how much middle sibling was getting per semester and I just lost it. I actually made a list line for line everything my siblings got that I didn't, I even gave grace in areas that I knew were because I just missed the boat on because my parents made better money later when I was out of the house already. But maaaannnnnnn did they go white when I quoted back all of the things they told us growing up, they were both on the losing end in their families because other siblings were favorites and so many stories of how hurt they had been emotionally or behind the eight ball financially for not being treated equally. Most of the emotional and experience and parenting style stuff they still won't cop to even with proof. But for about 5 years now my siblings and I keep a basic tally to make sure we're all being treated fairly financially. I'm lucky to have siblings that care enough that we back each other. For us it's just forcing them to keep their word after preaching about it for so long.

If her siblings are still blaming her for what happened as kids then there's really no way that they're supportive, understanding, or even a little empathetic. In a similar situation I'd probably be tempted to come up with the same stories she did just for the sake of simplicity and not having to constantly delve into that trauma when connecting with friends over upbringing and family history. Honestly, reading into it deeper it doesn't even seem like she outright lied it sounds more like she just said very little. Not talking about siblings can certainly seem like she might be an only child, the reaction from her friends sounds like she never mentioned one way or another and they made an assumption. Just saying she didn't have a good relationship with her parents because they worked a lot is way easier than going into the muck of her full experience. That would make a lot more sense as the reality of how she discussed her family when this party was hosted in her parents house. If she had said outright she was an only child I imagine there would be worse feelings than just slight confusion among her friends, because to be fair that's a pretty big lie to tell. These siblings have a lot to unpack, individually and together. And seriously, I hope so many good things for big sis.

Also, my experience with my siblings being willing to be understanding of our differences in experience is an exception to the general rule. Op already blames their sister for being isolated when they were kids. If a wall was built between them by circumstance before any of them could be understanding of each other then I'd be surprised younger siblings would've reacted well to that statement.

It's a great opportunity for OP and his brothers to learn his sisters perspective on their upbringing. Hopefully, OP actually takes the opportunity to learn. But in this scenario, all he did was ruin his sister's party.", "But they aren\u2019t lies. It\u2019s all pretty subjective, \u2018working a normal amount\u2019\u2026 by whose standards? These are competing stories, not hard facts. It seems that OP was really, really clear that these stories were controdicting the narrative the sister gave and seemed really pleased. What was the point? If not to one-up her.", "Are you seriously saying that OP monopolizing his sister's engagement party to tell old stories of how happy he and his brothers were then congratulating himself on making new friends was in any way acceptable", "If any adult can understand two sides, why are you so sure she\u2019s wrong? I just don\u2019t see any \u2018lies\u2019 here, there is a different narrative. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have invited them if it was purely bs for pity", "Ah, yes, I see. But even so it\u2019s at the parents\u2019 house? Where if there were lies it\u2019d be likely they\u2019d be uncovered? Plus, these cannot really be lies because it\u2019s all so subjective, it\u2019s competing impressions not solid facts. Also, not checking if you\u2019re invited is entitled, golden child type behaviour.", "Or she was embarrassed that her golden siblings again got the spotlight at an event meant solely for her", "My take from admittedly what is a vague story, was when the younger siblings introduced themselves, combined with the family pictures was a big bomb when the older sister's friends were so surprised. The two things didn't match and unfortunately, overtook the party.  Of course we are hearing one side. It would be great to question them both.", "1) no need to be so fucking rude mate, step off\n\n2) if they've been on the other side of the country for most of 2023, they haven't been living at the house  so it's not their primary residence. \n\n3) No matter the accuracy airing family business and making such a fuss just isn't cool. There's a time and place for these things to be sorted.\n\n4) There's not enough info and we don't know the sister's side of things to make a judgement on how accurate things are.", "Because they lacked any self awareness to direct the attention back to their sister. Why is this so hard for you to grasp? Do you have a sister who perhaps you\u2019re an asshole to?", "Nope, just this person because they seem very invested in defending the OP.", "The conversation was the initial one where the friend informed OP of sister's side of things. The paragraph with the sensitive information is clearly aimed at the reader.", "She was there and there were pictures on the wall. What were they supposed to do? Full Makeup?", "He could have read the room. He actively decided to keep telling stories and draw a crowd", "Twins have everything to do with a family\u2019s dynamics. They sometimes have their own language and often seem less aware of other people around them. Add another brother closer in age than sister and they could have easily become the 3 Musketeers without even being aware of it.", "Withholding information is lying by omission and a terrible precedent to set in a marriage", "I really appreciate this perspective. I\u2019m bummed that my comment that you replied to was downvoted, but that happens. At best we are outside looking in and trying to understand why this dynamic exists. At the end of the day, we only have access to OP and hopefully if he reads through all the comments, he will come out of this situation a better version of himself.", "The parents told them to be there", "That's what feels off to me. I can't imagine caring about whether someone told me about their siblings.   I'm at an engagement party for cocktails and charcuterie, not to play detective about how grown adults remember their childhood.", "Are you okay? Nobody was rude to you.", "Well maybe the bride shouldn\u2019t have created a false version of herself that had so many people confused. If people found it odd enough to want to hear about this \u201cother version\u201d obviously it was a huge departure from who she was. If she wanted to keep up her version maybe not have it at her parents house, which would obviously have her family there as well. I honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was an influencer with this mindset tbh", "Exactly! OP could have said something noncommital and carried on; why did he feel the need to share their whole childhood with some people he'd never see again?!", "Withholding details about your family from friends is not lying by omission bc it\u2019s not their business to know. Did OP mention the finance in the post? Maybe I missed it but I didn\u2019t see anything about what she told her fianc\u00e9 about her family.", "Which goes with the golden child accusation. And if my sister had a party, I\u2019d check with her, not anyone else.", "If OP and brothers live on the other side of the country and since they were children they have been drifting apart the sister could have easily not lied but none of the stories including siblings because sis was never around her brothers.\n\nI had a very good friend from age 8 to 13 then I moved to another state. I don't mention that friend because most of my formative life experiences came after age 13. If I was talking about first job, major school projects, or life in general I would never bring my old friend up. The sister's childhood could have been so isolated from her brothers that they just never come up in anything major in her life.", "Right it\u2019s an unimportant event to you so you\u2019re dismissing the sister and her feelings entirely. You\u2019re just as much an asshole as OP.", "Not according to the OP. They said that people didn't know that she had siblings. \n\nBig sis hasn't told people that she has no brothers (that would be lying). But if you know more than the OP please share the info...", "He was being rude and making fun of my previous comment", "I was a little bit rude. I quoted \"legit\" twice from their comment.", "You\u2019re up here making assumptions about a woman you don\u2019t know anything about based on the golden child\u2019s story.", "Right! Once you see a few people join in, just end the conversation. OP did this deliberately to steal the sister's shadow like he's been doing through all of their childhood", "Once again being the center of attention as they were growing up", "You can be blind if you want and we'll see the divorce AITA later in a year or two if this is how things are and she's BLAMING the siblings still", "Doesn\u2019t change she basically denied their existence", "Withholding information is lying by omission and a terrible precedent to set in a marriage", "Can you remind me how they managed to draw that much attention? I'm saying that you can't pretend that your siblings don't exist to your friends, invite said friends to the family home, where your siblings live and then get annoyed when your friends end up being very curious about your siblings.", "Not talking about your siblings is not the same thing as lying. Clearly the boys don\u2019t have much of a relationship with their older sister.", "So? That\u2019s not an actual lie, that\u2019s what I mean about it being a different narrative. Look what happened: Introverted sis has her engagement party crashed because her siblings just must make friends with her friends by telling a load of childhood stories which contradict how she conceptualises her past. She sees them as the golden children, you can see which she wants distance, that isn\u2019t actually a lie.", "lol ok Reddit marriage counselor.", "They were thrown into the situation by their parents. They didn\u2019t even care to be there initially too", "Are you trying to say that lying in a marriage is a good thing to have because if so, this is not about marriage counseling this is about you needing to figure out what\u2019s wrong with you"]}
