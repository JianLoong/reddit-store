Me and my two brothers (one is 22, two of us are 21) have been on the other side of US for the majority of 2023 and didn't think we were going to be there for the party, but plans shifted and we ended up arriving home last Wednesday. \r  \n\r  \nNow I'm honestly not sure if I was invited so much as we simply happened to live where the event was being hosted, because it was held in my parents' house. My sister didn't outright say she didn't want us there, but we didn't see much of her in the lead up. We didn't really know any of the people at the party, so we're going around introducing ourselves to people, mingling, doing the party thing. At some point, someone mentions the family photos on the well and how they were surprised to see a ton of us on the wall when they didn't even know my sister had siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThis sent me down a whole rabbit hole of confusion. This person elaborated and said she was surprised to see this type of photo on the wall because apparently my sister has told all of her friends that my parents were extreme workaholics. We have a really nice house so they weren't surprised by that, just that it felt properly homey and lived in. Once again, I was thrown for a loop.\r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, our home was THE house. We had friends over constantly who were basically like extra siblings. My parents worked the normal amount, and they were home with us as much as possible. We got chauffeured around to sports practices, my parents took the time to get to know all of our friends well, etc. I would even go so far as to say they were more involved in our lives than average. It was my sister who really separated herself from everyone and chose to exclude herself from activities.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point during this conversation, a few other people overheard and soon enough there was a decent crowd of her friends around my brothers and I, listening to stories of us growing up that were blowing these people's minds because it's apparently common knowledge among their friend group that our parents were so hands on, and UN common knowledge that we even existed. I ended up having a really good time and felt like I made some new friends.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the event, apparently my sister was crying because I embarrassed her in front of all of her friends and that the work she had put in to separate herself from us \"golden children\" had been undone.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1689545400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151j85k/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_at_her_engagement/", "score": 7967, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This could have led her to see the parents being too busy for her, then suddenly having time to shuttle the boys to hockey, etc. Still not sure why she said they embarrassed her. She should have told her \"truth\", in a sea of concentration on the younger children, she seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle. The truth would have been damning enough. There was no need to be embarrassed, just sad, disappointed and mad to have been pushed aside again . OP's failure to recognize their advantages changes my initial thoughts to YTA.

I was in a severely abusive friendship in my younger years, and both self isolated and was isolated from my family. Even when there were clear signs things were wrong, no one helped me. I fell into a toxic relationship with a survivor of the same abuser. My parents did not care if I didn't come home during that time. I stressed them out too much, and it was easier if I just disappeared to my partner's house for a few days. I was 16 when they made this clear.  \nMy brother doesn't have a great relationship with our parents because of the way he was hurt by them. I worked hard to get to a point of mutual understanding with them.  \nWhenever I move out of state, though, I'm not talking about my family.

I've worked with people for 11 years who would be surprised. Sure they are coworkers, but I spend 8 hours a day with these people.", "If I had to guess, it was that she never spoke of the boys because she was tired of being defined as their sister.  The boys did this. The boys did that... \"Oh, your Ops sister(like she doesn't have a name).\" The vote is 3 to one for the boys' activity. Or she's a spoiled jealous princess who hated losing her only child status.  My bet is in the first one.", "It definitely seems that at least a couple lies were told if people also had the impression of the parents being workaholics. It's one thing not mentioning the siblings due to not being close or having issues with them (though surprised it wasn't mentioned in that capacity even - oh I have 3 brothers but we are low contact), it's another people having seemingly false assumptions about the parents and their lifestyle. Unless maybe she just expressed their role in her life in very poor word choice so it seems she suggested they were workaholics, but really meant weren't actively involved with her?", "That was definitely my first thought as well. Why have the party at your parents house of all places if you're trying to keep your friends in the dark about your siblings? It's odd.

Something is just off about everything here.", "Yeah and if she wanted to keep this narrative she created about being an only child, poorly neglected by her parents, she probably shouldn't have had a party at...the house her brothers lived in, and was full of evidence of their existence and their parents?", "I don\u2019t know. If I was having a party at my parents\u2019 house and my siblings still lived nearby, I think the invitation would be implied (unless it\u2019s a fancy pay with real invitations).", "I'm wondering about OP's skewed perspective and whether the sister did even outright lie. E.g. did she say that her parents were workaholics or did she say they were never around? Or did the parents use work as an excuse to get out of doing things for her? \n\nIf there is a golden child/scapegoat dynamic here then the golden child(ren) are NTA for experiencing that, that's on the parents. But for him to present his childhood as _the_ narrative without leaving any space for her reality is AH behaviour.", "Agreed 100%.\nI come from a large family and my (older) 5 siblings childhood experiences were vastly different than mine and my one younger sibling.\nSo much so that neither of us have anything to do with the rest of the family except with each other.\n\nLiterally don't mention my family growing up. \n\nOne person's experiences does not mean the others were the same, nor even how they perceived it if raised at the same time.\n\nYou are spot on.", "Agreed especially as the older girl, I could see her losing her childhood to take care of her younger siblings", "The vibe I get is that the older sister (the eldest) had to sacrifice some of her childhood taking care of her younger brothers (I don\u2019t know if OP is male or female) while the parents got their careers established. Once the boys were in high school the parents had more time to devote to the boys and their friends. Sister separated herself because she didn\u2019t get that opportunity. I also don\u2019t feel like she lied to her friends, she just doesn\u2019t talk about it because it is hard.", "I don\u2019t think the issue was them talking at all. But holding court and telling stories of themselves growing up \u2014 at their sibling\u2019s engagement party \u2014 is a far extreme.

The lack of empathy and social skills is appalling.", "What no... she didn't say she told them her sister separated herself at all, that was info for us. Just she was surprised to hear they didn't know anything about them and thought wrongly of her parents. And that she just told stories about their childhood. And evidently had zero idea there was any issue about this until the sister was crying saying 'she'd worked so hard to separate herself from them to her friends'. Because people all seemed to like her and chatting to her and listening to her stories.\n\nLike, the sister is an adult at this point, there's no excuse for not self developing and telling a ton of lies, so that even your closest friends don't know you have siblings, and thinking that ruse will just stick forever and nobody will find out. These things will ALWAYS come crashing down eventually. OP isn't the AH for unknowingly being the one to bring the web of lies down by telling fun stories about growing up.\n\nIf the sister has issues, at that age, it's up to her to address them because OP clearly had no idea she felt that way. She's keeping in touch with her parents and having her party at the parent's house.. like what did she expect to happen? It's the siblings themselves she seems to have an issue with which is why she never even directly invited them. It sounds like the party was deliberately arranged when they were away also, and they just happened to come back and the parents invited their other kids also not knowing how the sister felt.\n\nShe was at her own engagement party for goodness sake. She should've been focusing on that and enjoying that, instead of being jealous people were having fun listening to her siblings tell stories. Evidently nobody in the family knows she feels that way because they aren't mind readers and rather than telling them, she's just distanced herself from them to the point of not inviting them to her engagement event over perceived childhood wrongs. She needs to grow up.", "How did she lie? OP doesn't say that she lied. Only that when he grew up, the parents spent more time with him and his friends.", "Two things can be true at once.

OP is then born and parents have quit work and have time to attend to them. \"Golden children\" makes sense", "Opposite in my family. I'm the youngest and only girl and I was largely overshadowed by my brothers and used at the scapegoat. We had very different childhoods. My brothers are 5, 7, and 9 years older than me and in my father's eyes, they can do wrong.

And my mom. And then my brother too. And then all of us. \n\nStill, I can see how an elder girl might have felt burdened with a lot of responsibility.\n\nI think it's the small details of OP entertaining a whole crowd, with stories he knew directly opposed what his sister's friends believed... and of \"I felt like I made some new friends\".\nTo me, that reads so oblivious, it wouldn't surprise me OP has never picked up any nuances of his sister's experience.", "Hard same. My sister was only a year younger than me but she got away with *way* more than I ever would have even dreamed of trying.

In our case it didn't even have to do with how our parents treated us but came out of the fact that they moved into a new neighborhood belonging to a different school district between us starting schools.\n\nBoth my younger siblings went to school with middle class kids living pre-dominantly in houses. I went to school with lower income apartment kids with frequently unemployed parents.\n\nJust 2 years apart but very different environments. My sisters never noticed my friends couldn't afford to go to the cinema or that I never got invited to a friend's summer house. Ofc I noticed that my sisters got to do tons more fun stuff with their friends.\n\nThey still talk about how \"we grew up\" because they didn't notice the differences. They don't know my class had an extra assistent whose sole purpose was to break up fights. They don't know I never had a proper math teacher nor science teacher before high school (the one we had the longest was an unemployed actor).", "Yep my adopted uncle got kicked out at 15. It was an extremely abusive household for my uncle  but not so much for his youngers bros. In the end my uncle found out his mom got him from an older alcoholic and probably not consenual.\n\nHis lil bro asked him why he left home at 15. He said; i got kicked out\n\nHis bro was completely surprised and suddenly remembered my uncle got daily beatings, cigs&bottles thrown at him and the verbal humiliation", "It could even be unintentional favoritism. Three boys, two twins and one born barely a year before. That takes up a lot of parental attention. In all likelihood the three brothers shared friends, making it easier to set up play dates, do carpooling, and getting to know people. Especially if the boys shared enough interests to be treated as a group.\n\nMeanwhile, you have the older girl. She\u2019s not one of \u2018the triplets\u2019 so that automatically creates distance. She has a completely different friend group, different interests, different needs. So she feels ostracized. \n\nAnd, because the \u2018triplets\u2019 take so much attention, she feels like she doesn\u2019t get any/enough. The triplets individually may even get the same attention as her, but because they can often be treated as a group, she effectively gets less. \n\nTo put it another way, parents are being fair and each child gets one play date for one weekend a month. So parents set up a play date for daughter. Daughter gets her one play date. Then parents arrange for Boy A to have a play date. But since they share friends, boys B and C also get a play date along with A. So the boys get three effective play dates a month.\n\nYou can put that to just about anything else. It\u2019s entirely possible that sister technically got the same as her brothers individually, but the brothers got more collectively. And the brothers never noticed an issue, since they never really hit a point of being unhappy with being treated as a group.", "I was left out of a lot of family activities with my cousins as a child growing up. I struggle connecting with my cousins and I often feel socially awkward because of that exclusion as a child. I tend to avoid social situations that aren\u2019t required or expected attendance at this point of my life.\n\nI am so much more comfortable around my bf\u2019s family for some reason. I\u2019m still quiet but they actually talk to me and make an effort whereas my family pretty ignores me in social situations. \n\nMy brother recently had been on a sort of social protest but I\u2019m pretty sure now his relationship with the rest of our family is beyond repair.

Every so often she does a vanishing act, tells social services she doesn't want her family to know where she is, last time it was because her neighbours phoned the police for a welfare check because the stench coming from her flat made them think she'd died in there. The police asked her dad to come when they went in case she needed support/was alive but distressed. She put it all on her twitter account that she thinks no-one know about, saying that her dad lied to the police to get them to come so he could shout at her (?!), she lied that her grandfather died of covid (he died of cancer) and no-one told her (they did, thats how she knew to put it on twitter), fundraised for money to go to his funeral (despite that her mum offered to pay for her transport and hotel costs to see him before he died - she didn't go to see him and she didn't go to the funeral, but she took strangers' money, and rang her mum to ask if her grandad had left her any money because she'd run out of cigarettes), she regularly posts about how hard up she is for money, every time there's any extreme weather of any description she posts that it has cut off her electric and her freezer totally defrosted - usually within 4-6 hours - and she needs money for a food shop, or her electricity is being cut off, or her Internet is being cut off. I think her purse \"got stolen\" 3 times in 6 months - she's not used that one in a while so I'm waiting for that one to come out again.

My parents PREACHED equality in all things when we were growing up, no favoritism in how much financial help we'd all get, everyone would have the same chances and opportunities, blah blah blah. I mean, they really beat it into us. I knew I was in a deficit for most things, but generally it was experiences and more intangible stuff like just being nice to me. I'd kinda written it off until I had asked for help paying for school and they balked because i decided to go mid 20s instead of at 17 and I dropped it. Then I found out how much middle sibling was getting per semester and I just lost it. I actually made a list line for line everything my siblings got that I didn't, I even gave grace in areas that I knew were because I just missed the boat on because my parents made better money later when I was out of the house already. But maaaannnnnnn did they go white when I quoted back all of the things they told us growing up, they were both on the losing end in their families because other siblings were favorites and so many stories of how hurt they had been emotionally or behind the eight ball financially for not being treated equally. Most of the emotional and experience and parenting style stuff they still won't cop to even with proof. But for about 5 years now my siblings and I keep a basic tally to make sure we're all being treated fairly financially. I'm lucky to have siblings that care enough that we back each other. For us it's just forcing them to keep their word after preaching about it for so long.

If her siblings are still blaming her for what happened as kids then there's really no way that they're supportive, understanding, or even a little empathetic. In a similar situation I'd probably be tempted to come up with the same stories she did just for the sake of simplicity and not having to constantly delve into that trauma when connecting with friends over upbringing and family history. Honestly, reading into it deeper it doesn't even seem like she outright lied it sounds more like she just said very little. Not talking about siblings can certainly seem like she might be an only child, the reaction from her friends sounds like she never mentioned one way or another and they made an assumption. Just saying she didn't have a good relationship with her parents because they worked a lot is way easier than going into the muck of her full experience. That would make a lot more sense as the reality of how she discussed her family when this party was hosted in her parents house. If she had said outright she was an only child I imagine there would be worse feelings than just slight confusion among her friends, because to be fair that's a pretty big lie to tell. These siblings have a lot to unpack, individually and together. And seriously, I hope so many good things for big sis.

Also, my experience with my siblings being willing to be understanding of our differences in experience is an exception to the general rule. Op already blames their sister for being isolated when they were kids. If a wall was built between them by circumstance before any of them could be understanding of each other then I'd be surprised younger siblings would've reacted well to that statement.

But my mom over compensated and my dad bought her love with money she was never told no when it came to things so she made my spoiled behind look like nothing \ud83d\ude02 but I still feel bad for my little sister she may have gotten all the materialistic things but she didn't get the memories like I did and now that my dad passed away November 1st 2021 I feel like I got the best version of a perfect childhood and it breaks my heart for my sister.

It was her party but it sounds like you made it about you, which must pretty much be her experience about your childhood too. You mention you are 25, 22, 21 and 21. You do realize there is an age gap there that means that you might have had an entirely different childhood experience and gotten entirely different versions of your parents? \n\nEver since she can remember, your parents have been revolved around you younger siblings. When she was five, you were 2, 1 and 1 - parents really had their hands on and a five year old could easily feel overlooked. She had to be the big sister, to set an example, be the bigger person, look after you, help clean up. She never got to be just a child like you did.\n\nWhen she was ten, you were 7, 6, 6. Same thing except now she might be expected to \"help out\", and by that I mean parentified, which is awfully common for for the oldest girl childs in families. While you always had you brothers for company and help, she might have felt like she had no one, not even her parents as they were looking after you.\n\nYour childhood was not the same and you didn't have the same version of your parents. So she never lied and you're an AH for implying it.", "Funny how those who receive the favoritism so often don't see it. Dude, you're clueless and you owe your sister an apology. Sounds like you didn't live the same childhood she did.", "Gonna go with a soft YTA because your intentions weren\u2019t malicious, but you could\u2019ve been more tactful. I\u2019d love to hear your sister\u2019s side to this story.", "YTA", "Doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything wrong BUT you do need to consider that your parents may have treated your sister differently especially as the oldest and only girl. It can sadly be very common for some parents to prefer parenting boys and support them more for extra curricular activities. Her experience literally could have been different and YTA for stating they were lies without talking to her more.", "I never really discuss my family because I've always been more of a private person. I love my family, but they aren't my first priority for a variety of reasons. If I'm asked, then of course, I mention parents and a younger sister. That's about it, though. It's not about lying. It's because I don't think that info is anyone else's business. Unless we're close friends and confidants. Similarly, if others volunteer info about their families, then that's fine. If they don't, I take that as a cue that they don't want to discuss family. That's also fine.\n\nMy life experience shares some similarities to OP's sister in that my much younger sister was the \"golden child.\" We also have a sizable age gap between us, so our upbringings and perspectives differ significantly.\n\nOP, I feel that YTA here because you seem to be minimizing your sister's lived experience. It's telling that she refers to you all as the golden children. I'm certain that's a spot on take.", "YTA There was no need to do or say anything.  All I see is you assuming your sister had the same experience you did growing up and assuming you know what she has said to people.  So she didn\u2019t talk about you.  So what?", "YTA", "YTA. If you actually had a relationship with her, which you clearly don\u2019t, you\u2019d have asked her about it. But you decided to paint yourself and your brothers how you wanted to, to make yourself look good, because she must have said and/or implied many times that her childhood wasn\u2019t nice or positive for her. \n\nIt\u2019d be awesome for her if you got your head out of your ass and actually listen to why she did what she did.", "YTA\n\nThere is so much more going on here and it sounds like you don't give a shit how your sister feels", "YTA Children can grow up in the same home and have completely different experiences. Her childhood experience was completely different from yours. The oldest girl child will always have a different experience. Instead of dropping stories, maybe talk to her about what she was okay sharing with people in her life that you don\u2019t know.", "YTA and clearly the golden child", "Woah woah woah, she mentioned golden children. Imma go on a limb and say yta. It seems like this post leaves out a bunch of context that would make you an ah.", "YTA  - I am 6 years older than my brother. His experiences and mine are very different.  I grew up taking care of him,  cooking dinners,  cleaning,  etc, while both parents worked. At 14 i had to find my own rides home from events because i was old enough to.  He grew up with both parents at his events. \n\nIf you wanted to talk about this,  you should have done so later with your sister,  not at her party.", "Seems as though your parents invested all of their free love and time into their youngest 3 and she felt as though she wasn't as valued. Have you ever stopped to think that she could possibly have had a different experience than you? I'm sure if my parents favored my siblings my entire life, I wouldn't want to have to discuss them with my friends more than I had to. The fact that you decided to pull a crowd and overshadow her even at her own engagement party is wild. If it was a concern to you, I don't understand why you couldn't have just resolved the situation with her in private like a normal person. I feel for her, genuinely. From what I can gather, yta. I hope one day you can talk through things and attempt to connect with her.", "YTA. It sounds like there are reasons she spun her childhood the way she did.", "YTA and so are your brothers for infinity.  How do you tell you\u2019re the golden child without telling you\u2019re the golden child?  Go to your sister\u2019s engagement party even though she didn\u2019t want you there.  Then start telling stories loud enough for her friends to gather around you.  Finish it off by having a great time and making new friends while she cries that you have once again shoved her aside.", "YTA. Your sister's life isn't about you. It is so not about you that she doesn't even talk about you to her friends. Because you're the kind of person that gets mad that someone else's engagement party isn't centered on you. You and your brothers decided that *the least important part of your sister's life was your sister* and everyone had to hear about the REAL MVP's in the family, you. And you're also the kind of person who doesn't understand that the eldest child has the least amount of freedom or 1x1 parent time, because they're always having to take care of or scale back for their younger siblings. I hope she is able to have a wedding without you ruining that for her, too.", "YTA. Your childhood experiences were clearly different and you don't seem to have the capacity to even notice. She didn't lie. She just didn't talk about you. Which is apparently something you're not used to, since you even made her engagement party about YOU. Golden child indeed.", "Is this as bad as it sounds? Did you make an engagement party about yourself? A crowd of people, with you telling stories about yourselves to her friends?\n\nYeah, sorry. YTA. Her experience can be perfectly different than yours and still be valid. This was pretty selfish and entitled of you.", "YTA. \n\nYou saw yourself drawing a crowd at your sister's party and didn't excuse yourself and that's plain rude. \n\nYou do not steal the spotlight from someone else's event. \n\nIt's not quite as bad as proposing to someone at a wedding, but it's in the same vein.", "YTA. It's her engagement party and her friends. Rather than contradict and invalidate her experience, you could have recognized that she felt differently about childhood than you, and not spend the entire party talking about yourself.", "YTA. Like I thought right away and others have said, your experience probably wasn\u2019t the same as hers. That is all there is to it. The party probably mostly had her future in-laws and friends that you don\u2019t have much to do with (especially living across the country) but you had to insert yourself into a situation you don\u2019t know about, ruining an event that isn\u2019t yours. Selfish all the way through. Then you are even asking why she is upset. With brothers like that, who would want to claim you.", "After reading comments, I\u2019m gonna say yes, YTA. \n\nI grew up much like your sister did. However I was the youngest, but I was always excluded from my older siblings friends, activities, and extracurriculars. Reading your post only shows that you\u2019re thinking about yourself and your brothers, and not the fact that you didn\u2019t even question internally how your sister might\u2019ve felt to make part of her childhood disappear. You call it \u201cuncovering her lies\u201d, but honestly? she was burying a part of her life that made her feel bad about herself. You were there, regardless if you live there or not, to celebrate your sister getting engaged and starting a wonderful new chapter in her life. And you in turn made it about you, y\u2019all\u2019s past\u2026 and for what???? What did YOU gain out of this? Outing her for feeling a certain type of way about her childhood? Was this something that EVERYONE needed to know? At her ENGAGEMENT PARTY? Smh.", "YTA", "YTA-As the oldest sister myself, I can see how your sisters life xould be exactly what she said. Your parents may have completely ignored her, and gave her the \"eldest daughter\" treatment. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar, we're forced to grow up quick, raise our siblings, and tend to be the child that teaches parents how to parent. After the first, its always common to see the younger siblings be treated better, and have more time with the parents as they get older.\n\nIn my own experience, my mom and dad worked all the time to.make ends meet. Multiple jobs as well. Id also go to their work and sit when someone couldn't watch me. Once my sister was born (I was 8 or 9) my mom had lost her job and was a STAH mom for the first few years of her life. Once my brother was born (I was 17) she began to work again, and once I came home from school she left for work, and I was a babysitter until the evening. Now, she again a STAHM and is involved heavily in my brother and sisters life, always takes them where they need to go, and have no issues. \n\nYou may not know what your sister went through seperately, especially with the larger age gap between all of you and her.", "YTA and you know it. You enjoyed humiliating her.", "YTA you stole the spotlight and didn\u2019t mind.", "YTA They weren\u2019t \u201clies\u201d but her perception of reality vs what the boys experienced.  You come across as very arrogant and not very observant of others experiences.  You should leave her alone and stay away from her friends.", "Yes, YTA. Wtf? This is the kind of behavior that probably prompted that. Even if she was an asshole, which at this point you have no idea why she said that, this is still wildly inappropriate and incredibly upsetting on her special day.", "YTA. First off you question if you were invited to the party so clearly you\u2019re not close with sister or there\u2019s some issue there. Then you admit that she was reclusive and not as integrated with the family growing up. Lastly, you more or less make her look like a liar at her own party. You owe her an apology. Just because she has a different perspective on your childhood than you doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s her experience and her feelings. Try getting to know why she feels that way before passing judgement.", "Yta. There is a time and place and that wasn\u2019t the time. I can see why she called you the golden child. My brother (middle child) was the golden child. If you hear it from him our grandparents were amazing. However me (the youngest) and my other brother( the oldest) and cousins (same ages like my oldest brother) can speak differently about them.

Lol I'm not close with one of my siblings but we acknowledge each other's existence. Don't you feel bad at all? Doesn't that bother you! It seems like it doesn't. Weird dynamics going on in your family, you seem oblivious to it but it's pretty fucking odd.", "YTA.. well im on the fence about \u201casshole\u201d because you could be ignorant about the fact that we all have our own personal reality we live in.. so the perspective YOU grew up from is like completely worlds away from anyone you know.. \n\nIncluding your sisters.. \n\nIt\u2019s a good rule of thumb as an adult.. to not try to push your reality on someone elses.. minimizing the emotions someone feels is wrong, and if your sister felt these emotions you\u2019re in the wrong for suggesting she didnt.. \n\nTwo people can be in the same room and be experiencing other side of the spectrum emotions.", "YTA, you gloss over that this was her engagement party, you don't mention her fiance in any of this post, and it sounds like you worked to soak up the attention that wasn't yours to soak up.

Maybe she had a completely different childhood than you and your brothers did because she is the oldest (or bc of other possible reasons). I\u2019m just assuming, but I\u2019ve seen so many parents raise their children in incredibly different ways that there is a likely possibility that, from her perspective, everything she said is true.\n\nTry to talk to her to understand why she said all of that to her friends", "YTA - I\u2019d bet money that your sister DID have a vastly different childhood.

So used to being the centre of attention that you can't handle the fact that your sister simply doesn't like to talk about her childhood/family with her new friends. You'd rather call her a liar than accept that she doesn't have nice things to say about you so she keeps quiet.\n\nNo child just self-isolates for no reason. Have you ever considered why she pulled away? Or have you always blamed her for her lack of inclusion?\n\nIt sounds to me like she had a very different childhood than you did, that she felt so disregarded and excluded that she pulled away so she didn't have to live it constantly. If your parents were wrangling 3 unruly boys, constantly chaperoning you to sport, hosting your friends, etc., when did they have time to bond with her? Or did all of you expect her to insert herself into your well-laid schedule if she wanted any parental attention?\n\nNow she's building a life for herself and doesn't like to talk about a painful past. So.. you invited yourself to her engagement party, got bent out of shape over the fact that her life doesn't revolve around you anymore and made her special day about you and your brothers, essentially outing her as a 'liar' by disagreeing with her account of her own childhood.. at her own party (that you weren't invited to)?\n\nSeriously? I know you're young, but you need to grow up. \n\nJust because you had a wonderful childhood, doesn't mean she did. Just because you like to talk about your childhood and overshare, doesn't mean she does. You had no right to attempt to change her friendship dynamic, re-write history or ruin her engagement party. Surely it occurred to you that speaking up on topics she stayed quiet about would upset her? But you thought it okay because you felt wronged and you ruined her once-in-a-lifetime event. Even if she invites you to the wedding out of some sense of obligation, I think you should consider not going because you just can't help yourself.

You sound resentful towards her, even calling her a liar.

Which, given why those stories were of interest, was basically calling your sister a liar at her engagement party, where I imagine it was not just her friends but her fiance's too.

It sounds like you're more upset about protecting the family then you are about your sister feeling the way she does. Feelings aren't right or wrong. How we re see pond to them can be. You could say, well, everything was great, except for my sister.  So that means everything wasn't great. Maybe there's something you've missed. Especially in busy households, everybody tends to get wrapped up in their own things. It's hard to imagine someone living in the same household, same parents, having a totally different experience.  But trust me, they do.\n\nThe main reason I feel YTA is that you took your sister to trial, found her guilty, and sentenced her without even talking to her. That alone is a sign of a toxic environment. No communication. \n\nI hear you placing a lot of blame on her, for not getting in touch. How often did you call her during the pandemic? Was she invited to all of your events? I don't know, but these are things you should examine.\n\nWhat's her relationship with your parents? There's a hint of family scapegoat here, but like I said, limited knowledge. \n\nThe fact you chose such a public display to out your sister, because you were hurt, or angry, etc, shows a very low level of empathy, and poor coping skills.  You jumped to conclusions and acted.\n\nYou should've talked to your sister, in private, about your feelings. If this is something you don't do, or nobody in your family does, then there may be real issues you choose to ignore, and she may be the family truth teller. There is such a thing as toxic positivity. Even though trying to stay positive in situations is good, it can become a way of blinding ourselves to reality.

I personally would never embarrass my brother like that in front of his friends at any party,  let alone his engagement, even if he said something nuts like our parents were werewolves.   \nThere is a reason your sister told the story she did, even if theres no truth to it. Your job should have been concern and trying to figure out why she felt the need to.  Focus less on trying to win over HER friends with an interesting & engaging story and think about how you're damaging her credibility in her friends eyes with every \"wow she told that wrong!\" story you tell. It was her engagement party and you seemingly made it about winning over her friends and calling her a liar in the process- and not even checking in with her yourself? \"Apparently she was crying\"... so you heard from a third party she was upset? dude.   \nSounds like you've been stealing her friends and being cool and loved in her stead your whole life while completely disregarding her feelings & experience.

It would also fit with her wanting to stay home when they all had practice - she would have appreciated the calm and quietness of her own home.", "Also, the person says \"me and my two brothers\" and never mentions whether they themselves are a brother or a sister.

He made the dumbest choices and just did the worst things but he was forgiven at every turn and was basically given a little slap on the wrist. Meanwhile, I haven\u2019t even done a quarter of the things he has but I get criticized and ridiculed at every turn.

If his sister was trying to get sympathy, she could have stuck far closer to the likely truth of \u201cmy brothers had a fantastic childhood, they were popular and my parents attended all their sports games. I was never given the same amount of attention, and was mostly on the sidelines because I wasn\u2019t athletic and my interests were naturally seen as less important. My parents did attend some of my awards ceremonies, but only if they didn\u2019t clash with my brother\u2019s sport events, and often one would attend while the other supported my brothers.

You have no clue about the potential damage you\u2019ve caused, at an event that was supposed to be a celebration of your sister\u2019s milestone. Somehow, you managed to make yourself centre of attention on a day dedicated to her, which gives me a good idea of how her childhood likely played out. \n\nYou\u2019ve said yourself that your sister often wasn\u2019t the one with friends over, it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s ever made friends as easily as you do.

Please ask yourself whether your sister was actually \u201clying\u201d or whether she was leaning on a white lie to hide a much more painful truth. Take a second to imagine a childhood in which you had 3, close, academically gifted sisters who\u2019s weekly commitments to debate club, after school classes etc were always celebrated and attended by your parents. They tried their best to attend your sports commitments, but only if they didn\u2019t clash with one of your sister\u2019s events.

My parents also were not around when I was a child but my brothers did not see it worth to try and help take care of me so I was just alone. They would gaslight me for years about my childhood and how it was not that bad. How did they know? They were never there.", "Really hate this happened to you and others on here. Parents should treat their kids equal. Hope every one is ok!", "One thing that sticks out in my childhood is the fact that I had my best friend and her boyfriend in my basement bedroom when I was eighteen and my mother yelled at me about having a boy in bedroom. Yet, my sister, who is 6 years younger than me got pregnant at 16.", "My mother hated my undercut. The rest of my hair was chin length when I had my way. Anyways, she fucking hated that haircut and we fought about all 4 years of high school. After graduation, I let I go and just grew my hair. Then, I was going to see my favorite band that November. So, I cut my hair, and my mother lost her mind. She ended up throwing me out. They took me back in a month and a half later after I had pretty much hit rock bottom. Then I moved out permanently 5 months later.\n\n\nSo, not long after I moved out, I went to visit and my younger brother had the exact same hair that got me kicked out.  When I noticed, I blurted out something about her being fine with his hair like that. The only reply was my father quickly telling me to shut my fucking mouth and looking like he could kill me.\n\n\n\nThat's how my house rolled. I walked everywhere because my dad got pissy every time I asked for a ride. My dad went out of his way to get my brother where he wanted to be. Like I never once got a ride my first two years of high school. Then my dad started driving my brother as soon as he started.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not a good time.", "This was the big 'ol red flag for me too", "An old therapist told me a big part of her business was il treated sisters", "This is completely relatable.", "I see you have met my parents", "There\u2019s also the age gap, with her being 4 years older than OP were their parents working a lot more hours trying to get established when she was younger. Like maybe they worked a lot of hours until she was 9/10 or would bring work home in the evening when she supposedly had time with them after the younger kids went to bed.  And then maybe the relationship wasn\u2019t as strong from her side.", "Break the news to the parents about the pregnancy, I'm guessing.", "> I know my parents often tell stories of how much fun it was to raise us all so close in age, but that the first two years or so were particularly hard.\n\nThose were not the first two years or so. The first two years or so happened *before you were born*. Yes, I know what you're saying - but if your parents are using this phrasing, or anything like it, dollars to donuts your sister is thinking the same thing I just said.\n\nIt's good that you're listening to people, and open to listening to your sister, *really* listening to her. And if you'll take my advice, listening means *listening*. If you're spending your time thinking of your response and how to defend yourself and your parents, or justify their actions, then you're not actually paying attention to what she's saying. Listen first, affirm her feelings (even if you're not sure about the facts - but don't say that part!), think about it later. Do not confuse listening with arguing. Those are two different things. If, upon reflection, you decide that you disagree with her on some point or another you can always tell her *later* if it seems important.\n\nQuestion (you don't have to actually answer it on this thread, but see if you can answer it in your own head for yourself): Do your parents tell as many stories of the first two years of your sister's life as they do about those two hectic years after you were born? Do they tell as many stories about *her* as they tell about the three of you?\n\n> my brothers and I were attached at the hip and an activity for one was an activity for all, like you said. \n\nIt was not an activity for all. It was an activity for the three of you.\n\nWhich also - honestly, I don't think that was the healthiest thing for you and your brothers either. I think your parents would've done better to make more of an effort to encourage you to develop your own individual interests. \n\nWhat would've happened if one of you had decided you didn't like ice hockey anymore? That you wanted to do something totally different, like dance or fencing or bouldering or joining a writing club, something that your brothers weren't interested in?", "Definitely talk to her, and try to keep an open mind. It's difficult to reconcile different experiences of the same thing sometimes, but unfortunately it's not uncommon for one sibling to feel quite different from the other(s). Good luck!", "And fucking apologize to her.\n\nYou got on a soap box at HER engagement party, that you just happened to be in town for, and not directly invited, and told all her friends she was full of shit because you couldn't comprehend that her childhood was different to yours. \n\n\"I know my parents often tell stories of how much fun it was to raise us all so close in age\" you do realise this did not include her right?\n\nYou've likely done some irreparable damage to her friendships and trust circle.", "you got a lot of (apparently valid) criticizm in here (and various garbage takes and 'creative interpretations' as well, as is tradition 'round here) but I'd like to commend that you seem to start to understand how your sister likely has a quite different perspective on your childhoods and that now you at least are trying to make an effort to understand and connect. \n\nwhen you talk to her and listen to her perspective keep in mind that this isn't about judging her pov being 'right or wrong' but first about understanding how she feels and why.", "Sounds like you have great siblings", "Did you forget that Pidyon Bechor is a thing? If done correctly it can really feel like you are working to get your son back", "My brother admits this too because he somehow grew up to be a decent person despite the way my father\u2019s family tried to mold him. Ultimately, I don\u2019t envy him because they were also putting a lot of pressure on him as the heir. \n\nMy sister and I were just invisible."]}
