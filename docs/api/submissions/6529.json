Husband(M45) and I are completely new to this, so I've spent the last 5 months trying to get him to all of his rehearsals, extra practices, and any team building activities that comes our way. It's been challenging, especially when we learn about some events barely 24 hours before hand.\n\nYesterday I got an email telling us the dance troupe my son's troupe feeds into was doing a preseason show free to the public tonight, but it was at the same time as my kids' church youth night. Julian really wanted to go because they are well known for putting on amazing shows, but with one car we can't be in two places at once. I asked my husband if we could go to the show as a family since the kids' church activity wasn't anything important, especially since some people are still out of town for the holidays. He was torn because he's very devout, but ultimately decided we'd all go to the dance show together.\n\nAs I was asking people to get ready, my oldest, Jason(M16), asked if he could stay home because he wanted to relax on his last day of vacation. He also said he wasn't very interested in seeing people dance since it isn't really his thing and it wasn't like Julian would be dancing, he'd be watching like the rest of us. I thought those were all fair points so I told him to go talk to dad. Well, dad didn't agree and told him he needed to go because it was a family outing. \n\nHere's where I may have been the AH; I asked my husband to skip his church thing so we could see the show instead as a family, then as we were trying to leave Jason asked to stay home. When my husband said no, I sided with Jason because, again, Julian wasn't dancing, we were all just watching. Since we had about 2 minutes to decide or we would be late, I told Jason to stay home but finish a couple of small chores while we were gone. He agreed and put his shoes away while my husband was still arguing that this was a family outing.\n\nAITA for letting Jason stay home against my husband's wishes?\n\nAdded note: I've become jaded to my husband's pleas about doing things as a family, because he wants to make every event a family thing. Ex; every errand, all tv shows and movies, every card/board game to the point it has created more fights than actually bringing us together.

Quality time is important, but you need reasonable expectations.  Growing up, my family generally ate dinner together unless someone had a conflict (practice or class or whatever) and generally had 1-2 quality time things per week (a movie or a game or whatever), and we had 1 half hour show we usually watched together.  IME, that\u2019s a pretty normal amount of family time.  It sounds like your husband is trying to force a lot more than that, and everyone but him is chafing badly under his demands.", "NTA your son very politely asked for a break from people. Your husband needs to get a grip!", "NTA. Family time is important, but he's old enough to sit things out that he's not interested in doing.", "NTA but it sounds like you need marriage therapy. It is ridiculous that your husband wants to do EVERYTHING together. Could you and your son have found a friend to drive to the show or could your husband have found a carpool to church?", "NTA\n\nNot forcing a 16 year old to go to a dance performance that no one in the family is involved in makes sense.", "NTA - Family is important, so is independence. Your teenage son can miss a dance show.", "NTA.\n\nMy word, constant family outings sounds suffocating. Older kids need a break sometimes. It's not like this was a family vacation that was planned in advanced.", "NTA.  Not every \"family outing\" has to include the entire family.", "NTA. 16 is old enough to make some of his own decisions and I don't see this as an unreasonable request. IMO.", "NTA but there seems to be much deeper issues here. Your husband insist on doing everything as a family together? It's reasonable that the oldest wants some alone time. If family time was rare, I could see his frustration but the way you describe how he handled it still makes me solid in my NTA ruling. \n\nYour husband seems to be quite controlling of the whole family which is not going to bode well for raising teenagers. I'm glad you are standing up for your son because you are his parent too.", "NTA- but you cannot keep just going on with this and \"dealing\" with it as it comes up. you need to actually talk to your husband about the issues even if you have before. chances are he just is worried, one day the kids will be grown up and not spending time with you anymore he might be acting silly but for a good reason. you need to see both sides of this situation and talk through how you both feel.", "NTA - plans changed and your oldest had a reasonable request.  Spending time together as a family is important, but that\u2019s not the same as attending events (of disinterest to some) as a unit.", "Why did you tell him to ask his dad if you weren't going agree with you husband if he said he needed to come?", "No, absolutely NTA. If anything, you are bending over backwards to please too many people at once. Everyone should be allowed to choose what they attend at a certain age. If it's really a problem with your husband, maybe you guys can try to set aside certain days as \"whole family\" days, and other days as \"each person does their thing\" days, especially as more events come into each child's life. Also, get a schedule from the dance troupe, talk to them about being more communicative about their events ahead of time. They should understand that people have lives, and not everyone can work events into their schedule with only 24hrs notice. Also, not to sound rude, but you shouldn't tell your kid to ask his dad for permission if you're going to undermine it anyway.", "I'm going with ESH,  your mistake was telling him to go ask his dad.  You know dad is hung up on doing everything as a family, so would likely insist he go.  Do you kinda created your own problems. Next time just make a decision solo and let the 16 year old stay home.  He is old enough to decide some things on his own, anyway.", "NTA.\n\nJason wanted to relax during his vacation, which is commendable. Your husband wanted to indulge his religious delusions, which is pathetic.\n\nIf your husband wants to do more \"family\" activities then perhaps you ought to buy him a doll house and some dolls. It sounds like he's absolutely stifling to be around, like he has no personality beyond \"church\" and \"family\".", "NAH.  It seems like you made a decision based on what you thought was best for your family in the moment. It's understandable that you would want to prioritize your son's dance troupe show, especially since he and his cohorts seem to have put so much time and effort into it, and he wants to support that (and you want to support him). \n\nIt's also understandable that Jason would want to stay home and relax on his last day of vacation, especially if he is not particularly interested in dance. The only issue *might be* when you deferred to his father, then when he said no, you wrested the authority back and undermined him a bit.  You thought was best for your family at the time, but it was not a very cool way to do it--but that doesn't take you to AH territory, IMHO.\n\nWhy not consider your husband's perspective and try to find a way to compromise if possible?  Did DH's family life when growing up have \"family time\", or did he lack it? It sounds like he values family time and wants to make sure that everyone is included in family activities. It might be helpful to have a conversation with him about why it's so important, and finding a balance between his desire for family togetherness and your and your other children's interests and needs.\n\n>Added note: I've become jaded to my husband's pleas about doing things as a family, because he wants to make every event a family thing. Ex; every errand, all tv shows and movies, every card/board game to the point it has created more fights than actually bringing us together. My other kids were also arguing that Jason should stay home.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to try to make decisions together, that are fair and that take into account the needs and wants of all members of the family. If you keep this up (being jaded to DH's pleas), that *would* make you ultimately TA.", "NAH\n\nEverybody's opinion was fine.  But need to have a calm conversation with your husband, verses letting the frustration aggravate you.  \n\nSounds like you have a nice family who all love and support each other. Giving your son some extra chores was a good thinking on your part - he got to do what he wanted to do in return for being productive.  \n\nIt's great your husband wants the whole family together but he needs to understand that as the kids get older they're going to want a little more private time, and their interests are going to start to veer in different directions.   The two of you can set some ground rules for 'family time' ie what type of events are EVERYBODY and what the exceptions might be.  Talk to all the kids so everybody is on the same page.", "ESH. Do you exist in a Hallmark Movie Universe?", "NTA. Let the kid stay home sheesh, kid is 16 husband needs to stop trying to imprison the family into doing everything together", "ESH. I say this because there really isn't an option for you and your husband to be AH but not everyone else. The children are not AH here, just you and your husband. You for telling your oldest to ask dad, then undermine the decision. Your husband is an AH for pushing \"family time\" on everyone all the time. You need couples counseling and possibly family counseling. My guess is that your husband is pushing family time because he's aware that in two short years his oldest will no longer be around, and same for your 14 yo except it's four short years there. You and your husband really need to sit down and TALK. He needs to let you (and likely your kids) know why he's pushing for so much family time. You need to tell him that his pushing family time is only putting a strain on the interfamily relationships, and he needs to ease up and let go of it some otherwise he's going to cause rifts which will send at least one child away with minimal contact in the future.", "You're NTA. 16 year old kids need space and breathing room. Spending the evening home alone was not an unreasonable request. \n\nOn one hand, it probably would have been better to discuss it privately with your husband, but I am gathering from your additional comments that there wasn't time for that. But on the other hand, it seems like such a minor thing it really shouldn't even need discussion.", "NTA The church thing wasn't your husband's thing; it was a youth group activity. In any event, logistics is the reason you couldn't go, whereas there was no logistical hurdle for Jason to stay home.", "YTA. For going against your husband after you told Jason to ask him. If you were going to make the decision anyway... Why ask dad? So you could undermine his decision?", " YTA. You overruled your husband after having your son ask him if he could stay home. What was the purpose if you were just gonna let him stay home regardless? I understand your older son wanting to stay home and that's fine. I think though, that you should step back and reflect. There are many wives and children who would love to have a husband/dad who wants to spend so much time as a family as your husband. You almost sound annoyed by it. Especially since you needed to add how he wants to make all outings a family thing. Should the family always have to do things together? Of coarse not. But you should sit down with your husband and explain your position. Also, in the future, don't have one of your children go and ask dad about something if it's not going to mean anything.", "ESH- you should have sided with dad if you asked Your son to ask his Father. I'm sure you strive for a united front most times but this wasn't one of them.\n\n\nHowever, you're right that you need to talk to your husband about everything being a group activity. What you seem to be experiencing is something my husband when through with his parents that ended up pulling them apart.\n\nHe's in his forties now and avoids \"family time\" like the plague because every family gathering is a way to guilt trip about more family gatherings and more family time. Meanwhile, his parents show no interest in his interests so why must he always cater to them? Even my SIL and I have tried to explain it's about quality time, not the quantity of time.\n\nPerhaps this is a conversation you should have with your husband first without the children and explain the level of resentment it can lead to/Harbour over time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
