If the others want to go so badly there are tickets they can buy. It may be on a 3rd party site for more than face value but it is what it is.

That's how it works.", "NTA- If you like the band too, this is just mean girl shit on your wife\u2019s part", "NTA, you bought your ticket, you are excited to be there, the other sister just popped out of nowhere .", "NTA- This is a d\\*ck move and one of the full grown adults going can drive them.

I\u2019d take my ticket and go alone.", "NTA.\n\nI would absolutely refuse to give my ticket up to one of these sisters. There's no way in hell that I would let the ticket did I paid for to go see an artist that I cared about get stolen and given to somebody else without any input from me.\nForget about the question about driving them to the show. I'd probably end up selling two of the tickets on Facebook marketplace or something and then go with my wife alone.", "NTA.\n\nIf they are all adults and know how to drive, then they should be able to take themselves, right?    Why are you suddenly their Uber driver?", "NTA. They can drive themselves and stay overnight at a hotel if they'll be drinking.

I'm surprised you're even talking.", "NTA.   \nThat was exceptionally rude.\n\nThey are adults, and can figure out their own way there. Enjoy your quiet night alone.", "NTA.

You have every right to be hurt and angry, and it's incomprehensible to me that after having the balls to cut you out, she also had the balls to expect you to drive them there and back.\n\nJust...no.\n\nNo, you would definitely not be the asshole. She owes you all sorts of apologies.", "NTA.  Who paid for the tickets?  If you own any of them, and I would assume at least 2 if you & wife bought out of joint funds, charge the street rate for resale of the ticket.  Go on vacay with a friend with your profit.\n\nYour wife is really inconsiderate here.  Ask her how she would feel if treated the same by you.", "NTA\n\nBut I am confused. How in the hell can your wife just make the command decision that you're not going?\n\nDo you allow her to dictate other aspects of your life too?", "NTA OP; it\u2019s your wife that\u2019s TA for cutting you out of the experience.", "NTA\n\nNo way would I go through the hassle and stress of getting my hands on tickets and then not attend. Your wife most certainly is the AH for suddenly dropping this on you, like it's okay to do. Did she give any indication that this was supposed to be for her and her sisters?", "How is she going to cut you out if you only give her three tickets? Yours is in youtmr wallet.", "NTA.  I'd be tempted to try and return your ticket or report it stolen, but that might end your marriage.

She should be really ashamed of herself for treating her husband that way.", "NTA.\n\nYou purchased the tickets because you wanted to see the artist. Then your wife decided she'd take the tickets to have a \"girls night out\". And then she wants you to drive them, wait for them, drive them back - and pay for it all, I guess.  That's... infuriating. Mean. Thoughtless at best.\n\nWhat about you deciding to take the tickets, inviting three male friends and making it a \"boys night out\"? Would she be ok with that? I mean, she would not even have to drive you, right?\n\nI mean, it's just tickets (although they are expensive), but how could she just decide she's going to disregard you the way she did? I would be furious. \n\n(Honestly, I see some red flags here: How is your wife comfortable in cutting you out from a concert you looked forward to attend? How is she demanding you drive her and her sisters to a concert you wanted to attend yourself? Does she even acknowledge you as a person or are you just the... I don't know... personal servant?)", "NTA\n\nShe's an adult.  She can drive herself.", "Absolutely NTA.", "have wife drive herself!  end of story\n\ngo out shooting pool with your buds", "NTA\n\nHow does she get to claim final say on who gets to use your ticket?

If it's you, tell your wife you're really glad her sisters were able to get her a ticket. If it's close to where you are, maybe you'll see her there!", "NTA. Then the others need to pony up for the cost of at least two tickets. Your wife doesn't get to give away a joint asset.\n\nBe honest, if you're cut, you're driving skills are cut too. If she's manipulative enough to give away your ticket then she's manipulative enough to get someone else to drive her.", "NTA. But take a ticket and go yourself. She and her sisters can figure out who gets the other tickets and how they are going to get there.   \n\n\nAlternatively, make wife and sisters pay for all the tickets. I\u2019d go for first option though. You want to see band.", "Does your wife always make the decisions?  Tell her, no. I\u2019m going, we have two spare tickets.    Was there anyone you wanted to invite? Why does she get to push you out? Do you have a backbone? Give her three tickets, you keep one.  Good grief.

In fact your wife needs to tell one of her sisters that they can\u2019t go. She was wrong to cut you from the trip.

Communicate directly to your wife that this is unacceptable.  You paid for the tickets with joint funds, and you will 100% not accept being cut out of going to the concert in favor of her sisters.  \n\nYou don't have to be angry, it's a better debate/conflict strategy that you stay calm.  Focus on how this makes you feel, not on whether she is right or wrong.  Make the point that you have just as much of a right to take the tickets yourself and bring a group of friends, cutting her out of going to the show.\n\nI don't know how your wife communicates with you, but you can armor yourself against insults or criticism by focusing on how this makes you feel and avoiding criticizing her.  If she criticizes or insults you, you can respond that your are telling her how you feel and that she has no right to judge your feelings.  Your feelings are not right or wrong, they are your feelings.  \n\nThis is, honestly, so outrageously offensive to you that I would not hesitate for a second to show up at the concert two hours before you know she plans to arrive and let yourself and three friends in with your digital tickets.  She can stand outside the venue wondering why the tickets are working while you enjoy the show.  If you don't have friends just sell the fucking things without her knowledge.  I'm serious.

Definitely tell her your feelings and that you'll be staying home that evening.  Even if one of the sisters can't go, I'd stay away.

If you were both fans, she should have known that", "YWNBTA.  I realize you don't want to read any \"does your wife not love you\" comments but, as much as I hate to ask, are you sure she really does?  If I were in your shoes I'd be doubtful.  I mean, you bent over backwards to get these tickets to see this band that you and your wife both love, with the understanding that you and she (and plus two) would attend, then at the last minute she drops the bomb on you that you're not going, her 3 sisters are.  But still wants you to drive them 4 hrs. over snow-covered highways?  And you'll do what while they're enjoying the concert?  That doesn't sound very loving to me.  After all, who's she married to ; you or her sisters?  Now it'd be one thing if you didn't care for this particular band and attending the concert didn't mean anything to you.  As it was, one of her sisters, who's not a fan, backed out so you could go.  I'm sorry, but it seems like your SIL loves you more than your wife does.  I suggest you have a VERY in-depth conversation with your wife, about a lot of things.  You and she have some soul-searching to do.  Good luck.", "INFO.  Why are you being asked to drive?  When is the concert?  Is your wife scared about driving in snow?

Driving 4 hours, after a concert, in the snow could be a recipe for disaster.", "NTA\n\nDude your wife sucks big time here. You guys are big fans and yall bought the tickets. Definitely don't drive them.\n\nYour wife is just totally being an ahole on this one.", "NTA. Tell her sorry, but you found three others that want to go with you.", "NTA, sorry your wife is so awful.  What makes her even think that she can steal your ticket in the first place?

Tell us again about all the hard work you did to get the presale code\u2026And if you think this has soured the experience for you (now that you are going since a sister declined), how about you show your wife this post, where you\u2019ve lied and had people say terrible things about her because of your lies.  Now you tell people their comments aren\u2019t cool?  Grow up.", "NTA. \n\nBut also is it really going to help at all?

Could you imagine how horrible you would feel about something happening to them all because you were excluded from the girls trip. You guys who agree with him are the problem.

Didn\u2019t you get tickets together? \nAre the sisters at least paying for their own?\nDoes your wife even like you ? \n Absolutely DO NOT chauffeur them to the concert , the absolute audacity to even suggest such a thing \ud83e\udd2f", "NTA - why can\u2019t one of them drive?? honestly lol i wanna know why between four adults, not one of them can drive to the concert. \n\nrude of your wife to cut you out also.", "Sounds like this husband is owed a vacation of his choosing and by himself.", "NTA. I absolutely would not be driving them if you were cut out.", "NTA\n\nYour wife on the other hand.....", "NTA. 2 non-Taylor fans getting the tickets over you is an injustice on top of just being a massive dick move from your wife whom you made plans with. It's extremely hard to get tickets, you got them, and they want to push you out from something that's probably $1k+ resale? Absolutely not. If they want to go, they can go buy resale tickets themselves.", "NTA.  That\u2019s really shitty of your wife.  I wouldn\u2019t be inclines to drive them either.", "So not only have you been told that you can\u2019t see the concert, your wife has also demanded you drive them to the event. \n\nI suggest you tell them that even if the ticket becomes available, you won\u2019t be driving them because the whole experience has left a nasty taste in your mouth. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife had you get 4 tickets, she knows you love the artist, and now you're not included.\n\nNope\n\nTell wife, sister night is off. Yiu & she have two tickets.\n\nThere are two remaining, who are we inviting!\n\nPeriod", "NTA you purchased the tickets for you, your wife and 2 other people. I'm the type of petty I would sell the other tickets and go by myself. However,  you have to live with your wife so that might not be a good idea.", "NTA - Did you actually buy the tickets?  I would tell your wife her sisters can source their own tickets if they want to go.  To answer your question though, I would absolutely not drive them to the concert.  What are you supposed to do, sit in the car for four hours?", "Why does she get to unilaterally decide who\u2019s going?", " why does your wife get to dictate who the tickets go to if you were part of getting them?\n\n If thats the case then you get 2 of the 4 so she can pick who ever she wants as her guest  you can pick whoever you want as yours", "Yeah, YWNBTA.  \n\nThey can drive themselves.  It's not like Daddy and the girls.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere near that car.", "NTA. Asking you to drive them to concert you can\u2019t attend is insane. Then, you can only go if one of the sisters can\u2019t make it? Nope! Let them drive.", "NTA Are the tickets in your name?  If so I\u2019d tell your wife if you\u2019re not going you are going to return/ sell on the tickets ands nobody is going.", "NTA. I'd be incredibly pissed and hurt if my husband did something like this to me. There's nothing wrong with her wanting a girls' trip with her sisters, but the tickets were bought with the idea of BOTH of you going. It's not fair at all to essentially take your ticket and give it to one of her sisters, yet still forcing you to take them to the concert. And yeah, it definitely makes it worse that she's hoping one of the sisters won't go. You'd be a pity fill-in at that point just to make sure the ticket doesn't go to waste, not that she actively wants you to go. That's just terrible.", "NTA! You need to make other plans on that day with alternate people and let your wife know you will not be available to chauffeur. \nLike what are you supposed to do by yourself in Van while they are at the concert for 5-6 hours?!!", "NTA - It was rude of your wife to do that and rude to ask you to drive.  Nope Nope Nope!", "OH HELL NO!! Tell wife one of those tickets is yours and they need to figure their shit out. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but just curious why they still asked you to drive?", "NTA, but why is your wife deciding who can go?", "Oh hell no! NTA! You two ordered the tickets with the plan for you to be going as well. Also, those aren't exactly cheap tickets. Nope! They can find their own transportation and I'd be asking for reimbursement of the cost of one ticket.", "Why are you even putting up with this bullshit? The reply is I\u2019m sorry but we got these tickets together and I\u2019m going.", "NTA.  That is a shitty move from your wife. Tell her that next time you try to get tickets to something where tickets are hard to get that there will only be enough money for one ticket so she won't be able to go.", "NTA. If you helped get the tickets, then it\u2019s your trip and she is t allowed to give them away. So if she allows your ticket to be given away, then they need to figure out a way to get there.", "NTA in any shape or form. But you will be an AH to yourself if you don't bluntly tell your wife her sisters can go fuck themselves. You bought the maximum number of tickets you could get, with the understanding two of them would be for yourself and your wife. If the sisters want a girlie trip/outing together, then they need to organise one, not hijack an event you have already planned. \n\nI honestly don't understand why you are letting her get away with this shit and have meekly accepted your ticket is gone.", "NTA.  Do not drive them if it is turned into a girls trip.", "NTA, but your wife is a major AH for deceiving you and making you do all the work. I wouldn\u2019t drive them either.", "Your wife is a huge asshole. NTA.", "Ummmm stand up for yourself? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even allow her to cut you out and she is a crap wife for that move.", "NTA. You should insist that one of the tickets is yours.", "NTA and was that shit bought on your account? I'd be getting ahold of one of those tickets and not giving it up and saying \"hell no, we got these tickets for us plus 2 guests. I'm going and that's that.\"", "If I was you, I would drive all four of them to the concert...And leave them there....NTA", "NTA. Seems the correct solution for you then is no one goes and you sell the tickets and make a bunch of money off them so everyone suffers the same. Or since you bought them you take 3 of your friends instead.", "NTA.\n\nKeep the tickets and take your friends, or scalp them for a profit. DO NOT roll over and let her disrespect you like this.", "Just wondering what country you are in. Her tour stops are in Agentina and Brazil for the next month. Just wondering where you are going to see her where there will be snow in the next few months.", "Who\u2019s Ticketmaster has the tickets? If it\u2019s your tell your wife you will invite some well deserving friends you pick. If your wife gets upset then she is a hypocrite. I got TS tickets for my wife and I, she would NEVER dream of giving my ticket away.", "NTA. They are your tickets. Forget about not driving. Tell your wife the sisters can all come on the \u201csisters trip\u201d, but the two who aren\u2019t fans are going to have to go get a massage and have a nice dinner out alone.", "NTA and fuck them! They better do some *more* plotting and planning.", "NTA Tell your wife what you wrote here. Then Please update your post after you talk to your wife! Hope you get to go.", "Fuc'em. Cal for an Uber and have the sisters pay.", "There is a 0% chance I'd be missing that concert. Please stand up for yourself. Your wife is wildly selfish", "NTA if you say no. But partner of the year if you do it?", "NTA let them plan and execute their night out.", "Nta", "NTA at all! I feel really bad for you. It is a big ticket show & I can tell you were looking forward to it! Aside from being mad about it, I'd just say, have fun, enjoy the show. Here's the keys. Send me a picture.", "Tell your wife to pick which sister she is gonna kick because you are definitely going.  Stand up for yourself.  She does stuff like this to you because she knows she can", "If my wife gave away my T swift tickets those would be some fighting words \ud83d\ude1c.\n\nNta did the sisters pay for the tickets?", "Definitely NTA.  I also wouldn't accept that she has the right to decide who gets the tickets you bought together.  You can use one to go if you want. If you want to take a friend do so.  You bought them together.  You have 4 tickets.  One for you, one for her, and one for each of you to invite a guest.  Don't let her dictate how these are used.  Lock two of them somewhere she can't get them if you have to.  (Although that would indicate bigger problems in your marriage).  Does she always try to dictate what you can and can't do?  Does she always put her sisters before you?", "Nope. NTA. You get two tickets and wife gets two. That\u2019s the only fair outcome. She can plan a different sisters trip another time.", "NTA.  You did the work to get the tickets and they are saying you cannot go? Oh hell no would I drive them to the concert. Make plans for that night and tell them that you hope they have a good time.", "NTA. \nLet me get this right, you and your wife bought tickets and planned on going together... then she city you out and is giving the tickets bought with your money away? \n\nI wouldn't be driving/participating.", "I would tell her you are keeping a ticket and going. That was a shitty move on her part.", "NTA, but I\u2019m wondering, does your wife have the tickets in her purse next to your balls? Why are you letting her commandeer the tickets?", "NTA.  I would be pissed that my spouse somehow thought they could commandeer the tickets.  Did she explain how that works? what the rationale was that you could not use your tickets?  (I get tht she said the sisters hoped they would be able to get more and could not, but that would be a rationale for the sisters not going, not for your not going.)\n\nBut if, because you are a bigger person that I am, you are willing to let a sister have your ticket, that should be the end of it.  Why in the world would you be the one to drive to a concert you are not going to?  Are your wife and all the sisters unable to drive?  even if that is so, can't they hire a car and driver for the event they want to go to? if not, one of them needs to give up the ticket to whoever they ask to drive--only fiar way.", "Can\u2019t you just shake it off? NTA", "In what universe would it make sense that you would drive them to this after the way they (especially your wife) treated you? And when you say that you and your wife got the tickets, does that mean that you contributed to paying for them? If so, tell your wife she can kick rocks; that you're driving yourself to the concert that you're attending, who the other three people attending are isn't of any concern to you one way or the other, and **maybe** you'll consider taking them with you if she apologizes to you for her crappy behavior.\n\nNTA, of course.", "Wait, YOU bought the tickets? And your wife is telling you that you can't go? Ummm, I would pull some friends out of my ass and tell her, \"Well, wife, you can't go because me and me and my 3 BFF's are going!\" \n\nBut...my bigger question is....are you really that much of a Swiftie? LOL!!!! (Just joking!)", "NTA and tell her that if you aren't going, you're not driving and you're selling all 4 tickets for either face value or more.  Or just sell 2 tickets and say \"I'm going, take it leave it\".  Also, do not transfer the tickets to your wife until this is resolved (maybe not even until the night of the concert).", "NTA. Crappy that she cut you out, but also, why can\u2019t your wife or one of her sisters drive if they want to go by themselves?", "I'd tell her that one of those tickets is yours. Period.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only AH is your wife - you got tickets, and your wife uninvited from the tickets YOU bought with her to take her sisters instead. That alone makes her a major AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: You are not going - why would you drive there?", "Lol- I would tell my spouse I was coming and to pick a sister to stay out. End of conversation.", "NTA.\n\nIf the two of you split the costs on the tickets then you each have one ticket to sell/gift as you see fit.\n\nShe does not get to give away 3/4 tickets and tell you that you're no longer invited.\n\nWhat a shitty thing to do!!\n\nI hope you explain to her how hurtful this is, because honestly I would be more than pissed if this happened to me.", "NTA\n\nIs your wife a bit of a pushover, and her sisters badgered her into making it a \"sisters trip\"?", "NTA\n\nI'd sell two tickets and make her choose which of her sisters she'll take with her. I too can be petty.", "Keep your ticket. One of her sisters can stay home. Or better still, your wife can stay home while you and your sisters in law go.", "Go to the concert!!!!!!!!! NTA", "I'm not a particular fan of her music, but I know people who are, REALLY are. This sucks for you. Your wife is TA.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA.\n\nTell your wife that seeing as she's organised this sisters' trip, she can work out travel and accommodation. \n\nAnd also, tell her next time you'd appreciate knowing about this before the tickets are organised.", "YWNBTA -\n\nBut this is obviously not about that. This is about how you're incredibly hurt that your wife would do that to you. You shouldn't have to drive 4 hours to a concert you're not invited to, but in terms of that refusal being a way of communicating the seriousness of your hurt, it's not gonna get the results you want.\n\nI think you need to have a serious sit-down conversation where you are vulnerable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: this would destroy me if my partner treated me this way.", "NTA you are being treated badly. I'd decline the drive for sure. You can claim a ticket if you want to go - as you \nboth purchased them? If it was you, I'd choose 3 more guy friends - lol", "NTA and ngl but my petty self would be selling 2 of the 4 tickets. Changes of plans on events you're looking forward to needs to be a consultation not a pronouncement.", "Oh the F\\*\\*\\* NO!  NTA, but your wife and her sisters are.\n\nYou get to go, but maybe you'll find 3 friends to go with you and tell your wife and her relations to suck rocks, or whatever, but I'm petty that way. \n\nProbably better if you and wife go, and sell the other two tickets. Two sisters can buy them. They are going to pay for the tickets, right?? And help with gas and lodging. And food. They pay for food.", "Wow, if I were you, I\u2019d find those tickets and tear them up. If you can\u2019t go or take one of those tickets and go by yourself or even better invite a friend and take the other three.", "I\u2019m confused. Did you all not talk about how many tix you were getting and who gets them BEFORE the purchase?", "Who paid for the tix and whose account is it? If it's yours refuse to give up one of the tix. \n\nNTA. If you helped buy it then you get to go, simple.", "NtA  Nice to finally know where you stand in that relationship, right?", "Divorce.", "NTA-Tell Her to F-off and find her own ride.  I life my wife very, very, much and she would know better than to ask me to drive in the snow 4hrs (I am assuming both ways) to a concert that I can't attend.  What are you supposed to do during the concert?", "NTA. Are you sure your wife likes you?", "Big swift guy eh man? NTA but yeeeekk", "Hellllllll no. So what they want to make it a girls trip now that the tickets are already purchased, you bought them so one of those tickets is yours. They can decide amongst themselves which sister isn't going.

Why do 4 adults needs someone to drive them.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give up your ticket. Don\u2019t drive your wife and her sisters. Instead, leave without them before they do and use your ticket. Let them figure the rest out among themselves. Your wife created this situation. She can solve it.", "NTA. You bought the tickets and aren\u2019t allowed to go? I don\u2019t think so! Go to the concert! Your wife is an AH.", "Lmao NTA\u2026if it\u2019s a girls trip, then one of the girls can drive", "and you bought the tickets.  They are your tickets. Invite whoever you want to go.", "On the off chance this is real...You're wife is the AH.  Not only would I refuse to drive them, I would claim my ticket.  You wouldn't do the following since you're a TS fan, but selling your ticket to a stranger would be ultimate FY to your wife & her sisters.", "Yes you would be the asshole. I firmly believe that the person who did the work of getting the pre-sale code, then got in the waiting room, then scrambled for tickets is 100% allowed to sell those tickets to whomever they want. Nothing annoys me more than people who think they have a claim on tickets that I hustled for (which I am actually very good at.) And I have a couple of friends who are also very good at hustling for tickets and always include me...so those people get first priority. It's a system. Some opportunities you have to earn. \n\nif you don't drive them, they will drive themselves and then you will miss the fantastic lot scene and the opportunity to find a miracle for yourself. Then you will just be the salty guy who will never be under consideration for the next tour.", "NTA, and I would imagine/ hope that one of the 2 sisters who aren't Taylor's fans would want you to go instead since you are a fan. Do you know if they know you have been kicked out like this?", "NTA but do it for the brownie points", "Your wife should be thanking her lucky stars that you actually want to go to a Taylor swift concert. My friend is obsessed and her husband, not so much.", "Who paid for the four tickets?  If you then I would look up the scalping cost and make all four sisters, including your wife pay up or no go.  I'm sure you are a better person than am I, but I'm petty.", "NTA. \nIf you don't get to attend, then why go just to be a chauffeur? Hells to the no", "NTA, on the other hand your wife is.  She is putting her sisters wants above you and your desire to go.  Also if I understand correctly your the one who made the effort to get them.  I can tell you if my husband did this there would be a very hard conversation.", "So she cut you out of the trip, kinda last minute and actually still thinks you're driving them?? Good grief NTA. They can take a cab, or you know, not be douchebags.", "Ask for something in return. Like whatever you want", "NTA!!!\n\nIf  you\u2019re not going, why would you drive them? \n\nLet the vapid ladies enjoy the entire stupid costly experience themselves, including to and fro. Not your circus, not your monkeys!. \n\nEnjoy your quiet evening!!! Sounds divine to me.\n\nAnd if you can, scalp your own ticket. And buy yourself something that will annoy tf outta your wife using that $.", "NTA", "I am honestly confused by the question. It seems like a very simple statement. \"Honey We bought these tickets so we could go together plus two extra people. I am going to this concert\".... Would solve everything?", "NTA afaic. you need to say in straight precise language why you feel your wife disrespected you and hurt your feelings, by changing plans without telling you, unincluding you at the last minute, after you went through all the effort, and ruining a good time that was originally planned for you and wifey.\n\nid be seriously pissed. she'd have to do some serious ass-kissing if she went along with her plan. and even if she didnt, there's a lot hurt needing sincere repair just because she treated my feelings so nonchalantly.\n\nNO, you shouldn't drive them if you arent going.", "You\u2019ve been freed. NTA.", "No, you would not be the AH. Your wife, otoh, totally is.", "NTA but your wife definitely is. That\u2019s cold. This is so messed up. Don\u2019t drive them.", "NTA But why exactly is your wife able to make this unilateral decision without your input?", "NTA they can drive themselves if they cut you out.", "NTA I would tell your wife that you are going to the concert. You got the tickets for yourself and her. Why does she get to decide who the tickets go to and you being cut from going? What if you told her that she is cut and you are using the tickets to go with your friends? See how that goes down, and hopefully, she will see how rude and unreasonable she is.\n\nThis would be my hill to die on. How rude and inconsiderate of your wife to just uninvited you after getting the tickets, then having the nerve to tell you that hopefully one of her sisters can't come, so you get to go. That's a huge slap on the face.\n\nJust refuse and tell her you are going.", "NTA that's super fucked up, you were supposed to go then your wife just decides you don't get too and you have to drive them. Absolutely not", "I think it is a reasonable offer if she agrees to you renting a hotel room with your choice of escort while they are at the concert. You might as well have fun too.", "Nope. They can drive themselves. But I don\u2019t understand why you are just rolling over for this if you were the one who bought the tickets and fronted the time and money for this outing. There are two other tickets available so they can figure out how to handle it but I would not be backing down if I were you. NTA.", "NTA, you each have two tickets. Your wife can pick one person, and you pick one person. Tell her that you are going.", "NTA. If my wife gave away my Taylor swift ticket I would be VERY put out.", "NTA.\n\nDoes she have access to the tickets? I'm assuming they are electronic. Regardless, make sure you have access to at least one. Leave at least 2 hours before them. Whoever tries to use the same electronic ticket will be refused entry. If it's a physical ticket, they will only have 3 for the 4 of them. Too bad, so sad.\n\nNot sure what this would do to your relationship, but it must already be shaky if she thinks she can use you to get coveted tickets & then not let you use one!\n\nI'll bet she started thinking, \"If I only invite two sisters, the third will be pissed.\" Apparently, she cares more about upsetting her sisters than her husband.", "Dudeeeeeeee", "NTA - and sell the tickets in the secondary market.", "NOPE.\n\nYou and your wife paid for the tickets, yeah? Then late in the game your wife decides to cut you out of the deal \\*and\\* require you to chauffeur them to/from in winter?\n\nNOPE.\n\nI would like clarification on which of you paid for the tickets, but even so, you seem to be a fan on equal footing. You don't deserve this treatment.\n\nYou and your wife need to talk, and hard.\n\nNTA. Good luck. You're gonna need it.", "NTA. Give her two or three tickets. Tell her she's on her own and you go solo or with a friend to the gig. You can't expect someone to get the tickets and bait and switch them like that.", "Your wife needs to tell one of her non-fan sisters that she is uninvited so you can go. This is a very uncool marital scenario. Who is PAYING for all of these tickets? If it's coming out of your joint bank account, you absolutely get to claim a ticket. At any rate, do not drive for a concert you are not attending. That would be torture. Maybe that can be wife's excuse to sister. We need Husband to drive, so we can't have you go to the concert anymore.", "NTA\n\nNot only are you not attending, you were cut from the group for two people who dont even care about going. Thats just salt in the wound. If it were me, driving there isnt even the issue, I would be putting my foot down ok not being able to go, especially if you helped get/pay for the tickets (since you have to part of the paid fan group IIRC). Thats some shady BS.", "NTA but sounds like your wife prioritize the sister over you. time to communicate and work on the relationship. it is crazy that she expects you to drive 8 hours round trip as strictly a driver.", "NTA. That\u2019s just vile.", "NTA Pretty sure one or all of them of them has a license. Buy yourself something fun to do, talk it up, and leave wife home... soon... and often until she realizes what an ass she is since she isn't admitting it now.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I suggest you make plans for something else that night. She wanted to cut you out of an experience you clearly care about, no half measures. Don't hope you're allowed to go, take ownership of the circumstances. You're busy that night, sorry. \n\nOp, would you say you're sidelined in favor of your wife's family often? How often does your spouse prioritize you and your feelings? A relationship should have healthy mutual respect; it kind of sounds like she's using you or taking you for granted. I'd also question what your communication levels are like, she sprung this on you with no warning in the car? If you planned a nice vacation to a tropical island and then told her she can come if your buddy Mark from work can't make it, would your wife be upset?\n\n\nI'm not trying to break you up, let me be clear. I'm just trying to ask questions you may not have asked yourself.

Tell her to make sure the tank is filled up before going and that they have car chargers to make sure their phones are charged in case there's an emergency.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I wouldn't let this fly. Did you pay for the tickets with your CC? If so tell them that you are going or noone is as you will be returning the tickets or putting them up for resale.   \n\n\nIf you choose not to fight it, they can drive and pay for themselves.  I would also be planning my own event that wife gets no option to attend.", "I fully back you on this, tell her you won't drive...after all you didn't suddenly become the family chauffeur did you? And your feelings didn't count when you got left out.\n\nIts odd that she TOLD you you couldn't go after you two got the tickets. Sorry dude thats some serious disrespect and you can't let that go, otherwise you're a doormat again down the line.\n\nExplain it to her as nicely as possible, she will get mad, which will be ok in the grand scheme of things as your feelings about being left out really won't count. Rest assured it will be all about them and you being insecure, having a tantrum, acting like a child etc etc.\n\nThat was a completely shitty thing she did, and she needs to realize that.", "NTA.  You both bought the tickets, so at least 2 of those tickets are yours.  Just tell her how you feel, and that you will not be giving up your ticket(s.) She\u2019s out of line here, and disrespectful.
