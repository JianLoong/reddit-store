My best advice to anyone who did not grow up with good financial role models is to **educate yourself on financial literacy**. Don't fall into the same trap as your mother, and don't swing too hard the other way. Making lots of money doesn't mean you know how to hold onto it.", "NTA\n\nI would stop the spending and start to save to move out. I understand her frustration", "You're not an asshole, but you're acting stupid. I did the same in my early 20s when I lived at home and its thousands I'll never see again on stuff I don't have/use anymore. It could have been invested in a car, saving up for living alone, or travel. You need to learn how to budget things because eventually you're mother will kick you out (or you'll want to leave, which was my case) and then you won't be able to pay for bills and luxuries.", "Your mother\u2019s bad financial decisions aren\u2019t on you but do tread wisely. At 18, I doubt you have a full-time job that pays well. Instead of spending on frivolous items \u2014 I do understand a good pair of jeans though, looking to find the perfect fit myself \u2014 please do make sure to keep some for a rainy day. Educate yourself! Financial literacy is so important!\n\nAlso $600 a month for rent is likely a steal wherever you are, and if your mother\u2019s feelings sour, you might need to prepare moving elsewhere which is going to hurt your wallet since it seems like your mother is still subsidising your lifestyle. You pay a likely lower rent and it seems you don\u2019t pay for food or groceries that you very likely consume. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s on you to manage your mother\u2019s emotions but\u2026 Yeah.

When I started working my first job at 16, I bought my own things along with food (which we never really had enough of at home) and my own school supplies as well as things I needed when I went to college. My dad's response wasn't \"I'm so proud of you.\" It was \"Why don't you fucking buy \\[Insert Item Name Here\\] for the rest of us!?? You're so fucking selfish!\" It was pure abuse from my dad every time. You're 18 and clearly an adult about to go out into the world to continue providing for yourself and improving  yourself. It's not your responsibility to provide for the rest of the family. That is your mom's job. You are NTA and maybe you should look at getting a PO box to have things delivered too aside from food deliveries.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your job to support the family financially.

However, you should save money and get your own place. You should think of yourself and your future. It's not selfish, it's responsible.", "NTA, as the child it is not your job to provide for your mother. Why is she a fulltime student with 5 children?\n\nI can understand her frustration in parts, but she has no right to demand your money or yell at you.

You are currently paying the rent that you have agreed upon and working hard for your money. You would think that she would be proud of you for working hard and being able to provide nice things for yourself rather than getting angry at you. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to provide for your siblings just because you are the oldest.

You're 18 years, working full time, paying rent and I bet contributing in other ways to the household.\n\nI can see other comments mentioning about your mom shouldn't have had children If she couldn't afford them - I would truly love to live in their Utopia where the future is written in stone and you know exactly what's going to happen in your life and be prepared for it. From what you have written, your mum is trying to make her life and your siblings lives better by returning to education and studying full time. As I see it, your family have been living under extreme stress for the past number of years and as the adult your mum has taken the burden of this. This is the type of financial problem that really buries into your thoughts and even affects how you deal with others. Is she right to lash out at you now? No, she isn't. But I would bet that she fears that you may end up in a similar financial situation as her, struggling to get by and living from pay check to pay check and she does not want that for you. So what can you do? You certainly can offer more rent and there's always the option to move out, but have you actually sat down with your mother and talked with her? I mean have a conversation about her fears and her hopes for her future and you and your siblings futures.

You don\u2019t owe your family the money you earn. However, OP, proceed with caution. Your rent payment is quite low, and you\u2019re legally an adult. You therefore live in the house at your mother\u2019s pleasure. If she feels uncomfortable having you \u201cflaunt\u201d your income, she may decide to let you experience the expense of paying your own way, and you\u2019ll lose out on a lot of that discretionary spending money. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re not paying for food (you say you\u2019re paying for your own necessities but it seems odd to mention hygiene products but leave out the much larger expense of food) or household utilities. She\u2019d have to raise the price quite a lot before it would be cheaper for you to live elsewhere. Just as you have the right to spend your money how you see fit, your mother has the right to decide she\u2019s not wanting to subsidize your lifestyle.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but as a practical matter, I wouldn\u2019t push your luck too much on this.", "NTA you pay rent and you spend your own well earned money.

She should be proud that at your age you are working, and support her with the rent.", "I\u2019m not gonna issue a judgment but I do think you need to spend money wisely. You have a job now, but then what? Are you going to work this job your whole life while staying at home? Or are you going to advance your career in other ways, like college or trade school? $150 for a pair of jeans is very expensive and tbh not a wise way of spending money. I suggest you think about the future and use the advantage of low rent to save up for the future you want. Then when you\u2019re comfortable financially, you can help out your family if you want", "NTA, but do yourself an enormous favor and learn to budget and save now. I highly recommend the YNAB (You Need A Budget) app. It\u2019s not free, but it is more than worth the cost, IMO. If you learn to handle money well now, it will pay off enormously in the long run. Good luck!", "NTA for now, but be careful. It's not an easy situation, but good for you that you get spending money. It is rather provocative to have it sent to your doorstep and rubbing it in your mom's face that way.\nOn that note, hope you're saving up too!", "NTA but please learn from my mistakes and dont spend frivolous amounts of money without also building a savings account. When I first started working, I spent all of my money bc I didnt know any better and when I turned 19 I spent over a year extremely broke and so stressed out. Like maxing out my credit card bc I had no other money to live off of, sleep for dinner, paying for gas in quarters, couldn\u2019t afford medications broke even though I was working that entire time. Make sure you build up a decent savings too.", "NTA, but you seriously need to consider to slow down with your shopping addiction or you will end up in a similar financial situation on the long run. learn from the mistakes your mother did and set aside a small amount mothly to get you started once you move out, which i rather would do sooner than later.", "NTA. As you said in a previous comment. Your mom works \"casually\". Receives child support from 2 of the fathers and gets government assistance. \n\nBut expects you to pay more than you already agreed towards the bills?

You pay rent and all of your own necessities.  She is welcome to ask for higher rent and you can choose to agree or move out but it is not your responsibility to just give her money to support her and her choices (4 other children). \n\nGranted, $150 is a lot for a pair of jeans but if that's what you like and you earn the money, you can choose to splurge how you want.", "I would say NTA. It's not on you to help support the family - 18 year olds should be able to go out and have fun and it's your money. Your mum is probably stressed with uni, bills, kids, but you are also her child, and you do contribute. \n\nYou have your whole life to worry about bills etc. Maybe it's a bit insensitive though to have parcels delivered if your mum is struggling. Maybe arrange to have them collected? Buying clothes doesn't make you TA, but maybe it would be easier in your mum if she didn't see the evidence of your disposable income.", "NTA She is entitled to rent and not a penny more. You're paying rent...$600 in fact when most kids your age either don't or pay $200-300.

You are not the parent, you are not responsible for keeping bills paid and food on the table. You're contributing financially and covering your own expenses.

She shouldn't be putting that on you. \n\nFor everyone saying $150 for jeans is too much, I've spent up to $200 on jeans and as low as $10. The cheap ones wear out much faster and lose their shape quickly, while expensive ones last years (sometimes decades) in great condition. Certain things (jeans, shoes, jackets) are worth spending more on initially because the quality means they last well and end up costing less than constant replacements of cheaper versions. There is a hidden cost in being poor where you end up spending more on cheap versions longer term because you can't afford to get quality stuff initially. OP - choose carefully the items that you spend big money on but don't feel ashamed of investing in things that will last you years", "Nta. You pay rent and im also assuming you that you help around the house and are responsible for your own laundry ect correct? If that\u2019s the case than your fine and well within your right to spend your money how you please", "NTA. You pay $300 fortnightly, so $600 a month.

I can't understand the YTA posts.", "I mean yeah it\u2019s your money but it\u2019s really gonna bite you in the ass once you move out on your own and realize rent is a hell of a lot more then $600 a month, especially if you\u2019re not currently also paying for electricity, water, and food, and you have no savings due to having spent an additional $100 average each week on shopping sprees. Spending that much every week when you\u2019re in this situation just tells me you still don\u2019t really understand the value of money. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say you\u2019re an asshole because it *is* your money and you\u2019re still relatively young but I have to ask: is your mom sacrificing her own luxuries to provide heating, a roof over your head, and food on your table?

There is a happy in between. You are earning and should be able to finally start meeting your needs (I used to have to buy my own school supplies once I started working and could finally buy some new cheap clothes). It's normal to look after yourself, but try not to look like you're rubbing it in people's faces, yeah? Also, as others have said, make sure you are making good financial decisions and not just blowing your money on expensive things because you never had them before. Start saving your money and look out for good sales!", "You are not responsible for your family. I know your mother is trying to force you into responsibility - mine did too. But you didn't decide to give birth to them and you are not responsible for them.

When I lived at home my parents were also jealous of the things I bought. I once had a fight with my dad about my switch which I worked hard for at my part time job.

Financial literacy should be a priority for you.", "That's a fair point.", "Exactly! We don\u2019t know anyone\u2019s full story here and there are people out there who had a wonderful situation with their multiple kids and something happens, their spouse dies, their house is destroyed in a fire, they are robbed, etc.", "I wasn't intending on shaming anyone, merely pointing out the possibility.", "Why? I'm only pointing out the possibility.", "Plus it has been difficult for low income women to access birth control for quite some time, especially those living outside cities.", "Like I said, but I guess I\u2019ll just say it again. Her mom doesn\u2019t seem to be asking for help financially. Just is probably frustrated with OP\u2019s spending habits.", "Happiness is a choice, there is still immense beauty in the world. People always think the worlds going to end, but it  hasn\u2019t yet. Generations still alive lived through the 2nd world war, the birth of the atomic age, the Cold War, the Doomsday clock. But you want us to be worried about  micro plastics and climate change? Personally I don\u2019t worry about anything I can\u2019t affect", "It kind of is, though. Despite the plastics and climate change. \n\nYour parents give you the gift not only of life but an upbringing and care (unless you're unlucky). I agree that the balance of responsibility is different but it's awfully Kevin-the-teenager that whole \"I didn't ask you be born!!! You can't make me!!\"", "She is paying for her own hygiene products and bought a pair of jeans when she outgrew her previous jeans. \n\nWhile she says she has a shopping addiction, it sounds like she grew up poor and doesn\u2019t realize most people replace clothing we can no longer wear. \n\nHer mother is angry that she is an adult with a job and no children. Her mother is the asshole.", "How old are you?", "We're referring to entitled parents here who expect their children to be ok with being treated like shit in one way or another bc of the privilege of being born and bc they did the bare minimum requirements of being a parent and in some cases, not even that."]}
