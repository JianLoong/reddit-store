I still live at home and pay $300 fortnightly for rent (I pay for all my other necessities myself eg phone bill and hygiene products). My family has been very poor my whole life. As my mum (44f) is a single mum who is studying full time, and looking after 5 children. \n\nI have a slight shopping addiction (as lots of girls my age do) and at least once a week some sort package/food order is showing up at our doorstep. Today a new pair of jeans (around $150) arrived (as I was in desperate need for a new pair, as I\u2019ve outgrown my old ones) and my mum blew up at me. She called me selfish, insensitive and that she\u2019s ashamed I am her daughter, telling me that I should think about how it makes her feel when I buy an excessive amount of clothes, when she can barely afford to heat the house in the winter time. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not offering to pay more rent and help more with my family of sixes bills, or is she insane for asking me to stop spending my hard earned money on things I want?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nJust a bit more context for everyone \n\nThe jeans where a nice pair of blue Levi\u2019s jeans, that should last me forever as they are such good quality, which Is why they were so expensive. This is in Australian dollars aswell. \n\nPeople who say I\u2019m flaunting my money, I\u2019d like to specify that I\u2019m at work when the packages come so mum will take them in (I have not asked her to do this) and she or my sisters will always ask what it is/to try it on and how much it was. \n\nAddressing the shopping addiction aswell, I have a long list of mental health issues which I think contribute greatly to the addiction, but I\u2019m trying to get it under control.", "created_utc": 1678185572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kvti4/aita_for_buying_myself_expensive_clothes_when_my/", "score": 7480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My best advice to anyone who did not grow up with good financial role models is to **educate yourself on financial literacy**. Don't fall into the same trap as your mother, and don't swing too hard the other way. Making lots of money doesn't mean you know how to hold onto it.", "NTA\n\nI would stop the spending and start to save to move out. I understand her frustration", "You're not an asshole, but you're acting stupid. I did the same in my early 20s when I lived at home and its thousands I'll never see again on stuff I don't have/use anymore. It could have been invested in a car, saving up for living alone, or travel. You need to learn how to budget things because eventually your mother will kick you out (or you'll want to leave, which was my case) and then you won't be able to pay for bills and luxuries.", "Your mother\u2019s bad financial decisions aren\u2019t on you but do tread wisely.

Instead of spending on frivolous items \u2014 I do understand a good pair of jeans though, looking to find the perfect fit myself \u2014 please do make sure to keep some for a rainy day. Educate yourself! Financial literacy is so important!\n\nAlso $600 a month for rent is likely a steal wherever you are, and if your mother\u2019s feelings sour, you might need to prepare moving elsewhere which is going to hurt your wallet since it seems like your mother is still subsidising your lifestyle. You pay a likely lower rent and it seems you don\u2019t pay for food or groceries that you very likely consume. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s on you to manage your mother\u2019s emotions but\u2026 Yeah.

My dad's response wasn't \"I'm so proud of you.\" It was \"Why don't you fucking buy \\[Insert Item Name Here\\] for the rest of us!?? You're so fucking selfish!\" It was pure abuse from my dad every time. You're 18 and clearly an adult about to go out into the world to continue providing for yourself and improving  yourself. It's not your responsibility to provide for the rest of the family. That is your mom's job. You are NTA and maybe you should look at getting a PO box to have things delivered too aside from food deliveries.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your job to support the family financially.

However, you should save money and get your own place. You should think of yourself and your future. It's not selfish, it's responsible.", "NTA, as the child it is not your job to provide for your mother. Why is she a fulltime student with 5 children?\n\nI can understand her frustration in parts, but she has no right to demand your money or yell at you.

You are currently paying the rent that you have agreed upon and working hard for your money. You would think that she would be proud of you for working hard and being able to provide nice things for yourself rather than getting angry at you. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to provide for your siblings just because you are the oldest.

You're 18 years, working full time, paying rent and I bet contributing in other ways to the household.\n\nI can see other comments mentioning about your mom shouldn't have had children If she couldn't afford them - I would truly love to live in their Utopia where the future is written in stone and you know exactly what's going to happen in your life and be prepared for it. From what you have written, your mum is trying to make her life and your siblings lives better by returning to education and studying full time. As I see it, your family have been living under extreme stress for the past number of years and as the adult your mum has taken the burden of this. This is the type of financial problem that really buries into your thoughts and even affects how you deal with others. Is she right to lash out at you now? No, she isn't. But I would bet that she fears that you may end up in a similar financial situation as her, struggling to get by and living from pay check to pay check and she does not want that for you. So what can you do? You certainly can offer more rent and there's always the option to move out, but have you actually sat down with your mother and talked with her? I mean have a conversation about her fears and her hopes for her future and you and your siblings futures. In any event I wish nothing but good for your family and that one day your mum will feel peace of mind.", "NTA however instead of buying yourself luxury items save every dime so you can move out.", "NAH\n\nShe may feel hurt that you're not helping your family, but you have all the right to spend your money as you want.

But consider saving more of your money and also consider that your spending on more lavish items is because you grew up with less.", "NTA you basically pay half her rent, \n\nHer problems are not your responsability", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe your family the money you earn. However, OP, proceed with caution. Your rent payment is quite low, and you\u2019re legally an adult. You therefore live in the house at your mother\u2019s pleasure. If she feels uncomfortable having you \u201cflaunt\u201d your income, she may decide to let you experience the expense of paying your own way, and you\u2019ll lose out on a lot of that discretionary spending money. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re not paying for food (you say you\u2019re paying for your own necessities but it seems odd to mention hygiene products but leave out the much larger expense of food) or household utilities. She\u2019d have to raise the price quite a lot before it would be cheaper for you to live elsewhere. Just as you have the right to spend your money how you see fit, your mother has the right to decide she\u2019s not wanting to subsidize your lifestyle.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but as a practical matter, I wouldn\u2019t push your luck too much on this.\n\nETA: For those thinking the monthly rent amount is high, OP is in Australia, the price is therefore about $600/month in Australian dollars, or about $400/month in USD. If you want to give yourself an aneurysm try looking up monthly rent for a private bedroom in your area. It\u2019s heinous. If OP had 5 friends ready to split the lease for an entire apartment, that would be one thing (even then you\u2019d be hard pressed to beat that rate), but she\u2019s not going to get a better deal renting a room elsewhere.\n\nETA2: also, OP, in case your edit to your post about \u201cflaunting\u201d is responding to my comment, let me be clear on this: I do not, personally, think buying a pair of jeans (or other clothing items) is flaunting. At all. My caution is solely based on how your mum might be viewing it, given her comments to you.", "NTA you pay rent and you spend your own well earned money. You are not asking her money for your expenses, nore you waiting for someone else to buy you things. She should be proud that at your age you are working, and support her with the rent.", "I\u2019m not gonna issue a judgment but I do think you need to spend money wisely. You have a job now, but then what? Are you going to work this job your whole life while staying at home? Or are you going to advance your career in other ways, like college or trade school? $150 for a pair of jeans is very expensive and tbh not a wise way of spending money. I suggest you think about the future and use the advantage of low rent to save up for the future you want. Then when you\u2019re comfortable financially, you can help out your family if you want\n\nEDIT: stop arguing with me about clothing price. If you want to buy expensive clothing, you\u2019ll find reasons to justify it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll find other sources of affordable yet still durable clothing. Expensive doesn\u2019t mean better", "NTA, but do yourself an enormous favor and learn to budget and save now. I highly recommend the YNAB (You Need A Budget) app. It\u2019s not free, but it is more than worth the cost, IMO. If you learn to handle money well now, it will pay off enormously in the long run. Good luck!", "NTA for now, but be careful. It's not an easy situation, but good for you that you get spending money. It is rather provocative to have it sent to your doorstep and rubbing it in your mom's face that way.\nOn that note, hope you're saving up too!", "NTA but please learn from my mistakes and dont spend frivolous amounts of money without also building a savings account. When I first started working, I spent all of my money bc I didnt know any better and when I turned 19 I spent over a year extremely broke and so stressed out. Like maxing out my credit card bc I had no other money to live off of, sleep for dinner, paying for gas in quarters, couldn\u2019t afford medications broke even though I was working that entire time. Make sure you build up a decent savings too.", "NTA, but you seriously need to consider to slow down with your shopping addiction or you will end up in a similar financial situation on the long run. learn from the mistakes your mother did and set aside a small amount mothly to get you started once you move out, which i rather would do sooner than later.", "NTA. As you said in a previous comment. Your mom works \"casually\". Receives child support from 2 of the fathers and gets government assistance. \n\nBut expects you to pay more than you already agreed towards the bills?

You pay rent and all of your own necessities.  She is welcome to ask for higher rent and you can choose to agree or move out but it is not your responsibility to just give her money to support her and her choices (4 other children). \n\nGranted, $150 is a lot for a pair of jeans but if that's what you like and you earn the money, you can choose to splurge how you want.", "I would say NTA. It's not on you to help support the family - 18 year olds should be able to go out and have fun and it's your money. Your mum is probably stressed with uni, bills, kids, but you are also her child, and you do contribute. \n\nYou have your whole life to worry about bills etc. Maybe it's a bit insensitive though to have parcels delivered if your mum is struggling. Maybe arrange to have them collected? Buying clothes doesn't make you TA, but maybe it would be easier in your mum if she didn't see the evidence of your disposable income.", "NTA She is entitled to rent and not a penny more. You're paying rent...$600 in fact when most kids your age either don't or pay $200-300. Hell, at $600 a month you might as well just look for friends or anyone really looking for a roommate if this is how she's gonna act like.", "INFO: What do you mean by a \u201cslight shopping addiction\u201d?", "NTA. You are not the parent, you are not responsible for keeping bills paid and food on the table. You're contributing financially and covering your own expenses. If you have a lot of extra cash you could consider sharing it but you are not obliged to do that, you're not responsible for your mother or your siblings. \n\nI get where your mum is coming from but it's her issue, not yours. She shouldn't be putting that on you. \n\nFor everyone saying $150 for jeans is too much, I've spent up to $200 on jeans and as low as $10. The cheap ones wear out much faster and lose their shape quickly, while expensive ones last years (sometimes decades) in great condition. Certain things (jeans, shoes, jackets) are worth spending more on initially because the quality means they last well and end up costing less than constant replacements of cheaper versions. There is a hidden cost in being poor where you end up spending more on cheap versions longer term because you can't afford to get quality stuff initially. OP - choose carefully the items that you spend big money on but don't feel ashamed of investing in things that will last you years", "Nta. You pay rent and im also assuming you that you help around the house and are responsible for your own laundry ect correct?

On top of that you pay for all your own necessities yourself (I'm not sure if you're including food in that too, if not maybe you could offer to contribute towards food costs if possible)  \n\n\nYou're spending your wage on you, that you worked for. I can't understand the YTA posts.", "I mean yeah it\u2019s your money but it\u2019s really gonna bite you in the ass once you move out on your own and realize rent is a hell of a lot more then $600 a month, especially if you\u2019re not currently also paying for electricity, water, and food, and you have no savings due to having spent an additional $100 average each week on shopping sprees. Spending that much every week when you\u2019re in this situation just tells me you still don\u2019t really understand the value of money. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say you\u2019re an asshole because it *is* your money and you\u2019re still relatively young but I have to ask: is your mom sacrificing her own luxuries to provide heating, a roof over your head, and food on your table?

There is a happy in between. You are earning and should be able to finally start meeting your needs (I used to have to buy my own school supplies once I started working and could finally buy some new cheap clothes). It's normal to look after yourself, but try not to look like you're rubbing it in people's faces, yeah? Also, as others have said, make sure you are making good financial decisions and not just blowing your money on expensive things because you never had them before. Start saving your money and look out for good sales!", "You are not responsible for your family. I know your mother is trying to force you into responsibility - mine did too. But you didn't decide to give birth to them and you are not responsible for them.

When I lived at home my parents were also jealous of the things I bought. I once had a fight with my dad about my switch which I worked hard for at my part time job.

You\u2019re both reacting to poverty in unhealthy way, but the poverty itself is the real enemy. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to end up like your mother, make sure you put a good portion of your money into savings and only do these splurges with whatever you have leftover after.

And lastly, OP should recognize that while she does pay rent, it\u2019s a lot less than what she would pay for her own apartment with rent, gas and electricity and water utilities, wifi, food, etc.  Living with her mother enables her to afford such frivolities as expensive clothing.  She might want to consider the optics of having luxury items delivered to a struggling household where she\u2019s paying a fraction to have a roof over her head, electricity to see with, gas or oil to keep warm, water to bathe with, etc. OP isn\u2019t a child, after all; she\u2019s legally an adult who is technically no longer entitled to be dependent on her mother.

Wait for sales. Sites like camelcamelcamel.com can track prices and let you know when a product is at a good price to buy so you aren\u2019t wasting extra money. Watch out for \u201cfake sales\u201d - many places will raise prices right before a sale so that lowering the price seems reasonable when it really isn\u2019t. \n\n3. Always check the return policy. Impulse purchases that seem great at the time can be returned when the novelty wears off (assuming they\u2019re in returnable condition) but some retailers do not allow returns. Be aware and plan accordingly. \n\n4. MOST IMPORTANTLY your family doesn\u2019t seem to be in a place to support your future. It\u2019s ok to spend some of the money you earn - you\u2019re 18. But, make sure you are putting money away for your future.

Of course it is not required for you, OP, to not 'flaunt' your money... but you're an adult now, have some reason. Your mother clearly is struggling to support you all, and unless you are paying HALF the rent (being half the adults who live at home) and half the utilities, you are not really 'paying your share'. In other words, because you are still her child your mother is continuing to provide you with a discounted rent / bills. I'm sure to her it looks like you are basically taking the money that could be going to rent and instead spending it 'frivolously' - and there is no argument you can make that can justify 150 on jeans as anything but frivolous (to be clear, it is your right to do so).\n\nYour mother sees herself struggling for years to make sure you can have at least a basically decent life. For the last 18 years it was her responsibility to see you given the basic necessities and it sounds like she did since you haven't just moved out already. You do not OWE her for this, it was her responsibility... but if she gave you a half-decent life, you should look at her luxuries now and ask yourself if it is still fair, as a legal adult, to pay the amount of rent you are paying. Look at local options - how much would you be paying if you had your own place, or shared a place with 2-3 others? Then consider how your mother feels when in her mind she's giving you a discount as her child and you are taking that money (that I assume she hoped you would put into savings / tuition) and spending it willy-nilly. I doubt your mom ever had the ability to afford jeans for herself that cost more than $15.00.\n\nSo to reiterate - you are NTA for spending your money how you wish, but it really shows a lack of empathy in my opinion. If you have a 'shopping problem' a good solution is to have less money! I would recommend either increasing your contribution to your home OR put your excess money into a savings account that is untouchable for now and use it for something that will advance your place in life - a downpayment, tuition, etc... If your mother has been sacrificing for so long to give you a better life, the thing she will want most is to SEE you have a better life than her financially. Show her this by either helping out more OR by proving you can be responsible with money so that she knows you can fend for yourself if / when she can no longer afford to feed 6 mouths.

No, we can't always predict the future and know when long-term illnesses or layoffs or divorce or death is going to occur, but it seems to me that under the circumstances in this particular situation, her mother could and should have been more self aware. It's one thing to have had kids under different circumstances and have subsequently fallen on hard times; it's another to have already been experiencing financial difficulties and subsequently continue having children that you are struggling to provide for. I applaud her for going back to school and don't have any real judgement in my heart for her, but I also don't think she has the right to get mad at OP when the basis of her anger isn't \"i need more help\" or \"I'm concerned that you're developing bad financial habits and would like to discuss it\", it's \"think about how bad you're making me feel\".

OP's mom is just projecting her own frustrations of managing finances. \n\nAlso I would tread carefully about offering to pay more in rent and just save to move out.

I spent my childhood moving so many times, often once or twice a school year because my mother was crap with money. I wasn't taught how to manage money. My ex-husband insisted on handling the finances and handled us into plenty of debt and tax liens.

Then one day I moved out of state, the place I was going to work for ended no longer being in business, ended up having to settle for a minimum wage job, then I got hit with some medical stuff that left me unable to walk for a year. I wish I had been better prepared financially and seeked out anything that would have taught me better because I see myself heading in the same direction as my parents.", "Well said", "I could not have said it better! I am a therapist and I can spend several sessions helping my clients understand how money works and how to manage it. \n\nI have helped people out of out-of-control shopping behaviors by helping them understand the impact of their purchases on their present and future (among other interventions). \n\nOP You're NTA. There's a way through this. I hope you find a way to reconcile this with your mother.", "People just love to be selfish and justify it. I think she should ask if the mother needs help.
