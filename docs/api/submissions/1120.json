I didn't think much of it until he texted me asking why i followed his best friend, i said just for fun but then he started asking dumb questions about why was it dumb, and ofc bc we argue a lot over small stuff, i decided just to try to avoid conflict and just gave some dumb answers. Anyways a few days later me and his bsf chatted more and she asked me for my snap, so i gave it to her, but i was concerned about him getting mad all the time so i tried to hide everyrhing. Then one day, we had a argument AGAIN just because i mentioned his best friend, but like actually i just mentioned her in a normal conversation and he started getting over protective, which is kinda weird to me bc he gets jealous over people easily but not for me? I don't know, but it was a sign that he lost interest because you stop caring when you lose interest. Anyways I went and told his bsf about what happened and then an hour later, she made a group called \"i'm scared\". Basically, she told my bf EVERYTHING, bc she thought it was wrong for keeping things secret from him. Now honestly, i didn't really care because i knew he would find out. We talked it out and everything was fine. A few days after the incident we broke up though because of some other causes (he was unreasonably rude to me and made me feel unwanted, he flirted and acted obsessed with 2 other girls and let one of them sit on his lap). I talked with his best friend even more (every 2 days or smh) and that time i said smh in the lines of: \" well if you tell him again i wouldn't really care, i wasn't expecting you to hide it from him either.\" Now as the time went by and we talked, she found out that my ex has always been telling her everything that ppl did to him, and he didn't say what he did to others \"to play innocent\" and then i told her about everything he did to me in the past and she was SHOCKED and i mean SHOCKED (he caused me a panic attack in SCHOOL bc he spread rumors about me that aren't true, but even after the panic attack he still thinks that the rumors are true even if they're not) And now his bsf lost trust in him (i didn't want it to be like this :[ ) and she trusts me more than him because i didn't keep any secrets and she knows the bad things i did.\n\nNow i don't really feel guilty for making his bsf like me more, even though he said he'd kill both of us if we liked eachother more than him.

Besides I feel you and his best friend is too good to be friends with someone so manipulative as him.", "\"He said he'd kill both of us if we liked each other more than him\" - OP, RUN, get away from this toxic person in any capacity.

I thought it was my fault bc he always put the blame on me when smh bad happened, again thank you \u2764", "Don't worry, i have blocked him everywhere and i try to not communicate with him bc we are in the same class.
