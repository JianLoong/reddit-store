I'd appreciate help on this one and I'll hold my hands up if I am AH. \n\nI (29M) have been with my girlfriend (29F)for 3 years now. About 6 months ago she moved into my place (I am the sole owner). As I could comfortably live alone and I do not charge her rent or bills as I'd prefer for her to save for our future plans and be sustainable in life without money worries (she stresses a lot now atm).\n\nThere was one stipulation to her moving in and I completely understand her grievances. Unfortunately I am terribly allergic to dogs, especially their hair. Puffy eyes, sneezing, tights chest you name it. She has a dog and I told her if she moves in I'd prefer if it stayed with her parents. She wasn't happy but considering my allergies agreed and accepted this until about 3 weeks ago. Her parents have decided they can no longer look after the dog. It's a labrador and they shed hair in bucket loads - her parents got sick of cleaning it up. \n\nNow it was either put the dog up for adoption or the dog moves into my place. My girlfriend was heartbroken and wouldn't even budge at the thought of adoption. She was adament she'd keep the dog away from me and there would be no issues as the dog would never be in sight and restricted to one room. I still don't think she fully accepts the nature of my allergies. But nonetheless I do love the thought of dogs and I couldn't see her upset over giving her animal up. I agreed on her conditions and warned her it would only be a trial to see how I get on around the dog.\n\nAs you can imagine the dog was never restricted to one room. The poor dog cries if its stuck in one room. Anyways, there was hairs everywhere. Roaming room to room. My allergies go through the roof. I wfh so this was a nightmare.\n\nI tried to speak to my girlfriend and let her know we can't continue like this the dog needs to go she flipped out said she'd go with it if that's the case and I was heartless. We agreed that she would attempt to train the dog. This was over a week ago and no effort has been put into this. I had enough I called a groomer to shave the dog and at least try and make the situation more manageable for myself. I thought it was a fair compromise. Anyways my girlfriend came home went absolutely crazy and we argued and she left. I don't think she's coming back I think we've broke up. I accept my actions weren't fair. However I can't live with her and the dog. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: I'm reading everyone's comments and it's became clear that labradors shouldn't be cut for those that say it isn't fluffy its a long coat one. I don't know the difference but they are fluffy. The groomer never stipulated that it shouldn't be cut. If they did I wouldn't have. Simple. I accept I should've done research and a quick Google shows that it's obvious I shouldn't have done this. I am no dog expert and am not passing the blame onto the groomer it's my fault.", "created_utc": 1671720550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsnsnk/aita_for_cutting_my_girlfriends_dogs_hair/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know i would never date someone who is allergic to cats as I have 2.\n\nHOWEVER, she is completely TAH when it comes to taking care of the dog's hair. I have family who are allergic to cats and clean the house compltely once a week or at least pass the vacuum every other day in case they were to show up.

The undercoat provides insulation from the cold and heat and its density helps to protect the skin from minor injuries from bug bites, thorns and other natural outdoor hazards. The guard hairs provide a second layer that can reflect sunlight, repel water and protect the undercoat. In the cooler months with shorter days of sunlight, the body\u2019s response is to grow a more dense undercoat and as the days grow longer and warmer, the undercoat is triggered to release to provide more space between the guard hairs allowing for the skin to cool down. Once the undercoat is shed, the guard hairs continue to reflect the sunlight but the air is able to flow over the skin and the dog can more easily regulate their body temperature. Cutting a double-coated dog's fur too short destroys the guard hairs and allows the dense undercoat to take over as the main coat. This dense coat will trap heat and will not reflect the sunlight, therefore the dog may be more likely to overheat, even suffer heatstroke in warmer weather.\n\nFor most long-coated dogs, a bit of a trim is fine, but you don't want to overdo it. Labrador retrievers have short fur to begin with, so it's easier to destroy the coat by trimming it. Most trustworthy groomers will refuse to cut the fur of a labrador and other short-furred breeds. The groomer I take my labrador to would be horrified if I even suggested getting my dog's fur cut.", "That's a responsible and reasonable choice to make, especially early on.
