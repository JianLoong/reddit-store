They\u2019d talked it over with my grandma, and they didn\u2019t it was safe for me to be in a foreign country alone. \n\nFor context: I am capable. I am an adult, have no restrictions, am intelligent and resourceful etc. I was learning Spanish and working out in preparation for the trip. I was *ready.* Naturally, I\u2019m not happy about his counteroffer\u2014he takes me to a different race. Got no room 4 specifics (it\u2019s all F1 jargon anyway) but we decide on something.  \n\nAfter we hand up, I begin to feel really awful. My parents just went behind my back and pulled the rug out from under me. They were fine letting me go until my grandma spoke up, and now they decide they don\u2019t respect my autonomy as a person. I am an *adult*, I am using *my own money* to visit museums and a race, putting in effort to learn and better myself before it.\n\nI talk with my friends, and they tell me in no uncertain terms that I need to stand up to them and not let my parents steamroll me. That I cannot settle for their replacement, and that I have a right to do what I want as an adult. \n\nSo I call dad again. I tell him that I\u2019m fine with the deal and I won\u2019t push Barcelona further, but state the points my friends told me, how I\u2019m really upset that my own parents think I\u2019m na\u00efve and unable to take care of myself on my own. Dad informs me that grandma was throwing some sort of fit, and he concedes to a better deal. I take it.\n\nThis is where I mess up. I call grandma. The way I see it, she\u2019s the one I have a problem with. She went behind my back to get my trip cancelled, but I am mature and will confront *her* instead of complaining to mom like she did. I, and I make sure to do this tactfully and politely, tell her that I\u2019m an adult and don\u2019t appreciate her going behind my back to get my plans canceled. She tells me that I should respect my elders and she has experience that I\u2019ll learn in time. I ask her why she thinks Barcelona is more dangerous than Chicago (the city I live near and have been through alone.) Eventually it comes out that her neighbor, whom I have met exactly once, was a an undercover DEA officer in Detroit and *he* would never let *his* granddaughters travel alone abroad. \n\nI\u2019m so glad that now my personal decision is being made not by me, not by my parents, not even by my grandparents, but by an ex-fed who lives on my grandparents\u2019 street. I let my grandparents know that this is not their place, and it *definitely* isn\u2019t the neighbor\u2019s place to dictate *my* travel plans, and hang up. \n\nApparently my mom had to deal with a long phone call from grandma, crying, after that. Mom called me a bitch. Maybe I am.\n\nTL;DR: My plans get changed, so I confront the person responsible, who happens to be my grandma and is now crying.
