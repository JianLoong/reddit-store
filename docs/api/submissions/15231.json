You both need to talk things out and understand each others positions, specially him with you, and figure things out, like which other kinds of affection are you giving each other so that you both feel loved even if temporarily there isn't sex, and to value those too.", "Nope, NTA.

This could be exploring with a sexologist why you are not having it regularly, making time for intimacy, making an effort to get in the mood.

Even your spouse or partner.", "I read your post in r/Divorce after reading this. This man has treated you poorly in a lot of ways for a long time. He also makes you feel guilty about not wanting sex and like you owe him sex. This is seriously concerning for you and your children. \n\nI understand you saying you don't want your kids to repeat your childhood, that he makes you laugh, and you have good times together, but those things are making you excuse poor and abusive behavior. What you've described about him are not things your children should grow up emulating or thinking is loving behavior. The things you describe are not markers of a healthy relationship. What you describe is someone who does not respect, care for, or value you as a wife, mother, friend, or human 100% of the time. \n\nEverything else aside and this post alone, this is concerning behavior. Yeah, it sucks to be in the mood only to have your partner decide they're not or no longer are, BUT it is never ok to make someone feel guilty about withdrawing consent. It is not OK to continue pushing when someone says no to sex. It's not OK to feel like you owe someone sex, either. Saying yes to sex is also not a promise or a contract. If you say yes earlier in the day or 5 minutes before, you are not obligated to still have those desires in the moment and can ALWAYS say no.\n\nOne sexual experience I had was the guy continuing to push and ask to the point where I went numb and stopped responding. He took that as consent. Years later, a therapist told me what that was. I always thought violence had to be involved for it to be considered that. Please do not let him push you, pressure you, or guilt you to where you go numb. 19 years later, it still affects me.\n\nNTA \n\nThink of how you want and deserve to be treated and think about the kind of relationship you want your kids to see growing up.", "He eventually stands down? He should stop the moment you say you don\u2019t want to do it anymore. He shouldn\u2019t be guilt tripping you", "You've been led so far down the rabbit hole. You don't even see the problem with what he's doing...\n6 weeks is minimal, by the way. Your body is not fully healed, and hormones are not back to normal level until 6 months...\nAdd in a newborn baby and parental fatigue. Mostly, it takes a good year to feel normal again. Your husband is participating in toxic male behavior to you. Of course, you're gonna come to his defense because all abuse victims do. Abuse comes in many different forms. All you're doing is repeating the cycle that you children will see and learn from. Maybe you don't care about yourself but think about them...", "Yeah but don\u2019t you think that the blame for the pre-negotiations lies on him for asking to have sex later? Just seems ridiculous to call someone an asshole for agreeing to sex then being too tired for it later. Especially seeing all the pressure he puts on her.", "Nothing about this sounds like a negotiation. It sounds like he's coming at her with demands, which she feels pressured to comply with regardless of how she really feels.", "This \ud83d\udcaf OP. It's your man who is in the wrong here, not you. Any thought process that starts with \"it's partly my fault because\" is wrong.", "There is no possible way to be an asshole to someone by revoking consent.", "Welp this descended into shit", "sounds like unhealthy behavior has been normalized to you", "People treat blue balls as a legitimate medical condition to guilt their partners into sex. It\u2019s gross.", "This is the video https://youtu.be/pZwvrxVavnQ", "Should op go the police?", "Should op go to the police?", "No, pre-negotiations involved both parties. Especially after knowing he reacts negatively to a change of mind, it would be logical to stop agreeing to sex ahead of time. \n\nThat being said, I do feel that if she were to eliminate the pre-negotiation factor, I have a feeling he would find another reason to pout about not getting any. As I said to OP, her partner needs to work on the concept of consent.", "So she should absolutely assert herself and reserve the right to decide when the time comes. She should not say yes ahead of time.", "Thank you so much!", "Never agree to have sex later because he might get mad if you change your mind is a toxic mentality. If she initiated it by promising head for his birthday and then was like meh I don\u2019t feel like it, I could understand him getting upset. It seems like him asking ahead of time is another tactic he uses to coerce her into sex, and you\u2019re blaming her for falling for his tactic.", "Look, even the law has established you can't obtain someone's sexual consent in advance and just whip it out later to try and get around them saying no. \n\nThere's a really big difference between a couple agreeing that they'd like to have sex later, and some sort of binding obligation. This happens all the time in relationships, sometimes you plan to have sex but one person feels tired or unwell or just not into it. It's not a big deal, there's always a next time.", "If you were living with an abusive man who blew up whenever he didn't get his way, maybe you'd see why OP tries to placate him. This is an abuse dynamic. If she asserts herself, he punishes her.", "It\u2019s a great video :)", "By your logic, promising head on his birthday then changing her mind and him getting upset would actually be no different and no more understandable.  His birthday doesn't change the rules of consent.\n\nAnd by your logic, she should continue to tell him yes when it's more like a maybe? Doesn't make sense.\n\nOP should assert her right to reserve her decisions to have sex. \n\nIf this is an issue of abuse and coercion, she should leave the relationship.", "Which is why he IS in the wrong, as I've clearly agreed. But if she's choosing him as a partner, and she knows how this plays out, why keep hitting repeat? If it had happened once or twice, then OK, it couldn't be reasonably foreseen. But repeating the same actions over and over and expecting a different result...", "OP should assert her right to reserve her decision from the start of the conversation. If that's a problem and the relationship truly is abusive, she should get out, no question there.", "I think it's honestly the best video explaining consent and is age appropriate for a younger audience as well but it also puts it in a really direct way. I just wish it covered d*ck pics too.", "You\u2019re not following my logic. The difference is her initiation and his intent in asking to have sex later. She never has said yes when it\u2019s a maybe, she\u2019s said yes when she was into it, then changed it to a no when she wasn\u2019t.", "OP has reasonably determined that there's a good chance she could change her mind later. So reasonably, don't say either way what you'll feel like doing later until, well, later."]}
