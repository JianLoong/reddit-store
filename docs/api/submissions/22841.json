I'd be reporting her.", "Oh yes and a big one at that. Why not call a rescue who would have picked up the puppy immediately? Why rush it to a dog pond that could be a kill shelter?

I dont like dogs either but I dont wish them to suffer or be killed.", "NTA. She had absolutely no business signing your family up for a long term personal and financial commitment without discussing it with you first. 100% her fault the kids are disappointed and she\u2019s a huge AH for dragging that poor dog through this escapade.", "NTA - Strange how your sister didn't think to ask you first. That's a big responsibility she thrust upon you because you are likely going to be the one taking the dog for walks, to the vet, feeding etc. Especially if she bought like a German Shepard puppy that will be huge in a year", "NTA\n\nFor being a dog-lover she sure doesn't treat a dog like it's a living being that you have to be responsible for.

Too many people don't have a backbone these days.", "You took it to the pound? Yeah you\u2019re a skunk dick", "NTA. One of the number one rules of giving gifts is that you don't give things that require upkeep unless people have explicitly indicated that they want them. Worse, she's trying to force you to keep it via emotional blackmail through your kids. Your response was a reasonable assertion of your boundaries, and you gave your sister an option to find an alternative solution to the mess you've made.

You never ever give someone a dog without asking first....never ever ever ever.  What was she thinking or expecting?", "NTA.  She should have asked first.  A pet is a responsibility not to be foisted upon someone without consent.   Sucks about the kids though, that wasn't fair their aunt did that to them.", "NTA a pet is a personal experience and a family member. The sister was reckless and was the one who selfishly got the puppy knowing the risk of rejection yet wasn\u2019t accountable for her actions. \nOn top of putting the puppy at risks she has also traumatised her nieces. Don\u2019t hate on the OP, this is all on his sister", "NTA - dogs deserve to live in a home where they are loved and wanted", "NTA. \n\nYour sister sure is. \n\nWho does that?

He\u2019s NTA for saying no, but he was an ass for taking the poor thing to a pound.

The kids are old enough to be taught how to care for animals. So unless the opposition to pets is a financial reason, this would be a great teachable moment. You can\u2019t deny your kids something just because you don\u2019t like it personally.\nWhat if your kids want to go to Disney world one day?

It was wrong for your sister to buy the dog and  gift it to your children.

You lied to your kids saying \"your aunt tricked you\" to absolve yourself of having to say that you just don't like dogs, that you will never allow them a pet etc. If you have no problem being the bad guy then you should have no problem owning up to why you are getting rid of the dog.", "NTA, but if you took it to a kill shelter that's incredibly fucked.

And there\u2019s a non-zero chance that pup has parvo or another disease, and the kids would have to watch it suffer. \n\nOP has a heart of stone, but that\u2019s no crime. Sister is the AH in setting the kids up for heartbreak. \n\nOP and wife should talk about pets for the kids, though.

Disney world is an experience. A dog is a long term commitment. \n\nThe parents don\u2019t want a dog. What happens if/when the kids get bored of the dog? The parents have to care for it. The dog will most likely end up neglected. \n\nGetting a dog without the parents consent is even worse. Especially with all the time, energy and money that goes into having a dog. \n\nThis scenario happened to me in a sort of way and I kept the dog and it was the worst experience. Of course I would care for the dog and I even grew to love it but it was a heavy burden that I wasn\u2019t prepared for. I was miserable and I was never home because of work and barley had any time for the dog. Eventually the person who left it with me took it back after I begged and begged for two years. It\u2019s not worth it. It was harmful to me and the dog. \n\nNow if the parents bought the dog themselves to let the kids try it would be different because then they could be more prepared mentally/physically/financially to take care of it. If they bought it and then got rid of it then I would say they were the assholes.

This has nothing to do with his sister trying to force them to get a pet. And not wanting one when you know you wouldn't care for one isn't 'evil'. It's being responsible. The only reason he might need to cite is that 'he never agreed', and that's way enough.", "I found a recommendation on nextdoor.  I don't believe their are kill shelters in my area anyway.", "Yep.  All of these \"no pound people\" should adopt the dog.  Puppies get adopted almost immediately though, they dog is probably already re-homed.

This was a choice taken away from both parents, so the right thing to do IS the right thing here.\n\nThis exactly. A dog is a huge commitment, and a lot of work and responsibility. Getting a dog when you aren't prepared to look after it properly generally results in a shitty life for the dog.  \n\n\nAs much as I disagree with taking it to the pound, it has a much better chance of being adopted while it's still a puppy and not a poorly socialized, untrained, neglected adult dog.", "In my experience. All of them fall in love with the dog and harbor 0 discontent. And are actually thankful. \n\nIn my opinion:\n\nNo, it absolutely was to make a point to his sister. She crossed his boundary and the retaliation for that in his mind, was only to get rid of the dog. It\u2019s obvious nothing entered his mind other than that, based on the phrasing he used when talking about his kids. The possibility of making his kids happy, swallowing his apathy towards dogs, and keeping it. Clearly didn\u2019t enter his mind. The welfare of the animal didn\u2019t enter his mind either. He brought it straight to the pound. Didn\u2019t try to re home it, didn\u2019t try to do anything responsible with regards to not keeping the dog. \n\nWhat he got for that was he played a part in hurting his kids, and possibly that animal. The sister definitely is the the asshole here. But he is not without blame either.", "You say parents instead of parent. So can you at least agree he should've discussed this with his wife instead of acting unilaterally?", "Sad for the kids and the dog. I hope it gets rescued.", "He shouldn't lie to his kids.

So when his boundary gets crossed he has to compromise because \u201coh think of the children\u201d. Naaaaaah don\u2019t think so.
