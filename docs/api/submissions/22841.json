One of the number one rules of giving gifts is that you don't give things that require upkeep unless people have explicitly indicated that they want them. Worse, she's trying to force you to keep it via emotional blackmail through your kids.

Just because you and your wife had some sort of negative experience with dogs, doesn't mean your kids should have to deal with your baggage. But if you really can't stand the thought of having a dog, you could have at least waited a day so you could get your sister to tell you where she got it from and take it back there.

However, it should be a dog that OP and his wife agree on with house rules the family agrees to, not a random puppy pushed on them.

Not the way she set this up.  She did know her brother and his wife didn't want a dog.  So she figured she'd create a situation in which they would be forced to keep the dog, or be huge assholes (in her eyes).  That's why she took the girls out, and got the puppy then, rather than trying to show up to the house with a puppy.  She figured that OP and his wife wouldn't be able to say no once they realized the girls were attached.  That they'd give in, to spare the girls' feelings.

The girls' parents not being there at all should have raised red flags -- unless the sister was just lying her ass off left and right.  Or, of course, she bought the puppy from someone who isn't reputable at all, and doesn't think to check on what kind of household the puppy is going to, and whether the children's parents are okay with it.)\n\n(Also -- what kind of place did she buy it from, that would not take the puppy back, had she -- or OP -- gone in to return it the same day, saying \"there's been a mistake\"?

They require more resources than adult dogs, they can't be walked on the ground because they're susceptible to things like parvo so they either have to have their own area of the shelter or they need to be carried, and they are much more likely to get sick since they can't be vaccinated.

It's the grooming, vaccines, and vet bills.  It costs about $200 every time I take them for their checkups and vaccines.  One of them had kidney failure a couple of years ago and the vet told me there was nothing we could do.  So, more $$$ for the euthanasia.  Then there is all the caring.  Dogs eat stuff they shouldn't and get sick.  You don't want to be out walking a sick dog at 3 in the morning... I am thankful my dog that we still have will run through the house barking when she's sick and doesn't leave a mess to clean up in the house, but really, 3 a.m.?\n\nWe haven't even mentioned the cost of all the stuff dogs chew up in their first year because they are teething.

Also unless you're going to train dog to go everywhere, then there is the cost of boarding when you go on vacation.\n\nYour daughters are old enough to understand money.  If they had the puppy, then the money you could have spent for their birthday gifts, Christmas gifts, new school supplies, clothes, etc would have been less because you would have had to pay for food and to replace their things that the puppy will chew up, because puppies chew!  \n\nLife isn't fair, so sorry your daughters are sad.  \n\nI love my dog, but when she's gone, no more.\n\nNTA!", "I second everything that's already been said, and I will be the one who also says:\n\nI think your sister sadly just lost the ability to spend time with your daughters unsupervised, if at all.

You were pissed and you took some of that out on your kids and the puppy.  It\u2019s not wrong to  be clear that we you\u2019re not keeping the puppy, but where was your effort to take it back to where they got it, find an actual no kill shelter, ask friends or find a rescue?  Yes, you got screwed with this situation, but as a parent this was a teaching opportunity.  The kids could have done some google searches, been part of the clean up crew and part of the process of rehousing the dog, as opposed to you popping off all pissed off a dropping it off at the nearest shelter without even knowing if it was a kill shelter.  you still aren\u2019t sure about that and a simple internet search or phone call could determine this, I hope they didn\u2019t euthanize the puppy.  \n\nAnd telling the kids that their aunt tricked them was not right way to explain what happened.  What their aunt did was not get your permission to bring a puppy home, especially knowing this was not an option for your home for many reasons that Mom and Dad have.  And she knew this and thought that she could make a decision for Mom and Dad that she was not entitled to make.  That is what you needed to actually say, because that is actually what happened.  And it also set you kids up for loving something you were never able to keep.  This is a learning opportunity that some decisions are for Mom and Dad to make, not aunts, neighbors, or little kids.  And you are so sorry that they are sad and upset, but this is why you ask Mom and Dad first.  The kids need to understand that it\u2019s not their decision either.  And mom and Dad have lots of reasons for not having a puppy, but it is a mom and dad decision to make, not an aunt, and not your kids, Mom and Dad only.  \n\nYour sister was a total ass for doing this, but your kids should have known better too.  My sister and I were in a similar situation as kids, around the same age, we were sad.

I grabbed him, fished the pill out, and now I\u2019m extra careful with my medicine.", "I understand your position but I have to ask you to reconsider, not specifically for this dog but for a pet in general. As a father I dismissed all requests of my two girls for a dog or a cat because of the nuisance. Last year I rescued a kitten and she's our live in cat. She's had such a positive impact on all of us that I fully regret depriving my girls the chance to have a pet since they were toddlers.", "Nta for not keeping a dog you didn't want\n\nBut yta for taking it to a pound.

They take time an energy, and if you are not 100% in on the project of owning one it's never gonna be a good experience for either pet or owner.\nShe should have talked to you and your wife before the purchase. She is the one who broke your girls hearts, even though it was you who brought them the news.\nYour sister is a selfish person who doesn't see others view. And for that matter a person who doesn't take responsibility for her actions.\nI would have been more than furious, if that happened to me. \nHope she comes to her senses and apologies, to the hole family.", "NTA. \n\nFor being a dog mom, she is pretty cruel trying to force another living thing into someone\u2019s lives without them being aware of it. \n\nThe only way I can see being \u201cgifted\u201d a pet as reasonable is if you\u2019ve discussed it with the person who would be the recipient and seeing if they were 100% on board. As in \u201cHey, I saw this puppy here - want me to get it for you?\u201d\n\nAlso, never \u201cgift\u201d in this fashion with your kids - even if they say yes, they\u2019re kids and likely don\u2019t think about ALL the responsibilities that come with having a pet.

The fact of the matter is that he are considered in every decision I make.

I\u2019m a dog lover myself but i know you don\u2019t just spring a dog onto someone like that. That\u2019s a decision you need to make yourself. I\u2019m sorry you had to have that conversation with your girls.", "NTA. You can't be expected to take on both a significant cost and time commitment without being asked first.

She was majorly out of line, not only for treating the puppy like a gift instead of a living creature, but first and foremost for putting the kids in the middle of this and vilifying you in their eyes.

I would be livid too and would consider how involved I want her to be in my kids' lives (doesn't mean 0 involvement but some serious boundaries might be needed). If there is any small comfort, it's good you checked that there is no kill shelters nearby and puppies generally get adopted pretty fast so it shouldn't be staying in the shelter for too long.", "It's fine that you didn't keep the dog. The bit about \"your aunt tricked you\" is what makes YTA. You could have handled that a lot better.", "NTA.

Dogs should never be presents especially if someone has said they dont want a dog! Sounds like your sister shouldn't have unsupervised time with your kids", "NTA\n\nThe only concern I do have is that you \"don't believe there are kill shelters in your area anyway\", but you did not take the time to confirm whether your belief was factually correct.

That was actually unthinkingly cruel of her, particularly since she is fully aware of your unwillingness to take on the care and training of a pet.

Apart from the obvious point that it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s place to make a decision that will impact you for more than a decade, she also didn\u2019t give you the opportunity to research the pup before choosing it. A friend got a pup (from a private individual - probably puppy farmed) which took ill and died within a week of being brought home. Imagine how your kids would have felt if that had happened. Getting a puppy is a huge decision with lots of different considerations. Your sister needs to grow up.", "NTA. I would prefer the puppy go back to the breeder so they can find it a good home that's ready for it, but I understand that may not be an option here.

Your sister is a serious problem with a capital P.", "ESH, except your children and this poor animal.\n\nI might get downvoted for the judgement, but hear me out.\n\nYou were justified.\n\nYour sister is obviously an AH for \"gifting\" you a puppy without your permission. An AH to you, your family and this puppy.\n\nYou are not the AH because you didn't want the puppy. You are the AH because you snapped and didn't do research or take into consideration other avenues of making sure the puppy was placed in the best situation  possible.\n\nBefore bringing the puppy to an animal shelter, I would have first looked into taking it to a local veteranian clinic and explaining the situation to them. You could have told them that you weren't sure about where the puppy should be released to so it had the best opportunity to thrive moving forward.\n\nVeterinarian clinics are more knowledgeable about this landscape than the average person. They may have more connections to and contact with rescuers and similar organizations that could have made sure that the dog was placed in the most appropriate environment. It could have been the shelter, but they also may have been able to contact a temporary foster or someone similar.\n\nLots of humane societies are appointment based surrenders only now, so there's no way for you to drop off an animal on a whim. At least that's the case where I'm located. \n\nAnd most of these shelters are currently battling overflow, and no kill shelters are actually a myth. They all euthanize animals. So at the end of the day, your sister is an AH for putting the dog in the situation, but you are also one for potentially bringing it to a location where it could be killed. People have this misconception that puppies are oftentimes the first dogs adopted, but oftentimes they might be the first dogs euthanized on intake because they don't have space.", "YTA for the pound.  You couldn't even be bothered to ensure it is a no kill shelter.  It was your sister you were mad at, not the puppy.

Holy Shit, you aren't even in the same galaxy as TA. Aunt Dumbass on the other hand, is a huge, mega, super A.

A pet of ANY kind is NOT a \u201cgift,\u201d it\u2019s an expensive, time-consuming, years-long commitment, and NEVER something you can choose for anyone else. \nYour sister did a stupid, thoughtless, inappropriate thing, which caused hurt and disappointment to your kids. You are 100% correct to blame her for them feeling so bad. I could almost understand someone doing such a thing if the DIDN\u2019T have pets, but someone who DOES have pets has no excuse whatsoever for this, as they know perfectly well that it\u2019s a huge and costly commitment. \n\nI actually even extend this to ANY \u201cgift\u201d that requires significant further action on the part of a recipient: gifts that have to be assembled or need ongoing maintenance, or gift cards to stores that are not close to where the recipient lives or shops, kits for arts & crafts (unless you KNOW they are wanted), etc. A gift should not incur further obligations, and a pet is at the far, far end of that spectrum.", "YTA puppies may not be presents but this one could have been returned to where it came from and not dunped at the pound, it's a living being.

Vet is about $150/year and then preventative meds are $180/ 6 months. That's $1,100/year with NO medical conditions. Now multiply that by the number of years the dog may live as well as add any \"pet hotel\" or dogsitting fees for out of town adventures. Add up the cost of paying your rental company (if you rent) and any unexpected expenses and you've got a thing that cost tens of thousands in the end.", "Funny you should mention that...had to take one of mine to the vet yesterday after I found pieces of my husband's ($300.00) pair of sunglasses, he had apparently knocked off the counter and didn't realize it.

I meant more as in a surprise gift.  there's nothing wrong with offering a pet to someone, or offering to go look for one with them and pay the adoption or purchase fee.  But, not to just give one unasked.  Even if you know someone wants a dog, you shouldn't just go and get one.  It might not have the right personality or size or whatever.
