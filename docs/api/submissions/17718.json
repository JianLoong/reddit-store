They are children who are growing up and make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes hurt other people's feelings.\n\nPretend for a second that there is no other house for her to go to. The two girls are just normal sisters. Would you send one of the girls out of the house because she's not getting along with her sister?

I won't call a child an AH.", "This is a huge overreaction and not appropriate at all.", "As a former 13 year old, I can say with confidence that a lot of things I said and did back then I would never dream of doing now because of how mean/rude they were, and I didn't realize it at the time. It isn't an excuse and she should absolutely be punished but hey, some kids really are that oblivious", "Being sent away from her dad is not the appropriate consequence though.\nWhat if her mom wants to send her away when she\u2019s rude at her house?\nWhere does she go ?\nI don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting no consequence", "she's 13 not 15", "13*", "The fact that she wouldn't apologize... that is the worst part. Don't send her away, but she should have consequences at your home.", "Not all kids learn at the same rate. My sister has some mild learning disabilities and didn't understand the extent of how rude she was until it started biting her in the ass as an adult.", "Not sure this is being deliberately being rude though, just a description of what it looked like to her? I mean OP doesn't mention tone of voice other than to say sometimes that Bri can be judgmental. And I think the father is right here why not give the opportunity to parent here instead of just sending her back? This could have been an instance of mispeaking rather than intentional insult.", "I actually was thinking the exact same thing. My 5 year old would know enough not to say that, and if she did and we explained why someone's tummy is big from medicine she would instantly apologize and feel awful she hurt someone's feelings.", "Well said.", "I would still don't call her an AH. Her daughter is sick and it must be hard to fear for the life of your child.", "What should happen is Dad hands down some discipline to his kid.  Bri doubling down is concerning, and it's high time she learns the value of faking an apology to keep the peace.", "Not sure what of handed is, doesn't make much sense to me, Bugs Bunny. \n\nIts a home she shares with her Dad, Step Mum and Step sister, she doesn't pay the bills, she doesn't own the house. \n\nAbusing an ill cancer patient is okay in your judgement. The mother has every right to defend her daughter. The Dad isn't punishing his daughter, and doesn't show empathy, if I was the mother that would be a deal breaker for me. OP is NTA. The Dad and the Step-daughter are TAs", "13 year olds can absolutely be assholes.", "What in the comment you replied to, do you think is inappropriate or an overreaction?", "You don\u2019t kick a child out for being rude. Teenagers are rude sometimes.", "But this girl is 15... wouldn't doubt they've had the bullying talk at school once or twice", "That's why I said ESH not Y T A, it was a difficult situation for sure but she's asking for clarification on whether her response to it was fair or not and I can't say it was, it was an understandable response but not actually 100% the best response. I'm not commenting on her as a person but her and the step daughter's actions in this instance.", "They meant off handed.", "So this was a one-time thing, likely because the kid was understandably shocked and you as parents failed to prepare her appropriately? This is the first comment she\u2019s made and now you want to throw her out of her home. Addy is obviously a priority here but did anyone stop to think about how the situation might affect Bri? To see her sister got through something like cancer and all it brings is going to affect her. She is a CHILD. This is likely her first truly up close experience with a medical emergency and all the emotions it brings. Let\u2019s give the kid a little grace and help through the situation before you deem her a lost cause to boot out of her own home.", "They can act like AHs, yes. But as I said, I am unwilling to label a child an AH.", "Bro is 13 but still should know better at this age than to  say hurtful things and to willingly apologize.", "Yeah, fair.", "Of course teenagers have compassion, they also have every other big emotion and impulse every other person has, but they have all these emotions and feelings without the benefit of fully formed brains or the life experience to fully contextualize these feelings. \n\nThere is not a person in this world who has not said something shitty and then doubled down on it out of anger/spite/jealousy/frustration/etc. to pretend there is would simply be a straw man argument. \n\nOf course Addy is going through something terrible and needs all the love and all the support, I don\u2019t think anyone is arguing with you on that. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that Bri has been feeling left out or unsupported with Addy getting the lion share of the attention during her illness. Does that excuse the comment? Of course not. But it can help explain it. No one is able to be compassionate and caring 100% of the time, especially not a young teenager. \n\nI\u2019m curious if you would advocate for kicking this girl out of her home if both daughters were full biological daughters of the OP and their partner. \n\nSiblings are going to squabble, even if one of those siblings is sick. It\u2019s not realistic to expect otherwise.", ">So what would you think is appropriate if this was her own house and there was no second house? Where would you suggest you send her then? Boarding school over one really shitty remark?\n\nShe can stay with a grandparent or aunt until she can learn to be a decent human.  \n\nThis wasn't a shitty remark it was cruel and she doubled down instead of apologizing and has gotten away with it.\n\nAdi needs all her mental strength and fortitude to fight.  She is the priority right now.  Having someone in the home making cruel and cutting comments when they should be a source of support undermines her mental health and fortitude.  \n\n>Yes. The sick kid needs all the love and care and attention. But when there is a second kid, they need to be taken care of as well.\n\nShe can be cared for at her moms house.  She is actively harmful to her step sister.  \n\n>Because if you do, the message is not \u2018you said something awful\u2019. The message becomes \u2018you don\u2019t belong here\u2019. And that\u2019s quite judgmental, like her man is supposed to be. \n\n\nOr...actions have consequences.  Sometimes they are severe.  \n\nYou don't need to say everything you're thinking all the time. \n\nOr when you're not a decent human sometimes people won't want you around.", "Ok, I don\u2019t care what you\u2019d be willing to do. A 13 year old can be an asshole and should be labeled as such when they are one. And being terrible to your step sibling with cancer makes you an asshole.", "Sorry I got them confused", ">Of course teenagers have compassion, they also have every other big emotion and impulse every other person has, but they have all these emotions and feelings without the benefit of fully formed brains or the life experience to fully contextualize these feelings. \n\n\nAnd then she refused to apologize.  After watching another human with a deadly disease burst into tears.  \n\nLOL. I'm starting to see how a lot of you are raising future bullies. \n\n>There is not a person in this world who has not said something shitty and then doubled down on it out of anger/spite/jealousy/frustration/etc. to pretend there is would simply be a straw man argument. \n\n\nLOL.  Again just because you raised awful humans doesn't mean everyone is an awful human who revels in the suffering of others. \n\n*but everyone does it* is the universal calling card of terrible humans everywhere. \n\n\n>Of course Addy is going through something terrible and needs all the love and all the support, I don\u2019t think anyone is arguing with you on that. \n\n\nIf you want to leave a terrible and cruel 13 year old in the house with her to make asshole comments that you can handwave away then yeah you are arguing the point. \n\n>I\u2019m curious if you would advocate for kicking this girl out of her home if both daughters were full biological daughters of the OP and their partner. \n\nIs absolutely advocate for her spending an extended amount of time with another family member since her comments affect addys health and well being and that needs to be the priority.  And Bri clearly doesn't care about that. \n\n>Siblings are going to squabble, even if one of those siblings is sick. It\u2019s not realistic to expect otherwise.\n\nThat you're chalking one kid calling demeaning the appearance of the other when its a side effect of chemotherapy as she fights a deadly disease at an age where she is worried about her appearance and doubles down and refuses to apologize a, \"squabble\" tells me all I need to know about the person you are and the children you're raising.", "Then go talk to someone else? You questioned my comment, I've explained my position.", "You are judging this 13 year old child pretty harshly based on the one sixty second encounter you heard she had. \n\nThat\u2019s great compassion you\u2019re showing.", ">You are judging this 13 year old child pretty harshly based on the one sixty second encounter you heard she had. \n\nSometimes one time is all it takes. \n\n>That\u2019s great compassion you\u2019re showing.\n\nCompassion for someone who would pick on a cancer patients appearance and then double down?  Yeah.  No."]}
