And asked Bri to apologize she told us she wasn't going to apologize because it's true Addy does look pregnant and that's not my fault. \n\nI told my husband Bri isn't staying with us if she's treating Addy like that. He thought it was unfair I wanted Bri to go when he only gets to see her every other week.

You for suggesting she go back to her mom's house as if that is her only home. She lives half of the time with her dad, her dad's home is her home.

If Addy upsets Bri is it okay with you for your husband to insist she be removed from the home? \n\nYour husband for not disciplining his child. \n\nIs there any chance Bri is on the spectrum or has some other social/emotional struggles? Insisting that she is telling the truth and having an observation like that out loud with no filter doesn't sound judgmental, it sounds like she is struggles with social niceties.", "Mmmmm\u2026it\u2019s understandable for you to feel a bit hypervigilant considering what your daughter\u2019s going through, but immediately sending her back is a bit harsh. \n\nDad needs to have a serious talk with her, especially after refusing to apologize. Poor girl\u2019s going through enough without her sister being a mean girl on top of it", "ESH. \nBro was out of line but I don\u2019t know many 13 year olds that are that way about social interactions unless they are on the spectrum. \n\nYes Bri needs a talking to but you can\u2019t make her leave her home. How would you handle this if there was no other home for her?  That\u2019s how it should be handled now.", "YTA\n\nWhen the child of two parents who have joint custody is with one of those parents, it is as if they live there full time. You don't just get to send the kid back to the other parent because you don't like the way they are acting.\n\nThe reality is that siblings, whether they are biological or siblings due to marriage, do not always get along. They are children who are growing up and make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes hurt other people's feelings.\n\nPretend for a second that there is no other house for her to go to. The two girls are just normal sisters. Would you send one of the girls out of the house because she's not getting along with her sister? Or she said something insensitive to her sister?\n\nOf course you wouldn't. You and your husband would discipline her accordingly. Given that she is your stepdaughter, perhaps you should not be involved in the discipline. Your husband should discipline her.\n\nThe point is, it is an asshole move to try to expel a child from her house. When it is her week there with her dad, that is her house. She lives there. You don't kick a child out of their house.", "ESH you seem to fundamentally misunderstand how dual household parenting works, both places are her home, she's not just a guest 'visiting' your family and to treat her otherwise is very bad. On the other hand what she said was really out of line and the double down on not apologising, while probably just over defensive teenage energy at work, was very uncool. \n\nThe only innocents here are Adi and the husband who were just caught in the middle.", "YTA. It\u2019s her home too. You don\u2019t kick a child out for being rude. Teenagers are rude sometimes. She should be disciplined but not removed from her own home.  You clearly do not feel that your stepdaughter is part of your family or you wouldn\u2019t even suggest it. I\u2019m sure she picks up on that and is acting out as a result.", "YTA.  You can't tell your husband that his child matters less than yours.  She is **his** daughter and family, you have no right to exclude her from the home.  It would be best if you talked with her individually and together about how her behavior is expected in the home.  She should have consequences for her actions.  You don't, however, tell your husband his daughter isn't welcome in his home.", "YTA her comment was uncalled for but she still lives there. You wanting to pack her up and send her back is sending her a message that she isn\u2019t family and she is a guest in a home that belongs to her dad.\n\nThis a sure way for your husband to loose custody of his daughter.\n\nShould she have been punished? Yes. \n\nBut you can not ban a child from their Holme because they make a comment you do not like.", "ESH.

But banishing her from your home like this will do so much more harm than good.   That\u2019s the kind of rejection that really sticks.

She is going through such an intensive fight for her life and doesn't need to hear the musing of an immature and cruel preteen.

You\u2019re judging bri because of what her mother did. \n Yes, 13 year olds say dumb things. And are totally convinced that they are right because\u2026.

That you can send people away when they\u2019re not perfect. You\u2019ve shown her that you are the judge in your house and that whenever she says something utterly stupid, you send her off.
