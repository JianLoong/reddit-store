They are children who are growing up and make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes hurt other people's feelings.\n\nPretend for a second that there is no other house for her to go to. The two girls are just normal sisters. Would you send one of the girls out of the house because she's not getting along with her sister?

Given that she is your stepdaughter, perhaps you should not be involved in the discipline.

Yes. \n\nBut you can not ban a child from their Holme because they make a comment you do not like.", "ESH.
