When is the last time you were nude in front of him?", "NTA. You told your husband because it was a normal professional interaction, and your therapist acted professionally by not talking about his clients.

It doesn\u2019t matter if she \u201cfelt like a blob\u201d, she was still completely naked during a massage. An activity that could also be erotic/sensual in nature. The comparisons to estheticians are moot because those appointments last all of 5-10 minutes and are typically painful.\n\nThe gall for OP to then say that she wishes her husband had been more discreet is appalling. What if he had been completely naked (uncovered) with a female massage therapist? I suspect she wouldn\u2019t be so happy!", "Thanks! That all makes a lot of sense.

I really no longer care if my masseuse sees my nether regions. It just seems like a weird thing for his wife to be upset about. Are you going to mad at your spouse the nurse for seeing people naked? It just seems like part of the gig.", "Okay\u2026 but then to make a weird passive aggressive comment aimed at the spouse of the other person? You\u2019re calling that normal?

I was glad he didn't turn away in disgust! lol", "There is reason. I normally wear panties when getting a massage for relaxation but when I injured my lower back my RMT had to work on my glutes a lot. She left it up to me but was straight forward in that full nudity would allow her to work more effectively when massaging the area.", "I used to work for Massage Envy. Only front desk, but we still had to learn all the procedures. It was all built on the assumption of nudity under the sheet. There were specific ways to fold the sheet to only expose the section the therapist was working on. \n\nWhen I got a massage at the hotel I was staying at in Spain a couple years back, it worked similarly, but they gave me something to contain my bits. It concealed nothing - it was basically the thong version of a disposable sock you might try on a shoe with - but it kept anything from flopping around during sheet adjustments.", "There is actually.  If they\u2019re working your butt underwear gets on the way.  They\u2019ll never require but for certain muscles and such it\u2019s far better to go without", "It is 100% the norm to be naked for a massage.

It's you can still get therapeutically touch but I never give hip relief guarantee unless the client is nude. There's just no way to have the same effectiveness.

Anyone that tells you differently is full of it.", "The part that isn't normal was having no sheet covering me.", "If OP is from the US, puritanical cultural undertones remain very strong, and unfortunately it's hard for many to separate nudity from sexuality (stupid as that is).

You clearly haven't ever had one. Husband didn't get details,  wife freaked over an allusion.", "Awww lol of course he didn\u2019t! But that\u2019s amazing you got some relief. 8 months in and knowing you have at least one more month, possibly a few more weeks on top of that, to go is rough.", "That\u2019s overstating things considerably. It\u2019s not normal or abnormal, it\u2019s about personal preference. I\u2019ve always worn bottoms and when I have a new therapist they usually say to undress to what I\u2019m comfortable with before leaving the room. My friends wear bottoms, my pre-Covid therapist (miss her\u2026) used to talk shop during sessions said it was rare in her clientele to go fully nude.
