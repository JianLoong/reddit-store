It doesn\u2019t matter if she \u201cfelt like a blob\u201d, she was still completely naked during a massage. An activity that could also be erotic/sensual in nature. The comparisons to estheticians are moot because those appointments last all of 5-10 minutes and are typically painful.\n\nThe gall for OP to then say that she wishes her husband had been more discreet is appalling.

Only front desk, but we still had to learn all the procedures. It was all built on the assumption of nudity under the sheet. There were specific ways to fold the sheet to only expose the section the therapist was working on. \n\nWhen I got a massage at the hotel I was staying at in Spain a couple years back, it worked similarly, but they gave me something to contain my bits. It concealed nothing - it was basically the thong version of a disposable sock you might try on a shoe with - but it kept anything from flopping around during sheet adjustments.", "There is actually.

My friends wear bottoms, my pre-Covid therapist (miss her\u2026) used to talk shop during sessions said it was rare in her clientele to go fully nude.
