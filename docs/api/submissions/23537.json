It doesn\u2019t matter if she \u201cfelt like a blob\u201d, she was still completely naked during a massage. An activity that could also be erotic/sensual in nature. The comparisons to estheticians are moot because those appointments last all of 5-10 minutes and are typically painful.\n\nThe gall for OP to then say that she wishes her husband had been more discreet is appalling.

Only front desk, but we still had to learn all the procedures. It was all built on the assumption of nudity under the sheet. There were specific ways to fold the sheet to only expose the section the therapist was working on. \n\nWhen I got a massage at the hotel I was staying at in Spain a couple years back, it worked similarly, but they gave me something to contain my bits.

It was David\u2019s job as a massage therapist to inform you that you\u2019re required to have something covering you, a towel, a sheet, something. To avoid any legal complications. He could\u2019ve also turned up the ac in his area to make you more comfortable and he didn\u2019t. He should\u2019ve never continued the massage post nudity no covering.", "NTA.

Hopefully, the therapist and the wife are on good terms again soon.", "You\u2019re the only one NTA. I\u2019m an er nurse, so I see people naked all the time. Once at a bbq I met a guy that remembered me as his nurse (I have no recall of him whatsoever, again I see a ton of naked people). Apparently he\u2019d had some sort of problem with his groin area to the degree that I was checking a femoral pulse often. He only mentioned it all to thank me for the care I gave & make a joke about it being the most attention his junk had received from a woman in a while (he was gay, I am pretty humorous with my patients when I can be & the joke he made was totally ok). Our husbands laughed & we continued on talking about concerts or something & went on with our night. It was understood by all involved that the circumstances were in a professional setting to address a need & not sexual, this situation is the same. Your husband is obviously still uncomfortable & the massage therapist friend flubbed it by not communicating with his spouse that he regularly deals in naked people, including friends & people they may run into. His spouse is insecure & I question her intelligence for not making the basic connection that massage therapists literally rub naked bodies professionally. \n\nI would tell your husband to develop some social awareness or at least STFU about completely normal stuff.", "Not the AH. \n\nI\u2019m a Myotherapist and preggy clients overheating is fairly common, generally try to drape but sometimes things like that happen. Some people will come in for a neck issue and get completely nude, others don\u2019t even take a shirt off. I\u2019ve generally assumed it\u2019s either a cultural thing or a practical issue where they don\u2019t want oil/cream getting on their clothes (undies) You\u2019re well within your rights to tell your husband any details.

Why are you so concerned that you are the asshole for David getting himself in trouble? Something just seems off, your comments about \u201cnot his brightest moment,\u201d \u201cI wish he wouldn\u2019t have said anything,\u201d etc and that you texted David to \u201cgive him a heads up\u201d seems a bit weird, why not \u201cI followed up with David after a reasonable time?\u201d Even if you knew both him and his wife. This is a professional relationship that became casual, not friendship and based off the wife\u2019s reaction that confirms that. Seems your more upset your husband divulged something you knew would upset his wife, because you knew something was going on (not saying you were what\u2019s going on).", "Not your finest moment either. \n\nYTA OP. Most states (probably all but I only know mine and the surrounding), have rules for massage therapists. The main one being a client must be draped at all times.\n\nSo while you may nude under that sheet, you ditching that sheet could\u2019ve cost him his license. Your husband and his asshole joke, could\u2019ve cost him his license if the wrong person over heard and reported him to the board. Why did David even allow it?!?! He did you a favor that he shouldn\u2019t have done. \n\nI get why you told your husband, but the two of you need to learn to keep your asshole mouths shut outside of your private conversation. He Could\u2019ve lost his Life\u2019s work bc of you two. Both of you need to learn to be quiet. \n\nAs far as the people saying David should\u2019ve told his wife, most massage therapists, cosmetologists and aestheticians don\u2019t tell our spouses everything. It\u2019s not hiding anything, it\u2019s keeping our clients confidential. Now if OP had been hitting on him while naked, dropped the sheet with bad intentions then yeah, he should\u2019ve told her.", "well apparently it was necessary, because David's wife didn't know, funny how that works.", "sometimes, your comfort isn't the most important thing. You put your massage therapist is a rough situation, and almost seem proud about it.", "\u201cThat conclusion\u201d meaning?\nNeed more info, sorry", "Then he should stick to his day job. There was nothing funny about his comment.", "What's a \"hurtle\"?", "Where did she say she has been nude before, in the post she directly states this was the first time she has been nude in front of him.", "A registered massage therapist is a medical professional, they don\u2019t discuss what happens in a session with their spouses. Do you think a gynaecologist goes home and tells his wife about all of the vaginas he saw over the course of the day?  It would be a breach of medical ethics and privacy.", "I don't need to know every time my partnerchanges clothes in the changing room at work, nor if there is someone showering in the stall next to him and he happens to walk past. I don't need to tell my partner every time I watch porn, and I don't want to know when they do.\n\nI don't need to be told if they see someone tanning shirtless in the park, either.  I'd assume that a massage therapist sees a lot of skin, both thinly covered and not. Same for a number of professions.\n\nNudity itself just isn't a big deal in all areas. I'm in Northern Europe, and it really isn't a big deal here like it was in the US. If you want your partner to let you know whenever they see someone naked, you should really discuss that with them. I'd leave.", "Depending on where he is there might be confidentiality laws. I\u2019m a Myotherapist and I\u2019m not supposed to talk about any specific details regarding my treatments to anyone. \n\nSo if my girlfriends friend was a client I\u2019d not be able to talk about that treatment to my partner.

It simply came off that they have one another\u2019s numbers and OP wanted to let him know that his wife seemed upset after the encounter.", "From what i can tell, you're claiming there's something suspicious about what she did.

Even less so when trying to keep covered up is annoying wheni just want to get the test done and move on. The first time I got a massage was years after and they were a different gender. They told the policies and everything was adhered to but again it's a body and I surprisingly didn't care again.\n\nBodies get sexualized and/or critiqued way too much. It's anatomy. Unless someone is secretly a ghost we all have bodies.i understand why some may not be comfortable with that or have additional reasons to wanting to stay covered but for the average person it's not a big deal.", "It wouldn't be a breach unless identifying (personal) information was released. Talking about the state of vagina's or boobies doesn't actually disclose confidential info or identify individuals.", "It could depend on the country but from my understanding, you could discuss them if you leave out any details that could lead to identification.", "I feel like we\u2019re addressing very different examples. I didn\u2019t mean all nudity, and I apologize if it came off that way. For example: seeing others at the beach or pool is fine. It\u2019s a public area where you expect swimsuits and such. Watching porn, too, is a private affair that I don\u2019t believe in placing restrictions on. There are many instances where it\u2019s expected or normal, like the changing rooms you mentioned as well.\n\nHowever, in situation where nudity isn\u2019t expected, I would like to know if it occurred. If my partner is in a room alone with someone and they undress, I would like to be informed as to why. It sounds like in this specific situation, covering while receiving a massage is the norm. If someone fully uncovers, which is outside of the norm, I feel it\u2019s something worth addressing. I would tell my partner if something \u201coutside the norm\u201d happened to me, and I fully trust he\u2019d tell me as well.\n\nThat being said, this varies per relationship and what each couple is comfortable with. My relationship boundaries are likely very different than yours. In this situation, however, it sounds like David crossed an established boundary he knew his wife had. Instead of communicating with her and reaching a solution, like OP did, he decided to cross it and continue doing so without her knowledge. It\u2019s up to you what you allow and would want to be informed of in your own relationships. I\u2019m just saying it seems clear a boundary was crossed here, and if David had addressed it with his partner, I don\u2019t believe it would have been an issue.", "A little different, but my husband is a native New Orleanian and when we visit, especially during high tourist months, it\u2019s not uncommon to see topless women walking around. \n\nI think if he told me every time he saw a topless woman roaming the streets, I\u2019d wonder if he\u2019d regressed back into a teenage boy. \n\nI think the possible worry here for OP\u2019s masseuse is his text back to her. That implies to me that they may be going through something, or maybe he hasn\u2019t been faithful before and this just stirred up more problems for them.", "> It was all built on the assumption of nudity under the sheet. There were specific ways to fold the sheet to only expose the section the therapist was working on.\n\nBut OP wasn\u2019t under the sheets, she was just exposed.", "Yeah, I am a myotherapist/massage therapist in Australia with 13 years experience and gotta tell you if you can't release the glutes while just moving underwear out of the way then you are doing it wrong. My clients always have underpants on and if women feel more comfortable leaving their bra on, then it is my job to work around it. If I found a client was naked I would request they get dressed and leave. All through training, everywhere I have worked and now I work for myself, clients leave their underpants on.", "Being naked is the norm, being completely *uncovered* is NOT the norm. Wtf are you guys all just flapping your dick around while they try to massage you?

Idk her at all right so I\u2019m not gonna accuse her of cheating. \n\nBut based on the facts (as she claims) of the story and how they were presented, trusting her is not a given- there\u2019s need for consideration, and you\u2019d need to consider a lot, not worth the energy. \n\nshe felt the need to discuss what has happened, sign of a guilty conscience, after her husband could tell something was in the air, he smelled it coming, yikes. that\u2019s one tip.", "The whole point of the post is that OP ditched the sheet, which David\u2019s wife didn\u2019t know about.
