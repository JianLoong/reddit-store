I reminded him about it and he got angry because he was busy playing video games and didn\u2019t feel like doing it today. Him forgetting he has plans is getting old so I told him he shouldn\u2019t make commitments he can\u2019t keep.

Your fianc\u00e9 doesn't have trouble remembering anything--he has trouble *doing* it and uses \"I forgot\" as a perpetual excuse.  Your conversation with him while he was gaming proves this.\n\nStop reminding him.  Let him suffer the consequences of his own self-centeredness.", "As someone with ADHD who perpetually forgets things I have committed to - you are NTA. I realized long ago that if I don\u2019t write it down I will forget it. If he wanted to stop disappointing people, he would, but instead he thinks people will just keep accepting his excuses. These days we have phones with reminder apps and calendars in the palm of our hands, there really isn\u2019t an excuse. Don\u2019t remind him anymore and make sure he knows that\u2019s his business if he tries to blame you for not reminding him in the future.", "NTA. Next time he snaps at you have him write a little note declaring that he does not want you to remind him about things and wants you to stay out of his business. Have him date and sign it. Laminate it. Pull it out the next time he asks why you didn't remind him.", "NTA but you are not his mom. Plus, he doesn't need his mum around anymore. He can write his plans on his calendar.", "NTA. Is he just immature, or does he have an actual diagnosis that he needs help with? In any case, I feel sorry for you that you cannot depend on this man. That will indeed get old pretty quickly.", "NTA, he's an adult, he could use a calendar, a phone or his own memory to remember important dates, you're his partner, not his keeper.", "Your boyfriend doesn't have a memory problem.  He has a \"other people are unimportant to me\" problem.\n\nNTA - are you going to remind him when to show up for your wedding and what does that say about you if you do?  People plan and remember the things that are important to them.", "NTA he's being immature", "NTA - he needs to grow up. I would stop reminding him about everything if I were you.", "NTA. He\u2019s being childish and irresponsible for making commitments and not sticking to them. It takes all of 2 minutes to add something to the calendar in his phone. Tell him you won\u2019t remind him anymore and he has to deal with the consequences of his own inability to manage his time and commitments.", "NTA but this clearly shows that you need to stop reminding him like now. No \"why didn't you remind me\" bull from him. He has made it clear he wants no reminders from you and he is an adult. You are not his mom. \n\nI remind my partner all the time about things. But he is always grateful and thanks me so I keep doing it.", "YTA but just because you're not his mom. Let him miss his commitment and \"stay out of his business\". \n\nAnd just for your sake don't do it anymore because it would become expected of you, That not a role you should have in a relationship with a functioning adult", "NTA\n\nAs someone with memory issues - it's 2022. He has a cell phone and can set up reminders. Don't marry someone who loses their shit because they are frustrated.", "NTA y t a to yourself for putting up with this manipulation, it\u2019s not going to improve after your married.", "Does he not know how to use the Reminders app on his phone? You describe someone with the maturity of a 12 year old boy. Do you really want to marry this person? NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
