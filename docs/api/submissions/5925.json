It cost $45 but I had a good week and my plan was to eat it throughout the day and once I was done share it with everyone else. I sat down to eat my lunch and a coworker came up and asked me if she (29f) could have a piece. I said no cause I just started to eat and I was hungry and I honestly just didn't want to share my food at this time. She asks why and I said because this is my food and it was 45 dollars and I didn't want to share. She then says \n\n\"are you seriously going to eat that whole thing?\" \n\nAnd my response is yeah probably throughout the whole day. \n\nAfter this she comes back in later and says \"I hope you're not feeling a certain way about me\" \n\nI said \"yeah I thought what you did was rude cause I was just trying to eat my lunch\"\n\nShe then goes on to explain to me how I was the one that was rude and I should have said no nicer and that she was really hungry and her food wasn't here yet and I should've been nicer. I told her I was done with the conversation and went to sit in the hallway and then I hear her call me a bitch to another coworker. \n\nSo AITA here? I literally just wanted to eat my food on my time and not share but if I am the ah I want to know.\n\n\nSmall update. \n\nShe actually reached out and apologized today. I cannot thank you all enough for your support and advice!

You're entitled to do it, but you're gonna piss people off because they see that meat and they want it in their mouth.", "Ugh it grinds my gears SO MUCH when people ask to try my food the second I get it. Like can I have 5 seconds to enjoy it myself first? Luckily, whenever I've said no for this reason I haven't been met with such bizarre resistance. Same thing goes for people who think just because you didn't eat all of your meal doesn't mean you aren't expecting to save it for a second meal, the entitlement/privilege is so apparent. \n\nDefinitely NTA, I agree with some here I'd consider reporting it unless you feel her apology was sincere.", "Although it\u2019s your charcuterie board and you have the right to do with it whatever you want, I would say it\u2019s more right for you to share it than not. Giving a small piece of cheese away doesn\u2019t really hurt you at all. Also consider this, what if this person forgot to bring their lunch? What if they were genuinely hungry and just wanted some food? Hoarding the entire charcuterie board for yourself doesn\u2019t seem right to me. \n\nBasically, if you have the opportunity to do something nice for someone you should do it, especially if it comes at little cost to you.", "NTA. Upvote for Shark Coochie Board.", "NTA. Who the fuck is that entitled to someone else's food?", "Who the fuck asks for a bite of food from someone unless they\u2019re super close friends or family? NTA, that person is nuts.", "Joey DOES NOT SHARE FOOD!", "NTA. People shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to others food. Also grow up, you got told no, she\u2019s a pouty child", "You couldn\u2019t sacrifice a fuckin\u2019 cracker to maintain office relationships?", "I can understand family being close enough to do this, but seeing so many stories of coworkers asking to share food is blowing my mind. One of my coworkers offered a bite of his food to me and it was shocking to me. It was very kind but like... I dunno, too familiar for a work setting?", "Ya it does sound like she bought a massive plate obviously made for multiple people. That kinda adds more context that makes things make sense.", "I agree. That sounds like a great meal but I think I'd order it to enjoy at home. It's the office equivalent of bringing in a box of donuts then eating them alone in a shared space.", "You forgot to answer my question.... Hmmm", "I\u2019m interested in starting a career in lunch policing. Do you enjoy the work? How does the benefits package compare with similar fields?", "> My assumption is that she told her spouse/family about it and they were like \"bruh you fucked up\"\n\nOr someone saw this post and that you were planning on reporting her. Be careful OP.\n\nNTA", "Wow!! I never would have guessed she's a manager. That's unprofessional AF.", "Well the idea is that if you can do something nice for someone then you probably should. Yes you don\u2019t have to share your pizza, but what is 1 less slice for a single person eating a party pizza?\n\nI don\u2019t have to hold the door open for someone. I don\u2019t need to let strangers borrow my phone for making a call to their families. I don\u2019t even need to give tips. \n\nBut not doing these things when I could, makes me a bitter closed off person, maybe even an asshole. \n\nThe fact that OP felt the need to even post this story on Reddit makes me think that she had some doubts about the morality of her decisions. If she genuinely believed she did nothing wrong then why even post on this sub?\n\nWith that being said coworker definitely didn\u2019t handle this situation well either", "That makes it worse.", "Hands off my order of all.the.things from Buc-cees.", "ONCE I have accidentally asked for a bite of my wife's food at a restaurant before she had the chance to try the main.\n\nWe both like to have a bite of our food first and then are open to sharing when out.\n\nI apologized and honestly thought she already had some. It wasn't obvious that she had not yet.\n\nNTA.", "same here!", "Yeah, even before the name-calling I was going to say NTA.\n\nI am also the kind of person who would proceed to stuff myself to the point of vomiting if necessary just so nobody else could have said food. \"IT'S MIIIIIIIIINE!!!\"", "And my Fitz's rootbeer.\n\nI was willing to give a very small piece of gooey butter cake to my SO, but the rootbeer only comes in a 4-pack.", "Unless previously planned, I bring food for myself\u2026no matter how much food it is. Even if it looks shareable, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026.because it\u2019s mine. \n\nAs mentioned before, entitlement in anyone is unappealing. Realize that you\u2019re not entitled to someone\u2019s food because they have a large amount of it. Lol. It\u2019s really not a difficult concept to grasp."]}
