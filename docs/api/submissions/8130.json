If you call out for basically no reason, they can and will fire you. That will be a bad impression and will give the idea that you\u2019re unreliable at work. Your wife has to understand that", "NTA. If you don't feel comfortable calling in to your new job, you should not - and I wouldn't either! \n\nDoes your wife often demand that you put her needs ahead of yours? I can't understand why she can't do this alone, or make other arrangements that don't risk your new job.", "NTA, you could be fired for calling off for no reason and you and your wife could have called a babysitter if it was that big of a deal", "NTA - does she seriously need you to hold her hand while she meets her friends?  Can't she manage the trip there alone?  These are her friends, not yours; why should she impose on you?", "Don't call in, OP. Your job is new, and you're still building a reputation for reliability. Surely the family income is more important than driving your wife to a social engagement! She should meet her friends during the weekend, or drive herself.", "NTA. Your commitment to your job is important, and more important than an optional trip so you wife can meet HER friends. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to manage your wife\u2019s anxiety. If you\u2019re able to take her you will, but you\u2019re not required to. She needs to figure out some other solution or go on her own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife is.", "Thats also what i had tried to explain to her but she doesnt think itll be a big deal. Just the idea of calling in gives me alot of anxiety and worry especially knowing im the new guy and they need me there.", "She doesnt often, but if she gets her mind set on something it can be hard to convince her otherwise. As far as not going alone, she has really bad anxiety and its hard for her to leave the house by herself so I get that she wants me to go but i cant justify risking my job for it", "It should give her anxiety too, potentially jeopardizing your job heading into a recession like that.", "That's not anxiety - that's called being a responsible adult. Is her schedule flexible or would she be screwing someone over by taking this day trip?", "You have said that calling in to work gives you anxiety.  She says leaving the house alone gives her anxiety.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem right to make you suffer anxiety so she can avoid it.\n\nNobody has to feel anxiety if she stays at home and you go to work.  She should plan the hangout for another time.\n\nNTA", "Anxiety is tough, but jeopardizing your income is not a good idea. Is there anyone else who could go with her, or a way to rearrange the trip?

I tried to figure out a different day that would work but her friends only work weekends apparently so it wouldnt work out that way. I tried to say we could do it in 2 weeks and i could ask off work but she wasnt having that either.", "Give her a xanax and put her on a shuttle bus.

Not using them means you are leaving money you are entitled to have on the table.\n\n>On top of that my job is currently short staffed due to a recent merger that left us with a pretty bare bones crew. \n\nUnless you are the owner, this is not your problem. Do not make it your problem unless your work hires you to be the manager.\n\n>So I told her I wouldnt be able to call in on such notice and this is something that I would need to plan ahead for and request a day off.\n\nThis is sensible, but remember that mental health is always a valid reason to use sick leave. Taking one of your days to recharge when you are burned out is good and will lead to you being more productive. It's a good thing to do from time to time.\n\n> It just makes me very uncomfortable to do so. \n\nThis is the only answer you need. \n\nNTA if you don't want to go. But rethink how your are viewing your entitled leave. The company is not your family, you cannot \"let it down\" by using the compensation you are entitled to. The worldview that perpetuates people not using their compensation comes from middle management wanting to extract as much as possible from each employee while keeping actual compensation below what is promised.", "NTA. One never wants to ask for a sudden vacation day just after starting a new job, assuming one even has the vacation time that quickly to begin with. Being the \"new guy\" and leaving your new coworkers in the lurch is also potentially a career limiting move. If wife wants a day trip, wife should plan ahead with everyone involved and either involve you in the planning or let you work.", "NTA. taking a day off because your wife wants a play date is ridiculous. I would never take or expect my husband to not go to work for a fun day. Particularly in a new job, it sends the wrong signal.", "Everybody suffers from anxiety these days,it's the new go to disorder. Covers all and anything. Gets used too much just to excuse people from doing things they'd prefer not to do. There's a big difference between getting stressed out and anxiety. Has she tried adulting?"]}
