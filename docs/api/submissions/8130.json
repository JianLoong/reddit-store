If you call out for basically no reason, they can and will fire you. That will be a bad impression and will give the idea that you\u2019re unreliable at work. Your wife has to understand that", "NTA. If you don't feel comfortable calling in to your new job, you should not - and I wouldn't either! \n\nDoes your wife often demand that you put her needs ahead of yours? I can't understand why she can't do this alone, or make other arrangements that don't risk your new job.", "NTA, you could be fired for calling off for no reason and you and your wife could have called a babysitter if it was that big of a deal", "NTA - does she seriously need you to hold her hand while she meets her friends?  Can't she manage the trip there alone?  These are her friends, not yours; why should she impose on you?", "Don't call in, OP. Your job is new, and you're still building a reputation for reliability. Surely the family income is more important than driving your wife to a social engagement! She should meet her friends during the weekend, or drive herself.", "NTA. Your commitment to your job is important, and more important than an optional trip so you wife can meet HER friends. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to manage your wife\u2019s anxiety. If you\u2019re able to take her you will, but you\u2019re not required to. She needs to figure out some other solution or go on her own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As far as I can tell, there's no reason why your wife can't go meet with her friends by herself.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\n\nWhy can't she go without you? \n\n\nIt's fair enough for her to ask I guess, but she should definitely take no for an answer.", "NTA. Your wife is.", "Thats also what i had tried to explain to her but she doesnt think itll be a big deal. Just the idea of calling in gives me alot of anxiety and worry especially knowing im the new guy and they need me there.", "She doesnt often, but if she gets her mind set on something it can be hard to convince her otherwise. As far as not going alone, she has really bad anxiety and its hard for her to leave the house by herself so I get that she wants me to go but i cant justify risking my job for it", "It should give her anxiety too, potentially jeopardizing your job heading into a recession like that.", "That's not anxiety - that's called being a responsible adult. Is her schedule flexible or would she be screwing someone over by taking this day trip?", "You have said that calling in to work gives you anxiety.  She says leaving the house alone gives her anxiety.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem right to make you suffer anxiety so she can avoid it.\n\nNobody has to feel anxiety if she stays at home and you go to work.  She should plan the hangout for another time.\n\nNTA", "Anxiety is tough, but jeopardizing your income is not a good idea. Is there anyone else who could go with her, or a way to rearrange the trip? Your suggestion that the friends come to your city was a good one.", "Sounds like she's putting her wants (visiting friends) over OPs needs (keeping the new job).\n\nNTA.", "If her anxiety is so bad she can't leave the house without you, the solution is not for you to skip work whenever she wants to do something. She needs to learn to manage her anxiety on her own. You're not responsible for managing her anxiety. \n\nYou're definitely NTA for having work ethics and putting your job first in this situation. \nIs your wife working and contributing financially?", "Unfortunately i dont think so, we live far away from most of our friends as we just moved recently. I tried to figure out a different day that would work but her friends only work weekends apparently so it wouldnt work out that way. I tried to say we could do it in 2 weeks and i could ask off work but she wasnt having that either.", "Give her a xanax and put her on a shuttle bus.  She's an adult and should learn to cope like one.\n\nOr the friend who's afraid to drive can take a bus up to see your SO.", "Why does she expect you to do it even if it gives you anxiety but she isn't expected to deal with her own anxiety and go see her friend alone? Double standards much\n\nNTA clearly", "NTA. Stand your ground, OP. Your wife sounds and is acting quite entitled.", "NTA rule one partners should never sabotage their partner's jobs for their own insecurity,  jealousy, or selfish wants.", "As someone who has accepted drugs on a Greyhound before, putting someone on a sedative before getting on a bus is a VERY bad idea. Worst 12 hours of my life."]}
