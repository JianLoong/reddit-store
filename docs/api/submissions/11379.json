My partner had to work so my MIL and I made plans for just the 2 of us. \n\nWhile on my way she rang me to let me know a friend of hers would be joining us for dinner. No problem. \n\nWhen I get there I see her with a man I had met a few times in my partners home town. I greeted them and we started dinner. It became obvious during dinner that they were more than friends. Also not a problem, MIL has been single my partners whole life. \n\nDinner was great, and as we were leaving MIL pulls me aside and asks me to keep her friend\u2019s presence at dinner hushed so she could tell my partner about her relationship herself. I nodded and hugged her. \n\nThen I hugged him goodbye. He did something weird. He very wet kissed my ear. I was shocked, but i kept my composure and got in my uber. \n\nWhen I got home my partner asked me about dinner. I had to lie which I hated, but I also want to respect MIL. However she had been here for a week and didn\u2019t say a word about this man until I was driving to dinner. She left early this morning and we have no plans to see her anytime soon. I want to be honest with my partner and I have no clue as to when she plans to tell her kids. On top of that I want my partner to be aware of his behavior as I know my partner would have concerns about this man being around the teenagers that still live at home. \n\nWIBTA if I broke my promise to MIL and told my partner the truth about dinner?\n\nEdit- Mil\u2019s friend seems to have acquired my phone number. I\u2019m going to tell my partner as soon as I can.\n\nUpdateish- I told my partner that MIL brought friend to dinner without letting it slip that they are more then friends. (Friend apparently has property in our city so it wasn\u2019t weird to my partner) I told him about the wet ear, he didn\u2019t love that detail but he said we\u2019d talk more about it later. I feel better knowing that he knows at least a slice of it and I think from here it will be easier for MIL to introduce the topic with my partner.

He may not have wiped his mouth.  \n\nI just don't understand how people have never had a wet kiss from someone that wasn't sexual.", "People are weird and they're...human.  Sometimes embarrassment prevents people from saying things.\n\nSome first dates, some first time meeting them from acquaintances, some first time meeting period.  Had a vendor for my company do it once after we had lunch together and had a great conversation that had nothing to do with work.  She did immediately apologize and I didn't take offense, because the conversation we had was great and it was like an instant friendship that felt like a long one.  Some have apologized, others have stuttered out apologies, some have laughed, some didn't apologize.  For the ones that didn't, if there were no other signs, I assumed that they either didn't realize it was awkward or they did, but were embarrassed.\n\nNot everything is black and white and there's definitely not enough information from the OP's post for anyone to sit here an claim sexual assault.  That's a serious accusation rightfully so and deserves the respect it's due before accusing anyone of it.\n\nEdit* spelling", "Or he awkwardly messed up a simple cheek kiss and thought addressing it would add to the awkward.", "Even if it isn't sexual it's revolting and would make me incredibly uncomfortable.", "Uncomfortable is fine.  Assuming it was some type of sexual assault is another story entirely and needs to be treated seriously before accusing or throwing the words around.  If there were other indicators, by all means let someone know immediately.  If not and it was just an awkward mistake...then to start accusing someone of SA, that's not a joke.", "This whole thing is pretty weird and I\u2019d be concerned too. If she wanted some time with him she could have easily snuck away during the week. She purposefully chose to bring him when only you were around. Was she acting weirdly? Were you there because he saw a photo of you and she wanted to please him? So many creepy questions. I hope his sisters are safe. \n\nJust some advice. If someone asks you to keep a secret from your bf say no. If they want to tell him themselves, give them a max of three days or you will tell. Never keep secrets from your partner when it affects them. Your loyalty is with them. This of course does not apply to secrets of a very personal nature told in confidence. NTA", "I think you\u2019re exactly right. You told your partner *exactly* the relevant part while keeping your promise. \n I think you should give MIL a chance to tell your partner first if you\u2019re planning to do that. Either way though,NTA.", "ESH\n\nYou should never have agreed to promise or at least put a time limit on it.  You have a week to tell him yadda yadda.  But since she was expecting you to lie to him that night and forgoing nights--you shouldn't have made promise.  \n\nIf you had gone somewhere and \"seen\" them while there(not interacted), then it might have been a reasonable ask on your MIL's part.  But the moment she made him a part of your life actions(that your husband might/did enquire about) and therefore requiring you to lie, not just not disclose--your MIL became an A-H.\n\nNext time, don't promise.  Next time, don't lie.\n\nOh and his guy is an A-H for wet ear kissing(EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW)", "NAH.\n\nYou should immediately tell your MIL about the \"ear\", and that because of that you slipped up and just told your husband that a random friend had joined.  Stress that your husband has no idea your MIL is more than friends, but that he did uncomfortably touch you in a gross and improper way and you had no one to confide in but him.  You did nothing wrong, but your MIL is going to hate you and I think this is the narrative that will make her hate you the least.", "NTA. Your lying to your partner about his mother. That\u2019s not ok. She shouldn\u2019t have asked you to lie but you\u2019re the one that\u2019s lying. How would you feel if it was the other way round?", "Perhaps after speaking to partner and MIL, someone should talk to the 3 minor girls, too! Seems as they are most vulnerable, they should be clued in. And you should get to the bottom of how he got your phone #, too, because it's really not on for anyone to give your number out w/o checking in with you.\n*edited for typos", "My MIL is not your classic Reddit JNoMIL. She will never hate me and to be completely honest I\u2019m not worried about this effecting our relationship more than I\u2019m worried about it screwing with her relationship with her children. She is a damn good mom. I\u2019ll ring her in a few hours and let her know where we are at.", "Sounds like a plan. She deserves to know about her friend's inappropriate behavior ASAP.", "I think region is really important here. In the Us, in the midwest and east, that would absolutely be huge boundary stomping behavior that is unacceptable for someone you just met. A man you\u2019ve never met before? No no no.", "Why was it slobbery then? I\u2019ve never had an open mouth check kiss it\u2019s more of a peck.", "Why was it slobbery then? I\u2019ve never had an open mouth check kiss it\u2019s more of a peck.", "They have met before", "They were having lunch.  There was likely liquid sustenance.  It's not beyond the realm of possibility that he drank something, didn't wipe his lips and they were wet.  After dinner mint.  Licked hips lips nervously etc.  It's far more likely his lips were wet from the 101 other reasons than because hes some kind of sexual predator, especially since the OP didn't mention anything else cringe worthy about him.", "Who knows... that\u2019s what a conversation with her MIL will solve. There\u2019s no indication from anything OP has stated that MIL would put her children in harms way. No one even knows what their relationship is. For all anyone knows this guy lives no where near OP\u2019s MIL! At least give MIL a tiny bit of respect & ask some questions before the jury convicts this man on SA.", "NTA!!\n\nAnd that edit in your post about that creepy friend getting your number\u2026. Yikes!! \n\nI\u2019d bet money this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s pulled that shit in front of her. I also find it strange that she gave you such short notice. Like, she either planned to spring it on you, or she invited a person you barely know to come with her at the last minute. Either way, she\u2019s the AH. And why even involve you in meeting him before she told your husband?? Asking you to keep her secret (aka lie about who you had dinner with) was shitty too. \n\nHow did you find out he got your number? Please tell me he didn\u2019t text you the \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc42emojis!! (Sorry thought you might need a laugh at this point.) Have you asked MiL yet if she gave it to him? (Versus him finding it online somehow or something.) \n\nI know I\u2019m just some Reddit rando\u2026\nbut I\u2019m still worried about you. Anyone who will lick someone\u2019s ear without consent, not to mention their girlfriend\u2019s daughter-in-law\u2019s, and then end up getting hold of that person\u2019s number (again without consent) is bad news. Please continue to keep us updated!! I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. \ud83e\ude77", "I have a feeling MIL gave my number. That wouldn\u2019t usually be an issue and to the best of her knowledge we ended on a good note after dinner. Fortunately he just let me know it was him and made a comment regarding a conversation the three of us had at dinner. Not creepy thank goodness! I\u2019m not sure MILs intentions behind telling me last minute but honestly I\u2019m sure it was due to nerves about my Husband finding out. I\u2019ll update as I can but I\u2019m hoping it will be so boring that i won\u2019t need to!", "I\u2019m wiping my ear just reading about it. Ewww", "NTA.\n\nI realize there can be extenuating times that call for it, but I am dead against having to keep secrets from one's committed partner. MIL should know better. You were gracious to give her a chance to talk to her son.\n\nWhere this went south was when you were given unwanted (and disgusting) attention from her date. You did fine, and I understand why you're concerned about young women still at home. I don't get, however, why you are concerned about making your MIL to have an easier time.\n\nI am a different person, but I would have called her as soon as you knew she was free, informed her of her date's behavior, and told her she had exactly 1 hour to square this with her son, because at 1 hour and 1 minute, you would be having a conversation with him.\n\nThere is no happy way for this to go. You will always be the person who brought her bad choice to light. I'm sorry that this will cause friction. Really, though, don't you think she deserves to know?", "If you witness your boyfriend's introduction to Mr. Tonguey, please, please update. I wonder how long he will be MIL's special friend. NAH.", "Same"]}
