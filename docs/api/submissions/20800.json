She freaks out because there's no way a camera can be that expensive according to her, which I say yes, it is, and camera prices can go all the way up to the moon. The argument escalated a lot, she said would sue me for not giving her the wedding photos, so I took the SD card out of the camera and threatened her to dump it into a whiskey glass if she didn't pay me for my camera.

Do you only bring one camera and one lens to on-location shoots?\n\nThe kid was out of control, but a wedding is an environment where drunk people are spilling stuff, bumping into stuff, etc. Your equipment is always at elevated risk at such events. Insurance is prudent and can be built into the cost of your wedding packages. Instead you burned bridges by making a scene and dealing with both child and bride very hostilely. There were so many potential customers there who will instead spread the word that you are a wedding ruiner. If you'd had insurance, you could have stayed calm in the moment and discretely dealt with requesting the deductible from her later. If you'd brought along backup equipment, you wouldn't have missed the rest of the event's photos. Terrible behavior by the child and parent, but professionalism and preparedness would be your responsibility. What if you'd accidentally damaged the camera, or it failed? You'd be in a jam without backup equipment at the ready.

The situation you're in is so frustrating, and the bride and groom should certainly reimburse you for a new camera. You're completely entitled to withhold their pictures until they do so.\n\nThat being said, it's never okay to yell at someone else's kid. The childhood memories I have of being yelled at are not about my parents, but other adults because it makes you feel *like shit*. The poor boy was probably acting out for attention because of his mother's remarriage, which doesn't make his behavior okay, but does seem to indicate some bad parenting choices by the bride. He was probably already having a really hard day, and by yelling at him you made the situation so much worse.", "N T A for expecting the bride to replace your camera. Totally reasonable. \n\nBut your behaviour at the wedding was totally unacceptable. You caused an absolute SCENE. I get it, you're upset - but you could have handled this in a much calmer way. Swearing at a child and calling them stupid? Then shouting for the bride? You clearly knew about the small claims process, so I'm not sure why you felt the need to keep yelling and threatening the bride's photos. You did not act like a professional in this situation, so for that reason, I'm saying YTA.", "ESH, you probably didn't need to yell but the bride absolutely should not have argued with you about how much your camera cost after her kid deliberately, willfully destroyed it, and if this story is even real, the fact that she allowed her kid to run around wildly when he's the kind of child who would grab someone's property and destroy it intentionally was very bad parenting.", "YTA - Look, I get it. It sucks when someone destroys your property, especially something as expensive as a camera. But here's the thing, you were at a wedding, a joyful occasion, and you lost your cool with a child. Shouting at him and using profanity was completely uncalled for. I understand your frustration, but you should have handled it in a more composed and professional manner.\n\nThreatening to destroy the SD card was also way out of line. Holding someone's wedding photos hostage is a terrible move, no matter how upset you are. It's understandable that the bride and her husband are furious with you. They hired you to capture their special day, and instead, you caused a scene and ruined the atmosphere.\n\nWhile it's true that the child shouldn't have touched your camera without permission, kids can be curious and impulsive. As an adult and a professional, you should have known better than to lose control and yell at a child. Instead, you should have spoken calmly to the bride and explained the situation, seeking a resolution without causing a spectacle.\n\nFiling a lawsuit might be your right, but it won't do you any favors in the court of public opinion. People are reacting negatively because they see your actions as extreme and disproportionate. In the future, try to handle conflicts with more maturity and professionalism, especially when children are involved.", "YTA.  My judgment would be completely the opposite if you had made any effort to act like a professional instead of completely losing your shit and disrupting the wedding.  But if you had acted like a professional, you also might have gotten a different response from the bride and groom.", "Yta. \n\n You are the adult. You should have acted like one. You don't yell and swear at a child like that.  \n\nBut yes. The parents have to pay for the camera.", "ESH, but YTA for your behavior.  This is a terrible situation, but you massively disrupted their day and were unprofessional.  For weddings you should have business insurance which will cover gear, as well as a backup camera.", "YTA - you should have handled the child differently (eg not call him stupid), and definitely not destroyed the wedding over this.

You\u2019re right to fight for getting your money for your camera but you chose to go about it in an asshole-ish way.

I don't subscribe to this \"how dare you discipline my baby, you beast!\", attitude.

Then, when the parent is confronted, instead of pulling aside the photographer and her son to figure out what happened she seems to dismiss it.  \n\nBad parenting isn't the word.  Mom is very much T.A. - This kid must have free reign to think he would get away with something like this.

Sue for stress as well.", "Oh please just cause he's a kid he should get a pass? You obviously have never had an expensive piece of equipment ruined by a child with no supervision and no home training. In the moment you are not thinking about his age.

Not to mention you would probably have to buy new lenses too.", "I mean DSLRs are professional cameras. Admittedly not all DSLRs have the specs required and some professionals may choose to still use film or even medium format but for wedding photography the vast majority would be using at least one DSLR.

That doesn\u2019t feel normal. I\u2019ve been around my fair share of kids and while breaking stuff is fairly common (snapping rulers and pencils, breaking the arms off of dolls, chewing things, etc.) it mainly comes from them testing their own strengths and the limitations of the items around them, but it\u2019s not usually that aggressive", "My kid just turned five, and she's known for a while that throwing things (especially electronics) on the ground and/or stomping on them will break them, and that breaking things (especially things that are not yours) is bad.

I'm at best an amateur photographer, and my camera kit retailed for closer to $2,000.  At the time, it was walking the bleeding edge between top of the line consumer camera and entry level pro body.  Hell, the telephoto lens I want to buy costs over a grand.\n\nBride is probably one of those that think her friend with an iPhone can take \"really good pictures\", and doesn't have the slightest idea what true photography equipment can cost.\n\nNTA, and OP, if you have any kind of photography business, when you sue them, include lost revenue from jobs you are unable to do while you replace the camera body.", "Forreal.

But when you know that the damage will be covered regardless of whether or not the bride pays for it, you can keep your cool, stay working, and maintain the professional relationship long enough to politely discuss after the wedding that the price for finished photos will include the cost of deliberate damage by the child.

I can see where you fall with customer service.", "Agreed. The kid knew what he was doing was wrong. Honestly it could have ended worse.", "Without any type of argument is ironic when the op is being confrontational with everyone,  to the point guests leave. \n\nWe all agree the camera should be covered and the kid was a terror.

You take the vandal's information and you deal with it calmly while in public because you are visibly representing the company brand and would be fired if you take the company viral for being that company with the crazy mean asshole who hates on little old ladies.
