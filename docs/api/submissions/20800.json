I bought the camera 2nd hand from one of my friends who is also a photographer, I've worked with hi as an assistant for a while. The brand new price of that camera would be around 1200 dollars.\n2.

Insurance is prudent and can be built into the cost of your wedding packages. Instead you burned bridges by making a scene and dealing with both child and bride very hostilely. There were so many potential customers there who will instead spread the word that you are a wedding ruiner. If you'd had insurance, you could have stayed calm in the moment and discretely dealt with requesting the deductible from her later. If you'd brought along backup equipment, you wouldn't have missed the rest of the event's photos. Terrible behavior by the child and parent, but professionalism and preparedness would be your responsibility. What if you'd accidentally damaged the camera, or it failed?

You did not act like a professional in this situation, so for that reason, I'm saying YTA.", "ESH, you probably didn't need to yell but the bride absolutely should not have argued with you about how much your camera cost after her kid deliberately, willfully destroyed it, and if this story is even real, the fact that she allowed her kid to run around wildly when he's the kind of child who would grab someone's property and destroy it intentionally was very bad parenting.", "YTA - Look, I get it. It sucks when someone destroys your property, especially something as expensive as a camera. But here's the thing, you were at a wedding, a joyful occasion, and you lost your cool with a child. Shouting at him and using profanity was completely uncalled for. I understand your frustration, but you should have handled it in a more composed and professional manner.\n\nThreatening to destroy the SD card was also way out of line. Holding someone's wedding photos hostage is a terrible move, no matter how upset you are. It's understandable that the bride and her husband are furious with you. They hired you to capture their special day, and instead, you caused a scene and ruined the atmosphere.\n\nWhile it's true that the child shouldn't have touched your camera without permission, kids can be curious and impulsive. As an adult and a professional, you should have known better than to lose control and yell at a child. Instead, you should have spoken calmly to the bride and explained the situation, seeking a resolution without causing a spectacle.\n\nFiling a lawsuit might be your right, but it won't do you any favors in the court of public opinion.

Children should generally be accountable for their actions once old enough to understand cause and effect, but consider that this child's been through divorce and presumably feels ways about things about the new partner, and might have been upset by the wedding (not being the center of attention, having a new parent, overtired, overstimulated, etc.).

The bride and groom were already going to miss out on the rest of the photos they'd hoped you would take, so they had a loss here too.\n\nAssuming you didn't insure your equipment, since the loss was directly associated with her child's bad behavior,  the bride and groom should compensate you - however, if they don't, you should consider whether legal action is worth the time and effort.  \n\nThrowing tantrums, making a scene, and suing clients affects *your* reputation also. Loss of potential work as a result of bad word of mouth is probably going to cost you more to replace than the camera.  Maybe this is not the right line of work for you.\n\nEdited to add- I'm honestly shocked by how many ppl here say NTA. Oof.", "ESH - Yes, the kid was an asshole, but you're a professional, at work. Swearing automatically makes you the asshole too. I'm presuming you're not a high-end photographer as $700 as a camera body isn't that much.. plus you should probably have a spare body on a job anyway. You should also have insurance that would cover you for things like this; and possibly terms and conditions that cover situations like this.\n\nIt's what SOME kids do. Because some kids are assholes. Her kid, her responsibility. Just don't shout and swear in response to events like this - or threaten to destroy photos. Be a pro.\n\nApologise about how you reacted - explain how your camera is a tool you need to earn a living and by destroying it has cost you time and money. You understand children can act like this, but when they do, it is the responsibility of the parent to make amends for their actions - it's not up to the damaged party to foot the bill. Ask for all comments on social media to be deleted and you'll provide them with a few of the key photos of the event, but you must be compensated for the camera (and really.. if it wasn't new, it shouldn't be the full price - you can always replace it with a second-hand one). You yelled at their kid on their wedding day - knock 10% off your original price (since it's the only way you'll get more money) and if they pay that plus the camera body, you'll deliver all the photos.\n\nIt's crap, but it's probably a danger of the job. Now get insurance.", "YTA because no matter how shitty the situation, that was completely unprofessional. Yes you can try to get your camera back from the kid but you don't yell and curse at the kid and confront the bride (?!?) in the middle of the reception and threaten to put the SD card in whiskey. That is ridiculously unprofessional.\n\nTypically if you are a pro wedding photographer you have a backup camera body.

But anyone would be hard pressed to find any fault with you and the event wouldn't have been interrupted.\n\n Yelling and threatening the bride, taking the whole event atmosphere down was too much in my opinion.

At that point, if you bill them and they don\u2019t comply, you take them to court.\n\nThe answers here are gonna skew NTA because Reddit generally hates kids.

But the bride is right about one thing\u2014 it was unprofessional. Something expensive of yours that you care about deeply was broken by the child of your client. The bride should have had her son under supervision and prevented that. But the situation can be solved outside of the wedding day. You got into a huge argument with your client in front of her guests, and then you threatened her by holding the SD card over a whiskey glass. You could have at least taken the argument to a private spot where the guests wouldn\u2019t have seen it. Imagine if this was some other kind of event, like a runway with models. Your client\u2019s child breaks your camera this time, too. You call them over, interrupting the models who are displaying of all the outfits, interrupting the people who were hired to work the lights, interrupting everyone, start arguing in front of the audience for all to see, and then threaten to stop the SD card under your foot. A wedding is an important event, and you were hired to attend. They didn\u2019t respect your time or your equipment, but there was an audience full of people there. And you let the drama continue to play out into a full blown shouting match it sounds like. The money could have been settled later, you could even have still withheld the photos on the SD card if they didn\u2019t want to pay, just after the fact. The proper response I think in this situation would have been to tell the bride you were leaving as your expensive equipment was damaged and will contact them later for reimbursement.

If they refused of flew off the handle then, I would agree they are to blame. However, this whole scenario started at an already escalated place.", "Ah yes he should have sucked it up and hoped to get the BRIDE or GROOMS private attention on their WEDDING day so he could demand payment for something the bride believes costs a fraction of what he's asking ?

I get him being curious or accidentally dropping it but to spike and stomp it into the ground when told to give it back is a behaviour only learnt when parents refuse to parent or have the exact same personality type themselves . Them trying to destroy his reputation rather than admit any wrongdoing on their part speaks volumes to where the kid learnt that behaviour in the first place .", "Yes this above. Plus if you are going to be charging for your photography services, you need insurance for your equipment or keep it in your business plan that you may have to replace for breakage or loss.
