During thanksgiving this year they made a huge deal about seeing my newborn son who was six weeks old at the time. I mentioned that I wasn\u2019t comfortable having my son in a house with 20+ people who aren\u2019t wearing masks. I recommended that I could come by and my son could stop by for a quick outdoor visit then I would stay for dinner by myself. This was the plan up until three days before thanksgiving when my brother told me his two year old daughter has RSV and that him and his partner had both become sick as well, the intended on staying home for thanksgiving. This is where the piss off comes in, my mother goes behind my back and begs my brother to come anyways even though they\u2019re sick because she \u201cjust can\u2019t bare to not see her grandkid on thanksgiving\u201d. My brother gave in and ended up going, this made me completely uncomfortable with being there as I didn\u2019t want to catch RSV and bring it home to my baby. My family made a huge deal about me skipping thanksgiving and spent the whole meal talking about how we\u2019re over sheltering our son and complaining about my partner and I (we were told this by my brother and his partner). I blew up and got in a huge fight with my parents, explaining how this made me feel like I was not wanted around and all they care about is saving face to look like \u201cthe good grandparents\u201d. They promised things would be different and they would listen to our rules going forward so I decided to let it go in favour of not ruining the relationship as long as they followed our riles. The last few weeks they have had little to no contact with us but when they do it seems as though they are being respectful. That is until today, my birthday. My parents asked if I wanted to stop by to see my family for my birthday and have dinner. I told them I would be fine with that as long as everyone masks until dinner time where we will put our som in a separate room for a nap while we eat. This apparently isn\u2019t okay and my siblings have issue with making their 7-10 year old kids wear masks for a few hours, so instead they are going to have a get together on my birthday weekend without me so they don\u2019t have to wear masks. My grandmother also visited yesterday and waited until ten minutes into holding him to tell us she was getting over a cold, I snatched him up and told asked her to leave, she was well aware of the rules and decided to shirk them.\n\nTL/DR: parents chose to see their granddaughter who had RSV instead of their newborn grandson then complained about not seeing him for weeks. They now refuse to wear masks for my birthday visit so are going to have a get together without me.\n\nAITA for cutting off my family completely?
