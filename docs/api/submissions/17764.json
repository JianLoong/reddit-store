We had asked everyone at a family supper weeks before and everyone agreed to it. As the date approached we had also reminded everyone a few times\n\nNTA. Since your sister-in-law explicitly agreed to the plan of joining you at the cabin on Saturday, it's reasonable to expect that she would respect your request to have the cabin to yourselves on your anniversary night. You made the arrangements well in advance and even reminded everyone multiple times. Her decision to show up on your special night without prior agreement is disrespectful and inconsiderate.
