After saving for years my gf and I were finally able to take him to Disney. Really been looking forward to this trip, all of us. One of the main co parenting issues my ex and I have is how much she spoils him. He is not used to hearing the word no and has gotten much worse over the last couple years. Full blown toddler tantrums at times. He was already starting to pout bc of the long lines but when we finally got up very close to getting on the ride my gf started to feel very bad. She\u2019s diabetic and obviously her sugar had dropped, we needed to get food in her immediately. She insisted I stay and ride with him while she went to find food but I have literally seen her pass out before so I couldn\u2019t do that. Told my son I\u2019m sorry we will come back but we have to get her food or she will get very sick. First it was crying, then it was crying and screaming. Ppl are looking, gf looks embarrassed, then he throws himself on the ground refusing to get up until we ride RIGHT NOW he kept screaming. Eventually I picked him up like a plank of wood and we walked off him kicking and screaming the entire time. We got her food, she felt better, he immediately started saying let\u2019s go let\u2019s go. I was fuming and maybe I was the AH here. I told him after that bs he just pulled I didn\u2019t think he deserved to ride anything else until he apologized to me and gf for his behavior. He told me he would tell mom\u2026..I told him I couldn\u2019t possibly give less of a crap. Back to the hotel we went. He\u2019s not speaking to me, his mother says I\u2019m a total ass and my gf just feels like it\u2019s her fault and maybe we should have let him ride more. AITA?\n\nEdited to add: we brought snacks like plenty for her and him. He went overboard with eating then bc yes he\u2019s a kid and bored. I told her many times not to run out bc he\u2019s just bored and she said she had enough. After this ride it was time to reup on snacks and such anyways but the wait ended up being much longer and she realized she had in fact given him the last one, she was certain she had another. She did it bc one she loves him and and two she didn\u2019t want to escalate further as he was getting worse and worse. I was trying to not let him get away with the nonsense as I always do but def more lenient bc it\u2019s Disney!! The tantrum was it for me however. Just thought I\u2019d clarify and thank all of you so much for the constructive comments!!", "created_utc": 1677885995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hiljv/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_ride_more_rides/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have had a kid for 10 years and should have known to bring snacks. Your kid is 10 should know better than to throw themselves on the ground.  \nAt the end of the day your kid will never forget that you took him to Disney but didn\u2019t let him go on any rides because of your girlfriend.", "YTA.  Yes, your son's behavior sucked and obviously his mom has made him this way.  But you absolutely set your child up for failure!  This was first off not surprise behavior.  You knew how he was and what did you do?  Took him to a high-adrenaline, materialistic place with long lines, heat and frustration (keep in mind that I love Disney, but come on!).  Then you took him on rides without being prepared.  He should not have been getting your girlfriends snacks, you know the ones packed with sugar for her diabetes, it was bad for him and bad for her (as proven).  If you wanted him distracted there are actual games that could be played, like Disney heads up, or fidget stuff, or any other thing he enjoys while waiting for an hour for a much anticipated ride.  Instead,  just as the ride came into view after waiting and waiting, you pull him away?  Maybe a 10yr old shouldn't throw a temper tantrum but I am pretty sure that anyone would be pissed off in those circumstances.  You guys screwed up and are punishing him for reacting in a completely predictable manner.  Yes, he should apologize, but so should you!  Be a parent, not a Disney dad!", "ESH. \n\nNo one was at their best -  hot sun and long lines and big $$. \n\nSeems like y'all ought to have taken a break earlier for food & as a diabetic the gf should be carrying an emergency snack on her. \n\nFull-on tantrum at 10yo could be a neurodiverse child. You say he's spoiled and never told no, but after a long day in lines at Disney probably isn't the best time to force it either. Easy for that environment to lead to any kid being overtired, hangry, overstimulated.\n\nKid's behavior was absolutely not appropriate.\n\nEdit - didn't read the end, that kid was given opportunity to apologize and refused. You'll be remembered as ruining the trip, but I'd say NTA or ESH.", "YTA based on giving away the safety snacks in the line. Why did you decide to enforce boundaries seriously on a dream trip. Parenting needs to be in the trenches every time you\u2019re with him. Then you get to relax it for big trips and holidays. If you\u2019ve let it slide before, you really screwed yourself over.", "Honest question, are you fine with your son not talking to you again at all? \nJust a yes or no response will suffice", "NTA. 10 is WAY too old to be acting out like that - he needs to learn consequences. Giving him what he wants after that is the last thing you should you do.\n\nAs a sidenote though... couldn't you have gone to get food while your gf stayed in line with your son? Or brought some food with you? Seems like poor planning.", "What?? 10 years old and throwing tantrums? No way, you are NTA! You know you have a real problem on your hands, and you need to seriously address it, for the betterment of all concerned.", "Not only are you NTA, but you are a good parent. Kids need consequences, not free reign to act horribly.", "ESH. your son's tantrums are obviously an issue, and you handked it as well as could be expected, but you made the wrong call pulling him out of the line which caused the tantrum to begin with. Responsible adults prep for Disneyland with anything they might need to manage their conditions and I find it hard to believe that if her symptoms are that severe, you don't both travel well prepared! Long hours, hot sun, short temper, and the trip of a lifetime. He waits and waits and when it's finally time, you pull him away? After she says she's fine to wait? You were cruel to your son.", "NTA\n\nYou can't give into temper tantrums. Your son needs to understand that no = no.\n\nHe will grow up to be a spoiled brat", "ESH. The adults shit the bed hard on this one, and the kid is a brat.", "YTA for not being the one (as the parent) to put your foot down on the snack situation. That wasn\u2019t your girlfriend\u2019s responsibility to parent your child. If you\u2019d told him no on the snacks, then this whole situation doesn\u2019t happen.", "NTA - A tantrum is never acceptable behavior and kids need to be taught this. Entitled people become entitled because they were allowed behavior like this as a child.", "NTA.  Your son sounds pretty spoiled by his mom, unless he's on the spectrum he should not be acting in such a manner. \n\nAs far as his mom's thoughts, she's created this perfect storm of behavior.\n\nIf he's on the spectrum he still should not be acting like that, but it would explain why at 10 he's acting as a toddler.  \n\nMy son is on the spectrum and even he is better behaved.", "Yeah, idk with the description of how long it took you to save and your distaste of his mother/the attitude towards his behaviors in general, I can't help but feel like you probably built this up like a dream trip. \n\nSo,  you take a very excited ten year old to a \"magical\" place and (I'm sure) treat the \"dream\" trip with all the excitement of such, and after he's patient waiting in what even an adult considers a long line, you tell him he has to get out of that line for a women he doesn't know super well with an illness/sickness he likely can't understand who is ACTIVELY saying you guys should stay in line.\n\nHonestly, his reaction doesn't seem that developmentally inappropriate to the situation, maybe a year or two younger, but not toddler. \n\nThen, on top of this, you take him home from his dream trip, because you can't forgive a child for his behavior under stress in a situation that is over.\n\nYTA. You're also likely the reason he can't develop emotional regulation correctly, not his mother, as your tantrum was not developmentally appropriate.", "I have a rule.  I don't reward bad behavior.  \n\nNTA", ">I told him I couldn\u2019t possibly give less of a crap\n\nWas the wrong thing to say, as the parent you should have explained why his behavior was unacceptable.\n\nI guess NTA, but barely", "A bit of a jerk. He's still a kid", "That was not the time to play parent.", "NTA. Medical conditions always trump everything else.", "NTA.\n\nTen is old enough to know better, period.  Even if you make the argument that he was truly distraught and lost control, you gave him the opportunity to apologize for his behavior and continue, and he doubled down, plus threatening to tell mom shows that he is deliberately manipulating and trying to play you against each other.", "NTA\n\nYour 10 year old son prioritized riding some stupid ride that would maybe last 2 minutes if he was lucky over the well-being, and potentially life, of his Dad's girlfriend. That is incredibly selfish and you did the right thing.", "NTA at all. Given the time, effort and money that goes into planning a Disney trip, high five for following through and teaching responsibility even at your own detriment. I hope the happiest place on earth knocks some growth into him and entitlement out\u2728", "NTA. You have to show him that bad behavior has consequences. You did just fine.", "NTA. He\u2019s **10** and behaving like that?! Make sure your girlfriend knows she did nothing wrong and find a way to deal with your son before his Only I Matter mentality becomes a permanent part of his personality. You may want to seek professional help.", "NTA\n\nNo rides for you today kiddo. Behavior & actions have consequences. Your job is to teach son these lessons. Never fun for anyone when kids want to learn lessons the hard way but they gotta learn them!", "NTA\n\nIt was most certainly a bad idea to let him have most of her safety snacks, but that\u2019s less of an AH move than your son\u2019s behavior. He\u2019s 10, he\u2019s at the age where he should know how to properly handle no.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t agree with other commenters saying this wasn\u2019t the place to put your foot down. It was a perfectly valid scenario to show that actions have consequences, and your son needs to understand that. Allowing him to continue riding, simply shows that as long as he is willingly to throw a tantrum and tattle to mom, he will get his way.", "NTA.  10 years old?   It's long past time that kid has seen some punishment!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just an FYI. If you\u2019re at Disney with any type of disability look into getting that person the DAS pass. Everyone in the party can get linked to it .She could schedule rides for a particular time and you enter through the FastPass entrance or handicap entrance depending on the ride . Saved me last year", "NTA, Being a psychologist and working with children for over 13 years I've seen a lot of pretty bad cases. Him being 10 years old and acting in that manor is out of the norm.

At 10 years old your child should have grown past that stage.", "Read the edit", "Thanks for your opinion. For clarity she does bring snacks\u2026.but she had given them to my son bc he wanted them and had ran out.

I guess I\u2019m just not also okay with him continuing this behavior. There so so many incidents I could list but won\u2019t. I just want him to grow up with respect and awareness I guess.

But he knows my gf well for years. He has seen how her condition can affect her. Also of course we were all excited! We talked about the rides we would go on and cool stuff we would see.

Why would a diabetic give away what they need to live?", "That means you let it slide everytime and have never taught/enforced boundaries. They should be fulltime, regardless of a \"dreamtrip\".

You don't make someone wait in a Disney world line then leave right at the end and justify it with \" well we can just get back in line  later\". Cmon, you know that was unreasonable and terrible to ask of anyone, especially a child. \nIf you two were both adults, you know he'd cut off contact with you over this. I understand he's your kid, but him literally never speaking to you again is an unironic natural consequence of choosing your girlfriends comfort over his dream vacation. And you can rationalize it however but that's what happened to your kid. \nYou wanted to show him actions have consequences and that's great\nYou have to follow through now and leave him alone, because your actions also have consequences \nWhat kind of message does it send if you get to behave however without consequences but he doesn't? All it teaches him is to abuse and control those he can \nHe may have overreacted a bit, but let me make it clear you were the asshole. If you were friends you'd be the asshole. If you two were coworkers you'd be the asshole. And honestly? You're even more of an asshole because you're the parent, you need to lead by example and you failed to do that here man. \nHe should probably just stay with his mother for awhile, and if he EVER wants to come back, honestly you owe the kid an apology for ruining Disney world for some cooze.", "My husband is a Type 1 diabetic and when his sugar tanks, it's not a good scene, so I understand your worry.\n\nThat said, it's up to her to manage her illness, to have the proper snacks and/or glucose tablets to keep her sugar level on a daily, hourly basis. Giving her snacks away to pacify your badly behaved kid is doing you all a disservice.

Most parenting guides for disney say to expect your kid to regress while there developmentally. Out of a stroller? Expect to need one. Potty trained? Probably not right now. It\u2019s a very well known event. I think you went overboard on the taking the kid out of the park and not returning, that\u2019s quite a lot. Also, there\u2019s a system in place where you can get a ticket at the front of the park for someone with a disability to not need to wait directly in line, you can bring it to the attendant and get a return time written down, so your other half doesn\u2019t need to be away from food and drink while in line.", "Seems you\u2019ve let it go on for a long while and decided to put your foot down at a high stakes foolish moment.\n\nThere\u2019s a term \u2018Disney dad\u2019.  Methinks you\u2019ve tried to be one but got exasperated cause of you GF and decided to change course at a very bad time.", "I get what you are saying, but sometimes mistakes like this happens and you have to be respectful. It's unfortunate that the GF gave the son all of her snacks, but in an emergency like this, you need to act better and at 10 her should know this.\n\nAt the end of the day, the real mistake the Dad was waiting in line for 2 hours. That's like a 5th of your day dedicated to riding one ride that at best lasts 5 minutes (and that's generous). If I was the Dad, I would have diverted my sons attention and tried to find a different ride. But I hate amusement parks, so what do I know.", "I get what you\u2019re saying thanks.

I don\u2019t want him growing to be a man that thinks the world owes him.", "I didn\u2019t know that, that is so helpful!!! Thank u!", "Did you read any? I never let him get away with this behavior. I wasn\u2019t putting my foot down at Disney I was a bit more lenient than normal but that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not the one who lets him act like this.", "All the rides at disney are like that, tbh. And really, most aren\u2019t worth it. Universal studios has far shorter lines, and more exciting rides, but that\u2019s just me.", "Buddy, I\u2019ve escalated by accident too many times to count. It\u2019s easy for me to stand back, read the situation and judge now. I have no doubt that you were all hot, tired, and doing your best.  I hope next time I get frustrated I remember this and stop myself from being a hypocrite.", "Maybe the part where your girlfriend was aware that the ride should not be abandoned and that maybe she shouldn't have given a bored child absolutely all her snacks?? \nYou can blame him if you want but\nHe is 10\nAnd you two are the adults\nYou were ill prepared not the other way around\nShe literally wanted to go off by herself and you still chose her over him\nI would be furious too. \nYou can justify it however you want. Were adults, when we do shitty dumb things we can try and rationalize it to ourselves after.

Or hey, I'm just some stranger in the internet. I don't care ultimately if you teach your child that you, his father are not beholden to consequence and that one day he will get to be without consequence to those weaker than him.

We can get snacks as soon as we get off the ride.

Lines were maybe 10 minutes max (still too long IMO), but it was better than most times I've been to amusement parks.

Tbh I am concerned about your ex allowing him to act like a toddler, she is doing him no favours and he is going to be in for a rough ride", "Did you ask if anyone else in line had snacks to share? Were you close enough to the end to talk to a staff member about exiting the line and coming back or even getting assistance?", "NTA", "ESH. This all sounds messy.", "NTA!!!! Funny enough I was there and witnessed the whole thing. Your son was acting like a brat ( no offence but we were all thinking it ) you should talk with your EX because that was terrible and I can see how your girlfriend felt kinda embarrassed", "Kid's ten years old. Way too old to be acting like that. I could maybe see an ESH but the kid was absolutely an ass here.", "so it sounds like his mum isn't the only one spoiling him and not saying \"no\", even in very serious circumstances.", "ESH The parents should have dealt with the tantrums years ago, OP should have packed an extra snack in his pocket knowing that Mom might give the kid the last snack, and kid shouldn't be throwing tantrums at 10.", "Emotionally dysregulated moments and not teaching moments.

Wait until you have all calmed down, and talk about all of the things and mistakes that could have made this a better situation including your gf being prepared.", "If she really NEVER let it slide b4, why is she making this post? Makes me wonder tbh. OP if you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s not too late to change your everyday parenting style. Catch up on reading some books that centre on authoriTATIVE parenting. Not authoritarian. Big difference between the two.", "This is absolutely absurd. Children should beable to handel hearing the word NO. And at 10 years old?! OP saved lots of money to goto disney and his child should NOT have acted like that in any way.\n\nAt the end of the day OP is the parent and can vito anything that that child does until they are an adult. OP dont listen to this guy he clearly hasnt been a parent and has a major issue with respect", "Aye. Giving him all her diabetic \u2018snacks\u2019 (read, medicine) was just foolish.", "I was surprised how long it took to get to someone saying this. All of OP\u2019s complaining about the ex always giving in when he and his GF were doing the exact same thing. Can do the same thing and expect a different outcome.", "Even if she does, she failed to keep herself enough. While, out of you three, she's the best, the whole batch is rotten. Your kid for his tantrum, her for failing to take care of herself, and you for how the whole thing went down.\n\nESH.", "You shouldn't have given him your girlfriend's snacks that she needs for emergencies. You complain about your ex giving onto his tantrums but you just did the *exact same thing*.", "Nah man, this wasn't a \"being told no\" situation. The fact that you wanna paint it like that shows how little you value the feelings of children. OP acted shamefully and his child has the right to social consequence. And maybe op can't, if I were op's ex I'd be making a custody push after op picked some cooze over their child having a reasonable time on their vacation. I don't have an issue with respect, I respect children enough to understand their feelings are valid, and even when misguided they are still extremely formative experiences. This isn't behavior that would be tolerated in a normal social setting, if you waited 20 minutes in line and some guy said \" hey my diabetic girlfriend didn't bring enough snacks, we all need to get off the ride so she can go find something to eat, it's okay we can get right back in line\" you'd tell them to go by themselves. Its irresponsible, inconsiderate and downright selfish then, and the fact that it was done to a child doesn't change that. Kinda makes it worse. When someone behaves poorly in favor of a partner you say whatever because you're just some dude. Can't imagine what it's like for a child. A tantrum isn't exactly acceptable behavior, but I see where they get it from seeing as OP will throw a Disney world vacation away in a tantrum. This will be a very damaging experience to their child, and the fact they're here rationalizing their own behavior instead of worrying about the potential damage they've done, tells me all I really need to know about them. \nLuckily for OP, their child is 10, and while they may not want to talk now they will not actually get rid of them. Unless their mother introduces the thought to them, it's not one they'd really come to naturally at 10. But op is setting a shameful example for their child, and should take some time to actually reflect on the damage they may have done here.", "She absolutely should be carrying glucose tabs or something that she doesn't share with the kid.

Lol", "you dont sound like an adult", "I did a halloween event at disney that it rained but didn\u2019t get rained out. It quit after like 45 minutes. But afterwards, the park was empty. Usually if you wanted to meet the seven dwarfs (only available during this event) you would spend the entire night waiting in line. I waited 10 minutes. It was magical for sure. If you hate theme parks but are dragged to one anyway, I highly recommend discovery cove. It\u2019s essentially an aquarium that you get to swim in with all you can eat food and alcohol, with limited attendance. I love that place so much\nDisney also used to have a 3 story huuuuuge arcade of what I assume was literally every game cabinet in existence, and you paid $50 and got to play as much as you wanted. That place was dirty but awesome", "NTA. Your son is ten. He is old enough to know how to behave in public, and the consequences of not doing so. Unless he has some sort of mental challenge that would make emotional control more difficult for him, there's no excuse for a tantrum like that.", "YTA. All the people complaining about the kids behaviour are morons. If you make a 10 year old kid wait in a line (you didn't state how long but I know those Disney queues are huge) and then get out at the end because of a mistake that your gf (who is an adult) made, of course they're going to through a tantrum. I'd be pissed off too.", "This comment is ridiculous. His gf was having a medical issue and there are TONS of lines at Disney including the snack counter. What if she passed out waiting in line because OPs over grown toddler couldn\u2019t handle no?\n\nSome things are more important than a \u201cdream trip\u201d to an amusement park. Disney is no different than any other amusement park it just has the Disney label. It isn\u2019t more important than learning how to not turn into a screaming toddler at 10 years old.\n\nFrankly\n\nDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you *or brings you to Disney*\n\nNTA", "The kid's behavior was definitely way out of line for anyone over 4 years old. I remember going to Disney when I was 10! Somehow I managed not to have full-on screaming fits on the ground, even though one of my parents is disabled.", "The idea that a 10-year old can't understand diabetes is ludicrous. I agree that OP handled this poorly, and that Disney causes kids to regress a bit. But 10 is plenty old enough to understand illness.", "She literally 100% should not have done that. It sounds like you let the child push and push you, and then blow up all at once, when you should\u2019ve shut it down in the beginning - he has the tantrum in line when you wouldn\u2019t give him the snacks, you leave the line and calm down. Now he has a tantrum at the end of the line, you are tired and blow up too, you leave the park and waste your money", "Missed it? It's in the first sentence!! Start at the beginning next time, don't skip to the end for the fun bit.", "YTA for blaming your ex.  You are also a parent. 'Obviously her actions' tell us everything we need to know about you -  how do you expect your son to behave if you can't even take responsibility for him?   You take more responsibility for your adult girlfriend than you do yout child.  Pathetic.", "The issue isn't how far on the spectrum he is though, it's that he MIGHT be, and since it's going untreated that's what would make him act in such a way. However, he could be neurotypical, we have nothing to go off, and even if he's on the spectrum he's evidently spoiled.", "Not much you can do when one parent lets the kid get away with everything and doesn\u2019t say no. The kid will now have the so-called fun parent and then the no parent.", "You clearly know nothing about divorce/separation and coparenting. Courts are freaking idiots and to suggest that\u2019s the way to continually deal with parenting styles or communications is so out of touch I can\u2019t. Do you come from divorced parents or are you divorced?", "So it sounds like your girlfriend is the problem, not your son. Maybe put a little blame on her instead of endlessly protecting her and basically vilifying your son on Reddit who clearly NONE of you are parenting exceptionally well.", "You also could\u2019ve talked to the cast members and they 100% would\u2019ve given you a fast pass to come back - my friends and I were in line, and wanted to go see a show that was happening for the last time that day, and they gave us a pass to come back", "This literally could\u2019ve been solved if you just tried to talk to the ppl at Disney, ppl leave the line for bathrooms. They 100% would\u2019ve let you guys go get a snack, and come back to the front. Hell they probably would\u2019ve given you snacks", "ESH. You and mom (and afterwards son) need to have a serious discussion about what\u2019s going on, what the plan is, and how your son is dealing with situations. Your gf needs to have her own snacks on hand at all times for her health and safety. It sounds like there is very little communication about your sons emotional needs and how you and his mom are addressing them. You need to be on the same page. Having practiced family law, it is not as easy to just say one parent had to do more when the other isn\u2019t. Both parents are involved, responsible and need to be engaged in what the child needs and wants. I\u2019d bet your son is reacting to bigger issues.", "I\u2019m 27 and have a 10 yr old brother. He\u2019s never acted that way with anyone (he\u2019s around many adults). He\u2019s spoiled and gets told no just as much as yes. \n\nYour parenting sucks. Really nothing else to it. There\u2019s a way to demand respect and get it without being scary or forceful. \n\nCo-parenting means y\u2019all need to come up with a plan to stop this crap.", "ESH. I\u2019m going through the same with my stepson, his mom buys him EVERYTHING and never says no so there have been times where we\u2019ve had to deal with tantrums etc. I am also diabetic but he knows that the snacks I bring are for me and he can\u2019t have them no matter how much he asks and that he will have to wait until we go to a shop for a snack or that if we bring snacks for him and he eats them all then he doesn\u2019t get to have mine. I feel like that is a boundary that needs to be enforced from now on no matter what. \n\nI\u2019m terms of the way it was handled in hindsight it could have been handled better but emotions are high and stress is high \nThere\u2019s been times where we\u2019ve had days out and had to \u201cruin\u201d part of it because of tantrums, we\u2019ve started sitting somewhere and explaining that we aren\u2019t continuing until he calms down and we just sit there until he\u2019s calm and then explain why his behaviour is not okay and then continue with the day \nMaybe something you could do? \n\nI know it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re dealing with a Co parent who won\u2019t actually do parent with you so it\u2019s all trial and error unfortunately", "YTA- How it should have gone \\[old school wavy lines indicating going back in time\\] one year ago:\n\nOP: So, son of mine, light of my life and pride of my heart, I have a deal to propose to you. I really, really wanna go to Disney, and I really, really wanna go with you. It would be nowhere near as much fun without you. The problem is you kick off when you don't get your own way, and that just can't happen at Disney. That's the exact opposite of Disneyland behaviour. So here's the deal. I've saved up the money to go. Every time you have a tantrum when you're with me, $50 goes out of the Disney fund and into my savings. If you can go six months and there's still enough money in the fund, I buy the tickets. If there's not you have to earn the rest back by me adding $50 for every visit without any spoiled behaviour. Deal?", "ESH \n\nKids can ride Disney rides alone at age 7, and you removed the safety net in line. That said, a 10 year old shouldn't be throwing toddler tantrums, and definitely shouldn't be rewarded for it. You as the parent could have still diffused the situation and figured out a better solution, though.", "ESH\n\nNo judgement on the kid because 10 is still a child, and Disney brings out the worst in all children - the mix of excitement, boredom, hunger, tiredness, frustration was too much, and I will not judge his entire character at age 10 from that particular scenario. I know you said you offered him a chance to cool down and apologise, but if you didn't start as the adult by saying you're sorry you had to miss the ride and understand it was frustrating, I don't think you ever really gave him a chance.\n\nYour gf screwed up. It doesn't make her an AH necessarily, but the trip was supposed to be abput the kid, and by not being prepared to look after herself, she made it about her.\n\nYou should not have brought your gf if she was your priority. It should have been a father-son trip. If your gf is regularly in a situation where she needs to eat immediately, and she needs you there with her, do you never leave her side? Never go to work? Does she never leave the house alone?\n\nYou also did the worst thing possible with your son. Apparently you let him badger your girlfriend for snacks, and you took no responsibility for having snacks for him or for her. He's your son, not hers. You did the right thing ignoring the tantrum and walking away, and talking to him afterwards, but I think that you didn't handle it very well. You were too emotional yourself, and you left too soon.\n\nI nearly made a similar mistake in Legoland a few years ago. My young child was misbehaving, and I decided we were leaving the park right then. I actually left the front gate, but fortunately I came to my senses while we were still in front of the gate. We talked, and I listened to her, and she calmed down and we went back inside (luckily the security guys were understanding and accepted photo evidence that we were inside earlier). It would have been very unfortunate for us to have missed out on the rest of the day. As a parent it's important to recognise that we can and do escalate situations just as quickly and often as kids do, and de-escalate as soon as we recognise it.", "I am just a parent, but i was wondering the same thing about the child being neurodiverse. A full on tantrum in public for a 10 year-old would be very unusual.", "It\u2019s really hard to do when the kid lives in two houses and one parent\u2026doesn\u2019t parent. \n\nMy husbands ex wife is useless. My 11 stepson is delayed and has literally thrown himself to the ground in a tantrum with her. He is the boss in her house. Whatever he wants. He gets. \n\nAt Dad\u2019s/my house, he doesn\u2019t throw tantrums. He is a completely different kid because I/we don\u2019t tolerate it. We get a little bit of trickling behaviors at our house and school. And that\u2019s what pisses me off. That he\u2019s just out in the world being an asshole because she does nothing to stop it.", "Cooze? Are you even old enough to be on this sub?  You are attempting to advise someone on their parenting, while showing that you have zero manners.  Who would take you seriously?", "Kids, like animals, will quickly learn what they can and cant get away with with different adults. Thats why you get kids who are nightmares at home but well behaved at school and vice versa. If OP had been dealing with the tantrums consistently when he had the kid with him its very unlikely this would have happened.", "Do you know anything about diabetes?  It is a serious condition that can lead to death.  Note I am not talking about how she screwed up by giving all the snacks.  But a diabetic does not choose when to drop their blood sugar.  If it gets too low you will have a seizure, go into a coma, and if it is not corrected you will die.  So this particular issue is not just 'choosing a piece of cooze'.  It is keeping her alive.\n\nI lost out on a trip to Disney when there was an unexpected death in the church and dad had to stay and preach the funeral.   As in the whole trip never happened.   I learned a hard lesson in how you don't always get what you want.   I still talk to my parents and don't hate them, because they had taught me that they would give us other chances to have fun that didn't involve Disney.\n\nTo say that OP deliberately chose is simply wrong.\n\nOP,  do you know what you need to do to prevent things like this?  You start by telling the kid what you expect from them up front...i expect you to behave yourself.   I want to have fun too, so this is what will happen if you behave.  This is what happens if you act up (see below).  Then what  happens when you give a consequence to each time a kid tries to throw a tantrum?   They stop having tantrums.  Initially it usually means you have to give up on something fun or convenient to yourself.   You impose the consequence.   Then put the child in a (timeout) like telling them we will sit at the toilets until you can calm down, give them a time limit or way to regain their composure, and let them scream .  By that I mean something like, when you can calm down and decide to be nice again,  we will go do fun thing. Usually they figure out quickly thzt to act up is less desirable than obeying.   But you have to respond quietly and firmly, WHILE TELLING THE CHILD WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY COOPERATE,  AND GIVE THEM THE CHOICE TO CONTINUE TO BEHAVE LIKE A BRAT OR START HAVING FUN AGAIN. Also, if you can tell them something they can do to help you in the crisis,  like helping you find the closest restaurant,  where they can get something themselves,  that also sweetens the deal.\n\nI feel your willingness to argue with people here leaves a strong impression you yourself aren't acting like an adult much yourself.
