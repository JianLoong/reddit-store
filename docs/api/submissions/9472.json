The only asset they have of serious value is the house in London that they own with a mortgage on it (more on this later), rough estimates put value at about \u00a3600k. The will states that the house is to be split between the three of us, myself and my two sisters. My older sister and myself both live in our own properties that we were only able to purchase thanks to financial assistance from our parents re-mortgaging their house (to the tune of \u00a370k, \u00a335k each). This money is currently being paid back, by my sister and myself, and the agreement is that if our parents pass before the money is paid back then the remainder will come out of our share of the inheritance when the house is sold.\n\nAfter hearing about needing to sell the house, when our parents pass, my little sister has gotten very difficult about the whole situation. It seems like it's come as a shock to her, despite this being the plan for the past 6 years or so, we only spoke about it verbally and she was included in the discussions, it seems as though now it's in writing though it's more real for her? I mean, my parents are early seventies so hopefully they won't pass for a number of years yet but it is a possibility and I thought it would be better to discuss it as a family before they pass.\n\nWhen we said, obviously we would need to sell the house to pay for the inheritance tax and the mortgage etc... my little sister said she would not agree to that as she can't afford to buy a house in London and even with the money from the house sale she would not be able to get a mortgage in London on her partners salary alone (she doesn't work). I said, \"Maybe you'll have to live outside London then, or get a job?\" thinking that was a sensible solution, I'd love to live in London but I can't, so I moved outside London, I'm actually happier for it now, but again, another story... My little sister flipped out saying she has her life in London and her kids are in school in London and that she would not leave the house. I tried reasoning with her by saying how will we pay the inheritance tax on the house and she just said \"I don't care, but you can't sell the house with tenants in it unless they agree to leave and I will not agree to leave\". So then my older sister and I said, as the two thirds majority in this scenario we will evict you. At this point my little sister left the talks crying and hasn't spoken to either of us since. My parents think it was an asshole move to tell her that we would evict her but I don't see any other option here and I'd rather discuss this before the event so everyone knows the plan and has time to prepare for it.

This is why lawyers exist. When the time comes, get one to deal with this. You might consider asking your parents to get a neutral executor for their will", "NTA I don\u2019t know how it works over there, but in the US even if there\u2019s a will you have to open probate when people die, and if your parents don\u2019t own the house because they still have a mortgage on it, it definitely has to go into probate unless somebody has enough cash to pay the mortgage, and even then it might still have to go into probate.\n\nMy dad recently died, he had a will, but because probate was opened everything he owned has to be sold, his bills are paid and then whatever is left goes to me because I was the only one left alive in his will.  If I wanted to keep his car, for example, I would\u2019ve had to purchase it from the estate I believe.\n\nIf your parents don\u2019t want it to happen like this have them contact an attorney, there may be a way to keep it out of probate or whatever happens over there when someone dies. I know here you can do things so that you don\u2019t have your assets going into probate.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't your sister's house. It is your parent's house, and if they pass it will be 1/3rd your house. You went through the arguments very logically.\n\nThat being said recognize that your sister isn't going to be approaching this with clear-headed disinterest. She is clearly having an emotional response. Moving is stressful and disruptive. Yeah, she should have expected it, but she is still just coming to terms with it now. A gentle hand might be helpful.\n\nAlso recognize that evicting your sister right after your parents die would be a hell of a time. No one would come out of that happy. So while it *is* a natural option if your sister refuses to leave, it is also a nuclear option.\n\nIt might be good to think about different options. If your sister could buy your and your sister's 1/3rd shares she would only be paying for 2/3rds of the house. You got a loan from your parents to help you buy your first house. It might be possible to loan her some of your share of the inheritance so that she can afford to buy her house.\n\nI am not close to the financials, so maybe these ideas are ridiculous, but if you can think of ways for your sister to stay it changes the dynamic of the conversation. Instead of \"You have to leave\" it becomes a choice.", "NTA.  Your sister is solely focused on herself and what she wants, which is her choice, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can or should get her way.  She can\u2019t force you and other sister to keep a house.  She can either buy you out or you all sell.  That\u2019s how it works.  Maybe sit down with a lawyer and have the options explained to her so she sees the situation.", "NTA. The house may well have to be sold just to settle the mortgage or care home fees for your parents.  Your sister needs to plan for what she will do.\n\nBut the inheritance tax issue doesn't sound right (and obviously depends on the value of the house and the loan when the deaths occur). But if the house is worth \u00a3600k, jointly owned, and there is not much else, and your parents are married, I can't see how there would be a tax bill. With wills written sensibly, they should be able to pass on about \u00a31m together before any tax is payable.

If that\u2019s the case then it\u2019s normally a term of the mortgage that within X days of the date of death of the survivor or both of them no longer living at the property (eg long term care), you have to repay the mortgage or show them you are trying to do so - eg evidence the property is being marketed for sale.\nIf there is no evidence, they can sell the property but you will end up worse off as they will add legal costs (and it may need to go to court, which would add a lot to the debt).\nAlso, if your sister was living there at the time they took out the loan, she would normally be asked to sign a form saying she would move out after they died. I don\u2019t know if that would ring any bells with her?\nIf your parents need to go into long term care, the Council would probably want the property to be sold to cover costs - they will normally put that off if one party is living there still, but not usually for an adult child who could live elsewhere.\nSuggest your sister looks at shared ownership properties, perhaps? That\u2019s one way onto the ladder. I know it\u2019s really hard in London - it\u2019s difficult everywhere, but particularly there.\nIf it\u2019s not an equity release loan then it is different but they\u2019d usually expect repayment asap.\nI\u2019m a conveyancing solicitor over 25 years qualified - I hope this helps.\nNo judgement - it\u2019s hard for everyone - but please try to sort this out because your parents must be miserable about it.", "Nta.

What do you mean? What do you think happens to people's stuff when they die?

Do you think there's a chance she could convince your parents to cut you out of the will?", "NTA.\nWould it not be possible for the Will to be altered to state that instead of inheriting the house, your parents solicitor will have the house sold at or above market value and split the proceeds as desired by your parents? Or would that just mess with the inheritance tax situation too much? I apologize, i\u2019m no legal expert. Just a thought.", "NTA. It's good you're giving her time to think about this now and figure it out.", "The mistake you made was starting your intention in mixed company.

It would be very out of character for the youngest to try to instigate that and then extremely out of character for my parents to go along with it.", "Similar thing happened near me in the US. Great big old house got divided between the children when the parents passed but one of the kids wanted to live there. He can't afford market rent on the property for his siblings portions and he can't afford to buy the others out. He can veto any tenant that isn't himself and they don't want to sue him to force the sale in court. So now the house has just sat empty for a decade slowly rotting.\n\nParents should really specify in wills that property must be sold or assign it to one owner to avoid these situations.", "Pretty sure that if Parent 1 dies & leaves everything to Parent 2, when Parent 2 dies, there are 2 x inheritance tax allowances to offset against the value of the estate, not to mention the Property Allowance which is ??\u00a3175k. \n\nThis still doesn't affect the dynamic with your sister.  If she's going to inhabit the house, you'd expect her to pay rent to her siblings.  But I've read enough on AITA to know that rarely goes smoothly.", "Yeah my original idea was that her seeing the cost to you would help her understand what she is trying to do. I think at this point time is your friend. I also want to say you are 100% right to talk about this.", "Ah OK, so it probably is her just having her head in the sand than actual malice then.  \n\nI would take a step back, come back to discuss in a month or so when everything is calmed down and then reassure baby sis that nothing is happening any time soon (fingers crossed) but that having a contingency plan in place is probably a good idea\n\nYou and your other sister are being pragmatic.  Baby sis has heard \"Mum and Dad are dead, and now I'm homeless\".", "Honestly, please make sure it's sorted before your parents die, so that they can give their input on what they want done with their house. Otherwise she will just continue to live there rent free, will never buy you out, and you and other sister will end up with nothing.\n\nI say this because it's currently happening to a friend of mine - the mum left the house to both siblings equally, sister wants to live in it, can't get a mortgage to buy out her brother, all the time the house is dropping in value because it's not being maintained properly.", "That's great - but little sis would still need to buy out the siblings", "Yea, this is what my older sister and myself are concerned about. In that she pays far below the market rate to our parents, if she did stay there she wouldn't pay us the market rate and would not maintain the house either so it would depreciate in value.", "Thanks, my older sister and I think it's right to talk about it too.", "Well, we will evict her in that case, as I have made clear, I know it's the nuclear option, but she has made it quite clear that's the only way she's leaving. That's one of the benefits of having the house left to three parties instead of two. But yes, I too would like it sorted whilst my parents are still alive.", "Yes, but it's one less factor to consider and if they go to little sis using it as a reason for selling the house when it's most likely wrong it's likely to rub her even further up the wrong way. This is a situation where you need to get the facts straight first.", "Apparently she doesn't even pay rent. She probably thinks it's already her house."]}
