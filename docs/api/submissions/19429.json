Then, he has no choice nit to pay. There will be fallout, but there will also be the real world consequences you asked for. Those consequences will also impact you.", "NTA. And also bill him for childcare. \n\nThe deal is nephew can go with his parents go. Make that clear to your parents.", "Prepare the itemized bill.\nTell him that he wasted your family holidays and put your parents in health danger. From now you will never take your nephew with your own family.\nIf he complains - and he will - send him the bill as an amiable concession.", "ESH\u2014 your brother is a a-hole for offloading his sick child on his family so he could get a few days of relaxation at the expense of his family, but you can\u2019t fine your brother for letting his kid get everyone sick any more than you can fine a shitty parent for sending their flu ridden child to school and getting kids in the class sick. kids are germ factories who infect everyone they come across. unless the kid showed up at the beach house via a teleportation machine, an adult must have driven him there. it was on you or your parents to say \u201csorry but he\u2019s literally drowning in snot; he ain\u2019t coming\u201d but none if you did so\u2026oh well. lesson learned I guess", "NTA. That\u2019s not going to accomplish what you want and will make the situation contentious. I\u2019d refuse to watch the kid again and tell your parents (well ahead of time) that you won\u2019t be going on a trip that includes you nephew, but doesn\u2019t include your brother or his wife.", "NTA, but why didn't you send the kid back immediately?  What were the arrangements?", "I'd send him a bill for the entire screwed up vacation as well as for all the medicine and clinic bills!!!!!!", "He would be under no legal obligation to pay that bill. ESH", "YTA why did you not send the sick kid home, you have a voice and could have said no.", "ESH. You have no way to force your brother to pay.", "Hopping on the top comment to say: strep requires antibiotics! Don\u2019t use folk wisdom or OTC medications to address it. If you know it\u2019s strep go to a doctor immediately. If untreated strep can lead to other complications. \n\nAnd obviously NTA.", "Sending him a bill is passive aggressive. Just tell him to his face that he shouldn\u2019t have brought his super sick kid on the trip causing you to ruin the whole vacation.", "In this situation, OP is NTA for being upset about that situation, but some of the choices of wording lead me to believe that they\u2019re probably TA in general.", "But small claims court might be funsies.", "This is the way. My daughter suggested that she dress up as a clown and scare the piss out of him at the next family function because he has a serious clown phobia. What's he gonna do? Be mad at his 7-year-old niece for wearing a Halloween costume?", "He could have at least sent the kid with a mask, or warned the other family members so they could bring masks. What a jerk!", "We're all on our way to the Doc-In-The-Box this morning on our way back home. Got one day to get right before we go back to work. Edit: We are remote workers so not in danger of infecting anyone.", "8 hour drive and it would've started a big kerfuffle with my parents who organized this trip. Otherwise, I would have.", "Yeah, bedtime was a little rough, but we managed. I try to tell my girl that different families have different rules, but she didn't stay with grandparents for more than 3 days without us until this past Easter at 6 because my husband planned an amazing trip for my birthday. They also have a new baby, so nephew's been hanging with grandparents a lot while everyone gets into the swing of things which I understand. Infants are a lot of work on a little sleep. I don't think that excuses this though, because it really sucks and it definitely endangered both my parents who aren't in the best health.", "I didn't pick him up; my parents did.", "Her brother dropped the kid off at her parents\u2019, asleep.", "8 hour drive both ways. Whoever had to take him back probably would've caught it in the interim since my folks didn't realize he was sick until they got here, and my mom would've fussed about the gas and keeping the peace. My mom's also 6months out of heart surgery and doesn't need this.", "They are pretty pissed. My dad especially who has been hit really hard and has barely been able to eat or enjoy himself.", "Over in the US? Here in Europe it was a flu & strep combination that was going around. I haven\u2019t been that sick in ages. Took me 3 weeks to recover.", "ESH. OP\u2019s brother is TA for being so inconsiderate and risking the health of others, but anyone suggesting that this childish and petty revenge is anything but AH behaviour is deluding themselves. This is not how adults behave. Don\u2019t enable your brother\u2019s behaviour ever again and have a conversation rather than trying to make him \u201cfeel it in his wallet\u201d. OP doesn\u2019t come out of that looking good either.", "My parents didn't notice until they arrived at our destination and the drive back would've been prohibitive since sil met them part of the way. We arrived after them and by then the chaos was entrenched.", "He always seems to be out of vacation days \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f also they have a new baby at home which I am sympathetic to.", "Not my vacation house. My parents put this trip together and it probably would have played out regardless since someone would have likely been infected on the long trip to return him.", "You need to get your parents onside to set a rule that the kid only comes if the parents do too. It is completely unreasonable to send a sick 3 year old on holidays with family members. If they are going to send the kid alone again next year, then maybe it's time to say you and your family can't make it. \n\nYou can try sending him a bill, but he sounds pretty selfish, so it's unlikely to pay it. I had a similar situation years ago with my SIL bringing a sick child to visit when I was heavily pregnant. We all got tonsillitis, and I was furious. I made sure she was aware of how sick we were and that we were pissed, but there was not much else we could do.", "Do it - not so much with the expectation of payment- but to make him think twice next time he tries. \nNTA", "Just fyi, your brother was almost definitely lying about not knowing kids could get strep throat.  The reality is that adults don't really get it - unless they catch it from their kids.  Chances are really high that your nephew made your brother sick, not the other way around.", "If your brother is even a half decent person then he should feel bad enough knowing he got his parents and family sick. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m guessing you think he\u2019s generally a self centred jerk and that\u2019s why you want to send the bill?", "Did your parents drive your nephew? How fid they not notice he was sick?", "I'm sure you fart rainbows when you're running a fever, broseph, but I do not. I am mad as a hornet about being at the urgent care on my last Saturday before return to work.", "Can you point out some of the wording? I didn't get that impression reading OP's post.", "Elderberry syrup. Do a dose every 4-6 hours on adults.  I\u2019m this shit works.  At least I should say it works great for me and mine. I keep bottles in the cabinet, mostly cause I live long ways from town, don\u2019t want the drive.  The earlier you can get it in your system the better", "I love your 7 year old\u2019s style! NTA btw.", "Your daughter is a petty genius.", "You need more clowns. Hire a bunch of them as entertainment for the party and when he complains, tell him the band you originally hired is off with strep because some asshole didn't keep their sick kid home. I'm talking a veritable fuck ton of clowns. Get the caterers to come as clowns too", "Sadly, I can not only imagine it, I can remember it. Clearly. Vividly. Eww.", "Getting a three year old to wear a mask is often really difficult, especially if they\u2019re not used to it and already sick. The little one should have been at home cared for by his parents. What would have happened if he took a turn for the worse?", "Bro obviously gives zero effs about starting a kerfuffle.  Don't be afraid to rock the boat because refusing to do so only enables further behavior like this.", "Seems worth it given the hellscape you descended into. I say that as someone that had strep throat most of my childhood and even ended up hospitalised a few times. I won\u2019t knowingly enter a building with someone that is even exposed let alone sick.", "So your mom just had heart surgery and your brother still sent his sick kid in the car with her? What a jerk!", "You decided to allow it. YOu could have packed up your family and left - thenn they would not have gotten sick.", "Yeah. So you see the kid, and tell the parents to call the brother to have the kid picked up - or you will not join them at the holiday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP did this to himself, AND to his family. By failing to react appropriately.", "So if it's an 8 hour drive and your parents (who have raised children and know what a sick toddler looks like) didnt realize he was sick until after they arrived then he can't of had symptoms when they picked him up. I'm guessing your angry at your brother because you think that even if your nephew wasn't yet showing symptoms when he left that given your brother was ill he should have anticipated that his child may fall ill and keep him home. \n\nI agree with that sentiment as long as your parents (who I assume picked up the child) didn't know your brother was ill. If your parents knew your brother was ill and took the child anyway then why is your brother 100% responsible. They are adults who raised children. \n\nRegardless, I think it's a bit pointless to ask him to pay. Morally I think he was required to have informed your parents that he was ill and left the decision of wether to risk it with his son up to them as the ppl who were taking him. However, there's no law that says you need to keep your child home because they might develop strep throat and I don't see the point in asking for money you cannot force him to provide. I also think that if your parents knew he was sick they are at least 50% responsible.\n\nYour brothers a moron, but he was sick and probably not thinking it threw with the same capability he would have had he been at full health. Having raised 2 daughters through the horrid daycare years I know that when a child gets sick, everyone gets sick. However, when an adult get sick sometimes only the one adult comes down because we know to stay in bed and don't touch anything. If your brother didn't tell your parents he was ill he should have so they could make an informed choice, if he did tell them he was ill then I think you need to start distributing the blame around.", "I live in Europe.", "I totally agree with this! It's incredibly rude to send a child who is obviously sick on a vacation with other people! It would still be rude if the parents were there to watch their kid, but it is even more rude when they're not!", "Be glad it wasn't German Measles. Your SIL was incredibly thoughtless and selfish.", "I just recovered from strep throat, don't have kids, nor came in contact with kids. Adults can get and pass things too", "They did. Homeboy was asleep, poor kiddo.", "When your throat feels better enough to yell, you can call your brother and tear a strip off him. Hell, depending on how old your parents are, he put their lives at risk.", "Yeah, no. There\u2019s some evidence elderberry might work for colds, but strep is a bacteria that requires antibiotics. Untreated it can develop into scarlet fever or rheumatic fever.", "I work with kids and have seen it take out the entire center I worked at until recently, strep is super contagious. I used to get it all the time as a kid, it\u2019s definitely a big part of the reason why I\u2019m scared of throwing up", "I recently traveled by bus to visit family. Guess what happened? An incompetent mother brought her coughing daughter onto the bus and they sat directly behind me. Kid had Strep. How do I know this? Because not even a week later my throat closes up, I cannot swallow, and am rushed to the ER. After a barrage of tests, doctors confirmed I had the infection. \n\nMy week long trip then turned into a hellish quarantine at my parents house away from my husband all due to a parent refusing to keep a sick child home. Your brother is an ass and, honestly, I\u2019d be skipping out on any family trips with him or his kid for awhile because of his thoughtlessness OP. Just like that mom on the bus, what he did was unsafe and irresponsible to everyone involved, including his own child. Tell him how you feel and take separate family trips for the foreseeable future.", "NTA. His primary responsibility should be to his children. You wouldn't be TA unless he couldn't afford it.", "I used to get it every damned month in Elementary school because the local psycho parents sent their flesh bags of infection into the school.", "Brother did stay home and sent the sick kid so that the brother could be sick in peace. Sent a little snot bomb to blow up the family vacation.  Very selfish.", "Got it when I was 30 and was never around kids.", "Considering how blatantly you are being utilized as free child care, I would never take my nephew again. Let his parents look after him; it's part of their responsibility, and by not being honest and considerate, they would have damaged our relationship.", "I am currently on dialysis three days a week. Mask precautions are few, but I wear mine almost religiously. In 2016 I got pneumonia so severe I had to be put on a ventilator for 5 days. All because people refused to wear a mask when they were sick. Not to mention, not covering their mouth or nose when they coughed or sneezed. Or god forbid someone wash their hands after coughing or sneezing.", "NTA. Since the child was ill, he should have kept him at home. Unfortunate youngster!", "Strep throat is caused by bacteria... It's not a virus.", "Coughing is not part of a strep infection.  In fact, coughing would indicate she had a different concern.  \nYou did likely pick it up from the bud or bus station though.", "It's almost as if a worldwide pandemic and millions of people dead taught us nothing. I'll be masking in enclosed public spaces for the foreseeable future. \n\nI'm so sorry you're so vulnerable to inconsiderate, selfish people. I wish you safety and good health.", "Goodness that sounds awful", "You\u2019re right. It is. I made a human error. Still, doesn\u2019t stop it from being highly infectious or transmissible. \n\nAlso, corrected my error. Thanks.", "I did bud. Can be transmitted (and I quote) from the CDC, \u201cStrep throat is a painful infection in the throat caused by streptococcal bacteria. This type of bacteria is extremely contagious and can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or sharing food and drinks.\u201d \n\nYou must be fun at parties. Don\u2019t begin to school me about Strep after having it an ungodly amount of times as a child and spending, very recently, 5+ hours at an emergency room being pumped full of antibiotics and fluids. \n\nThe child in question also kept complaining about her throat and being unable to swallow properly too. I felt genuinely sorry for the kid. The mother just kept telling her to shut up. I think my assumptions about where I picked up this infection are probably spot on too.", "Yeah try going through cancer 2x during Covid.  People give zero fucks and are okay risking your life for their convenience.", "This 100%. It's their planet and we just visit.\n\nI knew we were fucked on covid. Spent the 4mo leading up to it watching people hack coughs into open air without even using their hands, much less sleeve.\n\nCourse, it never shocks me that people are abject failures when it comes to anything but self-serving.", "I strongly doubt they are a doctor.", "Well, in all fairness they didn't state what kind of doctor they were. Tho, if I had to guess I'd say that they're a Proctologist who can't get enough of their job, elbow deep in assholes all day, and taking it out on AITA in a bizarre twist of irony."]}
