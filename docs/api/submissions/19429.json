Everybody just loves this and we have a very good time together.   \nEvery february we all meet at my partner's (M) brother's (I) house for one weekend, to watch the photos and films from it and plan the next trip.   \nMy sister is living quite near, so we decided to pay a short (2 days, with one sleep-over) visit. We were very happy , because, as vi live in another country, we don't see each other as often, as we would wish. Especially my daughter and sister's son were waiting for this, because they just love each other and love to play together. My sister has also a 3yo daughter. The little girl was sick very often, so their doctor decided, at she should have her tonsils removed. There is national health care in the country, but the waiting time was so long, that my sister decided to do it in a privat clinic, to avoid the long waiting. The little niece was scheduled to operation two weeks from our visit and she should be absolutely sound and healthy to this. So we, knowing about it, also watched our health very carefully, avoiding all the situations, where we could catch something - so we could visit my sister.   \nTwo days before our driving there, my partner's sister(A) called and asked us, if we could give her and her granddaughter (Z) a ride  on our way to I, as he invited them to the half-term winter vacations. The vacations started just after our annual february \"planning gathering\".   \nWe agreed, because she lives anyway on our way there, but I wasn't very happy about it. Our car was loaded full for a trip, plus my sister should accomodate us all for the days. Anyway -she also agreed to this.   \nSo we picked up A and Z and headed to my sister's place. Somehow ca 30 minutes in the car, and I noticed, that Z is coughing very much and has a running nose. Also A was coughing. We made a break on the gas station and I called my sister, that we can't stay with her, because we won't risk, that her little daughter catches something. Our daughter was devastated, because the meeting with her cousin was the most waited event by her. But she, of course, understood, why we can't stay. We only stopped by my sister's house, to give her things I had for her and the children, drank a quick coffee in the garden and headed further, to I's house.   \nLong story short ( ;) not very ), almost everybody there got sick. First our daughter, than I's daughter and granddaughter, him, his wife and many other people - almost everybody attending this \"kayak gathering\".   \nI was SOOO furious at A. She wasn't even a part in the kayak tour, she could wait til monday - so maybe she and Z were sound at the time - not mention to coming, knowing, that there'll be a full house. I didn't called her after this ca 2-3 months (we used to were quite close and good friends before).  \nThis situation teached us one important thing - when somebody's asking for favour, don't jump and agree.
