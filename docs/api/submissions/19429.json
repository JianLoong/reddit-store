So, I can see how they might have jumped at the chance to get a break from him for a week, and how they might have taken that opportunity despite the risk.

My approach would be to refuse to babysit the kid ever again.", "NTA,\n\nHe should have kept the kid at home since the child was sick.  Poor kid!  This is all kinds of tacky.  I don't know how old your parents are, but the elderly can have a much more difficult time with viruses like this.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he refused to pay, but you should definitely send him a bill.", "I don't feel you are TA here at all, but i'm unsure as to whether not sending him a bill would be a good idea.  \n\nI had a similar family vacation where one of my nephews had been sick the week prior to the trip... My sister, her bf, and nephew arrived a day later \"so they wouldn't bring germs\" with them.   The only ones that didn't get sick with this god awful virus were my parents and my other sister's family (they all lived together).  My elderly grandparents, myself, my daughter (we lived in another state), and my uncle's family all got it.  The kids were puking, my grandpa shit himself several times, the smell coming from what left my body into the toilet was the worst thing i've ever experienced.     \n\nIt's been nearly a decade and i still haven't forgiven my sister for this.  Mostly because SHE GOT SNIPPY WITH US FOR SITTING AROUND THE CONDO AND NOT OUT ENJOYING OUR VACATION, seriously wtf.   \n\nSending her a bill would have caused a whole ruckus with the family.  She never would have paid it and would have trash talked me to anyone that would listen.  The drama and fall out wouldn't have been worth the point i tried to make.   Instead, i hope i outlive her so i can tell the story at her funeral \ud83d\ude08", "Your brother was really out of line here, not only in sending his kids away when so ill but also in risking everyone else's health.\n\nNTA though don't expect him to pay up, he'll no doubt play the victim.\n\nHowever make it clear you will not accept parental responsibilities for his kids on this family vacation again.", "NTA, you know, it\u2019s not like we just went through a major pandemic making the world hyper aware of isolation when feeling sick. Strep is very contagious, I\u2019ve seen entire social groups get stricken down with it very quickly. \n\nI would hit him with the bill. You\u2019re already reasonable in not charging him for your time PLUS expenses for unleashing his highly contagious child on your entire family vacation.", "NTA. His kids should be his responsibility first. Only if he were not be able to afford it, you would be TA.", "NTA - I know the toddler couldn\u2019t help being sick but your brother should have stayed home until your nephew recovered. Now, you and your family are sick as well and your wallet has taken a pounding. I\u2019d say go for it", "I would never take nephew again, you\u2019re being mugs and shamelessly used for free childcare. Let his parents take care of him, it\u2019s part of the job description and their lack of honesty and consideration would mean they had just burned a bridge with me\u2026.", "While it won't be popular, I'm gonna say ESH.\n\nYour brother shouldn't send a sick child, but that child didn't drive himself there. He's only 3. So, really, it's also on the person who brought him. Even if it was your brother who drove him there, someone had to have seen that the child was already sick or that your brother was already sick. So it's on those who saw a sick child and still brought him, kept him, or stayed there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why didn't you send him straight back to his parents/", "NTA What he did was dangerous. \n\nA bit of advice, if they have the penicillin shot for strep go for that. It works much quicker and keeps it away. I was on a strep merry go round all fall and winter. Each case took at least two rounds of antibiotics and finally the shot knocked it out and kept it away long enough to get a break.", "NTA Does he not care that your elderly parents are more susceptible to complications?\n\nThere's a reason people shield when sick.\n\nGet well soon", "NTA\u2026but from now on, tell your parents and your brother, you will not.be taking their child on vacation without them.  (At least until he is older).  They either come and mind their own child or he stays with them.  How unfair that you all lost a weeks vacation.  Even if he did not know kids can get strep, which I call bull, his child was clearly sick.  Honestly, once I saw the green snot, I would have been like, oh heck no.  Kid stays with you.", "Unfortunately, that's not much of a deterrent since we live in different states. My parents put this trip together, but were the first people to get sick, so a lot of childcare this week ended up falling to my husband and I. I doubt they'd ever agree to not bring the kid just because his parents aren't coming.", "Strep throat is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, not a virus. \n\nNTA. Be sure to include the cost of a day at the spa and a nice dinner out in the itemized bill that your brother won't pay. You deserve something nice after playing nursemaid all week.", "Hey my new favorite Reddit responder! That was awesome, but the last line was absolutely priceless!!!", "Then your parents can enjoy those trips with kid alone. Take your family elsewhere"]}
