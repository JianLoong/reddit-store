My approach would be to refuse to babysit the kid ever again.", "NTA,\n\nHe should have kept the kid at home since the child was sick.  Poor kid!  This is all kinds of tacky.  I don't know how old your parents are, but the elderly can have a much more difficult time with viruses like this.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he refused to pay, but you should definitely send him a bill.", "I don't feel you are TA here at all, but i'm unsure as to whether not sending him a bill would be a good idea.  \n\nI had a similar family vacation where one of my nephews had been sick the week prior to the trip... My sister, her bf, and nephew arrived a day later \"so they wouldn't bring germs\" with them.   The only ones that didn't get sick with this god awful virus were my parents and my other sister's family (they all lived together).  My elderly grandparents, myself, my daughter (we lived in another state), and my uncle's family all got it.  The kids were puking, my grandpa shit himself several times, the smell coming from what left my body into the toilet was the worst thing i've ever experienced.     \n\nIt's been nearly a decade and i still haven't forgiven my sister for this.  Mostly because SHE GOT SNIPPY WITH US FOR SITTING AROUND THE CONDO AND NOT OUT ENJOYING OUR VACATION, seriously wtf.   \n\nSending her a bill would have caused a whole ruckus with the family.  She never would have paid it and would have trash talked me to anyone that would listen.  The drama and fall out wouldn't have been worth the point i tried to make.   Instead, i hope i outlive her so i can tell the story at her funeral \ud83d\ude08", "Your brother was really out of line here, not only in sending his kids away when so ill but also in risking everyone else's health.\n\nNTA though don't expect him to pay up, he'll no doubt play the victim.\n\nHowever make it clear you will not accept parental responsibilities for his kids on this family vacation again.", "NTA, you know, it\u2019s not like we just went through a major pandemic making the world hyper aware of isolation when feeling sick. Strep is very contagious, I\u2019ve seen entire social groups get stricken down with it very quickly. \n\nI would hit him with the bill. You\u2019re already reasonable in not charging him for your time PLUS expenses for unleashing his highly contagious child on your entire family vacation.", "NTA. His kids should be his responsibility first. Only if he were not be able to afford it, you would be TA.", "NTA - I know the toddler couldn\u2019t help being sick but your brother should have stayed home until your nephew recovered. Now, you and your family are sick as well and your wallet has taken a pounding. I\u2019d say go for it", "I would never take nephew again, you\u2019re being mugs and shamelessly used for free childcare. Let his parents take care of him, it\u2019s part of the job description and their lack of honesty and consideration would mean they had just burned a bridge with me\u2026.", "While it won't be popular, I'm gonna say ESH.\n\nYour brother shouldn't send a sick child, but that child didn't drive himself there. He's only 3. So, really, it's also on the person who brought him. Even if it was your brother who drove him there, someone had to have seen that the child was already sick or that your brother was already sick.

Why didn't you send him straight back to his parents/", "NTA What he did was dangerous. \n\nA bit of advice, if they have the penicillin shot for strep go for that. It works much quicker and keeps it away. I was on a strep merry go round all fall and winter. Each case took at least two rounds of antibiotics and finally the shot knocked it out and kept it away long enough to get a break.", "NTA Does he not care that your elderly parents are more susceptible to complications?\n\nThere's a reason people shield when sick.\n\nGet well soon", "NTA\u2026but from now on, tell your parents and your brother, you will not.be taking their child on vacation without them.  (At least until he is older).  (Read a comment you all live in different states?  How does a three year old get to the vacation place then without his parents?  Why do they never come too since this is a yearly thing?) They either come and mind their own child or he stays with them.  How unfair that you all lost a weeks vacation.  Even if he did not know kids can get strep, which I call bull, his child was clearly sick.  Honestly, once I saw the green snot, I would have been like, oh heck no.  Kid stays with you.", "Unfortunately, that's not much of a deterrent since we live in different states. My parents put this trip together, but were the first people to get sick, so a lot of childcare this week ended up falling to my husband and I. I doubt they'd ever agree to not bring the kid just because his parents aren't coming.", "Strep throat is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, not a virus. \n\nNTA. Be sure to include the cost of a day at the spa and a nice dinner out in the itemized bill that your brother won't pay. You deserve something nice after playing nursemaid all week.", "Hey my new favorite Reddit responder! That was awesome, but the last line was absolutely priceless!!!", "Then your parents can enjoy those trips with kid alone. Take your family elsewhere", "Nta Your parents aren\u2019t totally blameless here either.  They should have put their foot down and told your brother his son was too sick to travel.  They should have put his needs over their want to play parents to your nephew.  Instead they bundled him up and transported Typhoid Mary over state lines.   Are you going to address your parents incredibly lack of thought on the matter.", "If I was your brother Id happily pay it and Im stingy as fuck. I got a free baby sitter for my super sick kid. All I have to do is pay for the drugs? Count me in.", "Give him the bill but don't expect it to be paid. Make the point and then set the real boundary: we are not doing that again.", "Nta but refuse trips where it\u2019s just the kid and not him. He\u2019s a jerk and I hope the whole family is mad at him. The invoice would be more symbolic but still do it", "You need some sort of petty revenge. Sending him a bill won\u2019t help and will make you look just as wrong as your brother, even though I don\u2019t personally agree with that assessment. \n\nThey have small children? I might be tempted to mail a \u201ccare package\u201d full of finger paints, loud instruments (I sent a full sized cowbell to my nephew once when my sister was a jerk,) all the messy and loud toys you can find at the dollar store. Then messy candies. The ones that melt all over. \nThen, and this is the clutch maneuver, you dump in at least 2-3 bags of different shapes of glitter into the box before mailing it. Those funny baby bottles, \u2018congrats\u2019 and wedding shapes are murder to get cleaned up. Chances are they\u2019ll still be finding that glitter when the youngest is moving out to college. \n\nDepending on how blatant you want to be, you could include childhood movies and music that your brother hated too. \n\nHe can\u2019t get visibly or overtly mad that you\u2019re sending a get well soon package for his kid, even if it contains the 4 horsemen of childhood messes.", "NTA. Would you consider just sending him a med bill for just his son and not all of you? Just to maybe ensure you do get some money? I agree with the other comments that I\u2019d doubt he\u2019d pay you for everyone\u2019s bills. \n\nAnother suggestion would be to say the nephew cannot come on the next trip by himself or maybe at all.", "ESH. Paying you back does nothing to reverse their explicit decision to expose your older parents to a virus (post-pandemic no less!) They are morally screwed and you\u2019re better off moving on without them in your inner circle. I would just accept this experience as a breach in trust and respect towards your brother/sil moving forward. A serious conversation with your parents unpacking your sibling\u2019s shittiness is probably a more impactful revenge.", "NTA.  Doubt he\u2019d pay the bill.  I honestly would tear him a new ass and refuse to go on a vacation where you are in charge of their kid again.", "YWBTA to bill your brother for your ruined vacation but your urge is understandable.  It seems to me that your parents, who knowingly took a sick grandchild on a vacation to the beach are almost as responsible as your brother. Magical thinking all way round on their part.", "Did you swab the 'disease vector' ie your nephew and confirm chain of transmission? \nGet a grip it's not polio it's a cold. \nThe way you speak about the kid is horrible.", "YTA. It's not his fault your immune system is so weak that you got sick from a child.", "I took my kids to a NYE party when they were little.  The hosts mentioned their kids had been sick the week before, but \u201ceveryone was fine now.\u201d LIES! All lies! They gave our entire family the stomach flu.

Your brother is out of order.", "So surely if it\u2019s okay for your brother and his wife to not go on the vacation, then surely you can do the same?

Well then, not sure sending a bill will help, (but it will help you let off some steam), but I sure as heck would be giving brother an earful not only about sending a sick child, but how you all lost your vacation time because of him doing so.

Oh wait\u2026pricey.", "I must have missed that strep isn't a bacterial illness during my medical degree, thanks for the tip off..\n\nA swab isn't exclusively for viruses and sure sounds like calling a child a disease vector is laying the blame.", "You see, we have just gone through a massive pandemic and have not become overly conscious of isolation when the world feels bad.
