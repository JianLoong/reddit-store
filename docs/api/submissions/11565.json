My husband and I had a *very* small wedding, 12 people all together. We decided to have a potluck reception which was very fun for the most part but also where the issues began. My mom has very severe food allergies and is sadly allergic to many things, I grew up with her always having to bring her own food and feel very awkward because of it and I wanted to avoid that as best I could at my wedding. We set up two tables for the food to be set on so everyone could serve themselves, one wich was allergy friendly to my mom. I emailed/texted everyone letting them know about this ahead of time and there was a sign on the table, both included her allergies and this went fantastic for the most part. \n\nUntil Ron. He's a cousin of mine I'm very close to and a good friend of husband's. He brought a mac n cheese and went and set it on the allergy free table, I could see specks of brown/black on it which worried me so I asked what it was. He told me it was pepper, which my mom is deathly allergic to. I politely let him know this and but I let him know we can put it on the other table and I moved it there as he now had his hands full with getting a drink. He set his drink down, grabbed his food, and placed I back telling me it's fine. We had a back and forth before he ended up telling me that it's fine, my mom is faking it, and immediately attempted to cross contaminate the other food saying she \"wouldn't even notice\". I immediately kicked him out of the wedding. I threw the lid onto his food, shoved it in his arms and told him to get lost before I remove him myself. He tried to argue but I very loudly told him to do something that I'm not sure is anatomically possible and he finally left.\n\nThe rest of the time was great, my sister cleaned everything he touched just to be safe and threw away his drink so we knew our mom would be safe. Mom was incredibly happy to be so included though she was embarrassed by the whole ordeal. A few days afterwards I had several family members, most who weren't at the wedding but a few who were, tell me I shouldn't have kicked him out. I've been told how embarrassing it was for him since it was such a small and intimate wedding and how others are asking why he's not in any reception pictures, and I should have just ignored him and moved his food when he wasn't paying attention. My husband is on my side and immediately ended the friendship. \n\nIt's causing a lot of family drama and while I don't feel bad in the slightest I am wondering if I did the wrong thing.

So yes, he showed he couldn't be trusted and you had the right to kick him out.\n\nIt's irrelevant what the relatives who were there think; absolutely irrelevant. You don't have to explain anything to them.

Like, you were going to serve his food. Anyone who wanted it was going to be welcome to eat it. None of this makes any sense . . . Why would it even matter to him which table his food was on? Why would someone insist that their food be on an \"allergy free\" table at all? \n\nLike, I don't mean arguing about your mother's allergies. Clearly he's an AH who doesn't believe that she's allergic or whatever. But even if it was about OTHER PEOPLE'S allergies...again, if you told him that certain foods needed to be on the other table in case of allergies in general, WHY WOULD HE CARE or argue about it? Was he drunk? Does he just have some weird attachment to that particular table? So, so odd. But no matter what, you're NTA. I'm dying to know what his rationale was, though.", "NTA - this goes beyond him not even reading your explicit instructions on what could or could not be on the allergen free table, he went so far as upon being personally told his food wasn\u2019t suitable for your mum to insult her for the sole reason it could stay on a particular table? You were literally moving it I\u2019d imagine c 1 metre away from its original location.. what an obnoxious cousin", "NTA.  It\u2019s a deathly allergy.  The fact that he put it back and was not remorseful is disgusting.", "NTA. He embarrassed himself. I'd avoid inviting him to anything else that includes your mother from now on.

He not only disrespected you by not paying attention, but then he accused your mother of faking her allergies, despite the fact that he has apparently seen her bringing her own foods to nearly every family function.  Then, he intentionally spread a known allergen to other dishes that had been set aside and non allergenic.  \n\nHe decidedly put his own family member in harm's way at your wedding to try a power play.  This has the feel of an old argument.  \n\nGlad your sister was there to help, and that the rest of the event was enjoyable.  Congratulations on your recent marriage.\n\nIf I may ask though, OP. I am unfamiliar with the Gender you listed what is an I?", "NTA. He was dead ass willing to put your mom's life at risk to prove a (ignorant) point and disrespected your wishes at YOUR wedding.

Be blunt.", "NTA\n\nAlso, while IANAL, I'd be surprised if deliberately trying to contaminate someone's food with something you've been informed could kill them wouldn't count as attempted murder.

At all. \n\nEven IF she wasn't really allergic (I'm not saying she isn't), you still told him where to put the food. He decided to create drama and cause problems.  That's just at the beginning.

He actually said your mom was taking her allergy and attempted to cross contaminate the other foods just to prove a point ?  I honestly hate people like that.  I have food allergies as well as other allergies and actually got told that being bit by red ants was \"no big deal\" after I was bitten multiple times and started breaking out in hives.  It was one of those moments like, seriously?  Even after taking Benadryl (didn't have an epi pen) I still had hives spreading and was getting chewed out for not babysitting because of red ant bites.", "NTA, he sounds arrogant", "NTA but curious. If he is from your husband's side (friend), what made him think your mother is faking it? That is usually a statement that has history behind it.", "NTA. Potluck weddings are a thing, and if most of the family is used to accommodating said allergies, why was it an issue for him so suddenly? Everyone else was going to be able to eat his food, yeah? \n\nI have family members with very weird allergies, including myself. I had to sit my caterer down and make sure they knew how severe it was, but I'm debating on making a pasta bar by myself for 100 people (easiest way I could come up with accommodating most allergies/intolerances thanks to the variety of noodles and sauces) because I have been to the ER from several cross contaminations, even after mentioning it to the staff. It's not as foolproof as many think.\n\nUnless you have an allergy or are close to someone who has one, you just never truly understand how bad it can be. I got sent to the ER once because I went to a restaurant that didn't even serve tree nuts (one of my allergens) and had a staff member eating cashews as a snack right before I got my food and they had touched my plate, so I went into anaphylactic shock. Another time I went to a fancier place that had linen tablecloths and napkins and they washed them in Tide, which I broke out in hives from and felt like my skin was burning. I wish I was joking... I digress.\n\nKudos on you for protecting your mother! Your cousin can definitely go do exactly what you implied. He doesn't get to play with other people's lives like that.", "NTA. Your cousin has decided that your mother is faking a life-threatening allergy. He decided that your wedding of all places was the best venue to prove that she is lying. He intentionally endangered her life. You tried to simply move the food, and he moved it back and tried to contaminate the safe food. He made it clear that he was on a mission to expose your mother to allergens.
