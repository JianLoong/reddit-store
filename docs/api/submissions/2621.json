I of course said yes (probably my first mistake) and allowed her to move in with me in October of 2022. Our agreement was that she could move in without a deposit and to pay her first months rent on November 1st. \nAfter totaling the bills for her first payment of rent, I advised her 3 weeks in advance that she only owed $875 instead of the agreed upon $900. \nA week before November 1st, she informed me she could only pay me $500 for rent. I told her that would not do so i insisted she payed the full $875 in which she did, but she paid me on November 5th. 4 days late. \n\nNow tonight November 17th, my cousin texted me while I was at work where I am unable to talk on shift telling me she will only be able to pay $650 for rent for the next couple months. \nBeing incredibly upset since I have very little notice that I\u2019ll have to pay $225 more than what I was anticipating ontop of the fact she waited until the last minute AND texted me rather than asking me in person. \nI agreed for this month only I can do $700 if she also deep cleans the kitchen and bathroom to make up for the remainder (which I feel is generous) .\nI ended the conversation with if she isn\u2019t able to pay the full cost of rent which is $875, she will no longer be able to rent the room any longer. \nI am able to pay rent all alone, although I am not trying to support another human being and also love living alone. I would have never agreed to have her move in if I knew she would need to to financially support her.

If she agreed to a certain amount for rent and is reneging now, you have every right to ask her to leave. Sounds like she is trying to take advantage of you being family, thinking you'll let her get away with it. If you don't nip that in the bud now, she'll never start paying the original amount she agreed to.", "She's mooching, kick her ass out before she starts eating your groceries too lol", "No, you had an agreement which your cousin didn't uphold. However, and mind you this is just my opinion, it's also super cold hearted seeing as your cousin is probably in a tough financial situation right now.", "Not Enough Info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the info given in general I'd say you're not the AHole, but are perhaps being a little harsh, BUT only if she's in a bad financial situation.\n\nYou should not be obligated to support another person financially, BUT If she's in a bad financial situation, and can't afford or find another place to live, (yet you're able to afford the entire place yourself) maybe you could make some sort of agreement (like she pays $650 for a few months, BUT compensates by doing most of the chores, maybe some cooking, etc.), OR maybe if you talked about it further, you could get her to just pay the amount agreed upon. \n\nALSO - OP, you should DEFINITELY have an agreement or contract drawn up, and should have done this, even if she is your cousin. I'm a landlord myself, things can get EXTREMELY complicated if you don't have a very specific agreement IN WRITING. There are lots of laws in place to protect tenants from unfair treatment by landlords, and sometimes, it can be really difficult to kick someone out, even if they're violating the agreement you had, since it's really hard to prove if it's not in writing, so you could REALLY land yourself in some hot water if you don't have a written contract (even literally just a document you type up yourself and both of you sign, stating the terms), and it might be hard for you to get her out even if she is violating the terms of your agreement. Even with, and honestly ESPECIALLY with friends or family in any sort of business or situation when money is involved, things can get really tricky. \n\nIf her financial situation is perfectly fine, however, then she's definitely the AHole here, because you had an agreement and she's trying to change the terms at the last minute, and get something for free.\n\nHard to tell because there's not enough detail provided, and I don't know what your relationship with your cousin is like or has been like in the past.", "Need more info in order to really see the full picture. How much is your rent and are you expecting her to pay equal share? \n\nSounds like you need to sit down with your cousin, and have a very good conversation. Find out why she is struggling financially. Ask her how long she plans to stay or if she is looking at a place of her own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I sympathize with your cousin only cause I was in the same boat not too long ago, and finances are really difficult to manage after the end of a long relationship. On the other hand, if you feel like you're being taken advantage of, you have every reason to kick her out."]}
