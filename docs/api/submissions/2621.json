I of course said yes (probably my first mistake) and allowed her to move in with me in October of 2022. Our agreement was that she could move in without a deposit and to pay her first months rent on November 1st. \nAfter totaling the bills for her first payment of rent, I advised her 3 weeks in advance that she only owed $875 instead of the agreed upon $900. \nA week before November 1st, she informed me she could only pay me $500 for rent. I told her that would not do so i insisted she payed the full $875 in which she did, but she paid me on November 5th. 4 days late. \n\nNow tonight November 17th, my cousin texted me while I was at work where I am unable to talk on shift telling me she will only be able to pay $650 for rent for the next couple months. \nBeing incredibly upset since I have very little notice that I\u2019ll have to pay $225 more than what I was anticipating ontop of the fact she waited until the last minute AND texted me rather than asking me in person. \nI agreed for this month only I can do $700 if she also deep cleans the kitchen and bathroom to make up for the remainder (which I feel is generous) .\nI ended the conversation with if she isn\u2019t able to pay the full cost of rent which is $875, she will no longer be able to rent the room any longer. \nI am able to pay rent all alone, although I am not trying to support another human being and also love living alone. I would have never agreed to have her move in if I knew she would need to to financially support her.

If she agreed to a certain amount for rent and is reneging now, you have every right to ask her to leave. Sounds like she is trying to take advantage of you being family, thinking you'll let her get away with it. If you don't nip that in the bud now, she'll never start paying the original amount she agreed to.", "She's mooching, kick her ass out before she starts eating your groceries too lol", "No, you had an agreement which your cousin didn't uphold. However, and mind you this is just my opinion, it's also super cold hearted seeing as your cousin is probably in a tough financial situation right now.", "Not Enough Info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the info given in general I'd say you're not the AHole, but are perhaps being a little harsh, BUT only if she's in a bad financial situation.\n\nYou should not be obligated to support another person financially, BUT If she's in a bad financial situation, and can't afford or find another place to live, (yet you're able to afford the entire place yourself) maybe you could make some sort of agreement (like she pays $650 for a few months, BUT compensates by doing most of the chores, maybe some cooking, etc.), OR maybe if you talked about it further, you could get her to just pay the amount agreed upon. \n\nALSO - OP, you should DEFINITELY have an agreement or contract drawn up, and should have done this, even if she is your cousin. I'm a landlord myself, things can get EXTREMELY complicated if you don't have a very specific agreement IN WRITING. There are lots of laws in place to protect tenants from unfair treatment by landlords, and sometimes, it can be really difficult to kick someone out, even if they're violating the agreement you had, since it's really hard to prove if it's not in writing, so you could REALLY land yourself in some hot water if you don't have a written contract (even literally just a document you type up yourself and both of you sign, stating the terms), and it might be hard for you to get her out even if she is violating the terms of your agreement. Even with, and honestly ESPECIALLY with friends or family in any sort of business or situation when money is involved, things can get really tricky. \n\nIf her financial situation is perfectly fine, however, then she's definitely the AHole here, because you had an agreement and she's trying to change the terms at the last minute, and get something for free.\n\nHard to tell because there's not enough detail provided, and I don't know what your relationship with your cousin is like or has been like in the past.", "Need more info in order to really see the full picture. How much is your rent and are you expecting her to pay equal share? \n\nSounds like you need to sit down with your cousin, and have a very good conversation. Find out why she is struggling financially. Ask her how long she plans to stay or if she is looking at a place of her own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I sympathize with your cousin only cause I was in the same boat not too long ago, and finances are really difficult to manage after the end of a long relationship. On the other hand, if you feel like you're being taken advantage of, you have every reason to kick her out.", "NTA. Why do people assume b/c you have some matching DNA you can teach them like shit. Did you sign a contract? If you did, they are breaking the law and can be brought to court. This is a business arrangement and should be treated as such.", "Yes this. How much is her/his total rent ? \n\nDoes the cousin have to pay half the rent just for renting one bedroom ? Plus utilities? \n\nIs she suffering financially? Maybe she was depending on the boyfriend financially and now she is on her own . She is starting from the bottom \u2026", "Hm, YTA. Sounds like you are trying to profit off her", "Your YTA. You have to pay the rent one way or another.  600 is alot better than her leaving and get 0.", "For reference of our relationship. We are the same age 23 females, and we haven\u2019t seen nor spent too much time together since 2012. We aren\u2019t bonded and out situation if very much more roommate rather than family type of deal. \n\nI did reach out last night offering to take $700 if she were to deep clean the kitchen and bathroom (since she is a professional cleaner). She has not replied to me at all. I would have this conversation in person but she is unwilling and is pushing to have this conversation over text instead. I\u2019m very frustrated so that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m sounding so harsh. \nWe do have an agreement drawn out and that\u2019s where it\u2019s even more irritating is that she agreed to something she knew she wasn\u2019t able to hold herself to and is taking advantage of the fact that I am financially capable to take a heavier load than her. Regardless, if she wasn\u2019t family I don\u2019t think she would be asking this of me. \nShe is financially unstable but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s on me to support her, especially since she\u2019s beating around the bush, avoiding me, and not being direct about anything. She has the ability to live with her parents but that means she has to move further away from her (ex) boyfriend which she does not want. \nFor example one of her reasons for not being able to pay rent is because she doesn\u2019t have enough gas money. For the last two weeks 10 out of the 14 she has been driving 30 miles to her boyfriends house and 30 miles to work. We live 8 minutes and 5 miles away from her work. \nShe\u2019s also not looking for any government aid or assistance such as food stamps or welfare gas, so if she\u2019s not gonna out in the effort to better her situation, how can I?", "NTA. Not even close. Pay up or leave.", "INFO: how much is rent? $900 for a bedroom is insane unless you\u2019re in like NYC or LA. Even then if you can afford the entire rent yourself why are you kicking your cousin when she\u2019s down. Is she spending her money on toys and tech for her, or is she genuinely struggling to come up with rent? Idk I\u2019m getting major AH vibes from this entire post.", "The rent is $1550 and utilities are $200. We split it 50/50 and share everything in the house hold. I do tend to cover dish soaps, dishwasher liquid, detergent, toilet paper, hello fresh and all other house hold necessities due to her lack of fanatical stability. \nI have tried to speak to her although she is very not willing to confront and insist on texting. It\u2019s very hard to communicate when someone else is not willing :/ \nShe was depending on her boyfriend before he broke up with her. My issue is, she agreed to being able to pay $900 originally, and now she\u2019s not able to up hold her end of the deal. I feel like I\u2019m financially supporting her which I don\u2019t believe would happen if we weren\u2019t family.", " but I never agreed to support another human. I\u2019d rather have my space back than have to pay the extra cost of having someone live here.

I also purchase all house hold necessities such as toilet paper, laundry detergent, dishwashing soaps, Hello fresh etc. I can afford it but not comfortably, and I depend on her to make her half of the rent just like she does me. I don\u2019t know how she spends her money and we are not close and she hasn\u2019t spoken to me in 2 weeks due to the fact she has been driving out of town to sleep at her boyfriend every single night. \nI totally get where you\u2019re coming from. I am defiantly frustrated and it\u2019s showing.", "I would  advise tomorrow the cousin out fast before getting  Tennant right (in usa) the stories I read are horrible. \nNta"]}
