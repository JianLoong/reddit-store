There is no one I could talk to for six hours nonstop every day", "NTA. Also I'd run away from anyone demanding I spend 5-6 hours daily talking to them on the phone.", "NTA, but sounds like it's time to start setting boundaries. If you tell her you're tired, but she pushes to continue chatting anyway, she's the one with the issue. If you're not speaking up, then you need to start doing so  Nothing wrong or rude about saying, \"I'm getting sleepy, I'd better go.\" and saying your goodbyes.

I'd fall asleep no matter how scintillating the conversation.", "NTA anyone would probably fall asleep if they spent 6 hours on the phone. Your gf has no right to get mad", "NTA.

Better get her out on a date if you have so much free time.\n\nThose lengthy phone calls are not normal. No wonder you fall asleep. Does she talk by herself for an hour or two before she realizes you're sleeping?", "NTA, hope you guys work it out", "INFO: Do you fall asleep under other circumstances that could be considered inconvenient?  \n\n\nWhile it may be that you just having issues with being up past your normal bedtime, you could be suffering from sleep apnea. \n\nAnyway, NTA (double NTA if you do have sleep apnea).", "NAH. I can see where she might feel ignored or rejected by you falling asleep, but if it is getting late and you are dozing off, especially during a prolonged silence, that\u2019s understandable. Particularly if the conversation has been going on for hours. \n\nIs there a reason why you can\u2019t just say, \u201cOkay, honey, I\u2019m wiped. Time to say good night\u201d? Then you can end the conversation and go to sleep. \n\nIf you were ever to move in together, one of you will typically fall asleep before the other. To me, this sounds like an over the phone version of that", "As someone who fell asleep while getting a blowjob once, NTA.\n\nAnyone would fall asleep after conversations that long tbh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You work a long day and want to get ready for the next one and unwind from that day.  How does a 5-6 hour phone call *everyday* fit into that schedule? Not only would I fall asleep, I imagine I would be bored stiff at least half the time.\n\nYou've been dating for 3 months, can't your situation normalize a bit?  It seems extreme that she wants to talk on the phone for almost 25% of every day.  You need to eat, sleep and work during the day also.", "NTA. Good lord that is an insane amount of time to be talking on the phone. And every day?! You need to talk to her about setting realistic expectations. \n\nI was in an LDR for 3.5 years and we spoke on the phone  maybe twice a week for probably an hour max.", "Agreed. Even when I was in a long distance relationship we would talk for about 2 hours max, and not every day.", "What do you think is a good amount of time to spend on the phone?", "I hear you\u2026 what\u2019s a good amount of time do you think we should talk on the phone for?", "It is a pretty long time, I just thought this is what all couples do during their honeymoon phase", "Thank you, I\u2019ll definitely start doing this", "We go on dates at least twice a week\u2026\nShe notices within 2 minutes from what I gather\u2026. She normally goes \u201cbabe?\u201d A couple of times before she drops the phone and calls me again so that I can wake up from the phone ringing", "Thank you", "No, not really\u2026 I do fall asleep in the cinema though and complain about being tired all the time but like at work or school I don\u2019t fall asleep at all", "My boyfriend, when we were still long distance, once fell asleep during a sexy phone call. When I realized what happened I started laughing to myself and woke him up and said good night. I may have lovingly teased him about it a time or two but who actually gets mad about that?", "Like 30 minutes a night. It sounds like you do nothing in your free time but talk to your girlfriend on the phone.", "Is there really any reason to spend more than an hour on the phone?  Do neither of you have anything else to with your life such as cook dinner, wash dishes, laundry, socialize with your friends, watch television?  Do you ever get to do anything with anyone other than her?  you both need to have your own lives.", "Is this a long distance relationship, or do you see each other often?\n\nEither way, I'd say an hour isn't unusual, maybe two hours max. I get that sometimes you can be in the phone to someone when you're each doing your own thing, just being connected by phone, but if you're ready to sleep, then that's the time to sign off, and if you've already been in the phone for hours then she shouldn't be offended by that.", "30-45 minutes would cover literally everything that happened during my day. But I could get away with far less if we were talking every day and seeing each other multiple times a week. Five to six hours seems kinda codependent.", "No. It\u2019s not. Especially not when you\u2019re not long distance and not in high school.", "Um. Im honestly concerned. Her needy phone habits are like, high school stuff. I told my husband about this post, he is also worried about you with this lady. From what you\u2019ve written, she\u2019s too much. She should have things to do, like cooking/eating, showering. It\u2019s not normal for a 25 year old woman to demand this much time of her boyfriend. She doesn\u2019t sound very well-adjusted."]}
