You should not have to share it with your parents, let alone a 3yo.\n\nI wish I could say your siblings will become more responsible, but I know many teenagers and young adults that cannot keep track of their chargers.

It makes me crazy when I don\u2019t have a charger available. As a parent, in this case I can say it\u2019s easier to just solve the problem at hand (find the kids a charger) than deal with the heavier parenting task of teaching the kids actions have consequences - keep up with and take care of the charger, or you basically won\u2019t have an iPad. So I get it from your dad\u2019s perspective. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should have to pay the price. Also, I still hide my chargers from my 13yo for the reasons you\u2019ve outlined. \n\nAs an aside, I\u2019m all for teaching kids how to do things for themselves, but when my kids were that young, I think I charged devices for them. I don\u2019t think I left chargers with them, because it\u2019s predictable they would get lost or broken by kids that age.", "NTA. If the charger was given to you, you get to decide who uses it. Given their history, they aren't responsible enough. This isn't even an insult - they're just too young (who gives a 3 year old anything that they can break? They will always find a way...). \n\nYou might offer to charge things for them (they give you the tablet or whatever and you put it on/take it off), but that probably won't end well if you're not home to make sure they don't help themselves. As it is, I'd probably try and make a habit of bringing the charger with me when I went somewhere (e.g., put it in a backpack when you go to school).", "NTA\n\nSee if your dad can install (or have installed) a wall outlook that also has one or more USB outlets built in.\n\nThat will make it difficult to break and pretty much impossible to lose.\n\nOr even a plug in power strip that includes USB ports.
