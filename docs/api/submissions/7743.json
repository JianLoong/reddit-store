He then woke you up to vent, knowing you had to be up at 5am. Yes, he was pissed off, but that doesn't make it an emergency, and he had 2 choices. Wait until the morning, and let you know that he was finding another solution to your living situation or if he really couldn't handle staying there one more night, wake you up enough to let you know whats going on then leave for the night.   \n\nI can't understand all these Y T A comments.", "NTA", "Info: what was the emergency?

In order to do that, you need to be alert and pay attention.  If you are like me, you can't do that when you are half asleep.

It's reasonable to not notice texts while you're asleep.

An emergency doesn't have time for a conversation. It does kinda suck that you weren't able to listen to him or he won't talk now.\n\nMaybe go out for brunch or something with just him and explain to him that you were out of it last night.

I don't think your husband is healthy mentally or emotionally and you've definitely been abused looking at your off my chest posts. Your husband is a dick and you should definitely be looking at setting yourself and your kids up for security and safety when your relationship ends. \n\nNTA, but your husband is.", "INFO:\n\nWhat was the emergency?  What harm was he worried about?\n\nI can envision situations where a quiet 'wake up and start packing, quietly' is perfectly appropriate.", "NTA - if there was no violence/disaster (fire, flood, etc) and he can't articulate why you and your kids suddenly need to pick up and go, then it isn't an emergency.", "NTA", "NTA - but get out of the in-laws immediately, just going to be toxic and your kids do not need that. You don't want what happens while y'all are staying there to ruin their relationship with the grandparents.", "Mixed.\n\nAs it turns out you didn't actually need to leave the house, then a lot of what your husband has claimed isn't true. But it doesn't seem like you knew that at the time.", "NTA", "weak YTA\n\nIf your husband was genuinely distressed and it sounds like he was you should have got up to help him deal with it.  Some things are more important than sleep.", "EMERGENCY notice on the phone, comes into the room after like 2 hour. The emergency seems to have been his ego and pride hurt. And for these reasons he wanted to malr his wofe and 2 kids get out kf the houde in the middle of the night, even though wife has to wake up super early in thr morning and kids probably have school or something. He id making his problems everybodyd problems.", "NTA are you married to a toddler or a teenager?", "YTA", "A potential domestic abuse situation is an emergency. On which planet is it not", "This is the type of crap my dad has pulled my entire life, and you\u2019re right- it\u2019s childish as hell.  \nMy actual c-ptsd response to this entire story was a knot in my stomach and anger at the husband for acting like that, because I remember so many fights my dad would start with his parents over perceived slights that would end up with us having to rush out of the house in the middle of the night to sleep in the car while he acted like it was his parents fault he rushed us all out in a tizzy.", "Edit: I misread.", "She has another post about her marriage on Offmychest.

ESP?", "If the way you tell someone in the same house there's an emergency is by TEXT, its not a fucking emergency.", ">So you don't think it's reasonable to wake your partner in an emergency and evacuate the house? \n\nIt absolutely is reasonable to wake your partner in an emergency. An emergency is something like \"the house is on fire\", or \"we're being attacked by zombie bears\". Something where there's actual danger, and *you need to leave now*. An argument with your parents is not an emergency unless someone has threatened violence, which it does not seem like happened.", "There was no emergency, so why would they evacuate?", "Wake them with a text from the next room? NO that is not how a reasonable person would evacuate a house in a true emergency.,\n\nHe came in AN HOUR LATER to see why sleeping wife did not respond to texts.  If it was a real emergency he would have gone to the bedroom to wake her.", "So answer the question.  What was the emergency?", "yikes...it would seem so...", "No, i am not saying that. I am wondering if he is the type to exaggerate, overreact or blow things out of proportion. If it was really an emergency, why are they all still there? Or maybe he does this often, so nobody takes him seriously anymore.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23Domestic abuse. More like his pride and ego are hurt. And this is not an emergency he needs to wake his wife and kids up to get out of the house in th emiddle pf the night. This is just super stressful for everyone, especially for kids.", "Nobody said he couldn't leave. He could get out and cool his head. Why fuck up wifes sleep when she needs to wake up at 5am for work!", "Having kids has nothing to do with hearing your husband out or not. I didn't say she should have packed her bags when he said so. But hearing him out when he needed to vent and talking him through it so he could calm down is what I think she should have done. Otherwise, it just seems dismissive of his own emotions. He probably was being emotional when he said it was an emergency, but that's worse cause he was ignored and dismissed when he clearly was distressed.", "according to OP that's what he's doing now, isn't it? He's staying put and shutting up about it.", "By taking the time to listen to her husband.\n\nImagine reddit response if OP was a man.", "Because her husband is mad at his dad.

Seems slightly manipulative to me but that\u2019s just my opinion.", "NTA, then.  That's childish manipulation, at the very least.", "Your husband's treatment of you is the emergency.", "I hope you understand that this is because there *was not*, in fact, an emergency?\n\nSounds like your husband is being pretty dramatic. Does he have a tendency to blow things out of proportion?", "Oh that\u2019s just crazy.", "I really did disagree with these comments and was fully ready to say he was hurt and vulnerable and trapped in the space that he felt that way in and ask how you couldn\u2019t see that. Then you said you\u2019re still there in the house and I was 100% sure you were the AH but this changes it. It\u2019s so childish and overly dramatic that it has me questioning if any of this was actually worth getting upset over in the first place. NTA"]}
