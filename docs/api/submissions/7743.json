Then came up an hour later. If you know your partner is sleeping and there's an *actual* emergency, you don't do that. Also if it was so important to leave he wouldn't be content to stay now and give you the silent treatment.", "NTA.\n\nYou need your sleep to be able to do your job.  That's being responsible.\n\nHe was arguing with his father about ancient history and wanting to make a dramatic exit in the middle of the night.  That's being childish.", "NTA. What these Y T A posts are blatantly leaving out is that your husband texted you \u201cEmergency\u201d but then waited for at least a WHOLE HOUR to come up to you. If it was truly an emergency he would\u2019ve came to you much quicker, and instead of ignoring you the next morning he would\u2019ve actually talked to you about it.", "NTA: You were sleeping. Few people are coherent when woken out of a dead sleep. Go to work, then try to meet him outside of his father's house after work to talk things out.", "NTA, he texted you that it was an emergency, knowing you were already in bed and probably already sleeping. He then woke you up to vent, knowing you had to be up at 5am. Yes, he was pissed off, but that doesn't make it an emergency, and he had 2 choices. Wait until the morning, and let you know that he was finding another solution to your living situation or if he really couldn't handle staying there one more night, wake you up enough to let you know whats going on then leave for the night.   \n\nI can't understand all these Y T A comments.", "NTA", "Info: what was the emergency? I assume you guys are now sleeping elsewhere, right?", "INFO: is husband often over-dramatic?  It doesn't sound like it was such an emergency after all.", "NTA. \n\nThe leaving with the kids could wait to the next day if you were already asleep for the night.  How is he not selfish in making that demand after you're already asleep and have kids involved in the mix?  Most people require a good night's sleep to be functional the next day.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you should have a serious discussion with your husband about what he wants/needs regarding living in his family's house.  In order to do that, you need to be alert and pay attention.  If you are like me, you can't do that when you are half asleep.  Maybe you can schedule an hour or two away from the house  (at a restaurant or coffee place or library) to discuss/listen to what your husband wants to say.", "NAH\n\nThere are some problems but I don't know if anyone is particularly assholeish or innocent here. It's reasonable to not notice texts while you're asleep. It's not reasonable to have a conversation in the middle of the night.\n\nIt also sounds like your husband might have overstated the emergency if he won't talk about it now. An emergency doesn't have time for a conversation. It does kinda suck that you weren't able to listen to him or he won't talk now.\n\nMaybe go out for brunch or something with just him and explain to him that you were out of it last night. That you want to know what's wrong and are open to getting an airbnb or something if the house isn't safe. Of course he might have realized he overreacting and is now kinda of embarred.", "YTA.\n\nIf it's an emergency and he needed to get out, that's when you **listen** to your partner.

I know you need your sleep but this is a bad news bears situation. You guys need to be in a long-stay hotel already. He is being petulant but you need to put your foot down and move your family into a safer space. \n\nI wake up at 4:40 AM for work so I know it\u2019s hard. You guys both need to work on communication. Your husband is scared and needing you right now. It wasn\u2019t an emergency and at the same time, this is an issue you gotta deal with sis. \n\nI feel this will hopefully be a temporary problem but you should definitely go low contact with your in-laws. There\u2019s some history there we aren\u2019t seeing.", "YTA\n\nHe said emergency, that means emergency and he needed to leave. Sick days exist if you couldn't work due to missing out on some sleep.", "YTA. Seriously? He said it was an emergency - did you not believe him? Does he often make up lies to interrupt your sleep?", "YTA.\n\nPart of the deal that comes with being married is listening to your partner when they're upset, even if they don't make sense or are in the wrong. He was clearly upset and wanted you on your side. Moving out was probably an overreaction, he probably just wanted to be listened to.\n\nYou just turning away saying I need to sleep probably hurt him a lot when he was already hurt. Yes I understand the importance of sleep, but it's one day, and you can always take a day off or just wing it somehow.\n\nYou don't seem like you care about your partner that much.", "YTA. As someone with a toxic family, if we were staying with them and I woke my partner up to say \u201cwe need to leave\u201d and he ignored me because he has to sleep I would leave. Not just leave the house, leave him.", "Yta, unless he claims everything is an emergency, you needed to get up and get out when he's telling you its an emergency and you both need to leave.", "I think AH.

And then wait an hour.\n\nIn an emergency you'd go up and get them. Immediately. Emergently, even.\n\nSo it clearly isn't an emergency, he's having feelings. It's probably tough for him being back in such a toxic environment, but that doesn't mean the right answer is waking someone up in the middle of the night who has to be up early for work. \n\nThe answer is to let them know in the AM that he can't do this anymore, that he'll pack their stuff up and take it to an extended stay while the other person goes to work. \n\nNTA", "If it\u2019s truly an emergency, then he would\u2019ve started packing stuff to leave.

There are not a lot of emergencies that require waking your children in the middle of the night to evacuate. \n\nThe only kind of emergency that would require drastic measures like that would be the life-threatening kind. Fire, threats of violence. \n\nIn that case, you don't send a message first. You grab you children and run. \n\nThe fact in itself that OP's husband didn't do that shows that it clearly wasn't the kind of emergency she needed to take that seriously. \n\nFurther illustrated by the fact that her husband refused to tell her what it had been about. If he thinks that it's so urgent that they leave, then he needs to tell her why. The fact that he can afford to give her the silent treatment obviously means it's not that bad.", "What if it's the usual discussion between him and his father and she burns a sick day over that?
