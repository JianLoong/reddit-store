Wait until the morning, and let you know that he was finding another solution to your living situation or if he really couldn't handle staying there one more night, wake you up enough to let you know whats going on then leave for the night.   \n\nI can't understand all these Y T A comments.", "NTA", "Info: what was the emergency?

In order to do that, you need to be alert and pay attention.  If you are like me, you can't do that when you are half asleep.

An emergency doesn't have time for a conversation. It does kinda suck that you weren't able to listen to him or he won't talk now.\n\nMaybe go out for brunch or something with just him and explain to him that you were out of it last night.
