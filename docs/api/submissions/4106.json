We've done many stupid things together in the past that have mostly brought us closer together. \n\nWe recently had our last day of school classes (muck-up day). He'd been brainstorming for a while about what our muck-up day prank should be, but I kept telling him I wasn't really keen on doing one at all because I was pretty focused on exams and didn't want to get in trouble. \n\nI talked him out of a couple terrible ideas before he came up with the idea that he stuck to. His prank idea was for us to wait until halfway through our last class together, stand up at our desks, strip completely naked, walk to each other's desk, put the other person's clothes on and sit back down as if nothing had happened.\n\nWhile I have to admit that I thought it was a pretty funny idea, I am a pretty introverted person and this plan terrified me. I told him I wasn't sure and that I probably won't be game to do it. He has this way of just kinda telling me what to do and persisting until I eventually do it, which is what he tried here. But this was pretty far out of my wheelhouse.\n\nSo all week in the lead up to muck-up day he was telling me exactly how it was going to unfold and what I had to do. Our seats are pretty much on opposite ends of the classroom (he's front left and I'm back middle) so we'd have to walk quite some distance. \n\nRight before the class he asks me if I'm good to go, to which I reply (word for word) \"I don't think I'm going to do it dude. Just sounds way too embarrassing\". He just laughed and told me I'd better not pussy out, which annoyed me because I'm 99% sure I never actually agreed to it in the first place. I didn't say anything back to him after that. \n\nAnyway the clock ticks over to half past and much to my surprise he actually stands up at his desk at the front of the room and starts unbuttoning his shirt. I panicked as soon as he got up wondering if I should do the same. I didn't move a muscle though, because I was way too terrified (and distracted by the show he was putting on).\n\nBy the time I'd snapped back into it he had stepped out of his pants and his briefs and turned towards me in just his shoes before realising I was still sitting at my desk. He said \"really dude?\" and covered himself with his hands before turning around and getting dressed again while the rest of the class was laughing and making catcalls.\n\nHe got sent home early that day and missed a bunch of farewell stuff. Later he started to text me about how I was a shitty friend and how I let him down. He reckons I led him to believe that I was going to do it with him all the way up until the end, but I only ever said things like \"I don't know about it\" or \"I probably won't do that\".\n\nI really don't think I'm the asshole but it's been weeks now and he's still mad at me over it.

Priceless.", "NTA. You didn't agree to it and he seems like a shitty friend if he just assumed he'd pressure you into it.\n\nAnd what did he expect would happen when he stripped down? The school was obviously going to punish him", "NTA. You never said yes, & right before class you plainly told him you weren't going to do it. His embarrassment is his own problem, although he also seems to struggle with the concept of consent, since he assumed he could just bully you into doing what he wanted despite your saying no.", "NTA. Tell him that your prank was to spoil his prank - as he's such a hilarious dude he'll find that extremely funny!", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even risk a stunt like this in school for fear of sexual offender/exposure  charges. It literally takes one person to report that this harmed them in some way and boom, all future prospects ruined. \n\nAlso how naked is naked? Like did this guy have his cock out in the middle of class?", "NTA. He didn't listen to you, so it's his fault.  But you also should have said more strongly NO.", "I'd love to be this age again and this was the biggest problem in my life ffs. NTA it was obviously a stupid plan and he needs to grow up", "NTA, probably you should had been more direct at stating you were not going to do it, but as far at it seems you did express your discomfort and your unwillingness to participate in any prank", "NTA. I don't find this prank funny, but that's probably because I know what kind of criminal charges can come from it. Even if you said you would participate (which you didnt) doesn't mean you can't change your mind. To be honest you might want to reevaluate your friendship with him since he pressures you into doing things you're uncomfortable with.", "NTA You told him that you won't do it but he didn't wanted to hear it. And this was a shitty idea. It wasn't even funny. You are adults. You don't can strip down naked infront of people. \n\nAnd somehow when reading this i found especially disgusting.. His plan was you switch clothes. He take off his underwear that he wore for half the day and then you walk to his place and put the still warm underwear from him on. Ugh. A new friendship level...", "LOL you accidentally pulled the best muck-up day prank ever, NTA", "NTA ~~YTA~~ for not telling your friend you would not go through with it?  Getting 100% naked in class halfway through the day is 1) illegal in the US 2) 100% sure to get your banned for the rest of the day of school.\n\nYour friend is an A H for thinking this was a good idea AT ALL.\n\nI re-read your submission and saw where you said you prolly weren't going to do it.

A bad friend is someone who tries to force you to do it for their own amusement.", "Maybe you could have been clearer and more consistent about not doing this with him. It probably would have been wise at some point to make it clear that you absolutely weren\u2019t doing this and that if he started to do this, he was on his own. That said, you\u2019re still not the asshole. But really it\u2019s an idea you shouldn\u2019t even have really entertained to begin with. It may have slightly misled him for him to think you were on the fence when this was really a hard no from the beginning.", "NTA for what you ask but you are the AH for not communicating clearly. Learn to say \"no\", it\u00b4s a perfectly good response.  \"No\" clearly, instead of \"maybe no\", \"i don\u00b4t think\" \"i don\u00b4t know\" \"probably not\"", "We had talked about it a few days before. He reckons he'd heard stories of people doing even more messed up stuff and not getting punished because it was a muck-up. I told him all along we'd end up in trouble though", "I don't even think he's embarrassed really. More just mad at me because in his eyes I didn't follow through with a promise", "Naked as the day he was born. And that's what I said to him as well - the day before he was telling me about it and I said I was pretty sure we could get in actual trouble for it. I don't think he has though", "This way you end up on the s3x offender list  he needs  his head checked.  \n\nAlso  you never said ok ,you said it's  not something  you  want to do as such nta  at all.", "If this is what he ended up with, I wonder wtf the terrible ideas were.  You don\u2019t have to answer though, I don\u2019t mean to put you on the spot.", "If he had left his underwear on he'd probably be a lot better off.", "But you *didn't* promise, so he has no justification for being mad at you. There's a really major difference between you actually promising to do something & you telling someone you aren't going to do that thing, but they just assume they can bludgeon you into it anyway.", "Yeah that's what I thought too. I'm pretty sure the only reason he feels that way is because in the past I've always been a bit of a yes man when he had stupid ideas. Just this one was a bit too far for me"]}
