You literally admit that the reason you bought your son a car is laziness. And then the next sentence, explain you told your daughters to make friends with people who have a car? Idk how to paint the irony more clearly....", "So, your current husband doesn't have any paternal feelings for children who are not a biological child, even though, presumable, from the ages when you married, they were quite young?

Did your ex not pay child support? \n\nIt sounds like your son has been treated differently since he is from your current marriage and your daughter is right, that is not fair. If the girls had to work for driving lessons and work for a car or find rides then it should be the same for your son. There is no reason to treat him differently.", "YTA for not even noticing or seeming to care that you are playing favorites.

If you have the money help them", "As someone with siblings constantly getting bailed out by parents\u2026YTA. \n\nYou need to treat your kids equally, which you\u2019re not doing.

If you search deep down do you feel that you favor the younger child?  It's your money, but if you don't want to be scratching your head over why your daughters never talk to you, you should think about how you treat them all, how your husband treats them all and what to do about any favoritism you discover.  \n\n\nre-read this and realized that your current husband and you have been together for 18 years???  that really seems like flat out favoritism.  if you're reaching out to the internet for advice, here it is:  fix your relationship with your daughters, don't let your husband cause you to neglect the children that aren't his, or prepare for only hearing about how those grandchildren are doing from other family members.", "YTA.

Even though you\u2019re in a better financial position now, you should have had a conversation with your girls explaining this.

My spouse still feels mild resentment 20+ years toward his parent for treating his step sister and sister differently regarding the issue of a car.  It\u2019s not the only way he has been treated differently over the years.  \n\nHe sees it and it definitely affects their relationship.", "Yta and showing clear signs of favoritism towards your son. The only way to settle this is to give each of them 3-4k towards a car for them or to help them pay for a car they have now so it\u2019ll be fair.

YTA big time", "YTA after my dad died, my mom bought new cars for her and my siblings, She had no intention of getting me car but when my partner asked she said I could sell my brothers old car ( she reneged on this). Tbh, this broke our relationship, She was always a homophobe but this made our relationship clear.\n\nTo add to this, I had to buy her a car this year cause now she is broke.

And $6,000 isn\u2019t a lot on cars now. When I was 16, $6,000 would get you a pretty nice used car. Plenty of my friends bought beaters for under $2K and I was lucky enough to score a Mitsubishi eclipse for $1,200 and drive it for a solid 4 years before the engine blew on my way to a gig. I recently had to go car shopping and was absolutely shocked at how expensive used cars were on this current day and age since the last car I bought outright was over 10 years ago.  \n\nYour son isn\u2019t driving around in something super nice. Probably just enough to get him around.\n\nYour daughters aren\u2019t assholes though for feeling like they were slighted. It\u2019s easy to be jealous of the world around us. I felt that way a lot because I grew up with a sister to a single mom because my dad died when I was a toddler. I cannot begin to explain all the circumstances that felt like our mom was treating us less than our friends parents treated them. But we\u2019ve since grown up and our mom has more available resources to help us when she can now and dote on her first granddaughter, my niece. \n\nDo something nice for your daughters and let them know you\u2019ll be there to help them if they ever need it.

What about helping with any student loans?  Contribute towards a down payment on a house?  Start a college fund for any future children?  I mean, sure financial circumstances change and it's quite possible that the money was there for a car now that wasn't 6 years ago.

In fact, I'd have expected to read about all the ways she helped out other than financially, but no, just advice to make friends.", "Nah, you just assumed OP paid for their college based on zero information.\n\nIt's possible OP did pay. It's also possible that the daughters paid their own way.
