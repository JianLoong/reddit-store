Period. No person is better than another because of their job. If your parents often left her in charge of her 4 younger siblings then she was absolutely parentified. Your sister is normal. She has different interests than you, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s 2023 - the world is changing.

How do you come to the conclusion that she's \"trying to make herself look special\" by saying she's bisexual?   Isn't that about attraction?  Why would she lie about this?  And why do you doubt she has an eating disorder?\n\nAnd most of all, in your post you wrote and I quote: \"**My parents thought she was the responsible one and left me and our four younger sisters in her care often**.\"\n\nThen you wrote and again I quote: \" For example she apparently has an eating disorder (she's overweight after an \"epilepsy diet\"), and **she was parentified**.\"\n\nYou literally confirmed this above (see the 2 areas I boldened for comparison).  \n\nYour parents often left 5 younger kids in her care?  That IS IN FACT parentification. I can see why it might not feel to good to be considered a source of trauma and abuse for her, but would you REALLY have wanted to have the responsibility that was on her shoulders when your parents often left 5 kids in her care?  It's really a good thing that your parents aren't arguing and trying to rug sweep what they did. \n\nJust so you know, some manual jobs pay pretty well.  You seem to THINK your parents are paying for her a lot, but what do you base that on?\n\nI don't believe I want to call you an AH.  You seem jealous of your sister and hurt by her comment about you being a source of trauma and abuse. \n\nI do however think you need to reassess the situation and come to realize a lot of your assumptions about her lying all these different things might be wrong.  And it's kind of hurtful for you to express the sentiment that \"we stopped getting on since she liked more boyish stuff and wouldn't be normal\"\n\nShe is who she is.

You need to educate yourself, frankly - your comments on neurodiversity are concerning.", "YTA\n\nI don't know whether you parents favoured her or not but the reasons you give for disliking her sound pretty toxic, judgmental and seem to come from jealousy.\n\nYou do not have proof she is lying about any medical condition. Autism is not diagnosed based on the answers a person gives on a test it requires multiple appointments and observations. You take everything good your sister has done and attempt to twist it to seem like proof she is a bad person and to top it off speak about being bi-sexual, gender fluid and neurodivergent etc.  as being abnormal when these are very real and very normal things.\n\nI think you are feeling uninteresting, inadequate and jealous. These feelings are valid because all feelings are valid but you need to get to the bottom of why you are feeling this way instead of being bitter about your sister.\n\nBeing bitter is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. This will not lead to anything other than pain for you. OP you should seek therapy to improve your own life, focus on yourself and what you want out of life. I wish you luck.", "YTA.\n\nYou have deep issues with you parents. By your own account, they were never much in your life and left you under the care of your sister. Anger is a common reaction when we feel hurt. To me, you seem like you're expressing hurt towards your parents for never giving you the love and attention every child should get.\n\nHowever, your sister isn't your punching bag and has no influence on how your parents are acting - as you see, THEY are the ADULTS, not HER. The amount of contempt you speak with towards your sister makes me believe that you'll never mend that relationship and that your sister may have a point that you're a source of great deal of trauma. It seems to me that you have been gaslighting her and the people around her to think that she's making her medical history up.\n\nIt is a good idea to explore that trauma so it doesn't drag itself around every other relationship you end up having in your adulthood. You seem to not want to ask your parents for help since they are the real target of this misplaced anger and thus, you would only listen to their advice \"if they pay for it\" - I'm not sure if you're looking for monetary gains with this statement. You should find a safe space to explore your emotions and articulate an appropriate response to this situation. Therapy that involves your family might be a good starting point.", ">Eg, epilepsy, autism (recent, you can like on that test),\n\nIt's not like they just ask you a couple questions and diagnose you (it doesn't work that way for ANY disorder) there is a set of criteria you must meet to be diagnosed. And usually you need to meet a certain amount in order to be diagnosed. Enough so that you can't fake it. They look at verbal cues (repetitive words, reaction to environment, repetitive stuff, etc.) So clearly you know nothing about that so don't go around telling people she is faking or lying. You aren't her doctor. \n\n>She also does things to make herself look good like donating and volunteering.\n\nGood for her. She's giving back to the community. Are you? \n\n>For example she apparently has an eating disorder (she's overweight after an \"epilepsy diet\"),\n\nYou can be overweight with an eating disorder. It's common. It's not just skinny people. It's people of all types. So again ignorance. \n\n>she was parentified. Last week she said I was a source of trauma and abuse for her.\n\nMaybe you are. It's that way for a lot of parentified kids. They resent their younger siblings for having to basically raise them. It doesn't make her a bad person. \n\n>we stopped getting on since she liked more boyish stuff and wouldn't be normal.\n\nSince WHEN is tomboy not normal? What even is this sentence. First you say it's because she's attention seeking. Then it changes to \"cause she's into boy stuff and that's not normal\" what. \n\n>don't think I'm in the wrong for wanting a normal sister and a normal family\n\nAnd there it is. You don't like any of her diagnoses because they're WEIRD and UNNATURAL and you're \"so normal\" newsflash. Nobody's normal and you're AH for this comment. It's the whole reason you shadowed this post. The truth is hidden with these other false lies \"cause she's attention seeking but also she lied on that test\" and then you say \"want a normal family\" one without mental illness. Yeah. YTA. Big time.", "Her medical information doesn't feel like it has any relevance here. Illness doesn't care if you believe in it or not.\n\nYou accuse her of doing charity work to make herself look good, but you don't back up your claims on this at all. It sounds like you are just an asshole.\n\nFor all we know, you really were a source of stress for her, especially since your general attitude and sentiment here comes off as awfully shitty. Parentifaction is a very real problem in some households.\n\nYou accused her of not being \"normal\" because she liked \"boyish\" things, that just sounds like a super toxic opinion to me. \n\nYou're even having a go at your younger sister here. If you intent was to garner sympathy from this sub, you've done a terrible job at it. \n\nYTA", "YTA, you sound jealous, and bitter. \u201cShe also does things to make herself look good like donating and volunteering.\u201d Seriously? The average person rarely donates to charity and volunteers just to look good. Also, what proof do you have that she\u2019s faking any of her conditions? A lot of those conditions, specifically autism, ADHD, and PCOS, are often missed in women until later in life. I think the thing that really solidified the YTA verdict for you was your whole tangent on wanting you sister to be \u201cnormal\u201d and claiming that she\u2019s just trying to \u201cmake herself special\u201d with her sexuality and gender identity. Oh, and by the way, neurodivergent is a common term used to describe people whose brains develop and work differently for a number of reasons, you might benefit from doing some research before prattling on with your ableism.\n\nETA: I think it\u2019s worth noting that I have a degree in Neuroscience and Psychology, with a focus on neurobiology and neuropsychological disorders. From what I\u2019ve seen, most of the issue here is that you have a fundamental misunderstanding on what neurodivergent conditions are like. Based on your comments, you seem ignorant to how a lot of these conditions are diagnosed in women as they present differently in women and are harder to diagnose/easier to miss. You seem to treat these conditions like they\u2019re cosmetic issues due to sensitivity when in reality they are serious health concerns that can have a major impact on a person\u2019s health and well-being.", "YTA but I see from your followup comments there's absolutely no chance that you're going to think about anything anyone has said here. \n\nI do hope you seek counseling.", "YTA\n\n>my older sister (28) has medical stuff that she keeps adding to, I think she is lying for most of them.\n\nUnless you are a doctor - and more specifically, HER doctor - it's not your place to decry that she's lying.  The thing about autoimmune illnesses is that if you have one, you typically end up having several.  \n\n>She also does things to make herself look good like donating and volunteering\n\nOh no, she also does charity work to help others?

Your parents apparently agree that they had her practically mother you and/or your siblings - and you're repaying that kindness by giving her shit at every turn.\n\n>My parents have changed their habits to accommodate for my younger sister's apparent sensory issues which she is making up because she's lazy.\n\nYour family is right - You need counseling and SOON.  Contrary to what you believe, the entire world is not against you.", "YTA (currently). It sounds to me like you have grown up in a household with a lot of complex medical and emotional needs and you feel that your needs were often pushed aside in favor of you siblings (especially your sister). These feelings are common for siblings of people with disabilities and while it is understandable that you might feel some resentment you still have a choice in how you deal with it. Saying your sister is faking her issues, feeling jealous when she tries to do good and making unproven accusations against her is NOT going to improve your situation or change your family. \n\nOn the other hand, having therapy may help you to process your difficult childhood and to learn communicate more open and effectively with your family. You wouldn\u2019t be doing it for your sister/parents but so you get the support YOU need. You can stay angry and hostile or learn how to deal with and move past your own and your family\u2019s failings - up to you.", "YTA\nWhy do you think she's lying about everything??

There is also a higher risk of epilepsy if you are autistic. PCOS is also fairly common, although I don't know about a correlation between being neurodivergent and having PCOS.\n\nThere is also a correlation between being neurodivergent and being LGBTQIA+ or having eating disorders.\n\nNone of your sisters' claims are outlandish.\n\nThe rest of your post reads like a jealous teen suffering from a bad case of BEC.\n\nI suggest you educate yourself because the amount of ableism and bigotry in your post is immense.", "YTA and you sound like the most self centered ignorant person I have seen on here in a while but sure go in life thinking whenever anyone does anything its to look better then you.", "YTA - you're doubting her diagnosed medical issues?

That's just ridiculous.", "OP you are ignorant. Wow. You don\u2019t just grow out of mental health conditions that you\u2019re predispositioned to.

And they had to remove her ovary at that time. 28 is definitely not too young to have PCOS.\n\nAs for ADHD and Autism, women are more likely to be diagnosed as adults. I'm 29 and I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. The symptoms were there since I was a child, but since I didn't have the hyperactivity and got good grades (due to anxiety), no one paid any attention to it. It's definitely not something people grow out of and I think it's even gotten worse as I've gotten older. \n\nNeurodivergency is a real thing and it can already feel isolating and painful enough experiencing it without having others doubting it and telling them to \"just get over it and try harder\". There is no such thing as a normal family or a normal person.

I'd suggest doing some research on her diagnoses and try to get a better idea of what she's going through. Then when you feel you can have more of an open mind, try having a conversation with her, allowing her to talk about her own experiences and what she's going through. Once she's done, you can share what it's been like from your perspective. Having a sibling get all the attention isn't easy.

I think you might become better at managing adhd given the right support, but it is definitely a lifelong diagnosis for the majority of people.  And no, you don\u2019t suddenly become autistic or adhd as an adult, but women are often misdiagnosed or missed entirely until their adult years.

But it is very often not diagnosed in childhood, specially in women since most symptoms are internalized. My mild to moderate ADHD was diagnosed when I was 34y old. Looking back I can see exactly the signs now that I know what to look for but for the longest time I just thought I was awful, lazy and couldn't \"be normal\" as you wished she was. Lemme tell you she probably wished it too. \n\nI have diagnosed PCOS since I was 18y old. I know a lot of people with similar diagnosis. So you're also wrong there.\n\nBut you know. Me and all the medical professionals who diagnosed me are probably wrong and I'm lying for attention too. \n\nYTA. \n\nMaybe she's exaggerating. Maybe she is going a bit too far on all the medical conditions. But considering this is your \"gotcha\" reasoning? I'm not really inclined to believe you for everything else either.", "You cannot grow out of ADHD or autism. You might get better at managing them, but you don't grow out of them. \n\nAnd no, they don't turn up suddenly as an adult, but a lot of people with certain types of ADHD and autism have been historically underdiagnosed during childhood - especially girls, because they often present different symptoms (thought to be at least partially due to societal expectations being gendered). As a result, because they haven't had support to develop coping skills during childhood, they can accrue ongoing difficulties through the rest of their life until they get a belated diagnosis and start getting the help they've needed.\n\nAlso, too young to have PCOS?! Is she a prepubescent? Because if not - and it sounded to me like you were describing an adult - then no she isn't too young. PCOS affects teenage and women throughout their fertile life (and into menopause), and often develops from the moment they hit puberty. And no, it isn't rare.

Mandarins have a strong scent and while I think it\u2019s personally nice, it\u2019s probably very overwhelming for them. Just eat them in another room it\u2019s not hard to do.

One of your sisters doesn\u2019t like to do the dishes so Kim does it instead, Kim hates vacuuming so you do it, sharing chores like that is just a thing people do. In my house, where everyone is neurotypical, we divide tasks up like that too. My brother used to detest cooking so he would clean the kitchen after we made a meal, I hate mopping but I\u2019m a pro at organizing and cleaning our fridge. As for the mandarin thing, is that really so hard to accommodate? I get that it might not be a big deal to you, and that it might be inconvenient at times, but it would make a world of difference to your sister.
