If she wants to stay there, she'll have to deal with the noise.\n\nIt's not reasonable to block off a room and prevent you from enjoying your day off when she has an office.", "NTA\n\nYou each have your own office to work in. She prefers working in the living room, but that preference to work there when she has a dedicated workspace elsewhere in the house shouldn't trump your use of the shared living room to have lunch or relax in on your time/day off.\n\nShe's an ahole for wanting to lay a claim to a shared space for her sole use, preventing you from using it.\n\nHave you asked her why she prefers the living room to work in? Is her office tiny? Does the living room have a bigger desk/better chair? Does she sometimes hear noise from neighbours in her office but not in the living room? If you can nail down her issues with her own office, maybe you can both work on making her home office a nicer place for her to work than the living room. If it turns out she just likes the larger space of the living room, well then, though luck, but that's no reason to bar someone else from using that shared space. Or she needs to be willing to give up her office altogether and you can make a game room in there?", "NTA and it's weird she's making a scene for a single, isolated day. I'd be on her side if she didn't have a good space to work and you were trying to put your \"free day\" above her work, but it's clearly not the case so what gives???", "NTA. There's no point in designating a room as an office if it isn't going to be used as one.", "NTA \nShe\u2019s not being reasonable. It\u2019s one day and even if it wasn\u2019t she has a home office. The living room can be her default if there is no other use but if you\u2019re at home then she needs to be in her office. \n\nIs she usually this unreasonable or could there be something behind it - perhaps feeling like the allocation of offices was unfair?", ">She got annoyed and accused me of not thinking about her work and putting a video game above her work\n\nYes, you are. And it's in your original agreement. NTA.", "NTA - She has an office and a home office. The living room is communal space. \n\nIf she is normally a rational human, than there has to be something more going on here. Hold your ground on using the living room, but try to dig a bit deeper about what is going on here. If she is just being selfish, not sure how you move forward from that.", "NTA, why doesn't she want to work in the office, why is she insisting on working in the living room. Take your day, enjoy your game.", "NTA\n\nYou have yourself a selfish, entitled GF.  Dump her.", "NTA, what absolute nonsense this is.... She has an office and that's where the work supposed to happen. Why on earth would you stay out of your own living room???", "NTA. Your partner is being self and self-centred.", "NTA\n\nI work from home and wouldn't dream of using the living room, I am set up in the spare room as a home office.\n\nStick to your guns, get the game and play, she will soon move.\n\nLiving room should not be used for work unless there is no other space.", "NTA she has her own office to use", "Turn her office into your game room", "NTA on the face of it, but it sounds like there is a back story here.

Can you move the TV into your office?", "NTA, you had an agreement over your shared space.\nWhy don't you bring the gaming hardware to your office space?\nOr ... turn her \"former\" office into a gaming room?

From the description and the OP's replies, she has her own space. She just likes using the living room.\n\nHonestly, maybe you should consider turning her office space into the family gaming area. That way, she has her preferred space and the other room gets some use.", "NTA. She has an office and should use it.", "Nta she should be using her home office. Honestly If she doesn't want to use her office I would give her a choice 1. move her office to the living room and use her office as a hangout/game room, with Comfy seating, tv, game system, mini fridge. Or 2 she can use her office like she should and allow the living area a work free zone.", "NTA. She's being quite unreasonable as she has an office just for that. There's nothing wrong with just putting yourself on the couch and firing the game up. You've let her know you'll be using the living room for living, and she has a more appropriate room for her activities.", "NTA. She has perfectly reasonable options, she needs to vacate the living room.", "NTA.", "NTA. She has an office. Use it", "Tell her she can have the living room, and all the bills, and solitude she wants because you can't be in a relationship with someone who backs out on agreements when it suits her.

She needs to work in the office or her home office daily, rather than hogging the living room. \n\nYou need to wear noise canceling headphones when gaming.", "NTA. The living room is shared space so she can't take it over or decide that you can't also use it.

Transfer her office in the living room and then make the office your living room", "NTA She is being REALLY unreasonable. She should be able to use her home office for one day, it won't kill her.", "NTA. She has an office. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for\u2026working. She just doesn\u2019t want to move, but trying to pull the my work outranks your dumb game, when really this is about you relaxing and doing some self-care. So put it in terms of that. \n\nIf she wants to use the living room as an office in addition to her actual office, perhaps she should pay more towards your rent or mortgage. Hardly seems fair that you cannot use the COMMON AREA if your home when you\u2019re at home.", "Nothing she just prefers the living room", "Right? The GF could be just totally unreasonable, but I wonder what the office really is. Is this a 3+ bedroom apartment or is her \u201coffice\u201d actually a closet or something that\u2019s not comfortable to be in for the whole day?", "Plus a freakin' office at work.", "I'd bet a nickel that she finds video games childish and can't believe a grown man wastes his time doing that, and this is a passive-aggressive move to keep him from wasting his time.\n\nA friend of mine has had almost this exact situation happen, and it eventually came out that his wife absolutely hated that he gamed.", ">perhaps feeling like the allocation of offices was unfair?\n\nShe got the more spacious office so that isn't the problem", "Same here.  Once I'm done, I walk out of my office and don't think about work anymore until the next day.  I prefer the separation.", "We haven't had other arguments abotu gaming or work.

How is HE a jerk?", "How do you think I have communicated badly exactly? I gave my gf plenty of notice of my plans", "That's really selfish of her. You aren't telling her she can never use the living room for work. You're simply asking for 1 day when you are on leave. She can use her da\\*\\* office that day or go to her workplace.\n\nShe literally has no reason.", "I WFH. I have a home office area but I also prefer the living room (windows!). But if my partner wants to use the living room then I either deal with whatever they're doing or work in my office space or bedroom. If she really wants to work in the living room, there's no reason she can't put on headphones while you game and ignore you. Unless she has calls she needs to talk on, then the office space is usually better for that anyway.", "And I prefer to sip pina coladas in the Caribbean; we don't always get everything we want. Being part of a couple means sometimes the other person's wishes come first.", "It's a 3 bedroom apartment, my gfs office is the second biggest bedroom and she has no problems with the chair or anything in the room", "Then you need use the hell out of the the living room!!!", "She\u2019s being so selfish, I would literally wake up and choose chaos. Be in the living room playing the game before she starts work.", "Same. The windows and higher ceilings in the living room make for a much more comfortable space than my office (and my office is nice!). But if my partner is about and wants to watch tv or just be in the house, I know I have to go to my office bc it would be unfair and selfish of me to limit his access to a shared space or to make him feel like he\u2019s got to be on egg shells. \n\nTo be fair, he\u2019s also extra considerate when I\u2019m in my office bc noise travels and I can be distracted easily. He\u2019s considerate of me, we\u2019re a partnership, so we accommodate.", "Definitely NTA then. Her behavior doesn\u2019t make any sense.", "Perhaps you can try to work with her and see if there\u2019s anything you guys can do to make the space more comfortable for her. \n\nSome of us are very particular about space, it could be a nice gesture?", "Turn up the volume of the game.  I\u2019m petty.  I know."]}
