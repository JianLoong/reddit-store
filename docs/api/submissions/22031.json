That's insulting and now you are standing your ground.

Oddly enough, due to there not being a magic money tree, things didn't go to her liking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOver time though, due to her incessant nagging, a lot of my stuff got moved, removed, sold etc. Even things that weren't out on display or even visible had to go.

She just wanted it gone \"because\"...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe ... by which I mean she ... wanted to change sofas. We spent weeks driving around looking at new ones, something I couldn't really afford truth be told, until she picked a style and colour. Placed the order. They're built to order over here and once you order you can't change your mind, there's no return piolicy (unless it arrives broken or damaged etc). New sofa, the style and colour o which *she'd* picked arrived. As it was still being uploaded by the delivery crew she was screwing her nose up and whinged for days that she didn't like it, wanted to return it (And just couldn't understand why we couldn't) and then wanted to sell it and replace it with some other choice she'd made that was proper flouncy, garish, Barbie-esq girly. Needless to say that didn't happen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBasically she made it clear that any element of me, mine, my past in terms of furniture, decor, style, accoutrements weren't \"her\" thing and thus must go.

Interesting!\". It's just ... painfully shit. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I live in my own place, the decor isn't manly or girly, it just \"is\".
