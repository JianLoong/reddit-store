I\u2019m a woman, a gamer one, and you both have right to pick your furniture and have personal spaces if you can afford it. It\u2019s not only her house.", "NTA\n\nAnd the fact she brought her friends in on this is even worse", "NTA, the whole its HER house and she should be able to decorate completely disregards that you are a part of that house hold. It is important for you both to have spaces to decorate and then have communal spaces with compromised furnishings. That being said, I would make yourself a dedicated workspace/office. This should not be in a communal area where guests have access to it.", "NTA. I overall think that trying to split decisions 50/50 is a silly approach instead of communicating and compromising about your overall style and making decisions together, but from what you describe your wife has made that kind of communication impossible. Just removing your stuff with no discussion is unacceptable.\n\nShe\u2019s fallen into sexist stereotypes, encouraged by her friends, that men don\u2019t care about their homes and don\u2019t need any say in how they\u2019re decorated.\n\nBut don\u2019t have any kids until the two of you actually resolve this in a healthy way and have good communication. The pettiness needs to end.", "NTA. I love how she has a right to decorate her home how she sees fit, but you live there too.   I do go though similar.  I conceded to letting wife do our house up how she wanted because frankly arguing about what I like and wanted was exhausting. But, I have my little things like I hung up a framed poster for one of my favorite movies, I have the A/V setup the way I want, I have my gaming rig setup in our room and my side of the room has all my bikes etc. When we went to buy all new appliances, I picked them out based on the colors and styles I wanted...so you just have to pick your battles..", "NTA - This is your house too, me and my ex moved in together some years ago and being made to feel like a guest/after thought in your own house is fucking horrible", "NTA! You have a right to want your decor and have interests that she may not agree with. It's your home too. Why are her friends even having a say about what goes on in your home, with your wife? Your wife can decorate, but so can you, she needs to get over herself. You're NTA here!", "NTA. The house has to be for both of you. Decorating  house, choosing furniture, should be done together unless one of you REALLY does not care. In my experience as a female visual artist, men do have points of view about how a house should look\u2014how it should feel to them\u2014and it's petty to diminish that. Husband and I started out broke and have gone to second hand stores to pick put furniture throughout our marriage\u2014still do. It has been fun, and our tastes have developed together over the years. I could tell you exactly what he would like and what would drive him crazy if I brought it home, and he could do the same for me. This should not be a point of contention between you and your wife, but she has made it one by lobbying against you with her friends. In front of you. That's insulting and now you are standing your ground. But see if you can get past it at some point\u2014go shopping with her, agree to buy nothing that you don't both really really like, and see how that goes. She might find she likes some of what you like\u2014and vice versa. Except not the Live Laugh Love sign and anything that smells. I'd counter those with a straight up stuffed deer's head if I were you, and I am not a hunter!", "If my wife made unilateral decisions on how the whole house would be decorated, I'd be happily single again.  Fortunately, we talk through things like adults.  In the previous house, we did one room at a time, and found something that worked for both of us.  Same  with this house, too.  We were fortunate to have 2 weeks after closing before our stuff could arrive (Thanks Covid), and did a ton of painting, fixing up, and other cosmetic changes that we both liked without  having crap in the way. I just like telling that story.\n\nAnyway, NTA.  Wife is controlling.  Her friends can STFU and mind their own business.", "I\u2018m a woman and married and I would always ask my husband if we can change something in our flat - like he would do too - because we both live her, so we both have to like it. And if we disagree we talk about it and come to a solution that works for both of us. \nAnd it\u2018s not that you would lock her away, with having a whole room for herself, she can use all the rooms, just not change them to her hearts content. \n\nSo NTA.\nEven Though the 50/50 Solution sounds strange. If you like some things she put up, it doesn\u2019t have to be 50/50. And I mean about what type of \u201estuff\u201c are we talking? Furniture? Dekoration? Collections of books/movies/games? \nAnd even if it is some special stuff you have, like spider collections, deepsea decoration or whatever, I suppose she married you, knowing who you are and what stuff you have. \n\nMaybe ask her what she dislikes about your stuff and why she\u2018s putting everything away?", "ESH. A territorial war? This is just bonkers. Can't you two just have a normal conversation? Tell your wife what bits you like, what changes you'd like to see? Jumping to 'now I'm 100% in charge' is just combative. If you honestly can't communicate with each other, you need therapy, not interior design.", "NTA.  You have the right to have a say in how your home is furnished.  I am a woman and my husband and I disagree about certain things, but I never dismiss his input.\n\nHowever, having said that, I would not allow a desk and computer in the lounge, i.e. family room, common area, etc.  That is what spare bedrooms are for, especially if it is a work computer.", "NTA and this exactly why I won't get married. I won't give up the power to not have a gaming station in my living room, especially under the threat of \"or I'll simply take it from you in court.\"", "ESH. You guys need counseling. Your territorial war is slowly destroying your marriage.", "ESH, you're both being silly and petty instead of working together. \n\nwhat kinds of things of yours have been removed or replaced? \n\nwhen you bought the home, did you two not talk about how you wanted to decorate it?\n\ndo you not have a home office, since you're a remote worker? wouldn't that be enough for your gaming setup?", "INFO: so the computer in the lounge is both used for gaming, AND used for you doing your work 6 days a week/say 8 hours of work a day?\n\nI don't think the the gaming is the issue, the using the shared lounge as an office 6 days a week might be if you have other options.", "Kinda YTA. You can\u2019t say that the decisions are 100% yours until you get to 50/50. Why not go 50/50 right now? Also, if you have a spare room, why not use that as your office if you work from home? You\u2019d have your own space and more privacy when your wife isn\u2019t working during the summers.", "If I didn\u2019t have kids I\u2019d fight with my wife about shit like this too.  ESH. I hope you both work it out asap.  Life is short. Give and take baby, give and take.  What the point of scorching the earth with your spouse? Ya know?

But there should be a meeting of minds to decide how common areas are decorated.", "ESH- yall need counseling", "NTA. And thank you for giving us \u201cgirl grotto.\u201d", "My ex and I (Ex for a different reason than this!) moved in together. She had very little in way of furniture, bric-a-brac, \"stuff\". So it was mostly my things and admittedly, it was very manly. Initially she was fine with this ... until she was not. Suddenly expected this budget to just appear out of thin air to refurnish everything. Oddly enough, due to there not being a magic money tree, things didn't go to her liking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOver time though, due to her incessant nagging, a lot of my stuff got moved, removed, sold etc. Even things that weren't out on display or even visible had to go. I used to have a VAST music collection - most of it went to a 2nd hand seller even though it was stored under a bed in a place that she neither needed nor went. She just wanted it gone \"because\"...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe ... by which I mean she ... wanted to change sofas. We spent weeks driving around looking at new ones, something I couldn't really afford truth be told, until she picked a style and colour. Placed the order. They're built to order over here and once you order you can't change your mind, there's no return piolicy (unless it arrives broken or damaged etc). New sofa, the style and colour o which *she'd* picked arrived. As it was still being uploaded by the delivery crew she was screwing her nose up and whinged for days that she didn't like it, wanted to return it (And just couldn't understand why we couldn't) and then wanted to sell it and replace it with some other choice she'd made that was proper flouncy, garish, Barbie-esq girly. Needless to say that didn't happen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBasically she made it clear that any element of me, mine, my past in terms of furniture, decor, style, accoutrements weren't \"her\" thing and thus must go. Thing is ... her own style of decor etc is ... to put it mildly, \"Ikea + fucking hideous garish weird shit\" but not in even a \"Ooo, kooky, signiture pieces and then minimalist other bits! Interesting!\". It's just ... painfully shit. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I live in my own place, the decor isn't manly or girly, it just \"is\". It's minimalist in away with a couple of geek pieces (Like, literally 1 or 2). I decided long ago that the next person I'm serious about and decide to keep around needs to understand that I will never be dicated too again. Decisions are to be mutual and all changes agreed upon with compromise necessary. No more \"Here, have your cake, eat it. Now do you want mine too?\"", "My jaw dropped, tbh that she wants him to make a man cave. But all hell broke loose hearing \"woman cave.\" \nSo it's fine kicking OP into one, but not the other way around?", "The much larger issue here, as someone who plays games and is a woman, is the blatant disrespect and disdain.\n\nIf my partner's friends were badmouthing me, and in our home no less, and she said nothing: that's the bigger issue.", "The fact that her friends have more say over their decor than her husband is bananas.", "\u201cLive Laugh Love\u201d x old-school creepy taxidermy mashups sound hilarious actually, you may have a business idea there", "Or find someone who is a PARTNER and makes life easier. Live happy", "> Why not go 50/50 right now?\n\nIt was supposed to be 50/50 but became 80/20. I didnt notice it happening. It was just small changes that ramped up. Even if I fight for 100/0 until we get to 50/50 it will never get to 50/50. If we do \"50/50 from this point onwards\" its going to be 90/10. \n\n> Also, if you have a spare room, why not use that as your office if you work from home?\n\nIts kind of small with a bad window and no sunlight. I would quickly get depressed spending all my working hours there.", "Giving my BF a man cave has eliminated 95% of decorating AND mess related problems (theyre contained and now i shut the door and its \u201cfixed\u201d LOL). And when we have another spare room one day, it will be mine :)", "People tend to get uppity when you start pointing out double standards, especially on Reddit.", "If you're using the lounge (living room?) 6 days a week as your office I don't think that's 80/20. You're taking up a bunch of space and may be overestimating what changes she's making. It should certainly be a compromise but you need an office that isn't in a communal space. What has she \"put away of yours?\" Is it a bunch of stuff from your gaming/hobbies that you keep in \"your workspace\" (aka the living room) which is taking over? NAH yet. You need to communicate and cooperate."]}
