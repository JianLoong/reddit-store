I missed that & figured she was 13. She\u2019s immature and internet addicted obviously. Seeks too much external validation.\n\nThat\u2019s all on the mom.

I was angered by hypocrisy and cruelty; what I did about it was apply a level of scrutiny that left no room for error.\u201d  Young people going through this phase can indeed be insufferable, but there\u2019s an understandable human feeling and need behind it, it\u2019s just misdirected.  \n\nIf the next time she brings something like this up, you can hide your understandable annoyance and ask her mildly and with interest what she hopes will happen when she says this, and what it means to her in the bigger scope of life, she might just start to realise she\u2019s been a bit of an affected niminiy-piminy chit (when merely telling her so would only make her too defensive to take it in).  \n\nI mean I doubt she\u2019ll stay away altogether.  The allure of Manhattan as compared to Hoboken can hardly be understated.  Perhaps she had some idea that her cool big-city uncle would be impressed by how tuned-in and mature in her judgement she was. NTA", "NTA\n\nThere are 3 levels of this:\n\n1. she has a passion/obsession - mostly fine, as long as there is no harm\n2. she imposes her obsession on other people - not okay\n3. she judges other people, their choices and characters,  through the prism  of her obsession - big, loud NO", "She's a gossip.

She's not looking at herself and asking, \"Am I too focused on this? Am I just boring people when I talk about this all the time? Do I concern myself too much with petty behaviors? Do I obsess over this too much?\"\n\nInstead, she decides the problem is you for causing her this embarrassment. The rising generation, sadly, is disproportionately narcissistic. They've never in their lives heard the word \"no.\" And they've never had their behaviors checked.\n\nAnd given her mother's reaction, it's not hard to see where your niece gets it from.\n\nIt's unfortunate because it will likely be a very long time, and require a great deal of ostracization before your niece even considers the problem is her.", "NTA. You delivered a basic, fairly non-controversial truth to your niece. Unfortunately, people of her age (and I - and every other older person on earth bar the narcissists - speak from personal experience here) can be pretty self righteous and so won't take any of that on board until they're older, life has hit them with a few serious swings of the home-truths bat and they've developed a bit of humility. \n\nYou're still right though.

Your niece has a bad case of brain worms.", "NTA, we all have our things, but it\u2019s not ok to just force them on anyone else.

Then you go home and lie around in your PJ's on The Big Day and watch whatever you want on TV, have your friends over, take naps, whatever you want to do.

Or anything?", "Slight TA only because you could have handled it better.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with telling someone you just don\u2019t enjoy these things but knowing how important it is to your niece you should have been a bit more sensitive.

You shouldn't have kicked her out over this, and those consequences are yours to deal with.  \n  \nSeriously though everyone has issues.  Nobody is perfect.  What issues matter enough to someone to boycott a given actor or company or whatever is their choice to make.

I feel like it goes both ways", "huh, is that what happened? my vague knowledge of that matter was that Doherty had apparently demanded more money and when they wouldn't pay her the increased amount she left.\n\n\\-\\_- the season-change when Prue (Doherty) left still gives me head spins if i try to rewatch the show - the disconnect (for me) is so severe that my brain always goes \"where the fuck are the missing episodes i clearly missed because end of season A *is not connecting* to beginning of season B so *where are the episodes i missed*\". except that, you know, there aren't missing episodes.", "I can see where you\u2019re coming from. As a neurodivergent person I probably have a different opinion on social skills-related issues such as this.\n\nI don\u2019t like expecting others to \u2018read the room\u2019, it\u2019s not something everyone can do effectively and even then everyone gets it wrong sometimes. I also think embarrassment can be an unhealthy feeling sometimes and doesn\u2019t always act as a good cue to pull ourselves up. Most of the time (in my experience at least) I\u2019ve found that people feel embarrassed about things they haven\u2019t actually done wrong, and sometimes they can be gaslit into feeling that way. \n\nI still think the niece was in the wrong here because she attempted to impede OP\u2019s enjoyment of the movie and make him feel guilty for nothing, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the wrong for sharing her obsessions in general. I\u2019m just not a fan of confining people to traditional social skills in that way if that makes sense", "Fair enough. I think it can be a very thin line between mentally healthy and mentally unhealthy, but it\u2019s a good thing to look out for I agree", "yeah I agree. I said I agree with the NTA judgement haha", "Plato (or maybe it was Aristotle?) Complained about the younger generation in his writing. It has been going on since very early yeah.", "I got sad when I read that best buy is not longer gonna sell them after this holiday season.", "just with the ease of streaming services people that live in highly developed areas dont tend to hold on to their dvd collections anymore. unless film is like a special interest to them.\n\nthe only people i know that routinely purchase dvds still are either older and dont like streaming or live in rural areas without internet access.", "Which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It's OP's home. He has every right to feel comfortable there. And if a guest is behaving in a tiresome, irritating, argumentative and boorish manner (which the niece is doing), he has every right to tell them to leave.\n\nIn OP's place, I would have told my sister, \"Thank you! I'd rather have Thanksgiving alone than an entire day of listening to your daughter's petty, tiresome bullshit about every celebrity who ever lived.\"", "It might be a regional difference, then. If I hear that somebody was kicked out, I assume that means their family, roommates, or building management no longer welcomed them to live there. I meant that she could come back another day.", "Oh for sure, what I was saying was that the Internet has exacerbated the problem, especially for people who have grown up with all the exposure to social media.\n\nMy generation were the first to have the Internet mass market, but we'd also had a childhood and adolescence where it wasn't ubiquitous.", "Ideally I\u2019d want it to be Home Improvement based, but I think Tim Allen might be too problematic. \ud83e\udd14", "The flip side of that is that your obsessions shouldn't create an *unsafe* space for your friends that doesn't allow them to enjoy the things *they* like.", "You should only be sharing obsessions with willing participation though. OPs niece wasn't taking that into consideration nor did she seem to care that she might be infringing on other people's special interests. This might have taught her a lesson about asking if people wanted to take part in that interest.", "Sharing obsessions is sharing things you enjoy and think are fun and want to spread joy to other people. It is not going \"uM hOw CaN yOu LiKe ThIs ThInG wItH tHiS pRoBlEmAtIc CeLeBrItY!?!?!?!?\" at literally every thing including dumb beef with a dumb boy band from ten years ago. That's not sharing your hobbies or obsessions, that's being an obnoxious pain in the ass who's going to VERY quickly find yourself with no friends once you're in an environment like college.", "> In OP's place, I would have told my sister, \"Thank you! I'd rather have Thanksgiving alone than an entire day of listening to your daughter's petty, tiresome bullshit about every celebrity who ever lived.\"\n\nSure some people just like to watch the world burn.  \n  \nOP sounds like he would like to have a relationship with his sister and niece.  He overreacted to her childish thing and is gonna need to backpedal or he'll never have one again.", "What kills me about this is that she claims that you ruined the city for her and it took so much for her to get there.\n\nHoboken to Manhattan is six miles. She could have ***walked*** that distance in two hours at a moderate pace.", "Binford would just go with Al everyone loves Al", "yeah understandable, the person with the obsession does have an end of the deal to uphold too. Sorry, I probably didn\u2019t communicate that well enough", "Ehhhh, fair enough I guess. Maybe I\u2019m just biased because I personally like when people feel comfortable to share their obsessions around me. I suppose not everyone feels that way", "yeah I don\u2019t disagree. I don\u2019t think the niece was in the right here, I\u2019m more speaking broadly", "Or niece could finally learn, after dealing with a few of her peers, that most people feel the same way about her petty nonsense.", "That just means you're a willing participant. But as much as I would like for I know not everyone wants me to talk to them about Baldurs Gate 3 so I only do with those who want to hear it", "What is the point of you \"speaking broadly\"? You keep arguing with people rightly pointing out that this behavior is incredibly off-putting and inconsiderate with weird points about how people should be allowed to \"share their obsessions in a safe space\". Being a controlling, self-righteous pest isn't a hobby or something that should be protected in a safe space.", "people are connecting the situation from this post to broader situations regarding this post (which is fine, just where I may slightly disagree with what is being said).

You might as well be saying \"well sure murder is bad but interpretive dance should still be respected as a college major\". You're just arguing for the sake of arguing.", "that\u2019s not the same thing at all \ud83d\ude2d also I just stated my opinion in response to the original top comment then responded to people who responded to me.\n\nyou are absolutely free to disagree there\u2019s no issue with that at all, but just because you disagree does not mean I\u2019m picking an argument with you"]}
