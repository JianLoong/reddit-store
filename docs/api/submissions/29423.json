I was angered by hypocrisy and cruelty; what I did about it was apply a level of scrutiny that left no room for error.\u201d  Young people going through this phase can indeed be insufferable, but there\u2019s an understandable human feeling and need behind it, it\u2019s just misdirected.  \n\nIf the next time she brings something like this up, you can hide your understandable annoyance and ask her mildly and with interest what she hopes will happen when she says this, and what it means to her in the bigger scope of life, she might just start to realise she\u2019s been a bit of an affected niminiy-piminy chit (when merely telling her so would only make her too defensive to take it in).  \n\nI mean I doubt she\u2019ll stay away altogether.  The allure of Manhattan as compared to Hoboken can hardly be understated.  Perhaps she had some idea that her cool big-city uncle would be impressed by how tuned-in and mature in her judgement she was. NTA", "NTA\n\nThere are 3 levels of this:\n\n1. she has a passion/obsession - mostly fine, as long as there is no harm\n2. she imposes her obsession on other people - not okay\n3. she judges other people, their choices and characters,  through the prism  of her obsession - big, loud NO", "She's a gossip.

It is our cue to look at our behaviors and see how they affect our ability to socialize. What is problematic here is your niece's (and your sister's) reaction to being called out. She's not looking at herself and asking, \"Am I too focused on this? Am I just boring people when I talk about this all the time? Do I concern myself too much with petty behaviors? Do I obsess over this too much?\"\n\nInstead, she decides the problem is you for causing her this embarrassment. The rising generation, sadly, is disproportionately narcissistic. They've never in their lives heard the word \"no.\" And they've never had their behaviors checked.\n\nAnd given her mother's reaction, it's not hard to see where your niece gets it from.\n\nIt's unfortunate because it will likely be a very long time, and require a great deal of ostracization before your niece even considers the problem is her.", "NTA. You delivered a basic, fairly non-controversial truth to your niece. Unfortunately, people of her age (and I - and every other older person on earth bar the narcissists - speak from personal experience here) can be pretty self righteous and so won't take any of that on board until they're older, life has hit them with a few serious swings of the home-truths bat and they've developed a bit of humility. \n\nYou're still right though.

Your niece has a bad case of brain worms.", "NTA, we all have our things, but it\u2019s not ok to just force them on anyone else.

Then you go home and lie around in your PJ's on The Big Day and watch whatever you want on TV, have your friends over, take naps, whatever you want to do.

Or anything?", "Slight TA only because you could have handled it better.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with telling someone you just don\u2019t enjoy these things but knowing how important it is to your niece you should have been a bit more sensitive.

You shouldn't have kicked her out over this, and those consequences are yours to deal with.  \n  \nSeriously though everyone has issues.  Nobody is perfect.  What issues matter enough to someone to boycott a given actor or company or whatever is their choice to make.

Learning about critical thinking and logic when I was at university was a game changer.  I was always a questioner, but these gave me real tools.  And she\u2019s probably young enough to learn still.  Older people, like my parents, often refuse to change.  I\u2019m always having to point these things out to them.  And they\u2019ll realize I\u2019m right about the claims being suspect, because I ask them questions and point out obvious problems (like who is making the claim and it is never anyone credible), but then they forget everything I said about *why* and it\u2019s something else tomorrow.", "They\u2019ll raise a generation of kids like us who got embarrassed when our parents made a scene at the restaurant or grocery store because something was slightly overcooked or an item was $.50 off from the advertised price and instead of calmly asking for it to be fixed, they threw a massive temper tantrum", "This is really interesting \u2b06\ufe0f", "My husband and I watched it again recently, too. *The Mask* has some pretty timeless themes. Plus a cute doggy!", "Got it. Thankfully, I dislike Jim Carey as an actor, with the exception of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind which I loved.\n\nMy distaste for his manic energy makes it easy to avoid watching his films and getting angry about his anti-vaccine advocacy.", "Agreed. \n\nThis generation seems to really value open mindedness and inclusivity, but they are surprisingly rigid thinkers in general. \n\nWhich is a tough flaw. \n\nI had a kid come into the foster system because she was bisexual and gender nonconforming, and her parents were VERY strict Muslims who did not accept that. \n\nShe invited me to a presentation she did in her civics class, where she told her classmates about her background and her life experience. It was very well done. \n\nThose kids were fucking **brutal** to her, though. \n\nThey accepted her sexual preference and her gender identity. But grilled the shit out of her for not completely cutting off her parents, and continuing to follow some religious traditions that they saw as problematic (like her diet and dress). \n\nThe teacher had to intervene and speak VERY bluntly to them about respect and bullying. It\u2019s cool that the teens were passionate about institutional misogyny. But if you try to attack someone over their religious or cultural identity being problematic\u2026You\u2019ve kind of done a 180 and are back to being bigoted.", "That's fair.  I've certainly enjoyed things that involved people who evolved into unsavory types.  Given the sheer number of people involved in large films, I can see why so many people are conflicted on how to handle them. \n\nPersonally,  I would like a reality TV show where celebrities attend middle school and high school science classes,  complete the work,  and throw tantrums at being proven wrong by a 13 year old's bio report. \n\nThat would give me manic energy.", "Harriet wanted to know everything, right? Wrote down everything she saw and everything she thought about what she saw in her notebook. Spoiler: She wasn\u2019t always saying nice things, and eventually her notebook gets leaked. People didn\u2019t like seeing the nasty, judgmental things she wrote about them. Harriet is humiliated. Harriet has to take time to go to therapy and look inward. Harriet realizes she needs to have informed opinions and should stop passing judgement on everything she sees. \n\nTL;DR: the niece needs to learn the same lesson Harriet the Spy had to learn", "No one asked these celebrities to be shining example for,life.  They do one thing well, can\u2019t we appreciate that?  I had someone say Post Malone is a horrible role model.  What?  FFS, enjoy the music.  No one is saying face tats are always a top life choice.  The man is making a mint, enjoying life and releasing catchy AF music.  The end.   If these judgmental kids need a role model, follow the Pope. Oh look - Problematic!", "Very NTA.  People who act like they\u2019re on Tumblr 24/7 are exhausting to be around", "\u201cThe youth of today have strong but changeable passions.
