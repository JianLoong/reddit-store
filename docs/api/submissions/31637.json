JB has Sissy every other weekend, including after Thanksgiving this year. Sissy was with us for Thanksgiving.\n\nJB texted us the day before Thanksgiving to ask Sissy if she'd want to go to JB's mom's house (\"Gamma\") for the weekend, Sissy said yes. JB doesn't get along with her mother at all (her mom is very sweet, but years ago decided to stop enabling JB's poor life choices, so JB avoids her for anything but seeing JB's 3 kids, including Sissy). We texted to ask whether JB would pick up Sissy on Friday as usual, she replied that she was working out the details for us to meet her mother instead.\n\nHere's the thing - usually JB picks up Sissy here on Fridays, we pick her up at JB's house on Sundays with a 1 hour round trip. If we had to meet Gamma, it would be a two hour round trip both Friday and Sunday because she lives further away and we'd meet her in the middle to exchange Sissy. JB wants us to do the drive because it's much longer and she clearly isn't even going to see Sissy this weekend. I'm guessing she's not around town and is probably with her new partner's family. We don't want to do the twice over long drive, but we will this once so Sissy can see her Gamma and cousins.\n\nThere are two things I know about JB: 1) if we agree to do this long drive once, she'll keep arranging for her mom to have Sissy on JB's time and we'll have to keep doing the drive. Basically she'll take this as precedent for agreement. And 2) no matter how we phrase it, telling JB we will only do this once as a favor will start an argument about how we're making assumptions about her and we're not considering Sissy's feelings and on and on.\n\nWIBTA though if we explicitly tell JB we will only do this drive once, and if she wants Sissy to be anywhere else for a weekend, she needs to do the transportation? We are willing to drive somewhere that's within a half hour, like JB's sister's house, but not somewhere that puts hours of extra driving on us just because JB doesn't want to have her daughter on her custody time and wants to pretend she's doing everyone else a huge favor by letting Sissy stay with Gamma instead.", "created_utc": 1700834342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182sp2g/wibta_if_i_tell_stepdaughters_mom_its_her/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was guilted into travel being my responsibility as they were busy and finances tight with the wedding.\n\nI was a lot more naive then, and the handover involved me flying home from Perth to Melbourne with him as he was 2 years old at the time.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Australia, it\u2019s the west coast to the east coast. 3 h 35m flight and 2700km (1677 miles)\n\nDrove 2 hours to the airport, flew coast to coast, had a one hour layover (and well deserved beer) and flew straight back, with another 2 hour drive at the end.\n\nAfter that long ass day, I can guarantee I was more explicit with handover arrangements\n\nNot because time with extended family isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s expensive and hard work when you don\u2019t plan it fairly\n\nOver 7 hours flying, covered Australia twice and never left the airport at the destination \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\n\nDon't do the drive.

Also, if going to Gamma's house becomes the new norm like you're predicting, I would require someone meet you halfway on Sundays because it's BM who is changing the visitation. She can get her there and meet halfway for the ride back or Sissy can just stay home with you guys.", "Info-why are you this involved in their co-parenting?", "NTA. I would tell her we will take the kid to mom's house and not any farther. Dad should be really telling JB this. Also if there is a Court Order just follow that to the T. No deviations from it.", "YWNBTA this is a reasonable thing to say.", "NTA You definitely need to establish that up front! You already know she has issues and like you said soon you will be transporting Sissy everywhere on JBs time. You should probably clearly define who is supposed to pick up Sissy and when. Better yet, get a legal custody agreement in place clearly defining the terms.", "NTA, but I doubt she will listen. Does Gamma drive? If so is it possible for you guys to meet her halfway?

She said \u201cwe\u201d about talking to the ex. Why is everyone assuming she\u2019s stepping in where she doesn\u2019t belong?", "Of course YWNBTA. But if the mother has made a lot of poor choices and the grandmother has stopped enabling her, maybe it's better for Sissy to go to her grandmother? It could be beneficial for Sissy to se her mother less and the grandmother more. It could be beneficial for YOU in the long term if Sissy turns out better. You are the ones that will have to deal with her on a daily basis for many years to come. Maybe it's worth the extra driving?\n\nEdit: Grammar", "NTA - Let her know you're doing this once and only once.
