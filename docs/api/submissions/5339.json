When we first moved in together, I made significantly more money (\\~2x), so we agreed to split expenses on a ratio basis (approx. 30/70 at the time), as opposed to a 50/50 split.\n\nWhen my boyfriend decided he wanted to pursue a new career and go back to school, I was supportive. I'd seen how painful his current job (recruiting) was for him, especially during COVID, and I knew a change would be good for him (and us) personally and professionally.\n\nDuring the 4 months of his accelerated program, he was making no money, so I handled 100% of rent and utilities. I was happy to be in a position to support his dreams and new career, but our relationship wasn't in a good place, and a couple months after he completed the program, we decided to separate.\n\nOnce he got his new job, he left our apartment to move in with a friend from university, and I finished out the lease on my own. During the time we were separated, I closed on my first house, utilizing a majority of my savings for the down payment, closing costs, etc, but making sure that I could afford the house on my own (and any potential roommates could help lower the cost).\n\nAfter about 6 months separated, he let me know he wanted to try again and recognized where things had gone wrong. Because he signed a new lease when he moved out, our plan was to see how things were going with our relationship while he finished out the lease with his roommate, at which point we could evaluate whether moving in together again made sense.\n\nThings are going well and the plan was for him to move in later in January. **His new role is more fulfilling and has a much better salary than before, so the equitable split is now closer to 42/58.** When we talked about final plans and finances the other day, he got pissed off. He couldn't believe I would ask him to pay \"that much\" to live in a house that he \"doesn't even own\" and accused me of being \"clearly desperate for money.\" For reference, the split payment is $5 more per month (not including utilities, which we didn't even get to discussing) than his current rent payment which he and his roommate split 50/50 (despite his roommate making way less than my boyfriend).\n\nI was confused and surprised by his reaction, as this is the split we've always followed.\n\nAITA for expecting that he'll pay the amount set by the equitable split we've always followed?\n\nEdit: Should have used the term \u201crent\u201d in the title, as opposed to \u201cmortgage.\u201d In regard to rental agreement, I have suggested that (in line with what others have mentioned regarding rights/protections of both \u201ctenants\u201d and \u201clandlords\u201d) so that everything is clear up front for both of us.", "created_utc": 1671653461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrzesx/aita_my_boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_pay_his_portion/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I live in a house my fiance bought before we were married. I pay about 35-40% of the housing costs and for none of the repairs.

You pay for the freedom to live like it is your house without the obligation to repair things.

She's not trying to profit off of him, she is asking him to share in expenses fairly.  He is trying to move in and not pay any rent.

If it's basically what he's paying now to live with his roommate, I don't get the problem with him paying that to live with you, in probably a nicer place too.", "NTA. He should be paying rent wherever he lives. As he said, it's not his house. Fine. He should sign a month to month lease. You'll need to report the income, of course. OR he can contribute the same amount & just use it to pay a larger portion of other bills in a \"roommate agreement\" so the money is paid directly to the utilities companies.", "NTA. Tell him if he refuses to pay a fair share of the bills and rent then he won't be moving it. It's not about paying you money, but contributing for the increased expenses him living there will cost. Utilities, food, household goods, hygiene stuff, cleaning and cooking supplies all go up.\n\nI suggest you rethink your plans. No one falls in love quicker then someone who needs a place to stay op.

The equitable share of *imputed rent* paid to you, however, is 50/50, since you both occupy the space equally.\n\nTo some extent, I don\u2019t think you can credibly offer him the protections of a tenant. You can\u2019t guarantee a year\u2019s lease, for instance; if you break up, you\u2019ll want him to leave as soon as possible (and he\u2019ll probably want to, to protect himself.) He really, genuinely enjoys a lot fewer protections, at least practically, when his housing is tied to your romantic partnership.\n\nSo the rent he pays should be a lot less than market rent - your home is less valuable to him than the equivalent alternative because he\u2019s a lot less protected.", "NTA I hope rethink letting this guy move in.", "Find a completely NEW guy!!! \n\nNTA", "NTA don't let him move in to your house", "NTA\n\n\nWhen I moved in with my now-wife I paid what her roommate was paying.

Every dollar that goes towards capital is like depositing money in your savings account. It's not an expense. If he's paying it with you, you're getting richer at his expense. The tenant/landlord thing is an absurd mirage. Entering into contracts meant for strangers while being a couple doesn't make any sense. Your local laws might also not allow for such a lease to stand. \n\nMoving in together when one owns a house with a mortgage is a complicated thing and requires a lot of communication and negotiation. You both need to be exactly on the same page regarding immediate financial issues but also future one. What if it all goes well and you're still together in several years? What if you get married? If he's paying part of your mortgage, are you also combining your savings accounts? What about repairs, renovations, decoration, etc? What about when he has saved enough to buy his own property? \n\nThat being said, it takes a lot of nerve to show up again and not offer to pay you back for supporting him through his training program that clearly landed him a better job. Are you sure this is a person you want more financial entanglements with? He doesn't sound like he cares about your financial well-being and it doesn't sound like any negotiation would ever be fair.

Honestly the cheek of thinking he gets to live for free, thanks to the saving and progress you guys made *when he left you* would have me rethinking things.

Probably realized how hard it is to pay your own bills and now wants to fall back on you. If you actually fall for his gaslighting I can almost guarantee that he\u2019s going to leave again once his bank account is nice and fat. \n\nNTA, but you need to open your eyes to all of the red flags. You supported him through his worst and he can\u2019t even provide his fair share now that he\u2019s better off. AND he\u2019s envious of your accomplishments. That\u2019s not a partner, that\u2019s a leech.", "100% this.", "So when it comes to earning equity in the house he\u2019s her tenant and gets nothing despite paying half her mortgage every month? But when it comes to paying for maintaining the house suddenly he\u2019s her equal partner? That is definitely unfair to him. They can be partners or they can be landlord and tenant when it comes to finances. Certainly emotionally they can still be partners. He can help find the plumber who will fix the burst pipe, but he shouldn\u2019t pay for it. He can go with her to shop for a new stove or fridge for the kitchen and help her carry it in the house. He should still do all the regular emotional labor of being her partner, but if he is treated like a tenant when it benefits her, she needs to act like a landlord when it benefits him."]}
