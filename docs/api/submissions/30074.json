I was genuinely on the fence about it and have decided after reading through the comments to have a more appropriate consequence instead of taking away Halloween.

Taking away Halloween isn\u2019t proportionate to her behavior, and won\u2019t really teach her anything except how to be miserable.\n\nTalk with her about how dangerous it was to bring her friend over without getting approval. I also question how the school allowed that; they don\u2019t usually allow kids to go with other adults unless approved by the parents?\n\nAnd as for her other behavior, that\u2019s\u2026literally just a kid being a kid. Teachable moments. Help her regulate her frustration better by teaching her calming strategies when she\u2019s calm.", "YTA. Do not take away Halloween unless you want her to despise you far into the future.\n\nYes, you should do something to discipline her so she does not repeat the behavior but missing a holiday she has been looking forward to is taking it too far.", "YTA. She's 8, this all sounds like normal \"bad\" behavior for an 8 year old. Taking away Halloween for her would be a horrible way to punish her, please don't do that. That would be way way too much. There are plenty of other more appropriate ways to punish her.", "YTA\n\nYes, this would be an overreaction. She's 8. It's a teaching moment. Don't teach her that authority is never to be trusted or respected because it is not fair.", "YTA - This \"punishment\" is not related to her bad behavior at all so what lesson will she learn? She will learn that her parents suck. She lied and tried to sneak a friend over. Consequenes to that could be that she cannot have friends visit for 2 weeks and if she does goes over to someone else's house you or your spouse must supervise until she earns your trust again by being honest and kind because she just demonstrated that she isn't truthful when it comes to playdates and safety. As for her getting frustrated with the pumpkin, that sounds normal. If you mean she handled her frustration poorly (for example screaming, giving up, ruining the pumpkin on purpose) that isn't something you punish, that is something you need to correct by doing other similar level difficultily activies wiht her and teach her how to manage her emotions. That is your job as a parent, not randomly taking away once a year holiday experiences simply because you can.   \n\n\nI also think you need to explain in detail exactly why safety and pre-approved playdates are necessary. Parents need to know where their children are at all times or dangerous things can happen. Is there a reason your daughter thought it wouldn't be okay to ask this other boy's parents if he can come over as well? It might be helpful for you to know why she thought this was the best course of action, this can help you correct the behavior.", "Ywbta.  Don't take away the kids holiday.  Sure address the behavior but taking away Halloween is not the way to do it.", "Even with children, punishments should be logical consequences from the bad behavior.\n\nIf the \"not listening\" is \"she was on her phone instead of doing this dishes like you said\" then a punishment could be \"after dinner, you have to give me your phone until all the dishes are done.\" If she lies to you about having permission to have friends over, she can't invite anyone over for some amount of time. The list goes on. \n\nActions have consequences, not punishments.", "YTA,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's 8, if she was 13 or 12 I would get it because at that age you know better.", "YWBTA. No play dates for a few weeks would be a far more appropriate punishment than taking away trick-or-treating.", "YTA.  My 5 yo daughter hasn't been listening today and I threatened her with \"next time you don't listen we're not going trick or treating\" but she's so excited to go that I wouldn't take it away from her.  I'm normally pretty firm and stick to punishments, but she's been looking forward to today for weeks.  If she acts up again, I will ground her tomorrow, but I'm not ruining Halloween.  It would be the same for Christmas.", "YWBTA.  My kids are 16 and 18 now.  You only get these precious years for a little while.  I\u2019d have her apologize to her friend\u2019s mom and maybe be some extra chores or something.  And maybe I\u2019d cancel play dates for a week or two.  But no, I would not cancel Halloween.", "YTA\n\nThis is the nuclear option. \n\nYou do this, you risk severely damaging the parent/child relationship.", "You should've done something yesterday when that situation happened.  There's no point in punishing her for yesterday now. As far as today, you need to sit her down and explain why what she did was not okay. In other words, actually parent your kid. It sounds like you don't do anything when she does something you don't like.", "YWBTA.\n\nDon't take away a once a year holiday that little ones are so excited for over this. Have a very frank talk with her about these issues and how, going forward, things like this won't be tolerated and will be met with specific consequences, but don't take Halloween away at the last minute. You'll do more harm than good.", "YTA - Taking away 1x a year holidays is too far. You can punish her in other ways that aren\u2019t so extreme.", "YTA - Look, the things your child did may call for punishment but you don't do it by taking away a key part of childhood memories. You do more routine things like take all chargers to electronic devices, or have a rational discussion followed by reasonable punishment. You don't take away a holiday unless you are prepared for your child one day describing this to a mental health professional in their adulthood and going no contact.", "YTA.  \nI knew a kid growing up whose parents took away holidays and birthdays as punishments.  \n\n\nHe doesn't talk to them as an adult.", "YWBTAH.  Do not cancel Halloween. Some acting up is normal with the extra stimulation this time of year.", "Honestly I don't know.. I want to say N.T.A but like i feel it's too harsh. I just think she is really excited for the holiday which is why she is acting like this. But I also don't want to say Y.T.A because I know where you're coming from. Maybe just try a more light 'punishment'.", "I\u2019m not going to judge. I will give advice however. Let her go trick or treating but I\u2019d ground her from all other activities for a couple of weeks and explain why she\u2019s being punished. I can\u2019t believe all the people on here calling you the AH. Actions have consequences. You\u2019re doing the best you can. Halloween is not the coming of Christ. It wouldn\u2019t kill her to miss it", "I'm gonna go against the grain and sau NTA. Actions have consequences. Consequences are supposed to suck.", "Actions have consequences, it doesn't matter if it's a holiday. The lesson she may learn is that doing something bad on/around holidays will have lesser consequences. I'd go easy on her this time, but watch and make sure she doesn't take advantage of using holidays to mitigate her punishment in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. Since when did carving a pumpkin turn from fun into a mandatory job that needs to be done, even if you feel sick and are not in the mood? Why the hell do we need holidays with coercion and punishment for not celebrating strictly according to the instructions?", "NTA\n\nScrew around, find out.", "There's also the fact that kids tend to act up more just before holidays or events because it can be difficult for them to recognize and regulate their emotions in anticipation of big events. Noticing and handling this is a part of parenthood. Sure, it sucks, because adults want things to run smoothly, but cancelling the holiday isn't teaching the kid much.", "The daughter is 8, in most schools only kindergarteners and younger have that strict we have to see a parent or guardian before you can leave (unless it's checking out early), so it isn't that strange for the friend to be able to go home with them.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "My god the child is EIGHT. You don\u2019t ground tiny children. Grounding barely works for teens. It teaches them fear and how to be sneakier. Not real life consequences.", "Yes but if you are trying to teach that a certain behavior is wrong shouldn't the consequences be related to the action? Taking away a holiday experience has nothing to do with lying about a playdate. A consequence to the child's actions could be \"no playdates at her house for a few weeks and any events at a friends house can only happen if one of her parents is there to supervise everything because child as demonstrated they can't be trusted yet. After 2 weeks of continuous honest and kind behavior they can go back to normal as trust has been re-earned. It's okay to make mistakes but I firmly believe that taking things away and making your child miserable in the anme of unrelated punishment is not the best way to correct behavior. I think the parent also needs to explain in detail exactly why safety and pre-approved playdates are necessary. Parents need to know where their children are at all times or dangerous things can happen.", "Everybody who says \"actions have consequences\" is getting downvoted. I bet a lot of these people that are downvoting don't have kids, and if they do, their kids are the ones throwing tantrums in public until their parent caves.", "Actions have proportionate consequences. This is disproportionate. \n\nA lot of people only have a handful of trick-or-treating memories in their lives. It\u2019s a once-in-a-year event and taking it away won\u2019t teach the child anything, just cause confusion and hurt. It also just seems like a lazy parenting cop-out; it would only \u201cwork\u201d because the trouble happens to take place around Halloween. What would they do if this happened any other time of the year and there isn\u2019t a holiday to conveniently take away? Consequences for kids needs consistency, and that can\u2019t happen if the consequence is \u201close a holiday.\u201d", "When do you teach your kids that actions have consequences, when they're a teenager and they no longer listen to you? If she forms the habit of lying to get what she wants now and there are no consequences, do you think she's going to just give it up in a couple years?", "I raised 3 kids. At 8 they\u2019re plenty old enough to know better and to have consequences for bad behavior. My kids turned out pretty great and we are very close. The only side effect from consequences was raising successful, productive and respectful young ladies. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You can think and argue whatever you want that's totally your right. I'd still not let my kids go trick or treating or hanging out with friends. My kids would be grounded.", "You\u2019re not very clever or good at being a caretaker if you think grounding an 8 year old is the only way to teach a lesson. Grounding in fact has been shown to not really work at all! Do better\n\nI also literally never said (and never would say) children shouldn\u2019t learn consequences lol but consequences should make SENSE. Punishing a small child from Halloween, who\u2019s brain hasn\u2019t developed even halfway and can\u2019t grasp certain concepts, isn\u2019t teaching them shit. It\u2019s teaching them their caretakers are harsh. It\u2019s called: talk to them. Explain why this is dangerous. Explain the consequences this could have on everyone involved. Have them apologize to the other kids parents. And then implement a new rule for having friends over, parent must confirm with other parent until you\u2019re older.\n\nWow look at that. No grounding needed. And you still teach the kid about consequences and you move them to a new arrangement that takes away some freedom since they abused it.", "People who were beat by their parents can also grow up to be well adjusted lmao \n\nI\u2019m absolutely NOT equating that to how you patented. I jsut think that\u2019s an insipid comment. It\u2019s also anecdotal. I\u2019m referring to actual data and longitudinal studies that show XYZ works better. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to use different methods. It\u2019s okay to shy away from harsh methods especially when it\u2019s not called for. \n\nI stand by my statement though that if the only way a parent can \u201cparent\u201d is through harsh punishments, they\u2019re doing a disservice to their kid. \n\nMy sister and I came from a harsh household, and she has decided to break that cycle. Guess what. All 3 of her kids are great too (and my tolerance for genuinely bad behavior is low, kids get a lot of passes from ke because psychology but some things are just bad) And she doesn\u2019t ground them lol", "I totally agree. Some of these comments explain why crime is rampant lately.", "I'm going off what you said, not what you thought in your head and decided to say later. Go ahead, insult me some more. I'm sure with that superiority complex, you'll feel better afterward.", "Weird seeing as there\u2019s absolutely no empirical data saying \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d is positively correlated with crime LOL what are y\u2019all on? \n\nThere are mountains of research, books, courses, etc on how to use appropriate consequences and how to get your children to think through those things. Another crazy part of that is those methods don\u2019t often involve massive punishments! Who knew! \n\nThe kid is 8, they may have known this was \u201cwrong\u201d but they don\u2019t have the brain development to think beyond \u201cmommy and daddy would be mad if I got caught\u201d. Welcome to child development 101. \n\nThis is a teachable moment. You explain to your kid that doing this, while innocent, could really scare her friends parents. It could lead to trouble for mommy and daddy. We have to follow certain rules about having friends over because of safety. Etc. you discuss this, you then implement a new rule: \u201csince you broke our trust, we need to take some extra steps to rebuild that. So before anyone can come home with you, we have to confirm with their parents\u201d \n\nTaking Halloween from your kid won\u2019t teach them shit. Talking to them, TEACHING them real life consequences, and giving them an extra step of accountability WILL do that. Taking away birthdays or holidays (especially for a freaking 8 year old lol) will only teach them pain/fear and/or how to lie better", "I don't think some people don't understand that they could have gotten charged with kidnapping if the parents wanted to press charges. My kids would be grounded for a couple months pulling something like that I'd have a sit down talk about the consequences and what they could have been if the situation didn't turn out the way it did. People are going to say oh they are just kids but then it's those same people that say kids have rights and their feelings should mean more.", "Crazy can you show me where exactly I said kids shouldn\u2019t face any consequences?

Not what I could imply. Right?", "I didn\u2019t change the whole meaning of any comment LOL all my edits are before replies and usually because I had another thought come up. Is that your new argument? LOL\n\nEspecially not my original comment. I never wrote the words kids don\u2019t need consequences. You just implied that because I said don\u2019t ground an 8 year old\n\nOh and yes that 2nd but was an edit. I have no shame because I\u2019m not being shady lol", "I was the kid who had holidays and birthdays yanked away from them when I was kid. I resented it then and I resent it now. I despise holidays and my birthday because so many were ruined. I never make plans to celebrate any of them because in the back of my mind, someone will ruin them for me. Kids don\u2019t forgot.  I\u2019m the perfect example. Ground the kid, tell them no play dates for however long\u2026 but NEVER take away a holiday or a birthday.", "Ywbta, you\u2019re both punishing too late and trying to punish completely normal childlike behavior. Taking away an entire Holiday will never be the appropriate reaction to misbehavior.", "YTA. It is too late now, but Halloween has nothing to do with what she is doing except the day coincided.", "That depends on location, in both states I\u2019ve lived in written permission is required in all of elementary school (which can range K-6th grade).", "If parents are giving out punishments that don\u2019t fit the misbehavior they need help. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f taking away an entire Holiday is not justified in this situation and may set a distrust into the kid if thy were excited or preparing for trick or treating", "Did you edit every comment after the conversation is over to make yourself look better lmao", "Nope!

Please feel free to post any screen shots showing I completely changed comments (not just added to them before you or anyone else replied) as that was just further thoughts. \n\nAgain you\u2019re only attacking me\u2026editing comments to add more thoughts.
