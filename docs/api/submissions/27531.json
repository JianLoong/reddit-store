She's been in several toxic and/or abusive relationships before we got together and she ensured I was aware of that before we started dating.\n\nTo get to the point, yesterday we kind of got into an argument. To cut things short, I was pretty overwhelmed after work and she kept asking me questions about whatever flew through her head. This went on for a while. Unfortunately that being overwhelmed turned into some sort of panic/anxiety attack (I'm not exactly sure what it exactly is, that's what my doctor assumes they are). During those I can hardly speak, breathe pretty heavily, my blood runs cold, can't hear anything properly and feel like everything around me was spinning. It's never happened to me while she was around and I've never told her it happens, because it's pretty rare. \n\nShe poked me, then shook me a little to which I just moved her arm away. I looked at the ground until it was over and assumed she was still next to me on the couch. Once I calmed down it turned out she wasn't. I got up and called for her and eventually she came out of the (locked) bedroom. \n\nI asked her why she left and she told me she was scared. After that point it turned into somewhat of an argument. I kind of huffed and asked her What's she's scared of, to which she replied she was scared of me. Scared that I'd hurt her. In that moment, hearing that made me feel disconnected to her. And it was also a bit laughable to me, because I couldn't even see straight and she was \"scared\" of me. She told me that I need to understand her point of view, to which I told her \"Why are you even with me when you don't even trust me not to harm you?\" She got quiet for a bit and then just said I wouldn't understand. \n\nI still didn't quite get what I did wrong, so I asked my older sister who told me I should be more understanding regarding her trauma, but I also think I'm not in the wrong for not wanting my girlfriend to be scared of me.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: Bad wording", "created_utc": 1695556531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qvx4u/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_why_are_you_even/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not 'an' asshole, but you were a bit wrong in how you handled this.\n\nFirstly, you could really have told her about the panic attacks.  I'm sure it was distressing and a little scary to witness.  What she would have seen is someone clearly struggling with powerful/overwhelming emotions.  She didn't know what was happening and didn't know what those emotions were - they could have been anger - so she removed herself just in case.  She would not have needed to do that if you'd told her beforehand they were panic attacks.\n\nSecondly, you had a strong emotion (panic/anxiety) and your girlfriend had a strong emotion (fear).  You are insulted by your girlfriend's emotion and seem to want her to stop having it.  But you should know from your own experience that emotions don't work like that.  No-one is telling you to stop having panic attacks when there's nothing to panic about, and it wouldn't work if they did.  Emotions can be worked on and managed but not just willed into non-existence.  Your girlfriend has a hightened fear response just like you have panic attacks.  Either deal with it or break up with her but don't get upset with her about it.", "YTA:\n\nHow can she respond positively to your real-time disassociation with anything other than fear given her experience?\n\nYou didn't even given give her the chance to because you never gave her that information (secret keeping).\n\nI'd be scared of you too if you started 'turning off' in conversations without any explanation. She wasn't scared of you before you started acting strange and hiding things from her - but given she is \"gun-shy\" what other response would you expect?\n\nThings can change pretty fast.", "YTA. she is not a mind reader. Of course she's scared of sudden changes in behavior. The fact you find her trauma reactions \"laughable\" tell me you are not ready to be in a relationship with someone so severely traumatized. Be a better bf of gtfo", "Esh. You hid what you described as a pretty severe medical issue from her and are upset she got scared about ehat looks like an insane reaction to questions.\n\nShe sees you have an alarming reaction that incapacitates you and her first instinct was to leave you to your fate.\n\n\nNeither of you seems ready to be dating in any serious capacity", "YTA.\n\nYou started acting strangely in front of her, and she had no context for what was going on because you kept that information from her. It's no wonder she got scared, especially if withdrawing affection was a prelude for abuse in some of her previous relationships.\n\nIt's easy for you to say \"you couldn't see straight\", but *she doesn't fucking know that*. All she knows is that one moment she's grilling you, and the next you start acting really weird.", "YTA, your lack of communication is the issue here. She was very upfront about her previous relationships with you, when people have a history of being abused then unexplained change in behaviours can be terrifying. You should have taken the time to explain what was happening, or even took the time afterwards to comfort her and give an explanation instead of rushing to judgement about the way she responded.", "YTA\n\nAbuse comes from people we love and trust. Of course she's going to be scared if you're acting in an unusual manner and she's been abused in the past. Her trust has been betrayed many times, so of course she will be guarded.\n\nYour argument that she shouldn't be with you because she is scared of being abused is very dismissive of how past abuse affects people. \n\nWhy didn't you tell her about your panic attacks? Don't you trust *her*?", "unless your gf is a telepath, YTA.", "YTA\n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from, but all of the confusion could have been avoided if you\u2019d been as up front about your episodes as she was about her past relationships. It would have been N A H until you tried to put it on her.", "YTA here, your girlfriend had a trauma response because you acted in a way you never have before during an argument, you\u2019re not an asshole but its cold to say its laughable especially", "YTA.\n\n\"Why are you even with me when you don't even trust me not to harm you?\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right\". (leaves for good)", "NAH.\n\nYou aren't an AH for wanting your girl to not be scared of you. but given her past trauma, its understandable how she behaved. i think the optimal solution over here would be to sit her down and explain your panic attacks to her as well as what your expectations from the relationship are. also try and reassure her about yourself. if she has had multiple abusive relationships it will take her a while to gain that trust. therapy might also help, if its already not present.", "[removed]", "I agree that you have to be understanding of her trauma. But shouldn't she be understanding of your panic attacks and anxiety as well?", "Nah.", "NTA - In fact, no one's the a\\*hole. It's just a difficult situation. It would probably help if you both sat down and talked about some triggers to get them out in the open. She's kind of right about that you didn't understand but it's not your fault. Don't take it personally, her reaction is less about how she feels about you and more about how she's been treated in the past. \n\nAbuse comes from people we trust, that's why it's abusive. That's why people in abusive relationships often stay much longer and continue to suffer. It's because they trusted and loved their abuser long before they became the abuser. So the fear of you turning around and harming her when you suddenly became non-responsive, isn't something she can control. It's not that she doesn't trust you. She does trust you, enough to share her past trauma and still be in a relationship with you. It's that in the past, people she's trusted have broken that trust and hurt her anyway.\n\nHer brain went into survival mode and yes, it turns out it was unnecessary but she couldn't have known that at the time. Her brain reacted based on her own past (old information) and since she didn't know you experienced anxiety attacks (new information) she wasn't able to accurately read that situation and provide the support you needed in that moment. \n\nHope you both can talk it out and start to understand each other's perspectives. Again though NTA.", "NTA. People like your GF shouldn\u2019t date if they\u2019re that scared.", "NTA. You were having a panic attack, at this point you'd need your partner to support YOU. But after probing and poking and nagging you into a panic attack she makes it about her being scared of you because you were upset. This reeks of victim complex/narcicism.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Not mentioning this to her is a miscommunication on your part. Not everybody knows how to respond or how to help during a panic attack/mental health crisis. I think it\u2019s natural she would be scared in a moment where she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you and you\u2019re arnt able to respond to her. So, try to be more sensitive to that. \n\nI think the best thing to do is talk to her, tell what\u2019s going on with you, and how she can support you better in the future. This doesn\u2019t have to be relationship ending.", "Why are you even with her when you don\u2019t even trust her enough to tell her your struggles ?", "GF also has something to work on, if they stay together, if her constant questions help trigger a panic attack for OP.\n\nThey may simply be incompatible on the mental health axis. Her constant questions help trigger a panic attack, at which point that triggers fear in GF. They could spend a lot of therapy unwinding that, or maybe it's simpler to just break up.", "I wasn't keeping a secret. It would've been a secret if it was happening and I was actively hiding it. I just didn't tell her because it happens maybe twice a year at most so I didn't deem it necessary to share.", "honestly that would be reasonable for both, so I don't see the YTA for this particular outcome.", "It wasn\u2019t an anger response. What are you talking about?", "OP says in his post that he hadn't told her about them, and that this was her first time encountering them.", "This is the first time the panic attack has happened around the girlfriend, so it seems like she's not a major cause.  A bit of adjustment (like a codeword when he's getting overwhelmed and needs to stop talking) would probably stop the panic attack happening again around her.  And her knowing about the panic attacks and that they're not dangerous will probably stop her being afraid in the future.  A lot of this was lack of communication.", "Yeah but even in the moment, you could have told her it was a panic attack or that you felt weird or given her any context to what was going on. I get panic attacks too, there are ways to communicate that you\u2019re feeling one coming on or that you feel off or overwhelmed. You\u2019re also only thinking of your feelings as real and valid and dismissing your girlfriend\u2019s feelings entirely. You know her history because she\u2019s shared that with you despite those people not even being a part of her life anymore, but you couldn\u2019t have shared at any point, even in the moment, that you have debilitating panic attacks that make it impossible for you to tell if someone is sitting next to you or not. The way you tell it makes it seem like you shut down like a robot, but she can\u2019t have any reaction to that when she doesn\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on. She has experienced abuse, she could absolutely be feeling like you were going to explode any minute or that you were purposefully giving her the silent treatment as a way to make her feel bad for something she might have done to you. You\u2019re not wrong for having a panic attack, but you could have told her and you should have been more understanding that she was confused and afraid, instead of being mad at her for having her uncontrollable feelings. You also could have told her that her questions and talking to you was overwhelming you before it got to the point that you had a panic attack, but it seems as though you let your anxiety about ruining the mood and the day cloud your judgment and ignore your own needs in order to placate her or make her not feel annoying or something. You should have advocated for yourself earlier, although I do understand feeling like you\u2019re burdening someone or making someone feel bad for talking. But soft YTA for not standing up for yourself and then blaming your girlfriend for not reading your mind.", "But I agree, he should have told her when she told him about her", "If you see a person in panic attack, you won't fear they're gonna attack you, you would fear they're dying.\nThat's how a panic attack looks like", "No it doesn't neccessarily. It all depends on how you internally react to panic.\n\nI, for example, go completely silent, deaf and blind when i get a (fortunately very rare) full blown panic attack. Of course i'm not really blind or deaf but i don't realize what surrounds me, whenever im \"in the zone\". And for an abuse victim, this can totally look like the intro to abuse, depending of what her previous partners did.", "Op self described his panic attacks as him staring at a fixed point and holding his breath likely getting red faced\u2026\u2026 thats also how a pissed off abuser would look right before beating you senseless", "I get hungry during panic attacks. I go on binge eats.\nAnd I fall sleep when I get out of it", "No I didn't. I said I looked to the floor, which was more of a grounding-measure to the spinning. I don't get redfaced, I get pale. I've been told I look extremely disorientated during them. You can't misquote me and then label my behavior as looking like a \"pissed off abuser\".", "As I said,  NAH, there needs to be better communication.\nPoor lady was traumatized by her past abusers and panicked.\nPoor guy has been squashed by patriarchy and he thought he doesn't need to open up about his mental health as \"it rarely happens\"", "can you believe that every ones panic attacks look different and that the way they happen to you is not important in this conversation?", "There is no indication \u201cpatriarchy\u201d played any role in op being unable/unwilling to\nDisclose pivotal info.\n\nPersonally i feel its an esh situation. His secrecy led to this and her locking herself in a room while he had his panic attack was the worst response she could have had.\n\n\nNeither seems ready to handle a serious relationship especially with each other\n\nThats not even touching on the fact that this all started with simply asking random questions.", "Actually,  it is important \nPanic attacks are classified according to response, risk stratification and that decides the coping/grounding mechanism, treatment options and safety netting.\nAnd also, the commenter (not OP) I was talking to was describing their panic attack features and I was describing mine. None were primarily talking about OP in that sentence", "Actually,  patriarchy does play a lot of role in these situations. A lot of men do not seek the help they need because they feel they can handle it, or that they shouldn't. \n\n>Thats not even touching on the fact that this all started with simply asking random questions.\n\nI agree, on the outside it does seem trivial. But when one adds in the fact that he was already overwhelmed (meaning peopled out), she kept on pushing (not her fault, but still, an accidental fire is still a fire). \nAs I said, they both need to work on theor communication. That's why I'd go with NAH.\n\nWell, there is one TA. The OP's sister, who disregarded his problem completely and went, you should be more considerate", "im saying *YOUR* panic attacks aren\u2019t important *RIGHT NOW*. not that different panic attacks don\u2019t matter. they were describing theirs simply bc you incorrectly stated that \u201cyou won\u2019t fear they\u2019re going to attack you\u201d. they were just telling you that it *is* possible to be afraid of someone during *their* panic attacks.", "1.
