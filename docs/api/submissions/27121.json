When in line my ex made a remark about me and was underhanded insulting me because at the time i had undiagnosed seizures so i wouldn't go into the thick of the crowd, he was just being awful.. A group of 20+yr olds (guys and gal heard this, pulled me away to put me in front of them in line, asked if i was okay, and shamed him out of the line. When someone went to complain that they moved me, one of the girls explained they were saving me from someone abusive and everyone in line was ready to fight. Anyways,  the group of 8 of them took me and 2 of my other friends under their wing, and they formed a mini circle around me when a local band was preforming and didn't have as big of a crowd so i get the crowd experience, even though it was on the edge of the crowd, but had watchful eyes in case i had a seizure, so that they could jump in and carry me out.\nCore memory, i have other great memories at rock concerts, not that crazu, but i will die on the hill that rock concerts have the best percentage of the bwst manners of any concert goers."]}
