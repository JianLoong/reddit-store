I said, \"Excuse me what did you say?\" He tried to intimidate me by glaring down at me without saying a word.

She said \"I have priority boarding!\" This was the security line. So I said \"well here you dont\"& refused to give her space to cut. she awkwardly stood next to the line as it moved forward until someone eventually let her cut in , maybe she learned,maybe not", "NTA, and kudos to you!", "I noticed that in the  ferry lines in Greece. Some people lined up and others didn\u2019t. When the boarding started it was a mad dash one woman actually got trampled and broke her leg.", "I'm a foreigner living in Britain and I'm pretty sure the national sport is actually *bragging* about how good you are at queuing.  Most of the Brits I meet are very good at talking about their queuing skills, but those skills are nowhere to be seen as soon as the train pulls in to the station.", "Yeah well there\u2019s a time and a place for everything and no one wants to wait for the display for self important I\u2019m in such a hurry and so important struts out of the station.", "NTA.\n\nYou did not overreact.\n\nIn fact, under such circumstances, it is socially acceptable etiquette to punch his nethers so hard they end up spooning with his tonsils.\n\nHe and his wife are entitled prats.", "INFO: did they go to the back of the line after?", "NTA, and welcome to traveling in Italy", "NTA way to stand your ground. You called them out and they doubled-down on their rudeness with physical intimidation.", "NTA. He was banking on you backing down and you called his bluff.", "NTA", "NTA, but why escalate the situation? Proving a point? Enforcing karma?\n\nLike, if the dude was crazy, and a fight ensued, both you and him would miss your ride... so I question if the risk out weighed the reward.", "Fake", "I literally think that this is the work God wants us to do. As a Christian, I am my brother's keeper and our job is to prepare the way for God's Kingdom on Earth. Part of that work is challenging people who act badly toward others. If the behavior is criminal, the police can deal with them. But if their behavior is merely toxic and antisocial, the collective can deal with them through confrontation, shunning, side eye, and prayer. \n\nGod gave us freedom of choice to sin or be virtuous, but that doesn't mean we have to passively put up with other people's shitty choices. NTA", "YTA - you have an assigned seat, who cares when you get on the plane??", "YTA. I mean, not really an a-hole, but annoying. Who cares. I feel like the benefit is boarding later, so I don\u2019t have to be crammed in with stinky people for an extra 45 minutes. Unless you have a little kid, or disability that makes the aisle difficult to navigate, chill out.", "Highest of high fives! NTA!", "NTA happened to me flying domestic in the US I was boarding zone 4 and this lady literally pushed in front of me. She was zone 8.", "NTA. Hell yeah.", "I\u2019ll never understand wanting to board early just to get there at the same time. \n\nStill NTA tho. Fuck that guy", "You showed them, good for you", "NTA \n\nPeople are entitled assholes at the airport and I think more people need to be called out on their crap. I\u2019m an airline Captain and sometimes I\u2019ll show up to the airplane after boarding has already begun and I occasionally get people who say snarky comments or won\u2019t let me sneak around them in the jetbridge when all I\u2019m trying to do is get to the cockpit and start getting the plane ready\u2026", "You don't say what airline this is, but if it's Southwest it absolutely matters where you get in line since there are no assigned seats and some people like to sit in specific areas and seats. \n\nBut even if these were assigned seats, these people didn't have any legit reason for jumping in front of everyone else and treating them as if they don't exist or matter. It's rude. They're TAH not you.", "NTA, but there are literally whole travel articles written about this for Italy. If queueing is Britain's national sport, then line-cutting is Italy's. You're technically in the right, but it's not worth getting too upset about because it will happen everywhere you go in Italy.", "NTA never let anyone cut in line!", "NTA.  I'm a huge supporter in calling outline cutters.\n\nSilence is complicity, and not saying anything sends the message that it's okay.\n\nAnd it's not", "NTA. You called out their bad behaviour. They were expecting you to back down cause they do this frequently.", "NTA. Traveling is stressful enough without this kind of aggravation. I hope you feel good about standing up for yourself. This dude has gotten away with this behavior for too damn long, it appears.", "Yeah.  Good for you!", "It's bloody heinous.", "Yes, this is what I was going to say - if you get on too late your carry-on may need to go in the hold, which is a pain in the dick.", "Well done.

I didn\u2019t bother to ask.", "If you're near the end, they can make you gate-check your carryon when they run out of room in the overhead bins.  Many people don't check anything because they have been the victims of theft in checked luggage; so, to them, it is a big deal to board sooner.", "It matters if you need overhead space", "That\u2019s when the rugby scrum skills come in to play.", "Those mfs", "This kind of thing is very common in Italy.\n\nI have almost gotten into fights with people waiting for lines at airports in Italy. It's like common decency go out for the window for some people and they push and shove and cut every chance they get.\n\nSo regardless of the nationality, that behavior is pretty normal (from a north american POV anyway).", "Yeah I can only silently stew so much.\n\nNaples is like ground zero for being pushed around unless you adapt.", "Seems pretty significant, because if they were boarding group 1 or had status, they were entitled to board before you.", "I feel if he was from group one he would have told me so and/or went to the front of the line and talked to the lady checking tickets if that was the case of priority boarding wouldn\u2019t you agree?", "Then it was on then to get up when their group was called.", "Absolutely, he definitely was a later group trying to board early"]}
