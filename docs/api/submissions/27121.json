I waited about 10 minutes for boarding group 1 to board while my group line grew to about 50 to 60 guests(we were boarding a Boeing 777) when a large man and his wife tried to cut in front of me as our group was allowed to board the plane. As the man and his wife tried to get in front of me I said \"Hey, what are you doing? the back of the line is behind all these people why don't you wait your turn and go to the back of the line\" The wife replied, \"What is the difference we are all going to board the plane, why does it matter where I get in line?\" I replied, \"Well if that is how you feel you should have gotten in line to board when everyone else did.\" The large man then said something under his breath and still tried to get in front of me. I said, \"Excuse me what did you say?\" He tried to intimidate me by glaring down at me without saying a word. I said, \"It seems you have used your large stature to scare other people but I am not scared of you, now please get out of line and wait your turn!\" Did I over react or should I have just let them cut in front of me?", "created_utc": 1695039467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ltzfh/aita_pushy_line_cutters_at_the_airport/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
