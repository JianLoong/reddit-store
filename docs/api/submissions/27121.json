As a Christian, I am my brother's keeper and our job is to prepare the way for God's Kingdom on Earth. Part of that work is challenging people who act badly toward others.

Same principle.", "NTA this internet stranger is proud of you", "In Washington State the car lines for the ferry have signs that state no cutting in line.  Since there is limited capacity for cars, if someone does try to cut somebody off, then their license plate gets called in, and they are refused entry on that ferry and have to wait for the next one.

I admire you. \n\nNta", "NTA - It does matter when people board, even in the same group. The further back in a group you are, the better chance you have of not having overhead bin space and being forced into a middle seat (or whatever type of seat you least desire). Good for you for holding your ground.", "ESH - You escalated a confrontation in the airport.  It was a minor annoyance.  I'm judging this way because I can respect standing up for yourself, but you need to be careful with when and where you do it.  This little tiff could have ended with you not boarding the flight if the airline personal decided that there was too much risk of this escalating.  Choose your battles.", "YTA for lining up to get on a plane. Just wait in a chair till everyone gets on and then you have no issues. Just walk on without waiting in the stupid line.", "YTA for lining up before your zone got called. N T A for telling someone to get to the back of the line. I wish airlines had a better way to keep people sitting until it\u2019s needed to line up.", "You may be going to the same place, but first in line get the overhead bin by their seat. If you\u2019re at the end of the line your carry on may be no where near you or worse if they run out of space, they might need to put in in the belly of the plane.

You were assertive and stood your ground without being insulting. \n\nWhere was the airline staff that should be handling this?", "ESH. This is why I hate traveling by air. \n\n1. People queueing that are for sure not in the section that is called for (let's say, section one is called for, I'm section two and there's a queue full of people you can clearly tell by their tickets they're in section four and five) and \n\n2. they still bitch on you when you cut line. \n\n3. Also the air-waitresses allowing people from later sections in before they're called for suck. \n\nJust queue when you're called for.

The line was super long and everyone had been waiting for hours to check in, when these college kids told their friends they could come cut the line and jump in with them. I told them absolutely not.
