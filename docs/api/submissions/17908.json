The details were pretty much kept under wraps but I was paid well so I knew it would be a posh family (ie ultra specific demands, being invisible when I\u2019m not playing etc). \n\nHowever it went very well and afterwards I chatted with the daughter of the couple for a bit (she was very, very sweet). As I was about to leave her brother approached me and the first thing he said was he never met anyone with a stutter before. \n\nI replied that I never met an asshole before and he gave an even snarkier reply (saying that it still hurt even though he was prepared for the punchline). Then he explained that he was just trying to make conversation and that I should be more thoughtful of what I say since I have all the time in the world to choose carefully. \n\nAt this point I did not care AT ALL and just walked away. \n\nThen later that evening he texted me out of nowhere and demanded an apology. I sent him a long text (tl;dr calling him a pathetic loser who only feels tough picking on people like me). \n\nHe simply replied \u201cwow\u201d but a few days after that I got a call from his sister saying that he\u2019s upset about our interaction and that I was unnecessarily cruel. She said that she\u2019s never seen her brother so dejected and that it \u201cdisturbs her spirit\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to say since it all felt super unprofessional and I didn\u2019t want to leave a bad impression either.

Lots of missing social skill between these 3.", "Right so, ESH. \n\nI'm going to be candid here OP, there's no indication that his opener with him having never met someone with a stutter, was malicious or mocking in nature. If your go to response with a conversation starter like that is calling a person an asshole, I'd perhaps introspect a bit on how you truly feel about your stutter. His \"snark\", appears to have come after you turned hostile towards him. \n\nHim texting you demanding an apology however, reeks of a self esteem issue on his end. Ditto for his sister getting involved. That being said, even here, your response \"calling him a pathetic loser who only feels tough picking on people like me\" seems wildly overblown given the context in which the initial remark was made. You don't know if he was going to followup with a remark like \"I find stutters cute, they make you unique\" or something similar.

I will not apologize because HE was the one that chose to bring up a topic that could've been very easily avoided\"\n\nTBH, he probably thought what he was saying was fine, as he probably hasn't met anyone with a stutter, but he needs to know that is NOT a topic you bring up, especially on a professional level.", "ESH  - he obviously needs some etiquette lessons, he was rude. \n\nYou could have said \"that was a rude thing to say.\" Or \"that made me uncomfortable.\" Instead of jumping to name calling. \n\n Getting to one up him is not worth the harm you can do to your business.", "If all he said was that he's never met anyone with a stutter before, yeah, YTA for going in guns blazing.

Never meeting someone with a stutter before isn't really an insult, but it does seem a bit insensitive to say; it's more of an observation. You *do* have a stutter, and he's never met someone with one before. He didn't put you down about it, and it seems like you jumped to the conclusion that he *was* putting you down for it and decided to respond by calling him an asshole. I'm not going to say that's something he *should* come right out the gates with, hence why I'm saying ESH, but to me it seems like what he said was a neutral comment. \n\nYou've lived with it for what I presume is a long time, and I'm also assuming you've been bullied for it before? I can see how you may view the stutter as a very negative thing in your life and as something that can make socializing or being in public challenging on the day-to-day, but to him he *doesn't* have this perspective; I'm willing to bet it's just a thing to him. I can see how you'd be on edge and how you would perceive what he was saying as an insult, with all that in mind. I'd be on edge about it too and I'd be conditioned to take any mention of it as intended as an insult if it came from a stranger out of the blue. \n\nIt's up to you whether or not you want to apologize. I think it'd be worth talking with him about what you thought he meant by it from your perspective and experiences with your stutter and how it's impacted your life.

The follow up text (\u201cyou should apologize to me\u201d) and his sister encouraging you to talk to him are his desperate attempts to continue interacting with you. You can tell his sister that if his spirit is were really so disturbed, he would have apologized to you, but the fact he continues to contact you demanding your attention/apologies and then deployed her as a flying monkey just confirms he is either a bully or a stalker (or both) and you were correct to block contact.", "NTA - But why are you still communicating with these people?

When taken by surprise it is very difficult to articulate adequate response - even without a stutter. With it, it\u2019s practically impossible.", "putting my reply to the whole chain here... because i think i mostly align here.\n\nUnfortunately ... should she HAVE to put up with it no.. but in private business there generally isnt a dont (uk train analogy) \"dont take it out on our f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* staff\" regulation, many people in many industries put up with verbal abuse from bad customers because its often politically easier for the business to be diplomatic or risk losing business... in my own comment somewhere i have pointed this out too... but because she IS her own business its entirely up to her whether its right or wrong to talk back to a customer, honestly will it affect her business in any major way? well that will depend on word of mouth and current reputaion and people should recognise that.\n\nThat said not sure how i feel about the neuro-divergent part... sister didnt try and defend him in that way, he doesnt get that pass, and would STILL have to learn as a adult unless someone is going to be there to defend him every hour of every day... My parents were bullied by a neighbour for years who didnt seem to understand no, after 15 years this family came out of the woodwork and claimed he had aspergers, now thats fine, but it doesnt mean they didnt have 15 years of harsssment due to this person. I have friends with aspergers, they were never anywhere near as bad as him.", "My first thought was he may be neurodivergent.  Then again met quite a few guys in my life that are just inappropriate.", "It\u2019s bewildering how every time anyone tries to explain someone\u2019s behavior here people freak out with \u201ctHaT dOeSnT jUsTiFy iT dOnT mAkE eXcUsEs\u201d like bruh, no one did. It\u2019s important to know why people do the things they do.", "Yeah, but it's reddit, where if you allow for another option you must actually be saying that's the case.\n\nTo me, it probably was a spoiled rich kid was being an ass, but I've known people from all walks of life, and everyone has different social capabilities. But it's AITA and one must always assume the absolute worst of people. It's unofficial Rule #15.", "Holy shit RIP your son, I hope he doesn't like traveling or live theater or shirts than cover your belly lol. I almost know his pain and at least with tall people it is less mockery than with short people but yeah it still sucks", ">I got in-school suspension sooooo many times because I would literally just bite the kids who made fun of it.\n\nI'm old enough my suspension was out of school. \ud83d\ude02 Biting them would have saved my knuckles and my manicure.", "Or \u201cthat\u2019s something you\u2019re never going to need to know.\u201d", "My standard response when asked if I can have sex is, \u201cWhy? Are you propositioning me?\u201d", "I'm insatiably curious about people (and a bit dense socially), and even I realized that being curious and/or \"tactful\" doesn't justify shit. And I managed it just by thinking through how that conversation would actually go.\n\nPlus, if I want to satisfy my curiosity, search engine. Pretty easily to find medical info *and* blog-type stuff. Boom, curiosity sated.\n\nSorry you've had to deal with that insensitivity. Boundaries can be... a hassle, to put it simply.\n\nEdit: Oh, I don't mean to minimize that behavior as simply curiosity. Some of those examples the previous commenter gave sounded downright malicious, I don't want to invalidate that.", "I am so sorry that people assume that civility does not apply to you because you are in a wheelchair. Just appalling.", "I agree. The fact that he can\u2019t move past this short exchange of unpleasantries is odd. How old is the brother?", "Agreed. How dare the help stand up to him! \n\nOP, NTA.", "As a ND person myself, thank you!", "Hell yeah!", "RIP?  His son is alive, just tall.", "Oh, we had out-of-school suspension as well but I think the assistant principal felt bad for me because it's not like many people were doing anything about the bullying. \n\nI didn't have manicures but I was big on open-handed smacks to the head as well.", "I had someone ask me something like this once, (the can you have sex bit.), and I thought like you \"Why? Are you propositioning me? and then thought of something better much more jerky like I am to jerks and said \"Depends, what are you hoping to pay for a night you'll never forget?\" They walked away very red in the face. Then I called after them and in front of everyone else \"Remember to get some extra 20s from the ATM if you still want party hardy later, I'll be waitin'\" and they couldn't leave the room/party fast enough. Funny enough they weren't seen at the next few, not sure if not invited back or just opted out but they still avoid me. I win.", "Wow, you\u2019re the exact opposite of an asshole. A perfect 180\u00b0!! :)", "I meant RIP as in that sucks especially with the things I listed. Have you never heard RIP used that way?", "Nope, first time.  Thanks for explaining."]}
