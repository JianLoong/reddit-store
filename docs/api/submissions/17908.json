Lots of missing social skill between these 3.", "Right so, ESH. \n\nI'm going to be candid here OP, there's no indication that his opener with him having never met someone with a stutter, was malicious or mocking in nature. If your go to response with a conversation starter like that is calling a person an asshole, I'd perhaps introspect a bit on how you truly feel about your stutter. His \"snark\", appears to have come after you turned hostile towards him. \n\nHim texting you demanding an apology however, reeks of a self esteem issue on his end. Ditto for his sister getting involved. That being said, even here, your response \"calling him a pathetic loser who only feels tough picking on people like me\" seems wildly overblown given the context in which the initial remark was made. You don't know if he was going to followup with a remark like \"I find stutters cute, they make you unique\" or something similar.

I will not apologize because HE was the one that chose to bring up a topic that could've been very easily avoided\"\n\nTBH, he probably thought what he was saying was fine, as he probably hasn't met anyone with a stutter, but he needs to know that is NOT a topic you bring up, especially on a professional level.", "ESH  - he obviously needs some etiquette lessons, he was rude. \n\nYou could have said \"that was a rude thing to say.\" Or \"that made me uncomfortable.\" Instead of jumping to name calling. \n\n Getting to one up him is not worth the harm you can do to your business.", "If all he said was that he's never met anyone with a stutter before, yeah, YTA for going in guns blazing.

Barring that, you could have chosen to kindly and gently provide an explanation that it's not acceptable to point out one' s disability, but you didn't.\n\nHe wasn't attempting to insult you.  He was attempting to strike up a conversation. You went scorched Earth on him because he isn't good at small talk, and that's on you.\n\nYTA", "ESH. Never meeting someone with a stutter before isn't really an insult, but it does seem a bit insensitive to say; it's more of an observation. You *do* have a stutter, and he's never met someone with one before. He didn't put you down about it, and it seems like you jumped to the conclusion that he *was* putting you down for it and decided to respond by calling him an asshole. I'm not going to say that's something he *should* come right out the gates with, hence why I'm saying ESH, but to me it seems like what he said was a neutral comment. \n\nYou've lived with it for what I presume is a long time, and I'm also assuming you've been bullied for it before? I can see how you may view the stutter as a very negative thing in your life and as something that can make socializing or being in public challenging on the day-to-day, but to him he *doesn't* have this perspective; I'm willing to bet it's just a thing to him. I can see how you'd be on edge and how you would perceive what he was saying as an insult, with all that in mind. I'd be on edge about it too and I'd be conditioned to take any mention of it as intended as an insult if it came from a stranger out of the blue. \n\nIt's up to you whether or not you want to apologize. I think it'd be worth talking with him about what you thought he meant by it from your perspective and experiences with your stutter and how it's impacted your life.

The follow up text (\u201cyou should apologize to me\u201d) and his sister encouraging you to talk to him are his desperate attempts to continue interacting with you. You can tell his sister that if his spirit is were really so disturbed, he would have apologized to you, but the fact he continues to contact you demanding your attention/apologies and then deployed her as a flying monkey just confirms he is either a bully or a stalker (or both) and you were correct to block contact.", "NTA - But why are you still communicating with these people? The job is over just ignore any future correspondence. You are not obligated to talk it out. It's very odd to me this is still going on. Why is the sister texting you about a convo with her brother?

Clearly he was out of line and I didn\u2019t think your response was out of line and the fact that he doubled down on it only shows your response was not out of line.  What disturbs me is that technically you were employed in his house when he made these comments to you, not sure about his age but he needs to know that not only you do not talk to people like that but especially if they are in your employment.
