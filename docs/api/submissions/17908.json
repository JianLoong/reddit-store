Lots of missing social skill between these 3.", "Right so, ESH. \n\nI'm going to be candid here OP, there's no indication that his opener with him having never met someone with a stutter, was malicious or mocking in nature. If your go to response with a conversation starter like that is calling a person an asshole, I'd perhaps introspect a bit on how you truly feel about your stutter. His \"snark\", appears to have come after you turned hostile towards him. \n\nHim texting you demanding an apology however, reeks of a self esteem issue on his end. Ditto for his sister getting involved. That being said, even here, your response \"calling him a pathetic loser who only feels tough picking on people like me\" seems wildly overblown given the context in which the initial remark was made. You don't know if he was going to followup with a remark like \"I find stutters cute, they make you unique\" or something similar.

I will not apologize because HE was the one that chose to bring up a topic that could've been very easily avoided\"\n\nTBH, he probably thought what he was saying was fine, as he probably hasn't met anyone with a stutter, but he needs to know that is NOT a topic you bring up, especially on a professional level.", "ESH  - he obviously needs some etiquette lessons, he was rude. \n\nYou could have said \"that was a rude thing to say.\" Or \"that made me uncomfortable.\" Instead of jumping to name calling. \n\n Getting to one up him is not worth the harm you can do to your business.", "If all he said was that he's never met anyone with a stutter before, yeah, YTA for going in guns blazing.

You know you can't control people, but you can control how you choose to react to them.  \n\nYou could have chosen to acknowledge his awkward comment without hostility, but you didn't.  Barring that, you could have chosen to kindly and gently provide an explanation that it's not acceptable to point out one' s disability, but you didn't.\n\nHe wasn't attempting to insult you.  He was attempting to strike up a conversation. You went scorched Earth on him because he isn't good at small talk, and that's on you.\n\nYTA", "ESH. Never meeting someone with a stutter before isn't really an insult, but it does seem a bit insensitive to say; it's more of an observation. You *do* have a stutter, and he's never met someone with one before. He didn't put you down about it, and it seems like you jumped to the conclusion that he *was* putting you down for it and decided to respond by calling him an asshole. I'm not going to say that's something he *should* come right out the gates with, hence why I'm saying ESH, but to me it seems like what he said was a neutral comment. \n\nYou've lived with it for what I presume is a long time, and I'm also assuming you've been bullied for it before? I can see how you may view the stutter as a very negative thing in your life and as something that can make socializing or being in public challenging on the day-to-day, but to him he *doesn't* have this perspective; I'm willing to bet it's just a thing to him. I can see how you'd be on edge and how you would perceive what he was saying as an insult, with all that in mind. I'd be on edge about it too and I'd be conditioned to take any mention of it as intended as an insult if it came from a stranger out of the blue. \n\nIt's up to you whether or not you want to apologize. I think it'd be worth talking with him about what you thought he meant by it from your perspective and experiences with your stutter and how it's impacted your life.

The follow up text (\u201cyou should apologize to me\u201d) and his sister encouraging you to talk to him are his desperate attempts to continue interacting with you. You can tell his sister that if his spirit is were really so disturbed, he would have apologized to you, but the fact he continues to contact you demanding your attention/apologies and then deployed her as a flying monkey just confirms he is either a bully or a stalker (or both) and you were correct to block contact.", "NTA - But why are you still communicating with these people? The job is over just ignore any future correspondence. You are not obligated to talk it out. It's very odd to me this is still going on. Why is the sister texting you about a convo with her brother?

Clearly he was out of line and I didn\u2019t think your response was out of line and the fact that he doubled down on it only shows your response was not out of line.  What disturbs me is that technically you were employed in his house when he made these comments to you, not sure about his age but he needs to know that not only you do not talk to people like that but especially if they are in your employment.  This is a life lesson for him and if it was me I would tell the sister you are open to talk but would not initiate a call.  On him to reach out to apologize and there better be an apology.", "NTA.

Nobody can blame you for reacting the way that you did, but based on how you describe the interaction it sounds like he started off as an idiot, you immediately escalated the situation and him being an idiot kid immediately went to schoolyard insult defense mode.", "Not your job to school ignorant people.", "I'm actually gonna say YTA. From your account, he wasn't being rude or offensive, so your response of calling him an aashole was unwarranted.", "24M here , i also have a severe stutter.\n\n Im gonna be the minority and say you were the AH in this case. I've had tons of people say I've never met anyone with a stutter and I don't get offended , I use it as a way to make conversation as some (most) aren't trying to be rude , they're genuinely curious and interested", "NTA", "The forum is AITA, so NTA, but it wasn\u2019t a great professional move. Putting it into text was even worse. Don\u2019t do that in the future, in general. They could post it on a review and it could hurt your business.", "NTA. While unprofessional, he started it by rudely commenting on your disability. When he further pressed by texting you (???), that was inappropriate. Hopefully you can strike this family from your list of clients.\n\nWhile you're not in the US, our current president Joe Biden has a stutter. After a lifetime of public speaking it's less apparent, but he serves as an example of a major public figure with a stutter.", "NTA, but personally I'd turn the other cheek on the \"never met anyone with a stutter before\". That's shortsighted and ignorant, but I don't think it's meant with malicious intent. People I meet ask me dumb questions about my vitiligo all the time, not realising that I'm sick and tired of the reminder that this is the first they notice when they meet me, and I just kind of sigh and answer politely. You calling him an asshole back is unnecessary imo.\n\nBut after he says \"all the time to prepare\", I'd say it's open season, you can go HAM on someone who says that. He turned out to be an asshole after all.", "So there is a book called White fragility which talks about how white people respond to being called out as racist.

Your answer was way out of line, and I\u2019m saying this as someone who works for customer service and has heard and witnessed some very ugly things.

As a fellow musician, these aren\u2019t bridges you want to burn and there are more respectful ways of correcting someone than rudely calling them an ass. Unfortunately it\u2019s part of the job, and he quite literally said he\u2019s never met someone with a stutter. Even without that information your initial reaction was wildly unprofessional and I know in my town I would never get offered gigs from that coordinator again. I wouldn\u2019t recommend behaving like this at another gig, and I would consider apologizing for your reaction while explaining his  comment\u2019s impact. Not saying to coddle, I am saying be professional.", "NTA\n\nIt's not appropriate to bring that up. If that was my brother I'd tell him that HE needs to apologize.

I'm pressuming she's perhaps defensive about it, because she's had to put up with a lot of bullying around it. Which is sad in itself. His statement was not exactly a smart opening line to someone you haven't even met, but was not necessarily meant to wound.\n\n\nI think she perhaps jumped the gun a bit. He should have taken the hint and just apologised for upsetting her though. It never needed to go this far. It's possible to apologise for causing upset, without admitting it was the intention.\n\n\nThey are both young, and have some learning to do on that front.", "This is the answer.

This feels like the most unprofessional and unboundaried situation imaginable. \n\nI have worked so many jobs where I was spoken to poorly, cursed at, etc. and I cannot imagine ever calling someone an asshole in the context of my job, even if they were 100% being an asshole. Seems especially reckless for OP since ostensibly she is self-employed and books her own gigs. Word of mouth is a real thing. \n\nAlso, why do the children of the person who booked you have your cell number? That feels like another strange breech of professional conduct. Did their parents give them the number? If so, that's so incredibly wrong and a misuse of your phone number for professional purposes only. \n\nOP, I get that you were thrown off baseline because this comment came out of left field in a context in which you didn't expect it. I feel like the only way to avoid going into fight/flight in a situation like that is to have a pre-written and rehearsed one liner you can just trod out without having to think that much. \"That's not an appropriate comment in a professional setting. I am going to head out now. Have a good night.\"  You protect yourself best this way, come out looking classy AF, and give people much more to think about when you leave. \n\nThe fact that you continued to be unprofessional via text message when you could have simply blocked him is a wow moment for me. Usually time and distance allow perspective and enable people to take the high road. Instead, you pulled a Reverse Michelle Obama (when they go low, we go lower). This might be a thing for therapy.", "I\u2019m not OP and I do not have a stutter so I can only give my opinion, but in my opinion this was a very teachable moment for the brother.

The brother probably genuinely didn\u2019t know why it was offensive and could\u2019ve learned something from op.
