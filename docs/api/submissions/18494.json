This person may well have needed help, and if so, it would be better for that help to arrive sooner rather than later. And if he was passed out from/ODing on drugs...maybe still get that person some help? Drug addiction =/= worthlessness as a human being. You are right to cut this person out. There's something significant missing where her heart should be.", "NTA\n\nOverreacting or not, she just wants her conscious to be shush, and you're stirring that up.

The fact that she just told you that it wasn't a big deal? That you were making her feel bad? How do you think the guy on the side of the road felt?

Surely she noticed her because she walked around her. She didn\u2019t see me seeing them (I was still behind them). It wasn\u2019t busy parking. It was for off season beach (I happened to be there just for quiet time at empty beach) and if someone didn\u2019t help, it could have been a while until next person walk by.

You do unfortunately get used to seeing it, but **most normal people** still call 911 when someone isn't moving or seems like they OD'ed and need Narcan. I've called for people who seem very sick and needed medical or a welfare check, and have been lucky to have never seen anyone dead in public so far.\n\nYour friend sounds like the type I sometimes meet here in Cali who see homeless people as a nuisance or as less than, and don't care /aren't affected emotionally when they see someone out there in pain or in trouble, and don't lift a finger to help, even if it's just calling 911 as you drive past.\n\nMeeting people who aren't affected at all by this, like your friend, deeply troubles me, and I steer clear of them. I advise you to take another look at your friendship and reanalyze any of her past actions that might be a red flag now. Has she shown a lack of empathy, even if it's on a smaller scale, in the past? It's one thing to look the other way when there's an animal on the road (I help them too if I can, to be fair.. bleeding heart and all), but not even bothering to call 911 when another person could be in danger, or dead, is worth dumping a friend over. \n\nImagine she's in a car with someone else, sees something like that, and ignores it.. and you later find out that was your dad or brother laying face down on the side of the road, and she admits to seeing it and doing nothing. I couldn't stay friends with someone like that. Even if she is desensitized from seeing it a lot, that's no excuse for not at least making a quick phone call. It costs absolutely nothing to care about other people enough to make a 911 call.\n\nAs for your edit, where she thought others would call, that's a cop out. In that vein of argument, other drivers who don't have passengers wouldn't see because they have to focus on the road and traffic like you were.

I always call if safe to do so.", "There was an instance where a couple saw a naked woman lying on the side of the road.  They got to the nearest phone and called police.
