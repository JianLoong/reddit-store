She is right, I CAN make a sandwich but it hurt so much to walk and i dont want sneeze all over the kitchen. I told her that and she called me disgusting and hung up. Later that day she came in my room and told me I could've made myself a sandwich but just cleaned up the kitchen after.

The point of a partnership is to be there For each other. A microwaved cup of soap or a sandwich isn't that much of a sacrifice to make. why does asking make you disgusting? If that was my partner, I'd be asking why the overreaction. A simple no would have sufficed.", "NTA. If you\u2019re sick enough to take a sick day and stay in bed all day, you\u2019re sick enough to ask your life partner, gender notwithstanding, for a little help. Tbh I don\u2019t think you should have had to ask\u2014yes, she was WFH but it takes maybe twenty seconds to ask a sick person if they need some soup or gatorade and about five minutes to deliver if they do.", "NTA.\n\nEvery time I have been in a relationship, whenever one of us was sick, the other did whatever was needed, including things the person would have done for themselves if they'd been well. Making a meal. Cleaning up. Doing laundry. Fetching drinks and medication.\n\nI once had a very bad gastrointestinal bug, and it was basically coming out both ends at the same time. (Sorry if this is TMI, but I need to set the scene.) My then-partner was in the bathroom with me, holding back my hair as I vomited, and then got me into the shower, washed the literal shit off me, got me back to bed - and then cleaned the bathroom, which must have been an awful job.\n\nThey did it without complaint, and I would have done it for them under the same circumstances. That's what you do when you love someone, or even if you're just a kind person.\n\nAnd then there's Amelia, who won't even make you a sandwich when you're unwell. Why are you even with her?\n\nThere's also the fact that whatever you have is very obviously contagious, so the less time you spend in shared areas such as the kitchen, touching shared things such as the fridge and the cutlery drawer and the chopping board, the better. I'd make a sandwich and bring it to my partner if for no other reason than not wanting to catch the bug they've got. Does Amelia want to get sick too?", "NTA. When we're sick we take care of each other too. And I definitely appreciate sick people staying out of the kitchen. She's OK to refuse, but expecting you to make yourself a sandwich and then I guess disinfect the kitchen? And no, as long as the caretaking goes both ways it's not misogynistic to ask her to make you some food when you're sick.", "INFO: How do you treat her when she's sick?", "You asked your fianc\u00e9e to make you a sandwich when you're sick.  I'm not sure I see what her problem was about helping her partner.  NTAH.  My wife and I don't WANT the other to be in the kitchen when they're ill.  Means less cleaning afterwards.", "NTA.  Seems like this was an unusual request and you\u2019re not constantly demanding sandwiches, right? \n\nIn sickness and health \u2026 most people  want to take care of their loved ones when they\u2019re ill.  And making a quick lunch while they are  already in the kitchen doing just that is the most minor of things to do to help. \n\nWhen you\u2019re healthy, this probably warrants more of a discussion. Is she unhappy with the current division of duties and are you two on the same page about that?  Or is this some kind of internet induced anger about men not carrying much of the household load?", "Why are you marrying her? When my wife gets sick I make her chicken soup, if I'm sick or exhausted from work she helps me out, it's a partnership and you should be trying to lift each other up. It had absolutely nothing to do with gender and there is nothing misogynistic about asking your partner to take care of your needs while you aren't well. \n\nShe's kind of messed up dude", "NTA. This right here is a big red flag! You aren\u2019t feeling well and she can\u2019t even make you a sandwich? She is not going to make a good spouse. Spouses are supposed to care for one another. God forbid you got cancer or something. You need to really think about whether this is what you want the rest of your life to look like.", "NTA. Sounds like you asked, not demanded, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for a partner to ask the other for help\u2014that\u2019s the beauty of partnership. If she was busy and couldn\u2019t then it sounds like she could have said no and you would have figured it out. If you\u2019d been a pest all day asking for help or asked for a ten course meal then maybe TA.", "NTA - you are clearly sick. She was on lunch and would not be a lot of extra to make two of whatever she was having. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda sad she was not willing to make you lunch when you\u2019re not feeling well. Would be totally different if you were just home with the day off", "NTA. Dump her today. If I ask my wife to make me lunch or vise versa, we don't even question it. It's not a big deal at all. Your fiancee sounds like a person who lives to be offended. I repeat: GET TO DA CHOPPAHHH  and get out while you can!", "If you guys were both down w the same thing I would understand her frustration. Or if she\u2019s been sick before and you\u2019ve not done the same. Else this is a complete overreaction", "NTA. Leave her. Cooking food for your sick partner is the bare minimum you can do. If you think that's misogyny, that's sad. What's the point of having a partner who won't be with you \"**during sickness** and in health?\"", " (NTA) - Maybe consider giving her the benefit of the doubt. She might have been going through something that caused her to react harshly. \n\nBut you're definitely not the asshole. It's kinda weird that she wouldn't want to help you when you're sick, especially when you would probably do the same for her.", "NTA  Think hard here....do you want to spend the rest of your life with a heartless, self centered, mean person who sounds like a man hater?  Wow, wake up call my friend....your life would be hell with this women.  Run!", "NTA. That's one of the reasons we have partners, to take care of us when we are sick.", "NTA- wouldn\u2019t she like it if you made her food if she was home sick? That\u2019s what couples do. Or even friends.", "NTA asking for help when you are sick, obviously so, is not misogynistic.  Does she actually know what the word means, or does she generally have a poor grasp of context?", "It\u2019s a surprising lack of sympathy and caring for a SA. I would imagine such a thing happens in an unhappy relationship.\nIs everything ok in general with the two of you?\n\nAs for misogyny \u2014 if you didn\u2019t say that she has to make a sandwich because she\u2019s a woman I don\u2019t see why you could be showing it.", "NTA.  My husband and daughter had covid last week & I made both of them drinks and food on the 2 days they felt kinda lousy.  It's what normal people do when people they care about are sick.  Your fiance, however, is TA for sure.", "NTA. Whenever I or my husband is sick, we just.. automatically do stuff for the other? \n\nI\u2019d make sure his water bottle is topped up, meds within reach, lunch sorted and then I\u2019d do my own thing and let him rest and vice versa. Even if we weren\u2019t home, we\u2019d order takeout for the other in lieu of not being around to sort out meals.\n\nThat\u2019s what people who love each other / partners do for each other.", "NTA! If I was the fianc\u00e9e I would actively be keeping him OUT of the kitchen so he doesn\u2019t sneeze/cough all over the food. He can resume meal-making when he\u2019s better.", "NTA. \n\nWill it be misogynistic of you to make her food when she's sick then? Hope she doesn't expect you to ever do anything for her... because she's obviously a strong, independent woman.", "NTA - partners take care of each other when one is sick. Tell her it would have been sexist if **she** were sick and you insisted she still cook a meal. #nothowsexismworks", "Yeah.... I would be cancelling the engagement.

Her reaction was absolutely over the top.", "NTA\n\nI had roommates who treated me better than this. Come and check up on me and make me soup or anything else so I can recover quickly.\n\nAnd here, OP has to call to even talk to her on her break time. And seemingly, the only interaction they have had is her coming to complain he could have made something for him.\n\nOP, is this the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. The only vague justification I could make here is if you treated her really badly when she was sick", "NTA\n\nYou asked you partner to make you something to eat at a time she would probably be getting herself something to eat too because you didn't want to enter the room you store your food in while sick. You weren't sitting on the couch playing video games. You didn't demand she cook you a full meal. You asked for a sandwich while laying in bed recovering.... She's the AH here for both getting mad at you and claiming misogyny because she couldn't care enough to help you. Throw her out, time for a new gf.", "\"Fiancee\"? No, do not marry someone who won't make you a sandwich when you are sick. That's the lowest bar imaginable. She may think she's standing up for herself in some kind of way - but if so, that just means she's stupid. Literally every single person who cares about their partner is willing to make them food when they are ill.", "Dang your fiance sucks. When my husband is sick/not feeling well he doesn't even need to ask me to make him something. I make him rest, with meds if needed, and take care of him just like he does when I'm sick. THAT to me is very basic in a loving relationship. If yall had a son in the future and he got sick and asked her to make food would she tell him to not be misogynistic?!?!\nNTA.", "NTA - if I am sick (and even if I am not) it is my partner's biggest joy to make me food - he would probably even make me a soup from scratch. Divorce her and marry the sandwich.", "NTA. But your fiancee is. You were in bed. Sick. Taking a sick day. She was at home working in another room. You didn't ask her to drive home to take care of you. She was there already and she probably had to fix lunch for herself too. I seriously don't get this.", "NTA. Yikes! I can't believe you even had to ask, and she didn't check to see if you needed anything. \n\nJust wow. There are partners who actually care about the other person and will help without attitude.", "NTA, RUN. That\u2019s so gross and childish of her. You\u2019re in a relationship and sick. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s just your day off and you don\u2019t want to move. If the roles were reversed you would be the AH.

Running to go make my fianc\u00e9 a sandwich right now", "NTA. Unless you have refused to help her when she was sick, she is misguided at best and an asshole at worst. You should probably have a discussion about expectations going forward. The whole point of having a partner is knowing that they have your back and viceVersa. \nLast month, my son (17m) drove across town to bring his buddy soup because he was at home sick and alone.

You were freaking sick, fever etc, and not only she could not bother to help you and make a sandwich, she played oppressed women card. Ykes. NTA", "This is nowhere near AH. Doing small things like that for each other is what should bring joy.

If I or my fianc\u00e9 are ill the other one would be right there asking, do you need and food, drinks, pain killers, blankets? We would be checking up and getting things for each other frequently.

It\u2019s not like you were off work and playing video games all day. You were in bed sick. That\u2019s not the kind of woman you want to marry.

Unlike in office, there is no canteen to grab ready to eat food. So to do both, you squeeze time really tight and might finish with your mouse in another hand already. So, if she cooked for you, even something quick, it means she'd be out of those 3 minutes she had to inhale her own food.\n\nYou had a mancold, not a broken leg.
