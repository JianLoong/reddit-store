We have an 8-year-old daughter with curly hair. I love her hair, and she loves it too.\n\nLast weekend, I noticed she was upset and quiet. I asked what happened, and she didn't want to tell me. I insisted, and she started crying. She told me her father had made a joke about her hair. He said her hair looked like a rat's nest and that she should straighten it or cut it. He said it was just a joke and that he loved her hair, but she shouldn't tell me about the joke.\n\nI was furious and confronted my husband. I started arguing with him and said he was being prejudiced and had hurt our daughter. He apologized and said he didn't mean to offend anyone. He said he was just trying to make a joke and didn't see any issue with her hair. He said I needed to stop dwelling on his mistake and that I was overreacting.\n\nI didn't accept his apologies and continued to argue with him. I told him he had no idea what curly hair means to our daughter and our culture. I said he should respect it and not make such jokes. I said he was foolish for making our daughter feel bad and for making her hide the truth from me.

Another factor in our lives - i dont recall the food comments but i did go.through an eating disorder and my sister drank to compensate for her alleged inadequacies; i wouldn't blame my mum as a single parent under fuck loads of pressure but actually what you say is so important to your children even if you dont realise it", "YTA.

We have an 8-year-old daughter with curly hair. I love her hair, and she loves it too.\n\nLast weekend, I noticed she was upset and quiet. I asked what happened, and she didn't want to tell me. I insisted, and she started crying. She told me her father had made a joke about her hair. He said her hair looked like a rat's nest and that she should straighten it or cut it. He said it was just a joke and that he loved her hair, but she shouldn't tell me about the joke.\n\nI was furious and confronted my husband. I started arguing with him and said he was being prejudiced and had hurt our daughter. He apologized and said he didn't mean to offend anyone. He said he was just trying to make a joke and didn't see any issue with her hair. He said I needed to stop dwelling on his mistake and that I was overreacting.\n\nI didn't accept his apologies and continued to argue with him. I told him he had no idea what curly hair means to our daughter and our culture. I said he should respect it and not make such jokes. I said he was foolish for making our daughter feel bad and for making her hide the truth from me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's why a birthday party isn't a secret, it's a SURPRISE. You can keep surprises . . . things which you are going to share with people in a few days or a week (but not indefinitely). But we teach kids that you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EVER KEEP SECRETS from your adults. There are no \"safe secrets\". \n\nAnd the reason for that is that if you use the same word (secrets) for safe and unsafe things, it can be confusing for kids. Because predators are often adults they know, and can tell them, \"Oh no, this is the safe kind of secret. You know me and I say it's safe.\" And even if it doesn't conform to the correct rules for \"safe\", it's confusing because the kids have been taught that \"some secrets are safe ones\". NOPE.
