We have an 8-year-old daughter with curly hair. I love her hair, and she loves it too.\n\nLast weekend, I noticed she was upset and quiet. I asked what happened, and she didn't want to tell me. I insisted, and she started crying. She told me her father had made a joke about her hair. He said her hair looked like a rat's nest and that she should straighten it or cut it. He said it was just a joke and that he loved her hair, but she shouldn't tell me about the joke.\n\nI was furious and confronted my husband. I started arguing with him and said he was being prejudiced and had hurt our daughter. He apologized and said he didn't mean to offend anyone. He said he was just trying to make a joke and didn't see any issue with her hair. He said I needed to stop dwelling on his mistake and that I was overreacting.\n\nI didn't accept his apologies and continued to argue with him. I told him he had no idea what curly hair means to our daughter and our culture. I said he should respect it and not make such jokes. I said he was foolish for making our daughter feel bad and for making her hide the truth from me.

My point is that small comments like that are lasting. My mother also said to my sister that maybe she shouldnt have more toast (she had 2 pieces and was going for another two) as she night get fat. Another factor in our lives - i dont recall the food comments but i did go.through an eating disorder and my sister drank to compensate for her alleged inadequacies; i wouldn't blame my mum as a single parent under fuck loads of pressure but actually what you say is so important to your children even if you dont realise it", "YTA.

Calling someone's hair a rat's nest isn't nice, but if that's the only thing he said, that's a common thing to tell kids when their hair is messy. IDK if hers was, in that instance, but he literally could have been commenting that it wasn't groomed well. Nothing in \"your hair looks like a rat's nest\" sounds racially targeted. \"You inherited that rat's nest from your mom,\" would be.\n\nThat said, you need to find out if there are other things that she's not supposed to tell Mommy.

We have an 8-year-old daughter with curly hair. I love her hair, and she loves it too.\n\nLast weekend, I noticed she was upset and quiet. I asked what happened, and she didn't want to tell me. I insisted, and she started crying. She told me her father had made a joke about her hair. He said her hair looked like a rat's nest and that she should straighten it or cut it. He said it was just a joke and that he loved her hair, but she shouldn't tell me about the joke.\n\nI was furious and confronted my husband. I started arguing with him and said he was being prejudiced and had hurt our daughter. He apologized and said he didn't mean to offend anyone. He said he was just trying to make a joke and didn't see any issue with her hair. He said I needed to stop dwelling on his mistake and that I was overreacting.\n\nI didn't accept his apologies and continued to argue with him. I told him he had no idea what curly hair means to our daughter and our culture. I said he should respect it and not make such jokes. I said he was foolish for making our daughter feel bad and for making her hide the truth from me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She didn\u2019t discuss it with him - she went in fighting and continued to fight. People like that dig their own graves in relationships because their partner learns they\u2019ll just be getting in trouble about things rather than having thoughtful discussions and coming to resolutions. \n\nI mean seriously - he said something ONE TIME. Kid gets upset (perhaps rightfully so) and Mom loses her shit and won\u2019t let it go even after he apologized. So I can see him panicking and asking her to keep it to herself. Not a great choice, but I can see where he may have come from.\n\nBut hey, I don\u2019t know any of these people and she didn\u2019t answer my question so I\u2019ve just got this tiny snippet to judge \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This seems to be the part people are overlooking.

It's not \"safe secrets\" vs \"unsafe secrets\", it's \"secrets\" vs \"surprises\", and there's a reason for that: surprises are time-limited, they're something that we eventually share at a specific time.\n\nAs a survivor of CSA and a former early childhood educator, it's actually important to teach children that there are no \"safe secrets\". That's why a birthday party isn't a secret, it's a SURPRISE. You can keep surprises . . . things which you are going to share with people in a few days or a week (but not indefinitely). But we teach kids that you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EVER KEEP SECRETS from your adults. There are no \"safe secrets\". \n\nAnd the reason for that is that if you use the same word (secrets) for safe and unsafe things, it can be confusing for kids. Because predators are often adults they know, and can tell them, \"Oh no, this is the safe kind of secret. You know me and I say it's safe.\" And even if it doesn't conform to the correct rules for \"safe\", it's confusing because the kids have been taught that \"some secrets are safe ones\". NOPE. There are NO SECRETS that we keep from Mommy and Daddy. Surprises, yes, secrets, no. (And even surprises are okay to tell/ruin if you really feel like you should tell Mommy or Daddy or you're uncomfortable.)", "You might find the book Respect: Consent, Boundaries and Being in Charge of YOU by Rachel Brian. \n\n(She did that Consent as Tea video). It's a short graphic novel about consent for children. And it tackles it in a pretty gentle way that is useful for all children (even to the extent of using nicknames as one of the ways consent is important) \n\nI think it would be very age appropriate for grade 1, especially with someone to guide them through it. (Or you could select relevant pages).", "There\u2019s so many videos and people out there just happy to teach.

She really didn\u2019t need to, her husband bulling their 8-year-old daughter should be enough to be classed as the AH.\n\nEdit: also the media plays a huge role in regards to beauty standards, unfortunately curly hair wasn\u2019t praised for the longest time.
