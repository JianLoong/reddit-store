You\u2019re treating her like she\u2019s less of a person because of **your** actions that resulted in her birth. How do you not get that?\n\nAs a fellow father, I\u2019m embarrassed by proxy. Parenting to me is about setting your children up for a happy life, to the best of your ability. How does punishing her for the conditions of her birth help her be a better person? What is the teachable lesson or moment? What did **she** do wrong?", "YTA. Wow so you and your wife supposedly treat her like your own but clearly not. Way to send the message loud and clear that she doesn't matter as much as her sister and deserves less because she has a different mom. I'm so sad for her.", "Obviously YTA. It's not her fault you were unfaithful with a deadbeat mom. That's on you.", "YTA. She is your daughter just as much as the daughter with your wife.

She is an innocent child, stop black-sheeping her for YOUR infidelity.", "YTA. You are showing favoritism and punishing the innocent party, your youngest daughter, for you fault. You stepped out on your family, and think that since the mom is behind on child support, you don't have to throw her a birthday party after she saw her sisters sweet sixteen? Yeah, that'll show her!

Whether or not your younger daughter's mother pays child support or not should in no way influence the way you treat the girl. Good heavens, having a dead-beat mother isn't enough?

To you, she's just a constant reminder of your failure as a husband and father. It's the only explanation that makes any sense.", "Of course YTA. You are the parent of both girls. You can swing a milestone birthday for your daughter. It's not your daughter's fault her mother is slacking on child support. Don't be an asshole, give the girl a birthday party.", "Huge asshole.", "YTA. \nTell her that she can have the party for her sweet 16, take a year to save up and maybe even open a civil case with her mother to get the due support. When you treat them differently all you do is increase the rift between herself and her sister. And if this rift gets worse, one day you may find yourself contactless with the younger one.", "YTA.  So is your wife for allowing this, but ya know, at least she \u201cforgave you\u201d.\n\n\u2026FYI she didn\u2019t forgive you if she is or allowing you to treat your younger daughter less than your older one.", "YTA- If you and your wife treat her like she was both of yours why she's getting diferent conditions for her party?

Coming from a daughter who\u2019s parents did the same exact thing, I can tell you that this will stick with her for a long time. She will always feel inadequate and less then. I am sure this isn\u2019t the first time shes felt this way. \n\nMy sister got an elaborate sweet 15 (quince\u00f1era) and I got nothing. There was a lot more favoritism towards my sister and I ended up resenting her for it. It really hurt our relationship, and it took me years of therapy to realize that it wasn\u2019t her fault but my parents. I no longer talk to them and my sister and I are very close now.", "YTA\n\nI feel so bad for this girl. If this is the way you treat this one situation, there is no way you don\u2019t act like this normally. You brought her into this world through infidelity and you have the nerve to treat her differently? You and your wife should both be ashamed. You can afford it, you just refuse because you both obviously feel she is less of your child. The only silver lining here is that she can obviously see past your nonsense. I hope she moves out as soon as she can, gets wildly successful, and leaves you both in the dust. You don\u2019t deserve children.\n\nGet off your high horse. You are not some savior to this poor girl. You\u2019re destroying her confidence and self esteem. Feeding a child and giving them a roof over their head is the bare minimum of being a parent. That\u2019s clearly all you\u2019re doing.", "YTA. You admitted you can afford it but are literally not letting her have it to punish her for her mothers actions.

It sounds like you have been doing this for 15 years.", "YTA - did you read what you wrote down back to yourself at all?

You had an affair while your wife was pregnant/recovering from giving birth. You probably (subconsciously, you don\u2019t seem particularly self-aware) feel guilty around their birthdays.

You should treat both girls equally.", "YTA\nThis is punishing the child for her mother's financial failure. It's not fair to provide such a celebration for your older daughter and not for the other.", "YTA. You are punishing the child for mistakes YOU made.  You cheated, and brought this child into the world and your life.....she didn't ask for any of this.  She has a someone dead-beat mother, and I'm sure you get frustrated with that.  But that is NO excuse to treat your two daughters differently because of squabbles you have with her mother.  You and your wife raise her together, and you need to now treat her fairly.  If the parties are too extravagant, then your 16 yr old should have had a more reasonable party, as you KNOW another party is coming for the 15 yr old.  To tell her it's too expensive is a cop-out on YOUR part, and that is wrong.  Give her the party and love and support she deserves...it's the least you can do as her father.", "YTA for sure.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter isn't to blame for whom you cheated on your wife with.
