We met 6 years ago in college and our relationship started off as friends, turned into more and we got engaged 3 months ago. I have known her parents and siblings for 4 years and have grown to really like them in that time. Especially in the last year when we got to spend more time together.\n\nSome bg on me that they learned over this period of time. My dad died when I was 5 months old after an accident at work. When I was 12 my mom died suddenly and I spent the remainder of my childhood in foster care because my only living family, my dad's parents, both had Alzheimer's and were in a nursing home together.\n\nBack to the main topic. Jessie and I got engaged and the first thing her family wanted to do was throw us an engagement party. In the lead up to this I met a few more extended family members who all seemed nice. Then the engagement party happened and things took a major turn. My name became such a big topic of conversation. So I hear them talk about how silly it is for a grown man to be named Bowie, and surely my real name is Beau/Bowen and Bowie is just a nickname, and how crazy and cruel were parents to saddle a man with a juvenile name like Bowie. Then one of Jessie's aunts asked me if I would be using a different, more mature and masculine name, in our marriage and I said of course not because it would not be my name. Then I got a bunch of questions from that aunt as well as Jessie's parents and two of her uncle's about my thoughts on the name, etc and whether it was a good idea to use such a name as a married man. Then asking if I didn't feel strange about a name my parents probably picked as a cute name for a baby but not a grown man. That's when I said they'd need to head to the grave and ask my parents, seeing as I could not speak for their thought process and how it might not be easy to get an answer, with them being in the ground for 25 and 12.5 years respectively but I'm sure my dead parents would love to hear their criticisms of my name. \n\nJessie was at my side the entire time and she was mad at her family but I told her to be calm and I could handle it. So I had said all this to them and I was cheerful and then I continued on as if nothing happened but Jessie's family were very uncomfortable with how I addressed them but I played dumb and acted like nothing happened. After the party they told Jessie I had been so rude to make them uncomfortable. She told them they had been judgmental assholes. I told her parents that I hoped they would understand why they were inappropriate with their comments and questions and gave them a chance to let it go. They said I was rude and had clearly enjoyed it when I played dumb like I did and I should apologize for making them uncomfortable. Jessie told them hell would be freezing over before I apologize for it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671101894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmidaf/aita_for_making_my_fianc\u00e9es_family_uncomfortable/", "score": 927, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did well.", "NTA- then discussing your name that you didn\u2019t choose is like someone being mad at someone because of their skin color.. it\u2019s stupid and yes you handled it amazingly!!!!", "The irony that they're taking about your \"childish\" name like playground bullies is too much.", "NTA. They can't be total dicks and make fun of your name and then be upset when you call me address the issue with facts.", "Definitely NTA - and cheers to Jessie for supporting you.\n\nNo matter what their reason, you parents picked an awesome name for you - wear it with pride.", "NTA I think it would have been totally appropriate if you had lost it on them, because they absolutely knew that they were being cruel, even if they didn\u2019t know all the details about your life. The most effective way I\u2019ve ever found to get people to stfu is to blind side them with a response they weren\u2019t expecting (my favorite is by laughing when people are being rude, few things derail ah\u2019s faster than that). \n\nYou definitely have them the response they weren\u2019t expecting, so now they\u2019re embarrassed that they looked cruel and mean (because they were). And you\u2019re fianc\u00e9 is 1000% right, he\u2019ll should freeze over before you say anything resembling an apology.", "Like David Bowie? What\u2019s the problem with that? I think it\u2019s awesome. NTA", "NTA. Even if both parents (so sorry) were alive and well and there who tf are these people? It's your name, you obviously liked it enough to still go by it...", "NTA. You and Jesse seem great for each other. You both have each others backs. And btw I love your name!", "NTA  - I feel badly that you ask at all.\n\nThis is REALLY a case of  \"if you can't say something nice then don't say anything at all\"", "NTA also your fiance sounds awesome", "NTA at all.  I wish I could have managed a comeback like you did when my teacher did the same thing.  One of my college teachers went on about how it would be completely unprofessional to use a cutesy nickname in the business world.  That \"cutesy nickname\" is my real name.   Yes, it can be a nickname for a much longer name but not for me.  It's my name.  She still wanted me to go by the (boring IMO) full name (which is NOT mine).  I don't think I ever got across to her that I'm me and not that other name.  LOL.", "NTA- glad you did that and have a strong woman on your side that won\u2019t take crap from her family about you!", "NTA. Oh no, their rudeness and crally behavior wasn't indulged and accepted. Should they take responsibility? Nah, lets blame it on the person we were rude to. That's better behavior.", "NTA you and your fiance are great and glad she has your back!  Hope you have a happy and successful marriage!", "NTA. I think you reacted appropriately,  they however were rude.  You didn't get upset and cave, you didn't yell or get angry, and that's what they were looking for.  I think they must not be used to people handling them with such ease. They owe YOU an apology.", "Nta. I suggest eloping and having a fabulous honeymoon.", "Is her entire family aliens? I just cannot imagine a normal person asking an adult to change their name, let alone multiple adults. It's too strange. Like, people don't change their first names when they get married.", "NTA - you and Fianc\u00e9 handled this extremely well! I would also input that y\u2019all could say that it was very rude for those to even suggest that your name should be changed, and if said people still feel the same at the time of the wedding they can either keep their mouths shut or not attend. One time dealing with this is enough.", "I love you two.  What a team!  \n\nThey were trying to see what they could get away with now that you\u2019ll be an official party of the family.\n\nNTA", "NTA - these grown people are making fun of your name??? WTF, that insane. I guess the bright side is they did not have any thing to rip you for??? Way to welcome you to the family.", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA. \n\nFirst. \n\nYou were being humiliated for your name.  THEY were rude, every single one of them that joined that conversation and didn't try to stop it or change the topic. \n\nYou responded, politely, to rudeness. \n\nThey should have been uncomfortable, even before you responded, because of their rudeness. \n\nThe apology here is owed to you, by every one that joined that conversation.  \n\nSecond. \n\nThat instead of thinking it over, realizing how rude they had been and apologizing, they doubled down and blamed you, that tells you what kind of people they are.  Their feelings of being uncomfortable should have resulted in self-reflection, not blame and accusation aimed at you. \n\nWhen you responded to this doubling down, or escalating of ***their*** rudeness by stating quite plainly that their behavior was not acceptable, and that you were going to give them a chance to be better, they again attacked you verbally.  \n\nThat's three times they owe you an apology here. \n\nYou were not rude.  You were handling a situation, where other people were repeatedly rude TO you.  And you did it well.  \n\nI'm glad Jessie sees them for what they are, and you two are a team here.  \n\nI hope you both know that it's okay to avoid such people, even when they demand attendance at holidays and parties.  They broke your trust in them.  THEY damaged the relationships here, not you.", "NTA. They were uncomfortable? Good. I hope it worked and they will not bring up name change ever again.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "THey said YOU were rude? They just spent a ton of time mocking your name, fuck that lol. NTA.", "NTA-  you got piled on for your name which was incredibly rude. I remember my cousin asking if I would keep my maiden name when I got married because my married name was \"the worst\". I was going to keep my maiden name but changed it out of spite and in support of my husband. Unsolicited opinions should be met with disdain or not be given the time of day. You handled it well, and Jessie is a keeper for her support.", "NTA - The best way to throw things back in idiots faces is to do it with a smile.\n\nThe art of turning a conversation back on someone is to do it with a smile all while shoveling crap down their throats.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell played", "NTA. I\u2019m so relieved that Jessie is (rightfully!) on your side - so often with stories like this on here, the partner picks their family\u2019s side. This is all so ridiculous. Are they gonna call their daughter Jessica once she got married? lol", "NTA, they tried to humiliate you and are just upset they failed.", "NTA. So they can dish it out but can\u2019t take it. Her entire family needs to get over themselves.", "Holy. Mother. Of. Moses. What. Is. Wrong. With. People??????? You are clearly NTA. If they wanted people to be comfortable in their presence, they wouldn't be spending inordinate amounts of time making YOU uncomfortable. They are complete AHes. Kudos to you for saying all that and not losing your cool!!!", "How did the in law not know about your parents? If they did they are the. A H", ">They said I was rude and had clearly enjoyed it when I played dumb like I did and I should apologize for making them uncomfortable. Jessie told them hell would be freezing over before I apologize for it.\n\nNTA.  This is hilarious, and you seem to have a good sense of humor about it, and I'm glad your fiance has your back in all of this nonsense.\n\nIt's amazing to me that so many people felt justified in ridiculing your name to your face, as though you must (MUST!) feel exactly the same way they do.  These are self-absorbed, insufferable people.  What did they expect, that you'd thank them?\n\nAlso - \"Bowie\" is an incredibly awesome name.", "What does reddit say in times like this? Oh yes, if your fiancee isn't willing to cut her family off, I'd suggest you reconsider the engagement. No matter how on your side she may be, this bs drama will follow you for the rest of your married life. NTA.", "NTA.  You are never wrong for pointing out someone else's rudeness, especially since you continued to ignore it until the dam burst.  You weren't particularly unpleasant either.  Great self-control.  Let your in-laws know that they will be needing to apologize of they ever want to see their future grandchildren.", "NTA. I'm so glad Jessie was right there by your side!!!! Jessie is amazing!", "NTA!\nClassic deflection.  They were wildly inappropriate and they are deflecting to say you were rude in response to their behavior in order to make them feel better.\n\nHer parents KNOW you were orphaned at a young age\nMocking someone's name is NEVER ok\n\nYour response wasn't rude, btw.  It matched the tone of their own social gaffe.", "NTA. Also, that is a badass name. Have these people never heard of the 'Bowie knife?'", "I like the name. Can someone explains why it\u2019s childish? It doesn\u2019t seem like a Tom vs Tommy situation. Am I missing something?", "Nta super rude. I'd lean into it. Make them more uncomfortable", "NTA. They were jerks with their comments, and you handled things superbly. Also, Jessie is freaking awesome, and so is your name. \n\nSide note: How is sharing a name with a giant knife NOT masculine AF (not that it matters, just pointing out the inlaws' stupidity)?", "NTA. They get to make fun of your name and try to make you uncomfortable deliberately but somehow when you make them uncomfortable by spotlighting their own bad behavior, it\u2019s your problem? Also how is Bowie not masculine? Are there a million women out there going by Bowie and I haven\u2019t met them? It is the trend of nb people to go by Bowie? Is masculinity in a name that concerning? Do married men normally change their names after marriage??? I have so many questions about their line of questioning! Please let us know if they explained any of this. Dying to hear!", "NTA and I love your name", "NTA. And Jessie has balls to stand up to her family like that. I wish you both the best, you\u2019ll have a blast. You\u2019re a great team.", "NTA \n\nIf her family had any manners, the situation wouldn't have occurred. The blame should be aimed at those who caused this, which is not you. You finished it and should be applauded.", "For being to \u201cbabyish\u201d. And then they go and have a \u201cBig Jim\u201d or a \u201cBarbie\u201d in the family and think it\u2019s NBD.", "His fiancee is one of the good ones too. Rarely do we see people standing up to their family for their partners. She handled it like an absolute champ!", "Right? It\u2019s a name not a shirt!", "> Jessie told them hell would be freezing over before I apologize for it.\n\nWe need a Jessie fan club.", "Exactly!  The in-laws are simply upset because they didn\u2019t get the reaction they wanted from their bullying.\n\nFYI:  your name is awesome OP.  Hands down my favorite.\n\nNTA", "They probably expect her to use Jessica during tje ceremony.", "Second that.  Bowie is an awesome name.", "Lol so I legally changed my name this year (due to a lot of reasons including an abusive relationship) and I have to tell you, the amount of satisfaction I get when people tell me \"I love your name!\" And I can reply, with a HUGE smile, \"thanks, I picked it out myself!!\" Is astronomical!!\n\nEdited to add their faces are priceless lol its a really good way to tell if people genuinely like my name or they are bullshitting me xD", "[deleted]", "Thanks! I love my name!", "Or it comes from the Bowie knife, given the life story of Jim Bowie I would be fabulous if somebody called his name childish or not masculine.", "His fianc\u00e9 is literally named Jessie, a nickname for Jessica. \n\nTalk about throwing stones in a glass house.", "[removed]", "Hear, hear! I'll make the buttons!\n\nI think Bowie is an amazing name! Sounds like y'all are going to have a great life together \u2764\ufe0f  NTA", "I would tell OP to marry that woman if he wasn't already.", "Can we have some Bowie Jrs please?", "Yes, I\u2019m in love with Jessie.", "Yes.  She\u2019s got OPs back.", "Agreed completely. The guy's parents are dead, his grandparents had/have Alzheimer's (not sure if they're still alive from the post and want to show the proper respect through tense), and he spent the rest of his childhood in foster care. I don't like putting words in someone's mouth, but it sure as hell looks like they seriously thought they could pick on this guy all they wanted because no one would defend him, and he'd roll because he's so grateful to have a family. It's beyond calculated in its cruelty. Talk about isolating your target.   \n\n\nOP, if you read this, NTA, and this was a test on their part to see how much they could get you to bend on things. I want to wish both you and Jessie a wonderful, long, stress-free life of planning your own wedding, decorating your own home, and raising your own kids, because you two just proved you're a team that has each others backs.
