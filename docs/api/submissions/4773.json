We met 6 years ago in college and our relationship started off as friends, turned into more and we got engaged 3 months ago. I have known her parents and siblings for 4 years and have grown to really like them in that time. Especially in the last year when we got to spend more time together.\n\nSome bg on me that they learned over this period of time. My dad died when I was 5 months old after an accident at work. When I was 12 my mom died suddenly and I spent the remainder of my childhood in foster care because my only living family, my dad's parents, both had Alzheimer's and were in a nursing home together.\n\nBack to the main topic. Jessie and I got engaged and the first thing her family wanted to do was throw us an engagement party. In the lead up to this I met a few more extended family members who all seemed nice. Then the engagement party happened and things took a major turn. My name became such a big topic of conversation. So I hear them talk about how silly it is for a grown man to be named Bowie, and surely my real name is Beau/Bowen and Bowie is just a nickname, and how crazy and cruel were parents to saddle a man with a juvenile name like Bowie. Then one of Jessie's aunts asked me if I would be using a different, more mature and masculine name, in our marriage and I said of course not because it would not be my name. Then I got a bunch of questions from that aunt as well as Jessie's parents and two of her uncle's about my thoughts on the name, etc and whether it was a good idea to use such a name as a married man. Then asking if I didn't feel strange about a name my parents probably picked as a cute name for a baby but not a grown man. That's when I said they'd need to head to the grave and ask my parents, seeing as I could not speak for their thought process and how it might not be easy to get an answer, with them being in the ground for 25 and 12.5 years respectively but I'm sure my dead parents would love to hear their criticisms of my name. \n\nJessie was at my side the entire time and she was mad at her family but I told her to be calm and I could handle it. So I had said all this to them and I was cheerful and then I continued on as if nothing happened but Jessie's family were very uncomfortable with how I addressed them but I played dumb and acted like nothing happened. After the party they told Jessie I had been so rude to make them uncomfortable. She told them they had been judgmental assholes. I told her parents that I hoped they would understand why they were inappropriate with their comments and questions and gave them a chance to let it go. They said I was rude and had clearly enjoyed it when I played dumb like I did and I should apologize for making them uncomfortable. Jessie told them hell would be freezing over before I apologize for it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671101894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmidaf/aita_for_making_my_fianc\u00e9es_family_uncomfortable/", "score": 6286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it\u2019s in public even better because their behavior is spotlighted with out you being aggressive. Once you ask be passive and \u201clet it go\u201d.

Yes, it can be a nickname for a much longer name but not for me.  It's my name.  She still wanted me to go by the (boring IMO) full name (which is NOT mine).
