We met 6 years ago in college and our relationship started off as friends, turned into more and we got engaged 3 months ago. I have known her parents and siblings for 4 years and have grown to really like them in that time. Especially in the last year when we got to spend more time together.\n\nSome bg on me that they learned over this period of time. My dad died when I was 5 months old after an accident at work. When I was 12 my mom died suddenly and I spent the remainder of my childhood in foster care because my only living family, my dad's parents, both had Alzheimer's and were in a nursing home together.\n\nBack to the main topic. Jessie and I got engaged and the first thing her family wanted to do was throw us an engagement party. In the lead up to this I met a few more extended family members who all seemed nice. Then the engagement party happened and things took a major turn. My name became such a big topic of conversation. So I hear them talk about how silly it is for a grown man to be named Bowie, and surely my real name is Beau/Bowen and Bowie is just a nickname, and how crazy and cruel were parents to saddle a man with a juvenile name like Bowie. Then one of Jessie's aunts asked me if I would be using a different, more mature and masculine name, in our marriage and I said of course not because it would not be my name. Then I got a bunch of questions from that aunt as well as Jessie's parents and two of her uncle's about my thoughts on the name, etc and whether it was a good idea to use such a name as a married man. Then asking if I didn't feel strange about a name my parents probably picked as a cute name for a baby but not a grown man. That's when I said they'd need to head to the grave and ask my parents, seeing as I could not speak for their thought process and how it might not be easy to get an answer, with them being in the ground for 25 and 12.5 years respectively but I'm sure my dead parents would love to hear their criticisms of my name. \n\nJessie was at my side the entire time and she was mad at her family but I told her to be calm and I could handle it. So I had said all this to them and I was cheerful and then I continued on as if nothing happened but Jessie's family were very uncomfortable with how I addressed them but I played dumb and acted like nothing happened. After the party they told Jessie I had been so rude to make them uncomfortable. She told them they had been judgmental assholes. I told her parents that I hoped they would understand why they were inappropriate with their comments and questions and gave them a chance to let it go. They said I was rude and had clearly enjoyed it when I played dumb like I did and I should apologize for making them uncomfortable. Jessie told them hell would be freezing over before I apologize for it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671101894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmidaf/aita_for_making_my_fianc\u00e9es_family_uncomfortable/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I might be an asshole for being so sarcastic with them and saying things that would put them on the spot to then play dumb with it. Perhaps I should have just let it go and addressed it after or let my fianc\u00e9e address it in the moment instead of me.

Keep setting boundaries it's the only way to survive the inlaws.", "NTA. Jessie sounds like a gem and I'm so glad she stood up for you. Her family sucks. Bowie is a dope name and I'm honestly kinda jealous!", "They weren\u2019t uncomfortable because your parents had passed, they were uncomfortable because they couldn\u2019t get a rise out of you or manipulate you by preying on your self esteem. They weren\u2019t used to it and didn\u2019t know what to do. When they couldn\u2019t upset you over the name, they tried to upset you by telling you your reaction wasn\u2019t appropriate. They\u2019re searching for an insecurity to exploit so they have the upper hand, perhaps unconsciously. They\u2019re probably not bad people, they just want to have a button they can press when they feel their power slipping. \n\nHopefully your partner sees how effective your matter-of-fact, non-emotional reaction was and follows suit. And hopefully her parents will see over time that family relationships with a mutual-respect dynamic can work too.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I just witnessed two mature adults setting boundaries. NTA.", "They got stung because you put up an electric fence of a boundary.    Even the dumbest animal learns that lesson and will avoid the fence in the future.  \n\nDo not apologize - they need to get over their embarrassment of being rude, which is why they want YOU to apologize - to take the stink of of their actions so they can live with themselves.\n\nNTA.", "Nope NTA. Her family had to keep digging. I think that was an appropriate response to people ridiculing your name. Seriously the nerve of these people. Glad your girl stuck up for you.\n\nI have an unusual name with an uncommon spelling for it. The amount of times people in my 60yrs of life who have told me I pronounce it wrong, or spell it wrong is amazing.

I wish you all the best with your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA, One thing that I found was useful when dealing with people like that is when they are rude and disrespectful is to call them on it. Hey x that was really rude and disrespectful, and can I know why you felt it was necessary to say or do? Make them uncomfortable and ask why they felt it was necessary. If it\u2019s in public even better because their behavior is spotlighted with out you being aggressive. Once you ask be passive and \u201clet it go\u201d. There is a reason they became uncomfortable, they realized they were out of line.", "NTA- These people were straight-up bullying you because of your name like a bunch of middle schoolers.

She is definitely a keeper.", "Jessie sounds like a keeper\n\nMaking comments about another person's name--and particularly speculating on what their parents may or may not have been thinking--is extraordinarily rude. That's true, regardless of whether the parents in question are still living.\n\nIt's also extraordinarily rude to make a guest uncomfortable by asking them to either disagree with their hosts or criticize their parents' actions from decades ago... But your in-laws apparently had no issue with being rude and making you feel uncomfortable\n\nNTA. Your statement to them pointed out, in a very restrained way, that their questions and comments were inappropriate and insensitive. They felt uncomfortable because you shined a spotlight on the fact that they were asking these amazingly inappropriate questions to someone they didn't know well enough to know that your parents were deceased... In other words, *you* didn't make them uncomfortable, their own behavior did. You just pointed it out", "Lol Jessie's family certainly has a lot of nerve. If they don't want to feel uncomfortable for asking asshole questions, they could always try.... not asking asshole questions. NTA\n\nMy one comment is, I actually *would* let Jessie handle her family. A lot of families like to tell themselves \"the problem isn't *our* person, it's just that guy she's with\", but getting called out by \"their\" person can sometimes be more effective. (Of course, other times they just rationalize \"she's just brainwashed by her partner\" so it's not *always* effective, but it's still worth trying.)", "NTA, how boring are these people that they have to hyperfixate on a name??", "NTA. Their questions and comments  were inappropriate and THEY owe YOU an apology.", "NTA they deserved that!", "NTA. I think you handled it beautifully and so did Jessie afterwards.

Yes. But I can't blame you for being a bit snarky/sassy. The gall of wanting you to change your name just because it rattles their bigoted minds.
