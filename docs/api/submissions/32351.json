Having group discussions, making actions plans, offering babysitting at different points for varying lengths of time all to give her the best opportunities to get her life on track. But every time, it\u2019s been a huge problem. Quitting jobs at lunch, asking for overnight babysitting just to go meet guys and eventually getting pregnant by one of those one night stands. Obviously she never even made the effort to find that guy. He just dapped and dipped. Or dick and dip. Whichever you prefer. \n\nI had to have a heart to heart with my wife and tell her basically that she\u2019s a lost cause and doesn\u2019t need anymore help. Let her fall. Nothing we can do at this point. So, we moved further away, she cut her off and so did the core family, kids all went else where with other family.

Unless she has some sort of disability this is ridiculous", "I feel for you.  I am 15 years younger than my sister and shes a selfish immature mooch as well", "NTA but your parents sure are for enabling her for this long. There is no reason they should have let her get away with not working.", "Your grown ass sister shouldn't be talking to a teen about her sex life. I'm sure she has plenty of gfs to chat and gossip with. And yeah 100% agree with you, she really needs to start acting her age. Definitely too old to be living at home and taking advantage of your parents at that.", "NTA. you told her the truth and she doesnt like that", "NTA. Yes, you\u2019re right that your sister is cringe and pathetic. But just so you know, \u2018girl\u2019s girl\u2019 didn\u2019t originate via TikTok.

No problem with still being single, but c'mon, I would be ashamed of living off my parents at 40", "NTA, and she should be embarrassed of her life at her age. No job, obsessed with tinder, and whining to a 17 year old all the time? She\u2019s a useless person. If she hasn\u2019t changed by now, at 37, she never will.", "NTA - You said some shit that probably won't be taken well, was there better ways to deliver that? Sure, but few of us prep that stuff in advance. \n\nSounds like a rough situation, if she doesn't better herself what are her prospects ya know? How many dudes are approaching 40 and want to take on your sister as a responsibility? The kinda guys that see that mess and say \"yeah that's wife material\" are the exact kind of people who you don't want to get married to. \n\nI'm sorry you're basically stuck in the middle of this, and I'm sorry to her that she seems to not be finding fulfillment in life. That's all any of us really want.", "Eh NTA, this woman needs a reality check and your parents needs to stop enabling her. Just get out of there as soon as you can and let your parents deal with her BS. \n\nI dont see any problems living with your parents, but most grown adults that live with their parents also work and help with the bills and chores. You are right, its pathetic for a grown ass woman to still behave like a teen and live like a parasite in her parents house. And no man will want an 40 yrs old deadbeat in a serious relationship, so if she doesnt wake up soon, she will end up alone.", "NTA - she has no obligation to get married or have kids if that\u2019s not the life for her, but she should definitely be working and paying her own way and should not be living with your parents. The only exception to that rule is if she was living with an ex and he kicked her out or her landlord served her a notice and she couldn\u2019t find a new place yet, but even then the living with parents thing should only be temporary until she\u2019s saved enough money to move out. But because your immature and brattish sister doesn\u2019t earn any money because she\u2019s a lazy freeloader who doesn\u2019t want to work, she\u2019ll never have enough to move out, she is a walking joke", "NTA, I think you\u2019re right. She needs to get her life together it sounds like. She needs to get a job and go to therapy or something.\nAlthough, I will say I don\u2019t understand how saying \u201cgirl\u2019s girl\u201d is immature. I don\u2019t think that phrase came into existence on TikTok, but even if it did, the concept of being a girls girl has been around longer, even if it didn\u2019t have a name. But that is a totally separate thing from her being almost 40 and mooching off her parents, cause that\u2019s crazy.", "Having assessed everything, no you're not an asshole. \nShe is 37. Whatever her lifestyle is at the moment, I find hard to believe it is pure hedonism and not part of a bigger problem that ultimately makes her more unhappy. But to find that solution and the true happiness that she deserves, she will need some harsh words. Family is most likely to tell her the truth because it's hard to hear truth from more superficial relationships, and unless she's looking for truth because of an awakened existential crisis, which it doesn't sound like she's doing- your words could start soul searching. It's needed but it's not easy. You have to be prepared to be the enemy for a while only to be thanked, if ever, later. If you keep enough distance from her, that's ok. It's hard to give harsh words to people you are more involved with because of the upheaval but I don't see why 17yo brother and 37yo sister need to be too involved.\n\nIt depends how harsh you say things but what you described in the post doesn't sound too bad. It's harsh but fair. Don't say more to her unless she confronts you and asks you to apologise or tries to change your mind. Basically she will ask you to admit you're the asshole and then this gets extra validated in her behaviour because now she's a victim. Be loving, gentle but firm. But other than that don't now keep harassing and shaming her wherever she is", "NTA. Some people do go out into to world and sadly fail (financially) and end up depending on their parents longer than they should. It\u2019s sad, but it happens. But like OP said not even trying is a bit pathetic.", "NTA. In fact you're the opposite simply for helping me feel better about my own life at 44. Thank you", "Eh.  Is your sister pathetic?  Yes.   Is she going to change?  Probably not.  Was insulting her really worth the effort?  Probably not.  I don't really know if you're an asshole, I just don't get why you bothered.", "NTA. Woah\u2026too many old ppl on here are pressed for you being young and saying girl\u2019s girl is tiktok slang. She deserved to hear it, she should\u2019ve reached that conclusion herself when she was 29 shes literally boomer age and still trying to talk about her girlies sleeping with men she has \u201ccrushes\u201d on like 37 is hella excessive.", "There nothing wrong with being single and childless at 37, nor with going out and hooking up with people or using old/new slag. But to have never had a job or have no plan for moving out of your parents house is unhealthy. NTA but maybe try and encourage your sister rather than criticise? It\u2019s not really your responsibility to do so, but it would be nice.", "NAH but you said in another comment that your parents may have neglected her (I\u2019m paraphrasing) she needs therapy more than anything if your parents actually want to help her. But you\u2019re a kid, just focus on your own life and do better for yourself", ">OP carefully describe how pathetic his sister is\n\nA-aCkTuAnlY \"girl's girl\" Is NoT yOuMnG\ud83e\udd13\u261d\ufe0f\n\nIs this r/AITA or r/IsThisSlangOldorNew?", "YTA.
