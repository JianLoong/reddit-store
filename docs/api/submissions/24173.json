Would you really expect another first row concert goer to switch with her? How is an airplane any different?", "NTA. There's been a trend of people that do this intentionally to get better seats without paying. Don't switch for anyone honestly. Also check the terms of your ticket.

They booked separate seats and paid for one upgrade.  He can give up his seat or stand up to her or book seats together.", "I know it doesn\u2019t make sense that they selected seating apart from each other or didn\u2019t ask the adjacent aisle person so they could at least sit aisle aisle.", "Oh ok!

At all.", "NTA. You chose that seat and, I assume, paid extra for that privilege. If you wait until you get to the gate for seat assignments you\u2019re running the risk of not sitting with the people you want. It\u2019s happened to me. Instead of asking people to move I sucked it up, put in my earbuds and listened to podcasts until we landed. Granted, it was for a much shorter flight, but still.", "NTA. It\u2019s clear she hated her own seat or she would\u2019ve been sitting in it and chilling. They clearly have saved money by purchasing tickets separately. There\u2019s nothing wrong with simply asking a person, but no is a complete sentence. I recently just asked a guy if he wouldn\u2019t mind switching (airline moved our seats and my 12y old would be sitting alone) but he was pretty tall and just said no, he purchased the seat for a reason and I just smiled and said ok. Another person agreed, and it was fine. If no one had, I\u2019d just tell her to deal with it. But no, you purchased your ticket and owe no one anything.", "NTA.\nIt\u2018s shocking that some adult folks still don\u2018t realise how this dorks: If you pay for it, you\u2018re entitled to it. If you don\u2018t, you aren\u2018t.", "NTA They had the choice to pick seats just as you did.

You are never in the wrong to keep the seat you paid to sit in.  I have to wonder who booked those tickets. He got the nicer seat and she got the cheap one. Makes you wonder if he was hoping for some distance on the plane.", "On one of my last flights, my girlfriend and I ended up with seats one behind the other. Packed flight. I didn't even bother asking. \n\nIf you want to switch seats, you need to be offering an upgrade. I wouldn't trade a window seat for an aisle seat for anything less than a full reimbursement of my flight ticket + more. \n\nFuck that. \n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. I hate when people play this fucking game. They buy the cheaper basic seats expecting someone who paid MORE for their Main seat to switch with them. No. I always want an aisle seat, even with my family, but especially if I am travelling alone. No way am I sitting smack between to strangers or being trapped by the window. My preference is the aisle and I freaking PAY for it to make sure I get it.", "NTA. \u201cThis is my assigned seat I booked and paid for.  You too have an assigned seat you booked and paid for, go sit in it.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThis is borderline harassment.\n\nNever had a situation like this happen to me before, but I'd be leaning towards informing the flight staff and having them take care of the situation.

Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.", "NTA, at all.\n\nThey are choosing beggars, F them.", "NTA\n\nThe boyfriend could have offered his more expensive seat to the person next to his girlfriend if they wanted to be together.

For one, I offered to \"sell\" them the seat, but that also shut down their interest.", "NTA. I always pay for the window seat on longhauls, and I'm going to sleep leaning on the wall. I am not swapping with anybody. Don't even bother asking. Especially not if you're a cheap b\\*\\*\\*\\*.", "NTA it should be illegal to switch seats as if something happened with the plane then the captain and authorities need to know that the customers were in there assigned seats.", "NTA and again you paid extra and they wanted you to give that up.", "Your not the asshole. If that couple wanted sit next to eachother they could of booked seats next  to eachother but instead they made it someone's else's problem by  asking them to move so they can sit next to each other , the worst part of it y'all she made such a childish scene all over this it's ridiculous", "NTA. You paid for the seat, you're allowed to say no.  Too bad she wasn't an adult about the situation.", "NTA. It\u2019s okay to ask, but very much okay to decline.", "NTA. I would have crop dusted her while you were deplaning", "NTA. He didn't give up his nice seat to go sit next to her. They are both wrong for bothering you and not just planning ahead.", "NTA. She's being passive aggressive, you do it right back. Push button, remove asshole. Every time. \"Flight attendant, I just want to sleep. Can you please have this person go back to her seat and stop harassing me?\"", "NTA!!! You are entitled to the seat you paid for, end of story.", "NTA \u2014 you can always ask, but don\u2019t feel entitled to other peoples seats. I felt guilty asking on my flight to Italy to trade with someone ahead of me. It was the same exact seat in every way except one row ahead. My friends got their seats all together randomly and I was the odd one out. I felt so guilty asking, but it was literally no different. They want you to give up a seat you paid extra for? Nah nope", "NTA; as a former T.A. : people buy your darn seats or stop complaining. No it\u2019s not fair how much they\u2019re charging but it\u2019s not the person who paid their seats, fault. I hate plane trips now. I use to love them", "NtA. I would've loudly called them broke.

One time two parents wanted me (aisle) and the girl in the window seat to swap with their 3 kids. The kids had the exit row so it worked out. Would have been made to switch anyway but I'll take the free legroom. \n\nAnother time I swapped to a premium economy middle seat for a $100 voucher on a red-eye from San Diego to Newark so refugee mother and their child could sit together. It was also shortly before Christmas. The gate agent asked me before we even started boarding and I was like, yeahhh this is going to blow ass either way so just fuck me up fam.", " You mentioned her age how many times.. We get it, you are significantly younger, whoop-dee-do.", "Agree with the NTA.\n\nNeither of FAA, EASA or ICAO says passengers are required to be seated in specific seat. Just that they must be seated in a safety approved seat.\n\nIt does however say that cabin crew, and in extension the airline, is responsible for the passenger safety. So if the airline or crew decides you will sit in your assigned seat for take-off and landing, then you will be sitting where they order you to. No discussion. If you don't like it, you will comply first, and are free to complain after the flight is over.", "I've seen worse things happen but no one would guess 45 exactly, multiple times. I guess the writer hates someone that's 45", "Man I wish an upgraded seat WERE only $300 more!", "Wow, someone is middle aged and feeling bad about it!", "You don't think maybe OP emphasized their age to point out how immature she was acting, despite being nowhere close in age to a child or teenager?", "because the behavior in question is fit for a teenager, not a full adult.", "You don't. You pay extra for more legroom, better cushioning, etc. It's all bullshit but it's not random seating by default. Unless you're flying Southwest, then you are herded into the plane like cattle", "Because for some people paying a dollar less is more important to them than sitting together.", "Controversial, I know \ud83d\ude09", "It\u2019s not rude, he just didn\u2019t want to. You can\u2019t be mad when a stranger says no to a favor like that.", "The key is a $100 bill. We had to book a last minute flight because my MIL was dying and I wanted to sit with my husband and baby. I offered the person a hundred dollars to sit one row ahead of me. It was a pretty good deal for her considering she did not have to deal with a 14 month old kicking her and squirming around trying to escape. She also ended up with the same amount of leg room and ended up sitting next to her mom. \n\nIf you have to ask, at least offer money. (This was also for a 3 hour flight, not 9 hour. I would have offered $200 or more if it was that long.)", "No, no-one is rude for wanting to stay in the seat they booked. What's rude is getting pissy with people for saying no.", "It's mostly because the problems with people wanting to sit together would be so much worse without assigned seating. Imagine not getting to sit together because your connection was late despite purchasing two tickets together. It's also hard to board by group if people don't know where they're sitting yet.", "Yes, because that would have gone well. Satisfying though.\n\nI literally can\u2019t imagine making my gf fly in a different class than me. (I\u2019m guessing OP was in first or business or \u201ccomfort plus\u201d or something?) When I upgrade myself, she\u2019s coming with! Especially since part of the point of upgrading, for me, is to make the whole process less stressful.", "OK, then tell them the correct price to shut up them.\n\nIts annyoing how such people are asking for favors not knowing about how costly it is.", "Lol. Not even close \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I mean, it doesn't really matter how old she is; she behaved poorly. If she is an adult traveling by herself, I would expect her to be sensible enough to behave herself.", "as well as variations of \"aita for not wanting to babysit nieces/nephews when they're randomly dropped at my door\" and \"aita for not wanting people to stay at my place while they're on holiday\"", ">\u201cis having a child-free wedding OK?\u201d\n\nYou can pin the answer \"having a child-free wedding is perfectly fine but do not pressure or expect parents of small children to come.\"", "Honestly I can\u2019t get enough of seat swapping stories though. Just something about the entitlement is so entertaining to me.", "Why would I bribe someone? It wasn\u2019t that important but it seems like people forget common courtesy on planes.\n\nIf something would literally change nothing (similar seat, extra leg room) I would 100% move and I have in instances. It\u2019s just common courtesy.", "Yup if you want to fly together you have to upgrade the whole couple not half and go hope.", "Honey, 35 is middle aged.  Don\u2019t know what to tell you", ">it doesn't really matter how old she is\n\nEh, it does in the sense that anyone past their mid 20s (and that's being generous) should know better than to behave that way in public. Like, I think it's one thing if a teenager were to act that way-it'd still be bad, but it can be explained away as stupid teen behavior. But if someone who was 30, or 45, or older were to act that way? They'd be acting way too childishly for their age, and there's no excuse for that. You can't say \"Oh, they're young and don't know better\" or \"Oh, they're young and still think the world revolves around them.\"\n\nEspecially bc she was affecting all of the rest of the passengers-to the point of being approached by the flight attendant multiple times-just to get back at this one person. Sorry, but imo, that's just downright embarrassing for anyone of any age, but *especially* someone old enough to know better. And I think the embarrassment is worse the older you are. Age does contribute to maturity-a 45 year old should, by all rights, be more mature than someone younger than them. \n\nEdit: spelling", "Though I do enjoy when they have twists and turns, like when the kids are \u201cdropped off unexpectedly\u201d because their house is on fire and the mom is literally on the way to the hospital or whatever (not a real example \u2026 yet).", "Too bad her man is too cheap to spend that money on her. She was petty as fuck. I'd have said many things to them both.", "They're allowed to say no every time. Sorry but people have seat preferences and airlines are charging extra for people to select their preferred seats.", "If it wasn't that important then why did you ask?", "Please tell that the next time someone is rude to you, works like a charm.", "Actually, 45 is middle aged. In addition, I'm not yet 35, so there's that. And I'm not your honey.", "Okay, I think this is a cultural thing. In my culture, once you step out in public, you are expected to carry yourself with decorum, and you are not given any grace based on your age. In addition, OP mentioned her age about 5 times, so it was a bit of overkill.", "You're clearly NTA here, but maybe their choice of seating was limited.", "Sorry, I know being in your mid 30s is rough, but don\u2019t deny that 35 is middle aged", "Most people aren't giving up an aisle seat, either.", "Yes, you seem like the type of man I avoid in life, so I will avoid you on the internet.
