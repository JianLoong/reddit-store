Would you really expect another first row concert goer to switch with her? How is an airplane any different?", "NTA. There's been a trend of people that do this intentionally to get better seats without paying. Don't switch for anyone honestly. Also check the terms of your ticket.

If you are too cheap to fork the money over to get a proper seat to begin with then you cannot complain when you face the consequences for your choices. \n\nThe only disservice you did was not telling this woman off for behaving like a child and not complaining louder to the airline that you felt threatened uncomfortable whatever by this woman's behavior and gotten her on the no-fly list. \n\nI agree with the recommendation to complain to the airline about her behavior and the flight attendants not getting her under control faster.", "NTA - this is a them problem.
