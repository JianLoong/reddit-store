There's been a trend of people that do this intentionally to get better seats without paying. Don't switch for anyone honestly. Also check the terms of your ticket.

But it'd be even more embarrassing for a 45 year old bc you've had an extra 15 or so years to reflect on your behavior and change it and you haven't; and extra 15 years where you think throwing a tantrum in public is acceptable and didn't outgrow it.

All I'm saying is people shouldn't act like the only reason some passengers ask to switch seats is due to last minute booking or being too cheap.
