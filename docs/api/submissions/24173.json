It was 9 hours long and I have work today, so I had picked a window seat so I could easily sleep the whole time to prep for work. After I sat down, buckled in, and got ready to sleep, a man (about 45) tapped me on the shoulder and said \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want to switch seats with my girlfriend would you?\u201d The seat was in the middle of the middle aisle, and I knew it would be impossible to sleep there. I politely said no, I\u2019d like the seat I had chosen. If it had been a child, I probably would have switched but these were two middle-aged people\u2026they definitely could have bought seats next to each other if they reaaaaally wanted to but instead got random ones and hoped people would switch.\n\nAnywho, I stay in my seat. The girlfriend (also 45-ish) proceeds to stand up hourly and glare at me from her seat several rows away. When she sees I\u2019m not giving it any attention, she proceeds to come over to his seat hourly and sit on his lap and talk very, very loudly, waking me up 5 separate times. It should be noted that the lights are out in the cabin at this point and everyone is trying to sleep. Flight attendants keep telling her to move. She persists.\n\nAfter the flight, we are deboarding and she winds up behind me. She\u2019s loudly talking sh*t about me for not switching seats saying I ruined her flight. I must stress again that she is 45. Her seat was in a much cheaper area than mine. They could have bought seats next to each other but might not have wanted to spend the money. The man revealed to me while we were flying that they didn\u2019t sit next to each other on their first flight either, so this lack of planning seems to be their usual move.\n\nAITA for not switching seats? I wanted to sit in the one I paid for that was in the area I chose, and I don\u2019t understand why a middle-aged woman is throwing a hissy fit over her own choice of seats. If it were a child and parent separated, I probably would have done it due to the flight being 9 hours\u2026but I don\u2019t think their lack of planning and choice of cheaper seats should have been made to be my problem. I don\u2019t get why I was in the wrong for wanting to sit in my seat. \n\nAnywho, let me know.\n\nTLDR: Woman (45?) bothered me (26) for entire flight and deboarding because I didn\u2019t want to give her my nicer/more expensive seat so she could sit next to her boyfriend.", "created_utc": 1691497669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lgt7p/aita_for_not_switching_seats_on_a_9hour_flight/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I will never understand why people do not plan every aspect of their journey.

It has become common practice for people to book their flight seats and then try and manipulate a change with other passengers for a more desirable location. Hell no!  You're right - they could have booked the seats together but they wanted to save money and try and strong arm you into giving up your seat.  I wish airlines would put an end to this by having a hard rule that NOBODY changes their seats.  Period.", "NTA at all. Not one bit", "NTA\n\nBut you could have easily shut her up when she was shittalking you by turning around and telling her \"i'm sorry mam, i only respect the elders from my family, not some random elders i meet on a plane and are rude\". \n\nShe would have been furios.

She is rude, entitled and cheap!", "NTA. The entitlement is strong in this one. I don\u2019t get why the swap is always a downgrade for the person being asked- if you want something from me, it\u2019s got to at least be like for like rather than something worse\nI\u2019m slightly impressed with the other woman\u2019s ability to hold a grudge tho!", "NTA\n\nAlso, you're legally obliged to be in your assigned seat for take off and landing due to safety (or, to speed up body identification) in the event of an emergency/crash anyway.", "NTA.

Not your problem.\n\nWhy do people stress over something like this. Tell the person no and stop looking for others to validate their decision.", "NTA. Funny how they weren\u2019t pushing either of the people sitting next to her to switch with her boyfriend.", "NTA. The two of them might wanted to save a few $ thinking everyone els will switch with them. Yeah, it is shit, that you have to pay for your reserved seat now, so you can sit together. But that is not your fault. \n\nIf you want complain to the fligh service about them - maybe if they do that often, they can get blacklisted (don't think they will. But maybe it feels better, to complain). Else forget those people. They are not worth to spend more thoughts about them", "Massive NTA!! I am a frequent flyer with over 200,000 miles and I learnt very early not to give up my prized window seat unless it is a similar window seat.\n\nThe woman can suck it. If they really liked each other they would spend the money to sit next to each other.\n\nAlso why is all this hate directed at just you, what about the person in the aisle seat? They could have moved. Also what about the people in the window and aisle seats in her row? If you do deserve hate (which you dont) then it should be only 25% as there were three other options they could have gone for.\n\nAnd if all the three also said no then wth are they upset for with you lol\n\nGood work standing your ground! Lets the dogs bark!", "NTA you are completely right when you say that you want to have the seat that you chose and payed for.\n\nJust as you said they should have chosen seats next to each other if they really wanted to.\n\nIt's really embarassing for adults to act like this after you declined politely, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. People shouldn't be shocked when someone doesn't want to switch their good seat for a crappy cheaper-fare middle seat. And that couple knew that, because they also could have offered the guy's nice aisle seat to one of the passengers next to the woman, if they wanted to sit together so badly.\n\nPlus, the woman's behavior was completely inappropriate. She was purposely trying to annoy/punish you by sitting on her boyfriend's lap (I mean, wtf?) and talking loudly.\n\nYou might want to complain to the airline about this because the flight attendants should have been more vigilant about immediately stopping her from this behavior, requesting air marshall assistance if needed. Disrupting flights can be illegal. The airline will probably throw you some extra mileage points.", "NTA\n\nHer actions tell you why he didn\u2019t book seats together..", "He could have switched to be near her and likely could have gotten a taker to move from the middle seats even to a middle seat on your side. They wanted a free upgrade.", "Of course NTA. The gf has main character syndrome and is entitled as hell.", "Yeah, that was my thought, particularly since OP was in a section where seats were more expensive.", "You absolutely should have said this to the gf.  \u201cToo bad he didn\u2019t pay to upgrade you too\u201d  or \u201ctop bad he\u2019s not willing to switch with someone in your row to be with you.\u201d", "Completely agee, although its bullshit to assume the man paid for the flight tickets or should spend extra money on her. She could have paid for it herself as well.", "Pretty sure there were assigned seats, she just didn't like hers.", "I assure you her hand was on my arm rest that\u2019s how heavily she was in his lap. I didn\u2019t wake up from the noise the first time, I woke up to her ring in my forearm.

Lol thank you for your insight.", "I would love to know which law you are citing.", "This is why this story doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThe person came to sit on the lap of the middle seat guy multiple times in the flight. That can\u2019t happen if the aisle seat has a person in it.", "Honestly, the 45 y/o woman was the mean one that probably was being a brat to him already about it and asking him to ask OP. He probably was like, \"Oh... okay dear I'll ask...\". So, I wouldn't lay the gun on the man that'll inevitably then lead her to start being pissed off at him later", "I would've asked her how much cash is she carrying, and for enough I would consider switching.  But it would have to be a lot.", "Sorry I should clarify \u2014 I was in \u201cUnited premium plus\u201d seating so it\u2019s just two seats. The set up is 2 seats on left side of plane, 4 seats in center aisle, 2 seats on right side of plane. They\u2019re the bigger seats that recline a bit for sleeping.

What type of seat did she have?", "This still doesn\u2019t make as premium plus comes with seat selection.", "She had one of the center seats in the middle aisle! So she was between two people.", "I did select my seat. She selected hers. He selected his. They selected seats away from each other and wanted to put her in my selected seat so she could be next to him. I\u2019ve attached link showing setup.

Some people need to get their head outta their ass. Also if they thought it WAS fair, the boyfriend should have gone and sat next to her and given this amazing seat to some lucky person in economy. \n\nAlso kudos for survinging United hehe I am gonna be a lifer on Delta if it was upto me :D", "I\u2019ll have to try delta next time!
