We were 6 and 3 when our parents got divorced. They had split legal custody over both of us, however, we lived with our mum. Shortly after the divorce, we moved from NV to MN due to the mum\u2019s work. I always kept close contact with my father while Bailey was more attached to our mum.\n\nAll throughout the school, I was certain I\u2019ll go to college after. Bailey, on the other hand, never wanted to keep studying and after she graduated from high school, she moved in back with our dad to his property in NV.\n\nThe property in question is fairly large and nice, if not for the fact that it\u2019s a former ranch in the middle of nowhere in a desert. You literally need to drive for about 20 miles to get to the nearest town.\n\nImportant mention: for my sweet 16, my father gave me his old used car. It\u2019s a mid 90s Chevy truck, but since dad maintained it in good condition and I kept up with the maintenance, it runs just like new. I still drive it and don\u2019t plan to get rid of it. Bailey also got a car for her sweet 16, it was a newer car, but she didn\u2019t care about it much and so the car was in a poor technical condition.\n\nFast forward to now, I graduated, I work for a big company, I live in NYC. Bailey lives with our dad on the property, works at a casino in the nearest town. Recently, her car broke down completely and had to be scrapped. She asked dad about taking his car and dad said no as said car has a huge sentimental value to him. Realising that she can\u2019t afford a new car, she started bugging me to sell her my car for slightly more than it\u2019s market value.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want to sell my car. Yes it\u2019s impractical to drive in NYC. Yes it consumes a lot of gas. But it\u2019s my first car, a present from my father. I told her I can pay the initial fee for her new car. She said she wants a Suburban like mine, but a newer one. I told her no because it\u2019s a very pricey car and she won\u2019t handle the maintenance. Please note that our dad is retired and therefore can\u2019t contribute. They live off his retirement savings and Bailey\u2019s income. \n\nOur mum also refused to contribute. She said she would give Bailey her old car, an old Camry, but only if Bailey flies to MN and picks it up or pays for the haulage. Bailey obviously refused this offer. However, they both are judgemental towards me because I refused to sell my car to my sister, drive from NYC to NV and then fly back and buy another car.", "created_utc": 1700904619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183g4cv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_sister_my_car/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No is a complete sentence. Mom gave her a compromise and she didn't want it let her figure out how to come up with a car payment on her own. \n\nSeriously who doesn't take care of a car? I make sure to do my oil changes and such regularly.", "NTA she was given options and refused them that aside she\u2019s a dam adult you do not owe her anything", "So you\u2019ve got a Suburban and a Chevy Truck in NYC?? You are under no obligation to sell but why you\u2019d have such gas guzzlers in NYC is puzzling. Whilst card have sentimental associations they aren\u2019t things you can lug around forever.", "If you feel you should get your sister something (I wouldn't myself), get her a course of car maintenance lessons for Christmas.", "NTA, I think at 24 years she should start doing things herself and not rely on family to solve her problems for her. If she took better care of her possessions she wouldn\u2019t be in this position. You aren\u2019t obligated to do anything. I would send her pics of affordable cars near her and that\u2019s it. No offer of money. She is an adult and needs to start acting like one", "Tell little sister welcome to the adult world...and a hard no on selling her the car.", "The suburban is the truck. OP only has one vehicle.", "The person writing this post is clearly British/European /Australian going by the \u201cmum\u201d, \u201chaulage\u201d, etc. but you expect us to believe you\u2019re born and raised in the US? I call BS. Either you changed the places or you\u2019re just a troll.", "NTA.  I had a car shipped from Colorado to New Jersey last year and it only cost $1,000.  If your mom is giving her the Camry, then $1,000 is probably cheaper than your sister buying your vehicle.  You sister has what my father used to describe as \"champagne taste on a beer income.\"  She needs to grow up.", "NTA. I thought your truck was sitting at the ranch and that is why she wanted it.\n\nNo way would I sell it, AND have to drive it across the country for her to have it.\n\nTell her to go to a used car lot and pick something reasonable out.", "NTA. Bailey has several options and they are all good ones. Do not let her guilt you for the one thing she wants.", "NTA. Why is this only your problem to fix? Your sister is an adult, she should buy her own car. Not take yours.", "NTA - your sister isn\u2019t a child, she\u2019s a grown up and has options including your mom\u2019s old car. They just see you as an easy target.\n\nThe answer should be \u201cNo.\u201d and then end every conversation from that point on about it with No.", "Nope. This car is yours.

She sounds entitled and just wants something that is priced beyond her means.\n\nInstead of acting entitled she should be happy that she was offered a car in the first place and since turning it down she should continue her stance on thinking she is grown up and buy one for herself.", "This is ridiculous. Her car is her issue. She apparently wishes to live above her means at your expense. NTA.", "This whole thing is the craziest thing I've ever heard. Buying a used car should be simple.\n\nAs bananas as it is to own a Suburban in New York City, the only dumber thing I can think of is for someone to expect you to drive clear cross country, a trip costing probably more than the vehicle is worth, just have to fly back home. It's all nuts.\n\nJust say no and be done with it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  it's your car, your choice.  I agree that your mom is a little hypocritical to expect you to drive your car from NYC to NV when she won't drive the shorter distance from MN to NV to deliver *her* car to your sister.  \n\nA great place to get a reliable not too old used car is from the car rental places.  Enterprise replaces their fleet about every two years and those cars are in great condition.  I had a former Enterprise rental car, a Saturn L-200, and it lasted me over ten years (probably would have lasted much longer had some guy not decided his text conversation was more important than paying attention to his driving).  They *encouraged* me to take it to my mechanic for a prepurchase inspection, and my mechanic was shocked to learn that it was a former rental car rather than some little old lady's Sunday driver.", "NTA. You're her sister not her mom. There are three years between you and you had the same upbringing. If there was an age difference and situation where you were a caretaker growing up or she relied on you in some way, or you were split up and had vastly different opportunities you still wouldn't be obligated but you may want to help.

If your sister were willing to actually actually PAY, she could buy any other used car. She plans on taking your car and never paying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo IF you agree to sell the car to her, make it \"Payment up front\". Or you will never see your money. And: If she buys your car, let her pick it up.", "My sister doesn\u2019t have the budget to get a nice and reliable new car, and she\u2019s scared of buying a used one because of what if she gets scammed or accidentally buys a car from flippers.", "Or a pair of roller skates.  Or a cheap motorcycle, if she wants to take that chance.  You can get a Honda XR150L off the floor for about three grand and change these days.  Those things were made for developing nations as farm bikes and urban commuters.  They can handle Nevada ranch country perfectly fine.", "Exactly.  That got my attention, too.  I think it\u2019s fake.", "OP's sister likes living on easy mode and making other people's lives harder, let's not get that confused with love.", "Too bad for her she should have cared and maintained her old car better.\n\nNTA don't sell her your car", "She can get a small Kia, or go somewhere like Carmax. Certified used cars are available at a variety of places. It\u2019s 100% not on you to bail her out.", "She needs to buy a certified used car from  reputable dealer with a warranty. She may need to work 2 jobs to pay for it. That\u2019s what people do when they\u2019re in a bind. They don\u2019t expect family members to drive all over the country to bring them a car, that\u2019s just nuts.", "She doesn't need a new car. Why can't she take your dad with her when looking at used cars? Sounds like he knows a thing or two about them.", "Ah. To me Suburban is an SUV and a truck is a pickup. Language language I suppose", "seems like she\u2019s the only one having a good time here. maybe instead of forcing her to be sad we should try being happy? \n\nConsider.", "Same.  In my brain, there are trucks (and that includes everything from a pickup to dump trucks and semis) and there are cars (everything else).  Make and model = red, blue, white, gray, black.", "Same. I only put two and two together because I have a friend with a suburban and it has a truck license plate. But it is definitely an SUV to me.", "Forcing her to be sad? By not selling OP's car (that they still use), driving said car to the sister, having to pay for her own flight back home, and then being out of a car until she can find an affordable one? The only one making the sister sad is the sister herself, you become a lot less sad when you become less entitled because you realise that people not breaking their back for you when you already have it easy is not something you really get to be sad about. Stop trying to encourage people to make their lives harder to make someone's decidedly easy life even easier, it's weird.", "jesus take a deep breath you gnome. why did you write all that trauma dumping just because I said that being happy is probably ok? lmaooo", "You must be a real delicate flower if you think me typing out what OP said at the end of their post for how the sale of said car would go is trauma dumping. Odd.", "Alright. based stance. \n\ni guess we\u2019ll see who has explored the full depth of Canadas healthcare system and takes the easy way out when the time comes.", "Have you smoked something crystallised today? Because your replies are giving me Forest Whitaker eye.", "now we\u2019re getting somewhere. I do not advocate for drugs kids, but they are very fucking fun!!", "I'll take that as a yes, my little crack pipe.
