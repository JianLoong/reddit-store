We were 6 and 3 when our parents got divorced. They had split legal custody over both of us, however, we lived with our mum. Shortly after the divorce, we moved from NV to MN due to the mum\u2019s work. I always kept close contact with my father while Bailey was more attached to our mum.\n\nAll throughout the school, I was certain I\u2019ll go to college after. Bailey, on the other hand, never wanted to keep studying and after she graduated from high school, she moved in back with our dad to his property in NV.\n\nThe property in question is fairly large and nice, if not for the fact that it\u2019s a former ranch in the middle of nowhere in a desert. You literally need to drive for about 20 miles to get to the nearest town.\n\nImportant mention: for my sweet 16, my father gave me his old used car. It\u2019s a mid 90s Chevy truck, but since dad maintained it in good condition and I kept up with the maintenance, it runs just like new. I still drive it and don\u2019t plan to get rid of it. Bailey also got a car for her sweet 16, it was a newer car, but she didn\u2019t care about it much and so the car was in a poor technical condition.\n\nFast forward to now, I graduated, I work for a big company, I live in NYC. Bailey lives with our dad on the property, works at a casino in the nearest town. Recently, her car broke down completely and had to be scrapped. She asked dad about taking his car and dad said no as said car has a huge sentimental value to him. Realising that she can\u2019t afford a new car, she started bugging me to sell her my car for slightly more than it\u2019s market value.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want to sell my car. Yes it\u2019s impractical to drive in NYC. Yes it consumes a lot of gas. But it\u2019s my first car, a present from my father. I told her I can pay the initial fee for her new car. She said she wants a Suburban like mine, but a newer one. I told her no because it\u2019s a very pricey car and she won\u2019t handle the maintenance. Please note that our dad is retired and therefore can\u2019t contribute. They live off his retirement savings and Bailey\u2019s income. \n\nOur mum also refused to contribute. She said she would give Bailey her old car, an old Camry, but only if Bailey flies to MN and picks it up or pays for the haulage. Bailey obviously refused this offer. However, they both are judgemental towards me because I refused to sell my car to my sister, drive from NYC to NV and then fly back and buy another car.", "created_utc": 1700904619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183g4cv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_sister_my_car/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
