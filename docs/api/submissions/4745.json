This past weekend I was on a girl's trip with some friends at a casino.  At some point during the trip I picked up a nasty stomach bug.  I spent pretty much all of Sunday-Tuesday within 10-feet of a bathroom at all times.  It was miserable and my body is still recovering.  \n\nMy husband obviously had to pick up a lot of slack during this time, but he's been amazing.  Sure, there are a few chores that are not done but that stuff can always wait.  What can't wait is a huge project at work that I have a deadline on.  The deadline is next Tuesday.\n\nSince I haven't been able to work these past 3 days, I'm already in panic mode about getting this done on time.  I talked with my boss yesterday to give him an update and he suggested that I come into the office over the weekend to make sure the deadline is met. The majority of the things left to do are not things I would be able to work on from home. We both agree that there is too much still undone without working on it this weekend.  I told him that would not be a problem and assured him I would get the project done on time.  \n\nWhen my husband got home with the kids, I told him that I am going to have to work this weekend.  He immediately just plopped his stuff on the counter and went to our bedroom and closed the door.  I made sure the kids were occupied and went to check on him, but he told me he just wanted to be left alone.\n\nWhen he finally came out, I tried to ask him what was wrong but he told me he didn't want to talk about it with the kids around because he has some strong feelings about this and doesn't want it to be a fight, so I had to wait.\n\nWhen the kids were asleep, I finally got him to talk about it.  He said that I should have at the very least consulted him about working this weekend before agreeing to it.  I explained to him how behind I am on this project and how working the weekend is the only way to meet my deadline.  I told him I don't think it's fair to expect me to consult him about things related to my job, especially when deadlines are in play.  If things need to get done by a certain day, I need to do what I need to do to make that happen.\n\nHe told me that I'm prioritizing my needs over his because he hasn't had a break recently like I did with the girl's trip.  He said it's not his fault that I partied so hard that I got myself so sick, which completely pissed me off.  It was a stomach flu, not a hangover.  Hangovers don't last for 3 days and completely incapacitate you.  \n\nI told him he's just going to have to suck it up because I can't miss this deadline or my job might be in jeopardy.  I told him I will find a way to make it up to him somehow, but that's going to have to wait until I make sure this project is done.\n\nHe thinks I'm putting my job above his needs and is convinced my sickness is because I partied too hard.", "created_utc": 1671056659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm45fi/aita_for_not_consulting_my_husband_before_i/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry so much has fallen on you this week, and I\u2019ll make it up to you when this is over. How can we work out a schedule this weekend that\u2019s easiest for you?\u201d", "I was leaning toward no AH until you told him to suck it up. He is burnt out, you have a deadline, communication could've been better but that's life. However, you completely invalidated his feelings over your deadline, and that's why YTA. You could've worked out a babysitter or someone else to come in and help around the house, figured out easier meals together, whatever the case. Instead, you chose to shut his feelings down completely.", "YTA,\nYour husband isn\u2019t mad because you are working this weekend, he\u2019s mad because you just assumed he would pick up the slack, like he did last weekend and most of this week while you were recovering. He\u2019s right of course. You don\u2019t seem to feel bad at all about dumping everything on him. That\u2019s the issue", "YTA, you should have at least told him before you agreed to it. Sounds like he needs a break for himself and is burnt out after this past week, I say that you should let him go on a trip or take some time for himself in the near future.", "YTA for not at least discussing it with your husband before telling your boss you would work all weekend, which results in your husband not have had a break from the kids for 2 weeks straight. Also while it wasn't your fault for getting sick at the girls trip, you still chose to go on the weekend trip so close to a big project deadline - you should've known it was a possibility that you would have to work the weekend before the deadline as well.", "YTA- you got sick because you were partying at a casino. FACT. something you ate or drank (probably off a buffet)  did you in. It's still a lingering result of your weekend trip. \n\nYou showed ZERO consideration for your husband when you failed to at least consult with him before you made a commitment. \n\nAnd then you had the nerve to get pissed off at him? \n\nYou need to own your shit. If your work situation was that precarious you maybe shouldn't have gone on the trip right then. You were always on the edge of this happening with that deadline looming.", "INFO: when is the last time your husband got a boys trip or a weekend away?", "INFO:\n\nWhat would have happened if he said to you \"I've already told my boss I will work this weekend?\"\n\nThis goes both ways, if you don't consult him and he doesn't consult you and you both have to work the weekend, what happens?", "YTA. \"Suck it up\" is not really going to help your husband to see your point of view. You didn't even bother to speak to him about your work situation. It seems you have little respect for him and that he comes after your job and spending time with your friends.", "YTA- slightly \n\nHe hasn\u2019t had a real day off because you went away on the weekend.  Now you\u2019ll be away from home another weekend.  He\u2019s probably burnt out himself and needs a day to himself \n\nHow about hiring a babysitter for the weekend? Sleepover at the grandparents?", "INFO: does your husband work too and if so what kind of schedule does he have?", "Hypothetical question. What would happen to your deadline if you\u2019d gotten sick the day or two before the deadline instead the week prior? Still have to meet deadline while puking your guts out? \n\nYou should be allowed to be sick and not have to sacrifice your personal/family time (the weekend). That screams of poor planning on your company\u2019s part. If your job is in jeopardy for getting sick then that is a bad company. Conversely, If you are truly that indispensable then your job wouldn\u2019t be in jeopardy.\n\nYour husband is probably feeling unimportant.

Sorry, I get where you\u2019re coming from, but considering how much he\u2019s been doing to make up for you being unable (at no fault of your own) to function as usual, I get why he wanted you to talk to him about it first. It is true that you have to do what you have to do in order to get your job done, and you shouldn\u2019t always have to consult with your husband about work, but since what you\u2019re having to do this time is out of the norm, breaking your usual schedule, and directly after a time where he\u2019s already been picking up a lot of slack, I think it\u2019s fair for him to expect a bit of communication about it. Plus, while your decision is just about work stuff, it does effect him too, so he should have a say. It is annoying that he tried to dismiss your illness as a hangover though", "YTA\n\nMarriage is supposed to be a partnership and by you making decisions that affect him without consulting him first\u2026.Of course he has a right to be upset!", "Yta. \n\nYes, you have a deep work commitment. But you have a family commitment too, and you didn\u2019t even think twice about blowing them off and not even communicating it. What if your husband had plans this weekend he hadn\u2019t communicated to you? \n\nYou\u2019re replaceable at your job.

I've had a few hangovers that have lasted multiple days and left me almost entirely unable to function.\n\nUsually when I've spent multiple days in a row partying and drinking.

I have three kids and a full time high pressure job. My husband golfs 1-2 times a week, has a poker night about every other month and belongs to 3 fantasy leagues. Other that a taxi for kids, My only other outing is church on Sunday with the family. This husbands attitude is exactly what I get every year all because he has to be me for a few days. And I have plainly said that to him. My attitude is he has to get over himself or file for divorce and that shit ain\u2019t happening because he would have to do it ALL during his custodial times. So every year I tell him suck it up and put on your big boy pants because I can\u2019t have this weekend, you can\u2019t have golf poker or fantasy football. Moms are always expected to be the martyr and it sucks.", "YTA: a heads up would of been nice instead of treating him like a toddler. He was upset and didn't want a fight yet you kept digging and didn't like the response and your angry?", "YTA. He has been covering for you and picking up slack a lot at home. And btw people don\u2019t react like this if it\u2019s the first time. I\u2019d be betting that you have a history of prioritising work over family.", "YTA. Apart from the hangover conjecture, he handled it well. You're married and share responsibilities. As he said, the very least you could have done is tell your boss you'll consult your family first.", "So first, I just wanna mention that's it's a very good thing that you two were able to wait to have this discussion until after the kids went to sleep. More people should do this.  \n\n\nThat being said, NTA. It was pretty low to accuse you of having a three day hangover, (although I assure you, from experience, they exist.) Work sometimes puts demands on us that we don't like, but we suck it up. And so do our spouses. That's just the way it has to be, sometimes. As spouses, we're supposed to understand that.", "NAH. Even if you had asked him, his answer would be meaningless as you really have no choice but to work over the weekend. That said, his frustration is understandable--it's been one issue after another where he has to bear the whole burden of the household. When you get past this deadline, the two of you should sit down and figure out how he's going to get the break he deserves.", "ESH\n\nYou should have talked to him first.  Then together work out a plan for how to handle the situation. Remember that he is your partner.  Relationships are not 50/50, they are 100/100 each partner gives 100% effort as much as possible so that both people can get the support they need. Expressed to your boss, that due to your sickness their was also extra stress on your family at the moment and you had to consult with your husband. \n\nYour husband should remember that you do have deadlines and you do have to meet them. Sometimes that does mean you have to put work above family.  Again having a conversation with him would have helped this situation.  In addition to that, you got sick, if it was from drinking or a true stomach bug you were sick, it happens.  Its no reason to be angry with anyone. \n\nApologize and communicate with your husband, find why he truly feels you are putting your job above his needs.  It might be more than just tonight.", "INFO: did he tell you he had made plans that now must be canceled because of your work schedule? Also, is he the kind of husband who calls taking care of his own kids \"babysitting\"?", "NTA he needs to grow up. After you meet the deadline he can perfectly take some time off if he wants. As a mom I work more than my husband and I spend more time with my son, but I do not complain about not having \u201cfree time\u201d because when I do need some all I need to do is ask and we make it happen, the same goes for him, we don\u2019t need to throw a tamper tantrum about it, we are adults.", "NAH. Yeah. You should have discussed it but you had to do it.", "ESH, but you more so. You didn't even ask him even though he's been covering for you the past few days. Learn to co-parent please.", "NTA. This isn't the same as extra shifts coming available at work and you taking them before checking in at home. This is the kind of thing that comes up at work sometimes and isn't really optional. Is it ideal? Of course not. But putting your job in jeopardy over this really wouldn't make sense.", "NTA What would his reaction be if you did & said what he did?", "ESH but more so you.

Him for not being more understanding about you deadlines and being sick, and you for not being more compassionate about the fact that he's also balancing a job and has had that and been shouldering the full household duties alone for almost a week. I can understand his resentment for feeling like you got to go out and party and then he gets the home responsibilities dumped on him for the second weekend in a row, with you being sick sandwiched between, but he needs to understand that sometimes shit just happens. On the other hand you also need to understand where he's coming from and how he might feel like the situation isn't fair. You should apologize to him and try to do something nice for him within the next couple weeks, or try to plan some get away time for him as well.\n\nSide note, I suspect his resentment started before this, probably when you first decided to go to vegas. I would question him about that bc, honestly, he probably already felt like you were abandoning to go have fun and this is just adding to that anger he already had. Which, if that is the case, does make him a bit more of an AH bc he should have discussed it thoroughly with you rather than letting it build.", "And he should be sure to add \"suck it up\" in there like she did, I'm sure she'd appreciate his tone. /s", "Work responsibilities trump boy's night.", "Not op\n\nIt reads as though rule for thee and not for me.", "I don\u2019t disagree in principle, my point was the communication part.
