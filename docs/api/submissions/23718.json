They don't and cannot see or really accept there's consequences to actions like this, until it's right there and they HAVE to deal with it. \n\nHer depression is likely spiralling. Not just her OCD. The two generally come as a package. \n\nNow the thing is she does know about what she owes. She's got an idea how much, likely cos there's a part of her brain melting down over it, but she's stuffing that into the deal with it when I absolutely have to shelf. You can't make her take it down, but you might make her put it up higher if you harp on. She's put it in the too hard, I can ignore this zone. \n\nI'd focus more on trying to get her back to therapy. Absolutely nothing will get sorted out at all, if she's not in therapy and not willing to get shit sorted. And if she's not willing to go back to therapy etc.... You cant make her. You have to wait until she says help. \n\nYou can tho, refuse to join in on the order. Honestly I would. No, I'll go get it or I'll have nothing thanks. That's really all you can do. Support her but do not engage in her behaviour.", "NTA you are trying to be a good friend.  What I find hard is the kitchen thing and worrying about dirt in there.

She\u2019s pretty dumb if she thinks she can use the government as an excuse against the banks.  Or she\u2019s expecting family to bail her out.  Or maybe you?

Either way NTA.", "NTA she could hire a housekeeper cheaper than that. She wants to be useless to society if she doesn\u2019t seek help for her mental illness. Give me a break she knows she needs help but is too lazy to actually put in the time. You are right that she is going to ruin her life with that debt.

But it is something that can be overcome with coping strategies. \n\nCredit card debt is absolutely wiping out her credit score, which is going to cause her issues with continuing to get credit cards (and the one's she does get will be on worse terms), but also loans, mortgages and bad credit can lead to issues when finding new rentals as well. Plus of course, eventually those companies may come after her for her debt. There's surely also a secondary concern here too, that take away food is generally not that good for you and so it could be causing her other health concerns down the line. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e works in mental health and she says often the problem is people wanting help. If someone doesn't want help, then as bad as their situation might be, they won't take any help to change it. \n\nI would talk to her boyfriend maybe, or perhaps her family if you know them and raise your concerns.", "NTA- I wavered between \u201cthis woman is an idiot\u201d to \u201coh spoiled princess\u201d stopping at \u201coh dear, legit mental health issues\u201d before settling on \u201cthis woman is an idiot\u201d\n\nShe has no idea and does not care how the real world works, uses her mental health as an excuse to do what ever she wants, blowing off therapy with a specialist. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to get better.

It's touching surfaces in the kitchen that spur obsessive thoughts about germs etc. and then she gets compulsions in response to them that can dismantle her entire day or week or month.

That part is shitty. And I absolutely agree with you that it\u2019s her responsibility to get help. I was diagnosed with BPD due to childhood trauma and spent years in therapy working on myself so I could have a better life.
