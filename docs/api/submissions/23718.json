The two generally come as a package. \n\nNow the thing is she does know about what she owes. She's got an idea how much, likely cos there's a part of her brain melting down over it, but she's stuffing that into the deal with it when I absolutely have to shelf. You can't make her take it down, but you might make her put it up higher if you harp on. She's put it in the too hard, I can ignore this zone. \n\nI'd focus more on trying to get her back to therapy. Absolutely nothing will get sorted out at all, if she's not in therapy and not willing to get shit sorted. And if she's not willing to go back to therapy etc.... You cant make her. You have to wait until she says help. \n\nYou can tho, refuse to join in on the order. Honestly I would. No, I'll go get it or I'll have nothing thanks. That's really all you can do.

Either way NTA.", "NTA she could hire a housekeeper cheaper than that. She wants to be useless to society if she doesn\u2019t seek help for her mental illness.

But it is something that can be overcome with coping strategies. \n\nCredit card debt is absolutely wiping out her credit score, which is going to cause her issues with continuing to get credit cards (and the one's she does get will be on worse terms), but also loans, mortgages and bad credit can lead to issues when finding new rentals as well. Plus of course, eventually those companies may come after her for her debt. There's surely also a secondary concern here too, that take away food is generally not that good for you and so it could be causing her other health concerns down the line. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e works in mental health and she says often the problem is people wanting help.

She isn't pursuing therapy to work on it. I think she figures maybe her parents will eventually step in and pay off the credit card debt since they're financing everything else. \nNTA, OP.", "I agree OP is NTA. Just trying to have some compassion for her because getting help can be scary and hard. She has to be ready to accept it, and maybe she\u2019s not there yet.", "I'm currently in a somewhat similar situation, trying to help a friend whose mental illness is to the point where when something small goes wrong they almost entirely shut down. In my experience, some of it is an unconscious coping mechanism\u2014they don't want to deal with the bigger thing, they're already stressed about that, and even though it seems small from the outside, the minor stressor then subconsciously gives them a 'reason' to dip out.\n\nCan you get in contact with her parents? This is too much for you to deal with alone.", "Struggling implies that she\u2019s trying and failing - she\u2019s not trying at all and she\u2019s all out of ideas, as they say. She obviously still has a healthy appetite though and feels entitled enough to consider not paying the money back so in my view she\u2019s more a freerider than anything else.", "That's not how mental illness works, though. I know that it's so frustrating from the outside, and it's easy to attribute it to greed or selfishness or laziness, but it's more insidious and deeply-rooted than that. I'm currently trying to help a friend in a situation where the solutions are fairly straightforward, but their anxiety has kept them from reaching out for them, and I definitely, *definitely* understand the frustration from the external perspective, but it's so important to remember that it's not about not caring enough, it's about having these internal hurdles that keep them from accepting the help.", "I think people assume those who drop out of therapy aren\u2019t struggling, but like I said, some people aren\u2019t ready to accept help. It doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t suffering.", "I guess I\u2019m much more cynical about people than you. Is it possible? Sure. Is it probable? No, not in my view. Either way, her mistake to make. Her friends and family might put up with it because they love her, but she has a reality check coming if she thinks larger society operates like this.", "Yep, no one is required to fix this for her. But I do have compassion. None of us is perfect.", "NTA- psychiatrist here, have seen similar levels of harm come about due to severe OCD. hopefully she can get on good medications. \nbut like all mental health things: can only help people who need help and mental illness isn\u2019t your fault but is your responsibility", "OP - I am so sorry, this is a horrible position to be in. I have diagnosed OCD and it has gotten to the level your friend is experiencing. If you want one last attempt at a tangible solution in the short term for her, suggest buying frozen meals that be stuck straight in the microwave and plastic utensils (and no, it\u2019s not great for the environment but a person doing what they need to survive is more important than a plastic fork). This is how I fed myself when my panic attacks got so severe I could barely walk. \n\nBeyond that, and I\u2019m so sorry to say this, there isn\u2019t much else you can do. You have to decide what boundaries are necessary in this friendship for your mental health, because you can bleed yourself dry to help her and it won\u2019t change a thing until she decides to get the help. I also say that from personal experience. \n\nYou sound like a really good friend who cares about her a lot. But don\u2019t ever forget that your most important duty is to take care of yourself.", "NTA. However, your friend does sound like she need professional help for her problems. If you can, reach out to her parents and let them know how worried you are. While the money is a concern, her not getting proper help is even more concerning. They might be able to get her that help; this problem is really not something you will be able to cure.", "Her daddy will bail her out. Sounds like an idiot. NTA", "NTA. The credit card companies and creditors definitely don't care about her mental state, they will want their money back regardless. I get that you want to help your friend, but you can't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. You've stated your concerns, she has to want help to change.", "it's none of your business. YTA. youre not wrong, but it's not your place to lecture her OR suggest solutions.", "NTA...Your \"friend\" is an idiot who has been failed by her own parents. Her \"disability\" is otherwise known as \"First World Problemism\". She is lazy and entitled and using shady BS to take the easy way out of everything...She knew if she had seen that doctor, he would have seen right through her BS! Don't pity her...She is making the bed she will have to sleep in, sooner or later.", "NTA but you're probably wrong about her life being ruined by credit card debt. I don't know anyone whose rent is paid but their parents, who also receive an allowance, and also have a car from their parents, who wouldn't also have their credit card debt paid off by parents. \n\nThe rich take care of their kids, even if they shouldn't. It's as simple as that 99% of the time.", "Pl l9 noon", "NTA - she doesn't have a disability - she grew up entitled and has no idea of the real value of money - wonder if her parents pay her credit cards.", "You are NTA but I think your friend needs more help than you can give.", "PSA: b12 deficiency can cause OCD symptoms. Many people do not get enough b12 in their diet. Some people are not able to absorb b12 by ingesting it and require either sublingual tablet supplements or injections. When one is deficient for a while, it takes time to build back up to normal so assessing for improvement after a few weeks is advisable.\n\nNTA but if you can get your friend to get her b12 checked (or just get a bottle of over the counter sublingual tablets for her) the situation could possibly begin to resolve itself.", "NTA. That is a really... unwise reason to get into serious debt over. She sounds like she is having several serious mental health issues. You suggested things to help and she turned you down. Unfortunately, people having issues (drug use, alcohol use, serious depression, bipolar episodes, spending problems, etc) can't be helped unless they WANT to get help. If she was a spouse or family member you would have more reach in trying to push for mental health work but the best thing for you to do might just be to point out you are always there is she needs it and drop it. She may not be willing to admit this is an issue until she run into whatever wall she runs into first pertaining to her problems. I do think continuing to offer to take her places is a good idea. I have several mental health issues myself and while I work at them my Mom is amazing and drags me out to places when I'm becoming too much of a hermit (and I appreciate her doing it not only because it helps & I enjoy being with her but I also have some anxiety over driving. Doesn't keep me from going to work but makes doing 'fun' things harder.)", "NTA\n\nExpressing concern for someone is not a form of discrimination.\n\nPeople throw that word around as if it has no fixed meaning at all.", "> Her dad is a lawyer, she grew up in a beach house, her first car was an Audi, and her parents pay her rent and also give her an allowance.\n\nI really doubt there's a mental health issue there, more likely she never understood how money works and doesn't really value it, she's financially irresponsible because she doesn't struggle for money and takes it for granted.", "I would love more insight from you as a psychiatrist. What are you seeing in this behavioral pattern from her?", "Look. I have pretty much the same issues. Leaving my house makes me anxious, and the kitchen upsets my OCD in a similar way. There are other ways to have quick and easy meals that don't require you to cook. There are weekly meal delivery boxes that you just have to microwave that I've used. I've lived on sandwiches and soups. There's cereal that you can have with milk or eat dry. There are frozen meals. \n\nThere are ways to eat with these mental health issues and not be financially self-destructive, which will only make the mental health issues worse.", "She sounds like she\u2019s using her mental health issues as a crutch to not have to grow up or take responsibility for her actions. Especially when you factor in everything (Atleast from OPs description) being handed to her. I have friends who have done the same thing as far as therapy and it really seems like they were trying to tread water so that they can make excuses for their behavior.", "It's hard to tell through a singular post honestly. But the main thing is OP can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves\n\nI REALLY hope its not the using issues as a crutch though. I've been in a coma, learned to walk and talk again, have severe epilepsy, PCOS, autism and chronic depression (all medicated) and I fight every damn day just to hold a normal job to have some money to survive. I was housebound for 6 years and finally managed to have some sense of normality and my first job at 31 So I'm never hugely empathetic towards people who use illnesses as excuses. I know my history makes me biased though. I hope OPS friend can wake up and get better", "I totally agree. But we know that mentally ill people often are self-destructive, and she hasn\u2019t healed from that yet.", "I\u2019ve had many different types of doctors, and the mental health providers always have *way* more rules and hoops to jump through. \n\nI understand why, but it does make it harder when you\u2019re trying to access care.", "Yep, and sometimes you just don\u2019t fit well or respond well to a particular style or practitioner and need to try something else. It can be a bumpy process that is often scary. Even when I committed to the right therapist and began to get better, being better itseld was scary because it was so new and so tenuous.", "NTA\n\nI also cannot cook food and also have mental disorders. I actually don\u2019t like the texture of food either. I burn stuff and I\u2019ve given myself food poisoning which also didn\u2019t help. I used to eat out much more than I should because of it, however I was gaining weight and it was so expensive. Now I mostly exist on protein shakes. Your friend\u2019s issue isn\u2019t her OCD but honestly, it\u2019s her life and her debt. I wouldn\u2019t bring it up again if I were you.", "Whoa. NTA, you're genuinely trying to help her. I know her response is AHish, but she's basically an addict. Addicts don't like talking about going to rehab. I wouldn't leave her alone and tell her that, as her friend, I'm not going anywhere because I care for her well being and she can call me an AH all she wants.", "NTA", "It's not just a mental health issue, she's obviously ALSO financially illiterate from being coddled.", "You can have mental health issues even if your upbringing looks good on paper.", "Yes, that could be the case. But we don\u2019t know that just from one Reddit post by someone else.", "Is laziness a disability now?", "NTA.  She has so many issues.  Her parents are supporting her (by paying the rent and giving her an allowance).  And it sounds like she has a car.  There are so many other options for eating rather than Ubereats like Factor.  She might have options that are within her budget.   I am horrified that she does not think she has to pay back the debt.   The entitlement is incredible!", "Have you tried making her watch a few episodes of kitchen nightmares? Cause I hate to break it to anyone but even places with good ratings can have some horror stories", "Has she been diagnosed with OCD?", "Seriously, I think the culture of mental illness, where everyone has a diagnosis and expects the world to change to accommodate them, has gone WAAAAY overboard.   Yes, some people have genuine mental illnesses.   But a lot of others need to just grow up and function like adults.   This woman is torpedoing herself by painting herself as an invalid, and it's really sad.", "I'm guessing daddy also is going to pay off her cc's at some point and she knows it.  It's really not your place if she wants to get buried in debt.  You meant well but YTAH.", "YTA leave her alone. What do you care . You\u2019re not paying her bills.", "Makes buying a boat look like a good financial decision...\n\nJesus that's a cursed sentence.", "Pulling away from her friends, too anxious to drive or leave the house, and unwilling to worry about debt because she doesn\u2019t believe in a sound or safe future. Homegirl needs hella therapy ASAP.", "She's probably assuming that at some point daddy will pay off the credit card debt, hence her apparent lack of concern. NTA OP, someone had to say it.", "I'm sure he's the one that will have to pay up in the end. She's wasting his money without a thought.", "How's your relationship with her parents? If you know them to be vaguely reasonable people, you might want to talk to them. This may end your friendship with your friend but it doesn't mean it's the wrong thing to do if they can get her the help she needs.", "Turns out even the wealthy have brains!

He can let her drown until she learns to swim.", "OCD is, pretty famously, not rational.", "It\u2019s not even that long ago that you literally couldn\u2019t just Uber eats food to your self because it didn\u2019t exist\n\nAbout half my family still live in places it doesn\u2019t exist\n\nI hope the friend gets some help", "This post makes me feel less guilty about ordering delivery 1-2 times a month lol", "Maybe you should tell her parents? They\u2019re probably the ones that will have to pay the debt.\n\nMaybe they\u2019ll force her to get a job, maybe living more of a normal life will be good for her.\n\nNTA but you aren\u2019t getting through to someone this batshit crazy / stupid.", "NTA. I'd also let her parents know. If she really has a problem, she needs help. If she's an entitled jerk (which I think is the case) she needs a wake up call. Please don't let her make it your problem", "No, it\u2019s ok. Because of the way the government is these days, she\u2019s just going to declare bankruptcy and it will just poof!", "one can never say without meeting and doing a psychiatric interview with the patient, but it\u2019s not unheard of for people\u2019s contamination obsessions to be so severe that they can\u2019t be in the kitchen (or any area for that matter- maybe a different person feels like bedrooms are contaminated, etc).\n\nundergoing massive work arounds to avoid OCD symptoms (such as literally ordering all food) is also pretty typical of severe OCD. isolation can be a symptom too more related to how OCD symptoms preoccupy time or if the person literally feels they can\u2019t leave the house (for example car is contaminated).\n\nonly a psychiatrist who actually works with her would know for certain the things I mentioned. I\u2019ve never met her. But if it is as severe as it sounds like she needs good medications. \n\nShe also probably feels really alone in her suffering and like no one would ever understand. So if you wanted to tell her you\u2019re there for her to tell you about it, no matter how ridiculous it may sound, that could be good. Empathy always good. Patients just have a hard time sometimes sharing about their experiences cause they feel so bizarre and are stressful to talk about.\n\nHopefully she gets professional care, beyond just therapy. Meds and therapy better than just meds or just therapy alone.", "Dude that\u2019s why it\u2019s a mental illness. They tend not to be rational", "NTA but this is not your problem, none of your business and no one asked for your help or suggestions so I see why she got upset.

While you speaking up wont do much, its important to speak up. \n\nI became severely agoraphobic but i was forced to start going outside and eating food i made at least once a day when my therapist told me to and my credit card was cancelled. It was very frightening. Before that I got frequent panic attacks in public or if i thought of leaving. Grocery shopping was AWFUL. \nLoud, dirty, i didnt know what to get or how to meal plan; sometimes men would approach me. I eventually would get super high and listen to music to shop. God bless weed; it would get me out the door. I dont need it nowadays to get out but for a few years there it was my lifeline. \n\nI didnt really have people speaking up against me in my life but I remember the two times it happened; the first time i was upset and not receptive. The second it was like being brought to confront the reality i ignored daily. It was important. \n\nYou cant help people if they arent ready and tired of failing. But if they are when you point it out, theyll need a lil help.", "INFO: Are her parents aware that she is slipping into a mental illness fueled financial crisis? Are they even aware of how many credit cards she has?", "This post just made me feel so much better about my situation lol", "NTA - \n\nIt sounds like she is perhaps on the path to full-blown agoraphobia.  I do not know how close you are or if you know her family, but that anxiety could become truly debilitating without some intervention."]}
