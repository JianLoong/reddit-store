And there was some major \u2018drama\u2019 during the birth. \n\nFor some context, I have chronic heart problems and have been struggling with it since birth. I had a surgery when I was an infant, another at 7 and another at 15. I haven\u2019t needed one since and have been doing well all around. When my girlfriend was 6 months pregnant, I got really, really ill and it took a massive toll on my lungs and heart. I pulled through but spent about a month in the hospital. I felt so awful that I couldn\u2019t be with my girlfriend (Jane) but she was super great with it. \n\nThen, 2 days before the due date, I was rushed into the hospital due to a build-up of fluid around my heart. I had to get the fluid removed asap. When the fluid was all out, my BIL came to visit me and he told me Jane had given birth. I was both ecstatic and devastated. \n\nI had to spend the night under supervision but as soon as I was allowed to leave, I went to the maternity wing to see my wife and baby. At the time, all negative emotions were smothered by our bundle of joy but over the months, Jane has been showing more and more signs of resentment towards me. \n\nIt came to a head last night during our date night. I had the whole day planned; baby had gone to grandmas, her favourite take out, got all her favourite movies ready to play, spa evening planned, etc. But she wasn\u2019t feeling any of it. I asked her what was wrong and she said she\u2019s angry at me for missing the birth. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t handle it as best as I wanted to, but we argued for a bit and I ended up calling her selfish for saying that. I asked her if she understood the severity of the situation and that I was very ill. She got up and said she wasn't going to let me patronise her and that she's never been disrespected like that before and that she's going to bed. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683239838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1382fcx/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for_being/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is she going to *punish* you forever for that as if you had control over it in the first place? NTA.\n\nMy boyfriend passed away due to acute coronary syndrome. You never, EVER, think twice over the medical attention your heart needs even at times like this.", "Is she serious? What the fuck were you supposed to do?? \n\nNTA", "NTA. its fine to be hurt but to hold that resentment against you is just really spiteful. It is not your fault you missed the birth. Unfortunate situation, but your health matters too.", "Whuuuttt?? YOU WERE HOSPITALIZED WITH CARDIAC EDEMA!! \ud83d\ude02 \nYeah, NTA at all. You were broken-hearted that you missed the birth, but if they had you in there to save your life then what the hell did she expect??\nI Can understand her being upset because you missed the birth, but she shouldn\u2019t be upset at YOU. I\u2019d be upset that things went the way they went but would definitely not blame you for it!!", "NTA.\n\nJane is acting like you wanted to miss the birth of your child. I\u2019m assuming if you didn\u2019t get the fluid out asap, you could\u2019ve died. Sure, you won\u2019t get that moment but it couldn\u2019t be helped\n\nBeing upset? Sure. Holding resentment for something out of your control and could\u2019ve took your life? That is wrong of your girlfriend OP", "NTA but I'm gonna go with that's not what she's upset about.\n\nI believe something else is stuck in her crawl and she's using this issue as a stand in for talking about the real issue. Like are you live long enough to see this child raised? How many important events will be missed because of your health? Will she end up being a caregiver for you while attempting to raise the child all on her own? Will she one day be standing at your graveside with toddler on her hip, crying her eyes out over you? Should she think about leaving you to find someone more likely to be there for her and the baby long term? Would it hurt more to rip the bandage off quickly or watch you slowly deteriorate and pass?\n\nBefore people lose their freaking minds on me, let me just say that all those questions are super shitty to ask the OP because he has no control over his body or the direction his medical issues take in the future. The GF knows this and that's why she isn't bringing up any of the hard questions. Instead, she's just letting the fact that OP missed the birth eat away at her day after day.\n\nThe only path I see moving forward is to broach those hard subjects and talk them out. Be empathic and expect empathy in return. Help her see that the future is not guaranteed, no matter who you're with.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t purposely miss the birth, You were physically hospitalized. She seems immature if she can\u2019t fathom the severity of your situation. I\u2019m guessing the alternative would be you dead, missing the birth regardless.", "NTA - You were physically incapable of being there for the birth of your child, what did she think was going to happen?\n\nHow was she being patronized? Being told that you couldn\u2019t be there for the birth of your child was impossible and there nothing you could\u2019ve done that would\u2019ve changed that.", "NTA - She held that resentment in for over a YEAR. Over something you literally had no control over! It\u2019d be reasonable *shortly after the fact* for her to confide \u201cI feel so disappointed that you had to miss the birth of our son,\u201d you\u2019d say \u201cme too,\u201d and you could both talk about your hurt feelings together and how this was so unfair *for the both of you.* Instead she let this fester for a year, and during all of that rumination, she holds resentment for you over it. When, again, this was out of your hands. You had a medical emergency.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but she\u2019s the one who disrespected you. I\u2019d also legitimately question if she understood the severity of your medical situation if she was still angry at you and arguing with you about it a year later.", "NTA, she needs to be grateful you survived. This resentment has already tarnished enough of your baby's life this far. She needs to nip this in the bud before your child resents her for it. She is creating her own misery by holding onto this, I hope you guys can over come and move forward.", "NTA, but your baby mama sure is. She is fortunate, given your medical history, to have her kids dad still alive and able to be a dad!", "NTA\n\nShe could have maybe had you there with the birth and in exchange, live the rest of her life a single parent.", "NTA - It's not like you were off playing poker with your buddies.", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend feeling resentful that you missed it is reasonable. But blaming you and actually expressing anger *towards you* is not. This is a complicated situation. She was alone during one of the scariest and most painful times in her life, it\u2019s reasonable that feels resentful and upset towards the situation. But she should approach it with the understanding you didn\u2019t have a choice. There\u2019s a difference between \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time still with the fact that you weren\u2019t there\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m upset *with you* for not being there.\u201d \n\nSorry OP, hopefully she can learn to channel her disappointment and resentment in a healthier way. Perhaps have a conversation with her about it and give her the space to be upset without judgement. If she\u2019s insisting on blaming you and getting angry with you though that\u2019s messed up and you deserve better.", "NTA. I would accuse her of disrespecting you, how dare she give birth while you were trying not to die!  She could have just closed her legs tightly together.  /s", "NTA and WHAATTT??? How does you being in the hospital under care for what could possibly be DEADLY condition translate into you being \"disrespectful\"?  (I don't think that word means what she thinks it means.)  This is some DARVO shit right here...if you'd gone partying with your friends and missed this event from a hangover, or even so you could watch the game. ...THAT is disrespectful. There is some crazy ass mental gymnastics going on here for her to accuse you of disrespecting her. \n\nHas she had a mental health check up since baby was born? I am wondering if she has post partum depression or pospartum psychosis, either of which could explain why she is equating you not being there with being disrespectful. It is not logical at all to make that leap, because you could have gone downhill really fast in that situation. \n\nI wonder if she really gets how severe your heart issie is. I have a friend who had a baby born with his heart externally, he had six surgeries by the time he was 4, and as an adult now, he has to micromanage his health because of it. So I totally get your situation, but maybe she truly doesn't see the need for being extra careful... Maybe you can get in touch with your cardiologist's office and see if they have any information videos or packets they give out to parents of babies with heart issues and she can read up on it or watch the videos to see this situation was NOT AN ACTUAL CHOICE for you.", "NTA. She is not your GF. She maybe a mother of your child but based on the info you provided she does not care about you anymore", "You know damn well know you're in the right. You never even had a choice wtf.", "NTA. It's bad enough that she's mad about something that you couldn't prevent from happening, but it's worse that she ruined date night and started a fight. You planned what should have been a great day for her, and she just completely ruined it.", "Nta\n\nIf she had ANY common sense, she\u2019d understand- she knows she wrong, hence the I\u2019ve never been disrespected so much and flounce off.", "NTA.  Your gf was hurt you could not be there and that is okay despite the situation.  She is the AH to not understand that your are also hurt and devastated that you could not be there.   I hope you guys can work through this", "NTA. What did she actually want you to do?", "NTA She may be disappointed always that you missed the birth. That\u2019s fair. I\u2019m sure you are, too. However, being angry at you rather than disappointed with the situation makes her the AH. \n\nWould she think it reasonable if you were mad at her for going into labor while you were in the hospital for life-saving treatment? Why didn\u2019t she wait another 48 hours? Nonsense, right? \n\nYou didn\u2019t choose to miss the birth, and she has no right to be angry with you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get it what does she think you were supposed to do?", "I'm getting the sense that she wants to break up,  but she wants you to be the bad guy (girl). Kind of like she's manufacturing a situation.  Maybe I'm misreading though.", "INFO did she have a support person for birth? Did you both have alternate plans in place in case you were sick? Also how is she doing now, a year later? It sounds either like this was traumatic for her or that she\u2019s hitting a wall on parenting or your relationship.

Giving birth is incredibly stressful, and frankly traumatic. Even under the best of circumstances. It genuinely sounds as though the trauma of giving birth while you were going through emergency surgery may have dealt a rather significant hit on her mental health. \n\nCan you imagine how terrifying that would be? You're giving birth for the first time, and you go into labour right after your husband, your anchor that you're counting on to be there to support you through this terrifying ordeal, has been admitted for emergency surgery on his heart? She must have felt so scared, and alone. \n\nObviously it is not your fault that you were not able to be there, and I can imagine it also took a toll on you, to miss the birth of your child.  However it genuinely seems as though she is struggling, and that she is latching onto that one traumatic event as the cause. \n\nPlease try to get your wife some help from a professional who specializes in post partum depression, and trauma, because if that is what this is, it most likely won't self resolve.", "Mildly suspicious; this sounds like a story that\u2019s making the rounds about a conservative talk show host right now.", "NTA, but your wife is.

Ask her if she\u2018d rather had you there during birth but be a widow and single mom now.", "INFO: Was the birth traumatic or difficult?\n\nLook, NTA at the end of the day regardless of the answer to that. But it sounds like she has some resentment that you weren't there and needs to talk it out and get to a point where she's cool. If she can't do that with you, maybe she needs a therapist.\n\nBut honestly at the end of the day, what the hell were you supposed to do? Easy verdict here.", "Get off Reddit and get into couples counseling.", "NAH. Have u considered that maybe she's not asking for an apology but trying to share her feelings? She can be angry about something and you could have done nothing wrong at the same time. They're not mutually exclusive. Not being able to air those emotions could lead to resentment, especially if she's tried and gotten defensive responses.", "NTA.  What the fuck did she expect you to do?  If she's resenting you for this she needs a big fat bucket of therapy.", "It sounds like Jane wanted to share this life-changing moment with you very much, which is a good thing. But since you weren't able to come, she has built up some resentment. Those emotions are perfectly normal, but waiting a year to express them hasn't helped. While you intended a nice date night, it may also have been the only time she had to vent up to that point.\n\nHave you considered couples counseling? I think that this is about communication and empathy more than the actual event itself.\n\nNAH", "NTA: She clearly could care less about your well being.", "YTA. Any first birth is traumatic and difficult and if you\u2019ve never done if you cannot conceive of how hormones change your brain. \n\nYou seem to have some experience with being in a terrifying hospital tissue-ripping scenario so show some sympathy and respect her feelings without resorting to name calling when you\u2019re speaking to the mother of your child.", "YTA just get better idiot skill issue", "INFO: is your gf a SAHM?  Could she be resentful of your working and her staying at home?", "Yta for calling her selfish.\nShe gets to feel how she feels. assuming she's intelligent enough to understand you had no choice in the matter, her anger is misdirected at you rather than the situation - which is a very human thing to do, because its very hard to take your anger out on a situation and very easy to take it out on a person.\n\nYou may already know that anger is a secondary emotion; that is its triggered by something else, such as grief, frustration, disappointment, which would all be normal things to feel in response to the situation that happened when she gave birth, as I'm sure you had both envisioned/looked forward to you being there.\n\nI hope you can resolve it with some calm, understanding conversation. \n\nObviously  (I hope!)

But why?\n\nThere's also the fact that she was fine with it at first, but now she's not! So is she in like a mommy group that's real against the other parent not being there during delivery? Is she have a friend who had a perfect birth plan go through and now she's jealous? Like what happened recently to bring this up?

But even if she doesn't have PPD/PPA, she probably needs therapy", "NTA, but your gf may be having serious late post partum depression or post partum anxiety.  She likely never processed many emotions surrounding that time that are now spilling out of her because her hormones are out of whack.  1 year mark is late for both ppd and ppa but mine hit me at 8 months for kiddo 1 and 10 for kiddo 2 so it\u2019s not unheard of.  Also if she\u2019s weaning the kiddo off breastmilk, there\u2019s a grief-like thing that happens when you do that.

It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love you or that they resent you or anything like that. But it is a normal human emotion to get ground down by feeling like the chronically ill partner\u2019s needs will always supersede yours. \n\nPregnancy and childbirth are extremely stressful and can go from all good to holy crap mom needs a crash c section in a moment.

I\u2019m sorry for you, I suppose she is a fantastic human but she is so selfish", "Him dying in the delivery room, smiling sweetly as he held his baby, knowing he would live in through this sweet, perfect child \u2026 you have to admit, it\u2019s *so romantic.*", "I understand that he wants to break up, but he wants you to be the bad guy (girl). It's like he's creating a situation. I'm reading it wrong though.", "Well die ofc", "I think OP is a woman. She says her and her girlfriend are \"both 26f.\" Otherwise, I agree.", "You actually make a really good point, and if that\u2019s true then the GF is not necessarily an AH either; there are legit worries to consider, especially after having a child. Since she is aware that none of this is his fault she may feel she can\u2019t burden him with all these worries so she just picked the cherry on the icing to explain her attitude, but you are 100% correct that this incident may have led her to question so much more about the future of her baby and her relationship with a partner who is ill\u2026\nWow. OP you really need to touch base with her, she probably feels like you are the last person that needs to hear these grievances.", "Also, \n\nA LOT of women have \u201cbirth regret\u201d.  Which is when something goes wrong off the birth plan, and it makes them sad that they didn\u2019t have X.  (Maybe a natural birth if they ended up getting meds, or being sad that they didn\u2019t give vaginal birth because of an emergency and having a c section). \n\nIt\u2019s a *really really* stressful and emotional time, and being alone while her partner was in the hospital with a *serious* life long illness  and missing out on that, probably also is leading to some of the \u201cbirth regret\u201d. \n\nAnd everything else you listed on top of that would just make the emotions so much worse.  \n\nShe probably needs to see a therapist, so she can have someone safe to discuss all this.", "This is a really thoughtful post. There has to be so much more going on for both of them.\nNTA", "Two mothers", "OP is a mom, not a dad.", "Agreed she is not the AH to have the emotion, but she does need to own it and do the work to get over it.", "This! And the fact that she hasn't said anything for a year is because she knows it's not rational but that doesn't mean she's not angry and upset that he wasn't there and that she was alone (without him).\n\nShe just needs a bit of professional help. It might be helpful for him too. To understand where she's coming from, and how difficult a time that was for her. likely for months whilst in late pregnancy through birth and then months after, scared about his health, if he'll die, if she raise a baby alone, if tell him how she feels will upset him so much it messes with his heart.\n\nTrauma isn't rational.", "Exactly!  I think she is leaving a lot out, like how it was handled after the fact. What has she said to her, and what has she let her say. I think this is what is causing the problems, and honestly, without further honest context, I lean towards YTA.", "OP could've had a very life-changing moment if she didn't get it taken care of immediately. \n\nHopefully, they both get to a place where they're both disappointed about *what happened* to prevent OP from being at the birth, instead of being mad at OP for not being there.", "His wife is mad at him for not dying and she's not an asshole oooook", "She literally was in the hospital too, tho.", "dam 2023 and people cant read for shit. thats tuff", "Lol OP wouldn't be alive if they attended the birth but hey this is Reddit so it's better to attend the birth and DIE rather than go to the hospital for a literal life threatening condition... The pits", "ngl lil bro , you sound dumbs asf.", "Doesn't OP get to feel how she feels, too? OP thinks it was a selfish statement. NTA", "They're both women fyi", "Her*", "You are absolutely right. My bad. Thanks for pointing it out.  :-)", "First off. Actually READ THE POST. OP is a female, if you want to just be an idiot go elsewhere. Secondly they've been together long enough for her to know the severity of the condition and should have thought about that before deciding to get knocked up and popping out a kid.", "I mean that would still make the GF an AH. Lashing out at OP because of concerns about OP\u2019s mortality is not productive or healthy. It\u2019s totally valid for the GF to have those concerns, but there is a much better way of going about it than being resentful", "OP is a woman", "*she. They are both 26F", "Ok thanks, missed that.", "Thank you for the correction!"]}
