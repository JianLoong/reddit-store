And there was some major \u2018drama\u2019 during the birth. \n\nFor some context, I have chronic heart problems and have been struggling with it since birth. I had a surgery when I was an infant, another at 7 and another at 15. I haven\u2019t needed one since and have been doing well all around. When my girlfriend was 6 months pregnant, I got really, really ill and it took a massive toll on my lungs and heart. I pulled through but spent about a month in the hospital. I felt so awful that I couldn\u2019t be with my girlfriend (Jane) but she was super great with it. \n\nThen, 2 days before the due date, I was rushed into the hospital due to a build-up of fluid around my heart. I had to get the fluid removed asap. When the fluid was all out, my BIL came to visit me and he told me Jane had given birth. I was both ecstatic and devastated. \n\nI had to spend the night under supervision but as soon as I was allowed to leave, I went to the maternity wing to see my wife and baby. At the time, all negative emotions were smothered by our bundle of joy but over the months, Jane has been showing more and more signs of resentment towards me. \n\nIt came to a head last night during our date night. I had the whole day planned; baby had gone to grandmas, her favourite take out, got all her favourite movies ready to play, spa evening planned, etc. But she wasn\u2019t feeling any of it. I asked her what was wrong and she said she\u2019s angry at me for missing the birth. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t handle it as best as I wanted to, but we argued for a bit and I ended up calling her selfish for saying that. I asked her if she understood the severity of the situation and that I was very ill. She got up and said she wasn't going to let me patronise her and that she's never been disrespected like that before and that she's going to bed. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683239838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1382fcx/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_selfish_for_being/", "score": 1967, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What the fuck were you supposed to do?? \n\nNTA", "NTA. its fine to be hurt but to hold that resentment against you is just really spiteful. It is not your fault you missed the birth. Unfortunate situation, but your health matters too.", "Whuuuttt?? YOU WERE HOSPITALIZED WITH CARDIAC EDEMA!! \ud83d\ude02 \nYeah, NTA at all. You were broken-hearted that you missed the birth, but if they had you in there to save your life then what the hell did she expect??\nI Can understand her being upset because you missed the birth, but she shouldn\u2019t be upset at YOU. I\u2019d be upset that things went the way they went but would definitely not blame you for it!!", "NTA.\n\nJane is acting like you wanted to miss the birth of your child.

Holding resentment for something out of your control and could\u2019ve took your life? That is wrong of your girlfriend OP", "NTA but I'm gonna go with that's not what she's upset about.\n\nI believe something else is stuck in her crawl and she's using this issue as a stand in for talking about the real issue. Like are you live long enough to see this child raised? How many important events will be missed because of your health? Will she end up being a caregiver for you while attempting to raise the child all on her own? Will she one day be standing at your graveside with toddler on her hip, crying her eyes out over you? Should she think about leaving you to find someone more likely to be there for her and the baby long term? Would it hurt more to rip the bandage off quickly or watch you slowly deteriorate and pass?\n\nBefore people lose their freaking minds on me, let me just say that all those questions are super shitty to ask the OP because he has no control over his body or the direction his medical issues take in the future. The GF knows this and that's why she isn't bringing up any of the hard questions. Instead, she's just letting the fact that OP missed the birth eat away at her day after day.\n\nThe only path I see moving forward is to broach those hard subjects and talk them out. Be empathic and expect empathy in return. Help her see that the future is not guaranteed, no matter who you're with.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t purposely miss the birth, You were physically hospitalized. She seems immature if she can\u2019t fathom the severity of your situation. I\u2019m guessing the alternative would be you dead, missing the birth regardless.", "NTA - You were physically incapable of being there for the birth of your child, what did she think was going to happen?\n\nHow was she being patronized? Being told that you couldn\u2019t be there for the birth of your child was impossible and there nothing you could\u2019ve done that would\u2019ve changed that.", "NTA - She held that resentment in for over a YEAR. Over something you literally had no control over!

When, again, this was out of your hands. You had a medical emergency.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but she\u2019s the one who disrespected you. I\u2019d also legitimately question if she understood the severity of your medical situation if she was still angry at you and arguing with you about it a year later.", "NTA, she needs to be grateful you survived. This resentment has already tarnished enough of your baby's life this far. She needs to nip this in the bud before your child resents her for it. She is creating her own misery by holding onto this, I hope you guys can over come and move forward.", "NTA, but your baby mama sure is. She is fortunate, given your medical history, to have her kids dad still alive and able to be a dad!", "NTA\n\nShe could have maybe had you there with the birth and in exchange, live the rest of her life a single parent.", "NTA - It's not like you were off playing poker with your buddies.", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend feeling resentful that you missed it is reasonable. But blaming you and actually expressing anger *towards you* is not. This is a complicated situation. She was alone during one of the scariest and most painful times in her life, it\u2019s reasonable that feels resentful and upset towards the situation. But she should approach it with the understanding you didn\u2019t have a choice. There\u2019s a difference between \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time still with the fact that you weren\u2019t there\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m upset *with you* for not being there.\u201d \n\nSorry OP, hopefully she can learn to channel her disappointment and resentment in a healthier way. Perhaps have a conversation with her about it and give her the space to be upset without judgement. If she\u2019s insisting on blaming you and getting angry with you though that\u2019s messed up and you deserve better.", "NTA. I would accuse her of disrespecting you, how dare she give birth while you were trying not to die!  She could have just closed her legs tightly together.  /s", "NTA and WHAATTT??? How does you being in the hospital under care for what could possibly be DEADLY condition translate into you being \"disrespectful\"?  (I don't think that word means what she thinks it means.)  This is some DARVO shit right here...if you'd gone partying with your friends and missed this event from a hangover, or even so you could watch the game. ...THAT is disrespectful. There is some crazy ass mental gymnastics going on here for her to accuse you of disrespecting her. \n\nHas she had a mental health check up since baby was born? I am wondering if she has post partum depression or pospartum psychosis, either of which could explain why she is equating you not being there with being disrespectful. It is not logical at all to make that leap, because you could have gone downhill really fast in that situation. \n\nI wonder if she really gets how severe your heart issie is. I have a friend who had a baby born with his heart externally, he had six surgeries by the time he was 4, and as an adult now, he has to micromanage his health because of it. So I totally get your situation, but maybe she truly doesn't see the need for being extra careful... Maybe you can get in touch with your cardiologist's office and see if they have any information videos or packets they give out to parents of babies with heart issues and she can read up on it or watch the videos to see this situation was NOT AN ACTUAL CHOICE for you.", "NTA. She is not your GF. She maybe a mother of your child but based on the info you provided she does not care about you anymore", "You know damn well know you're in the right. You never even had a choice wtf.", "NTA. It's bad enough that she's mad about something that you couldn't prevent from happening, but it's worse that she ruined date night and started a fight. You planned what should have been a great day for her, and she just completely ruined it.", "Nta\n\nIf she had ANY common sense, she\u2019d understand- she knows she wrong, hence the I\u2019ve never been disrespected so much and flounce off.", "NTA.  Your gf was hurt you could not be there and that is okay despite the situation.  She is the AH to not understand that your are also hurt and devastated that you could not be there.   I hope you guys can work through this", "NTA. What did she actually want you to do?", "NTA She may be disappointed always that you missed the birth. That\u2019s fair. I\u2019m sure you are, too. However, being angry at you rather than disappointed with the situation makes her the AH. \n\nWould she think it reasonable if you were mad at her for going into labor while you were in the hospital for life-saving treatment? Why didn\u2019t she wait another 48 hours? Nonsense, right? \n\nYou didn\u2019t choose to miss the birth, and she has no right to be angry with you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get it what does she think you were supposed to do?", "I'm getting the sense that she wants to break up,  but she wants you to be the bad guy (girl).

Giving birth is incredibly stressful, and frankly traumatic. Even under the best of circumstances. It genuinely sounds as though the trauma of giving birth while you were going through emergency surgery may have dealt a rather significant hit on her mental health. \n\nCan you imagine how terrifying that would be? You're giving birth for the first time, and you go into labour right after your husband, your anchor that you're counting on to be there to support you through this terrifying ordeal, has been admitted for emergency surgery on his heart? She must have felt so scared, and alone. \n\nObviously it is not your fault that you were not able to be there, and I can imagine it also took a toll on you, to miss the birth of your child.  However it genuinely seems as though she is struggling, and that she is latching onto that one traumatic event as the cause. \n\nPlease try to get your wife some help from a professional who specializes in post partum depression, and trauma, because if that is what this is, it most likely won't self resolve.", "Mildly suspicious; this sounds like a story that\u2019s making the rounds about a conservative talk show host right now.", "NTA, but your wife is.

Easy verdict here.", "Get off Reddit and get into couples counseling.", "NAH. Have u considered that maybe she's not asking for an apology but trying to share her feelings?

If she's resenting you for this she needs a big fat bucket of therapy.", "It sounds like Jane wanted to share this life-changing moment with you very much, which is a good thing.

But why?\n\nThere's also the fact that she was fine with it at first, but now she's not! So is she in like a mommy group that's real against the other parent not being there during delivery? Is she have a friend who had a perfect birth plan go through and now she's jealous? Like what happened recently to bring this up?

But even if she doesn't have PPD/PPA, she probably needs therapy", "NTA, but your gf may be having serious late post partum depression or post partum anxiety.  She likely never processed many emotions surrounding that time that are now spilling out of her because her hormones are out of whack.  1 year mark is late for both ppd and ppa but mine hit me at 8 months for kiddo 1 and 10 for kiddo 2 so it\u2019s not unheard of.  Also if she\u2019s weaning the kiddo off breastmilk, there\u2019s a grief-like thing that happens when you do that.  And any grief has a funny way of dredging up unresolved unrelated shit and saying \u201cthis is the problem\u201d.", "NAH - I\u2019m going against most comments here, but hear me out.\n\nIt can be challenging to be with someone with a chronic medical condition. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love you or that they resent you or anything like that. But it is a normal human emotion to get ground down by feeling like the chronically ill partner\u2019s needs will always supersede yours. \n\nPregnancy and childbirth are extremely stressful and can go from all good to holy crap mom needs a crash c section in a moment.

Depending on how you responded, I'd be angry about the response. And likewise, depending on how *she'd* phrased it, I'd also be angry at her for stating it the way she did. My guess is that neither of you communicated very well and/or that there's some denial or fear going on (will I have to give birth alone again next time? will he survive? how will I mother X children essentially alone for X months or potentially longer?). I'd work to figure out, together, and possibly with the help of a couples therapist, whether either of you are in denial, how you'll both cope with hard situations like these in the future, anything a doctor could've feasibly/proactively done to prevent something like this (there may very well not be anything, but it might be good for you both to ask and/or for her to hear it), and how to mutually express your grief/anger in a way that can both validate the others' feelings without blame or guilt.

For example: If you had missed the birth because you'd rather go to a game instead of being at the birth.   \nBut how can she be resentful when you literally didn't have a choice?  \nAsk her what she would have wanted you to do instead of having life saving heart surgery.  \nAsk her what other choices you could have made in order for you to not miss the birth.  \nI am really curious about her answers.  \n\n\nShe is allowed to feel disappointed in the situation. But instead she chooses to be resentful and blame YOU for having the audacity to need heart surgery at the wrong time.   \nAnd she has felt this for over a year. wow.", "NAH. No, you weren't supposed to ignore your health, but she was left alone in a very terrifying moment. It's no one's fault. But what about the future? How much more will you miss? It's... very scary.

I don\u2019t think she verbalized it well, but I think she was just looking for empathy. Like \u201cI\u2019m sorry the timing sucked\u201d kind of thing, and for you to listen to her trauma without judgment. Not an apology for having a legit medical emergency. Unless she\u2019s completely dense, she\u2019s fully aware that you couldn\u2019t actually have changed the outcome of what happened and that you were where you needed to be, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she still had a traumatic birth experience because of it. That shit changes you, and it does so on top of the changes she was going to deal with anyway as a new mother full of hormones her body (and brain!) isn\u2019t used to dealing with. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe to someone that hasn\u2019t given birth the changes that it makes to the way your brain operates.

A lot of people would guess it\u2019s just worrying constantly about something bad happening to your baby, but it can also look like obsessing over things you shouldn\u2019t and otherwise wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had 2 babies and both times found myself dwelling on things I never would\u2019ve thought twice about before. And it was *so much worse* after my traumatic birth. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a little of what\u2019s going on here. She needs therapy. You need therapy. Separately *and* together if you\u2019re going to learn how to communicate going forward. And she should also let her care provider know what\u2019s going on because there are medications that she may benefit from to help through this temporary period.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all medically ok and I hope you find a healthy way to process this shitty hand you were dealt.", "NAH. Your girlfriend is expressing her huge disappointment in the only way she knows how. It's not your fault, but I can also understand how she would feel devastated that you weren't there.  Childbirth is bloody scary, and it would have been really hard without you. Maybe some couples counselling to reframe this so you can both mourn the loss of the birth experience you had planned and wanted. If it's your first kid, that also makes it harder.  After the first kid, you know what you're in for, so handle it better.

It was a horrible, and wonderful, once in a lifetime moment that didn't go the way you both planned. There's grief there, and yes, anger, but I suspect in time she'll realize she's mad at the circumstance. It was traumatic for both of you. \n\nI also think there's probably worry about your lives together. As she was giving birth she may have been worrying that she'd end up alone which must have been awful. Talk about facing the fragility and unpredictability of life, and at the worst possible time. \n\nIt's not anyone's fault that you each went through that alone...

You may have been in the hospital for one month, but you can bet she worried about you the from you getting sick til she gave birth. 3 months where she should have been happy and taking care of herself and preparing for the baby, and in the back of her mind she is worrying about you, stressing and acting brave. \n\nThen comes the birth and again you get sick.

Can you really blame her for feeling alone and resenting that she had to do it without you, while probably fearing if it will happen again? She\u2019s tried to push the feeling down, but can\u2019t any longer. She isn\u2019t really mad at you, she is mad at the situation and doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it, so you become her target. Add the new baby stress and it\u2019s a powder keg.

That doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re to blame or that she doesn\u2019t understand the gravity of your illness. The correct response wasn\u2019t argument, but empathy.

You shouldn't be penalized for your legitimate health issues. \n\nBut, you guys have to talk about this if you want it to resolve.

It sounds like you weren't even notified, but even if you were what could you do? I think she also doesn't realise that you missed out on the birth. And to hold it against you is really quite a terrible thing for her to do.", "NTA.\n\nPoint blank her, ask her straight out,\n\nWhat would you rather have, a baby and a funeral, OR, a baby and your undisputed partner?", "My (33f) wife (42f) has a pacemaker for a serious heart condition that could possibly be detrimental if the pacemaker stopped working. I don\u2019t have biological children and don\u2019t plan on it but if I was pregnant when we first got together and something happened like OP\u2019s situation, I would not be pissed at my wife for not being able to be there.

Because that doesn\u2019t sound like a fun relationship", "NTA.  Holy shit, you could have died.  Would she rather you be dead than miss the birth?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m floored she\u2019s still mad at you over something you had no control over. Like you were seriously ill and could have died. \n\nIs she always this selfish and over dramatic? What was she planning to do if you did die.\n\nYou went out of your way to plan a nice day for the both of you and this is how she treats you? You really need to have a talk with her because you shouldn\u2019t be paying for this forever.", "NTA. \n\nIs the heart condition hereditary?", "NTA.  It's completely unreasonable for her to brood and nurse her resentment about something you had zero control over for *an entire year*, and then blindside you with it the way she did.  In fact, that is *so* strange that I'm wondering if's really about hurt feelings and disappointment, or if she's manufacturing an excuse to break up with you.", "NTA but I understand where your gf is coming from. She has the right to be upset at the situation but not at you. You cannot help it and it sucks but it\u2019s just the way it played out. You guys should sit down and have an honest conversation about it so you can both move forward.", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t get sick you would have been there. You didn\u2019t miss it on purpose and I\u2019m sure you probably felt guilt and sad you weren\u2019t there.\n\nIf she knew about your medical issues she should have realized this could be a possibility. Did she want you to die or something? You can\u2019t go back and fix it but you can move forward and be the best dad you can be. Life rarely goes to plan and she should be happy you are here, and trying to be a good dad and partner. She sounds really awful.", "NTA by any means. Being with someone with a chronic illness means sometimes they end up missing things. Sometimes they can't help but be sick. And she should be able to recognize the symptoms between you being dramatic and you being actually in need of medical attention. If she can't deal with your medical conditions that is something you might want to find out sooner rather than later, because health issues like that don't go away.\n\nJust a short side note to relate, My significant other has a heart condition, as well as type 1 diabetes. When I was giving birth I looked over and realized he was having a sugar drop, which can be super dangerous for him as it causes bad seizures. I damn near made the nurses stop attending to me who was in very active labor to the point of needing to push, to help him so he didn't die in the birthing room. I've never once been resentful to him for taking away from me in that moment.", "She should be glad you even had the energy to show up at all given that condition you have.

It\u2019s not ok for her to blame you and be angry at you. That\u2019s really weird. I don\u2019t understand what the argument was about.

It's not like you were hooking up with someone else while she was giving birth. You could've died and she didn't even acknowledge that at all and when you brought it up, she walked away.

Maybe it was something else that made her upset though.", "NTA at all! Hormones and new baby do make people act kinda crazy for awhile. It is very stressful! However in no way are you the AH here. I would go to a couples counselor. They will work with both of you guys and I think it will help her realize you had no choice but to try to save your own life!

She\u2019s acting ridiculously.", "Before I give an opinion, is Jane okay? Postpartum is rough and can be throwing her into a spiral. My wife went through it with each child and it\u2019s not a short term situation. She just had a traumatic body altering experience that dragged her hormones to hell. I hope you too are okay but you might want to research postpartum I\u2019m going to say neither is AH but both should see a therapist for help to understand each other better.", "NTA But I would mention that she can be mad/upset you missed it as long as she also acknowledges it isn't your fault and your health is important. It's still a moment she missed out on and I think it's okay to grieve that--she just shouldn't take it out on you because you were also grieving missing that moment.", "NTA, and your gf is selfish and wants everything about her.

So I'm just wondering if something like PPD could be clouding her judgement", "You could have been petty and told her you were angry that she didn't wait a day to have the baby and that she wasn't with you at the hospital when you were having life saving medical treatment. Seriously though, I'm sorry you and your girlfriend went through this experience.  It sucks that she gave birth without you, it sucks she wasn't there to support you in the hospital, and it sucks that had to miss the birth of your child.  Both of you need to have a heart to heart and acknowledge that the situation was far from ideal but out of both of your control.  Some people hate the phrase \"It is what it is\" but I love it and even have it on my phone lock screen because it reminds me that you can't change the past.  All you can do is acknowledge that whatever happened happened and choose to move forward. NTA", "Nta, but I would like to point out that she resents the situation, not you as a person. She shouldn't lash out at you, shes the asshole here, but I'm sure she doesn't actually blame you. Maybe you could try to talk to her about, she just needs to vent and let it out. I would feel terrible if I had to give birth without my husband, but I would feel much worse if he died. She's tired and hormonal and overwhelmed and that will really mess with you, I've had 2 babies and I was a hot mess for a really long time after they were born.", "Nta. What did she expect you to do?

It's not like your girlfriend went into active labor, and you decided that rather than be there to watch your son being born, you skipped into the hospital over a splinter. You could have DIED for Christmas sake, that trumps everything else. A dead partner is far worse than a partner who missed the birth. And I'm sure you were in contact with your partner about why you went & were in the hospital. I suppose you could blame it on hormones or maybe even postpartum depression (and if that's the case, then she needs to talk to someone asap) but it sounds like she's been sitting on this and letting it fester, and blowing it way out of proportion.", "NTA.

Its not like you did it on purpose to get hospitalized to avoid the birth of your child.", "NTA for having a medical emergency during the birth of your child, obviously. That being said, you already know you handled it wrong. She may be experiencing some postpartum depression that is materializing in her resentment of not having you by her side in that moment.

Why didn\u2019t she (or anyone else) let you know what was going on?? Did it all just happen that fast?

You were hospitalized with a life threatening complication, and did not learn about the birth until after the fact. Her anger is not rational. \n\nTry talking to her, saying you were fighting for your life in the hospital, and only learned of the birth after the fact through BIL. Have her walk you through why she is angry that you were not at a birth you were not informed of, while hospitalized. Then just wait and let her talk herself through this. It will make no sense. Then ask, if she\u2019s just disappointed, and mad at fate, not at anything you did? Because if that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong, you\u2019re right there with her. Mad at fate and frustrated to have missed such an incredible moment. This is why you are determined to make the most out of every moment going forward. \n\nIt will be helpful to determine if she\u2019s just broken hearted not to have the beautiful birth plan she dreamed of, realized, with you by her side to help her while she was scared, or if she really is angry that you didn\u2019t have ESP, leap out of bed, tear the leads out, and rush to her side because she\u2019s a narcissist. \n\nNow, if it\u2019s the former, she could be feeling complicated emotions having gone through what can be a lengthy, painful, scary experience without her partner. She might simultaneously know it\u2019s unreasonable yet still feel abandoned. Meanwhile, you might be feeling abandoned that you were hospitalized, alone, and no one bothered to tell you about the child\u2019s birth until after the fact. If you were conscious all those hours and no one told you, that can wound. Of course, it\u2019s possible they did not want to excite you with a heart condition until it was over and everyone was well. \n\nYou both probably are feeling pretty complicated right now. I hope you recover good health, and congratulations on the baby.

If (2) then she really was being selfish so NTA, but then again on second thought she probably also still needs an appointment to see someone about possible PPD because that's really illogical. \n\nSo yeah, I agree... empathy is called for here, but if she outright accused you of doing something wrong by missing the birth, then I don't blame you for a knee-jerk \"selfish\" reaction.", ">You were broken-hearted\n\nLiterally tho", "I mean, not a doctor but, I'm pretty sure cardiac edema leads directly to congestive heart failure if untreated so, yea", "Not husband, *girlfriend. 2 women, girlfriend and girlfriend.", "Thank you for seeing both sides here! \n\nIt sounds like her pregnancy and then her birth were moments when she was going through something that she *expected* her partner to be there for only to go through alone.
