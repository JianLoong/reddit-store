Why can't people communicate with their spouses?\n\nYes your husband should have asked you before selling the sewing machine. I also have a sewing machine that I bought for a specific purpose and only used a few times; I still like having it around.\n\nNo you would not be T A for telling your husband how you feel about the sewing machine issue. You should be able to discuss it freely without asking reddit for permission.\n\nYou husband is kind of T A for selling the sewing machine without discussing it.... but maybe not egregiously? He is going to a lot of trouble to clear out unused items and make some money, which is an admirable effort on his part. (Getting $15 for an old used monitor is way better than keeping an old dusty monitor around.)\n\nMaybe he was just a little thoughtless in his zeal for decluttering? I think you should tell him how you feel, and he should hopefully understand and apologize. If he doubles down on it or complains that you weren't using it, he would be T A.", "Nta My husband  gave my bike to a friend  that needed a bike for his son. Didn't ask me. Said I hDnt used it in a while  So I took a bunch of his tools that he only need occasionally to goodwill. He never gave my stuff away again. What goes around comes around.", "NTA - It's your stuff, your choice if it gets sold.  There's no standard rule that if someone hasn't used something of theirs in a time you deem appropriate you get to take it or dispose or sell it at your discretion without even telling them.

He'd be buying me a new one if he sold it.", "I believe he should have asked you about some stuff like monitor or a sewing machine  - especially the sewing machine, as it was not his, but your personal belonging,  your gift you received. So he had no right sell it , even if you were not using it at all. Some things belong to the household, but some things are personal and it crosses a boundary when he sold your gift", "NTA There's a difference between household items that are shared and something that was a personal gift to you. He crossed a line.", "YWNBTA.\n\nYou and your husband are supposed to be a team. Financial decisions need to involve you *both,* especially since your possessions are some of what is being sold.\n\nYou will need to have a conversation (not a fight) about this. Set some boundaries that work well for you. Perhaps suggest that he can only sell things that are entirely his possessions moving forward. Anything owned by you both needs to be agreed upon by you both before it is sold.\n\nIt also wouldn't hurt to teach him to look up market rates for the items on ebay. Take the median of what they sell for on there. That should be your listing price, subject to the condition of the item.", "NTA.

It doesn't matter if he didn't see you use it, it was yours, and asking you is basic communication,  he just didn't want to ask you, so he could sell all the stuff. More importantly he seems to be selling your stuff or together stuff, not his stuff, at least from your comments,  like if he wants to sell older things it's not hard to ask your partner prior to selling. His behavior stepped over boundaries.

If he refuses, sell his playstation as soon as he turns around.", "info: Do you perhaps have a hoarding issue?  Unless your husband is a complete AH, I don't see why he would do it unless you are gathering things up and cluttering up the house. I have a MIL who likes to buy stuff and never uses it. She has no space in her place and yet she continues. It causes a lot of friction with her and my FIL.", "NAH. You should have set this rule before spring cleaning that you both agree before getting rid of something. Since you didn\u2019t, it was reasonable of him to think the sewing machine was in the same category as the monitor. But you can definitely tell him you want him to clear it with you first going forward.", "ESH, I think. Doesn't sound like you ever told him to consult you, and you let him sell other unused stuff before. So that's on you, you should be able to communicate your boundary. \n\nHe is an AH for obvious reasons.", "OP, think about this. When women do this, it is because the man has too much \"junk\" laying around and it is allegedly a good thing. Oh, and women are entitled to \"half\", so why can't he get his?\n\nWith that being said. We can all do with less materialist items cluttering up our lives and houses. You stated that you were not using the items and he saw that it was laying around collecting dust. Perhaps there should be a bit better communication in your marriage. NAH, just lack of communication.
