Or, if you know them, go to the people who bought yours, explain it was a mistake and try to get it back, refunding the money.", "Me and my dad are in a situation where we\u2019re moving out of the house where he raised me and my brother, and like you, I haven\u2019t been a very active participant throughout the whole process of getting rid of 19 year\u2019s worth of stuff. STILL, my dad has sorted all the piles of stuff he\u2019s planning to sell/throw away and told me to take a look before x time, so that I can keep the stuff I want. When he sold my old skiing gear (with my permission) he even gave ME the money, because it was gifted to me and wasn\u2019t his to profit from. \n\nyou\u2019re NTA for being upset that your husband is selling your stuff practically behind your back. anything that is not his and his alone should be both of your decision to sell, and you at least need to be on the same page about this stuff. (also, u should get those $20. it was a gift to *you*, not your household.)", "Sounds like you're the asshole", "It wouldnt matter if she NEVER used it. It's still her sewing machine and he had no right to sell it.", "He's a kleptomaniac", "A million upvotes to you.", ">I was interested in taking it up as a hobby.\n\nOP had indicated that she was going to take it up as a hobby. It wasn't a tool to be pulled out as needed, it was supposed to be a hobby. It clearly didn't become a hobby if she used it once in two years and being 'busy' for *two years* just rings hollow. So to him it was either a waste of space or a disappointingly broken promise, or both. So he got rid of it. He should have approached it differently, sure, but that's why I said ESH.\n\nMy suspicion is that there's more to the story, if he's selling stuff for this cheap, he's probably fed up with trying to talk about it (or maybe he's immature) but we're only hearing one side of the story here.", "Actually, sometimes I do that to my fiance and he THANKS me for it lol. When I explain it he often doesn't get it, but when I turn the tables he goes ooohh yeah that is shitty sorry", "Damn bro chill out no need to swear", "New rule, he doesn't touch your shit. Ever. If he thinks you might be okay with something of yours being sold (for definitely way too cheap, I resell as a full time job) then he needs to ask first and accept no the first time you say it.", "You would NOT be the asshole. \n\nI do have a feeling you\u2019re a big trash keeper. I\u2019ve lived with 3 of those all my life - mother, father and brother - so I can\u2019t relate to you at all. \nIf a sewing machine was something you really wanted, as you stated, you would have used it more than once since you got it. As you\u2019ve only used once I would say you only liked the ideia of owning one - maybe a friend had one and you felt it was something you would like to do - and now you\u2019re pissed cause you\u2019ve finally remembered you owned it, but only after it got sold. \nAlso, why aren\u2019t you helping him sell your unused stuff? Are you capable of letting go of things you don\u2019t use anymore?! \n\n\nDespite all that, at the end of the day the stuff\u2019s still yours and you have total right to keep all the trash you want, which means your husband is TA for selling it without your permission.", "I am leaning toward YTA, sorry. You only used the machine once in two years? Yeah, it's gotta go. Sorry not sorry. At least he's repurposing these items and not just throwing them away. And getting a little but of cash too. \nI personally can't stand clutter and stuff just laying around. If it's not being used, get tf rid of it!", "NTA. My parents used to give my things away when I was a child/teenager, if they deemed I wasn't using them or one of my siblings/family members 'needed it more'. It's made me incredibly possessive of MY belongings, especially ones I bought with my own money. Even if it's a gift - or an item bought for you as a minor - it shows an incredible lack of respect for you, to deem you don't need something and take it away. Very high-handed.", "YTA. You have too much shit. Get rid of it. Stop making excuses as to why you need so much shit you dont use. Sewing machines are for people who sew. People who use it once can stick to needle and thread. News flash- \"most people\" ARE hoarders who definitely fill their houses with too much shit. And lets be real honest, you have no intention of having less or helping to get rid of more.", "NTA \n\nThe golden rule of decluttering is that you only declutter YOUR OWN STUFF. If he has an issue with other peoples clutter, then that person can have a room/garage/storage area/someplace to put all their stuff leaving the common areas and his areas clutter free. Can he move it to your room/your storage space/the attic/basement? Sure. But he cant get rid of it. Once he runs out of his own stuff to dispose of, then he needs to talk to you about stuff you share and whether its necessary to own if he still feels the need for more space.", "I have used my \"new\" sewing machine about 3 times in the last 3 years because, as we say, life happens. But that doesn't mean I don't want/need to keep it around. When you need a sewing machine, you need a sewing machine!  NTA. He has no right to steal your stuff. He needs to apologize and replace your sewing machine.", "NTA - how dare he decide that your things are his to dispose of. I\u2019d be selling HIS stuff for pennies immediately till i got enough money to buy my thing back.", "When someone regift something they got a gift from someone people call them AH but when it comes to The gifter even if it's a partner it's suddenly you don't even use it.. you're AH for reacting that way... \n\ndouble standard.", "Grew up in a home where my dad did this shit to my mom all the time. She talked to him, my siblings and I talked to him, we notifced how unhappy he was making her at a young age. It never changed anything. She finally had enough and did the same thing to him that he did to her and I remember him actually saying  well damn, this feels like shit\" and that's what it took for him to realize and improve himself. Words don't always work with selfish people.", "Yeah, better to use it as a hypothetical. \"How would you like if I sold x item you don't use often for $15?\" If he says he'd be ok with it then follow through. It he might understand what you're saying.\n\nIt's entertaining to think about the petty revenge but actually doing it isn't good if you want to have a relationship with that person in the future.", "I'm thinking I might be too close to this one, tbh. My ex-husband was a controlling nutjob, but also a huge people-pleaser type. I'd come home from work/shopping/wherever, and we've suddenly got zero big bath towels. \"Oh, my sister came round and said she needed bigger ones, so I thought I'd save her some money.\" I'm like \"WHAT? Now WE have no big bath towels, and three kids to dry in about an hour. Suggestions?\" There were many instances like that, with anything we possessed.", "People pleasers are the most manipulative ones.. cause \ud83d\ude02 yeah dated one he would please everyone but me ( he was an Asshole/ playboy/ cheater ) \n\nBut glad you got out of that relationship. You're strong for leaving his ass. Sometimes people don't even have enough strength to leave. All the best with your life. I hope you find someone better \ud83d\ude04 when you're ready.", "It's AITA\n\nYou think any of these mfers have healthy relationships?", "In general, you aren't wrong. However, some mindsets simply cannot see why what they have done is wrong until they experience it themselves. Then, all of a sudden, your objections make sense. In a way, it's a form of tough love that solves a problem that would otherwise repeat again and again for the next 25 years."]}
