{"id": 31842, "submission_id": "1850gkq", "title": "AITA for 'implying' that my parents are to blame for my brother's mess up?", "selftext": "English is my second language so apologies if it's awkwardly worded or anything.\n\nThese days I(18m) spend the weekends reading for my grandma in the evenings. She used to read newspaper herself but doesn't trust our country's papers anymore so she has me read and translate foreign newspapers like The New York Times and Washington Post for her. I suspect another reason is that she also wants me there to help her deal with loneliness after my grandpa passed away.\n\nYesterday my brother(17) wanted to go to a party at one of his classmates' house. Our parents asked me if I would 'chaperone' him. They said grandma would probably not mind but I said no because while he's had a few incidents in the past(vomit on someone's carpet and stealing really expensive alcohol), those were several months ago. He seemed to have gotten more responsible. And plus I'm only one year and two months older than he is. I know from experience that even if I caution him he still wouldn't take me seriously.\n\nWell he ended up stumbling around and breaking someone's Chinese vase at the party. No police called or charges filed, but dad was called and is paying a lot of money for compensation. When I got home from grandma's, he quickly told me off and said that I should have been there to supervise my brother. Mom also joined in, saying that I failed as an older brother, Hearing this sort of talk right after getting home upset me and before I could think better of it I said(translated) 'I'm only his older brother, only older than him by one year. You're the parents. How is it my fault?'\n\nDad quickly asked if I'm implying that it's their fault. He was really angry at me, saying I have responsibilities as an older sibling and should have just accompanied him there like they asked. Mom also chided me for retorting like that when dad was already feeling upset about it. I didn't actually mean to pin the blame on them but should I have chosen better words?'\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701083012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1850gkq/aita_for_implying_that_my_parents_are_to_blame/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Im sick of reading stories that the older sibling should all of a sudden be expected to be another parent to younger siblings. Its ridiculous", "NTA you dont have to imply anything, cuz it IS their fault. They allowed him to go... Im sorry to say, this kind of amuses me. Its like YOU are the adult here. You stayed in hanging with your grandma. Your parents made the poor decision to let your brother go to a party, where he predictably behaved as he does. And your parents are behaving as teenagers, trying to place fault anywhere except where it actually lies, with those who were actually the decision makers. Did you raise yourself?"]}
