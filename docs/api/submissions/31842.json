I suspect another reason is that she also wants me there to help her deal with loneliness after my grandpa passed away.\n\nYesterday my brother(17) wanted to go to a party at one of his classmates' house. Our parents asked me if I would 'chaperone' him. They said grandma would probably not mind but I said no because while he's had a few incidents in the past(vomit on someone's carpet and stealing really expensive alcohol), those were several months ago. He seemed to have gotten more responsible. And plus I'm only one year and two months older than he is. I know from experience that even if I caution him he still wouldn't take me seriously.\n\nWell he ended up stumbling around and breaking someone's Chinese vase at the party. No police called or charges filed, but dad was called and is paying a lot of money for compensation. When I got home from grandma's, he quickly told me off and said that I should have been there to supervise my brother. Mom also joined in, saying that I failed as an older brother, Hearing this sort of talk right after getting home upset me and before I could think better of it I said(translated) 'I'm only his older brother, only older than him by one year. You're the parents. How is it my fault?'\n\nDad quickly asked if I'm implying that it's their fault. He was really angry at me, saying I have responsibilities as an older sibling and should have just accompanied him there like they asked.

If he's known to cause problems at parties why are they letting him go? Why can't they chaperone him?", "NTA \n\nYour family sound dreadful. Im sick of reading stories that the older sibling should all of a sudden be expected to be another parent to younger siblings. Its ridiculous", "NTA you dont have to imply anything, cuz it IS their fault. They allowed him to go... Im sorry to say, this kind of amuses me. Its like YOU are the adult here. You stayed in hanging with your grandma. Your parents made the poor decision to let your brother go to a party, where he predictably behaved as he does. And your parents are behaving as teenagers, trying to place fault anywhere except where it actually lies, with those who were actually the decision makers. Did you raise yourself?", "They were happy to pin the blame on you. \n\nHe was allowed to go to the party by them.\n\nHe chose to drink I guess?\n\nHe stumbled and broke something.

They already knew he was going to mess up somehow. And they let him you.  But it's not his fault or theirs? It's yours? \n\nConsole yourself. If you had gone, he still would have done it and you still would have been blamed.", "So are you supposed to monitor his behavior forever? Their lack of parenting is going to result in him not taking responsibility ever.", "NTA. Parents need to stop normalising making their eldest/older children parent the younger ones cause oml", "Why is it always a vase, like in a cartoon or bad sitcom? Do people in real life display large vases on wobbly pedestals in the middle of the room, just like the disapproving rich parents in a romantic comedy?", "In the order of who is to blame here:\n\n1) your brother\n2) the party hosts\n3) the other party guests\n4) your parents\n\u2026\n22) you", "Implication nothing, your parents failed to raise your brother responsibly enough for their liking and that is 100% on them, HIS PARENTS.

The hilarity that you, the sibling, has some divine responsibility over your brother, and not *himself* as the person being a mess, or *your goddamn parents*.\n\nSilver lining, one day you'll be outie for good and your parents will either find someone else to blame or start to blame themselves for being inadequate parents. Either way, good luck to you.\n\nPerhaps you could move in with your grandmother?\n\nRegardless, it is adorable that you read to her, makes me miss my own grandma.", "NTA.  You told your parents what would happen.  Totally their fault.", "NTA, yeah you\u2019re completely right. As your brothers parents, it is their job to parent their child. They obviously failed in doing that and are embarrassed (as they should be) and are blaming you (even more embarrassing tbh).", "And what exactly is it that they expected you to do? Run around with a pillow and dive to catch things he knocked over? \nNTA your parents are ridiculous for trying to blame you. And yes, it is their fault.

Your brother really wouldn't feel a bit ridiculous having a babysitter with him at a party? And were you actually invited? Would he listen to you anyway? Are you supposed to accompany him every time he goes out for the rest of his life? \n\nI've never heard of someone having to chaperone a brother who is one year younger or actually of any age.", "NTA, if they're that concerned maybe they should chaperone his drunk ass.", "NTA.\n\n> Dad quickly asked if I'm implying that it's their fault. He was really angry at me, saying I have responsibilities as an older sibling and should have just accompanied him there like they asked.\n\nNo, dad, it's Brother's fault.  He made choices, that lead to outcomes.  I can't stop him. You can't stop him.  We need to put responsibility for his actions where they belong; on him.", "NTA. The blame is solely on him. And then on your parents for treating him like a baby. He's not your child and this falls out of the brotherly responsibility realm.", "Are you sure you have the right to state such an audacious and shocking opinion? Others where banned from reddit for less..\n\nNTA OP, they were trying to make you responsible. Either your brother can't be held responsible and it's on the parents, or he can.

You're a good guy :)  NTA", "It. Is. Their. Fault.\n\nThey're letting an 18 year old that lives in their house go to parties to get shitfaced and cause damage, and your brother faces no consequences.\n\nIt's their job as parents to modify your brothers behaviors by adding consequences, not yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents are because they raised your brother who is actually an AH.", "NTA.  Holy crow, man.  You are an 18-year-old who spent an evening reading to a lonely, elderly grandparent instead of getting drunk at a party \u2026 and your parents make *you* the bad guy?  You are remarkable.  Your parents are so very lucky to have you.  I hope you are planning to go away to college and have a terrific future.\n\nAlso, I feel your pain.  Being slightly older but blamed for not \u2018supervising\u2019 a younger sibling (who cannot even be controlled by the parents themselves) - is deeply unfair.  Your parents are the parents.  They should have said \u2018no\u2019 to the party.  \n\nCheers and better days, mate.", "Let me get this straight. You're parents are mad you didn't go to a party with you're brother.... And instead are mad you chose to read to you're lonely grandmother..... What fucking assholes with no souls. Holy shit. And she's the mother to one of them, and they are that heartless and their priorities are so fucking messed up you should move in with your grandmother", "NTA - In my family, everyone was responsible for their own actions. There was never a situation where the older sib was called out for the wrong done by a younger. How silly!", "So... They are letting out their anger at you?\n\nNTA\n\nYou need to sit down with them as quickly as possible, clearly things aren't right if they are using you as a punching bag when you clearly don't want anything to do with your brother. That isn't normal behavior OP, talk it out with them.", "NTA I think your parents want you to go with him, so they can blame you for crap your bother does. You shouldn't \"imply\" that your parents raised a jerk, you should flat out say, \"You are his parents. Just like you have responsibility and have to pay for things he breaks and steals, you have to accept responsibility for what he does.\"", "NTA, this is your parents failing to raise their child properly, or just your brother being dumb.  You said exactly what needed to be said.  Tell your parents they need to shut the fuck about you needing to parent or watch out for your younger brother.  You are both pretty much adults, at 17 breaking something expensive in my family would mean you work and pay for it, not your parents anyway.", "NTA.  Pish.  what are you going to do at the party - follow him around like a puppy and keep him from knocking stuff over?\n\nYou're an amazing human being for taking the time with your grandmother (I'm a grandmother, so I very much appreciate that!)  There's no need for you to be your brother's keeper as well.  As for implying it was your parents' fault - you didn't say so, and you can't help what they read into a sentence.", "NTA.  He's your brother, not your child.  As the younger sibling in these types of things, I have said \"You're not Dad.\" to my older brother quite a few times.\n\nNext time, ask for $20.00/hour for babysitting fees. :-)", "A sibling never has more responsibility than the parent of that child.", "NTA. This is perfectly normal behaviour for a 17 year old.", "Ask them if you'd gotten drunk and broke a vase a year ago would they have blamed themselves... or you? Your brother is to blame primarily, with your parents next in line.\n\nNta", "NTA uh this is your parents fault. They left their 17 year old go to parties where he obviously binge drinks and ruins property. How do they expect this to go? They don't seem to be making him get a job to pay off his destruction.", "NTA, you are simply a sibling. NOT a parent. What could you have done to change the vase from falling? Magically throw a pillow under it or hopefully catch it? I grew up raising my 5 brothers and I never took responsibility for them when they messed up. 3/5 brothers are in jail/prison/addicts... us other 3 are smart and stay in our lanes.", "The truth hurts.", "NTA. Also his behavior is very typical for a 17 year old. He\u2019ll grow out of it.", "If he is that irresponsible they should have kept him home. They are his parents, they have the authority.\n\nNTA\n\ngood on you for spending time with your grandmother.", "How dare you use logic", "Tbh if OP\u2019s parents are reacting like that I would suggest asking Grandma if he can move in with her. If he spends all his evenings there already, he might as well just stay there, get more Grandma time, and stay away from his parents/brother!", "I'd erase number 5 though, in order of who is to blame I'd say the Dalai Lama has just about as much culpability as OP.  Which is none.", "You are, you\u2019re - both are correct.  It\u2019s optional.", "Meh, it could also be that they are just keen to blame their poor parenting on someone else!", "Not necessarily.  Some kids are harder to parent and lazy parents push that responsibility off onto others, typically an old sibling.  This is lazy parenting/scapegoating.", "When I first wrote that, I had the ellipsis as a separate line and 5 was numbered 82 or something like that.  For some reason it reformatted to this", "That's the second sentence.  The first one has the incorrect \"your\".", "Yeah totally!

That old-timey co-worker who informs you that \u201cain\u2019t ain\u2019t a word,\u201d for instance, is not a language bully. He\u2019s just annoying. The same goes for there/their error-pointer-outers and those who get worked up about when it\u2019s OK to use the word literally.", "If you want to be a smartass, at least check both meanings; \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0414\u044c means whore, and \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0422\u044c means fuck. Fixed that for you", "Again, that's when it's being done privately.

He\u2019s old enough to make better decisions.", "NTA\n\nYou wouldn't have been able to control your brother even if you were there.\n\nIf they wanted a chaperone for him then they should've gone themselves.", "NTA - This is ridiculous - People are always telling other people to do things that can't be guaranteed, and then blaming them.   Such as, I want you to convince your brother to behave.  Is he going to listen obediently to you if you tell him to stop drinking, stop running around, etc.  Probably not.   If they want to blame someone for his behavior, they should blame him.", "Depends on what proceeded the accident.  There was a case where a woman had a $3,000 model ship left to her by her father.    Her boyfriend has friends over, and they were drinking, and despite her trying to get the model away from them, they broke it.    Her boyfriend's excuse was that he didn't know it had sentimental value, like it's o.k. to break someone else's things if it's replaceable.", "The only bully I see is you."]}
