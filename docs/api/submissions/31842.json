She used to read newspaper herself but doesn't trust our country's papers anymore so she has me read and translate foreign newspapers like The New York Times and Washington Post for her. I suspect another reason is that she also wants me there to help her deal with loneliness after my grandpa passed away.\n\nYesterday my brother(17) wanted to go to a party at one of his classmates' house. Our parents asked me if I would 'chaperone' him. They said grandma would probably not mind but I said no because while he's had a few incidents in the past(vomit on someone's carpet and stealing really expensive alcohol), those were several months ago. He seemed to have gotten more responsible. And plus I'm only one year and two months older than he is. I know from experience that even if I caution him he still wouldn't take me seriously.\n\nWell he ended up stumbling around and breaking someone's Chinese vase at the party. No police called or charges filed, but dad was called and is paying a lot of money for compensation. When I got home from grandma's, he quickly told me off and said that I should have been there to supervise my brother. Mom also joined in, saying that I failed as an older brother, Hearing this sort of talk right after getting home upset me and before I could think better of it I said(translated) 'I'm only his older brother, only older than him by one year. You're the parents. How is it my fault?'\n\nDad quickly asked if I'm implying that it's their fault. He was really angry at me, saying I have responsibilities as an older sibling and should have just accompanied him there like they asked. Mom also chided me for retorting like that when dad was already feeling upset about it. I didn't actually mean to pin the blame on them but should I have chosen better words?'\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701083012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1850gkq/aita_for_implying_that_my_parents_are_to_blame/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he's known to cause problems at parties why are they letting him go? Why can't they chaperone him?", "NTA \n\nYour family sound dreadful. Im sick of reading stories that the older sibling should all of a sudden be expected to be another parent to younger siblings. Its ridiculous", "NTA you dont have to imply anything, cuz it IS their fault. They allowed him to go... Im sorry to say, this kind of amuses me. Its like YOU are the adult here. You stayed in hanging with your grandma. Your parents made the poor decision to let your brother go to a party, where he predictably behaved as he does. And your parents are behaving as teenagers, trying to place fault anywhere except where it actually lies, with those who were actually the decision makers. Did you raise yourself?", "They were happy to pin the blame on you. \n\nHe was allowed to go to the party by them.\n\nHe chose to drink I guess?\n\nHe stumbled and broke something. And somehow this is the fault of the child who was reading to his grandmother? \n\nNTA - somehow you managed to skip that gene.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand what you should have told your father is:\n\nThere are only 2 options. He is a nearly grown up and responsible for himself or he is not. the not his brother but his parents are responsible. that are the 2 options. i am not an option.", "NTA\nWow. They already knew he was going to mess up somehow. And they let him you.  But it's not his fault or theirs? It's yours? \n\nConsole yourself. If you had gone, he still would have done it and you still would have been blamed.", "So are you supposed to monitor his behavior forever? Their lack of parenting is going to result in him not taking responsibility ever.", "NTA. Parents need to stop normalising making their eldest/older children parent the younger ones cause oml", "Why is it always a vase, like in a cartoon or bad sitcom? Do people in real life display large vases on wobbly pedestals in the middle of the room, just like the disapproving rich parents in a romantic comedy?", "In the order of who is to blame here:\n\n1) your brother\n2) the party hosts\n3) the other party guests\n4) your parents\n\u2026\n22) you", "Implication nothing, your parents failed to raise your brother responsibly enough for their liking and that is 100% on them, HIS PARENTS. How dare they try and blame their failures on you?   \nNTA", "If they don\u2019t trust him to go to the party alone then why did they let him go still? NTA", "I think it was a harsh response but also a fair one.\n\nYour brother broke the vase, I would have simply told my parents:\n\n*He's 17, he is old enough to know better. Go yell at him*", "NTA. The hilarity that you, the sibling, has some divine responsibility over your brother, and not *himself* as the person being a mess, or *your goddamn parents*.\n\nSilver lining, one day you'll be outie for good and your parents will either find someone else to blame or start to blame themselves for being inadequate parents. Either way, good luck to you.\n\nPerhaps you could move in with your grandmother?\n\nRegardless, it is adorable that you read to her, makes me miss my own grandma.", "NTA.  You told your parents what would happen.  Totally their fault.", "NTA, yeah you\u2019re completely right. As your brothers parents, it is their job to parent their child. They obviously failed in doing that and are embarrassed (as they should be) and are blaming you (even more embarrassing tbh).", "And what exactly is it that they expected you to do? Run around with a pillow and dive to catch things he knocked over? \nNTA your parents are ridiculous for trying to blame you. And yes, it is their fault. They shouldn't let him go to parties if he still needs a babysitter.", "Why isn't the blame on your brother?", "Not like you being there would have stopped him", "NTA. big time\n\nI don't know your cultural context, but from where I'm sitting there's three reasons  \n1 - You're only 1 year older than him, he's almost an adult  \n2 - you're so sweet for keeping your grandma company like that  \n3 - your brother is your PARENT's responsibility, not yours!", "NTA. Your brother really wouldn't feel a bit ridiculous having a babysitter with him at a party? And were you actually invited? Would he listen to you anyway? Are you supposed to accompany him every time he goes out for the rest of his life? \n\nI've never heard of someone having to chaperone a brother who is one year younger or actually of any age.", "NTA, if they're that concerned maybe they should chaperone his drunk ass.", "NTA.\n\n> Dad quickly asked if I'm implying that it's their fault. He was really angry at me, saying I have responsibilities as an older sibling and should have just accompanied him there like they asked.\n\nNo, dad, it's Brother's fault.  He made choices, that lead to outcomes.  I can't stop him. You can't stop him.  We need to put responsibility for his actions where they belong; on him.", "NTA. The blame is solely on him. And then on your parents for treating him like a baby. He's not your child and this falls out of the brotherly responsibility realm.", "Are you sure you have the right to state such an audacious and shocking opinion? Others where banned from reddit for less..\n\nNTA OP, they were trying to make you responsible. Either your brother can't be held responsible and it's on the parents, or he can. And be glad you weren't there: had you been, if he had broken it \"under your watch\" and given your parents unfair attitude, you'd have been in even bigger trouble!", "Still NTA, but this seems like a bad accident more than anything else.", "You're not your brother's keeper! Old fashioned way of saying you aren't his parent!", "*you're", "Yeah, strong golden child vs black sheep vibe here.", "We all knew what they were saying.
