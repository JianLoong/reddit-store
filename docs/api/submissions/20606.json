You may also be causing some wildlife issues leaving raw meat around (attracting carnivores??)

Switch to food for smaller songbirds, and then you won't have the knocking sound/migraine problem.\n\n\\- Remember that generally, wildlife doesn't need supplemental food from humans. Especially in the summer. Feeding birds is most helpful in the winter when it's much harder to find food. Maybe you can take the feeders down for part of the year.

So does light. So do strong odors. And excessive heat. Woodpeckers are LOUD, and it's the type of out of nowhere, repetitive noise that lasts awhile, then stops, then randomly starts up again. That is the worst. And there's more than one or two of them! That's the kind of thing that can drive someone batshit crazy.", "Migraines can create a sensitivity to sound and vibrations. It can make everything feel much louder than usual. So then making sounds when she has a migraine can make it much more painful.

I have a background in birds, natural history, and I work in the environmental education field. Several things are very sus about this story - Attracting JUST woodpeckers to your yard would be quite a feat if not impossible without attracting a whole bunch of other birds too. OP doesn\u2019t mention this at all, including the other problems that feeding birds can bring. \n\nSecond, woodpeckers don\u2019t make noise when they eat suet, they only make noise (drumming) when making holes in trees to find bugs or as a territorial display. Only a few species of woodpecker ever drum on houses, and pileated is not one. Feeding woodpeckers would not encourage them to drum on or near your house. \n\nAnother thing, what kinds of insects are attracted to raw meat sitting out?  Flies are pretty much the only one. So could he be collecting maggots to make suet?  Sure! But it takes time for those flies to lay eggs, the maggots to hatch, and grow big enough to be worth turning into suet. Going out to collect every day would be impractical and incredibly slow. Not to mention, there are plenty of animals out there who would just find the meat and take the whole thing. I could see someone setting up a trap for black soldier flies, but he doesn\u2019t mention that sort of set up which would look completely different. Last but not least, someone wanting to make their own suet would just follow a recipe online and use lard, peanut butter, seeds, oats and other options like raisins. No insects required to make a woodpecker, and several other species, happy.\n\nTry again OP. YTA for the fake story.", "But you did.
