Not that there would ever be a \"good\" reason but I do think there are situations where one kid is headed for the Olympics or equivalent and so the other kids get short shrift because the parents are spending so much time and money on one kid or even splitting the family so that one kid can train somewhere away from home. Of course not defending this but just thinking about those rare occurrences when I have heard about it when it isn't completely random.\n\nI guess the other times would be when the parents grow up in very old fashioned cultures and so they discriminate against the female who is viewed as inferior and also born to be a maid and nanny etc. to their male children.\n\nBut as I posted I wouldn't feel guilty at all for not helping your parents financially given how they treated you growing up and that the sole reason they contacted you was to exploit you for financial reasons.", "LOL a liabilty?

By \"make sure they understand\" I mean go to a lawyer and have them draft a legal agreement specifying all the terms: the loan amount, a repayment schedule, interest, and especially what happens if they were to pass away with the loan still outstanding. This can help give you a claim on their estate to recoup some of the loan (the lawyer would know more than me on this).
