Not that there would ever be a \"good\" reason but I do think there are situations where one kid is headed for the Olympics or equivalent and so the other kids get short shrift because the parents are spending so much time and money on one kid or even splitting the family so that one kid can train somewhere away from home. Of course not defending this but just thinking about those rare occurrences when I have heard about it when it isn't completely random.\n\nI guess the other times would be when the parents grow up in very old fashioned cultures and so they discriminate against the female who is viewed as inferior and also born to be a maid and nanny etc. to their male children.\n\nBut as I posted I wouldn't feel guilty at all for not helping your parents financially given how they treated you growing up and that the sole reason they contacted you was to exploit you for financial reasons.", "LOL a liabilty?

(I saw in the comments that you are in fact a woman.)\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for your parents\u2019 financial decisions. They can look for help from their golden sons.\n\nNo child deserves to be treated the way you were - and your lack of concern for them isn\u2019t because you are terrible, it\u2019s a natural consequence of their abusive, neglectful parenting.\n\nYou helped your grandparents and aunt because they loved and supported you.", "Will your grandparents be ok if they became homeless? They will eventually end up living with them and putting more strain to them\u2026 save the home for the sake of your little siblings.", "You are NTA for not helping.  I don't think they deserve any of the financial support since they never intended to support you while you were growing up.\n\nHowever, if you still feel guilty about not helping and them losing their homes, you could help by finding the best spot under the bridge (not too warm and not too cold) if they somehow end up homeless.  Pack them some essentials like TP, travel size toothbrush & toothpaste, blankets, sleeping bags etc so they have things to use out there.\n\nPS. I really hope the deed of your grandparent's dream home is in your name.", "They can always ask their golden child's. NTA. They don't love you or care about you. In fact they hate you, so don't worry about them.", "Karma", "NTA I will never understand how as a parent someone can hate their own child so much. Every person is special and deserves love. I'm so sorry you didn't get that from them OP. I definitely wouldn't help them.", "I get a feeling that something's missing here...  There must've been something about you or the family dynamic that made them treat you differently.", "NTA they started burning that bridge when you were a small child. You owe them nothing. Keep living your best life, OP.", "NTA Let them lose their home. Karma's a bltch.", "Let their other two children help them out.", "Nta. Period. Even if they didn't treat you like crap, it's not your responsibility to help them.", "NTA\n\ntell them to ask their golden Boys for money", "NTA, they need to figure it out.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them a dime.", "NTA. Remember how quickly they went from tearful pleading to badmouthing you when you said no.\n\nThat's a pretty good indication of how they'd behave if you gave them what they wanted.\n\nYou don't owe them anything.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE. \n\nTHey are getting back exactly what they poured into you, which is nothing.\nYou probably would not have gotten very far without your grandparents and aunt, so not only would you have not been able to help your parents you barely would have been able to help yourself, with the way your parents treated you.\n\nYou can\u2019t deserve getting mistreated in the past for an action you do in the future, so that doesn\u2019t even make sense.\n\nKeep doing you, so glad you got where you did.", "NTA Am all for respecting your parents, because even if they are in the wrong ( within reason) they are still your parents and deserve respect, however this is beyond that, this goes onto emotional abuse at the very least.\n\nNTA. Please don't give them anything.", "NTA. They abused you and then came to you for a hand out. The second you said no they showed their true colours.", "With parents like this, I'm afraid they would have to wait until the sun stopped shining before I would even consider putting my hand in my pocket to give them the fluff from the lining.\n\nNTA many times over. \n\nPersonally, I would make sure I treated everyone around them to everything they needed and watch them suffer but I have a vindictive streak.", "NTA- Congrats on your new success :) don\u2019t help them out pls", "Info. Are your parents still paying for college for your younger brother?  I'm not sure about your relationship with him, but maybe offer to pay for the remainder?

If your parents want support, they can ask your brothers", "It's very telling that they are aware they mistreated her. They acknowledge they were terrible parents to her by saying that. And yet, they still expect her to financially support them. They have some nerve. She owes them nothing and I'd be sure to tell them so.", "If I deserved that treatment, you deserve this.", "Amazing that they always knew OP would not support them so they could get their punishment in first. \n\nAnd yet they forgot, so they still had to ask.", "NTA \n\nAnd time you cut off the toxic people from your life. How you treat people have consequences and your parents are just learning that lesson.", "Because scapegoats exist to take from.", "NTA\n\nIf they make the comment about deserving your upbringing again ask them if it was worth it from their end now.", "congratulations on your success", "Why don\u2019t your golden children brothers help your parents?", "My little Brother (21)  is still in school & my older brother has a great tech job but has a family of his own & is unable to support them much.", "OP is female per her update.", ">And frankly, telling them that you\u2019ll refuse to provide them with aid unless you can take their child from them is downright ghoulish.\n\nI think you're misreading the post. OP is straight up refusing to give them money. They are saying that if the parents lose their house, OP's younger siblings can stay with them so that they're not homeless, but OP is in no way saying \"I'll only give you money if my sister moves in with me.\"", "My guess is gender", "My maternal grandparents (the ones who took care of me growing up) are on my side & don't think it's right for my parents to ask me for anything...  They obviously feel bad for their daughter's situation but don't think it's my responsibility, especially when they've called her out multiple times & she didn't change. Also, they aren't really a fan of my father. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my siblings, they are fully aware of my treatment and wish they did something growing up but couldn't. They don't blame me for not wanting to help. We have a great relationship & I plan to support my younger siblings, (21 & 8). My little sister doesn't know anything about this & hopefully is kept that way until she gets older.", "Exactly. Tell them to ask the brothers, OP \"can't afford\" to help them, just like they couldn't afford to take OP to Disney or throw a graduation party or help OP with college.", "NTA\n\nBecause scapegoats exist to be taken.", "Great comment.", "Comment stealing bot.

My brothers were an investment, and I was a liability.\n\nBased on how your parents treated you growing up, if your dad can't support himself, your mom, and your siblings, he needs to ask his relatives for assistance.\n\nWould you consider buying the house from them so that your siblings have a place to live? You could have your parents pay you rent while they live there. That would be a way to potentially keep the peace in the family without giving them money for free.", "Do not give any money to your sexist parents. They deserve this situation. This is called karma. Congratulations on your success. We are 3 sisters and our parents never  complained once for not having a boy. They gave us good education and we are supporting them with house, vacations,money and care all they need!", "Wow, yeah, completely awful for OP to not help ppl who were absolutely atrocious to them. So what if the parents become homeless? OP doesn't owe their abusors anything-if you want ppl to treat you with respect and kindness, then you have to treat them with that in turn. But when you neglect your child, you have no right to be upset that they're gonna neglect you in turn. \n\nOP's also not gonna \"take\" the other child too. OP is *offering* for children to stay at their place instead od having to be homeless. Which, I don't know about you, but offering a home to children is a kindness."]}
