She\u2019s favoring (?) your brother so much that it\u2019s disgusting. You did very good with not helping him, he needs to learn how to do things by himself", "NTA. Since he likes to copy, write a horrible paper with bad info, leave it where he can find it, and keep your real one hidden.", "NTA, \"I'm not expecting you to do both projects just your brothers\" alone is a cartoonish level of favoritism on your mother's part that she would need to be called out on even if it weren't for the rest of this post", "Gonna go with NTA. We're missing a bit of context outside of these school-based interactions, but it does certainly seem your mum favours your brother for whatever reason, especially seeing as she just expected you to help him while she was away knowing you had your own work to do. It would be worth discussing with someone at the school, as this could affect your education long-term. I know you probably feel like you need to help because it's family, but you have to look after yourself as well", "NTA If you start standing up for yourself and actually make clear to your mom that he has to do the work and start listening at school, and explain her how she's been showing favoritism  for years. (she probably won't listen though). It's disgusting to even ask to finish your brothers work atleast, before your own. Don't let them mistreat you even though they are family. just tell them you aren't going to do his work anymore at all.", "They have majors in high school now?", "NTA. That sounds like such a frustrating situation to be in. Pretty clear your mom is playing favorites which isn't going to do him and favors when he's older. He can't rely on you for everything. I don't see any harm in helping him study because it could reinforce your knowledge too. I think that's just a good sibling thing to do. But if you don't want to do it because he's irresponsible and doesn't take it seriously, I don't think that makes you the a\\*hole. She should stop enabling his behavior TBH.", "Your mother isn't doing your brother any favour with her obvious favouritism and constant helping. \nDoes your mother plan to do his work after high school. Your brother is in for a rough awakening when real life hits.", "NTA be careful of your notes from now on, in my opinion they will try to get their hands on them or anything of yours that might help them without your knowledge. Hold your ground and let him fail that test, it's not your job to keep your brother's grades high enough, it's his; if he doesn't care enough about them to put in the effort to have them high, why should you?", "Nta, nope get some help from a teacher or class mate, keep and hide the real anwers and projects somewhere they can't find it, your mom is going to far with her behavior and enabling because if your brother is struggling or not doing his work she needs to get him a tutor and make him do it, she has no business asking you to do his work at all, seriously all she is doing is holding you back while if he does, get into collage fail in the first week do to the fact he didn't, do any of he's actual work and projects, seriously hide your projects and work anyway you can.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course she denied any mistreatment - she\u2019s probably invested in seeing herself as a good parent.\n\nYour father is just as complicit here.\n\nSadly your mother is setting your brother up for failure with this kind of favoritism - doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t suck any less for you; it\u2019s hard to grow up knowing a parent cares less about you.

If your parents don't care about the quality of the education you're getting being affected by your helping your brother, then having someone from the school talk to them would help.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. If he's terrible to you on top of everything else, then I don't think you should feel compelled OR be compelled to help him out. You might be able to logically explain this out to your mother (or you should be able to at least). But as a student studying philosophy I'm sure you have a grasp that she probably isn't that logical at the moment (lol). For what its worth, it seems like the two of you are on two separate life trajectories so life will come at him fast and the universe will probably just take care of it lmao. Good luck in your studies and sending you positive vibes!!", "First of all thank you so much and my mom pretty much helps him in all the other subjects but philosophy is \u201cnot her specialty\u201d this is why I\u2019m expected to help and I talked with my philosophy teacher (against my family\u2019s wishes) and she told me to tell her next time he tries to copy my work", "Thank you so much I\u2019m planning to move out as soon as possible and even if I don\u2019t I\u2019m probably going to be at a military base on the other side of the country so that is not going to be a problem :)", "Can your school help with a tutor?

I can guarantee the only reason they didn't want you to talk to your teacher is because they wanted to save face and seem like good parents.\n\nI hope things smooth out for you soon, I'd recommend maybe studying away from home at a library or something where possible so you can be left alone and your brother can't leech off of your efforts.", "Curious", "Thanks\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb"]}
