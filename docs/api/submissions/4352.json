I don't think this is just a matter of walking the dog, they now have **access to your home.**", "NTA. Sketchy AF and I would change your door code.", "NTA! No. It sounds like she almost certainly did not do her job. She\u2019s likely scamming others. It\u2019s good that you reported it. Even if she did walk your dog, she still needs to follow proper protocol per the app and provide you the photo.", "NTA\n\nI use this dog app as a walker and I can promise she just didn't take your dog out. It's actually more work to fake this stuff than to just actually take the dog out. As a walker, you have to verify your location when you arrive, check in once you've taken the dog out, the app tracks how far you've walked with the dog and makes you check back in with a photo and check that youve returned any keys/locked the door. There's physically no way the walker could have just made a mistake and forgotten anything.\n\nIf you're using wag, I'd recommend setting a minimum walking distance in the future if you're worried about this happening again. It can be less than a mile I believe but with a set distance, the app keeps track of your location and how far you've walked so it's impossible to lie about how long you took the dog out.", "If she wanted the benefit of the doubt, she would have taken a picture of your dog.\n\nOf course she scammed you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She gave you no reason to believe she accomplished the task successfully and on time.", "I don't know much about this kind of gig work, admittedly but I think NTA. How was your dog when you got home? did he need out immediately? does it seem like he was taken out?\n\nEither way it's suspicious that you didn't get notifications about the door lock and that the photo didn't include your dog. That's like if my door dasher just took a pic of my door as proof they dropped off my order... that's not proof of anything.", "NTA, while technology can fail at times, there are too many things here to ignore.  The real concern is did the dog get pottied at all?", "NTA If it truly was a mistake its going to fall back on the app creators once the walker alerts them of it. Untill then, its entirely reasonable to act like you did.", "NTA, it is the App's responsibility to look for an innocent explanation, not yours.  I don't know anything about the app, but I not sure why you need more than 2 short sentences for a dog walk.  It sounds like the walker was late, and sent a report before the walk.  Well that's not helpful, even if it is not total fraud.", "NTA. If I were you, I'd also be very sketched out by this.", "Seems very odd and sketchy. Not having a photo of the dog is questionable\n\nNTA", "You did it right.  It breaks my heart to see social media posts of people reporting their missing dogs due to a scamming or careless dog walker. Horrible communication like that should not be tolerated at all. NTA.", "NOPE, NTA.  She knows the rules of what she needs to do to provide evidence of doing her job, and she chose NOT to do it.  That's on her.  Everything you describe is suspicious.  She needs to be reported so that others are not scammed.", "NTA. You know she wasn't there at the time requested based on info from your smart home and there's no proof she actually walked the dog.", "NTA.", "NTA. There's no photo of your dog, no Alexa notification...this person is not being honest and who knows who else might get scammed.", "NTA. You paid for a service it seems pretty obvious you did not receive, a complaint was required to get the refund. I\u2019d have done the exact same thing you did.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe totally scammed you, and you are not overthinking this at all.\n\nShe neither entered your home nor walked your dog. She did go to your house, but it was to take a photograph of your back porch as the photo submission (but it's supposed to be of the pet) and to show that she was 'there' to walk your dog because the app tracks the walker's location through the phone's GPS to ensure they actually showed up. These are the two main conditions for receiving payment.\n\nI am also a dog walker/pet sitter on a major pet sitting app, and I am required to implement the same functionality. The app asks the pet sitter to take photos of each pet and say what they did (eat, drink, urinate, defecate, etc.) and how many times. However, with the app I'm on, when the owners receive a report card, it includes a map, the distance, and the duration of your walks. It also doesn't allow you to check-in until you are at the designated location. Commenting is optional, and since it's just a walk, I typically do not include one unless I see something unusual and won't see the owner afterward.\n\nI am positive that she scammed you because of all of this. Even though she had many favorable reviews, she could have created phony accounts to increase her rating. People will go to tremendous lengths to obtain money.\n\nETA: Since you reported the walker, she most likely got an email informing her of the situation.
