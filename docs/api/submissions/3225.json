It' not your responsibility to house her. Like you said if she literally has no where else to go that's a different story but I'm sure there are other options for her", "NTA.  You shouldn't even have left the door open with the \"last resort\" comment because she might force those circumstances.  \n\nShe can ask for this as a favor but her reaction means there is no way you should consider this.", "NTA\n\n\nSo, MIL wants to start her new life on the back of her daughter's new marriage?! \n\n Immediately, NO!", "NTA - it's not like she's in imminent danger of having no where to live. She can plan it out and rent a place.", "NTA - unless your MIL is in immediate danger, she needs to plan her divorce. You say she works, why would she be homeless?  If money is tight, she could find a roommate situation. It sounds like she's thinking more about her comfort and convenience than her daughter's.  \n\n>she\u2019s finally going to start the process within a couple months\n\nIf she's got months to plan it out, she's got months to save up and find a place of her own.", "Coming from someone who allowed a family member starting the divorce process to move in with them a month after getting married NTA. \n\nMy wife and I had just gotten married and were faced with a request similar to yours a week after our wedding (one of my family members). Not much latter and we had a new roommate. What was to be a few months turned into 8. My marriage almost did not survive. There are plenty of ways for you both to support MIL and be there throughout the process but you are absolutely within your right to say no. Do not let anyone shame you into thinking otherwise.", "NTA", "NTA. In the slightest.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to figure her shit out. If she\u2019s been planning for years, she can take a few more months and save up for her own place.", "NTA", "NTA, your honeymoon vibe would clash with her divorce vibe.", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty convenient timing that your MIL wants to leave her husband almost immediately after her daughter gets married and moved into a house.  It's entirely possible that MIL's long term plan includes living for free with you and your wife and using any divorce settlement for her personal spending.  It would be a bad idea to allow MIL to become your dependent.\n\nInstead, offer to help MIL find a living situation that's within her budget.  If she isn't currently working, she might also benefit from help finding work.  If she truly wants help to care for herself, then this kind of help may benefit MIL.  If she responds badly to polite offers for help if this type, then that's a sign that she just wants someone to take care of her.   \n\nBut you and your wife need time and space to yourselves.  You don't owe it to anyone to house them for any length of time.", "NTA and stick to your no. Either you,  her, or everyone will feel put out, and as though it's not your home. Trust me.", "NTA- living with anyone is challenging. She has other options, and a few months is a lot.", "NTA. This isn't a few days between rentals, and she is not in a desperate situation. You're right that this would create a lot of disruption. Ultimately if your gut feeling is \"no\" then allowing this would create, at the very least, internal tension and resentment from the off.", "NTA. Whilst it's nice to offer support, the end of her marriage shouldn't impact the start of yours.", "NTA you didn't get the house for 3.

I wouldn\u2019t want my in-laws or mother living with me either. It\u2019s your home, you don\u2019t need a reason, and you\u2019ve said you wouldn\u2019t let her be homeless", "NTA. Do not let her move in with you and ruin a new marriage. This is the honeymoon period for you and your new wife. In-laws will find a way to make everything about them and their rules. Many parents can never let go of their authoritative ways and expect their kids to drop everything, including their dreams, freedom, and love life, to take care of them in old age. \n\nI am living with my abusive elderly mother and it\u2019s miserable. I have friends and coworkers in similar positions and they have grown to resent their parents or in-laws. I know several couples who finally ended this living arrangement in order to save their marriage due to parents or in-laws being insulting, disrespectful, and overbearing. \n\nFrom the way you're MIL is already acting, I can tell she will be a handful. If she needs help now or in the future, get a caregiver or devote some time to help her run errands, but don't let her take over your life.", "NTA. She's an adult. Unless she's disabled, she should be able to make plans to live independently.", "NTA.\n\nshe works? great. this means she has money of her own to rent / buy her own living accomodations.\n\nas for helping her out if she faces homelessness - this **can** include letting her live with you. but it can also mean putting her into a hostel / hotel / motel, paying her rent for a few weeks.\n\nshe is contemplating this divorce since a few years - why did she not squirrel away some money?\n\nno, do NOT let her live with you, otherwise she is contemplating 'a few years' to move out.\n\nnote to yourself & wife, if push comes to shove, if there is no other option she has to live with you, **make a lease**. clearly stating moving in date, moving out date, rent to pay, when to pay, penalties if being late, what room is hers.\n\nthere is the possibility that mil is a decent person, that she really needs 'just a few months' to land on her feet.\n\nbut this is reddit you asked for judgement and it is reddit who sees all kind of posts where people screw each other over.\n\nlike this garbage who wanted to move to another state, thus removing dad from kid's live. dad sued, custody battle ensues, garbage is forced to stay in old state, lives with her mom. who is not amused. wants her gone. does **NOT** give garbage a key. garbage then asks reddit if she's the ah for *copying the key to mom's house* **against moms wishes**. a key garbage got hold on by 'noticing it laying around' in mom's room. iirc garbage boasted in a comment that now she has a key she can claim living at mom's as a familymember, so the giving notice period bevore 'starting the ejection process' (garbage words in posts edit) is now 6 months, not 3 if garbage were just a tenant.\n\nin other words garbage's mom is effed.\n\nso do not be mom.\n\nsay what wife & you want and both of you - mean it! no flip flopping around. \n\nas i said before, mil could be a decent person. or garbage.\n\nedit: copy / paste did not work as i wanted...", "INFO: Why is your MIL trying to move in with you?

So that's GREAT!\n\nI suspect the answer is that your MIL simply doesn't want to remain in a house with her soon-to-be EX during the divorce.  If that's the case, NTA.  MIL needs to be making plans for where she's going to live after the divorce is final, and it seems unreasonable for her to intrude on your new life if there isn't a \"NEED\" for it.", "NTA - she's can ask, but that doesn't mean you have to oblige.", "INFO: Do you all live in an area where there is NO available housing to rent, such as parts of Europe where all the available housing has been taken to accommodate Ukrainian refugees, and despite working from home she still needs to stay in the same area because she does need to come into office occasionally or for legal reasons? Or her work is unpaid, maybe something like unpaid for several months until she finishes her training and she is unable to find/do a sufficiently paid job instead or doing this temporarily unpaid job/internship is important for her future? That's the only scenarios I see in which she may not have other safe options so you could be TA - otherwise, she works, she can rent an apartment/room, not your problem and no need to inconvenience yourselves.", "NTA, a soon to be divorce lady is best avoided unless you want to ruin the next 10 years of your lives. There will be way too much drama and you get sucked into the toxic shit and before you know you will start fighting as well.

Having a third person never helps.", "NTA...\nBut...why feel the need to put in the house solely belongs to you...purchased before you got married? \nHonestly...I would have agreed with you and your wife regardless ~your MILaw...should figure her stuff out b4 leaving her husband...unless she's leaving under duress~then she should have a solid plan in place...but the way you stated the house is solely yours before anything else...would it have different if your wife was on the deed?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
