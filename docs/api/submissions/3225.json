It\u2019s also a small house and I don\u2019t see it being practical to have her living with us.

It's entirely possible that MIL's long term plan includes living for free with you and your wife and using any divorce settlement for her personal spending.  It would be a bad idea to allow MIL to become your dependent.\n\nInstead, offer to help MIL find a living situation that's within her budget.  If she isn't currently working, she might also benefit from help finding work.  If she truly wants help to care for herself, then this kind of help may benefit MIL.  If she responds badly to polite offers for help if this type, then that's a sign that she just wants someone to take care of her.   \n\nBut you and your wife need time and space to yourselves.

Do not let her move in with you and ruin a new marriage. This is the honeymoon period for you and your new wife. In-laws will find a way to make everything about them and their rules. Many parents can never let go of their authoritative ways and expect their kids to drop everything, including their dreams, freedom, and love life, to take care of them in old age. \n\nI am living with my abusive elderly mother and it\u2019s miserable. I have friends and coworkers in similar positions and they have grown to resent their parents or in-laws. I know several couples who finally ended this living arrangement in order to save their marriage due to parents or in-laws being insulting, disrespectful, and overbearing. \n\nFrom the way your MIL is already acting, I can tell she will be a handful.

Or her work is unpaid, maybe something like unpaid for several months until she finishes her training and she is unable to find/do a sufficiently paid job instead or doing this temporarily unpaid job/internship is important for her future? That's the only scenarios I see in which she may not have other safe options so you could be TA - otherwise, she works, she can rent an apartment/room, not your problem and no need to inconvenience yourselves.", "NTA, a soon to be divorce lady is best avoided unless you want to ruin the next 10 years of your lives.

It sucks for your mother-in-law, but she's an adult and she needs to get everything in place before she starts the divorce.\n\nIf she absolutely cannot find anywhere else to stay, you can offer (IF you can afford it) to front her 3 months rent on an apartment to give her time to get on her feet.

Is that a \u201cnormal\u201d divorce, or is there any element of domestic violence, including btw coercive control and financial abuse at play. If there is, then leaving can become a whole lot more complicate for her, and then you would absolutely be TA for not lending her a helping hand.\n\nAlso pretty wild how many NTA here assume that just because she is working, she must have enough money to be able to move out on her own.

That being said, she works remote so she could really move anywhere. She could go to a neighboring area with a lower cost of living even. Thanks for making me see that as well! This could be something I suggest if we wind up helping her find her own place.", "Thank you! I thought about offering to help her with rent at her own place for a very short term.

Oh woe is me, living in my car when other options are available so that my child and their SO feels like they have to take me in!", "The reaction from MIL made us really doubt our choice. There were tears, cursing, ultimatums. MIL claiming that she would do anything to help her mom if she needed her.

Her goal is to move in permanently.", "And so she thinks it's OK to come make you feel miserable by invading your home?\n\nNTA\n\nMIL is TAH for basically trying to transfer her miserable condition onto you.  \n\"Fish and company stink after three days\" - my mom", "Wow, this leaves a really nasty taste in my mouth. OP hasn't said anything to indicate that she has other options. In fact, he's said that the rental market in the area is brutal. It may well be that living in her car is the obvious Plan B if her family doesn't help her.\n\nIt may not be sustainable for her to live in the area at all, and that's life. But in her position, I would certainly not forget that my family called my grief and desperation \"emotional manipulation\" when I was at a low point in my life, and I would not do much to maintain the relationship with my daughter and son-in-law across whatever distance I was forced to move.", "Yeah but he has said that if it came down to that, they would take her in, which is fine, but she jumped to crying and everything when OP tried to say no at first instead of actually talking about looking at other options. \n\nBut saying you're putting your safety in jeopardy because her first plan didn't pan out? Uh uh. That's screwed up. I dealt with too many people who said stuff like that, using their health and safety being questionable as a bargaining chip. It is monstrous.", "I guess now is a good time to share that she said she\u2019d try to go live with her best friend in another state. She said we were \u201cof course\u201c her last resort but then came up with that option very quickly. So I really do believe she thought we\u2019d be the easiest option."]}
