Good on you both for setting this boundary!", "NTA", "INFO NEEDED:  What is your MIL's financial situation?  Who gets the house they currently live in?", "Neither you not your wife have it in you to put up with your MIL for a few months as she goes through a difficult time in her life because you've just started your married life? Did I get that right?\n\nIf course you don't have to let her stay, but I hope you don't expect others to ever help you out when you're in a right spot or have any expectations of you parents or children when they grow up. YTA and I hope you children, if you have any, treat you with the same amount of thoughtfulness you and your wife have shown your MIL.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s employed, I\u2019m assuming there are no young children involved to complicate matters (school/childcare/visitation, which may limit how far she can move) and it sounds like she\u2019s not in any sort of danger, so she\u2019s had/has plenty of time to plan her next move before initiating or finalizing her divorce. \n\nShe\u2019s asking for what? Several months? Surely she\u2019s had that amount of time, if not more, to prepare herself for independent living. The fact that she\u2019s implying she hasn\u2019t makes me think if you were to extend the offer, she\u2019d become comfortable in her new arrangement and overstay her welcome (bringing you and your wife a lot of grief in the process)\n\nAs an aside\u2026 I don\u2019t see why you felt the need to lead with \u201cwe live in a house that solely belongs to me\u201d. It sounds like your wife is in agreement with you but even if she weren\u2019t, it is her home now too and you would entertain her opinion - right?", "We for sure need to watch out for this. Another conversation may need to be had to set firmer boundaries.", "Oh wow, you painted quite the nightmare of a picture. Thank you for the reality check. Wife and I will definitely be having a detailed conversation about our rules around supporting family now and in the future.", "Thank you for sharing your view from the MIL/mother perspective. MIL actually asked us what we\u2019d do if it were MY mom coming to us. I immediately said that I know 110% my mom wouldn\u2019t put us in that position (like you) she didn\u2019t like that response but it\u2019s the truth.", "Thank you, I know how lucky I am to have such an amazing partner for life.\n\nI think you\u2019re on the right track that our home may be making her decision seem easier.", "I wish we could spin it like that! Maybe in time we\u2019ll get there", "It\u2019s a taller order than you might think! Glad this discussion helped someone else on the other side of this.\n\nYour comment makes me think that people with this request are probably so engulfed in their own needs/wants, that they may not see how much of a burden they\u2019re putting on their family. Definitely something that needs to be talked through so everyone involved understands.", "Thanks for the humorous spin on this lol", "MIL actually asked us what we\u2019d do if it were my mom coming to us. I immediately said that I know 110% my mom wouldn\u2019t put us in that position. If my mom even knew MIL was asking us this she\u2019d be enraged\u2026that alone could ruin the family dynamic forever. Let alone how my mom would feel if she found out MIL a was living with us\u2026.\n\nMy parents have worked hard and continue to work hard so that they would never impose on any of their children. So does FIL."]}
