Why wait?  So she could hit up on you for a housing.  So nope her out.  Now she's just talking to your wife's siblings?  Oy....she's a piece of work.   So she can hit up on either of them to crash their place. Yes, I read those comments.  I'm like wtf when she asks if she can stay with you guys when she planned her divorce for last couple of months.  Oy,,,,", "NTA.     Just the fact th hat she waited until her daughter was married and in a house before she started on the divorce that she\u2019s been talking about for years- just no.  It\u2019s hard enough to. Adjust to the first year of marriage\n(Neither of us ever shared a bedroom or space before) let alone have your MiL move in with you.  And why would she leave before securing a home?", "NTA. If she needs extra funds for rent, might I suggest she drop the \u201clife coach.\u201d\n\nBut in all seriousness, good on you both for holding the line. My husband and I were married maybe a year when the revolving door of \u201cjust for a little while\u201d people started. First my brother, who was a minor and moved out as soon as he could sign a lease of his own. Then a friend who needed a place for a few weeks (and stayed for three years), with an overlap with another friend who was supposed to stay just for the summer and lasted 6 months. Not to mention the one guy who started showing up \u201cto hang out\u201d and would conveniently fall asleep in my living room several nights a week. All this in a 1200 sqft two bedroom condo. When the two weeks turned several years roommate left, hubby and I declared the next roommate was going to have to come in via baby carrier, if only to save our marriage from the stress of never being alone in our own home.", "NTA.", "You're obviously NTA but SPOILER ALERT somehow it'll magically turn out that it is, indeed, between her living on the street and living with you.", "NTA", "NTA.  Do not let her move in.  You will never get rid of her. Once you got married she saw you and DW as the escape plan. She works. She will have a settlement.  She can find her own apartment.  I would tell her no under NO circumstances could she live with us.   Watch out for her trying to sabotage   other places to live.", "NTA . I got saddled with MIL & 7yo niece a few months after my wedding, it caused major disruption in our newly-wed life. she was just always there wherever I turned. a few months turned into a year and me covering all financial costs while SO siblings contributed absolutely nothing to their mother & niece, even though they could, leaving me to cover all costs as SO had minimal work at the time. I supported my dad willingly for many years before he died, and would do it again in a heartbeat. but for someone else's parent? when they have others who can help? that's wrong. I ended up being resentful to that whole family, a stranger in my own home, sat at the dinner table while everyone else spoke a language I didn't know and could not contribute to the conversation (SO is Portuguese, we live in an English speaking country, and they could all speak English fluently, but chose not to). there were days I would sit in the car outside the house for hours after work just to avoid them. I fought a lot with SO,  and I contemplated & threatened divorce multiple times - all within the first year of marriage. it was a very dark period I never want to go through again, and that was the start of our married life! I'm very LC with in-laws now. SO can do as he pleases with his family, I will never interfere with that - but I made it clear that it's his family not mine and I have no obligations to them. I will be cordial and that's it.  I will never forget the hell they all put me through, and how they manipulated SO. Don't do it.", "NTA.  You and your wife made a joint decision in the best interest of your marriage.  Your MIL accepts that decision and finds other living arrangements or she stays put.  But, if you and your wife think she could make other arrangements, maybe sit down and help her to work this out.  She may be feeling overwhelmed with all this and sought the easiest solution.", "NTA", "NTA. You are not responsible to assisted her with her \"new life\". She has to count the cost of leaving.", "If you would do the same to your mom, then yeah NTA\n\n\nIf your mom will warrant a different end result, then you're YTA", "NTA if she can plan her divorce she can plan for her life while in the process", "You are definately NOT the asshole!  I don't think there was an AH here until you said MIL got upset, then she became an AH.   She asked, you said no, for very valid reasons.   She should have said, \"OK, I understand, can you help me find a place and maybe get the deposit/1st mo rent, last month rent paid?\"  Or something like that.   Make sure you adn yoru wife are on the same page here, because her mom is going to begin REALLY working on yoru wife.....and it won't be just \"until she gets her life started\", you will NEVER get rid of her, eventually you'll have to get a bigger house and then when her NEW BF moves in, you will have NOTHING to say when your wife wants to \"take care of\" her mom.   Be firm, OP......", "NTA", "My parents moved my Nana into their home when she became a widow. There were four of us girls but was really mean to me and my one sister.

I\u2019m an older divorced woman with adult kids who each live independently. They love me and refuse to live with me. They\u2019ll vacation with me. Spend weeks at my place. Not live with me. \n\nThat\u2019s their boundary and I respect them. I don\u2019t need to know why. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad about it, either (ie: manipulative Mama tears). \n\nI also feel like I\u2019m the adult in this situation and would never want them to \u201ctake care of me\u201d as I\u2019m healthy and can care for myself and my decisions. \n\nOP, ignore your guilty feelings. Don\u2019t be manipulated. She is a grown woman and will not end up on the streets. \n\nKudos on setting boundaries and putting your relationship first.

'Now that my daughter has a nice house for me to live in, I can get my divorce.'", "Yeah, the ONLY time a visit is really \"just a few months\" is when the person has a signed lease they're waiting to start... And sometimes that doesn't work out either.  When someone moves in for \"just a few months\" who doesn't have a job that pays enough for them to pay market rent, doesn't have a reasonable plan for how/when they're going to move out, and/or don't have significant assets of their own, the probability is that you will eventually need an eviction process to painfully remove them from your home.\n\nTalk to your wife.  Calmly discuss your concerns that her mother may expect you and your wife to financially support her.  Explain that while you care about MIL and would be willing to help her when she's elderly and infirm, that isn't the situation right now.  Discuss with your wife that you think the two of you should discuss any significant and/or regular financial support of family and agree together on such support before giving it.  For instance, your wife wouldn't appreciate it if you gave large sums of your joint money to your family just like you wouldn't like it if she let her mother move in without first discussing it with each other and agreeing on the best course of action.  These types of decisions should be two yesses or one no.  If either of you isn't in agreement, then the answer is \"no\".  \n\nAlthough you and your wife both agreed about MIL not moving in, this time, it's an excellent opportunity to discuss handling such decisions in the future.

We\u2019re definitely going to have those conversations, I can imagine this is only the first of many hard decisions around family we\u2019d have to make\u2026 and how important it is that we\u2019re on the same page for our marriage to be successful.
