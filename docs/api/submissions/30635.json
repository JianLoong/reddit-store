She said the kids were \"terrible flyers\" and basically cried the whole way on both trips (we are from Australia) and wouldn't settle. \n\n  \nShe has made a lot of passive aggressive posts on social media about how entitled non parents are about kids on planes and how people need to have more sympathy for mums because they are suffering more than they are because their babies won't settle and being a parent is hard. She's been kinda....whiney in general since she became a mum, always complaining about hard it is and she makes a lot of snide comments to me about how it \"must be nice\" that I sleep in etc because I've chosen not to have kids.\n\n  \nThe plane situation came up when I saw her last night. She started talking about it again and I asked her if something specific happened or if someone was rude to her about the kids and she admitted that they weren't really, people just looked visibly annoyed as they kids refused to settle and on one of the flights, the person next to her asked the flight attendant if there was anywhere else she could sit after a couple of hours and looked really disappointed when told there wasn't as the flight was full. She also said they were rude because none of them offered to help her or give her reassuring smiles and comments. \n\n  \nI said that people have the right to be annoyed at a baby crying the whole way from Melbourne to Singapore on a flight that leaves at 1am in the morning and lands at like, 9am, and she went off saying that they don't and her kids have a right to fly. I told her I never said they didn't, just that people have the right to not be thrilled to be seated next to her infant who cries the whole way and that they don't have to feel more sorry for her than themselves because she is responsible for bringing the kids onto the plane and created the situation. I also said that no one but her and her husband are obligated to look after their children on a flight and it isn't fair to expect the people around her to help with them.\n\n  \nShe stormed out and complained to my parents who backed my up, but our other sister started dogpiling me too so I just went home.  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699541855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17reryw/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_people_are/", "score": 2680, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one owes her anything and people do get annoyed at kids on flights because they usually cry and fuss and everyone on the plane is forced to tolerate it because there is no where else to go. Your sister needs to get a grip and realize she isn't entitled to other passengers helping her nor is she entitled to everyone being over-the-top understanding of her situation. Show her the little care packages that some parents make for other passengers.. not because she should do that, but so that she sees that other parents understand it isn't enjoyable for the other people on the plane. If she is going to choose to fly with little kids who don't tolerate flying well, she needs to also be able to deal with the unhappy passengers she is subjecting her screaming children to.", "NTA.\n\nYour kids are adorable and the centre of the world......to *you*, not the rest of the world. To the rest of the world, they are just another two kids, and ones that are being disruptive and annoying at that point. Babies cry but it doesn't mean it isn't annoying. \n\nParents are not entitled to sympathy and help. If you can't handle dealing with them on a flight on your own, don't take them on a plane. Simple.", "Sorry, definitely NTA. She's very entitled. What did you think would happen when you take two kids under 2 on a super long plane ride? Yes, they will be very uncomfortable, and yes, so will the parents and everyone else around them. It's not easy parenting (I know myself), but the sister sounds selfish here. Did she really expect people around her to be excited?", "How does she know that the side-ee is coming from someone who is not a parent. That aside, people are allowed to look displeased when a baby cries, sometimes facial expressions are not voluntary. She needs to get over it & ignore the looks.\n\nNTA", "I look visibly annoyed at people on planes who snore, people who eat loudly with their mouthes open or people who play noisy games without headphones.  NTA", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t like to hear the truth. She just wants pity, which she doesn\u2019t deserve. \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA, she has some balls to talk about entitlement when she's acting like the world owes her anything for having kids. If I spend my money and book a flight, I'm going to expect luxury and comfort. Screaming kids is the last thing on my \"need on a plane\" list.", "NTA\n\nI have taken multiple trans-Atlantic flights with small children and it definitely sucks, but the idea that other passengers can't also think it sucks is baffling. Flying is miserable all around.", "NTA. As a mum with a toddler, i know how hard it is to travel with kids. When I went to Australia with just me and my son, I dont expect anyone to help me during the flight coz I am responsible for my son and it was my choice to bring him along with me. Tell your sister that if she has plan to travel with her kids, she must prepare necessary things to help them sleep during flights or entertain them so they wont cry and bother other people.", "NTA. Yeah \u201cwhiny\u201d is right. Your sister is just an entitled parent. She\u2019s probably doubling down on \u201cthe other people were the problem, not me\u201d to delude herself into not feeling embarrassed.", "Easy NTA\n\n>She also said they were rude because none of them offered to help her or give her reassuring smiles and comments\n\nDoes she live in a Hallmark movie?", "NTA. Nobody forced her to have children and nobody should be expected to control involuntary facial expressions just to make her feel validated. She should focus that energy on her child instead of whining like a baby", "NTA - her children, her choice to bring them on a plane.", "NTA - and I struggle with this, because often times what this person is positing is a cry for help when they\u2019re to proud to actually ask.\n\n**How often was she offering to help others prior to being a parent? Was she an active participant in the village she is seemingly demanding everyone provide her now?**\n\nParenthood is a very serious and important job to choose. **But that\u2019s just it! She elected into the wonderful job of parenthood and cannot now project the difficulties that come with that reality onto others.**", "NTA. I rarely fly because I hate dealing with people. The last flight I went on was a big family trip. I'm talking all wife's siblings, kids. 11 people total. My kids were 7 and 9 at the time. My SIL decided to watch cartoons without headphones not even 5 min after the flight attendant said to not do that. I asked her to put on headphones and she said that neither her nor her 4 year old like them so she wouldn't. People drive me nuts with their inconsiderate acts", "NTA. I'd be absolutely fuming as a passenger on that plane. Overnight plane with 2 screaming kids the whole way and a mother who's apparently expecting people to offer to help? Nah. She brought it on herself.", "Nta it's not rude not to offer some complete stranger help with their baby. I definitely fall a little on the paranoid side n but I'd think it was creepy (though I realize trapped on a plane, it's not like they can run off with the kid.)\n\nAnyone who makes lots of noise on a plane is going to get side eye - people who tall loudly, don't use headphones with their devices, etc. It's not specific to a baby.", "A mom and someone who travels with their toddler frequently here \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You are definitely NTA. Parents like your sister give the rest of us a bad name.", "NTA.\n\nMy parents waited for me to be 6 to do holidays that needed to flight. Now while that can be not feasible for all they should have thought to do an holiday that required a smaller flight instead that Australia-Europe to see how the kids would react. Also all that hours of flight are too much for them of course they were bad, it is a lot for adults that at least know what is going on.", "NTA. Your sister sounds insufferable. The kids are probably struggling because they're in pain from flying; what's her excuse?", "Nta. My aunt brought my baby cousin (who was like what? Four or five months that time) on a flight to bali as a last minute squeeze, and also assuming we would help care for her during that trip (spoiler: we didnt: but my mom, grandma, aunt and uncle did. We (my sisters, cousins and I )clearly said we are hands off with childcare bec we didnt ask for it and when we were flying back home, baby cousin kept crying nonstop and people were staring. \n\nEven i feel for those passengers too coz it seems they were annoyed with a baby crying on full blast and mind you, it\u2019s a budget airline and it was a full flight so it was super inconvenient. I hate it also when parents cant seem to consider the fact that people who fly want peace and quiet during the entire flight and that it doesn\u2019t revolve around them or their noisy ill behaved kids", "NTA.  People have a right to be annoyed if her kid is screaming for 8 hours in a metal tube that no one can escape from. I understand she didn't want the kid to cry either but people do not have to pretend to be overjoyed so she feels better about her decision to have kids. No one is required to offer her assistance or watch her kids for her on a plane. If she doesn't like that, she needs to stay home.", "NTA\n\nShe took two very young children on an international flight in the middle of the night? What was she thinking?", "I'm good with kids and can usually get crying children around me to stop crying and/or go to sleep (just call me the Baby Whisperer).  So if there are crying babies, I usually help.  But what the actual hell were they thinking when they decided to take two infants to Europe from Australia on their laps so that they wouldn't have to pay for seats for them?  This is the point at which I lose all sympathy.  The kids didn't need to go to Europe.  The kids got nothing out of going to Europe and all your sister got was a reason to whine (you don't mention your BIL, so I don't know what he got aside from whiny children and wife).  Leave the kids home unless there's a reason to take them, like all his relatives are there and haven't seen the kids.  Even then, lots of pictures will usually cover it.  Maybe I've just changed my priorities, but I would rather have a more comfortable trip if I'm squashed in a flying tuna can with 300 of my closest friends (many of whom are sick and will transfer the germs to me) than save money by holding a squirming toddler for 36 straight hours, or however long it takes.\n\nNTA.  Your sister and BIL are nuts and should have left the kids home.", "NTA. And when you get \"must be nice\" remarks, just say \"it is, that's why I did it.\"", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like everyone was polite and no one said anything, they just didn't perform being overjoyed to be in the presence of her kids and fall over themselves to take care of the kids for her. Like, if people offer assistance that's a kind thing for them to do, but absolutely not an expectation. And of course they don't have to feel sorrier for her than themselves-- no one *has* to feel anything, and it's a very weird expectation to have of total strangers.", "Sorry everything else aside I\u2019m still caught on the purposefully going when the kids are literally the age where they are most likely to cry for hours on end on a plane to save money for a vacation and then acting like everyone should be happy they\u2019re there screaming because they have just as much of a right as everyone else. \n\nLike, yes. It is allowed to bring babies on planes, often you have to. But I think it\u2019s a little different to compare your \u201cbrought free baby on longhaul flight to save money for vacation knowing the risks of them being poorly behaved were higher\u201d to people who paid their money for their family to fly for whatever reason. Like, lady there\u2019s an ADDED level of \u201cfuck everyone else\u201d at play here. \n\nMan your sister sucks for that. Every time I\u2019m on an international flight with a screaming baby I cope by telling myself that they probably HAD to go on this trip for a sick relative or funeral and just couldn\u2019t find a babysitter. Or it\u2019s the first time their family is going to meet their baby after a tragic, long separation. Now I\u2019ll have to stave off the thoughts that maybe they\u2019re just an asshole like your sister.", "NTA. Crying babies are indeed annoying, specially in a closed space as a plane", "NTA. Your sister, however, is a humongous one! What was she expecting? People further away to feel sorry for her and offer to take the baby? Maybe the pilot could have taken the toddler into the cockpit?", "NTA\n\nEveryone else already said everything I was going to say about her entitled attitude. I want to say *holy crap* why did they decide to have the two so close together?! Your poor sister didn\u2019t even get to heal *at all* before she was knocked back up!", "NTA. Fellow childless by choice. Why should I acknowledge someone who made a decision that has aggravated my travel experience? I wouldn\u2019t be rude to a parent in that situation but I\u2019d do my best to not engage in any way until the Xanax kicks in\u2026. You know, because unlike your sister, I don\u2019t create stressful and unnecessarily dramatic situations for other people.", "Some (a lot of) parents and even random people who aren\u2019t parents need to be reminded that kids are the center of their parents universe. Everything they do is cute and funny to YOU, their parents, you are biologically programmed to think that. No one else thinks your kids are perfect little angels nor are they obligated to. We do not care in the slightest.\n\nAs strangers, we think your kids are loud and disruptive and annoying. We understand that in public we have to share space with them as childfree flights don\u2019t exist yet but it doesn\u2019t mean we have to like it or agree with it.", "NTA and LOL\nThe whole complaint reads like this:\n\nBefore: We decided we're gonna fly with our children while they are young, small, and needy enough to be boarded as *babes in arms* because it's cheaper and we can cram them into a space that is hardly comfortable for any average adult! We're gonna make it a huge international flight (this part is more unavoidable thanks to location of origin, but that makes it an even sillier decision as the flight time was a known factor) that is absolutely going to be fully booked! We're gonna only pay for two seats instead of 4! Why? Because we can. Seizing opportunities. Girl bossing. Eh? Third person in the row? Who cares? What's a red-eye? Oh well, vacation for the kids!!! Eh? They won't remember? Who cares!\n\nAfter: WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW INCONSIDERATE-- why aren't people supporting and empathizing with this terrible ordeal I've subjected myself, my kids, and hundreds of other people to?! I don't know how people aren't coddling me for the grown adult decision I made to procreate twice in a short period of time! Why would I - no, why SHOULD I be expected to change my lifestyle or re-evaluate my priorities?! Everyone else should do that because I chose to have children. The audacity. \n\nA personal cherry on top of my judgment:I have permanent issues in my ears from long-term flying as an infant, too, so... I hope the vacation was worth it, and I hope your sister learns real quick how to be a more reasonable and accountable parent and person, because if not... woo-wee, those poor kids.", "NTA.  Pretty selfish to take small children on planes - and it's not like they're going to remember the long haul holiday.", "NTA and you are 100% correct. People are absolutely within their right to be displeased about the fact that they\u2019re being held hostage to the whims of a screaming infant for hours on end on an INTERCONTINENTAL flight. They do NOT have to right to attack her in any way (verbally and of course physically), but it sounds like that\u2019s not what was happening here.\n\nLook, I fly a lot for work, which includes 2-3 intercontinental trips per year. Almost every flight has at least one baby on it\u2026 most will cry a bit during take off and landing (no biggie), some you don\u2019t even notice, but once in a while you can an absolute hell child that screams the whole flight.\n\nObviously, there are rare cases where travelling is mandatory and bringing your infant can\u2019t be avoided\u2026 (ex. Someone is dying and you can\u2019t find childcare, or fleeing an abusive relationship) and I do really sympathize for people in those kinds of situations.\n\nHowever, taking an elective INTERCONTINENTAL vacation with children that you KNOW cannot handle flying is genuinely selfish as fuck. If your kids ears can\u2019t handle the altitude or they can\u2019t handle confined spaces, world trotting is just going to have to be put on hold for a few years. It\u2019s not only super inconsiderate to fellow passengers, but pretty cruel to the child as well (especially if they\u2019re dealing with ear pain for hours straight).", " NTA. People have the right and will be annoyed", "Ultimately I'll say NTA because you told her that yeah other people are allowed to be annoyed by her kids crying. Is it the kids fault? No. They're suffering. \n\nBut a plane is one of the very few situations where everyone is already on edge, with low tolerance, and murky social rules because everyone has a different opinion on what is or isn't acceptable on a plane. A plane is inherently a bit shit, especially on a long haul flight like that, and even more so if you're cattle class. Doesn't matter if you're flying Qantas or Jetstar or Rex, unless you're business or first class its awful.", "NTA. No one wants to be trapped in a tin can with 2 screaming/unsettled kids for hours on end. That\u2019s just not an enjoyable experience for most people. No one was rude to her or her kids, though, which is great! She sounds very entitled wanting strangers to help her or be overly nice in that situation.", "Definitely nta\n\nI dont have kids and recently was on a flight with my husband and had someone with the same situation and yes they can't help it but my poor husband ended up with a migraine and it partly ruined our honeymoon for a few days. \n\nParents gotta deal but so do others with all sorts of conditions. Ones who can't handle noise with their mental disorders or any other health conditions. Plus people need to sleep! \n\nI even had noise cancelling headphones and these kids screamed right through them and I turned that music up all the way. That's how loud some kids went....so they don't always work", "NTA.  She chose to have children and she chose to fly on a long trip with them.  \n\nAs a military family we flew A LOT all over the world with children and there are techniques to fly smoothly with children but that's not the point.  Although I will say it drives me nutty when people don't bring anything for the baby to swallow on take off and landing and the child sits there and screams, and all they have to do is give the poor thing a breast, bottle or sippy cup.  Heck even yawning at the child to get it to yawn might help it's little ears!  Why do people who fly with children not know this?\n\nThe point is, people are entitled to be upset because they are being disturbed.   And frankly, literally no one thinks as highly of your little darling than you do.  Most people barely tolerate OPC (Other People's Children).\n\nI'd be annoyed if someone was talking too loudly and wouldn't shut up, especially on a night flight.", "NTA and your sister is even more TA for not getting the kids their own seats. It is the safest option for them to ride in their car seats . Trying to wrangle a 22 month old without their own seat and car seat sounds like hell. That also would have given them more room without infringing on other passengers.", "NTA. Sounds like your sister is stuck in victim mode.", "NTA, and honestly, it's pretty mean of her to her KIDS to subject them to that, too. It's a long flight, their ears may well end up v sore and it's not like you can talk them through yawning to relieve the pressure given how wee they are, and 99% chance neither of them will remember a damn thing about the \"holiday\" by the time they're older too.", "Self entitled people have no tolerance for a brutal honesty.", "NTA your sister sounds pretty insufferable.", "Whoa. *Voluntarily* choosing to travel with a six month old on a super long-haul flight to Europe is entitled AF. It\u2019s not like kids that young will remember anything at all.", "NTA.  What a dumb choice to make - dragging two tiny kids across the world for a holiday they won't remember?  Not to visit anyone important or anything? \n\nNext time you get a \"must be nice\" comment, look her in the eye, give a friendly smile, and say \"yes, it is!\"", "NTA but your sister is.\n\nAs someone who has flown a lot of back to back long haul flights for business, I despise people like your sister. Kids are tough to control sometimes, especially through the strange sensations of flying. That's understandable and even if it is annoying, it's part of air travel.\n\nParents can do a lot to keep kids happy and occupied, though. I once had a 6 year old \\[not mine\\] sitting on my lap for most of a flight when her infant sister was having a medical emergency, and she had to sit in the row with her dad (next to me, holding their sister.) She was a really cool kid and I shared some snacks with her, but the dad was just outstanding. He was well prepared with books and distractions, and so considerate of my situation (last leg after 48 hours of travel) that it made it all a pleasant situation. I was glad to help.\n\nBut when parents are entitled, and feel that people should be comforting THEM because being a parent is harder then anything else in the world then they can fuck right off because they have no consideration for anyone else in the world.", "NTA", "NTA as with everything else it's nice if people offer to help, but that's dessert. Not meat and potatoes. And it's hell for passengers sitting locked in next to a screaming child for hours, because none of us chose to have or travel witha a toddler. Personally unless I just don't see why toddlers have to travel at all unless it's an absolute emergency. Staycation until the kids can participate and remember the trip.", "Whatever happened to Dramamine??? I remember being given it for long flights/drives as a child, and eventually I associated travel=sleep and to this day the minute i sit on the airplane I get sleepy and have to be woken up for food ..... \nNTA.", "NTA. There is nothing worse on a long flight than a screaming brat. \n\nThe world at large isn\u2019t interested in being her village.", "Taking a 6-month-old on a long plane trip for sheer funsies and not out of necessity is dirt mean to the baby and I will die on this hill.

I'm a parent who frequently flew with a small child. When I give parents the side eye, it's because they seem ill-prepared and unable to effectively manage their kids. Your sister seems like the type to realize halfway through the flight that she forgot to give them Tylenol or pack extra snacks.", "NTA. People who act like this seem to forget that just because other passengers don't have kids on that flight, doesn't mean they're not parents themselves. Statistically, the majority of adults have children. She's acting like a \"main character\", end of story. Nobody forced her to have kids, and she's not entitled to help from strangers, or smiles, when she is the reason for a negative flying experience.", "NTA. \n\nIt appears she was equally as annoyed by her kids and probably had the same look as all of the strangers on the flight. Some of those annoyed people were probably also parents\u2026 she\u2019s not the only one on earth with kids. If you take screamy children someplace stressed people are trying to relax (like a flight), you\u2019re going to get annoyed glances. \n\nIf your children don\u2019t fly well, taking them on vacations with long flights should probably be avoided until they\u2019re older\u2026 unless you want rude looks and comments. \n\nAlso\u2026 I have kids, so I\u2019m speaking from experience.", "> she makes a lot of snide comments to me about how it \"must be nice\" that I sleep in etc because I've chosen not to have kids.\n\nAnd she has chosen to have kids. Why should others suffer for the choices she made? \n\nI understand and I really have sympathy for moms, especially with infants and toddlers. And I am child free. I don't think people should avoid bringing babies to public places, except for child free events. And same goes for the parents, they shouldn't think other people are supposed to help them with their kids.\n\nNTA", "Yeah\u2026 NTA, the sound of children crying just echo chambers across my entire brain and leaves me angry, irritated and exhausted. I feel for the parent, but trust me, everyone\u2019s suffering equally at the sound of a screaming infant on a flight. The rest of us just aren\u2019t tasked with the responsibility of making sure they settle.

She has a right to have kids and take that space, but people have a right to be annoyed. Nobody acted out of bonds and it's nobody else's but her responsibility. I bring noise canceling earphones on a plane and I am patient. Last 6 hour flight to Europe I had a toddler kicking my seat the entire time, tired mom would kind of just mutter stop or tell the kid I was getting angry but nothing else, she looked too tired to be bothered at this point.   \nAirplanes suck for everyone, it sucks for adults, it sucks for kids, people are already annoyed even without adding crying babies into the mix.

Needless to say,  it is not a relaxing trip for mom and dad since they are busy taking care of their child/ren. \n\nWhen my kids were small [1 & 3], we went on a trip to the Caribbean.

I personally won't stop you from doing it anywhere but where I serve the food from.", "That's fucking gross.", ">  People should not have to pay more if they're not taking more space, and babies aren't animals. \n\nExcept lap toddlers make the row feel so much more cramped for the person next to them, which is unfair.", "My mom absolutely hauled me around the globe while I was under 2 so I was free. Guess when she started declining all those international business trips, the day she had to pay for another ticket.", "> They don't need their own seat under 24 months. They're allowed to sit on the parent's lap.\n\nThis should just be illegal, tbh. The survivability rate for lap children in accidents is not great, and since they're not strapped in, they could easily become living projectiles during severe turbulence.", "My mom was the neglectful type. I have no memories of her before the age of five because she \u201cdeserved to have the full college experience\u201d rather than be saddled with a kid she chose to have. After the age of five my memories with her are mostly hanging out in rowdy sports bars. She\u2019d hang out with her friends 3 times a week minimum until 11 pm watching games and never once thought to hire a babysitter.\n\nFucking entitled.", "Over time, I\u2019ve decided that I really don\u2019t mind babies on flights.\n\nIt\u2019s the toddlers.\n\nBabies don\u2019t run around or kick seats. They may cry because they\u2019re uncomfortable, but it\u2019s relativity consistent crying that is easier to tune out, especially because the pitch often isn\u2019t too sharp. Toddlers will screech and tantrum for a variety of reasons\u2014their sibling is annoying, they want attention, the iPad died, etc.\u2014and it\u2019s terrible because they are actively trying to demonstrate that they\u2019re upset. It\u2019s startlingly loud and punctuated; an ambulance stuck in traffic outside your house is going to be easier to tune out than someone blaring their horn every five minutes.", "https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/10/19/want-a-peaceful-flight-this-european-airline-is-introducing-child-free-zones", "Corendon starting this month and AirAsia has been trialing it too.\n\nYou have to pay extra though, which seems a bit unreasonable as when you're paying a fortune for a plane ticket, you shouldn't get penalised for wanting to have a comfortable flight. Why not have an area with parents and kids only instead, keep the noise contained and let the majority enjoy their flight without screaming", "I don\u2019t think the thread is \u201cis your sister entitled\u201d it\u2019s AITA and I think she was just because as I\u2019ve said one wipes the memory of a bad flight away or can pull it out as a sympathy story for future conversation but her sister could be having a hard time with those kids and she has a sister who just wants to state the obvious- are crying children in a confined space annoying well obviously yes", "\ud83e\udd23 The gall of these people to honk and disturb my nap!", "Yeah you nailed the talking points. It\u2019s like a broken record lol", "Or how about you don't fly if you can't handle a child crying.", "Gotta tell ya, I'd rather sit next to a crying baby on a 24 hour flight than be in your presence for a minute.", "1. The flight was a month ago. The sister was calling people out on Facebook and STILL bringing it up to her sister on how bad these \"non parents\" were. That isn't \"wishing\" - that is expectation.\n\n2. No, they have every right to fly, however, they knew what they were getting into and should have been prepared for the fact that they were ruining other people's flights. This was a red-eye. People were planning on sleeping. That is just a fact of a red-eye. You can't have an expectation that a bunch of people who are exhausted are going to smile at the source of their ongoing exhaustion and disturbance.\n\nParents know that kids cause disturbances in public and decent people understand that. However, they don't have to be happy about it. Espically in a situation where they are trapped and can't get away from the disturbance.\n\nThere is a huge difference between \"You know your kids were disturbing people, you shouldn't be chiding them for not smiling at or helping you and there is no reason to call someone out for trying to change seats and looking dissapointed when they can't - they did nothing wrong\" and \"Children should never be on flights\" is EXACTLY the problem w/ OP's sister.", "it\u2019s a six month old and a not even 2 year old what did sh expect.", "You are right, I did read that wrong.\n\nStill, the ages of the kids are peak \"bad flying\" age. If the youngest was a little younger and the older was a  little older, there would be a much better chance they would be ok for part of the flight\n\nBut yeah, choosing the red eye is the biggest faux pas here.", "As someone with 5 kids, if someone brought two infants on a long and extended red-eye flight that cried the whole time, I would be giving them the death glare too.", "Whining about other people being upset with her for perfectly good reason makes is the question, OP is not the asshole for pointing that out and the sister is for being upset that OP did not validate their unreasonable complaints. In either situation, sister still the asshole.", "I\u2019m prescribed Ativan and 200% recommend knocking yourself out for a good chunk of any flight longer than like 4 hours.", "Well sometimes you have to travel for a funeral, fleeing domestic violence, relocating for a job....there are tons of valid reasons where no one is \"at fault\".

I remember one on a long trip who was pacified by \"Thomas the Tank Engine\" videos and inconsolable without them, but also couldn't resist pushing buttons \u2013 including things like the \"power\" button, which would obviously make the videos stop, but of course he couldn't yet understand that sort of simple cause-and-effect relationship. Plus, he couldn't stand to wear headphones, so everyone within earshot had to listen to Thomas along with him. *sigh* Sweet kid, really, but damn, that was a *LONG*  trip.", "As someone with a toddler and infant I agree. The toddler is way more of a handful on a flight because you have to make sure they are engaged and happy (but they want to explore and can't). An infant needs to be fed and sleep.

But I would never trust my kid to sleep during bedtime when they could be a terror instead. \n\nHonestly I do put a lot of it on the sister, because how do you have no way to calm your kid down/entertain them on a flight?? I flew recently with my 1.5 year old. She was a terror for the first 20-30 minutes of the flight, but we eventually got her to sleep and then kept her entertained once she woke up. On the flight home she slept the entire time. You never know what your kid\u2019s gonna be like on a flight and OP\u2019s sister lost that gamble big time.", "Exactly\u2014 the parents definitely feel extremely embarrassed.
