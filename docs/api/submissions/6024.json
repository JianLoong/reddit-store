{"id": 6024, "submission_id": "zz3bac", "title": "AITA for not taking off my ring?", "selftext": "Throwaway, etc.\n\nI am of Norwegian descent on both sides and my family has always been very in touch with our roots. As such, I have several runic tattoos (not normally visible as they are a back piece) and always wear a ring with \"gibu auja\" in Elder Futhark (vague translation is \"I give protection\".).\n\nI have always worn this ring and never run into any issues. This week however, a new employee started in our department and this is where the problems have started.\n\nI work in a very ethnically diverse area and our service users come from every demographic. I have never once had anyone raise the issue that was put to me this week. The new starter took me to one side and explained that my ring could be seen as racist as Norse runes have associations with white supremacy. I explained that they are a part of my heritage and that, whilst I was aware that some people use the whole Norse/viking thing as a cover for racism, that wasn't the case with me at all. I asked if she had had a complaint (no there hadn't been) or if there was any kind of issue?\n\nThe conversation then turned into her basically telling me that I shouldn't wear things like that as people may make judgments about my beliefs and my prejudices and that I should take it off immediately.\n\nI refused and again explained the reasons why I wear it and that if anyone asked me about it I have always told them what the runes means and why I wear it. I also told her about my tattoos which are visible during summer when I tend to wear tank tops, again explaining the reasons why I have them and what they mean. I thought her eyebrows were going to hit her hairline.\n\nShe has now said that she will give it some thought but I may get a call from HR in the New Year.\n\nShould I have just taken off the ring?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies, it's nice to get an impartial view point. I'm going to have a chat with the HR lady as I need to nip this in the bud.\n\nHaving spoken to some other colleagues in confidence they all agree that she's in the wrong. She's not even been here a week and there's drama already. I can't see her lasting long if she's making other people's decisions for them as we work in a non-profit that keeps person-centred care at it's heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Well, I don't think I'm going to be the one getting a call from HR..... I had a word with the HR lady (she's awesome) and she thought it was the \"most ridiculous thing I have ever heard\". She also asked me if I wanted to raise a cultural discrimination grievance against the other person which, as petty as I am, I declined as I'm fairly sure the chewing out (plus the other employee will be getting a write up in her first week - not good) she's going to give the other party will be satisfying enough. The other person has to walk past my team , who all know, to get to and from the HR office so I may get popcorn....\n\nEDIT 3: She got called into HR with our department manager. I have no idea what was said or how it went down but she came out looking beet red and wouldn't even look at me. Dept manager said to me that it had been handled and any other problems to come straight to him or HR. He also reassured me that no-one in the company or any service users had any complaints about me, my attire or my work so I shouldn't feel that I was in any way at fault but he had concerns that the other person may not be a good fit for the work we do (it's a support service so being non-judgmental is really effing important). Something tells me she may not come back on Monday.\n\nThanks so much for being with me on this mini voyage, I'll update if Ms Umbridge gets up to any more bullshit!\n\nedited to removed potential identifier", "created_utc": 1672414380, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz3bac/aita_for_not_taking_off_my_ring/", "score": 460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
