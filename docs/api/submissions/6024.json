I have never once had anyone raise the issue that was put to me this week. The new starter took me to one side and explained that my ring could be seen as racist as Norse runes have associations with white supremacy. I explained that they are a part of my heritage and that, whilst I was aware that some people use the whole Norse/viking thing as a cover for racism, that wasn't the case with me at all. I asked if she had had a complaint (no there hadn't been) or if there was any kind of issue?\n\nThe conversation then turned into her basically telling me that I shouldn't wear things like that as people may make judgments about my beliefs and my prejudices and that I should take it off immediately.\n\nI refused and again explained the reasons why I wear it and that if anyone asked me about it I have always told them what the runes means and why I wear it. I also told her about my tattoos which are visible during summer when I tend to wear tank tops, again explaining the reasons why I have them and what they mean. I thought her eyebrows were going to hit her hairline.\n\nShe has now said that she will give it some thought but I may get a call from HR in the New Year.\n\nShould I have just taken off the ring?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies, it's nice to get an impartial view point. I'm going to have a chat with the HR lady as I need to nip this in the bud.\n\nHaving spoken to some other colleagues in confidence they all agree that she's in the wrong. She's not even been here a week and there's drama already. I can't see her lasting long if she's making other people's decisions for them as we work in a non-profit that keeps person-centred care at it's heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Well, I don't think I'm going to be the one getting a call from HR..... I had a word with the HR lady (she's awesome) and she thought it was the \"most ridiculous thing I have ever heard\". She also asked me if I wanted to raise a cultural discrimination grievance against the other person which, as petty as I am, I declined as I'm fairly sure the chewing out (plus the other employee will be getting a write up in her first week - not good) she's going to give the other party will be satisfying enough.

If it was not the ring it would have been your clothing, your hair or anything.

Tell them that you find it odd that she, another employee is requesting a change in your appearance after you explained very patiently twice why it should not be an issue for her as she is merely another employee, and has no right to speak to you about anything to do with your job or your appearance while you are doing your job. I have faced this kind of bullying in a law office before, it is not fun, so hold your head up. No she will not take your turning her in well, but if you do not, it could be your job and your reputation that is jeopardized.

For fuck's sake, it's not your fault that culturally significant runes and symbols have been co-opted by a group of ignorant, hate-filled, bigoted degens and twisted to \"represent\" them as members of the \"mAstEr rAcE.\" \n\nMy great grandparents emigrated from Sweden, and it's the ancestry that I associate with most and also most resemble- I'm tall, blonde, blue-eyed, and extremely pale.

The specific form of valknut that I chose is one that has been found extensively in the region of southern Sweden where my family is from. \n\nUnfortunately, like Mj\u00f6lnir and other Norse imagery, the valknut has become associated with dipshit white supremacists to some degree, and it bothers the fuck out of me. However, it is still our heritage, and we still own it.

Be concise in your report to HR, explain the meaning of the runes, and, if you say that other people have noticed issues with the new employee, give HR those names so that they can follow up with them and corroborate your report.

Far from deterring the racists and nationalists from using those symbols, we actually give them to them to own, like \"it's ok bud, I didn't need this bit of my heritage, you go use it to spread hate, I don't mind\". We should be pissed and we should be able to insist that we maintain those things as the symbols they truly are. \n\nOf course, the truth is that it's not the racists and white nationalists who stop us from using such symbols, it's the Deloris Umbridge's of the world and their unyielding needs to expert their dominance.", "Give us an update if u don't mind.
