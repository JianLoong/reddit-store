I'm going to have a chat with the HR lady as I need to nip this in the bud. \n\nHaving spoken to some other colleagues in confidence they all agree that she's in the wrong.

Maybe both.", "NTA - but as someone who worked in the American tattoo industry for a number of years, I know the exact ruin on topic is disallowed for US military because of the political association regardless of spiritual affiliation. It sucks when hateful people taint the meaning of something otherwise positive and personal.", "NTA.\n\nShe was way out of line. If the company doesn't think people should wear rings with runes on them, they need to have a dress code policy stating that employees are not allowed to wear rings with runes on them. Same idea with visible tattoos containing runes. Unless there's a rule you would be breaking, you are doing nothing wrong. She, however, is being judgmental and prejudiced.\n\nEven if you were racist, the company can't stop employees from thinking whatever they want to think. \"This person is a white supremacist and needs to be fired immediately\" is ludicrous. People can be fired for bad behavior, or if their beliefs cause problems between them and other workers. But not simply for having beliefs or looking like they might have beliefs.\n\nSounds like the new employee will be a source of drama and conflict.", "NTA Op even if the ring was not connected to your heritage she would not have any control over what you wear on your body. It\u2019s your body and your choice over what you wear. If it is completely fine with your boss or bosses you are completely fine. Just get over to Human Resources as she will escalate this and you need to ensure you are going to be fine. To disrespect the heritage of others like this may be racial discrimination or just discrimination. Good luck with Human Resources as you will need their help before she may make up lies.", "Good plan, will do!", "She said it out loud as she was walking away from me.

Most of us are in jeans and t shirts/sweaters all day. The only time we have to dress vaguely professionally is if we're having a once in a blue moon meeting with the trustees (it's a non-profit).

If it was not the ring it would have been your clothing, your hair or anything. I would immediately have a conversation with HR and include the fact that she is interrupting your work to bring things to your attention that are not part of her job duties or her business. Tell them that you find it odd that she, another employee is requesting a change in your appearance after you explained very patiently twice why it should not be an issue for her as she is merely another employee, and has no right to speak to you about anything to do with your job or your appearance while you are doing your job. I have faced this kind of bullying in a law office before, it is not fun, so hold your head up. No she will not take your turning her in well, but if you do not, it could be your job and your reputation that is jeopardized. Your embrace of your heritage is nothing to be ashamed of just like you said, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you any differently. Also, you\u2019re explaining the meaning behind the runes, the original meaning not the corrupted one is such a beautiful thing. Thank you.", "Okay she so threatened you. You call HR immediately", "Lol I had to ask! In my experience all of the social justice warriors I know that are offended by literally anything and everything and make everyone else feel like shit are white females. Haha", "Exactly"]}
