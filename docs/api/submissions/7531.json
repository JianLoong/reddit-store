Our entire team works from home (but we have met a handful of times in person).I really enjoy the work that I do, and I love the team that I'm in. The person I want to talk about is Hannah (F41). \n\nHannah (and 3 other people) transitioned into our team from another department (around 5 years ago). They were completely new to our area of the business, and all of them required training both in our technology and in our processes. Everyone's had the same opportunities, both for attending training, speaking to colleagues and getting resources.\n\nHannah is the only one of the bunch that hasn't really put any effort in. After 3 years, she still isn't able to do the simplest of tasks unassisted - this is definitely not through lack of offers, or guidance. She seems to avoid contact where possible, and eventually, people stopped asking her to take on work (me included). Our boss is a good guy, but he's too busy to really dive deeply into this (and as of yet, no one has blown the whistle). Up until now, there's been enough of us to cover the work, but that will be changing soon.\n\nThe other thing you need to know about Hannah, is that she's currently 22 weeks pregnant. Throughout the entire time I've known her, she's been very open about trying to have a baby, and going through IVF clinics. She's had two miscarriages (that she's told us about), and long spells with no results at all. As a result, she's been off sick a lot in comparison to other teammates, and also off for a lot of appointments etc. I can't begin to imagine how horrendous that's been, and because we all WFH and she keeps her head down, it's hard to know how she actually is feeling. Her current pregnancy is the furthest she's ever gotten.\n\nThis brings me to today. We've been told our team is being split from a larger team (around 30), into smaller teams (around 5). I've been asked to head up one of the teams, and as such I've also been invited to a review with my manager about the people allocated to my team. Hannah has been allocated to my team.\n\nWhen my manager asks me about her work contributions, it's going to be challenging to elaborate - but I could potentially shield her somewhat. The issue is that I don't know if I should. With a smaller team, we will be more exposed to a tougher workload, and I think it's unfair to ask the others to pick up Hannah's slack. But the last thing I want to do is put her job at risk by speaking the truth, and causing potential stress or job loss. Knowing what she's gone through, the last thing I want to do is put her baby at risk - but I don't think it's fair to worsen work/life for everyone else at her expense.\n\nWhat should I do? WIBTA if I told the truth, even though it could put her job and baby at risk?", "created_utc": 1673911839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dw619/wibta_if_i_gave_a_potentially_job_ending_opinion/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may believe that saying she needs to take sick days a bunch and it makes it hard on your team is honest feedback, but that is discriminatory, or at least very, very likely to be construed as such.

Something less stressful?\n\nI guess NAH, but man this is a hard call.", "NTA. She sounds like the kid at school who did none of the group work but still got a good grade. Maybe she has something like ADHD or an illness, but that's still on her to ask work to provide accomadations to help her with work.\n\nFire her arse and find someone else to fill the spot. Her being pregnant has nothing to do with her work performance.", "NTA - I would be truthful.  The situation sucks. But that is part of being a leader.  You are going to be judged on productivity,  and what happens in the future will reflect on you.\n\nAssuming that she has been talked to about performance, it should not be a surprise to her.  If she has not been talked to, that is the next step.  Either way, it sounds like this has gone on long enough.", "NTA\n\nForget the pregnancy thing entirely.\n\nStick to the facts.

That's plenty of chances. She kept refusing people's offers for help understanding what to do. I don't see her suddenly becoming super vigilant.

It would also entail screwing your team over because they will have to work harder to cover her incompetence which will cause resentment and low morale.
