Our entire team works from home (but we have met a handful of times in person).I really enjoy the work that I do, and I love the team that I'm in. The person I want to talk about is Hannah (F41). \n\nHannah (and 3 other people) transitioned into our team from another department (around 5 years ago). They were completely new to our area of the business, and all of them required training both in our technology and in our processes. Everyone's had the same opportunities, both for attending training, speaking to colleagues and getting resources.\n\nHannah is the only one of the bunch that hasn't really put any effort in. After 3 years, she still isn't able to do the simplest of tasks unassisted - this is definitely not through lack of offers, or guidance. She seems to avoid contact where possible, and eventually, people stopped asking her to take on work (me included). Our boss is a good guy, but he's too busy to really dive deeply into this (and as of yet, no one has blown the whistle). Up until now, there's been enough of us to cover the work, but that will be changing soon.\n\nThe other thing you need to know about Hannah, is that she's currently 22 weeks pregnant. Throughout the entire time I've known her, she's been very open about trying to have a baby, and going through IVF clinics. She's had two miscarriages (that she's told us about), and long spells with no results at all. As a result, she's been off sick a lot in comparison to other teammates, and also off for a lot of appointments etc. I can't begin to imagine how horrendous that's been, and because we all WFH and she keeps her head down, it's hard to know how she actually is feeling. Her current pregnancy is the furthest she's ever gotten.\n\nThis brings me to today. We've been told our team is being split from a larger team (around 30), into smaller teams (around 5). I've been asked to head up one of the teams, and as such I've also been invited to a review with my manager about the people allocated to my team. Hannah has been allocated to my team.\n\nWhen my manager asks me about her work contributions, it's going to be challenging to elaborate - but I could potentially shield her somewhat. The issue is that I don't know if I should. With a smaller team, we will be more exposed to a tougher workload, and I think it's unfair to ask the others to pick up Hannah's slack. But the last thing I want to do is put her job at risk by speaking the truth, and causing potential stress or job loss. Knowing what she's gone through, the last thing I want to do is put her baby at risk - but I don't think it's fair to worsen work/life for everyone else at her expense.\n\nWhat should I do? WIBTA if I told the truth, even though it could put her job and baby at risk?", "created_utc": 1673911839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dw619/wibta_if_i_gave_a_potentially_job_ending_opinion/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may believe that saying she needs to take sick days a bunch and it makes it hard on your team is honest feedback, but that is discriminatory, or at least very, very likely to be construed as such.

Something less stressful?\n\nI guess NAH, but man this is a hard call.", "NTA. She sounds like the kid at school who did none of the group work but still got a good grade. Maybe she has something like ADHD or an illness, but that's still on her to ask work to provide accomadations to help her with work.\n\nFire her arse and find someone else to fill the spot. Her being pregnant has nothing to do with her work performance.", "NTA - I would be truthful.  The situation sucks. But that is part of being a leader.  You are going to be judged on productivity,  and what happens in the future will reflect on you.\n\nAssuming that she has been talked to about performance, it should not be a surprise to her.

Just a thought.", "You need to be honest with your manager about your concerns. \u201cBased on past experiences I\u2019m concerned Hannah is not at the performance level that is expected & necessary for our group\u2019s success\u201d Then list your problems with her & any potential solutions. If you don\u2019t feel she\u2019s teachable do not offer any solutions. Allow your manager to ask the questions & just honestly answer the questions.\n\nThis is a job, it\u2019s not personal. Keep your discussion professional & present facts. Your job is your responsibility, not Hannah\u2019s job. Hannah\u2019s personal life has no bearing on her job.

If so, do you have access to that reporting?\n\nIf you can, pull the numbers for everyone that would be on your team and go over them. And not because you are trying to target her. But because it will give you a quantitative measurement of the productivity of the potential team as a whole that you can discuss with your boss. If the numbers happen to highlight a discrepency between her performance and the rest of the team, let the chips fall as they may when your boss see's it.\n\nIf your system includes data on the type of tasks your team members regularly grab, be sure to pull that data too. It would give you a handle on how frequently they handle the work that your team will be focusing on.\n\nIf you were to see that all the work she does do aligns with a different one of the teams being formed, but never does the work that you'll be doing, that would be a legitimate spot to ask for some explanation of why she's being assigned you.\n\nAnd, you never know, maybe she actually does more than you realize.", "If you are heading up this team, you\u2019re going to need to speak to Hannah directly if she gets assigned to you \u2014 I would ask her .... what is the best way for me to motivate you & hold you accountable to ensure you are participating in our group\u2019s expectations & success?\n\nETA", ">Also, I'm not trying to discriminate her based on her pregnancy\n\nI quoted you. \n\nYou are literally unhappy that she has been absent from work due to her pregnancy. This is protected by law. \nDoing anything about that is likely to constitute discrimination.\n\nYou're also calling her \"lazy\" in other posts when it's entirely possible this is due to her medical problems.\n\nYou can't hold it over her that she needs time off for the pregnancy, period. You are.\n\n>in what way have my actions constituted harassment?\n\nYou're trying to get her fired because of the above. That, in law, is harassment/retaliation whatever you want to call it.", "> I feel like you haven't gotten the point of my post - in what way have my actions constituted harassment? \n\nYou have expressed your concern about her work due to her, presumably, approved sick time and approved time off. That is discrimination on the basis of pregnancy right there. If you've ever expressed this to her or anybody else in the organization, it's game over for you terminating her anytime remotely soon, and if you actually intended to put that sick time thing *in writing*, you're digging the hole even deeper.\n\nYou may not feel it's discriminatory, and you may be correct that her work is not up to standards and coworkers have to pick up after her, *and* you may be correct that she isn't a good fit anywhere and needs to be terminated at some point, but as you've written your post, you are simply not well enough informed to make these comments without putting your company at a large risk of a lawsuit, especially because you're on the back foot if you begin icing her out for the same (lacking) performance only after she became pregnant.", "Maybe let the manager know of her struggles at work and give her an opportunity to correct herself or get fired?", "These would all be valid points if it had been a month into her employment or even half a year but it's been 3 years with no improvement and constant offers if help that have been refused, resulting in her team picking up her slack anyway. The problem is very much with her and accommodations are out of the question. NTA.", "This seems reasonable. Hold Hannah to the same standards as the rest of your team.

Weaponised incompetence I believe it's called?", "All true, and definitely agree OP is NTA. \n\nI just think it's important for OP to understand that this might be more about them moving into a leadership role than anything else. Regardless of the feedback they receive here, they still need to decide what to do and follow through. It's fine that they feel conflicted and are empathetic towards the problem employee, but they seem to be struggling to look at the effects on the rest of their team and themself", "I know weaponized incompetence but if the managerial team never addressed her issues and tried to course correct,  it only seems fair she's given a chance.", "The thing is she's had 3 years. That's plenty of chances. She kept refusing people's offers for help understanding what to do. I don't see her suddenly becoming super vigilant. Maybe for just long enough to get out of the danger zone if she believes her job is at risk but then it'd be back to shoving work off to others.", "Sure but considering ivf and the stress, it could be a one last proper send off.
