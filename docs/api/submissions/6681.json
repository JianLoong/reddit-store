As his parents and siblings live in a different city which is quite a drive away (4+hours) , we tend to stay for a few days when we go and visit them. Even he has a fairly large family and a spacious house, for some reason they only have 1 toilet with 6+ people living in the house permanently, so there can be quite a queue at a times. ( I promise it will be important later).\n\nNow I have a few allergies. I am allergic to pretty much any type of meat except domestic birds (chicken, turkey, duck). I am fine with seafood. I am also somewhat lactose intolerant. While my allergies are not deadly, they will result in a trip to the hospital as they affect me pretty badly and lactose intolerant just causes really upset stomach. Due to this me and my husband follow a rule where I have dishes containing dairy if I will be at home the next day. If we are going somewhere I normally adapt to vegetarian/vegan diet to avoid any issues. I am also fine cooking the meats for my husband and just super careful about crosscontamination, so we have separate pans for different meats.\n\nAs we were going to stay for a few days at my in laws house, I made sure we did some shopping so I could bring some food with me which I know I can eat as the shops are closed on Christmas (plant based milk, juices, cooked turkey breast, some veggies and some snacks).\n\nDuring Christmas day I was busy with my sisters in law until dinner, so by the time dinner came I got quite hungry. At the dinner table I could see turkey, but because it was wrapped in bacon I couldn't eat it as it would trigger my allergic reaction. I wasn't blaming my MIL since it is only the 2nd Christmas we were celebrating with them and just decided to have the turkey I made alongside with some veggies to only discover it was eaten. Apparently my husband got really hungry and made sandwiches with it.\n\nI wasn't angry so ended up just eating other veggies at the table like carrots, peas, parsnips etc since roasted potatoes were made with animal fat and mash had milk and butter in it. However my MIL was feeling weird and kept trying to make me try her turkey as she removed the bacon, so I had to explain to her multiple times that it is contaminated and not safe for me to eat.\n\nAfter Christmas and after we left my in laws and my husband let me know they were not impressed with how \"picky\" I was and how I have insulted my MIL cooking by behaving like entitled asshole. I don't think I did anything wrong here.", "created_utc": 1673046024, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1058fk4/aita_for_being_picky_at_christmas_dinner_at_my_in/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seriously? You say you weren't angry about it. I'll be angry for you then, because I think that's absolute bullshit.", "NTA. Your husband is several layers of AH. Ate your food, didn't get family to accommodate, didn't explain or defend to family, and threw it back at you? You being here asking this means you're being gaslit hard.", "NTA - it\u2019s a medical issue, your husband is the biggest AH here for 1. Eating your turkey when he knows its purpose, and 2. Not defending your medical condition to his Mom.\n\nEdit: I grammar good", "NTA - however your husband is an AH for 2 reasons here. Firstly, he ate the prepared food you had for yourself because he was hungry? There was literally nothing else in this world he could have eaten? He just HAD to eat YOUR turkey? \n\nSecondly, he's an AH for not standing up for you with his mom/family when he knows the issue you deal with, especially after FIVE years of marriage. And to side with them? What in the actual what?\n\nYou're not even a picky eater! You literally just avoid the foods you cannot even eat! \n\nShame on everyone here except you OP.", "NTA having food allergies and intolerances doesn\u2019t make you an entitled asshole. He is tho for eating the safe food you brought. A giant one at that and then coming at you when HE KNOWS about your issues instead of standing up for you with MIL", "NTA - Tell hubby you & internet strangers were greatly unimpressed with him eating the food you both know met your diet needs. This selfish act caused you to be under a microscope of what you did and did not eat. You are not PICKY. You are smart navigating health issues connected to your food intake.", "NTA but l can' say the same about your husband. Is this the first time he has eaten with you? All this time, did he think you're just a picky eater? Does he not understand the definition of \"allergy\"?", "NTA.\n\nYou have food allergies that can land you in the hospital. Not eating foods that land you in the hospital is not \"being picky\", it's self discipline. Your in-laws know of your allergies, and obviously don't care. They're AHs.\n\nYour husband is a Grade A #1 AH to the nth degree. He stuffed his selfish face with the food you bought specifically to ensure there was something you could eat. They he had the audacity to join his family in claiming you were picky?!? WTF!", "NTA\n\nYour husband knew about your allergy & still he ate the veggies you kept aside for yourself without bothering to replace, ask or even thought to offer you anything apart from turkey as well as blamed you for being picky eater siding with his family.\n\nHe is an AH", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws need to grow up or read about cross-contamination\n\nYour husband is pretty thoughtless", "NTA. Your husband is though for using up the food you specifically brought for your allergies and not telling you even. And then not defending you to his parents.\nYou can\u2019t help how your body reacts.", "NTA if this is a medical issue.  And why did your husband eat your Turkey knowing you would not be able to eat later.  And then get mad at you for not eating.\n\nI do wonder if your husband questions your \u201callergies\u201d and if this wasn\u2019t a test.  Otherwise why would he not be defending you if your health is at stake.", "NTA. It\u2019s not entitled behavior if you can end up in a hospital because of that food.\n\nI also want to clarify: you said this was your second celebration with the the in-laws. Did MIL know about your dietary restrictions before this dinner? If she didn\u2019t, I understand that she could have felt awkward that she can\u2019t give you any of the food that she made. But if she already knew I\u2019m kinda surprised she didn\u2019t make a small food option (or a few) that would be good on your stomach? That\u2019s what I do, if I know about dietary needs/allergies of my guests", "NTA. Your husband is TA. First he eats the food you brought specifically for this situation. Second, it's clear your MIL just doesn't understand your allergies and he should have explained the health consequences to her (most importantly, that the one toilet in the house would be out of commission for hours so the whole family should actually thank you for being so prudent) instead of explaining her perception to you.  \n\nThere are so many posts on this sub where misunderstandings between people and their in-laws escalated out of control because the middleman (the spouse/child) failed to run proper interference.  Its not like you're going to tell your MIL \"no offense, but not everything needs to be covered in bacon and all the dairy will literally explode out of me\" but a son *can* be more frank with his mother and add a \"I promise she's not picky, she would love to eat your baconator bird but medically has no choice\" assurance.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't say in-laws are either, sometimes people without allergies are not able to understand their real impact on those who suffer them.\n\nHowever your husband is by a long way. He ATE your safe food, then complained that you didn't eat food he knows would make you sick.", "NTA- You have sensitive allergies & can not eat the food. Its not like you don\u2019t like green beans because it\u2019s green or the taste of mashed potatoes, you can get sick. It\u2019s extremely unsettling and uncomfortable to have people try to shove food down your throat you can not eat. You tried your best not to make a scene & eat what you could. You showed your manners and respect to his family. Unfortunately it was not reciprocated.", "NTA. Honestly E S H accept for you. Your husband was completely inconsiderate to have eaten the meat you brought for yourself when he could have snacked on LITERALLY anything else. And then he didn't move a finger to defend you while your in-laws pressured you into eating something that will make you sick, and could even land you in the hospital. You went to EVERY expense not to inconvenience anyone. You never requested they cook something specific that you could eat, you just brought your own food that you knew was safe, and then were unable to eat it.\n\nNext year, I would pass unless they all make some sort of effort to accommodate you.", "I'm hopping hubby was using air quotations and being scarcastic otherwise you have a in-law and hubby A* issue", "NTA. Beyond me why he would eat the food you bought for this exact reason knowing fine well you have a limited diet, so he should be the one to tell his family that it\u2019s his fault for eating the food that was 100% safe for you to eat. Having allergies isn\u2019t being a picky eater", "NTA, my wife has food allergies as bad as yours, she can only eat seafoid and eggs, and is allergic to all things dairy, so I feel your pain on the cross contamination issues. Your MIL is T A for not just accepting that your thankful for her attempt, but this is the reason why you can't eat. As a side note, honestly your husband is a bit T A for eating the food you brought so that you knew you'd have something to eat while there.", "NTA-Your condition of what you can and can't eat was well-known to the hubster and you even went and got groceries to sustain you.  I think your husband is weirdly not getting that your allergies are not something you can turn on and off like a switch. It's a lifelong thing and he needs to educate himself on what that means for you if he can't grasp that now.", "NTA. Next time you stay in a hotel and eat your safe foods before you go to the ILs for dinner.\n\n\"Oh, you're not eating?\"\n\n\"No, MIL, I don't want to end up in the hospital. The foods you cook are not safe for me to eat. I thought I explained that to you, but here we are.\"\n\nYour husband is a ginormous asshole. Maybe next time you should stay home and let him go by himself.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that your husband is so willing to remove the safe backups you prepare for yourself and then judge and shame you for not being able to eat other food is extremely concerning to me. As someone with an anaphylactic allergy, I cannot stand people who \u201cdon\u2019t get\u201d allergies, even \u201cmild\u201d ones that don\u2019t cause anaphylaxis. I think you need to have a very serious discussion with him about the importance of food safety for you (and others with allergies), and take a long discerning look at the way he has treated/reacted to your diet in the past.", "NTA.  Half my family has food allergies so I completely sympathize.  Some people weirdly either don't understand or don't want to understand that there's a big difference between allergies and preferences.\n\nYour husband should have defended you to his family.  Either he doesn't take your allergies seriously or he is way too influenced by his family.  Both are a problem so I'd try to find out what's going on under the surface here.", "NTA.  You did everything you possibly could to not cause a fuss or make them feel bad, and still they ignored your sickness - do they just not believe you, or do they not care?\nYour husband should have taken the responsibility to tell them beforehand, and defend you if they complained.", "Nta. It's not entitled to have allergies. The feck? And he ate your safe food? You're with a man that doesn't respect you.", "NTA. I is abusive to pressure someone to eat stuff that will make them sick. Your MIL is a bully, and so are most of your inlaws. You should have eaten a good deal of dairy, though, and proceeded to \"fart in their general direction\". Unfortunately, that would probably have been quite painful for you, so not really an option. You'll just have to refrain from partaking in their meals for the future, and tell them why. Preferably let your HB tell them, though. It's his job to have your back and keep his people in line.", "NTA even if you don't have any allergies you don't have to eat her turkey wrapped bacon if you don't want to.", "NTA - you have allergies, WTF is wrong with your MIL? Offended that you won't eat something that would send you to the hospital?\n\nI hope your husband is not on their side because that would honestly make him an AH too. Gotta hand it to you OP, this isn't the wackiest situation i've seen here today but your MIL if definitely on one of the weirder AH trains. \n\nSorry your MIL sucks. Best of luck, really hope you husband takes your side.", "NTA. Food allergies are not something to mess around with and your husband should have stood up for you instead of eating your food and telling you how entitled his family found you to be. Why do people not understand how severe allergies can be?", "Question\u2026 did MIL know about your allergies, before hand? You mention having made the visit in the past. So is she aware and still calls it \u201cpicky eating\u201d and won\u2019t accommodate (not that she\u2019s obligated too accommodate, but a good host will try - imo). And if she wasn\u2019t aware, why didn\u2019t she get a heads up before hand?\n\nAll in all, your husband should have defended you. And (saw your other comment on his eating needs) should have prepared himself just as you did, instead of eating your food. He\u2019s the asshole in this scenario.", "NTA and instead of having a food allergy, you should be having a husband allergy", "NTA. But what\u2019s up with your husband eating your food? Really not cool, especially since he\u2019s aware of your allergy issues.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is it about ALLERGIES that some people just cannot get through their heads? This isn't picky eating. It's following necessary dietary restrictions.\n\nYour MIL and your husband are the only assholes that I see here.", "NTA. It\u2019s not picky eating when it\u2019s a medical necessity and your husband needs to pull his head in too since he ate the food you planned on having and if he hadn\u2019t this entire situation wouldn\u2019t have occurred.", "I hate these 'just pick out the nuts' people. NTA", "\"What did she say when you informed her that I have a medical condition and it is incorrect to characterize what I'm doing as 'being picky'? And what about when you told her how silly it is to feel 'insulted' and that, if she is interested, I would be happy to explain the details of my health restrictions? And I'm sure you also reassured her that I wasn't offended by her error, but I *was* quite put off by her rudeness in repeatedly pressuring me to eat food that isn't safe for me.\"\n\nNTA. Your husband did his mother no favors by humoring her misconceptions and not helping her to understand the situation immediately. That's an act of cowardice, but doesn't directly make him an AH\n\nWhat makes him an AH is characterizing what you did as \"entitled\" and calling you an AH.\n\nI don't know how the rest of your relationship is going, but if I were in your shoes, I certainly wouldn't consider visiting the in-laws again until your husband straightens out the situation, apologizes, and commits to fully supporting you going forward", "NTA.\n\nIf you are that severely allergic, you need to do your own food prep and bring your own meals.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sucks but it\u2019s life. Husband is the AH for eating OP\u2019s food.", "NTA, he shouldn\u2019t have let his Mom text you. He should\u2019ve defended your instead. He made a choice to not rock the boat with his Mom and then let you deal with the fall out. This makes him a bad husband at this point in time.", "im 1000% sure he knew she was wrapping the turkey in bacon   \n1. its his mother he knows exactly how she cooks she probably does it every year   \n\n\nhe could also have mentioned it knowing that she does this but she didnt   \n\n\nim also pretty sure that the reason you bought the turkey in the first place is because he probably mentioned that this is how she cooks it before which triggered your reaction to buying it in the first place   \n\n\ndid he really need ot eat the whole turkey breast   \nbtw im allergic to animal products and gluten so if some meat eater had consumed the food i brought well my hangry psycho b$$$h side would have taken over ....it would not have gone down well you let him off lightly i mean if anyone is supposed to be your advocate its him .... you didnt even get mad at him for consuming YOUR food leaving you with nothing he knew what he was doing but he didnt care he only cared about himself ... he didnt need a turkey sandwich he could have had a different sandwich ... he was gonna be sitting down to a whole turkey based meal, he could have eaten something different", "He doesn\u2019t take it seriously because it was \u201da while ago\u201d? Has he had a brain injury that causes memory loss?", "No matter how much you make excuses for him, your husband is still the A H.  He should have replaced your food or at least told you he ate it. That\u2019s what a grown up does. He should be taking ownership of his own health needs and God Forbid! maybe helping you with yours. But then he\u2019d have to think about someone other than himself (another grown up behaviour)", "NTA but may I suggest you avoid loaded words like \"contaminated\" when referring to food that is perfectly edible for someone without your allergies?  From her perspective, you accused her of serving contaminated food to her family. That's rather insulting.  And she reacted defensively.  There was nothing wrong with the turkey - there is something wrong with your eating it.  I wouldn't be surprised if she truly thought that taking the bacon off fixed everything.   If you had explained that removing the bacon wasn't sufficient to prevent your having an allergic reaction, it might have gone over better and she might have a better understanding of your needs.", "Oh I understand it (my partner has her fair share of allergies). But it doesn't excuse it.\n\nIs the mother expected to remember the allergy a year later? No.\n\nBut the husband should be making sure she is aware before the event. And if they care, allergies are something you make an effort to remember or ask about.\n\nDoes the mother need to re-arrange their entire Xmas plan to accommodate an allergy they rarely deal with? No.\n\nBut then she needs to either not invite the person with said allergies, or be understanding when they make their own alternatives. Which neither her nor the husband were.", "NTA Your husband is either very obtuse or self centered. I\u2019m sorry.", "You're NTA, but your husband is x a million.  He knew that food was for you, and for a valid reason, allergies, not because youre *picky\".  I don't understand why you're NOT angry with him. His actions were inconsiderate af.", "NTA.\n\nI'm seeing not just a red flag but a whole Soviet Parade there. Stay away from that family or AT LEAST be extra careful. \n\nI'm willing to bet that next time you're going to be told something was made with different ingredients than actually was and suddenly they will be all surprised pikachu you need to go to hospital.", "This time NTA, but I am mad at your husband. You did the courteous thing- you brought safe food for a real allergy that could have uncomfortable consequences for everyone. \n\nI've been there. For 6 weeks almost anything I ate spend through me recklessly.  Because of work, I couldnt eat all day until I got home to my safe place... called it forced intermittent fasting.\n\nJust remind husband that this would have been avoided had he remembered why you brought safe food.", "NTA.... you're allergic! End of story. They should understand that if nothing else!", "NTA. Allergies =/= pickiness. At all. Biggest AH here is hubby though, who knows full well the extent and details of your allergy and both ate all of your safe meat and chose to be the messenger of ILs (alleged) disapproval instead of sticking up for you. ILs might just be slow learners, but hubby seems nigh malicious", "NTA. I have food allergies and my brother had Chron's, is lactose intolerant, and no gall bladder. He can't have red meat, red colored foods (like beets or red dye), or anything with fat or dairy, I can't have any soy or lamb. This makes cooking for both of us difficult. I have a house and love to cook, so holiday meals are at my house (have been for the last 20 years). I always make sure there is a main and sides he can eat with a full discussion of the menu ahead of time. \n\nWhen we invited my vegetarian friend to join us, I spent 2 hours planning with him what he can eat and what he likes. I changed two recipes so they were vegetarian and he could eat them. He'd been raised vegetarian, so meat protein (even small amounts) made him very sick. I was taught if you invite someone over for a meal, you make sure they can eat that meal. I'm sorry your MIL didn't get the memo.", "Nta you have a hubby problem as he shouldn\u2019t have eaten your food and he should have defended you with MIL", "To be perfectly accurate, he told her they weren't impressed. Not that I am impressed by the husband, either.", "Nah she should suffer and get sick or hospitalized as to not insult his mom - sarcasm of course", "If he was doing his job as your husband, he would have told your MIL that she was being ridiculous. That expecting you to make yourself sick to make her feel good about herself is unacceptable and selfish. And then he would have told her not to say anything to you. It\u2019s his family, it\u2019s his job to deal with and protect you from the crazy.", "I mean, in this specific situation he should've prepared as you did. But between your joint food issues and MILs rules I'd just opt out of family meals at her place", "And after the reaction OP would have had they will be like \"oh so it is true then, you could have told us it was this bad\"", "At least hospital staff would have fed her without trying to kill her with stuff she's allergic to.", "Contaminated is the correct medical word when discussing a food allergen... OP didnt consider that she would have to figure out what to eat because she was intelligent enough to pack an allergen free meal.", "Contaminated is the appropriate term to describe a dish that contains even trace amounts of an allergen."]}
