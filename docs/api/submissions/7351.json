So block them all and treat them like non-family.\n\nI speak from experience, our Uncle (Dad's brother) disliked our mother, and us (me and siblings). Reason for why they considered us beneath them is because we have black in our DNA, our family is Hispanic.  The thing is our mother's grandmother (great-grandmother) was full blood Aztec Indian from Mexico, our grandmother had the Indian features, our mother did too and some of us siblings features resemble our grandmother, siblings and I are light-skinned. However to our Uncle and cousins we are black and despised us, cousins and their children have continued with their hate to present day, our parents, Uncle and Aunt have all passed away. The ironic thing is when our paternal great- grandparents with our paternal grandparents came to the  Texas, USA from Mexico our paternal great-grandfather is listed as black, paperwork is from 1904. \n\nMy maternal grandparents came to Texas from Mexico in early 1920's, maternal grandfather had white skin and blue eyes, maternal grandmother brown eyes and black hair, native American looks.\n\nSorry for long rant, just wanted to make the point that your Aunt, Uncle and cousins will always be hateful. Go NC and remove yourself from their toxic ways, as for your Dad, he can visit them but don't allow his family back in you and your Mom's presence. We never interact with my Uncle's family at all yet they constantly insult and criticize us still, word gets back to us and all I say is that it has been years since I have seen or spoken to them, yet toxic family speaks as though it was yesterday we had seen them.", "You were simply empathizing with her misery in your home; so much that you immediately rescued her and helped her escape with all her things so she could get a nice hotel room.  Right?  \n\nLet everyone know she was do overwrought that you didn\u2019t want her suffering a second more than it would take to liberate her.

Hint: the aunt and uncle were aggressive. \n\nWhat exactly makes you think these people deserve a single thing after years of disgusting behaviour?", "Yes I'm older and I got thrown out of my BILs home For backing up his daughter on Social Media when his Trump loving BIL told her he wanted her dead.

We tried.  BIL doubled down on my Trans Spouse.  \n\nMy parents once got thrown out of a home for suggesting how to refit some pipes that were leaking - BIL took it to mean they were trying to talk down to him (Suprise - not what my Dad - a really kind person would have ever intended).  Dude came from an Alcoholic family and just didn't know nice.  \n\nIf people used words to express what they were feeling instead of a good old \"Get out of my house\" more relationships would grow and change.\n\nMy parents faired far better than I did because they just rode it out and didn't have a whole political mess to deal with. Plus perhaps their generation was just wiser.  Who knows?\n\nThe only time you should throw someone out of your home is if you figure you're going to commit physical violence if you don't - or if you find it's an unworkable issue.  \n\nSounds like this person never even broached the topic until that moment.", "Oh absolutely everyone should just start throwing relatives out of their homes if they overhear something unpleasant that wasn't intended for their ears. /s   \nCome on now.  \nThey bodily took items that didn't belong to them and stuffed them into a suitcase (which is right next door to assault). Handling items that aren't yours in that fashion? Toxic.   This sort of behavior escalates.  And was unnecessary.    \n\n\nI get that it was years of comments - and you know what? They could have said something the first time or the second - instead of letting it build to \"I think I'm gonna throw grown relatives out of my home\".  \n\n\nThat's the adult approach.  \n\n\nThen if they double down? Then you do not have them return.  Simple.    \n\n\nThrowing two people out of your home after packing their suitcases for them is overkill IMHO - there were much lesser steps that could have been taken.  ie Ask them to leave.    \n\n\nI don't think this person knows there are steps between \"Explosion\" and \"Work it out\".    And they went full Tilt.  \n\n\nAnd yes this behavior is usually toxically masculine because we teach boys that this is somehow socially acceptable.
