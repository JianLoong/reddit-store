You\u2019re still a kid. You can\u2019t be expected to happily waltz into a situation adults are professionally trained to handle. I\u2019m sure finding care is difficult for your aunt but she can\u2019t expect you to hold that responsibility.", "Depending on the age of your cousin those bruises could go from a toddler sized ouch to a teenager sized actual danger.\n\nEither way it sounds like your aunt needs someone who is professionally equipped to deal with your cousin.  And definitely not for $5 a day. \n\nNTA. Your physical well-being is worth more than that.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to look after him if you don't want to.   It sounds like its hard work and while not his fault is not fair on you to have to suffer.\n\n$5 a day is ridiculously low for looking after anyone.", "NTA.  That\u2019s some very cheap babysitting, and a decidedly difficult person to babysit.  Your aunt may be frustrated because it\u2019s difficult for her to find childcare, but she\u2019s wrong to take that out on you.", "How many hours did those $5 entail?   Are you aware that babysitters can get $10-15 AN HOUR?   You were terribly underpaid, unless the gig was half an hour.\n\nCharge more, or back out.  You're going to need money for doctor and hospital bills.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \u201cIf it\u2019s selfish to not want to come home bruised up, I\u2019m happily selfish! I\u2019m sorry you enjoy being bruised up!\u201d", "NTA - it would cost them a hell of a lot more for childcare. Also people need to be experienced to look after children who have Austism. \n\nYou\u2019re still a kid yourself, it\u2019s not your responsibilty and they are using you for $5 for a day. Go enjoy yourself kid, you\u2019re too young to have responsibilities like this.", "$5 a day is just an insult. \n\nNTA- your physical wellbeing and *still being a kid* should be your priority. Your aunt needs to consider professional help for your cousin.", "NTA.  It must be hard for your aunt to find care for your cousin but jeepers, $5 per day is brutal.  Although your cousin can't help it, you being hurt isn't a good outcome of this arrangement either.  If that's called \"selfish\", well fine, let her call you that, it doesn't make it true.  You're young yourself and don't need something like this put on you.", "NTA. I work with developmentally disabled children, I love my job but it's definitely not for everyone. You're still a kid, and you don't have the training and experience to keep yourself and your cousin safe. \n\nIt's totally understandable to not want to get hurt babysitting. If you're overwhelmed your cousin could also get hurt, so it'd be irresponsible and selfish to keep babysitting when you're not equipped to handle him. 5 bucks a day is very cheap as well, you were doing her a massive favor she isn't entitled to. \n\nIt can be hard to find babysitters for disabled children, but that's your aunts issue to handle. If she's paying them like this and not giving them any information on how she handles his behavior, she definitely won't find anyone.", "NTA- Selfish is paying you only $5 . She\u2019s upset because you aren\u2019t letting her take advantage of you", "Professional fighters get bruised at work - not babysitters. You aunt took advantage of you by not telling you all the relevant details.\nNTA for bailing.", "NTA. Your aunt is. For a few reasons. \n\n1. Underpaying you\n\n2. Guilt tripping and name calling a minor (you) \n\n3. Not providing adequate care (not your fault btw) for her child who has demanding needs", "NTA. Nobody should need to be bruised by their work. I don't think you are selfish at all. Looking after a special needs child can be quite difficult. It may take someone who is specially educated to do this work. Such people usually don't come for 5$ a pop, though, so your aunt is either going to have to cough up a proper salary or do the work herself.", "NTA. $5 a day to take care of an autistic kid is nowhere even close to enough. I would\u2019ve negotiated at least $15/hr.", "NTA. Your aunt is cruel. She is exploiting you for cheap labour. You are not a slave.", "NTA child needs a properly trained carer.", "The going rate for babysitting, even a non-autistic child is between $5-$15 AN HOUR!!! Your aunt is delusional, and you're NTA.", "NTA\n\nBabysitting is not actually a combat sport by definition. I'm sure your Aunt is upset she won't be handing off her whirling boxer on the cheap, but you are perfectly within your rights to make the call and stick to it.", "You tried and it didn't work out. You're not the asshole.", "You are 17 and he is too much for you.\n\nYour aunt is pissed because no one would do this for 5 bucks an hour, let alone a day. \n\nNTA", "So they offer you 5 bucks a DAY and then CALL YOU SELFISH?

After gas money spent driving there and back, you probably lost money just by commuting.", "NTA - You really need to have specialized training to do this. They teach you how to protect yourself and restrain (if needed) the other individual while minimizing risk of injury.\n\nYour aunt ITA.

My babysitters make that in the first 20 minutes; my 4 year old is also fairly well behaved for his age. You would be NTA just for the offered pay alone!

If she wanted to go out on a Friday or Saturday night she had to pay for the babysitter.  She used to pay me $5 to go to her house to watch Kung Fu and some other TV shows with her brother so she could go on a date with her boyfriend.

That\u2019s underpaying for ANY kid regardless of disability and that\u2019s the real issue here. $10 an hour minimum, and that\u2019s with a steep family discount. I would also recommend learning a bit more about autism as you grow up so that you and your cousin can have a great relationship.

My point was he is getting fleeced even if he did feel competent.", "I was asked to watch over my little brother a lot, didn\u2019t get paid. I thought yeah no worries I love that little guy. And at some point we had a nanny since we don\u2019t have that much age difference and I was too small to be responsible for him for a whole afternoon, but it was fun. \n\nThe important difference or detail is: they never expected me too. They would ask if I want to. My parents didn\u2019t just assume that I would do it. If I didn\u2019t want to then they asked our neighbours/ some friends to look after both of us. So that was totally fine.", "My kids have a 9 year age difference so we feel it's fine that she looks after him for an hour when one of us is still in the house, just in a different room.\n\nAnd yes, we always ask. We don't want to make it something that makes her resent him."]}
