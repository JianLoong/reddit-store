Like, American dollars? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA. What a moocher.", "Totally unacceptable. I get paid $30/hour to watch and support children and adults who are autistic and nonverbal. Asking a teenager without training is insane to me. 100% NTA", "NTA. She is angry because her son is out of control and she's running out of options for him. I babysat an autistic girl for about a year and had to stop because it was too taxing.", "NTA. Doesn't matter if your aunt is happy or not; you have every right to refuse. Also, she was totally ripping you off.", "NTA your aunt wants to exploit you, you are not selfish or TA", "Five bucks a day??? You should be charging at least 10 or 15 an hour, for a non autistic child. Research babysitter rates in your area before you babysit any more. And absolutely DO NOT babysit a child if you feel in any way uncomfortable.\n\nIf your aunt needs respite, she should be looking up organizations that specialize in respite care for high needs kids.\n\nI am a parent of a now adult non verbal autistic son, and I would NEVER have left him with a 17 year old for an entire day when he was younger and more wild. Unfair to both you and your cousin, and also dangerous.\n\nNTA. Not even a little bit.", "NTA. You're not supposed to be getting 5 dollars. You should have been getting 15 or more a day. Your aunt is the AH for calling you selfish and not paying more.", "People are allowed to quit jobs, even babysitting jobs. It's dangerous and woefully underpaid, so you have no reason to keep watching your cousin. I'm sorry your aunt is dealing with this situation. Still, you are not obligated to keep going back. You tried. That's all anyone can ask. Glad your mom is on your side. Your aunt can have her tantrum. If anyone else in the family starts going after you, tell them they are so much more generous than you. You will let your aunt know they are stepping up to help.", "5 buck a DAY? \n\nFor a high support needs autistic? \n\nwhen you are 17? \n\nNTA", "NTA, not your job \u2026 but everyone should ease up on the aunt. Sounds like the uncle disappeared and there is zero government support in many jurisdictions.", "NTA.  Your aunt was taking advantage of you.  Even if she wasn\u2019t, you went through with it for a while and found that you could no longer handle it. There is nothing wrong with not being able to handle a situation like that.", "NTA the only selfish person is your aunt, who is not paying you fairly and accusing you of selfishness when you have si.ply made the only reasonable decision.", "NTA. I'm a nurse. I have specialized psychiatric and behavioral training that costs many thousands of dollars and many  thousands of hours of experience, and that's just for geriatric (old people) psych. It takes just as much, if not more, to deal with strong young kids with psychological and neurological disorders. Your aunt knows what she's asking would cost her about $40/hr for a specialized home health nurse to babysit. You are getting scammed, kid. That's why your mom is okay with you not doing it. That's too much crap for too little money, even for a 'regular' child. She's using you bc \"family\".... which is a cop-out.", "More like 15 bucks an hour minimum. That's straight up slavery. Especially when she would be paying 3 thousand a month for a trained daycare or service provider. As far as I'm concerned I would say this, \"your gunna pay me 30 dollars an hour, or you can try your luck with a daycare that's going to rob you blind\". Or no one at all because I'm not doing it without much more money.", "NTA\n\nFor 5$? No. Your aunt is selfish. That's slave wages to deal with a kid that's prone to harmful behavior. Screw that.", "NTA. you were underpaid to watch an abusive person.  You tried and then noped out of there. I would imagine your aunt cannot find anyone to watch him for the money she wants to spend.", "NTA. You are a child and can't be forced to keep an eye on any child, family or not. And $5 is so low.", "NTA Maybe this in a country where $5 is the equivalent of a middle class persons daily wage in their currency other wise can\u2019t even imagine that being appropriate", "Yeah. And it's the money... but also this child requires specialised supervision and support, not just another kid to be there while the parents are away.", "Also your mental well being as I'm sure this situation isn't doing your mental health any good either", "America", "Where I live that\u2019s about half minimum wage for 15 year olds", "Agreed", "That would be a bad hourly rate, let alone daily.", "The federal minimum wage in the US is $7.25 an hour. Your state may have a higher minimum wage. Here in Florida, it's $12.00 an hour.", "A Coke AND a Snickers for $5? In this economy? Dreaming lol", "Hahahahaha you are correct, I didn't say MINI sizes!", "My brother is only 2 years older than me. Once he got old enough to babysit, my parents were paying both of us to babysit each other \ud83d\ude05 Although he was older, I was the more responsible kid.", "NTA. Your Aunt was hoping to get CHEAP help, and you tried. To say that you cannot handle your cousin's violent behavior is a valid reason to opt out.   \n\n\nYour Aunt is in a difficult position, caring for your cousin, but it is not your job to rescue her.", "NTA. This was more of a challenge than anticipated,and the pay isn't worth it. You have the right to say \"no\" to any job that makes you uncomfortable.", "Extremely NTA. My mom is a Spec ED teacher who deals with children like that and worse. You have to have special training in order to actually interact with children like that. To have a 17 year old with what I can only assume minimal training if any is very irresponsible. To pay you $5 a day is quite literally insult to actual injury.", "NTA. Your aunt insulted you by paying you only $5 and has the entitlement to ask you to babysit more?! She can take care of her own child.", "NTA. First $5 a day is not enough for children without disabilities. Your cousin has severe autism. He needs an adult care giver who is trained in or is experienced with autism.", "Your cheap a** Aunt is the selfish one. You are NTA", "NTA\n\n$5 is not nearly enough for this kind of assignment!\n\nAnd your bruises...your cousin needs a stronger, more experienced minder than you.", "NTA.  Five bucks a day is a joke.  Not worth it even if he\u2019s well behaved.", "Absolutely NTA. This is a child with special needs that clearly needs specialized care, and you're a minor who shouldn't be expected to deal with that. Also for your aunt to call you selfish when she only wants to give you 5 bucks - in this economy?! Don't worry OP you're being perfectly fair!", "Nta, your aunt suckered you into doing for five bucks what would normally cost her a heckava lot more if she paid someone who was actually qualified to watch her kid. Now she's mad that you've wisely decided it wasn't worth it. This is on her not you and glad your mom is taking your side in this.", "NTA", "NTA - putting yourself in danger?...that's a no.  Getting a whole $5 for a day of being abused and battered? .... also a no.\n\nThe child needs an adult who's trained to deal with his autism as a caretaker, not another kid.", "NTA. Only $5 a day to babysit your cousin is a rip off, and your aunt knows it. She should be ashamed.", "It sounds as if your cousin and aunt would benefit from having access to trained direct service workers. Not sure if that is possible but a 17 year old with no training in how to properly care for a child with these behaviors and needs is dangerous for the caregiver and the child.  NTA", "NTA. A child like that needs trained supervision.  Neighbors with a very badly brain-damaged child (not the same, I know, but is I,are behavior) managed to open the tv remote and swallow he batteries. Kid had to be hospitalized u til they passed and checked that the batteries hadnt corroded in his system.  Thousands of dollars in medical costs, all because they tried to skimp on child care.", "NTA. At all.", "Autistic myself and NTA", "$5? You're being taken advantage of. NTA; this child needs a trained caretaker.", "5 bucks a day?! You\u2019re getting roughed up?!\n\nNTA", "Your aunt treated you like a slave. NTA.", "$5...a day?\n\nI don't care how old you are, that's called being grossly underpaid for a VERY demanding job. \n\nNTA.", "NTA...$5? That's ridiculous!", "Your aunt is ridiculous.  Unless you\u2019re working for 15 minutes at a time, $5 a day is insane.  And no one would work in conditions like that for that amount.  She can pound sand and find a professional to care for her child, instead of another child. NTA", "AMEN. no", "20 an hour for children without issues in my area", "I think OP just wanted to help out family and the $5 was a token payment. I did the same thing for some relatives where they \u201cpaid\u201d me to translate some legal documents. What they paid wouldn\u2019t have gotten 10% of their work translated, but I just wanted to help them out.", "Exactly. She needs professional at-home care if she wants someone to watch him for any reason. Level 3 autism (I'm assuming) isn't a \"just hire anyone and they'll be fine\" condition.", "Mid 80s I received somewhere between 10 & 20$ for about 2 to 3 hours twice a week.\n\nFive for a full day with a special needs kid is not even close to what the Aunt sgould be offering. \n\nOp, nta."]}
