I'd be curious, too.", "Most of my adult life people have called me Jill, it's not my name not even close to my name, it's weird.  Odd that the person was upset. People are odd sometimes in their reactions.", "NTA.  I would have a little response set if they say the wrong name, either ignore it and say \"This is Ashley.

I wonder if there was a person who was there forever before you who was named Kim/Kate?", " no, NTA.
