That's weird behavior, especially after you *just* told her your name. I'm curious why she got so defensive about you correcting her.", "NTA. I'd be curious, too.", "Most of my adult life people have called me Jill, it's not my name not even close to my name, it's weird.  Odd that the person was upset. People are odd sometimes in their reactions.", "NTA.  I would have a little response set if they say the wrong name, either ignore it and say \"This is Ashley.  And, yes, I'll send that right up!\"  Is there someone there with that name?", "NTA- people need to pay attention. Names are important.", "People used to call me Rebecca all the time\u2026 my name has the same number of letters, but is definitely not Rebecca. \n\nPeople are weird.", "NTA. I wonder if there was a person who was there forever before you who was named Kim/Kate?", " no, NTA. It happens frequently and i think its totally natural after a while to wonder why two names that sound nothing alike continue to be confused. You werent rude so i think you\u2019re fine", "NTA - Just a strange repetitive mistake by seemingly a number of different callers? Bit of an AH move to hang up you, did they at least apologise first?", "Nta. You're just trying to figure out what's going on. I have no idea why people react like that to questions but so many do. It's just bizarre.", "NTA\n\nI would have said No one is the Ahole if they hadnt argued with you. Had they replied 'Oh gosh! Im sorry!! For some reason I thought you said Kim. I will make sure and call you Ashley from now on! \n\nThen it would have been No one is the Ahole. But nope, they had to get all defensive and double down.

The only wrinkle here in case you are not telling us is if you have a non-standard non-English name.

Definitely set the record straight, but don't get bogged down with it unless you discover some nefarious plot", "I wish I knew. Then maybe I could convince them to stop calling me Nancy or Carol, neither of which is even close to my name!", "NTA. Clearly they don't care who you are there, they're extraordinarily unobservant, and they're completely disrespectful. Keep reiterating what your actual name is, and do it as nicely as possible. If you want to be petty, send it right back at them. \"Oh, I thought you said your name was Bob!\" Then say, \"Now you know how I feel when you keep calling me by the wrong name.\"", "INFO: Does anyone at the lab have the name Kim?", "Try this. Every time they call and ask for Kim. Say she\u2019s not here and hang up. Or Kim is busy taking a shit, call back later. Just keep putting them off.

Can you explain how exactly I was rude?
