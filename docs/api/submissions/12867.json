She keeps saying she has postpartum depression. She doesn't. She\u2019s projecting her worries of being a bad mother onto me. She doesn\u2019t let me watch my grandson alone, not even if she just needs to go to the bathroom. Jennifer will take the baby with her, she also refuses to sleep train and holds the baby far too much and I worry that he will never learn to fall asleep properly and be too reliant on her. She always goes on about this new parenting fad she\u2019s doing and will be short with me telling me she doesn\u2019t want my help because I did such an \u201cExcellent\u201d job with my son.\n\nThe therapist has begun taking my side, causing Jennifer to start demanding that we end therapy.

This is not an AITA question because there's three sides to every story: your side, her side and the truth. It's hard to gauge what the truth or accuracy there is to the story.   But based on your entire post, it feels very vindictive, higher than thou and very toxic.\n\n\n\\- If someone wants to go to therapy with you, their goal is to try to mend/heal/better the relationship. I commend your DIL for this. \n\n\\- You claim that her postpartum depression is fake but you don't know if that's the case, so that's super judgmental on your part (I can sense that's probably one of the reasons why she wanted to go to therapy). Your judgment of he rparenting and telling her and almost seemingly nagging her is probably also pushing her away and causing her to take issue with you. The thing about parenting is you can be disappointed in how someone is doing it but unless it's YOUR baby (not grandbaby, YOUR baby), it's not your place unless she asks for advice. \n\n\\- You claim that because the therapist is \"taking your side\", that's why she's ending it. Another judgment. You also dont' know if the therapist is taking a side - that's just your opinion. Therapists don't take sides unless the relationship is so bad that they actually tell both of you to your face in session that it's unhealthy to continue. When my partner and I started therapy, our therapist was clear that if it was actually a harmful relationship (not just toxic), she would tell us and would suggest ending therapy for safety reasons. A therapist is also neutral or should be unless harm is being done. So I don't put much weight into you saying that the therapist is \"taking your side\" which is why your DIL doesn't want to go. \n\n\\- What i find troubling is also the idea you think she's trying to isolate your son. Your son sided with her on ending therapy. Sounds like your son supports your DIL and it frustrates you. Your son is a grown ass man with a child of his own and if he wants to find a church that suits him better, that's on him. If you have an issue with it, talk to your son. Blaming her is only going to cause friction between you and your son. The more you push, the more he'll likely continue to ice you out for the safety of his family (which is him, Jennifer and their child). \n\n\\- you can't force someone to continue therapy. there are no AHs here on that front. Two people have to both want to be there for it to work.   \n\n\nAs someone who has a strained relationship with my MIL, I can understand why Jennifer might have ended therapy. I have a hunch based on your side of the story that she can't handle the lack of accountability and the victimhood narrative. There comes a point when some people realize that the type of relationship she wants with you (in a positive way) isn't achievable so maybe she's throwing in the towel and will be courteous but she can't continue to be emotionally vulnerable with you because it's not being received in any way. That's her boundary and is about her wellbeing, not about you and trying to slight you.   \n\n\nI honestly hope you can read all this and reflect more on your part in this narrative and what you could do better. How can you make the relationship better WITHOUT therapy (since she doesn't want to go). How can you stop putting your son in the middle of this and causing more friction. How can you love without smothering or inserting yourself? How can you support your DIL and son's relationship?", "NAH - there is no conflict here. You want to continue therapy, you can continue going but you cant force your daughter in law to go with you if that is your dilemma.\n\n\nBut criticizing the way a new mother chose to raise her children is an AH move.
