There\u2019s no such thing as holding your kid to much t\u2019s a personal preference and it\u2019s her kid so your preference doesn\u2019t matter.  YTA", "NAH. This is not an AITA question because there's three sides to every story: your side, her side and the truth. It's hard to gauge what the truth or accuracy there is to the story.   \n\n\n\\- If someone wants to go to therapy with you, their goal is to try to mend/heal/better the relationship. I commend your DIL for this. \n\n\\- You claim that her postpartum depression is fake but you don't know if that's the case, so that's super judgmental on your part (I can sense that's probably one of the reasons why she wanted to go to therapy). Your judgment of he rparenting and telling her and almost seemingly nagging her is probably also pushing her away and causing her to take issue with you. The thing about parenting is you can be disappointed in how someone is doing it but unless it's YOUR baby (not grandbaby, YOUR baby), it's not your place unless she asks for advice. \n\n\\- You claim that because the therapist is \"taking your side\", that's why she's ending it. Another judgment. You also dont' know if the therapist is taking a side - that's just your opinion. Therapists don't take sides unless the relationship is so bad that they actually tell both of you to your face in session that it's unhealthy to continue. When my partner and I started therapy, our therapist was clear that if it was actually a harmful relationship (not just toxic), she would tell us and would suggest ending therapy for safety reasons. A therapist is also neutral or should be unless harm is being done. So I don't put much weight into you saying that the therapist is \"taking your side\" which is why your DIL doesn't want to go. \n\n\\- What i find troubling is also the idea you think she's trying to isolate your son. Your son sided with her on ending therapy. Sounds like your son supports your DIL and it frustrates you. Your son is a grown ass man with a child of his own and if he wants to find a church that suits him better, that's on him. If you have an issue with it, talk to your son. Blaming her is only going to cause friction between you and your son. The more you push, the more he'll likely continue to ice you out for the safety of his family (which is him, Jennifer and their child). \n\n\\- you can't force someone to continue therapy. there are no AHs here on that front. Two people have to both want to be there for it to work.   \n\n\nAs someone who has a strained relationship with my MIL, I can understand why Jennifer might have ended therapy. I have a hunch based on your side of the story that she can't handle the lack of accountability and the victimhood narrative. There comes a point when some people realize that the type of relationship she wants with you (in a positive way) isn't achievable so maybe she's throwing in the towel and will be courteous but she can't continue to be emotionally vulnerable with you because it's not being received in any way. That's her boundary and is about her wellbeing, not about you and trying to slight you.   \n\n\nI honestly hope you can read all this and reflect more on your part in this narrative and what you could do better. How can you make the relationship better WITHOUT therapy (since she doesn't want to go). How can you stop putting your son in the middle of this and causing more friction. How can you love without smothering or inserting yourself? How can you support your DIL and son's relationship?", "NAH - there is no conflict here. You want to continue therapy, you can continue going but you cant force your daughter in law to go with you if that is your dilemma.\n\n\nBut criticizing the way a new mother chose to raise her children is an AH move.

I thought that at first too. It's probably some other cult.\n\nEdit: unless there are Scientologist counselors of some sort. That would explain the side-taking.", "It\u2019s more that OP says her DIL is \u201cmaking\u201d him do this. She\u2019s taking all agency away from her son and attributing HIS decisions to his wife. And usually when people don\u2019t recognize another person\u2019s independence in their thoughts/actions, it\u2019s because *they* were the ones influencing that person\u2019s thoughts/actions before the new person arrived.\n\nSo OP is likely upset because she perceives her son is doing what his wife says instead of doing what she says. As soon as she said the DIL is forcing this on the son, OP lost me.", "Yes, therapists should never pick sides. TBH I doubt they are and that is only OPs perception of what is happening. Jennifer probably wants to stop because she realizes it's pointless.", "It\u2019s so incredibly telling that the only comment you replied to is one \u201ctaking your side.\u201d You don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the asshole - you just want everyone to back you up so that you can hold it over your daughter-in-law\u2019s head.\n\nI hope your son goes no contact.", "ITS NOT YOUR BABY ITS HERS", "yta. for one its not your fucking baby. you don't get to ell her wat to do or how to behave with her child at all. not your right not your place. she doesn't want you around her kid alone. and she has the right to make that decision and the fact your son is on her side is telling. he made his own.communtiy.. I'm sure if I go back through your posts we will find the reason why dil can't stand you", "See here's the fun part... even if this *sole* comment commiserating with you was correct, and you weren't the AH (even though, yes YTA) it doesn't matter. Not at all.\n\nYour DIL doesn't *have* to go to therapy with you if she doesn't want to. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you *did* convince the therapist you were \"right\" (which I highly doubt).\n\nYour *son* agrees with your DIL.\n\nAnd you have no authority over him. Or her. Or *their* baby. They are the only ones who get to decide if you ever see *any* of them again.\n\nSo even if you were *right*, and you weren't an \"AH\" in *this* situation... You're *still* an AH for destroying any chance of repairing these relationships you *claim* to want to maintain.\n\nBut hey, after they go NC with you, and you're old and alone and bitter, you can look back and think of how that one therapist, and one commenter on AITA thought you might have a point.\n\nI'm sure that will be a great comfort to you.", "You *are* the muck. Once you learn to respect boundaries set by your son and Jennifer, things will move forward. You need to learn that you\u2019re not head of their house. You need to remember that this is not your baby and your parenting opinions don\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t have the right to hold anyone\u2019s child unless they are comfortable with that; being blood doesn\u2019t matter. Keep this up and they\u2019ll be selling their house to go as far from you as possible.", "Last I saw, she replied to one comment, one of the only ones supporting her.", "Yeah, nothing about this post suggests OP is a reliable narrator.\n\nThat said, my sister is a therapist and she says that family or couples therapy with a narcissist can be challenging because they can be very skilled at presenting a reasonable and well-adjusted front that can fool therapists and make the other person feel like therapy is pointless. I am not saying that OP is a narcissist but she definitely isn't a definite non-narcissist.", "It\u2019s the only one that makes sense", ">definitely isn't a definite non-narcissist\n\nThis."]}
