He lives in a different state and was supposed to attend an event in our city for work. So he asked if he could stay and we said why not. We also hadn't seen each other since Christmas so it was a two birds with one stone situation.\n\nI (33F) have a son (Theo 5M) with my wonderful wife (Ava - 35F). Theo adores James and they always get along pretty well. Also, Theo is much more active when James is around, and they do all sorts of fun activities together. I also am the same kind of an aunt to his kids. Overall, we have a great relationship. Also, James is the prankster in the family and everyone adores him.\n\nBefore I forget, I need to say that when Ava concentrates on something, she has a pretty bad reaction to all kinds of sudden stimuli. She gets startled really easily by things that don't usually startle people. For example if I cough loudly while she's focused on her work, she'd get startled. If I just say hi really loudly, she'd get startled. She goes into full panic attack if this sudden stimulation becomes severe enough and I've learned to work around that through the 13 years that we've been together. Also, everyone in the family knows about it and are usually very sensitive and understanding.\n\nWhile James was with us, I suddenly heard a loud scream followed by a thud. James had convinced Theo to prank Ava (Theo knows normally that his mama is a bit more sensitive than I, and I do remind him of that). The prank was to put on loud heavy metal music as Theo jumped to give his mom a hug. As you can guess, Ava had a panic attack. It took a while before she was even able to calm down. Theo was also pretty scared after seeing her like that. My heart broke into a thousand pieces.\n\nI was beyond pissed at James. I called him an insensitive prick and told him not to ever do something like this again. He was genuinely sorry and apologised. I told him to find somewhere else to stay for the night because I couldn't look at him at the moment. \n\nI took Ava to the doctor and thankfully she is now okay. As I'm digesting everything, and based on messages I got from my SIL and parents, I think I may have overreacted. I would like an objective opinion on this.", "created_utc": 1685196758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t8k6x/aita_for_telling_my_brother_off_after_he_pulled_a/", "score": 982, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are abusing your son by leaving him with a parent who has a panic attack if someone says, \"Hi!\" too loudly, or screams uncontrollably if someone puts loud music on. How does she cope when she leaves the house? Because I'd like to see her cope with so much as a car horn going off. If she has a panic attack on the street, who is going to look after your kid?
