{"id": 18293, "submission_id": "13t8k6x", "title": "AITA for telling my brother off after he pulled a prank on my wife?", "selftext": "My brother (James - 36M) came to stay with my family for a few days. He lives in a different state and was supposed to attend an event in our city for work. So he asked if he could stay and we said why not. We also hadn't seen each other since Christmas so it was a two birds with one stone situation.\n\nI (33F) have a son (Theo 5M) with my wonderful wife (Ava - 35F). Theo adores James and they always get along pretty well. Also, Theo is much more active when James is around, and they do all sorts of fun activities together. I also am the same kind of an aunt to his kids. Overall, we have a great relationship. Also, James is the prankster in the family and everyone adores him.\n\nBefore I forget, I need to say that when Ava concentrates on something, she has a pretty bad reaction to all kinds of sudden stimuli. She gets startled really easily by things that don't usually startle people. For example if I cough loudly while she's focused on her work, she'd get startled. If I just say hi really loudly, she'd get startled. She goes into full panic attack if this sudden stimulation becomes severe enough and I've learned to work around that through the 13 years that we've been together. Also, everyone in the family knows about it and are usually very sensitive and understanding.\n\nWhile James was with us, I suddenly heard a loud scream followed by a thud. James had convinced Theo to prank Ava (Theo knows normally that his mama is a bit more sensitive than I, and I do remind him of that). The prank was to put on loud heavy metal music as Theo jumped to give his mom a hug. As you can guess, Ava had a panic attack. It took a while before she was even able to calm down. Theo was also pretty scared after seeing her like that. My heart broke into a thousand pieces.\n\nI was beyond pissed at James. I called him an insensitive prick and told him not to ever do something like this again. He was genuinely sorry and apologised. I told him to find somewhere else to stay for the night because I couldn't look at him at the moment. \n\nI took Ava to the doctor and thankfully she is now okay. As I'm digesting everything, and based on messages I got from my SIL and parents, I think I may have overreacted. I would like an objective opinion on this.", "created_utc": 1685196758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t8k6x/aita_for_telling_my_brother_off_after_he_pulled_a/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have told your family about her issue and he thinks it\u2019s funny to scare her into a panic attack and have your child watch?  NTA. I\u2019d be livid.", "NTA. Pranks are hit and miss at the best of times, but especially when a prank is aimed at a person's sensitivities/anxieties/etc. In that case, it's not even a prank anymore; it's just bullying.", "NTA. Your brother presumably knows this about her and for whatever reason thought it would be funny. That's not cool and he should know better. I don't blame you for being pissed and asking him to leave. In my opinion, that's a very reasonable reaction. He needs to seriously apologize.", "NTA\nAnd I'm speechless. I startle easily too, in fact I'm jumpier than any cat, and if my BIL would talk my very own kid into startling me as \"a prank\", I honestly don't know if I would find it in my heart to forgive him. Probably not. \nKudos to you OP for standing up for your wife!", "NTA. Quite honestly, a lot of men need to understand randomly jumping out to attack women can be extremely traumatizing or bring back memories of traumatic events. Jumping out and giving a woman a \"hug\" is basically nothing short of what would begin a potential case of SA. Not cool.", "NTA.  HOWEVER...\n\n\"The prank was to put on loud heavy metal music as Theo jumped to give his mom a hug.\"\n\nI guess I don't understand.  How was this supposed to be a prank?", "NTA. My objective opinion is that your brother is a malicious jerk.", "NTA. What your brother did wasn't a prank. It was bullying. Especially if he knows that your wife startles easily. Even worse, he involved your son in his malicious behavior. \n\nA prank is only funny if everybody is laughing. Neither your wife nor your son was laughing.", "NTA, majorly startling someone and itprovoke a panic attack, and involving their child is a major, major dick move.  Demanding space from your brother is a pretty reasonable response.", "NTA. Your brother is the TA and not just for the prank, but for also getting your son involved. A prank is only funny when everyone involves finds it funny. This was only funny to one side-the pranker. Your brother knew what her reaction would be (I'm wagering) and should have not pulled that prank. Your brother, as a prankster, should have known that sort of thing isn't okay.", "NTA.\n\nDoes anyone know wtf a prank is anymore?", "**NTA**   The prank was not funny and doubly offensive as he has your son do this to his own mother. \n\nSIL has no business commenting.", "NTA - Jumpscare pranks are always a fun way to learn that someone has a very real condition.\n\nDoesn't take long to realize those \"pranks\" are usually just thinly-veiled bullying and emotional manipulation.\n\nYou didn't overreact.", "In that case, it's not even a prank anymore; it's just bullying.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother knows of your wife\u2019s sensitivity and yet he still decided to prank her.", "Nta but your wife needs therapy.   Her behavior is not normal.", "Guy court convened.  \n\nThe actions perpetrated by your brother constitute a dick move.  It is our unanimous opinion that your brother's development has been stunted.  He is acting more the teenager and less the man.  \n\nWe recommend an immediate review of his man card due to the disregard for your wife's unique circumstances and the recruitment of the minor child.  \n\nSeveral on the court were strongly in favor of immediate expulsion due to the egregiousness of said recruitment of the minor child.  This is a particularly significant offense as it falls very obviously in the section on \" how not to be a role model.\"  Your brother willfully disregarded hIs role as an uncle and potentially propagated future bad behavior by the minor child.", "I think kicking your brother out was an extreme reaction. But, there was no way you could anticipate he'd do something so reckless and potentially harmful to your family.\n\nSo, since you overreacted to his pranking your wife, tell him that you want to be able to trust him to NEVER have a go at your wife like that again.\n\n\"And don't teach my child its OK to break house rules because its funny. Obviously him becoming afraid isn't funny at all. Knock it off dude. I want to enjoy you, but, I'm not a lion tamer at the circus. No one needs chaos.\"\n\nAnd invite him to dinner and put the matter behind you. NTA - just siblings who need to  act like grownups.", "NTA but... It's good you set your boundaries but I feel like you went a little far.", "YTA\n\nDon't take your wife to the GP, take her to the fucking psychologist. I grew up with a mentally ill father. I'm forty now, he finally started accepting treatment a ways back and we have a great relationship... but I'm still left with a number of strong 'automatic' responses to aggressive male behaviour and those responses are going to get me killed at some point because I can't vary them to fit the situation/individual in question that's losing his shit. You are abusing your son by leaving him with a parent who has a panic attack if someone says, \"Hi!\" too loudly, or screams uncontrollably if someone puts loud music on. How does she cope when she leaves the house? Because I'd like to see her cope with so much as a car horn going off. If she has a panic attack on the street, who is going to look after your kid? Because if she can't take care of herself then she sure as fuck can't take care of a five year old.\n\nStop coddling your wife and ***stop making your son believe that he's responsible for her mental health***. He's five. She's an adult. Who throws a lengthy screaming fit if someone turns the music up. Jesus. If something happens to you, who's looking after the kid? Because it won't be your wife. She'll be screaming and cowering in the corner because someone said, \"Hi!\"\n\nFor the record, I made the decision not to have children because of shit like this. I couldn't bear the thought of doing to my own child what my father did to me. Your son is either going to end up with a severe anxiety disorder, or he's going to spend his entire childhood and adolescence convinced that he has to look after his mother.\n\nThe pair of you get your shit together!", "NTA for telling him off, but don't ruin your relationship over that. Telling him to find a place to stay was already a bit too much.\n\nAnd your wife needs therapy. Like yesterday.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
