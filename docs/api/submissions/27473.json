With this job, I get a company vehicle. Before I accepted the offer, I was talking to my GF about the company car and I mentioned instead of selling my vehicle, I\u2019d let her use it in the winter.\n\nHer car is pretty bad in snow, even with snow tires on the car. Also, she\u2019s been having issues with it starting to stall while she\u2019s driving, especially when it gets really cold. \n\nHer car is paid off and between bills we split and her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a new car, so I figured this would save her the headache and we could talk about a newer car for her next year.\n\nAfter I accepted my offer, I looked to see what my car was worth and it\u2019s a lot more than I was thinking. I personally could really use that money, so I decided I would sell my car now while it\u2019s still worth that amount. \n\nI told my girlfriend when she got home from work and she lost her mind. She asked what she\u2019s supposed to do in the winter now, so I told her what the car is worth and asked if she\u2019d want to buy it from me, and that just pissed her off even more.\n\nI personally think she\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s my car. I even offered to let her buy it from me, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. But, I need to know, AITA?\n\nEdit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is. I\u2019m still selling the car. My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.", "created_utc": 1695483977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q7sel/aita_for_selling_my_car_instead_of_letting_my_gf/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You certainly are entitled to sell your car as it is your property - but is it possible you can wait to sell it in the spring? Or are you willing to drive your girlfriend as needed? Can she Uber? Does she have any back up options?", "YTA. You originally told your girlfriend she could use it. Now, knowing you will be much better off financially but she will still be unable to buy a car, you\u2019ve changed your mind. You aren\u2019t treating her like someone whose safety you care about.

My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\n\nWhy bother asking if youre the AH if all you're going to do is argue and show everyone how little you think of your GF.\n\nIf this is true, I hope she leaves you, you obviously don't care about her at all", "YTA. The time to do your research and figure out if you were going to sell it or let her use it was BEFORE you made the offer.

I remember feeling really taken care of by a partner for the first time.", "YTA - is this a serious relationship? You told her you were going to do X for her and did something different without talking to her first. Are you going to help her with a car this winter or just leave her to fend for herself? If you leave her out in the cold, literally in this case, do not be surprised when she leaves you entirely.", "YTA. Just saying, I would have packed my shit and left.", "Lol even after a verdict \"it is what it is. She can suck it up\" \n\nYou have a bright future of AITA posts ahead of you", "YTA you made a really thoughtful offer to help her out when she needed it, you mentioned a car payment would be hard for her\n\nThen you got greedy and decided money is more important than helping your girlfriend during a few months when she needs it (and she\u2019d be safer)", "YTA -  You went back on your prior commitment and then have the gall to call your GF selfish.  Offering her the car at market price is not doing her a favor", "YTA. You went back on your word. You are giving her reason to mistrust you.", "YTA It's too premature to sell your car. Don't cut off your nose to spite your face. You haven't completed your probationary period with your new job You could get fired. The company could change it's policy about the use of company cars. A whole host of things could happen and you'll be scrambling to get a car.", "YTA. Several times over.\n\nSo, let's recap.\n\n* YOU got a great job offer with a company car.\n* GF's car is old, and UNSAFE in the winter, at least.\n* You, generously, said \"Hey, honey, I got this new job and a new car - you can use my old car.\" Everyone wins.\n* You then, inexplicably, investigated the value of your old car, and found out it was worth more than you thought. So, you decided to GO BACK ON YOUR PROMISE TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET.\n* Not content with just being that much of an asshole, you then said, knowing VERY well she couldn't afford it \"well you can just buy it from me if you want.\" (Let's say in your head, when you made the original offer, you thought the car was worth $10K. So, you were offering GF a loan of an item worth $10K. You later found out it was actually worth $15K, and got dollar signs in your eyes. Then you go to your GF and say \"Well, I offered you a $10K gift, but you're not worth $15K to me, so pay me $15K or I'm selling the car and keeping it all for myself.\")\n* You come on here for a judgment and get told, rightly, that you are a giant, gaping asshole.\n* You triple down on your assholery and say \"GF will suck it up\".\n\nI sure the fuck hope that GF kicks your toxic ass to the curb ASAP. Enjoy your lonely life.", "When she dumps you, can you use the company car to move? \n\n\n\"My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA\nBeen a while since I've seen such a clear case as well.\n\nYou offer the car, state she can't afford a new one, her car has problems, and then retract the offer. Just about as black and white as it gets.\n\nAs for the edit that she'll get over it \"like all the other fights\" ... I hope she doesn't.", "Wow your edit there at the end is spectacular. She will just get over it like all the other times? Really??!! YTA in SO many ways. If I was her id get out now. Someone who cant keep their word is massive red flag. It makes one wonder what happens when you make other bigger promises? Dont worry they are all rhetorical questions", "She doesn\u2019t need a new car\u2026 she needs a new boyfriend!", "YTA.  First for going back on your word where she could use the car and then demanding a full current selling price.  Perhaps you could come to an agreement where she sells her car, you take that money as a down payment, then she gets a loan in the spring or use the money she was going go save up and pays you back the rest then.  Not the best overall arrangement, but if you're so unwilling to accept the market risk come spring, it is an alternative to your all or nothing.", "YTA for not waiting til the spring. Yes the car may go down in value, but what value is your girlfriend\u2019s safety? This gives her time to save up for a car and be safe. Why is everyone so transactional nowadays?!", "She\u2019ll be \u201cex\u201d soon enough", "Omg not only YTA you\u2019re making a dumbass move. You\u2019re her live in boyfriend. Who do you think she is going to call when he car stalls and doesn\u2019t restart? Who will she call when she slides off the road and needs help? Who will help her with the expenses of towing, repairs, possible medical bills if she slides off the road and gets hurt?? It\u2019s you!!! Even if you don\u2019t have to pay for those things you will probably have to cover her part of rent if that happens. You\u2019re also showing you have no regards for the life and safety of your girlfriend. Why not give her your car and sell her old car and keep the money from that?", "Each fight she has to get over, is a strike. How many strikes do you think your relationship can take before you're out?\n\nIt sounds like you're dismissive and selfish since she's the one who has to get over it when you guys fight.", "Oh, he offered to sell it to her!  How thoughtful of you! How come she didn't think it on her own? She can't afford any car, but if she buys your expensive car solves everything. I lifted my eyebrows so high reading this sentence, that I began to look like Jeffrey Star\n\nNot only you backed down on your word, but you had to be an AH about it\n\nShe is also an AH if she stays in this relationship\n\nYTA. Major one", "Oh, my. That edit. Yeah, hope the GF comes to her senses.", "YTA, specifically because you changed it on her. You already promised her that she would have access to it. You would be wrong to go back on that.\n\nApologize and let her use the car.\n\nAlso, your heading is misleading.", "YTA! Not for wanting to sell the car while it\u2019s high-priced but for being an unreliable bf with no empathy. \nI understand that it probably was a positive surprise to see your car\u2018s value but why didn\u2019t you have a constructive conversation with your gf about what to do? \nCouldn\u2019t you have tried to find a solution together? Also, trying to sell your partner something at market value sounds disturbing!!", "Info: Why are you living with your GF. Just for convenience and to lower your bills? Or is it because you love her and want to build a life together because you possibly want them in you life forever?\n\nI ask because while I understand separate finances and even have most of mine separate from my wife\u2019s. I actually gave my better old car to them before we got married and never thought of selling it for my own financial gain because they were obviously a priority in my life and I expected the same from them if the roles were reversed.\n\nThe car is actually unsafe. It can leave her stranded and in danger of crashing in the upcoming winter. How much money was worth your GF risking that?", ">Edit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is. I\u2019m still selling the car. My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\n\nI hope she gets over it by getting over you. YTA x1000", "Well you should not have  told her she could use it before researching. YTA", "You're 10000000% the AH.\n\nIf I were her I'd walk out on your ass yesterday. Like, lol \"offered to let her buy it\" from you, knowing full well that she already only has enough money to make ends meet.", "YTA\n\nYou say you want to sell it now while the value is still high? That's not how car value works. Additionally, new car supplies are still low, and with the Auto Union strike in the US, that's not likely to change anytime soon. Meaning, used car value is going to remain high.\n\nYTA for a few reasons: you and gf discussed and came up with a plan together, then you alone decided to change it. Why not have a conversation about it again.\n\nThis is also really short sided in your part. Job stability is really low. You are planning to sell the only reliable vehicle before you've even started the job. What if you lose the job? What if the company decides it can't afford company cars anymore? What if your first day you realize there are restrictions on how much you can use the company car for personal reasons?\n\nAlso, the \"they won't fire me, they're short staffed\", have you not been paying attention? The jobs in the most short staffed sectors are the ones that do get cut the most frequently. Usually for \"not being a team player\", as in not doing the work of 6 people.\n\nYou are putting short term financial gain over long term stability. And your making decisions unilaterally that impact both of you", "YTA.\n\nYou told her that she could use it, and then you sold it without talking to her. You didn't even ask her if she wanted to buy it from you.", "> My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\n\nBuddy don't count on it. It's a big breach of trust to say you'll do something (especially something that will be a huge help to her) and then turn around and not only not do it but offer it only if she pays you, when you already know she can't afford it.", "I\u2019m curious how much is this car going to earn you? In the future you should tell all future girlfriends that is how much they are worth to you. YTA and all the doubling down doesn\u2019t make you look better.", "You are a colossal a******. You come here for advice, are pretty well  unanimously declared the a****** and then you post an update that proves you've learned nothing.

You do realise everything you described about her car makes it dangerous in the colder weather, right? And that edit, oh man. If she has any sense she\u2019s out the door.", "YTA. Baffled by people who ask when they clearly don't care if they're assholes. Anyway, regardless of whether you care, you're an asshole of epic proportions. Would have simply been an asshole except for your last sentence. You don't care about your GF on the slightest. Not her opinion, not her comfort or safety and not her opinion of you. One has to assume that you're simply using her. I hope she realizes that sooner rather than later.", "YTA\n\nYou already told her she could use it.", "\u201cMy gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\u201d You are a piece of trash and I hope she realizes she deserves better.

Yes. Is it an AH move to tell someone you're going to give them something that will increase their safety and solve a problem for them, give them time to get used to the idea, then say JUST KIDDING and pull it back? Also yes.\n\nAnd making it clear that money matters more to you than your gf's feelings might be honest but it's really not a good way to keep a relationship alive, if that's a goal of yours.", "YTA for telling your GF she could use you car and then selling it. You should really look at the fine print on your company car deal as you may not be allowed to use it except for work related travel, I.E. to and from work.", "YTA and after reading your responses too,  I hope she leaves you. Being a team, in a relationship is not something like this.", "YTA and your comments on this thread back that up.", "OP, please show this post and comments (including yours) to your gf and then report back.", "There really is no use trying to convince this guy that what he did is a dick move because he already made up his mind and was really hoping people would agree with him on what he did even though he knows that he is the AH in this case.

You created the situation you are in by offering before doing any research on your cars value. The fact that it\u2019s worth what it\u2019s worth now and may dip in value later is irrelevant.", "YTA, and I\u2019m not really sure how you don\u2019t see that.  Yes it is your car, but you already said that you would give it to your girlfriend.  And then you had the nerve to tell her that she could *buy* it off of you?  She\u2019s not selfish, you are.", "YTA, you offered her use of the car then pulled the rug out from under her.

With this job, I get a company vehicle. Before I accepted the offer, I was talking to my GF about the company car and I mentioned instead of selling my vehicle, I\u2019d let her use it in the winter.\n\nHer car is pretty bad in snow, even with snow tires on the car. Also, she\u2019s been having issues with it starting to stall while she\u2019s driving, especially when it gets really cold. \n\nHer car is paid off and between bills we split and her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a new car, so I figured this would save her the headache and we could talk about a newer car for her next year.\n\nAfter I accepted my offer, I looked to see what my car was worth and it\u2019s a lot more than I was thinking. I personally could really use that money, so I decided I would sell my car now while it\u2019s still worth that amount. \n\nI told my girlfriend when she got home from work and she lost her mind. She asked what she\u2019s supposed to do in the winter now, so I told her what the car is worth and asked if she\u2019d want to buy it from me, and that just pissed her off even more.\n\nI personally think she\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s my car. I even offered to let her buy it from me, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. But, I need to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So you\u2019re willing to let her continue to drive a vehicle that could be considered a safety hazard, rather than let her use yours? You also mentioned the bills and her student loans. It\u2019s possible that she can\u2019t afford to buy your vehicle. This is an opportunity for you to step up to help your girlfriend, but you\u2019re just thinking of yourself. Also, what was the point in even asking the question when you already had your mind made up as to what you were going to do?

It happens; not everyone matures at the same rate. I admit I think I am immature. You're still on \"me me me\" and \"not my problem\" phase. And she'll get over it like she always does; big assumption for a person you've been living with for a year.\n\nThe problem is you make a lot of assumptions about how much crap she'll take, her friends' reaction when they hear of this, and her family's reaction when they hear of this. It's one thing to get into a minor disagreement, but another to do this where she'll have all winter to think about this; and if the winter is really bad she will have a really long time to think. Being on the wrong side of her friends and family is not going to help your cause; she will be hearing how she could do better and if she values any of their opinions it's not going to help your relationship.\n\nHopefully you have other redeeming qualities beyond the standard cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry. Taking back a promise like that is harsh. Again, doing something like that and being unrepentent is a sign of lack of maturity, or you just don't care as it's just another relationship. Whatever you do - good luck.

If u promised it to her for her to use u could also add a caveat to the deal to explain hey even though I\u2019m willing to help u, there are other things that are currently on my mind that I may even want to sell the car. So keep that in mind something like that and let her know. She couldn\u2019t have been upset then because u broke down to her what she was getting into. \n\nYou could\u2019ve even did it like this, u randomly had your car value checked and got an answer of how much money you would get\u2026 u should\u2019ve had immediately discussed it with her what has changed in the situation and explain the why and try to persuade her to see her from your point of view. Hopefully u was using the money that u got from the car to figure out a contingency plan for her car situation because it ties back to u offering to help. \n\nAnyway u had and have so many different opportunities to communicate with her and unfortunately at this point due to you not sharing that info it has become a trust issue. Hope u guys can hash it out and figure out a solution", ">Edit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is. I\u2019m still selling the car. My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\n\nI was reading and I didn't think you were that much of an AH, it was a shitty thing to do sure, but not that bad.\n\nBut that edit there was so red flag that I have to go with YTA, she probably deserves better than this.\n\nCan't you guys get to a better arrangement?

I would not have my current car without his help.", "How about you stop having her pay for half your bills when you make nearly twice what she does maybe she would be able to afford a car if she was paying in proportional to what she makes but YOU have all this extra money and that's all that matters", "But it totally will be your fault when your girlfriend leaves you :)\n\nAnd say it as it is there's nothing SHE can do", "You could let her use your car as you said you would. You could also use some of the of your car to help her get a new, safer car.", "Lmao \"there's nothing we can do\" as you sell the car that is the perfect solution. \ud83e\udd23", "You're right, it's not your fault, and NO ONE is saying it's your fault. But when you LIKE someone, when you CARE FOR SOMEONE, you think about their safety and comfort and you make some sacrifices. \n\nWhen you don't, you sell you car even after you'd offered it to your gf to use. That's it.", "You could have given her your car like you promised but you decided to be a greedy fuck", "[removed]", "You\u2019re really all over this thread, huh?", "But if you get fired, you'll have no income.", "Mega AH and you don\u2019t seem to understand why.\n\nNobody is saying you need to give your gf your car. You offered, and again you can have a conversation with her and tell her it no longer makes sense. But then you go two steps deeper and say she can buy it. So it went from her borrowing your car, then you taking it back, and then you throwing salt on the wound letting her buy it when you know that isn\u2019t a real option.", "This doesn\u2019t add up.  No one I know with company car status has to check with their \u201csupervisor\u201d to see how it works.

This should end fun when your disillusioned behavior leaks into your work life.", "How did I know you were going to say you make twice what she does and split bills 50/50. Some things are obvious. Well, it's clear that you don't care that you're an AH (not just in this situation but in life) so I won't bother with you. I just hope your gf has an exit strategy. There's no future in dating little boys.", "Dude YTA wtf this just makes you look even worse", "So why are the groceries split 50/50. I highly doubt she eats how much you eat.  \n\u201cLetting her buy it off you\u201d is no different then her going and buying someone else\u2019s used car. Which you know she can\u2019t afford. Helping her would be to sell it to her at a discount not a premium.  \n\nThis is fine. Cause when that job fails you\u2019ll be fully without a car and buying another one will be twice what you are getting for the one you are selling.  I see this all the time.", "hopefully yall split", "I mean, yeah, I sort of get your point, but having 3 cards for 2 people seems kind of overkill, too.  \nFinancially, it also doesn't make a lot of sense, since the private car will just keep on losing value without the owner getting any mileage out of it.", "I am guessing you have never gone through a separation from a long term relationship.  Yes it is best when you are not married to get an agreement or both parties have no obligation to the \"Agreement\".  You may not like it but that is just how many many people act.  If there is no written agreement or texts that prove what was said then as far as they are concerned it never happened.  Not everyone is nice when it comes to money and property.  For many people you still need to get things in writing even after they get married.  My friend had that problem with her EX as he would never do anything he said he would if it was not in writing that he said he would do it. People can downvote all they like but it is true.", "I hope he gets fired because of his obnoxious self serving attitude", "Or they think he sucks and he doesn't pass the probation period", "Then I give the car back and use the money I got from my old car to buy a new one.", ">I mean a global pandemic swept through a ton of industries people thought they were safe at\u2026.we saw how that turned out.\n\nTen bucks says OP is an anti-masker", "Perfection.", "Saw that.

What a fucking slap in the face for your partner to know you can't afford something, and then offer to sell it to you at market price. I cannot imagine how demeaning and humiliating that must have felt.", "I hope it involves another guy from her work offering to give her rides and offering to fix her shit so she realizes she should find a better man. This guy is not a real man. I always make sure my girls have a safe ride and fix the shit that breaks along the way.", "And he can't even think about trying to help out his girlfriend. Can't they sell her car (that is probably worth a lot less than his) and they both keep the money and GF keeps OP's car? Doesn't that make more sense in the long run? \n\nOr GF can sell her car, and OP contributes a part of his take from the sale of his car and they buy 1 car that's reasonably priced?
