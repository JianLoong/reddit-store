With this job, I get a company vehicle. Before I accepted the offer, I was talking to my GF about the company car and I mentioned instead of selling my vehicle, I\u2019d let her use it in the winter.\n\nHer car is pretty bad in snow, even with snow tires on the car. Also, she\u2019s been having issues with it starting to stall while she\u2019s driving, especially when it gets really cold. \n\nHer car is paid off and between bills we split and her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a new car, so I figured this would save her the headache and we could talk about a newer car for her next year.\n\nAfter I accepted my offer, I looked to see what my car was worth and it\u2019s a lot more than I was thinking. I personally could really use that money, so I decided I would sell my car now while it\u2019s still worth that amount. \n\nI told my girlfriend when she got home from work and she lost her mind. She asked what she\u2019s supposed to do in the winter now, so I told her what the car is worth and asked if she\u2019d want to buy it from me, and that just pissed her off even more.\n\nI personally think she\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s my car. I even offered to let her buy it from me, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. But, I need to know, AITA?\n\nEdit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is. I\u2019m still selling the car. My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.", "created_utc": 1695483977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16q7sel/aita_for_selling_my_car_instead_of_letting_my_gf/", "score": 1429, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Several times over.\n\nSo, let's recap.\n\n* YOU got a great job offer with a company car.\n* GF's car is old, and UNSAFE in the winter, at least.\n* You, generously, said \"Hey, honey, I got this new job and a new car - you can use my old car.\" Everyone wins.\n* You then, inexplicably, investigated the value of your old car, and found out it was worth more than you thought. So, you decided to GO BACK ON YOUR PROMISE TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET.\n* Not content with just being that much of an asshole, you then said, knowing VERY well she couldn't afford it \"well you can just buy it from me if you want.\" (Let's say in your head, when you made the original offer, you thought the car was worth $10K. So, you were offering GF a loan of an item worth $10K. You later found out it was actually worth $15K, and got dollar signs in your eyes. Then you go to your GF and say \"Well, I offered you a $10K gift, but you're not worth $15K to me, so pay me $15K or I'm selling the car and keeping it all for myself.\")\n* You come on here for a judgment and get told, rightly, that you are a giant, gaping asshole.\n* You triple down on your assholery and say \"GF will suck it up\".\n\nI sure the fuck hope that GF kicks your toxic ass to the curb ASAP. Enjoy your lonely life.", "When she dumps you, can you use the company car to move? \n\n\n\"My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA\nBeen a while since I've seen such a clear case as well.\n\nYou offer the car, state she can't afford a new one, her car has problems, and then retract the offer. Just about as black and white as it gets.\n\nAs for the edit that she'll get over it \"like all the other fights\" ... I hope she doesn't.", "Wow your edit there at the end is spectacular. She will just get over it like all the other times? Really??!! YTA in SO many ways. If I was her id get out now. Someone who cant keep their word is massive red flag. It makes one wonder what happens when you make other bigger promises? Dont worry they are all rhetorical questions", "She doesn\u2019t need a new car\u2026 she needs a new boyfriend!", "YTA.  First for going back on your word where she could use the car and then demanding a full current selling price.  Perhaps you could come to an agreement where she sells her car, you take that money as a down payment, then she gets a loan in the spring or use the money she was going go save up and pays you back the rest then.  Not the best overall arrangement, but if you're so unwilling to accept the market risk come spring, it is an alternative to your all or nothing.", "YTA for not waiting til the spring. Yes the car may go down in value, but what value is your girlfriend\u2019s safety? This gives her time to save up for a car and be safe. Why is everyone so transactional nowadays?!", "She\u2019ll be \u201cex\u201d soon enough", "Omg not only YTA you\u2019re making a dumbass move. You\u2019re her live in boyfriend. Who do you think she is going to call when he car stalls and doesn\u2019t restart? Who will she call when she slides off the road and needs help? Who will help her with the expenses of towing, repairs, possible medical bills if she slides off the road and gets hurt?? It\u2019s you!!! Even if you don\u2019t have to pay for those things you will probably have to cover her part of rent if that happens. You\u2019re also showing you have no regards for the life and safety of your girlfriend. Why not give her your car and sell her old car and keep the money from that?", "Each fight she has to get over, is a strike. How many strikes do you think your relationship can take before you're out?\n\nIt sounds like you're dismissive and selfish since she's the one who has to get over it when you guys fight.", "Oh, he offered to sell it to her!  How thoughtful of you! How come she didn't think it on her own? She can't afford any car, but if she buys your expensive car solves everything. I lifted my eyebrows so high reading this sentence, that I began to look like Jeffrey Star\n\nNot only you backed down on your word, but you had to be an AH about it\n\nShe is also an AH if she stays in this relationship\n\nYTA. Major one", "Oh, my. That edit. Yeah, hope the GF comes to her senses.", "YTA, specifically because you changed it on her. You already promised her that she would have access to it. You would be wrong to go back on that.\n\nApologize and let her use the car.\n\nAlso, your heading is misleading.", "YTA! Not for wanting to sell the car while it\u2019s high-priced but for being an unreliable bf with no empathy. \nI understand that it probably was a positive surprise to see your car\u2018s value but why didn\u2019t you have a constructive conversation with your gf about what to do? \nCouldn\u2019t you have tried to find a solution together? Also, trying to sell your partner something at market value sounds disturbing!!", "Info: Why are you living with your GF. Just for convenience and to lower your bills? Or is it because you love her and want to build a life together because you possibly want them in you life forever?\n\nI ask because while I understand separate finances and even have most of mine separate from my wife\u2019s. I actually gave my better old car to them before we got married and never thought of selling it for my own financial gain because they were obviously a priority in my life and I expected the same from them if the roles were reversed.\n\nThe car is actually unsafe. It can leave her stranded and in danger of crashing in the upcoming winter. How much money was worth your GF risking that?", ">Edit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is. I\u2019m still selling the car. My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\n\nI hope she gets over it by getting over you.

Like, lol \"offered to let her buy it\" from you, knowing full well that she already only has enough money to make ends meet.", "YTA\n\nYou say you want to sell it now while the value is still high? That's not how car value works. Additionally, new car supplies are still low, and with the Auto Union strike in the US, that's not likely to change anytime soon. Meaning, used car value is going to remain high.\n\nYTA for a few reasons: you and gf discussed and came up with a plan together, then you alone decided to change it. Why not have a conversation about it again.\n\nThis is also really short sided in your part. Job stability is really low. You are planning to sell the only reliable vehicle before you've even started the job. What if you lose the job? What if the company decides it can't afford company cars anymore? What if your first day you realize there are restrictions on how much you can use the company car for personal reasons?\n\nAlso, the \"they won't fire me, they're short staffed\", have you not been paying attention? The jobs in the most short staffed sectors are the ones that do get cut the most frequently. Usually for \"not being a team player\", as in not doing the work of 6 people.\n\nYou are putting short term financial gain over long term stability. And your making decisions unilaterally that impact both of you", "YTA.\n\nYou told her that she could use it, and then you sold it without talking to her. You didn't even ask her if she wanted to buy it from you.", "> My gf will just get over it like she has with our other fights.\n\nBuddy don't count on it. It's a big breach of trust to say you'll do something (especially something that will be a huge help to her) and then turn around and not only not do it but offer it only if she pays you, when you already know she can't afford it.", "I\u2019m curious how much is this car going to earn you?

You come here for advice, are pretty well  unanimously declared the a****** and then you post an update that proves you've learned nothing.

You do realise everything you described about her car makes it dangerous in the colder weather, right? And that edit, oh man. If she has any sense she\u2019s out the door.", "YTA. Baffled by people who ask when they clearly don't care if they're assholes. Anyway, regardless of whether you care, you're an asshole of epic proportions. Would have simply been an asshole except for your last sentence. You don't care about your GF on the slightest. Not her opinion, not her comfort or safety and not her opinion of you.

Yes. Is it an AH move to tell someone you're going to give them something that will increase their safety and solve a problem for them, give them time to get used to the idea, then say JUST KIDDING and pull it back? Also yes.\n\nAnd making it clear that money matters more to you than your gf's feelings might be honest but it's really not a good way to keep a relationship alive, if that's a goal of yours.", "YTA for telling your GF she could use you car and then selling it. You should really look at the fine print on your company car deal as you may not be allowed to use it except for work related travel, I.E. to and from work.", "YTA and after reading your responses too,  I hope she leaves you.

You created the situation you are in by offering before doing any research on your cars value. The fact that it\u2019s worth what it\u2019s worth now and may dip in value later is irrelevant.", "YTA, and I\u2019m not really sure how you don\u2019t see that.

With this job, I get a company vehicle. Before I accepted the offer, I was talking to my GF about the company car and I mentioned instead of selling my vehicle, I\u2019d let her use it in the winter.\n\nHer car is pretty bad in snow, even with snow tires on the car. Also, she\u2019s been having issues with it starting to stall while she\u2019s driving, especially when it gets really cold. \n\nHer car is paid off and between bills we split and her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a new car, so I figured this would save her the headache and we could talk about a newer car for her next year.\n\nAfter I accepted my offer, I looked to see what my car was worth and it\u2019s a lot more than I was thinking. I personally could really use that money, so I decided I would sell my car now while it\u2019s still worth that amount. \n\nI told my girlfriend when she got home from work and she lost her mind. She asked what she\u2019s supposed to do in the winter now, so I told her what the car is worth and asked if she\u2019d want to buy it from me, and that just pissed her off even more.\n\nI personally think she\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s my car. I even offered to let her buy it from me, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. But, I need to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So you\u2019re willing to let her continue to drive a vehicle that could be considered a safety hazard, rather than let her use yours? You also mentioned the bills and her student loans. It\u2019s possible that she can\u2019t afford to buy your vehicle. This is an opportunity for you to step up to help your girlfriend, but you\u2019re just thinking of yourself. Also, what was the point in even asking the question when you already had your mind made up as to what you were going to do?

It happens; not everyone matures at the same rate. I admit I think I am immature. You're still on \"me me me\" and \"not my problem\" phase. And she'll get over it like she always does; big assumption for a person you've been living with for a year.\n\nThe problem is you make a lot of assumptions about how much crap she'll take, her friends' reaction when they hear of this, and her family's reaction when they hear of this. It's one thing to get into a minor disagreement, but another to do this where she'll have all winter to think about this; and if the winter is really bad she will have a really long time to think. Being on the wrong side of her friends and family is not going to help your cause; she will be hearing how she could do better and if she values any of their opinions it's not going to help your relationship.\n\nHopefully you have other redeeming qualities beyond the standard cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry. Taking back a promise like that is harsh. Again, doing something like that and being unrepentent is a sign of lack of maturity, or you just don't care as it's just another relationship. Whatever you do - good luck.

If u promised it to her for her to use u could also add a caveat to the deal to explain hey even though I\u2019m willing to help u, there are other things that are currently on my mind that I may even want to sell the car. So keep that in mind something like that and let her know. She couldn\u2019t have been upset then because u broke down to her what she was getting into. \n\nYou could\u2019ve even did it like this, u randomly had your car value checked and got an answer of how much money you would get\u2026 u should\u2019ve had immediately discussed it with her what has changed in the situation and explain the why and try to persuade her to see her from your point of view. Hopefully u was using the money that u got from the car to figure out a contingency plan for her car situation because it ties back to u offering to help. \n\nAnyway u had and have so many different opportunities to communicate with her and unfortunately at this point due to you not sharing that info it has become a trust issue. Hope u guys can hash it out and figure out a solution", ">Edit: so I am the AH, but it is what it is. I\u2019m still selling the car.
