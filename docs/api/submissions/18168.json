That's very unfortunate for your stepsister, but everyone knows what stillbirths are but no reason to spook a pregnant woman. Maybe because I can't think of any even I'd enjoy less than a baby shower, but it seems like something that could trigger unhappiness your stepsister, so it seems best for her and your wife to avoid an issue. It's not like you want to cut your stepsister out of your life completely.", "NTA\n\nStepsister is allowed to feel this way. These are reasonable thoughts.\n\nBut they aren't helpful thoughts to share with someone who is pregnant.\n\nHonestly, I'd play keep away from her for awhile. Let your wife make the call. She should make the decision if she even wants the chance right now of running into SSIL so she wants to skip events for that side of your family.\n\nYour stepsister has been thru a traumatic experience but she can't force that trauma on everyone else.", "I feel sorry for your stepsister that her child was stillborn.\n\nBut that doesn't give her the right to scare your wife and make her miserable. \n\nYour stepsister's misery loves company...\n\n*That she refused to be excluded because of that event.*\n\nYour stepsister also seems very entitled...\n\nNTA for protecting your wife and keeping the stress away from her and your unborn child.", "NTA.  But, I do think you should concentrate on your wife's perceptions and support rather than your stepsister's.  There are always negative people around and we all have to learn to deal with them.  Yes, bad things still happen in pregnancies, but most manage to get through just fine.  Help your wife keep her focus where it needs to be -- on enjoying her pregnancy and looking forward to your child's birth.  Make sure she feels strong enough to do this.  If not, then I can understand why you would want to limit her contact with your stepsister right now.  \n\nFWIW, I'm sure your stepsister was traumatized and still suffering from her bad experience.  Maybe you could suggest she get some counseling to help her deal with her loss so that she no longer feels the need to warn other prospective mothers that this could happen to them too.  These are her fears and she needs to deal with them so she doesn't inflict them on others. I'm so sorry for what happened to her, but this is clearly not the norm.", "NTA. What a horrible thing to say to your wife, she clearly has no remorse and her attending the shower would just upset your wife.", "Nope, not one bit. NTA\n\nMost people are self aware enough to know you censor yourself in certain situations.  Around pregnant women there are thing you just keep to yourself. Your stepsister doesn't see the problem. Lucky for you, you calmed your wife down and brought her back to the good place.", "NTA - I don't think your stepsister is intentionally being an asshole, though. Assuming your stepsister's loss is semi-recent, it's understandable that she would not be able to keep her composure in this context, but it's not fair on your wife to experience that distress either - and if being around your pregnant wife brought on too many difficult emotions, the baby shower is probably going to be x100 worse. When my SIL's fiance died a week before their wedding, she skipped on family weddings because she recognised that that environment would distress her.\n\nHowever, I do think you should have a conversation with your step sister explaining that what she said frightened your wife and that she shouldn't have said that to her, and really this conversation should have happened in isolation rather than in relation to the babyshower as now that conflict resolution is hanging over the babyshower. Your dad telling her made things a lot more complicated.", "NTA if step-sister can't realize there are boundaries in what you say to someone God only knows what would happen at the shower.", "NTA - my ex-MIL had a baby die of SIDS between my ex-husband and his brother. That evil, horrific, monstrous woman harped on it my entire pregnancy. All I heard from her was my baby could die. My pregnancy was EXTREMELY high risk and I was on full bed rest for 11 weeks - all while listening to this woman regale me with tails of her dead baby (who would have been almost 30 by that time). She caused me so much stress and fear and, to this day (22 years later) I still think part of the reason my child was born 6 weeks early was from stress. \n\nNTA - I\u2019m so sorry for what your SIL went through. I\u2019m sure it was traumatic and I sympathize. However, what she did was cruel and malicious. I would keep her far away from your wife. I wish my ex had kept my ex-mil away.", "No, YWNBTA.\n\nYou're looking out for your wife, and that's your priority.\n\nIf your step-sister is upsetting her, then she shouldn't come.", "NTA and frankly it would be better for your wife not to have your stepsister there. It's a shower for your wife so...", "nta she was being cruel", "Oh good God, NTA\n\nUnless your step sister's loss was recent AND your wife was flaunting her pregnancy, you don't say things like that to a pregnant woman.\nIt's like telling a 5 year old that Santa isn't real.", "NAH. But having had a stillbirth myself, I regularly have to stop myself from saying this kind of thing. I think it often when I see people post about genetic testing and anatomy scans, often seeking validation that everything will be fine. Not because I want to scare anybody, but because the experience was just so excruciating and most people don\u2019t consider it a possibility. Unfortunately it does happen. People do get terrible news, pregnancies end, and babies die. I would take her comments as trying to spare your wife and you from her pain, and include her in the shower. Stillbirth is an incredibly isolating, painful thing to go through.", "NTA. Step sister went through something awful. The fact that she decided to slyly lay that on your wife was appalling. She shouldn't be there. She has scared your wife, is not sorry for doing so, and will want to defend herself, if she shows up to the shower. Stand strong.", "NTA. Kudos to you for loving and protecting your wife. I hope your baby's birth goes perfectly and you enjoy every minute with your beautiful baby.", "NTA The chances of having a stillborn are 1 out of 175 births. That\u2019s about 21,000 babies a year so it\u2019s actually not that high of a chance.  Most still births are caused by genetic or structural birth defects. The other percentage is when the placenta or fetus somehow become infected. The cause of those infections is bacteria traveling up through a woman\u2019s v****a and cervix. So your step sister is way off with her \u201cwarning\u201d because neither of you share dna. Her genetics are completely different from yours. She should really educate herself before spewing her hate filled bitterness.", "NTA...  your wife comes 1st", "I never mention my miscarriages or stillbirth to anyone who is expecting a baby. That's horrid, IMO. No reason on earth to spoil anyone's joy.\n\nNTA. Your sister needs to see somebody about her trauma, rather than just water the earth with it.", "NTA yes she\u2019s had trauma but only an asshole uses that as an excuse to traumatize others.", "NTA bc who tf says that to a pregnant woman. I understand stepsister went through a tragedy, and her and her partner broke up in the aftermath. That does not mean she gets to say crap like that. \n\nStepsister needs therapy if she\u2019s not already in it bc all I could think was if it was her toddler or preteen that died, she would say that\u2019s why you can\u2019t let kids play outside, go to school, etc live. Life happens, bad shit happens, but being paranoid that tragedy is just around the corner and it\u2019s going to be a watershed moment of loss is not a good headspace for her or for her to share with most people. Having a kid is stressful enough without someone sharing dark, and terrible thoughts about bad things happening to your unborn or current kids.", "NTA - how can she say that it wasn't her fault that she told your wife that she should worry about that?  SHE ABSOLUTELY DID\n\nI really do not understand your step-sisters thinking that she is refusing to be excluded?  she is not invited, scratch that, she has been officially UNINVITED.\n\nAlso, if any of your family even act like they are going to allow your step-sister to attend the shower, they should be uninvited as well.\n\nif your step-sister will be there on Friday, i would definitely NOT go.  imo you need to send a STRONG MESSAGE to your entire family - no one is allowed to terrify your wife like that.", "NTA. Ss is toxic. She doesn't get to dictate who is welcome at your wife's shower.", "NAH. You step sister was obviously triggered by being around your pregnant wife and that caused her to put her foot in her mouth. Trauma is a powerful thing. Maybe she thought she was being helpful because she wishes someone had told her that still birth is a real possibility. Hopefully she\u2019s getting help to deal with her loss. It\u2019s understandable that you want her to keep her distance from your wife for now. However, you should have discussed this with her personally instead of telling your dad first. Because she heard about it through the grapevine, she\u2019s not going to fully understand what she did wrong. She thinks your ostracizing her because she lost a baby so anything you say to her now will sound you\u2019re trying to downplay those feelings.", "nta\n\nyour stepsister is like a crab in a bucket. she doesnt want others to be happy and have what she couldnt, so she will pull them back down to her level.\n\nabsolutely nasty.", "NAH.\n\nBut seriously, how could your wife not have thought about it? Nothing is guaranteed. Hell nothing is guaranteed once you have the baby. I had a cousin die of SIDS and a friend from high school\u2019s oldest also died of SIDS. \n\nBecoming a parent is truly learning to live with soul-crushing fear in the back of your brain while being inundated with heart-bursting joy and mind numbing monotony all at the same time\u2026forever.\n\nYour stepsister is going through trauma. She\u2019s probably trying to help spare others from the same trauma, which is impossible. \n\nI don\u2019t think that you should be required to have her at the baby shower where it\u2019s bound to be a difficult event for everyone. \n\nHence NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she is there call her out publicly.  Out right demand she repeat what she told your wife to everyone.  See how fast she back peddles and runs out of there.

There\u2019s a huge difference between thinking about telling someone that a stillbirth may happen, vs actually telling them.\n\n> she told my wife to not get too excited until the baby gets there.\n\n??? Literally why would you say this to a pregnant woman. OP\u2019s wife is also 7 months in and has been found crying daily bc of that comment. Stepsister is causing unnecessary stress to a pregnant woman. This isn\u2019t just stress over something petty, it seems like wife is worried the baby will straight up d*e and it\u2019s all thanks  to stepsister\u2019s callous comment.\n\nStepsister is not sparing her any pain. Even if this was a cautionary comment, it\u2019s poorly worded and gave the opposite effect.\n\nThink about it. 7 months, almost at the end of the finish line and getting closer to being able to hold her baby in her arms. Suddenly she gets a bomb dropped on her that implies her baby might straight up d-e?? It\u2019s a possibility ofc, but to point it out like that just seems cruel.\n\nAnd before you say it\u2019s not cruel, I want to point out that telling this to a pregnant woman isn\u2019t helping them in any way and it caused distress to wife in this situation. This is really sad for stepsister but she went out of her way to make this comment when she could\u2019ve graciously kept her mouth shut.", "Trying to spare them? How??? She shifted fear and pain to them. She, and you, need help dealing with your tragic losses.", ">I regularly have to stop myself from saying this kind of thing.\n\nI want to understand but really, really can't.\n\nWould parents who lost an older child tell other parents not to get too attached because their child might die before them?", "She should go ahead and cancel Christmas right now. She won't be invited to that either.", "I see what you\u2019re saying. My heart is soft for the stepsister because I can relate to her pain, but it would be hard to hear pregnant all the same. I would probably not include her at the shower.", "No, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s like a protective instinct to want to warn when you\u2019ve been through something like that, but I also wouldn\u2019t want to steal someone\u2019s joy and have them worry unnecessarily. That\u2019s the only way I can explain it. In pregnancy it feels like there\u2019s certain times you can feel \u201csafe.\u201d After you see the heartbeat the risk of miscarriage goes way down, then 12 weeks, then after a good 20 week anatomy scan, then birth. But you\u2019re never really safe from something happening, and that\u2019s true after baby is born too. My stillbirth wasn\u2019t completely unexpected, he had trisomy 18 that was confirmed pretty late. Along the way I regularly heard \u201coh this happened to me, they thought baby had xyz, and the doctors were wrong and baby was fine,\u201d and I think it was meant to be helpful, and made it hurt all the more when we got the diagnosis and quickly soon after lost him. I think if I had a person or two say \u201cwe had this happen, and the outcome didn\u2019t go the way we hoped, here\u2019s how we survived,\u201d it would have helped a little bit. And unfortunately people lose totally healthy babies for no discernible reason in the end. It\u2019s truly heartbreaking - a pain I would never wish upon anyone.", "I think that\u2019s the issue here. The main point is that OP wants to know if they\u2019re an AH for not inviting her to the shower.\n\nIt seems like pregnancy could be trigger for stepsister, hence why she shouldn\u2019t be invited to the shower. The issue here is that she\u2019s doubling down on her cruel comment and she still wants to be invited to the shower. She\u2019s not taking no for an answer.", "Thank you for being willing to share your story and adding nuance to the situation at hand.", ">It\u2019s like a protective instinct to want to warn when you\u2019ve been through something like that,\n\nI can believe that it feels like that to you, but honestly to me it seems like more like a need to have your own pain acknowleged. Which is of course understandable, in principle.\n\nEvery action humans can do (including simply existing) has some degree of danger involved. Everything can kill you or someone you love. It's just varying degrees of rarity.\n\nAnd humans can't function when they consciously acknowledge all the dangers.\n\nBut usually people do know the dangers, unconsciously. They generally don't need to be reminded.", "It\u2019s a protective instinct to tell a pregnant woman to not get too excited because her baby could still die? Wow, you\u2019re a fucking asshole, and having a stillbirth doesn\u2019t change that fact.", "Lol, thank you. Maybe add a critical thinking course into your college schedule there, child."]}
