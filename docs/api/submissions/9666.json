I was prepared to call you an AH, but no, you did the right thing. Between harassing customers for money and getting drunk on hand sanitizer there, that\u2019s a major liability. Keeping to yourself in the lot is one thing, even if the car has major damage like a broken window. This sort of behavior means they could be a danger to customers and employees, especially as they\u2019ve done it multiple times. The real AH here is homelessness, the fact that housing is so unaffordable, and the fact that this country does nothing to try to combat the problem. Or, actually, I guess some places do something\u2026taking away any space someone can lay down in is technically something.
