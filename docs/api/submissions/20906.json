Having a baby will not magically fix everything in your relationship like many hope it will. You and your husband need to be on the same team moving forward. Starting a family is a great and beautiful thing for sure, but financial and emotional planning are hugely important - definitely do not cut any corners here, and try to make your partner see that this shouldn't be about winning an argument, rather this is all in preparation for giving a potential child the best home possible for them. \n\nAll the best", "NTA. He's right though that he's allowed to spend money on his hobbies. Perhaps come to an agreement of either spending $50 a month on a car, or you spending $10k on the garden.

You 'make up for' your lower income by doing all the housework, along with his comments about essentially \"it's my money, so I can spend it as I want\". This is a sticky subject but it seems like his bottom line is that he considers his voice to be more important than yours in your household finances, because it's his job and work that bring in 3/4 of your household income. That's something you need to address, I expect. As I said, it's super sticky  because how do you quantify, exactly, the financial 'contribution' associated with managing the household, and in the future childcare responsibilities?

Maybe hearing the same message you have been telling him, but coming from a different source, might have a better chance of getting through to him. \n\nPerhaps creating an excel sheet where you and your husband together perform a budgeting exercise, where you write a list of all your potential expenses, planned and unplanned, that would come up with having a child. Maybe seeing the numbers add up and going through this exercise together could help your communication.\n\nAlso if you were to start working full time so that there is less of an imbalance between incomes if that really bothers him, then who will care for the child?
