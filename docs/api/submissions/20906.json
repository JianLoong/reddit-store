Dude is still a moron", ">I would put my foot down, and I would start using birth control until this is resolved. Household savings should be used for the benefit of the household, and he is being incredibly selfish with his money. You are seeing his true self come out.

I make up for it by doing all the housework.\n\nIf you both work the same amount of hours, you shouldn't be \"making up\" for it. You are partners so it's unfair you get less free time than him. \n\nAlso, your house must look like junk yard with so many useless cars.

May I suggest couples therapy and financial classes. Like your guys combined income will allow a middle income life with little debt if you plan accordingly. \n\nBut from your post it appears your husband thinks he can spend like a millionaire and really needs to be spanked down to reality. He is going to be a dad time for him to fire up and understand that sometimes he can't spend money on an asset whose value tanks the moment you drive off the lot. \n\nAlso there is a rule on how much to spend on a car.

You spend $50/month on gardening, which is 3% of your income. He should be given the same allotment, about 2k a year to spend on his car \"hobby.\" Thar should satisfy his excitement for cars and keep your savings intact. At least according to his logic.", "Lol. The $50 a month will get him admission into the track twice (as a spectator) on test and tune days, and the 10k will get him a roller with no safety cage and more than likely have a few scrapes and dents on it.

And you do all of the chores because he wouldn't do them?\n\nSo who is going to take care of the kids? If he is simply a sperm donor then I don't see the point of even being married. What if something happens to you? Is he going to pawn the kids onto a family member or a random woman? He is not going to change any diaper, do any bath, cook any meal, never help with homework, nothing?\n\nAre you living in like the middle ages or something??? Is that why you think you have to accept this set up?\n\nYou are being an AH to yourself here. Good luck when he crashes with the dumb car and you have to clean his a\\*\\*, do all the chores, take care of the kids, and also work.

On 64k a year, he is NOT going to be able to afford anything that will run consistently, and he won't be able to afford the parts to fix it. I have been part of the racing community since I was 14. My 1st car over 30 yrs ago was 50k by the time engines, tires, transmissions, rear ends, etc were all bought. Now my dad, one of my sons, and I have a car together. We all contribute to it. It's just about completed, and it's in excess of $150k, probably closer to 200k. We do have some spare parts and are able to fix things ourselves. If his dream is to be competitive, I dont see how on earth he could do that, have a child, and support a family on 64k. Even with junkyard finds, he is still going to need the funds to fix what he finds. And if he is new to the community, he is going to have a hard time getting help from other drivers. My dad has been part of the community for over 50 yrs, so we have been able to save some money by bartering services for some things. A newbie isn't going to have that option. \n\nIt seems as though OP and her spouse have 2 entirely different life plans, and they should really discuss this before having a child and not being able to afford it. OP should not settle for the \"I will buy it and if I need to I will sell it\" statement from her spouse either. Throwing a bunch of money at a car and having an incomplete and \"cheap\" build will not sell well, and there is a chance that he would lose money. Most racers lose money weekly anyway (lol).", "I am hoping your sarcastic because no it will not unless he wants it to change.", "Ok so if your husband uses all the savings to get a car, what happens if a critter needs an emergency vet visit the following week?  Because that's typically when they have medical issues.", "If you can't even afford to insure all the cars, then this is crazy. I reiterate this, kids are fucking expensive. I have 2 small ones, and no matter how many times you here it you never realize how expensive it is until you have one. You need to put an ultimatum down and saying he wants the car your leaving. I hate ultimatums but 64m a year ain't shit. And a track car is way more expensive than that. This is a hill to die on because if y9u have a child with this guy, what's he going to do when it comes down to fixing his track car or football fees for the kids? Of course he's going to sY the kids don't need to be in extra curricular activities.  If he's putting himself first bow he always will.", "Can't you find a full-time job and then share the chores? If you share the chores then you'll see if he actually would be a partner. You'll see if he would step up if you have kids. \n\nRight now you are getting a pay cut so that you can play bang maid.", "NTA. Please have a very long think about having a kid with this guy. This sounds like the early stages of financial abuse. He's also acting like $50 in gardening costs a month is equal to a track hobby. \n\nI doubt this is something that therapy can fix, though you can try. I know reddit jumps the gun on divorce, but to me this is as clear as one person wanting kids and one person not wanting kids; or one person saving to FIRE and the other partner wanting to blow it all paycheck to paycheck.", "NTA, there is a saying in racing.
