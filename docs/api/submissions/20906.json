That's something you need to address, I expect.

Maybe hearing the same message you have been telling him, but coming from a different source, might have a better chance of getting through to him. \n\nPerhaps creating an excel sheet where you and your husband together perform a budgeting exercise, where you write a list of all your potential expenses, planned and unplanned, that would come up with having a child. Maybe seeing the numbers add up and going through this exercise together could help your communication.\n\nAlso if you were to start working full time so that there is less of an imbalance between incomes if that really bothers him, then who will care for the child?

Fair rate would be $20 per hour (low because you are not having taxes taken out, or other normal withdrawls).  He owes you from his income $560 per week, of which you should contribute some to the household expenses, minus what you contribute from your job, but the rest is yours to keep.
