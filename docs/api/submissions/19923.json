We've been living together for 5 Years and in that time she got married but her and her husband couldn't afford the rent and things without me. When we started dating she had 3 kids none of them mine and I would help out a lot with them wherever I could. She had me help homeschool and basic needs for taking care of them. I didn't have a problem with that until it started to turn into her napping all the time or smoking weed and taking edibles, and I was the only one watch, teaching and raising the kids. Needless to say I eventually blew up at her because anytime I would bring it up she would blow me off or she would help for a bit and then stop again.\n\nI ended things with her but stayed in the house because at the time we were in the pandemic but in that span of 6 Months she got married and her husband was a nice enough guy. But she started to bitch at me that I wasn't doing enough to help or contribute with the kids. And when I would try and make peace and help with them, suddenly I am overstepping my bounds. So I've since told her I'm not doing school with them anymore or watch them for any reason. I can't help but feel bad for the kids because they haven't done any school in the last 10 months and the youngest (8m) is so far behind that if he went to public school he wouldn't be able to understand things at all.  \n\nShould I buckle and start helping with them again or stand my ground on the matter? I can't really afford to go anywhere else but living here has really started to weigh on me.

These kids aren't your responsibility and your ex is taking advantage of you & trying to convince you they are. If you can, I strongly suggest moving out asap as setting reasonable boundaries isn't working, and you staying but not helping the kids will likely be confusing for them vs. if you moved out entirely, which is more of a clean break.
