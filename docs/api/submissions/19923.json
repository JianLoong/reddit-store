We've been living together for 5 Years and in that time she got married but her and her husband couldn't afford the rent and things without me. When we started dating she had 3 kids none of them mine and I would help out a lot with them wherever I could. She had me help homeschool and basic needs for taking care of them. I didn't have a problem with that until it started to turn into her napping all the time or smoking weed and taking edibles, and I was the only one watch, teaching and raising the kids. Needless to say I eventually blew up at her because anytime I would bring it up she would blow me off or she would help for a bit and then stop again.\n\nI ended things with her but stayed in the house because at the time we were in the pandemic but in that span of 6 Months she got married and her husband was a nice enough guy. But she started to bitch at me that I wasn't doing enough to help or contribute with the kids. And when I would try and make peace and help with them, suddenly I am overstepping my bounds. So I've since told her I'm not doing school with them anymore or watch them for any reason. I can't help but feel bad for the kids because they haven't done any school in the last 10 months and the youngest (8m) is so far behind that if he went to public school he wouldn't be able to understand things at all.  \n\nShould I buckle and start helping with them again or stand my ground on the matter? I can't really afford to go anywhere else but living here has really started to weigh on me.

These kids aren't your responsibility and your ex is taking advantage of you & trying to convince you they are. If you can, I strongly suggest moving out asap as setting reasonable boundaries isn't working, and you staying but not helping the kids will likely be confusing for them vs. if you moved out entirely, which is more of a clean break. Also, I would consider calling CPS on your ex for child neglect.", "You need to report her to the local school district.

At this point, CPS needs to learn about the plight of these kids, and you need to beat feet.\n\nYou say you can\u2019t afford to move out, but things have progressed to the point where you can\u2019t afford (mentally) to NOT move out.\n\nETA: NTA", "Info - so the pandemic was like 3yrs ago.

Homeschooling mama here. You need to report that to the local school district as truancy. Parents like this give us homeschoolers a bad name.\n\nNTA. But your ex absolutely is. It's called educational neglect and it is not okay!", "NTA.", "NTA- time to make her move out, or you. You are not responsible for her kids and you are not going to be. They aren\u2019t even your kids to begin with. Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you or make you feel bad about it either because she is the parent. Not you.", "NTA\u2026move out.  She is remarried.

These kids aren't your responsibility, but educational neglect is abuse and should be reported. \n\nJust move out and report her.

Also I feel OP needs to move out.", "yes exactly!!!", "We started living together in 2019, pandemic started in 2020, we broke up in the middle of 2021, she was married in January of 2022, I last helped with them in September or October last year.", "That seems like a very strange timeliness of events. More specifically, how she got married within 6 months of breaking up with you.\n\nHonestly, I would try to move out of there as soon as possible. I get that you're trying to be helpful because the husband is nice and all, but you're not doing yourself any favours by staying there", "NTA, that said I would turn her in to child services and find a new place to live.  These aren't your kids.", "NTA, but does she have family that are capable of raising these kids?? Sounds like you not only need to report her for educational neglect/truancy, but also parental neglect to social services. I fear that if you move out and can\u2019t keep an eye on them something bad will happen!! These kids obviously don\u2019t have anyone but you, if you feel comfortable helping with their schooling, do it for them (your choice), but not for her! I have to ask, are they homeschooled because she doesn\u2019t want to get up and take them or what\u2019s the reason (if you are comfortable answering this)?? \nAlso, if she has family members who are capable of raising these babies, get with them about getting these kids on some form of abandonment or with the help of social services.", "NTA.\n\nThe bond you formed with the kids enabled her to manipulate you into continually doing more for her and them than you had any onus to do.\n\nYou\u2019re a good person and you\u2019ve tried but she is truly taking advantage of you. The audacity to confront you about your lack of effort for her kids when she is now married? \n\nThese kids are her responsibility, alongside her husbands, you are the roommate. You pay your share of bills and you share the house, not responsibility of her children. \n\nYou need to move out or she needs to move out with her husband and children. Do not feel guilt, when you guys finally stop living together, you tried your best for them, it is their mother who is not and as sad as it may be about the situation they are in, that is not your responsibility to carry that around with you.\n\nReport her to the school board or whatever it is, responsible for seeing that her kids get the education they deserve, and make sure they know that she is being negligent and risking their education and development by not teaching them. \n\nBecause as someone witnessing it in the same house, that is something YOU should do.\n\nNothing is your responsibility, you are NTA, you are a good person being manipulated.", "NTA. They are her kids and her responsibility. You need to move out. She will continue to use and abuse you", "What the fuck is going on here? OP, you need to move out.", "NTA. Stand your ground and stop being a doormat. You should move out and get away.", "You need to report this woman and save those children and move out", "NTA it's not your responsibility but this is not a healthy situation. Definitely start saving and looking at other options. Even if you have to more with a roommate.", "NTA, what the hell are you doing there? Get out of that place and lead your own life, it's not your family, it's not your children, nothing ties you to that place", "Call CPS and get them out of your place???", "Nope.", "NTA but why have you even let this go on?  She needs to go.  You need to report her.   No, do not buckle and start helping with them again, you need them out of your life completely.", "It's not a question of whether you're an asshole, but how dumb you are", "CPS! You are definitely NTA, but please get them involved for the kids\u2018 sakes", "Not just the local school district,  but whatever their local CPS type organization is. Report simultaneously to both, throw in the cops too if needed. \n\nShe's intentionally neglecting her children in favor of selfish pursuits.

You say you can't afford to, but I would rather live in the hood and room with strangers off craigslist than live with my ex and her new husband and raise her children.", "OP you are way too nice.  They are taking MASSIVE advantage of you.  \n\n\u201cHey babe, let\u2019s get married.  Sure I have kids, but my sucker ex boyfriend still sticks around for some reason and takes care of them.  No sex, no girlfriend, no pay, but he does it anyway!!\u201d\n\nYou deserve better.  Find a new place, and report them to CPS for not schooling their kids.  If they are that lazy, why aren\u2019t they sending their kids to school??", "I mean, she doesn\u2019t sound like someone who makes the best decisions from what OP has written here.", "Sounds like marrying the guy might actually be one of her better decisions. He actually likes him so he must be a decent husband."]}
