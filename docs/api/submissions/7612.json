I have no other way of making sure that they have a place over their heads and food to eat.\n\nLately my nephew has been acting up. He was suspended from school. He has been bringing friends to the apartment and making noise late into the night. I have had to deal with the cops a few times over his behavior. My sister can not or will not control him. His father is not in the picture. I am just done. My sister and I are all the family he has.\n\nSo I sat him down while my sister was at work and I showed him the paperwork for terminating their tenancy and then evicting them. I told him that if he caused me to have to deal with the police one more time or he was suspended again that I would file the paperwork and they would be evicted in 30 days. Since I know that they cannot afford to live in this city on what my sister earns it would mean moving somewhere else far away from his friends.\n\nI told him he had to decide for himself if he wanted to be homeless or in foster care. I drove him down to the homeless encampment and pointed out the complete lack of internet access and showers.\n\nHe was very quiet. When his mom got home he told her everything. My sister came to yell at me about being a controlling asshole. She said that I was not his parent and that I had no right to talk to him like that or to try and discipline him. I just gave her a copy of the paperwork and the relevant laws about evicting people. I also didn't go grocery shopping for them that week.\n\nI talked to them together and told them to come see me with their decision. That was three weeks ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago they came to see me. They said that they were sorry for their behavior and that they would not be causing me any more problems. I took them at their word and gave them groceries for a couple of days until I had time to go get them more.\n\nIt has been very quiet at the apartment and when I see them they are polite but they are keeping to themselves. My sister and I have spoken and she is still mad at me for what I did.

All of which is a long-winded way of saying bored or angry kids tend to react badly in the moment. If you can find any spare cash for therapy/counselling/sport etc, it might defuse things.

They are clearly mostly TA here.\n\nThat said, did you tell your sister you planned to give her son THIS wake-up call?  Did you go behind her back with this?  Not because the kid needs to be coddled, or because she's Mother of the Year here, but because that's a hell of a thing to put on someone else's kid.  It also could have backfired spectacularly if the mom got blindsided and instead protected her precious baby from mean old landlord-family.  \n\nI'm glad it's worked out well for you, but I guarantee you that in the long-term, your sister is wondering what she might find out after the fact next time, and what her son may be threatened with next time.

Either way, you could\u2019ve included your sister in the plan ahead of time and worked together rather than threaten her and her son with homelessness, which is so cold to do to your family. It\u2019s kind to buy groceries, but your sister should apply for assistance so she isn\u2019t relying on you.

Notice how once they apologized he so graciously allowed them food? That's sick. Yeah, something has to be done, but maybe something that involved both the sister and kid and a serious chat that could have been like the one he did with only the 13 yo.

If you look it is literally only when someone chooses to judge based on some other question than what I asked.", "Your landlord would absolutely threaten to evict you if you're causing issues that involve the cops frequently visiting, don't be ridiculous.", "No, honey. You're doing a nice thing by being an understanding landlord. You can stop at any time. \n\nI think you buy their groceries and pay utilities because they're your family, which is again, a nice thing... \n\n...but you're addressing adult problems with a minor. Maybe the minor is to blame, and maybe they aren't. Either way, it's the parents decision.

Please make sure your nephew knows that then, he can\u2019t feel responsible for sheltering himself and his mom\u2026\n\nAlso, please read my comment beyond the cops.

Good luck, you\u2019re doing a lot already.", "Oh... this adds a lot to the context. \n\nI feel like your sister would understand moreso than your nephew, and addressing your concerns in more of a \"house rules\" type setting/dialogue would get the message across better to everyone involved", "Lol. You asked one redditer should i have let cop take him and asked anothet\nMy options were to do what I did, just evict them, or let the cops take the kid and not help my sister with the lawyer. What was my best option?\nClearly, you made up your mind. And now you are attacking me who felt compassion for you, twice wished you luck and judged nta.

A CHILD who from what you shared in your post is going through a really rough time.  That \"discussion\" you needed to have was with his MOTHER!  YOU KNOW THE ADULT in that situation?

Your nephew is like that for a reason, i dont think threatening him with homelessness is going to do him any good. Yes, he will shut up and behave, but the problems are still there and he wont trust you anymore (if he ever did).

Some kids literally do not know what real life consequences look like until it is spelled out in front of them. Your sister has failed to raise her son with appropriate consequences for poor behaviour. I think this has been a big wake up call for them both and hopefully you won\u2019t have any further problems.", "Your sister being upset is expected, but misplaced. According to your post you did not speak to him in a disrespectful manner, yell at him, call him names or anything like that.\n\nNor did you try to discipline him. You told him, that as his landlord, that he, as a tenant, were causing problems for you, and that you will not allow him to continue to do things that cause the cops to be called to your home. You gave him a warning that if it happens again, you would not continue to rent to them and they will have to find a new place to live.\n\nThis is all done under the landlord/tenant relationship. \n\nNow, the part about not being suspended again is outside that relationship, and is more to do with him being your nephew. Your intentions are good, as I am sure you just want him to do well and not miss out on his education. But putting that as a condition of continuing to rent to them is a bit out of line. \n\n14 is a hard age to handle, as they really start to test out their limits. Parenting a teen with both parents can be hard, and doing it solo even more so. And since the one parent is the opposite gender, your nephew doesn't really have someone to show him proper adult male behaviors. None of this is an excuse, just pointing out some potential reasons as to his behavior. \n\nYour sister needs some help with her son, and may not know who to turn to, how to ask, or even that she needs help. But she does. You are already doing alot, but it is obvious you care about them both, so doing more may seem like your are taking on too much. But could you talk to your sister and ask her if she needs help with him?

Jesus. That\u2019s a damn quick slippery slope into a lot more trouble. \n\nYou didn\u2019t threaten him!\n\nYou simply explained that YOU were not going to deal with the police anymore for him and that YOU would simply be unable to provide housing for HIM. And his behaviour is his choice. \n\nI mean he\u2019s 13. \n\nYour sister is definitely not parenting him. Poor kid. He\u2019s lucky to have you!", "NTA. I like the way you think.", "NTA. You showed them the harsh reality of not having your support but then again they should have not taken you for granted in the first place.", "Whoa, that was somewhat harsh what you did and it's true you're not his parent.  What you definitely are is their landlord however and as their landlord although you pushed boundaries you did let him know clearly that like any other landlord you do not tolerate multiple police visits to your property for his behavior.
