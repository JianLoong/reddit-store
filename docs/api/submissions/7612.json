I have no other way of making sure that they have a place over their heads and food to eat.\n\nLately my nephew has been acting up. He was suspended from school. He has been bringing friends to the apartment and making noise late into the night. I have had to deal with the cops a few times over his behavior. My sister can not or will not control him. His father is not in the picture. I am just done. My sister and I are all the family he has.\n\nSo I sat him down while my sister was at work and I showed him the paperwork for terminating their tenancy and then evicting them. I told him that if he caused me to have to deal with the police one more time or he was suspended again that I would file the paperwork and they would be evicted in 30 days. Since I know that they cannot afford to live in this city on what my sister earns it would mean moving somewhere else far away from his friends.\n\nI told him he had to decide for himself if he wanted to be homeless or in foster care. I drove him down to the homeless encampment and pointed out the complete lack of internet access and showers.\n\nHe was very quiet. When his mom got home he told her everything. My sister came to yell at me about being a controlling asshole. She said that I was not his parent and that I had no right to talk to him like that or to try and discipline him. I just gave her a copy of the paperwork and the relevant laws about evicting people. I also didn't go grocery shopping for them that week.\n\nI talked to them together and told them to come see me with their decision. That was three weeks ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago they came to see me. They said that they were sorry for their behavior and that they would not be causing me any more problems. I took them at their word and gave them groceries for a couple of days until I had time to go get them more.\n\nIt has been very quiet at the apartment and when I see them they are polite but they are keeping to themselves. My sister and I have spoken and she is still mad at me for what I did.

All of which is a long-winded way of saying bored or angry kids tend to react badly in the moment. If you can find any spare cash for therapy/counselling/sport etc, it might defuse things.

They are clearly mostly TA here.\n\nThat said, did you tell your sister you planned to give her son THIS wake-up call?  Did you go behind her back with this?  Not because the kid needs to be coddled, or because she's Mother of the Year here, but because that's a hell of a thing to put on someone else's kid.  It also could have backfired spectacularly if the mom got blindsided and instead protected her precious baby from mean old landlord-family.  \n\nI'm glad it's worked out well for you, but I guarantee you that in the long-term, your sister is wondering what she might find out after the fact next time, and what her son may be threatened with next time.

Either way, you could\u2019ve included your sister in the plan ahead of time and worked together rather than threaten her and her son with homelessness, which is so cold to do to your family. It\u2019s kind to buy groceries, but your sister should apply for assistance so she isn\u2019t relying on you.

Notice how once they apologized he so graciously allowed them food? That's sick. Yeah, something has to be done, but maybe something that involved both the sister and kid and a serious chat that could have been like the one he did with only the 13 yo.

And yes, giving him that support is not your job, but seems like no one else is giving him any either.

But in the end Zack just punched his mother and got the house all shot up after he stole from some dealer. My dad snapped and kicked him out (at 19), and he's banned from ever setting foot there again. He sacrificed too much of his life trying to give that kid a solid foundation.\n\nThat's what OP would have been heading for if he hadn't laid down the rules. Zack was already 14 by the time our families were joined, and had bad outside influences from his dad. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but either way you have to decide what you're willing to put up with and set hard boundaries.\n\n(\\*ETA: my dad and his mom weren't married, they were de facto.

It screams that sister is irresponsible and OP had to step up to make sure this kid is taken care of, IMO.  \n\nBut, be very careful OP, you are bordering on enabling your sister to continue being irresponsible.

Since you genuinely asked:\n\nAs a landlord, if a tenant gives you trouble you warn the tenant amd if it continues, you evict. Going around the tenant  by intimidating their child is absolutely disgusting imho. Probably illegal too. Being a landlord does not grant you parental rights. Neither does being an aunt. Neither does buying someone groceries. OP is absolutely an AH here.

And once they apologized he gave them some food! This is a bananas level of abuse by itself, then to threaten homelessness or foster care??

He\u2019s starting highschool which we all know is not a fun time for the majority of kids. He has no male role model/father figure for guidance. And how active is mum able to be with her work schedule as a solo parent? \nBy the sounds of it that poor boy is struggling!! \n\nInstead of looking at his behaviour in such a negative \u201cattention seeking\u201d light, maybe you could try look at it more like a kid calling out for help in the only way he knows how.\nPlease remember the human brain doesn\u2019t develop until 25+. Especially important is the frontal cortex which is last to develop.\nIt\u2019s responsible for managing higher level executive functions. Such as capacity to plan and organise, understanding full consequences of actions, problem solving, social behaviour. Initiate, self monitor and control ones response in order to achieve a goal.\n\nIt really does sound like this kids just need some decent guidance and a person to actually care about him. Not someone that holds their home and food over them when they don\u2019t like their behaviour \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut ultimately\u2026 yes I think YTA. \n1.

It doesn\u2019t matter that you own the property, if you had a problem with his behaviour the appropriate thing would have been to approach his mother as an adult.", "It was the controlling comment for me. If she thinks the very normal want of no cops at his house for a FOURTEEN year old is controlling she's probably not doing squat to parent the little monster.  She's the asshole.", "Smells like an addict to me tbh can't be trusted to get actual food with the money? Why what would she spend it on otherwise?", "Some children are better off without a father if the father is abusive.", "It doesn't sound like OP's sister doesn't love and support her son. OP too. And they have a roof over their head and food and utilities all paid for. *And* the kid doesn't have a bad outside influence in his dad, it's probably coming from his peers if anything. Also, we're not hearing about all the times OP tried to provide more gentle support, you're only hearing about when he snapped. I could write my dad's experience the same way. Zack stole, lied, cheated, drove drunk, crashed his car/s. He assaulted people. He was always being suspended, then expelled. The cops were there so many times. My dad had had enough and kicked him out. Those facts don't change all the good things he did and tried to do before that stage. \n\nZack was objectively worse off than OP's nephew. He was exposed to a much more turbulent life with his parents divorce and then his dad's unstable lifestyle and his mom's mental illness. Having a stable single-parent household is not the worst thing possible. He has some challenges there but it's absolutely something that can be managed, and will actually be easier to manage because it's easier to set a routine and consistent rules when you don't have to send your child to a drug addict's house every second week.\n\n\\* Is it the best start to life? No. But you can't change the past, you can only plan for the future, and a future where OP's nephew had a slightly shitty childhood is better than going into foster care or prison. Should his mom do better? Sure, but OP isn't his mom, he's his uncle.", "But this isn\u2019t a strict landlord/tenant relationship. If it were, it would be out of line to approach the teenager directly. But they are family, and OP is subsidizing their lifestyle. OP also didn\u2019t trust that going to the parent would be effective, as the parent would likely not pass the information on to the teenager.", "He said he buys their groceries, which implies that they can't otherwise afford them. Unless grocery stores are giving away free food, I'm assuming they didn't have food for  week.", "True. I know men like this guy and they suck. \"Tough love\" is a garbage mentality. How about, I don't know, having a real conversation with the kid? Treat him like you care about him and what's going on in his life.
