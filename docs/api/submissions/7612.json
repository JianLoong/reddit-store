I have no other way of making sure that they have a place over their heads and food to eat.\n\nLately my nephew has been acting up. He was suspended from school. He has been bringing friends to the apartment and making noise late into the night. I have had to deal with the cops a few times over his behavior. My sister can not or will not control him. His father is not in the picture. I am just done. My sister and I are all the family he has.\n\nSo I sat him down while my sister was at work and I showed him the paperwork for terminating their tenancy and then evicting them. I told him that if he caused me to have to deal with the police one more time or he was suspended again that I would file the paperwork and they would be evicted in 30 days. Since I know that they cannot afford to live in this city on what my sister earns it would mean moving somewhere else far away from his friends.\n\nI told him he had to decide for himself if he wanted to be homeless or in foster care. I drove him down to the homeless encampment and pointed out the complete lack of internet access and showers.\n\nHe was very quiet. When his mom got home he told her everything. My sister came to yell at me about being a controlling asshole. She said that I was not his parent and that I had no right to talk to him like that or to try and discipline him. I just gave her a copy of the paperwork and the relevant laws about evicting people. I also didn't go grocery shopping for them that week.\n\nI talked to them together and told them to come see me with their decision. That was three weeks ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago they came to see me. They said that they were sorry for their behavior and that they would not be causing me any more problems. I took them at their word and gave them groceries for a couple of days until I had time to go get them more.\n\nIt has been very quiet at the apartment and when I see them they are polite but they are keeping to themselves.

All of which is a long-winded way of saying bored or angry kids tend to react badly in the moment. If you can find any spare cash for therapy/counselling/sport etc, it might defuse things.

They are clearly mostly TA here.\n\nThat said, did you tell your sister you planned to give her son THIS wake-up call?  Did you go behind her back with this?  Not because the kid needs to be coddled, or because she's Mother of the Year here, but because that's a hell of a thing to put on someone else's kid.  It also could have backfired spectacularly if the mom got blindsided and instead protected her precious baby from mean old landlord-family.  \n\nI'm glad it's worked out well for you, but I guarantee you that in the long-term, your sister is wondering what she might find out after the fact next time, and what her son may be threatened with next time.  Nevermind that you did it from a place of love, at the end of your wits, after all of this help, she's going to be watching her back with you for a bit.", "This isn't really asking for any input, you're just wanting the internet to congratulate you.

YTA", "NTA for saying you have no problem with making them homeless. If you did however do that, my answer would be different\n\nI think tough love is needed sometimes, but it's very situational & doesn't work for everyone. Usually when kids/teens act out, they're not doing well mentally or emotionally. So maybe the reasons why he acts the way he does needs to be addressed\n\nHowever, I do think he needs to understand that you're trying to help. It is nice you're trying to help them, & single parenting can be different, so it's nice you tried to discipline him, however, I think you should have talked about it with your sister first, since she is the parent", "Unpopular opinion: YTA. \nYou couldn\u2019t talk to your sister ahead of time and get on the same page/ create a united front? Were you actually going to evict your sister bc her son is poorly behaved? Or was it just a threat to get him in line? Either way, you could\u2019ve included your sister in the plan ahead of time and worked together rather than threaten her and her son with homelessness, which is so cold to do to your family. It\u2019s kind to buy groceries, but your sister should apply for assistance so she isn\u2019t relying on you. It must be really stressful to know one wrong move from her or her son and they will be hungry or homeless. Kids mess up all the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yeah, something has to be done, but maybe something that involved both the sister and kid and a serious chat that could have been like the one he did with only the 13 yo.
