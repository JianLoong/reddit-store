I charge her rent every month but then I use the money to pay her utilities and buy their groceries. I have no other way of making sure that they have a place over their heads and food to eat.\n\nLately my nephew has been acting up. He was suspended from school. He has been bringing friends to the apartment and making noise late into the night. I have had to deal with the cops a few times over his behavior. My sister can not or will not control him. His father is not in the picture. I am just done. My sister and I are all the family he has.\n\nSo I sat him down while my sister was at work and I showed him the paperwork for terminating their tenancy and then evicting them. I told him that if he caused me to have to deal with the police one more time or he was suspended again that I would file the paperwork and they would be evicted in 30 days. Since I know that they cannot afford to live in this city on what my sister earns it would mean moving somewhere else far away from his friends.\n\nI told him he had to decide for himself if he wanted to be homeless or in foster care. I drove him down to the homeless encampment and pointed out the complete lack of internet access and showers.\n\nHe was very quiet. When his mom got home he told her everything. My sister came to yell at me about being a controlling asshole. She said that I was not his parent and that I had no right to talk to him like that or to try and discipline him. I just gave her a copy of the paperwork and the relevant laws about evicting people. I also didn't go grocery shopping for them that week.\n\nI talked to them together and told them to come see me with their decision. That was three weeks ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago they came to see me. They said that they were sorry for their behavior and that they would not be causing me any more problems. I took them at their word and gave them groceries for a couple of days until I had time to go get them more.\n\nIt has been very quiet at the apartment and when I see them they are polite but they are keeping to themselves. My sister and I have spoken and she is still mad at me for what I did.

All of which is a long-winded way of saying bored or angry kids tend to react badly in the moment. If you can find any spare cash for therapy/counselling/sport etc, it might defuse things.

They are clearly mostly TA here.\n\nThat said, did you tell your sister you planned to give her son THIS wake-up call?  Did you go behind her back with this?  Not because the kid needs to be coddled, or because she's Mother of the Year here, but because that's a hell of a thing to put on someone else's kid.  It also could have backfired spectacularly if the mom got blindsided and instead protected her precious baby from mean old landlord-family.  \n\nI'm glad it's worked out well for you, but I guarantee you that in the long-term, your sister is wondering what she might find out after the fact next time, and what her son may be threatened with next time.

Either way, you could\u2019ve included your sister in the plan ahead of time and worked together rather than threaten her and her son with homelessness, which is so cold to do to your family. It\u2019s kind to buy groceries, but your sister should apply for assistance so she isn\u2019t relying on you.

I can't imagine how awful his sister felt, the money is already gone and the person who has it is lording over you and essentially not allowing you to eat. Notice how once they apologized he so graciously allowed them food? That's sick. Yeah, something has to be done, but maybe something that involved both the sister and kid and a serious chat that could have been like the one he did with only the 13 yo.

Also, we're not hearing about all the times OP tried to provide more gentle support, you're only hearing about when he snapped. I could write my dad's experience the same way. Zack stole, lied, cheated, drove drunk, crashed his car/s. He assaulted people. He was always being suspended, then expelled. The cops were there so many times. My dad had had enough and kicked him out. Those facts don't change all the good things he did and tried to do before that stage. \n\nZack was objectively worse off than OP's nephew. He was exposed to a much more turbulent life with his parents divorce and then his dad's unstable lifestyle and his mom's mental illness. Having a stable single-parent household is not the worst thing possible.

No. But you can't change the past, you can only plan for the future, and a future where OP's nephew had a slightly shitty childhood is better than going into foster care or prison.

The child can know of the conversation but to have the conversation alone and put the expectations and responsibilities of an adult on him is too much in my opinion and won\u2019t lead to the outcome OP wants. You should deal with the parent and if his sister isn\u2019t doing a good job then you need to deal with her being a better parent.
