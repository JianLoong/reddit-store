I have no other way of making sure that they have a place over their heads and food to eat.\n\nLately my nephew has been acting up. He was suspended from school. He has been bringing friends to the apartment and making noise late into the night. I have had to deal with the cops a few times over his behavior. My sister can not or will not control him. His father is not in the picture. I am just done. My sister and I are all the family he has.\n\nSo I sat him down while my sister was at work and I showed him the paperwork for terminating their tenancy and then evicting them. I told him that if he caused me to have to deal with the police one more time or he was suspended again that I would file the paperwork and they would be evicted in 30 days. Since I know that they cannot afford to live in this city on what my sister earns it would mean moving somewhere else far away from his friends.\n\nI told him he had to decide for himself if he wanted to be homeless or in foster care. I drove him down to the homeless encampment and pointed out the complete lack of internet access and showers.\n\nHe was very quiet. When his mom got home he told her everything. My sister came to yell at me about being a controlling asshole. She said that I was not his parent and that I had no right to talk to him like that or to try and discipline him. I just gave her a copy of the paperwork and the relevant laws about evicting people. I also didn't go grocery shopping for them that week.\n\nI talked to them together and told them to come see me with their decision. That was three weeks ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago they came to see me. They said that they were sorry for their behavior and that they would not be causing me any more problems. I took them at their word and gave them groceries for a couple of days until I had time to go get them more.\n\nIt has been very quiet at the apartment and when I see them they are polite but they are keeping to themselves. My sister and I have spoken and she is still mad at me for what I did.

All of which is a long-winded way of saying bored or angry kids tend to react badly in the moment. If you can find any spare cash for therapy/counselling/sport etc, it might defuse things.

They are clearly mostly TA here.\n\nThat said, did you tell your sister you planned to give her son THIS wake-up call?  Did you go behind her back with this?  Not because the kid needs to be coddled, or because she's Mother of the Year here, but because that's a hell of a thing to put on someone else's kid.  It also could have backfired spectacularly if the mom got blindsided and instead protected her precious baby from mean old landlord-family.  \n\nI'm glad it's worked out well for you, but I guarantee you that in the long-term, your sister is wondering what she might find out after the fact next time, and what her son may be threatened with next time.

Either way, you could\u2019ve included your sister in the plan ahead of time and worked together rather than threaten her and her son with homelessness, which is so cold to do to your family. It\u2019s kind to buy groceries, but your sister should apply for assistance so she isn\u2019t relying on you.

Notice how once they apologized he so graciously allowed them food? That's sick. Yeah, something has to be done, but maybe something that involved both the sister and kid and a serious chat that could have been like the one he did with only the 13 yo.

NTA.\n\nIn the long run, your sister and nephew will see why you did it, and that's your trying to help him him out.", "Tough love was needed. I\u2019m sorry your sister is angry but I think she\u2019s just mad at herself for feeling helpless. It\u2019s also a reality check for her that you can evict her at anytime. She probably never thought you would and now that she knows it\u2019s possible, she\u2019s angry and most likely scared.", "I hope she takes it. You are actively hurting the kid and using him passively aggressively to communicate with his mom. It's legit abuse.", "NTA. I am glad they have you! After some time, when nephew continues to earn back your trust I hope you can rebuild your relationship so he knows what you did was from a place of love.", "YTA- you are not his parent. You should have explained the eviction threat to your sister. I\u2019d be pissed if I were her, too. You took an adult situation and brought it to the kid.", "YTA", "YTA, so a teenager is going to be made responsible for his mom's inability to house them? I understand you're frustrated but putting all of this weight on a child is cruel!\n\nYour ridiculous controlling behavior is truly horrendous! So you take the money for food and when you're upset you decide not to provide that food? You are NOT some hero in this situation, in fact I cannot even fathom the cruelty an adult would need to harbor in order to pull all this!", "NTA", "Yta. He's a kid. Making him untrusting of family who threatens to take his home is not helping him in any way. This kid will grow up thinking everyone is out to get him.\n\nFor your sister and her boys sakes, i hope they can find a new situation.", "YTA -- 14 is not an adult age. Evict them if you must, but you should have talked to just the mom and not the child. He clearly needs help... therapy? Maybe? I'm not a social worker but you made him uncomfortable in the home his mom pays for. If he was truly so bad, why didn't the cops arrest him and send him to juvi?", "NTA. So your not the parent and not responsible for disciplining him but she allows you to house them for free and buy them food and such. Your also the one having to answer to the police for his behavior and having to deal with his behavioral problems. No chance you set them both straight and were clear and concise what happens next is up to them. Be clear with her she\u2019s the parent so it\u2019s on her to get her kid under control.", "NTA. You stepped in when your sister failed. Good for you and I hope they continue to follow the rules.", "NTA.  Your sister was, for whatever reason, unable to create the necessary boundaries and limits around her son's behavior.   YOU then provided them.  You are not only saving her son (believe me, 14 year olds don't want to be in charge of bringing themselves up), but you're helping her.  If she can't see that now, it's too bad.   Your nephew will respect you.   \n\nAnd actually none of that even matters--YOU have the right to create boundaries and limits around YOURSELF and the people you provide room & board to.  \n\nThere is no part of this where you are TA.", "NTA Maybe they've now learned not to bite the hand that literally feeds them.", "R u always this controlling about everything and quick to throw family yta", "ESH I definitely get where you're coming from and your nephew absolutely needed that wakeup call, but cornering a 13 y/o and threatening both him and him mother with homelessness is a huge overstep. I would have been totally on-board if you'd had the conversation with your sister at the same time, if you'd sat them down and made it clear to BOTH of them that you won't tolerate his behaviour and that she needs to step up and act like a parent, that would have been fine.", "The comments on this are absolutely insane- \n\nThey live with you. Yes, you have the right to make the rules. And it's valid to tell an adult what's gonna happen if things don't change. HOWEVER, your nephew is 13 almost 14 fucking years old. Drop that shit on your sister, not a CHILD. The fact you did it while she was gone just shows you know it was shitty, what the fuck.\nAnd you didn't buy them food because of them being upset at this?? Fucking wild\n\nSo YTA for saying that to a child and not keeping it between the adults where it should have stayed", "NTA\n\nHarsh, but perhaps necessary. It doesn't seem like you did it out of malice, and I assume that you would have no issues with either of them and would house them as long as he's not causing any trouble, right? If so, then NTA.", "Sounds like something had to give. Maybe now they might realise they are lucky.\nNTA", "NTA. Tough love done right.", "Mta. You gave them some tough love.", "I\u2019m going to be generous and assume she\u2019s so tied up in trying to make her situation better she\u2019s had no time or energy to help her son where he needs it. Being upset at OP is dented pride at someone who shouldn\u2019t be the parent having to do the parent thing.", "Definitely NTA - So your sister can be mad at you, and tell you of your place in the family dynamic but can't tell her son? \n\nSo she can discipline you and establish boundaries, but can't with her son?", "I don't much like using actual human beings as object lessons. They're people, not parables. Teaching reasonable consequences for his actions, sure.

She did nothing.", "She can afford food.", "yes, she thought I was joking.", "I spoke with my sister a few times. She did nothing about it.", "Lmao, letting someone do their own grocery shopping is not withholding food.", "Fun fact I went from dealing with the cops two to three times a week to zero times in a month.", "I take money for RENT.", "A single mother unable to afford to keep the lights on and feed her son, relying on her sibling for that. Desperate times mean not everything that needs to be done can be done.", "I have offered her money to move to a cheaper city.", "Thus far because I have stepped in to help.", "It's not.", "You need to learn to read.", "How many times should I have to ask her to control her kid?  Should I just let the cops take the kid next time?", "That's the bit that gets me.  Sister is complaining that she's the AH, but also completely stepped into line, got her son to behave and the world is travelling along fine and they still have a house.  Sister is not just a bad mum, she's pretty clueless about the realities of life.", "Asba parent regardless of your situation you still have to parent and she is not. If she's living off of family generosity I'm not sure how she is better their situation.  Especially if ignoring her kids behavior. OP NTA good for you!", "Depending on how long his father has been out of the picture it could be linked to that, loss of a father figure and a mother too busy trying to make ends meet to meet his emotional needs.", "Yeah, nephew is the one causing all the issues and OP is his uncle.\n\nThese issues never would have arisen in the first place if sister was a good mum. Going to her would have solved nothing.", "Agreed. The food part REALLY bothered me too. It makes OP the asshole. Also, the child needs someone\u2019s time and love, especially if you are also trying to \u201ctough love.\u201d\nYTA", "I think most of us can admit to being some kind of pain in the ass at that age, but there's being an annoying 13 year and there's being the kind of misbehaving 13 year old who's had the police called on them multiple times. His behavior has gone well past not getting homework done and shirking the occasional chore.", "OP has talked to sister several times about disciplining her son she didn\u2019t take any action so someone had to. Having the cops called on a 13 almost 14 year old IS NOT NORMAL. OP did not withstand the food, they can afford it, he takes rent from them and uses that money to purchase them food that\u2019s very generous of OP most wouldn\u2019t even do that. \n\nThe kid needed a wake up call and know the decisions he\u2019s making right now will effect him in the long run.", "Did you communicate prior to the tough love to your sister that your nephew needed an intervention as to his behaviour, that the police had gotten involved numerous times? Did she says she\u2019d deal with it and not seem to follow through?", "Well if you're using that money to provide them food and then stop out of the blue in order to manipulate a child (and or his mom that still makes you an asshole. You should stop arguing about the food, you clearly see nothing wrong with using it as a manipulative tactic but as you're hopefully learning, most people find that disturbing.", "Then don\u2019t step in? You clearly don\u2019t care for the kid. I mean you held food over their heads, you mentioned in a comment before that you choose to be nice and buy them food, so don\u2019t anymore. Don\u2019t bother with it and evict them\u2026.", "I think that sister (mom) probably wouldn\u2019t have agreed with the methods used. Considering how she freaked out.", "After a bunch of people started calling op the AH, he says that they had food all along, they just had to buy it themselves. I think that he's full of it because why on earth would he have had to give them food from his own fridge for what he says himself were for the next couple of days until he went shopping next week? That sentence shows that they didn't have sufficient groceries until he gave them, there's no other reason it would be written that way", "I admire your solution and your style. Well done. NTA.", "It's not about owing them food. You obviously don't owe them food. It's the reason for stopping doing it that people have an issue with. You only stopped as punishment because the minor is misbehaving (he probably has a reason btw). If you don't want to give them food, just say that instead of using it as an excuse for punishment\n\nWhy do you even ask for people's opinion honestly if you don't even try to see their view & argue about it. & downvoting because you disagree is against the  subs rules", "From what you wrote you said that they pay you rent, which you use to cover their groceries and utilities, unless that means something other than what is literally there", "yes", "I do not owe them anything.

So clearly nta but I think the ppl who are saying yta are probably not moved out of there parents house yet. U had to call the cops consecutive times.
