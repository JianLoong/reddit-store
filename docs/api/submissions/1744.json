Learning how to spot the people who are using you is a life skill.", "That's fair but typically families care about what others struggle with. So if he is having issues you would like to think that a family would try to help instead of saying your issues your problems. Also, I understand that would suck for her as well and by no means am I saying this is her fault. All I wanted to do is point out there is an issue he is clearly struggling with so I do not think he is a jerk.", "I've never come across 'fappening', that I can recall.  I'm trying to remember whether it was used in 'Schitt's Creek'?   \n\n\nThese days, I'm lucky if I can remember my own name.", "Ah yeah I thought that might be it. I first heard that one back when like tons of women celebrities had their iClouds or something hacked and their nudes were spread everywhere. Since fapping is slang for\u2026well what creepy incels will do to stolen nudes\u2026it got morphed into \u201cthe fappening\u201d", "What a strange assumption to make.", "Holy shit, same but I didn't realize it until you mentioned it.", "Ah.  Thanks. I'm an older woman, so that probably explains why I've never come across the expression. Thank you for taking the time to explain - appreciated.", "NTA Wait, how did this affect him? Aren\u2019t costumes suppose to be funny\u2026. Does your whole family lack a sense of humor? How is this about him??", "NTA, he\u2019s about to be a grown as man embarrassed about what someone else is wearing.", "This would be strange (but at least understandable) if he was 8 and you were 11. \n\nAt 18 / 21 he should have enough self-confidence to be happy with who he is and happy that you are who you are. Sounds like you have a great sense of humor, sounds like maybe he needs to work on himself!", "NTA you're not bothered by it so", "NTA. Your brother is though. Why on earth would he think he has veto power here?  He's obviously still an immature child.. I would be loud and clear about this with him and the rest of the family.", "NTA at all but his reasoning makes it sound like he\u2019s just upset at comments people might be making about you to him, I think you should talk to him and see if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on and try to explain that he should be upset with people making comments, not you.", "NTA\n\nI would think that's hilarious. Its so weird that your brother is taking this stance,", "NTA. Why is this *any* of your brother's concern? Sounds like he needs to pull his head out of high school.", "NTA. Are you sure your brother is 18 and not 8?", "NTA\nYou have a prominent feature you and your friends both acknowledge and appreciate.\nYour little bro doesn't get to police how you \"should\" feel, nor make you responsible for his feelings about your shamelessness. If his actual problem is other people talking disrespectfully about you, he should be confronting them, not suppressing you.", "How the turns have tabled. As the youngest sibling it has been my mission to embarrass my older siblings because  of all the embarrassment they gave me growing up. Ngl I am pretty good at it. Low-key had my brother die inside last week. Was a good week.", "And if your family is conservative, like mine, then I can see them taking issue with it, but your brother... unless he's a conservative clone of your parents, then I don't know what his problem is.", "Omg lol, he\u2019s a sweet kid just insecure", "Love this.  My best example of this is at work.  I was talking quietly to a coworker at her cubicle (professional high preforming non-rep group).  Her boss (nosey and always wants the tea but never spill) walks over and says \"What are you talking about?\"  I tried to put him off a few times with \"Just  stuff\" or \"Nothing interesting\" but he would not let it go.  Heads were popping up and others were paying attention. Finally I said \"I was thanking her for giving me a tampon.\"\n\nNow, when I tell him \"Nothing you would be interested in\" or \"Just chatting\", he lets it go.\n\nTampons.  Always the nuclear option.\n\nAlso, NTA - well done from one older sister to another.", "I\u2019m surprised he isn\u2019t joining in on calling Dumptruck Dani!  Most siblings tease the heck out of each other!  My older brother would call me a cow one minute and then say I had chicken legs the next minute.", "Not going make him talk you any sooner.", "Do you really think people are going up to him all the time literally saying they want to have sex with the sister, or do you think they would\u2019ve said they liked her costume or that it was funny?? Most people will do the latter.", "You give people a lot of credit don\u2019t you ? Why don\u2019t you think they do both ?", "Loving the innocence of this thread, too cute. Congrats on your pregnancy, hope it's going well for you!", "People are a lot less likely to talk somebody about wanting to have sex with their sibling than just saying something normal. But let\u2019s say they are doing both. Then the brother needs to tell her that the problem is are sexually harassing OP, not that she is embarrassing him. Either way, OP being sexually harassed is not her fault and not something she needs to apologize for. That is the fault of whoever is making those comments.", "Alternative phrases would be \"panties in a wad\" and (for our UK friends) \"knickers in a twist\".", "Trying to control someone else and make them feel bad for their appearance makes you a jerk.  Just because we have feelings, that doesn't make our feelings valid or worthy of being acted upon.  Sometimes it just means we need therapy."]}
