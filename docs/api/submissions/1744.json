You're both young adults now. I know how aggravating it can be, hearing your peers make lewd comments about your sister, oftentimes to your face.

Half of it she wasn't even there anymore, but the BS remained.\n\nHe probably just got done dealing with that in HS, he's 18 and brand new to college and the world, and he's likely just known as being \"your brother\", again, before getting a chance to become his own person - again.\n\nYou don't have to deal with that, but he does - or he wouldn't have given an ultimatum. All most of us have in this world is our word and our actions. You completely disregarded his without even a warning or effort of compromise. You still could've found a costume that made you look good but wouldn't embarrass him as much, because it's not just embarrassment - it's more than that.\n\nHypothetical: What happens if one of his peers says something straight up vulgar about you to his face regarding your costume, and he gets in a fight. Could get hurt or suspended from school: for defending YOU. Would the costume still have been worth it?\n\nYour a chick that went through HS and now some college.
