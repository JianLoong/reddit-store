Mom needs to let go. Don't explain yourself anymore. Just book a hotel at a different place and leave quietly. Do not let her tag along. That's cringe on a whole other level.", "NTA\n\nBook a room elsewhere. Don\u2019t tell her. Don\u2019t let her in the car.\n\nDad\u2019s wrong, BTW. You don\u2019t need to be gentle with someone who makes arrangements to attend your couples\u2019 holiday.", "Wow at first I wondered if you were a minor from how she is acting but to read that you are an adult, even if you are a young one, NTA at all. She\u2019s way out of line.", "NTA - change your reservations and your departure time.  Leave without telling her in advance.", "Info - why does your mom think you wont survive? This is clearly very odd behavior so is there some more context?", "NTA. That\u2019s crazy. You seriously need to change hotel or even destination because she\u2019ll sabotage it otherwise. Also don\u2019t use life 360 or some other nanny tracker because she\u2019ll use that too. If you\u2019re all on the same cellphone plan, you can be tracked that way too. Bigger picture, you need a plan to get out on your own. This type of clinging and controlling behavior is not normal (albeit way too often seen in the era of helicopter parenting). Something bigger is at issue here, but if she won\u2019t listen to reason, you need to break off or consider going low contact. Good luck.", "NTA. And now you need to alter your plans without telling her. You learned from your rookie mistake, lol, and now is the time to change a few of the details. You should book a different hotel. Perhaps you can be gone and out of touch for a few days before you leave, or leave a day earlier than she thinks you will. You need to go briefly very low contact with her. You can call her once you're gone and let her know you're OK, and as often as you want totalk to her. But don't feel any pressure to. You are an adult and you've been looking forward to this and you deserve a fun and romantic vacation. Without your mother.", "NTA. She needs to let you be an adult.", "NTA. Your mom is acting kinda nuts. Book a different hotel.", "Mom needs therapy. Her happening to be in your hotel when you arrive does nothing to increase your physical safety; this is obviously about her resistance to letting you cut the umbilical cord.", "NTA.  Tell her she isn't coming with you.  Change your plans.  Let her get to the hotel alone.  And find out you are not there.", "NTA.  You are still living under her roof and rules.  While you may be an adult, you haven\u2019t forced her to really accept it by moving into your own space.   Not making an excuse for her because that was twisted.  Stand firm on this though.", "Nta, she's not controlling,  she's got issues.", "NTA, either find a different hotel or actively avoid her. Don\u2019t talk to or acknowledge her on your trip", "Reschedule the trip and don't tell her. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThese type of parents will suffocate you as long as you let them.

At some point you have to live your life, you can\u2019t be scared of everything or you won\u2019t be able to grow.", "Over protective Mom here.  NTA.   I can understand you are upset.  That is fully justified. \n\nPlease take a deep breath and try talking calmly to your mother.  Remind her that you are an adult, and that she helped raise you to be safety conscious.  Assure her that you will call or text every day (and even use a password -- i.e., every text will include the word scenic) --but you are entitled to your independence.  You are not doing this to frighten her, but she needs to trust that she raised you with coping skills and situational awareness.  \n\nNeither of you will grow into a full ADULT mother-grown child relationship until you spread your wings accepting responsibility for your decisions and choices, and she accepts letting you make decisions and the occasional mistake.\n\nTake care and have fun.", "NTA for blowing up. Your mom was inappropriate. But it\u2019s your fault you  keep living with them as a \u201etax paying adult\u201c. That invites overbearing moms to act like this", "INFO: how old are you? Why do you say you're \"tax paying adult\" yet still live with her/your parents?", "How old are you, OP? \n\nDo you live with your parents, are they supporting you?", "NTA\n\nBut if you're feeling mean, take her with you on the drive there. Then lock her out of your room and don't answer.

You know what couples do on romantic vacations, right??? If you have some kink, leave us out of it.\" You know, something to really make her skin crawl \ud83d\ude09", "Cancel her room for her, don't tell her.  Tell her you aren't going and you hope she's happy! Stay at your boyfriend's the night before you are supposed to leave ( calling the hotel telling them if anyone tries to cancel your reservations not to let them) and leave from there. \nLeave a day early. So easy peasy.", "NTA.  She is not concerned about you, she is trying to control you.  Don't let her.  Setup hard boundaries and don't let her cross them ever.", "NTA and please book a hotel somewhere else and for the love of dog, don\u2019t let her come in the car with you.", "Ewww. Why does she even want to go.  That's just wierd.", "Your mother is very controlling. NTA.", "Just info: how old are u and your bf? Bc I could maybe understand if u are both 18 and maybe tell you to have a sit down convo with everyone including your dad, after you cancel her hotel, and maybe when u come back some counseling for both of you so it doesn't scalate when you are older. But if you are older you also need to get your own place, since u look like u have financial independence, and this would be for both of your mental peace.", "NTA but it would be super ironic if you died on holiday.  Please update us after to let us know you're ok.  :)", "I have never driven that long before and she\u2019s convinced that I can\u2019t do it. Even though I\u2019ll be driving in shifts.", "I\u2019m attending college right now and my mom doesn\u2019t want me to move out.

I am leaving in a few months against her wishes due to some factors I\u2019m not comfortable posting.", "Nah, even at 18 they have a right to go on a trip and not expect uninvited parents. Otherwise responsible teenagers should be able to travel somewhere without a parent.", "I\u2019ll make sure I don\u2019t get murdered", "NTA - good luck, but its time for your mom to back off.", "She doesn\u2019t get to cripple you because she doesn\u2019t want to be an empty nester. Move out already.", "She can\u2019t stop you. It\u2018s not up to her. You do not need her permission.\n\nMaybe consider postponing the trip until after you\u2019ve moved out. It\u2019s a lot easier to have autonomy without someone literally looking over your shoulder whenever you\u2019re home.\n\nBtw I love road trips and driving, primarily because being in the car was the one place where I had absolute freedom. My recommendation is to stop every 100 miles to stretch your legs/pee/get the blood pumping. You\u2019ll be much less tired that way. And if you feel sleepy at all, that\u2019s when you pull over and switch drivers and/or take a little nap. Don\u2019t drive when you're sleepy. And top off your gas tank when you get below half a tank, if you can combine it with a stretch/pee stop. The only reason I say that is because I\u2019ve had a couple nailbiters where I was out in the middle of nowhere, trying to find a gas station while the car was on fumes.\n\nIf you follow those 3 rules, your road trip will be a blast.", "It\u2019s just that if you are dependent on your parents-financially or for college or for someplace to live- it might be better- for your own good- to (and I hate to have l to say this!)- submit. Do they don\u2019t cut you off. \n\nThey sound controlling. Controlling parents pull stunts like that.\n\nBut if you are an independent adult? Change those reservations. Hell, get reservations in the next town over. You don\u2019t want your mama interrupting your vacation.", "Of course they should, but it would make a little more sense and yes sometimes we have to talk to our parents, and have the convo of I'm not a teen anymore. Even if you were LEGALLY obligated to take care of me last month and for the last 18 years, now u can relax. And also, talk about concerns not everything needs to be a fight or put under the rug or passive agresive, I'm a firm beliver in talking things out. But more so if you are just 18, bc AGAIN you are just becoming an adult and your parent is just becoming not responsable of you."]}
