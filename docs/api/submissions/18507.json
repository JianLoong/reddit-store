And if you feel sleepy at all, that\u2019s when you pull over and switch drivers and/or take a little nap. Don\u2019t drive when you're sleepy. And top off your gas tank when you get below half a tank, if you can combine it with a stretch/pee stop.

Turn off your phone.  When you check in at the hotel, ask them to note on the registration that absolutely NO ONE is to be given your room number.

It\u2019s tough but my relationship with my mother is much better \nOf course parents should support their kids, no questions asked. But that\u2019s in a perfect world. after all they\u2019re human, so they have flaws and are sometimes AH like mom here. Being an adult means taking responsibility. I rather push myself than complaining that life isn\u2019t fair like a child", "I have the same question.", "In the OP she says she's an adult, but even if she's 18 and fresh out of high school, this seems like a bit much.", "Once I was trying to get to the lone service station in this rural English town and the DAMNED ONE WAY SYSTEM really took it all up a notch. So close and yet so far!!", "NTA", "NTA...your mom and dad are both stepping over boundaries. Your mom's behaviour is NOT normal! They both need to see that and act accordingly.", "BAHAHAHA that's terrible!", "NTA\n\nThough you may want to change the date/destination or at the very least, the hotel. Just give that info to a trusted friend.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re not on any \u2018find my phone\u2019 family apps with your parents. \n\nAnd check in with a daily text. That should be more than enough.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop sharing information about your life with your mom. She has shown you over and over again that she can\u2019t be trusted with it.", "NTA - this is overbearing and honestly quite disrespectful of her. I get she worries but what\u2019s wrong with a call or text here and there? Not all the time like but wow you need a break and a life to yourself", "Are you my long lost sister? Because my mother does this exact sort of crazy shit, and I can tell you it does not get better unless you put your foot down HARD. Example: my mother was utterly convinced I would not survive a trip to Bali and would be \"blown up by terrorists.\" Thinking to reassure her, I made the mistake of texting her from the airport to say we would message her to when we had arrived safely at the resort. She immediately went crazy and phoned a friend of hers who she knew had a son who worked at the airport newsagency, demanded his number (\"It's an EMERGENCY!!\") and phoned him begging him to get over to the departure lounge and stop us boarding! Your mother will be pulling precisely this sort of utterly insane stunt unless you put her on a complete information diet. Tell her nothing. She will scream and cry about being \"shut out\" but it's the only way I've been able to keep my sanity with her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChange your reservation, but dont tell her. And just leave.", "NTA - I would call and cancel your mother's reservation", "Agree and let her take care of her own transportation. Do not take her with you.\n\n Leave with your bf in the car without your mother - go stay at the bf s house the night before. \n\nIgnore her when you are there if you  don't/can't change hotels and go on trips without saying anything other than good day and goodbye.\n\nNTA", "\"Yes, I *did* make a reservation for that room\" (that I then canceled)", " NTA.\n\nTell her you\u2019re going to have wild sex half of the trip, even stop to go at it in the car on the way. I\u2019m sure that would change her mind.\n\nBut seriously, what she\u2019s doing is not okay. She has no right to invite herself to come with you guys, especially without asking. You\u2019re an adult, doesn\u2019t matter that you live with her. She can be worried and that\u2019s okay, but she needs to let you live your life and make your mistakes in the future. I think it\u2019s good that you were harsh, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have listened at all. If that hurt her feelings, she should take a long look in the mirror. This situation is not your fault in any way, so try not to feel bad about it.", "What your mom did is so utterly unacceptable that I can see why you'd fly off the handle.  She's not \"just worried about you.\"  Following you on your romantic getaway would be intrusive, inappropriate, infantilizing, and reflects a real problem with boundaries.\n\nAssuming refundable, you might want to book into different hotels and slightly change your schedule without sharing the specific info with her, as it's entirely possible that even with your firm limit-setting, she'll still show up down the hall of your lodgings.\n\nNTA", "Perfect time to set hard boundaries or she\u2019ll never let go.", "NTA\n\nYou need to move out of there...", "I wonder if the parents see red flags op is ignoring?", "From some of your other posts I think your mom has a point of not allowing g you to go alone. NAH.", "Different hotel, in a different city!", "There\u2019s an entire subreddit devoted to this. /r/helicopterparents", "Nope, Canadian. good to know the insanity crosses cultures.", "It has to happen some time. Does she expect you to live at home until she dies?!"]}
