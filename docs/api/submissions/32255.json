I live nearby, but most of the family doesn\u2019t and the other family members that are nearby all have kids and understandably like to spend most of their time with their families.

I was mystified that your family would treat you like this, until you got to the part where you explained that they don't want to hire professional caregivers for her because it would use up their \"inheritance.\" Now you know the real reason they keep demanding you do care for her, why they tell you that your pain results from your lack of faith, etc. These are all just part of the big picture where they want to maximize their inheritance. \n\nThe thing about an inheritance is that it's the money left over AFTER the owner is done with it. Your grandmother's savings, income, and assets, while she's still alive, belong to your grandmother. And should be used for HER benefit.\n\nAs things now stand, your health, wellbeing, and your future earning potential are being used by your family to avoid paying for her care. Essentially, they are taking from you to give to themselves, by demanding you do this care instead of hiring a paid professional to do it.\n\nIf you step back and start looking after yourself and your future, then either another relative will have to fill in to provide care (and once they feel how burdensome it is, they will rapidly be meeting with the other family members to find a more equitable solution), or they'll have to use your grandmother's assets to buy care.", "NTA\n\nCaregivers are notoriously burnt out quickly! Her dementia is only going to get worse, never better. She needs help and if she's being neglected, then Adult Protective Services (or whatever you have where you live) can be called on the family. \n\nCall your City Hall for help with finding a Social Worker to talk to her family. Your grandma could fall, hurt herself, cause a fire or flood, the list goes on.", "NTA\n\nYou have neither the time, the physical ability, the training nor the desire to become a caregiver. She has others to provide or pay for her care.", "Gotta love people who think that all medical issues can be cured by faith - that takes a special kind of stupidity. And then the added bonus that they're greedy and unfeeling towards your grandmother.\n\nNTA, of course. You have every right to refuse to be your grandmother's caregiver. If you can, you might want to continue visiting her, just to make sure that she is getting proper care. If she isn't, you could contact whatever Adult Protective Services agency there is in your area, to make sure that someone in authority is aware of the potential risks to her health.", "NTA.  My MIL has dementia and while she's ok for now, she's getting to the point where she'll soon need a full-time caregiver in a memory care facility.  Not only do you not have the time to deal with your grandmother, you don't have the resources or skills to do it, and your grandmother's home may not even be safe for her to live in any more.\n\nThere is a Reddit sub - r/dementia - where people who have dealt with these kinds of issues may have some advice for your particular situation, or resources you could contact for help getting your grandmother placed.", "NTA just because you\u2019re childless doesnt make u responsible for ur gma. they dont get a pass just because they have kids. Ur life is important, too", "NTA.  Your plate is overloaded as it is, and her care is not your responsibility.  It sounds like her kids are trying to avoid spending her money on her care so they'll get more when she dies.  This may be financial abuse and exploitation.  If they don't step up and provide skilled care for her, call adult protective services.", "NTA. You aren't refusing, you simply aren't able to.\n\nJust because you don't have a spouse or children, doesn't make your choices or your health less important than theirs. \n\nYour family has two options: they can care for her, or they can put her in a nursing home. None of those options are forcing/manipulating/guilting you into caring for her.\n\nI'm sorry things are tough. I'm sorry your grandma has dementia. I'm sorry that your family think they have the right to impose on you, that you are less important than they are. They are wrong.", "NTA. It is not an asshole move to put someone who has dementia / Alzheimers into a memory care place (not a regular nursing home) when needed. It keeps them safe, and they will be taken care of by people trained to deal with this medical condition, as opposed to the family and having the person they know drift away while still looking the same in front of them. Your grandmother needs actual care (depending on advanced she is), whether a home health aide, an alzheimer's adult day care center, a memory care center. Religion has nothing to do with your health condition or your grandmothers. You cannot pray the dementia away.", "NTA and you already know you're not dealing with rational people here.\n\nRational people don't blame the sick for being sick, or tell them they're sick because they lack faith. The only people who do that are one sandwich short of a picnic.", "NTA. Tell them if they have enough faith, Christ will make sure she's okay.", "NTA\nFuck her family how horrible. You can\u2019t take on all of this on your own and you shouldn\u2019t be required to while they talk down on you. Bad people don\u2019t take care of their parents try to put it off on someone else and over money won\u2019t get her good care. How is any of that Christian like ?? I think you\u2019ve been doing too much for them and now they are taking advantage of you. Find resource on what to do on this situation so she\u2019s guaranteed to be cared for.  Just keep busting her without telling them so you can check on her.", "NTA . She needs a memory care facility.  \n\nSadly, it sounds like they want to set it up, so she dies quicker. Which is disgusting and makes me wish karma slaps them like a wet fish.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of them has made it clear that as soon as she passes away they will inherit the house, clean it out, and rent it as soon as possible to increase their income. All of the siblings also dislike my dad because he\u2019s not as religious as them, so they have cut him out of everything. He and my siblings and I won\u2019t inherit anything, but the rest of the siblings and my cousins will.\n\nETA: my grandpa built the house all on his own as a wedding gift to my grandma. We have celebrated every holiday and special occasions in that house for seventy years. All of the furniture was handmade by my grandma\u2019s father as a wedding gift and she has taken excellent care of them. When she passes away they will all be sold and added to the inheritance sum. I grew up a block away and spent more time at that house than all of my cousins combined. I helped her in her garden and orchard and she taught me how to cook and sew. Knowing they are going to make the house unrecognizable and inaccessible is almost as painful as watching how she\u2019s been treated right now.", "Thank you for the additional resources! Her home is not safe for her anymore. She doesn\u2019t get out of bed on her own anymore. She falls frequently and she forgets her walker and overestimates how far she is actually capable of walking now. There have been a couple of times where she has tried to cook and forgot that the stove was on. She can\u2019t change her clothes and can\u2019t remember to change the disposable underwear they got for her. And the majority of the other people who do come to help her refuse to help her change it or clean her up. I worry about her health and safety. The family insists on having someone with her at all times when she\u2019s awake, but refuses to pay for proper care.", "From OP's posts, it sounds like they're just greedy AHS who want her to die faster so they can get their inheritance.", "I wish there was a way you could tell her about all of this with her understanding it so she might make a different decision. They are horrible people.", "Ungrateful,  selfish people to do that to her."]}
