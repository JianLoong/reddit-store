We are pretty much inseparable in EVERY aspect, except for when it comes to academic dedication and career planning/development.\r  \n\r  \nI grew up poor. So my only goal growing up was to have a financial security. This naturally lead to me always being hungry for academic achievements. My fianc\u00e9's family did not have any financial troubles. She was always a party-goer, so she never wanted to utilize her potential. She always said that \"your whole life is not about studying, you should have fun while you're young\". And I really try to match up that life-style. We'd spend days doing stuff together, doing whatever she felt like doing. This, as exhaustive as it was (I was running on <4h of sleep), kept her happy, and I was having fun with her, so I didn't mind.\r  \n\r  \nThere'd come a time where I'd decline going out or doing stuff for prolonged amounts of time (usually while crushing deadlines were quickly approaching and I was becoming overwhelmed), and she'd get irritated. I even tried to arrange study dates, but that failed miserably, because she'd always do the bare minimum and then move on (which was considerably faster than what I was able to do). This became an every-day reason to fight.\r  \n\r  \nI've completed all my degrees (including masters) with the highest distinction, have landed a high-paying job and I mainly work from home. You can say that I achieved my goal, and it took a lot of crying to get here, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. She, on the other hand, never got accepted for masters, graduated late, did not get to work in her own field, and struggles to make ends meet on her own to cover her own half of the bills. I've been trying to be comforting, offer her solutions, and reassure her that I don't mind covering up for us, because I truly love her and I know she'd do the same for me. For the past couple of weeks, she has been blaming everyone for the impasse she has hit. Her teachers for her bad grades, employers for requiring prior relevant work experience (which she has none), her friends for tempting her to go out, her parents for not giving her their will/sustaining her (they are both like mid-50s), and me for not pressuring her to study enough. I usually shrug it off, understand that she is just frustrated and disappointed, and try to be a good boyfriend for her. Lately, she is also nagging me for not spending time with her (we spend everyday afternoon together after my shift).\r  \n\r  \nSo, In the culmination of a series of intense discussions, I told her that she is the sole person responsible for her current situation, and that she wasted her potential and ultimately rendered herself below average, now facing the consequences.

She hasn\u2019t wasted her potential, she just hasn\u2019t tapped into it. That was a huge AH thing to say to her. Just because she didn\u2019t work her way up the academic ladder in her 20s does NOT mean she still can\u2019t do that. And if she doesn\u2019t want to? So what? Academic success isn\u2019t the only type of success out there and not everyone wants that. I can tell that you two are in different stages in life and value different things.

Luckily, he never called me \u201cbelow average\u201d directly, but it was inferred constantly. I was upset when that relationship ended but ultimately it was for the better.

I\u2019m not saying you two need to break up, but not every relationship is meant to last and if you have differing values that are resulting in this then maybe trying to force it isn\u2019t going to fix anything. Ultimately, she is in charge of her own destiny, and she needs to realize that, but you also need to realize that someone not going through the same academic track as you doesn\u2019t make them below average and lesser. You both need a shift in perspective, in my opinion.", "Oh boy.\n\nLet's break this down a bit.\n\nFirst of all, while it's possible that this boils down to *nothing* other than her poor choices, it's also possible that there's something else going on, or several something elses, that made it more difficult for her to make good choices. I'm not saying that this *is* the case, only that there's a chance it *might be* the case.\n\nFor example, for one pretty common scenario, let's picture a person who spent their earlier years of education effortlessly grasping most subjects almost before they were taught in school and being praised for their intelligence. This person never learned how to study because they never *had to* study, and never learned how to ask for help, and basically never learned how to fail. \n\nAnd then sooner or later they hit the wall, because *everybody* hits the wall, and now they are failing classes big time. Which is a problem, because their entire self-image is wrapped up with this idea of being effortlessly smart, and also because they have no idea how to fix this. They know in general principle \"study!\" but... they have no idea how to do that. And they're deeply ashamed. \n\nThe smart and sensible thing to do would be to ask the professor for help, google study tips, and learn to learn - but it's *very common* for people in this hole to basically do what she did - party hard, so that when they take a test and fail they can then say \"Oh, well, I failed because I was so hungover, lol!\" rather than \"I failed because I'm too stupid to manage a simple test, I'm a loser, I'm the worst\".\n\nAnd if you add in a single hidden learning disability such as ADHD, this behavior is even worse.\n\n*Is* this what's going on with her? I have no freaking clue! Do you need to be deeply sympathetic to her current whining about it even if this is some psychology stuff? Yeah, probably not, it all sounds really annoying. I'm only saying that it is *possible* that rather than simply making bad choices because she had no foresight she was in a situation where it was hard for her to make good choices.\n\nSecondly, I would normally advise anybody to think very carefully before marrying their high school sweetheart. Can it work out? Sure! But a lot of times two people who were really close in high school grow up into two very different people in adulthood. You're older than most people I have reason to give that advice to... but this fundamental disagreement is pretty big and might cause a lot of friction in a marriage. I really recommend that you two get some couples counseling before marriage. \n\nThird - your girlfriend is not \"below average\". She may not have a master's or a good job, but she has a bachelor's and lots of people don't have that. And she hasn't wasted anything. She's not even thirty. Lots of people go to college after that age and start new careers. I agree she'll have to develop some serious new habits and take some responsibility if she's going to do that, but ffs.\n\nWith that said, you're still NTA for what you said. I don't think many people would've reacted well to all this complaining. I think your actual facts are wrong with regards to her \"potential\", but that doesn't mean you were wrong to say it.", "ESH. Dude you're both 29 why are you acting like you're at the pinnical of your career?  Don't admonish your own experiences and success but don't rub them in her face like they make you better than her.  She's right it's not a race. But also yeah she could have worked harder. You can always say you could have worked harder. Just help her get achieve her goals and relax on the idea of \"crushing deadlines\". There's literally no such thing. Deadlines are made up by people for people to control people. Comparison is the thief of joy. You wanted something and you got it, she wanted something else and you got it, and now you're reconsiling the differences it created in your relationship and it shouldn't be a big deal.", "Nta what degree did u have", "NTA, mostly.  Part of what you said was true and appropriate tough love.  You waited too long to say it snd were frustrated so you went too far.  It is not too late for her.

Many people regret their masters because it makes them too overqualified in today\u2019s market.\n\nAnd she shouldn\u2019t have to, she should be able to pay all of her bills with a bachelor\u2019s degree. She should be allowed to be an average person that gets Bs or Cs in school and party sometimes. The job market right now is horrendous, no one is respecting degrees, hiring is tight, and pay is low. She may have been better off if she made all the \u201cright\u201d choices, but I think it\u2019s important to recognize the current economy and how shit it is.\n\nLastly, it sounds like you do 50/50 split with bills. I would suggest doing a % approach, I\u2019ve found that it helps make sure our bills are payed based on our income % and each person still has money to save or have fun with.

I don't really care if we are not \"on the same level academically\", this is completely irrelevant to me, she can do her own thing, I can do my own, I really really don't mind that. As I've also mentioned, I don't even care about the pay-gap, I'm more than happy to make our ends meet, this is not about money or her being lesser in any way. Never considered her inadequate in any sort of way.\n\nMy referral to her past habits were just context to what precedented the prior events to her dead-end. I did not add any comment on those, because I have none. Those were just there to summarize the general idea of her not being interested in advancing her academics earlier on, and now that she wanted to advance her career, she has been met with a wall that she thinks I built. Her \"wasted potential\" was, again, for the time-period during college, cause she is a natural problem solver, and highly intelligent, so college honestly would've been a breeze for her, because I've seen how brilliant she is when she puts effort into something.\n\nP.S. Again, I'm not saying the above to defend myself, I've read all the comments and they all have been helpful in their own way. I'm just hoping to give clearer context in terms that I do not wish to demean her through this post, and I do not look down on her in the general outlook of our lives together. Mods, if this comment is inappropriate, I'm sorry, delete if needed.", "Computer science, masters in data science", "No, no. Our respective bachelors both required 4 years (minimum) to complete. If you didn't pass a class or didn't sit the exam at all, you have the option to take the examination for a class on September, each year. This lead her to graduate in 6 years, so she was around 24 when she graduated. She then took a gap year, and now she has been trying to get accepted for a paid internship or a masters degree ever since, but we had no such luck unfortunately. She has been working in another (irrelevant) field in the between, to help me make ends meet.\n\nEdit: forgot a word", "It is totally possible.
