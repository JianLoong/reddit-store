We are pretty much inseparable in EVERY aspect, except for when it comes to academic dedication and career planning/development.\r  \n\r  \nI grew up poor. So my only goal growing up was to have a financial security. This naturally lead to me always being hungry for academic achievements. My fianc\u00e9's family did not have any financial troubles. She was always a party-goer, so she never wanted to utilize her potential. She always said that \"your whole life is not about studying, you should have fun while you're young\". And I really try to match up that life-style. We'd spend days doing stuff together, doing whatever she felt like doing. This, as exhaustive as it was (I was running on <4h of sleep), kept her happy, and I was having fun with her, so I didn't mind.\r  \n\r  \nThere'd come a time where I'd decline going out or doing stuff for prolonged amounts of time (usually while crushing deadlines were quickly approaching and I was becoming overwhelmed), and she'd get irritated. I even tried to arrange study dates, but that failed miserably, because she'd always do the bare minimum and then move on (which was considerably faster than what I was able to do). This became an every-day reason to fight.\r  \n\r  \nI've completed all my degrees (including masters) with the highest distinction, have landed a high-paying job and I mainly work from home. You can say that I achieved my goal, and it took a lot of crying to get here, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. She, on the other hand, never got accepted for masters, graduated late, did not get to work in her own field, and struggles to make ends meet on her own to cover her own half of the bills. I've been trying to be comforting, offer her solutions, and reassure her that I don't mind covering up for us, because I truly love her and I know she'd do the same for me. For the past couple of weeks, she has been blaming everyone for the impasse she has hit. Her teachers for her bad grades, employers for requiring prior relevant work experience (which she has none), her friends for tempting her to go out, her parents for not giving her their will/sustaining her (they are both like mid-50s), and me for not pressuring her to study enough. I usually shrug it off, understand that she is just frustrated and disappointed, and try to be a good boyfriend for her. Lately, she is also nagging me for not spending time with her (we spend everyday afternoon together after my shift).\r  \n\r  \nSo, In the culmination of a series of intense discussions, I told her that she is the sole person responsible for her current situation, and that she wasted her potential and ultimately rendered herself below average, now facing the consequences.

Then I started community college when I was 27, so my kid could be in the free daycare program they offered. I finished my AA when I was 29, my BA when I was 34, and my MA when I was 42 (after my kid graduated high school). I worked part time and studied hard the whole time, and I found a career I loved.

Yeah, sure.

You can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink, what were you supposed to grab her by the ponytail and lock her in the nearest library?

That's...really not fair or healthy. \n\nI think you've been fairly compassionate with her for the last fifteen years, it's only now that she's seeing the reprocussions of her actions and lashing out at others, it makes sense that you would not be as compassionate now. It was one thing for her not to work as hard as she could, is another thing entirely to act entitled to success and then get upset and angry at everyone around her when she didn't achieve it. She wanted a work life balance but cleary swung way too much in the opposite direction and is paying for it now.\n\nI'd say try and be compassionate with her now, but make a point to put up boundaries and make her aware that it's unreasonable to expect people to use their energy and time to push someone up a hill of their own making. Especially if they fight you the whole way. You're not Sisyphus, my guy, don't let her lack of motivation become your rock. She has to find that motivation within herself, it's not fair to expect you to pull both of your weight.\n\nI think it might be a good idea  to look at what else she might be unfairly expecting of you, what does she put effort in to? It doesn't really sound like she has the same values as you, let alone an appreciation for your work effort. \n\nMight be a good idea to apologize for your wording, but make it clear that you've done the best you can for as long as you've known her and it was unfair to put the blame on your shoulders for her actions.

You accommodated hers to an extreme degree, letting her take your time and your sleep, and putting up with *daily* fights because you wanted to do well. That\u2019s bonkers. I know you say you love her, but I\u2019m not sure you loved either yourself or her well enough to be honest with her about how poorly she was treating you, the impact it had on you, and - as is now apparent- how you really feel about her lack of similar ambition and effort. \n\nIt seems the chickens have come home to roost, and your abrupt course correction sounds pretty harsh (though not necessarily unwarranted). \n\nI think you both need to sit with some questions about whether you can really each accept each other as you each are while also being true to yourself and your values.
