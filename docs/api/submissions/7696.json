Unfortunately 6 years ago there was a tragedy and my SIL passed in an accident and left my 20 month old nephew. \n\nAt that time I 29F was working in SF.  I asked the company I worked for if I could transfer to their NYC location and was able to do so. I moved in with my brother. He stopped working to spend time with his kid. I did my best to help - I paid the rent and groceries. I tried to keep the meals going when I came from work. I didn't mind, as i really loved coming home to my nephew and the rent was really cheap. The fact was that my SIL had 'inherited' a rent stabilized apartment from her parents after they retired and moved to a cheaper area about 1.5hrs from NYC. The rent was only $1450ish for a 2 bed that was over 1000sqft in Manhattan's Upper Eastside. \n\nAnyhow, when my nephew was going to start school my parent's convinced my brother to move back to Toronto and live with them. I took over the lease to his apartment as I was legally allowed to since I had lived there for a few years.  Its been over three years and he started working, my nephew started school, he met a new partner and he seemed like he was building a life again.\n\nLast week my brother told me that he, his GF and my nephew will be returning to NYC so he has requested to have his apartment back.  I told him , 'No' because my fianc\u00e9 and I were also planning to move in together and we had already made some really nice updates with a view to this being a long-term home for us. He would also have to live with me for 2 years before I could transfer the lease so I would have to delay my wedding.\n\nHe told me that I was an AH  for stealing his apartment and not letting him rebuild his life and allowing his child to move back into his mom's and grandparent's apartment that my nephew should technically inherit it. He says he signed the lease over to me so that he didn't lose the apartment. His previous wife's parents say I am taking advantage of an unfortunate situation.  Now I am thinking I should reconsider as perhaps I am being an AH, since my fianc\u00e9 and I could afford to pay a lot more rent, without it being as difficult as it would be for my brother.", "created_utc": 1674086194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fmjzm/aita_for_not_returning_my_inherited_apartment/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you hadn't been there when he left, he would have lost the apartment/cheap rent anyway, and it's not your fault he changed his mind.", "NTA. You can\u2019t put your life on hold for something that may or may not happen in the future. You made a life for yourself in New York. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to move out of the apartment now. If you didn\u2019t take the lease over, the apartment would have been lost anyway", "Nta.

I\u2019m leaning towards NTA but unfortunately your relationship with your brother may suffer if you keep the apartment", "NTA. He left. The apartment is in your name now. Nope. He decided to move out. Now he can look somewhere else.", "NTA since you've stated that, one, your brother was not clear when he left that he expected this, and two, the two years of cohabitation is a major disruption to blithely demand of him. I think point two may be even more important - sure, you and your fiance could pay more elsewhere, but what does that matter? You can up and leave next month but it won't help your brother get the apartment at rent control.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother just can't decide to upend your entire life based on his own life changes.  \nYou have a life and the lease is in your name.  \nAt the very least, he should give you six months to get your shit together and find another place.", "NTA - seems like you were trying to help your brother when you relocated to NYC , like you came and looked after him for over two years - the situation wasn\u2019t his fault but you didn\u2019t have to show up and help him either.

That's the only way i can see it work, than me staying with him for 2 years. Then he would have to take the risk of losing the apartment. I can't say he lives with me or has been living with me as his job is not even in the US! I had to show a lot of proof for the lease to be transferred to me. \n\nAs someone mentioned about the transfer of lease on a rental control only increasing 20% for a new lease, we looked at this before. There is a cleaners closet on our floor and the landlord is planning to incorporate that and a bit of the hall to create a tiny en-suite, like he has on other floors. That way he can classify the apartment as new and it will no longer be stabilized. \n\nI do have other concerns about my brother that are probably not my business, and I guess he has to start growing up again. I will express them here though: his GF he's known for just over a year and how is he just deciding to move to a new city with her? Also, I have no idea what he will do for work, or for childcare. He has  steady job in Toronto right now . He has a lot of help from my parent's  right now so I don't know if he realizes how much work it will be.  When I first moved in I pretty much took care of the entire rent for the apartment / household expenses and chores for over two years when he lived there to give him a break. He would have to be on one income as I don't think his GF can work as she's Canadian.\n\nI will probably have a chat to him in a few days when I feel more calmed down.", "NTA.  This is a RENTAL. Neither you, your brother or your brother's in-laws own this apartment.  NOTHING about this rental apartment can be inherited.  The building's owner is the only one that owns this.

You were all just fortunate about the cost for this rental.  \n\nYou have to decide what's best for you and your future.", "NTA I just don\u2019t think the logistics will work. He would have to move back and live with you for two years putting his gf and kid on hold. Or having a ton of people in a two bedroom apartment. It would be hell for two years. Is he expecting you to lie or cheat for this transfer? Because then you have the potential to lose the apartment full out. The logistics doesn\u2019t add up. Your asking everyone to have a rough life for two years. That\u2019s a lot of time. That\u2019s an associates degree or a masters. Yeah I don\u2019t think your a jerk to say no. I would explain the living situations to everyone they will come to same conclusion. Explain your life goals and plans and how you need those two years.", "Its like he suddenly forgot how you paid rent, groceries and took care of him and his baby?

NTA", "NTA.\n\nHe left. If you didn't stay, the family would have relinquished all rights to the apartment. So, without you staying there for years, there wouldn't be an apartment to fight over.\n\nAccording to the rules he explained to you when he left, you and he would need to live there together for some years before you can legally sign it over to him. And him living there without you could get him evicted.\n\nIs he suggesting that five or more of you live together for years? Or you leave, but keep your name on an apartment you don't live in, while he hopes no one notices?\n\nLogistically, there's just no way to get it back into his name with one or both of you taking huge risks.", "If your name is on the lease it's your apartment legally so NTA there. Ultimately it depends on what the lease says though", "NTA. He signed over the lease to you; it's yours now.", "INFO Um. What exactly does he want you to do? You *can\u2019t* give him back the apartment unless the two of you both live there together for two years. Otherwise you\u2019re in violation of rent stabilization laws. Are you supposed to live there with him, his girlfriend, your fianc\u00e9, and your nephew for two years? Because that sounds awful for everyone.

Any attempt to circumvent the rules would be breaking the law. NTA.", "Remember Monica\u2019s apartment on Friends? In an early episode, she mentioned that the only way she could afford to live there was because it was rent controlled and previously was leased to her grandmother. Monica was living there illegally because she didn\u2019t have the required residency to be the leaseholder so it was still in her grandmother\u2019s name. (In a later episode, the super threatened to have her evicted when someone spilled the beans.) \n\nIf OP\u2019s brother moved in now and kicked her out without establishing residency, he could still end up losing the apartment since he seems unwilling to follow the law and he\u2019d be there illegally. In any event, unless he explicitly said he was transferring the lease to the sister until he and his son were back on their feet\u2014and it doesn\u2019t appear he did\u2014he\u2019s basically SOL. No one owns the apartment and no one is stealing the nephew\u2019s inheritance. OP is NTA.", "NTA. What does your brother think was going to happen? He gave the apartment to you. It no longer belongs to him. If he wanted it to go to his son then he shouldn't have taken himself off the lease.

I don't live in NYC but did for a little, and I have family that lives there. People would kill for what you're getting, so I get why you wouldn't want to let it go, so I get why you're thinking like it's my lease now - however, I also know about families passing that down.\n\nIf this had been inherited by your brother, and your brother didn't want it returned to his nephew, I would feel differently, but this was inherited by your SIL, so to me, it should be your nephew that should get it, not you. \n\nAs another commenter said as well - this could ruin your relationship with him. If he had said explicitly that he DIDN'T want it back, I would be willing to fight him on it, but since he didn't,  it makes it very unclear. He could've assumed that you were just holding it for him until he got better.", "NTA as long as you will it to your nephew", "Oof. Legally it\u2019s yours, so I understand all these N T As.

It was signed to you not for you to have it forever, but so that your brother didn\u2019t lose it altogether if he moved back in with your parents.\n\nMiscommunication happened here for sure, but given your brother\u2019s mental state when it was signed over, I think that can be forgiven. I\u2019d say N A H if you were willing to discuss it but the flat \u2018No\u2019 is where I think you\u2019re the AH.\n\nTalk through the options with your brother.

Would he have still moved in with your parents and forfeited the apartment, or stayed in NYC? He may eventually agree that you should stay because he\u2019d have lost it anyway.)

You couldn't sign it over to him if you wanted to, you'd either need to move him in (5 people in a 2bdr), lie about him living there for two years, or move out and let him live there under your name while you're responsible for any damage or unpaid rent.\n\nIf you can really afford market rent and want your brother to be able to get back on his feet in NYC the only option I can see is to put him on the lease and pretend her lives there for two years.

He is not entitled to it. Dont move out", "I\u2019m sorry for your family\u2019s loss. If I\u2019m understanding correctly, you moved across the country, paid rent and groceries for your brother and nephew, cooked meals for yourself and his family until he moved 2 years later. After another 4 years, he finally went back to work and met someone new while living rent free with your parents while they also helped him raise his son. Now he wants to come back and live with you for 2 years with his partner and child so that he can get his lease back which requires you to live separately from your partner, postpone your wedding and live with 3 extra people in a  2-bedroom apartment for an additional 2 years. Your brother is literally asking to turn 6 years of constant help into 8 years. Most people who lose a spouse do not receive that level of support that you and your parents have given him. They usually have to return to work after FML and scramble for child care, etc., all while still grieving.\n\nMy questions: Does he want you to move out and live there under your name? If you move will renting two apartments under your name affect your eligibility for a new apartment? If he gets caught living under your lease without you there will you have moved for nothing because he will be kicked off the lease? What happens to you if you get caught providing false information with the intent of keeping a rent-controlled apartment? Is your brother the least bit grateful so many people put their life on hold for 6 years now to make his life easier? NTA. \n\nYour brother\u2019s needs at this point are really wants.", "NTA.

Your brother shouldn't be so entitled about things. He didn't tell you he wanted to come back nor did he agree to sign the lease over on the condition that you hold it for him. You can't be expected to upend your life because his plans changed. Your brother seems unappreciative of all you did for him. It's a big deal to get a company transfer, move across the country, and essentially help him raise his kid. \n\nAt the same time, obviously, SIL would've wanted the apartment to go her son, and your brother probably wasn't thinking clearly when he moved to Toronto. You should both be more understanding of each other. \n\nI think your brother is more of an AH here because he expects you to say \"how high?\" when he says \"jump.\" He should have explained that he knows you're the legitimate leaseholder and you really pulled through for him when it mattered. He should have said \"thank you.\" Honestly, he should've offered you some compensation and moving expenses, and asked that you give him and his son this kindness, not demand it.", "NTA.  And why would he and his family need to live with you? You have 2 years on the lease. If he comes to NY, he needs to live on his own til you give up your lease. End of story. You could have moved back to SF when he went home to mom. He'd be in the same spot. In NY and in need of digs. Don't hurry, don't worry. Get married on your schedule as planned. Just tell him you'll  think about it in a few years. Even then you might not give it up. He'll be living elsewhere. No is no. You uprooted yourself to help him. He does not deserve to do it again. Stay the course. You deserve some things to be about you.", "NTA", "NTA. He moved away. End of story.", "Perhaps I'm missing something? Why would you want to live in a rental long term? Isn't the eventual goal for most people to buy their own property? I don't get it", "No AH here. I think you were fortunate to take over this apartment at a time of unfortunate events. Your brother and nephew clearly left for the right reasons. \n\nYWBTA if you stayed but sounds like you would be doing a solid for your brother and nephew if you let them have the apartment back especially considering you can afford to live somewhere else.", "NTA.  But if you did want to move. Put the apartment in your nephews name. Technically, it's his. Protect his future.", "You nailed the crux of the issue.  It sounds like OP is willing to sign the lease back over, but there is a condition that has to be met for that to happen.  That condition is outside the control of OP or her brother.  \n\nOf course, there is a reason why the condition exists, and that is to prevent the back and forth of rent stabilized leases.\n\nBrother needs to work through potential solutions instead of throwing a temper tantrum.", "Its pretty clearly stated the dude was depressed over the loss of his wife, and their parents convinced him to move home to help him get his life back on track with their support. He didn't \"decide\" for his wife to tragically pass away.", "Honestly he has no business \u201cgiving\u201d her any form of notice, 6 months or otherwise. the lease is in her name and she\u2019s the one who lives there. He has no right to evict anyone, it\u2019s not like he owns the apartment and is leasing it to her. Some other third party owns it. Best he can really do is ask her nicely to transfer the lease back to him.", "I would have been sympathetic if the brother had communicated his plans to move back in and take over the lease at some point, and they had some sort of agreement. But, that was not the case.\n\nAnd, no, he can't just give her notice and then wait for her to settle elsewhere. They'd have to live together two years before he could even put his name back on the agreement. It's an outrageous ask for so many different reasons. And OP has made up her mind, and it's her decision. She doesn't owe her brother anything.\n\nIt's OP's apartment now. And as far as NYC housing goes, this is literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. No wonder she doesn't want to give it up just to keep the peace.", "Yes he told me he was moving back, but it would be in the summer. Ommitted it in the post.", "I wouldn\u2019t say ex in-laws, they are child\u2019s grandparents. And the grandparents transferred the lease to SIL, grandparents were the first ones in the house", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t recommend bending over backwards to make this happen for your brother. Either keep it for you and your fianc\u00e9e or move out and let your brother fight to get it. You\u2019ve already uprooted your life once to help your brother. It\u2019s time to focus on what\u2019s best for you and your fianc\u00e9. If your brother is really expecting you to live with him, his girlfriend and your nephew for 2 years so the apartment can be transferred back to him then he is being selfish. Especially when you\u2019re getting married and starting that part of your life. What kind of dynamic do you two have? Is he used to you complying to his wishes?", "It\u2019s not strictly speaking an inheritance, but existing rent controlled leases can be transferred by the tenants between certain classes of relatives while they can\u2019t be transferred to anyone else. OP is describing the situation accurately per NY City law. The landlord would probably prefer that OP move out so he can charge full market value to a new tenant, but we don\u2019t care what the landlord wants.", "But in NYC rent stabilized leases can be passed on to certain members of family. I bet the landlord is super watching this apartment because his property tax will be higher than the rent received. These places can\u2019t even be sold because the tenants never leave and the new buyer has to inherit them and their controlled rent. It\u2019s nuts!", "> Its like he suddenly forgot how you paid rent, groceries and took care of him and his baby? You aren't freeloading and you never have.\n\nExactly! He's treating OP like she preyed on him in order to profit from his moment of weakness.\n\nOP sacrificed alot in order to help him. If, as a result of his voluntary departure, she took over the apartment, he should not begrudge her that. \n\nAmazing what money can do; the brother is now confrontational with the person who sacrificed for years in order to support him.", "He left to live with my parent's in Toronto. He never explicitly said he planned to come back -  He just told me that he was signing over the lease to me as if he 'the leaseholder' doesn't live there I could get evicted and it would be a shame for me to live somewhere else paying twice the rent for half the apartment.  I was the only person that it could've been assigned to. \n\nWhen he left he was in a really bad place, he had quit his job and was really depressed. It was quite hard for me, but I wanted to help him, thats why I came but my parent's suggested that he should come home as they could better support him - he never said he would be back and I didn't ask him about his long-term plans", "I get what you're saying but it sounds like he, his child, and his GF would have to live with OP (and her fiance) together in a 2BR apartment for 2 years in order for her to be able to transfer it back to him. That is just not realistic.", "Yeah, but that\u2019s not one of the options.

For her to even be able to transfer the lease back, OP\u2019s brother and OP would both have to live there together for two years, and even then the landlord might be able to make a case that it\u2019s not an organic transfer.

Lots of pretty wealthy people rent for their whole lives. Especially if they have a rent controlled apartment. They\u2019ll save so much on the below market value rent that it\u2019ll be financially better for them than buying something at market value.", "I\u2019m also curious what their relationship was like before this. Maybe the brother is used to OP complying with his demands. Otherwise I\u2019m having trouble understanding the brother feeling entitled to a rental property that neither he nor his in laws ever owned, his calling it an inheritance comes across delusional. I highly doubt the real owners feel the same way and it\u2019s probably why they have these rules like you mentioned", "Still, when he moved out, the apartment went to OP. OP is now legally responsible.", "That *really* doesn\u2019t mean OP should be obligated to live with him, his new girlfriend, and his child, for the next two years, while putting her own life on hold.", ">Best he can really do is ask her nicely to transfer the lease back to him.\n\nLol it\u2019s not how it works. This isn\u2019t up to OP. It doesn\u2019t matter if the brother asks OP to transfer the lease back to her, that\u2019s up to the landlord, unless the brother and/or son and/or son\u2019s gf resides there for two years while OP also lives there. The landlord is under zero obligation to rent at a reduced rate to anybody except OP or anybody else entitled to that rent reduction under the law.", "Agree - all the more reason they should have supported their grandson.", "She was there for him! Moved across the country! Helped him go through his grief and raise a baby that was not even a year old. Besides that, OP has been there this whole time in this apartment and has obviously begun moving forward with their life, as they should. \n\nI completely agree with everything you said.", "So in theory he could have ignored you and left, leaving you without a place and having to go elsewhere and spend more.", "What would have happened with the apartment if he hadn\u2019t signed it over to you? Was he/your parents in a position to keep paying the rent in the apartment just for the sake of keeping it, or was this a situation where none of you would have the apartment any more if he hadn\u2019t signed it over to you?\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for you to know at this point, but IMO that\u2019s the deciding factor. If he was signing it over to you to make sure you weren\u2019t evicted, but would have kept it otherwise, then YTA. If he would have lost the apartment when he moved back in with your parents, then NTA.", "So it would only be allowed to go back to your brother. Knowing that, your brother should have realized what he was signing up for when he let you take it. You can\u2019t be expected to put your life on pause for two years for the sake of an apartment.", "I think you really need to discuss this with a lawyer well versed in nyc property law because none of this sounds kosher. This is coming from an attorney that grew up in nyc and has dealt with rent control transfers personally though only once did it come up in a case and it was something I pulled in a colleague to manage. But none of this sounds right or makes sense", "Are you ok with losing your relationship with your brother over this", "Since your brother and nephew have moved out, that may change things. Run it by a lawyer first.", "Yeah, I realize now why OP put inherited in quotes.", "There\u2019s a lease that\u2019s still under rent control. If someone new moves in, the apartment will be rented at full market value. It\u2019s a NY thing.", "I\u2019m not missing that at all. I\u2019m saying all five of them living there together for two years isn\u2019t the only option to enable any eventual transfer back, and they need to have a conversation about it.\n\nCould he live there with the gf and son nearby? Could all five of them live between two places? How many nights of the year constitutes living there? I don\u2019t know the details. They need to discuss the details. And if they\u2019re unworkable, so be it. But TALK.", "I am aware.  Hence my response.  SIL got it from her parents, and eventually it would have gone to her nephew which is why I said morally.", "Any scenario where he gets the apartment back would be... Except maybe the 5 of them living in the apartment together for two years but that's probably a lease violation too.", "I'm not positive, but I believe the rules surrounding rent stabilized apartments in NYC are defined by NYC.  \n\nThe rent stabilization protects tenants from the excesses we're seeing in other parts of the country (looking at you Tampa), and the limitation on the leases being passed protects landlords from never getting the apartment back.  Otherwise OP could charge someone for the privilege of a historically stabilized rent.", "? I realize the landlord isn\u2019t under any obligation to anyone except for op. By transferring the lease back to him I meant following the proper procedure for doing so, which yes, would include them living together for two years. He can ask nicely but she can absolutely say no.", "Why be buddy buddy with an asshole?", "Her brother is okay with losing his relationship with his sister. Why should she have to sacrifice for him? Why can\u2019t he be the one to care about their relationship?", "And nephew most likely. Parents will probably hold it against her as well.", "Not quite, there\u2019s a percentage cap on the amount the rent can be increased.", "But if the sister didn\u2019t take over the lease it would\u2019ve been lost anyway", "You're getting way ahead of yourself", "[deleted]", "Because most people actually want relationships with family or others. It\u2019s very easy for you to say cut off a relationship with him", "You can\u2019t gift a house that you are renting.", "Obviously he doesn't give a flying fuck about her life", "Because he wants a apartment op only has because his wife died and he was so depressed he had to move back home ?", "But if he hadn\u2019t given it to her, it would have been rented to a stranger.", "Correct he did op a massive favour by not giving it to a stranger. You get it", "And now it\u2019s her apartment. He would have lost it either way. But now it\u2019s his sister\u2019s and not a stranger\u2019s home. He\u2019s not entirely to the apartment.", "You mean the massive favor like upending her life, moving across the country, and paying rent + groceries + basically took care of a sibling and nephew for three years? Oh wait, no, that was OP."]}
