Social dancing often has partner changing, and it is a good way to learn.  But her running off to one particular guy and then full on salsa dancing with him because she knows he's a much better dancer, whilst this may be  *within* the social code at a dance night, does feel a little weird.\n\nOn the other hand this part *\"I need to work on my communication skills, but in my head, it's just not worth the effort on a first date\"* if you mean that you won't bother trying to communicate well on a first date (including expressing vulnerability)then that's not great.", "Swear to God this exact scenario happened in Jennifer Aniston film except that he did not leave and I think they ended up together in the end (was it Along Came Polly?).", "We aren\u2019t all great at everything. I have a surprising number of friends who are professional/competitive dancers, and one consistent thing that they all do with less experienced dance partners, is switch out a lot. \n\nUnless you\u2019ve had that unbelievable feeling of flowing across the floor and being so in sync with your partner, you might not appreciate just how limiting it is to dance with someone who\u2019s just getting by. \n\nI\u2019d much rather watch them than make anyone feel obligated to cater to my limited abilities. But I don\u2019t have as much ego as I do appreciation for talent. \n\nIn the end, this is somewhere between NAH and Everyone Sucks, because in all genuine honesty, you two obviously aren\u2019t compatible. You shouldn\u2019t need relationship advice for a first date; you either enjoyed it or you didn\u2019t. \n\nNeither of you enjoyed it. Move on. \n\nYou\u2019re not a dick for not being able to keep up with her, but kinda dicky/kinda newb for not being able to let her have a few dances where she can really cut loose. \n\nShe\u2019s not a dick for wanting to dance. \n\nEveryone just pick up your toys and go home, no harm no foul.

Some Salsa events are more \"couply\", where you dance with the person you came with. Most are more \"social\" where you dance 1 or 2 songs with someone and then dance with someone else. Some are in between those extremes. I'm not sure how her dancing with someone else would improve your skills at all (that's illogical on her part), but it's **definitely** rude to comment on another person's skill level and also rude to showboat. A social dance is also a trial-by-fire type situation and should probably be avoided as a first/second/third date unless both people are at the same level. The problem is people don't objectively know their own skill level. Even if she took the time to teach you, it's awkward to do it at a social especially with everyone watching. I want to say NTA, because if she's as good as you say she is, she should know the ins and outs of the Dancing Etiquette.", "NTA", "YTA. She asked if it was okay and you said yes. She\u2019s right that you need to work on communication skills.", "YTA - at social dances it is normal to dance with other random people not just the person you came with. It\u2019s even normal to go to social dances by yourself. She explained to you her rationale and you chose to read more into it than was there. It sounds like you are possessive and prone to unreasonable jealousy so in addition to your dancing, you might want to work on that.", "YTA. Before you ditch another date over your insecurities, try honest answers to their questions.", "ESH, she should have put more effort into the date side of the night instead of the dance part...\n\nBut you did tell her it was okay to dance with someone else, thats also generally how these nights work, and you should have gone up to her and expressed your disconfort rather than leaving like that.", "I'm gonna go with an ESH.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you didn't know this. \n\nMy issue with you, is that she *asked* you if she could dance with someone else, and you said sure. My issue with her is that she could have explained her motivation behind dancing with someone else a bit better, so she didn't hurt your feelings. \n\nIn this scenario, you both could have communicated a **LOT** better with each other.", "This.

I recognize that I probably should've though if I wanted things to work out.", "And the guy she dances with is gay, so his worrying was for nothing", "I agree with this. I used to go to Latin clubs and that's how it was - dance partners aren't exclusive. If someone is less experienced (me), the good dancers would switch out quite a bit, and you'd read the room to know to sit out when it's time to let the good dancers have fun for a bit.\n\nI agree that this was probably not the best idea for a \"first date\" kind of situation with someone who is not familiar with it. Personally I didn't grow up with \"dating\" culture (I grew up Germany). If you liked someone and got along, you just did stuff together and see where it went (could be with other friends or just the two people), it was a lot more organic. There wasn't such a clear expectation that now you're formally \"dating\", so have to focus on the other person. Dancing with someone else would have been perfectly acceptable.", "Disagree. Have enough self awareness to not ask such a dumb thing on a first date.", "This was a first date. The entire point of a first date is to get to know someone. What is the point of going on a date with someone if they are going to spend it dancing/talking with someone else?\n\nNow maybe this was a poor choice of a first date, but this girl was being very inconsiderate. She showed that she was clearly more interested in the salsa than she was in OP. It would be like if you went on a coffee date with someone, then instead of talking to you, they spent half the date talking to someone else. Rude, right? I don't blame OP for leaving. Yeah, he probably should have said something in person. But that doesn't make OP the AH.", "If he had said no, she would have given the same response.", "Um, that's not being insecure.

The only thing I would change is just telling her to her face that I dont think things are gonna work. Dating nowadays is a fickle thing. That type of behavior early on is not the type i find attractive.", "Maybe she was looking for a man who could command the room and take charge, despite his lack of knowledge with the tippy tappy dance slappy. Either way, it wasn\u2019t a match and he exited the experience less gracefully then I\u2019m sure he desired. At least he didn\u2019t cause a scene or anything.", "The reason she asked was to see if it was alright, with you. And you said YES. Then you ditched her. The only person who didn't do the right thing was you.", "I think he handled this perfectly. The girl is very rude and she should have left if she wasn\u2019t feeling it.

Solely by the fact that it wouldn\u2019t be an ideal situation given the roles were reversed (how would you feel being in his shoes). While it became a grey areas given he did consent to her dancing with someone else, if it a) were a test, she sucks b) a demonstration of how to improve, it seems pretty sketchy and insincere, as she could have helped by teaching HIM. \n\nBut irregardless, it was a date not a salsa class in the traditional sense.\n\nI don\u2019t feel it unreasonable to feel some sort of disrespect in that situation and his response was acceptable given that he was gaslit into accepting she dance with another partner as it would \u201chelp him learn\u201d how to dance and then made to feel immature for having very valid emotions from being fobbed off and ignored.", "Just because you ask permission before you do something rude, it doesn't make that action any less rude.", "OMG have you never been to a salsa dancing event?

At latin dance events dancing with diffferent partners is literally the norm", "I don't fault OP for not being ok with it. It's not for everybody. Even if he awkwardly said yes and thought better of it after she started dancing he should have done the right thing and told her that he was leaving.
