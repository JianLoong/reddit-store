The oldest is 10 and the youngest is almost 3.\n\nMy youngest son has never had a proper haircut. His hair is fairly long, and his mom refuses to cut it. It gets in his face, is curly so tangles easily, and IMO doesn't look good. I try at keep his hair tied up, but he doesn't like it much and takes it out.\n\nHis mom is a bit of a hippy and is very pro boys can have long hair too. I have no issues with boys having long hair. My older son kept his hair shoulder length for a couple years. Both myself and my younger son's mom agree about allowing our son to make his own choices when applicable.\n\nMy older son is currently rocking a buzz cut and I've been re-shaving it at home every 2 or 4 weeks. I have both my sons with the same one week on/one week off, so my youngest son has been around every time I shave his brother's hair.\n\nAround 3 months ago while watching me shave his brother's hair he wanted me to do his hair too. Over the next week, I asked him about getting his haircut and he said he wanted to. I texted his mom and told her he wanted a haircut. She told me no but that she would ask him when he was with her. She later texted me saying he told her he didn't want shorter hair.\n\nBut again, the next time I was shaving his brother\u2019s hair he wanted me to do his too. I texted his mom again and said I really think he does want his haircut and that as he's almost 3 he can have his first proper haircut. I suggested taking him to my friend's barbershop together and getting a decent chunk of hair off. She again denied me.\n\nI don't know if she thought I was lying because son was saying something different with her or she was lying or my son just changing his mind.\n\nOn Sunday when I was buzzing brother's hair, he was again adamant about wanting his cut. I had honestly been so sick of dealing with his hair and knowing that he wanted it cut made it more frustrating.\n\nI ended up taking him to my friend's barbershop that same day. I texted his mom before we left to give a heads up. I knew she would be mad but at that point I didn't care. I showed him photos of other boy's haircuts on my phone and let him pick one he liked. He sat really well for his haircut and seemed super happy afterwards. He wanted to facetime his mom to show her, she was very shocked but masked her unhappiness/irritation for our son.\n\nAfter we hanged up, she immediately texted me telling me she hated me and that I'm an asshole and a bunch of other stuff. When I dropped son back with her on Monday, I could tell how angry she was.\n\nOther people have also told me this was an AH move and I do feel bad that the haircut has saddened my ex. However, why is it anymore her right to decide whether he gets his hair cut, because she's a mom and I'm a dad? If son didn't want a haircut, I'd be the asshole. If son didn't care either way, you could argue I'm the asshole. But when 2 out of 3 of the people that get a say in his hair wanted it cut? I'm not sure.

It\u2019s pretty obvious she lied considering how your son enjoyed his haircut.", "NTA\n\nShe probably wanted her baby to keep his baby hair a little longer. Very rarely do those toddler curls grow back and the first haircut generally signifies that he\u2019s a little boy now. It\u2019s kind of bittersweet for a lot of moms.\n\nBut, if that were the case she should have told you that she wanted to keep the hair or been more proactive about setting a care routine for his curls.", "The hair wars.   It is hair.  It grows back. I assume you have joint custody and have as much right to decide to cut as she does not to cut. \n\nBut you two need to figure out a way to put the kid first, and start by letting the small stuff go.

He's only asking when he sees his big brother getting it done. After one disagreement with the mom, you should have stopped shaving his brother's hair in front of him and tried to at least talk to the mom about talking to your son together about if he wants a haircut, not just after he watched his brother get it.", "this is an asshole move. I am assuming she's the custodial parent? You never make decisions like this without consent from the custodial parent. Ever. His hair wasn't bothering you, you didn't have to wear it.

When he was with you, clearly he wanted it short because he wanted to be like his brother. When he was with his mother, I\u2019ve little doubt he probably did tell her he liked his hair because in all likelihood, she told him how great it was & praised him, then asked. Your argument for \u2154 is weak to me since it\u2019s reasonably easy to compel a 3 year old\u2019s opinion either way on something like this.\n\nYou suck for doing it while she wasn\u2019t around. She sucks for having some weird attachment to his hair. Do I think it was probably better to get his hair cut for the sake of simplicity? Yes, & I\u2019d be lying if I said I wouldn\u2019t have done the same.
