In my country, if you have pink eye and it's not allergies, you stay home. And you can imagine small kids: they were running around, coughing and touching everything. I was speechless. I said to my bf that pink eye was contagious and his reply was: \"don't be afraid of everything.\" I got irritated by this because it sounded condescending and like I was the crazy one. So my mood was ruined,  and I was pretty much silent the whole time there. I also didn't want to eat a lot because the kids were coughing and touching the food, so I only had a few bites from things I saw the kids hadn't touched.\n\nAt home he said my behavior was rude and I was acting crazy.

Parents should not be taking their kids out if they are sick. It's not something that is acceptable in any culture.", "NTA. I'm baffled that any person would think that it's okay to be in public spaces with a contagious sickness, even if it's something as \"little\" as pink eye. You had every right to voice your discomfort, and shame on your boyfriend for not accepting what you had to say and hearing you out.", "NTA. Pink eye is very contagious. Your brother is inconsiderate for inviting you over knowing his whole family is sick. If they wanna be gross and spread germs they can do it with each other. There\u2019s no need to spread their germs to you.", "Pink eye is EXTREMELY contagious.  My former office mate was out because her son had pink eye, and when she came back she brought Lysol and cleaned the entire office JUST IN CASE she'd brought in pink eye with her.  I don't think it's a matter of hygiene, I think it's that the family is not all that bright.  The best thing I can say about them is maybe no one told them so they don't know.  Yet.  But they will.", "NTA.

Different people have different comfort levels when it comes to illness. I take it grandparents had no issue with them there which is pretty common in families with kids,  they get used to germs. Schools let kids back to school 24 hours after starting eye drops for pink eye.... which incidentally is silly bc most pink eye is actually viral so the eye drops are really only therapeutic, not killing infection. In fact before covid most schools said to send your kids in with cold symptoms as long as they did not have fevers. I'm in a large school district and they still have the \"should I keep my child home chart\" online that says that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parents who take sick children out around other people are a huge pet peeve of mine.  I would reacted much as you did.  Heck, I might have just left and gone home.  Pink eye sucks.  No one wants to have that.  \n\nHowever, I suspect the use of the word \"hygienic\" is what set him off.  People tend to see that as implying dirty and gross and attach some sort of moral judgement to it.

Fever or not. We are just getting through a pandemic. Sick people should be staying home and practicing good hygiene. OP asked if it is contagious, viral pink eye is highly contagious, so is bacterial. Judging from the boyfriends response, it was likely contagious.  I dont know anyone who would defend bringing sick children out, especially around vulnerable people, such as grandparents.", "Aint nobody needing a scrubbing cloth when washing ur body because using your hands to lather and cleanse your body is generally sufficient for most individuals. (I'm assuming ur talking about body but hands is the same argument basically)\n\nAlso it holds it's risks that many are unaware of or don't prevent sufficiently enough for example it will accumulate a lot of bacteria if you don't wash it regularly with the rest of ur hand towels and such, leave it to dry not in a damp environment like a bathroom (very often ignored!!!), use different cloth for different parts you get me, replace every so often etc. \n\nIt seems like a nice addition for the dead skin on ur body but more often than not people aren't maintaining it properly so it's plagued with bacteria anyway and gross. Your hands do the job more than fine with soap and such."]}
