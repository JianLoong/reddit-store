I also didn't want to eat a lot because the kids were coughing and touching the food, so I only had a few bites from things I saw the kids hadn't touched.\n\nAt home he said my behavior was rude and I was acting crazy.

I'm baffled that any person would think that it's okay to be in public spaces with a contagious sickness, even if it's something as \"little\" as pink eye. You had every right to voice your discomfort, and shame on your boyfriend for not accepting what you had to say and hearing you out.", "NTA. Pink eye is very contagious.

Different people have different comfort levels when it comes to illness. I take it grandparents had no issue with them there which is pretty common in families with kids,  they get used to germs. Schools let kids back to school 24 hours after starting eye drops for pink eye.... which incidentally is silly bc most pink eye is actually viral so the eye drops are really only therapeutic, not killing infection.

Parents who take sick children out around other people are a huge pet peeve of mine.  I would reacted much as you did.  Heck, I might have just left and gone home.  Pink eye sucks.  No one wants to have that.  \n\nHowever, I suspect the use of the word \"hygienic\" is what set him off.

Fever or not. We are just getting through a pandemic. Sick people should be staying home and practicing good hygiene.

(I'm assuming ur talking about body but hands is the same argument basically)\n\nAlso it holds it's risks that many are unaware of or don't prevent sufficiently enough for example it will accumulate a lot of bacteria if you don't wash it regularly with the rest of ur hand towels and such, leave it to dry not in a damp environment like a bathroom (very often ignored!!!), use different cloth for different parts you get me, replace every so often etc. \n\nIt seems like a nice addition for the dead skin on ur body but more often than not people aren't maintaining it properly so it's plagued with bacteria anyway and gross. Your hands do the job more than fine with soap and such.", "NTA. Pink eye is super contagious. But this actually sounds like Covid. The newer strain symptoms start out as pink eye. Since the parents were coughing up a storm, I would get yourself tested.", "NTA. It is incredibly inconsiderate to take sick kids with infectious diseases to a family gathering or anywhere else.
