I'm from northern Europe, Scandinavia and the official advice regarding treatment and when you should stay at home seems to be more relaxed than the measures taken by a large part of the comments.  **This is how your disagreement could be influenced by cultural differences:**\n\nI don't know if your boyfriend is Scandinavian, but this is what the Norwegian health department advices which according to the comments is unhygienic: [HelseNorge](https://www.helsenorge.no/sykdom/oyesykdommer/oyekatarr/)\n\n\\-Conj normally sorts it self out after 1 week. No antibiotics will be given unless there is a more serious case. Mild-moderate cases will not be prescibed antibiotics. There is no reason to go to a doctor unless you have more severe case, like large amount of pus, decreased general state of health.\n\n\\- No reason to recommend children with mild to moderate conj to stay home from kindergarten. Keep child home if it's a more severe case with a lot of pus. Kindergarten teachers can not in general demand kids with conj to be examined by a doctor or treated with eyedrops before they come back. \n\n\\-Recommendations for less severe cases are different types of eyedrops and creams. \n\n\\-General recommendation to ease symptoms yourself and avoid infecting others by cleaning your eyelid from pus. Don't let anyone else use the same cloth. Wash your hands often and don't share towels and pillows.\n\n**-There is no recommendation to stay at home with a mild-moderate infection.** There is no recommendation for adults to stay at home, even with a severe case to prevent spreading infection!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI checked other Norwegian sites which provide medical information and they all say basically the same. The recommendations in another country might be different. Cultural differences impact health advice.\n\nI have never heard of anyone here staying at home to avoid spreading conj. other than children with severe cases. People in my class went to school with an infection, I've done it when I was 13-ish it was never an issue. Not seen as unhygienic. Washing your hands, not touching your face, and not sharing stuff like makeup is seen as enough for adults in general. This is also supported by national advice as stated earlier. \n\nYour boyfriends reaction sounded very similar to how many people in Norway would react. Coughing could be due to many factors, not necessarily them being sick. A bit of coughing is not something that keeps you at home for most people here, but it is expected that you minimize the spread of your cough. Again if the children didn't have severe cases there is no need to keep them at home according to Norwegian health standards. For you to get Pink eye the children need to touch their eyes, touch you directly in your eye or on another surface and then you have to touch that surface and then your own eyes. For an adult its not that hard to avoid touching your eyes, washing your hands a bit more and keeping some distance to the kid.\n\nCalling them unhygienic is kind of rude, but also understandable if your from a place that practises different actions to the same issue. To you his family is unhygienic, their standard is below what is the accepted norm where you're from. However his family's actions are not unhygienic according to at least Norwegian standard. If the advice is similar where he's from, they are behaving within an accepted norm assuming most citizens follow the health advices. Reacting like you did to behaviour that is more or less the social norm in their country, could easily be seen as extreme. Both of you are reacting according your your respective cultural backgrounds/upbringings and their respective social norms and health guidelines.  It is understandable that you find it a bit shocking, and it is understandable that he thinks your are overreacting. \n\n(In Norway were pretty relaxed compared to how many in the comments acts about the spread of diseases that are not that serious, you should take precautions but you only stay at home if you are really sick.

We had covid (my dad took us to the Dr) and I felt terrible my parents were exposed (they already had it one time from my sister and her kids though) but we didn't leave the house until Christmas Eve when we were better.", "Nta. It is highly contagious (which i am sure if they have 2 kids or been to dr, they know). But also, for them to be running around w a cough, rather its covid, cold, whatever, theres a possibility it is contagious. As a society, i think we have all learned the value of not spreading germs (i would hope). My husband & mil are fighting covid right now (thankfully its mild). It truly bites being quarantined, i missed fathers day n my dad is in his 80s, not sure how many more he has). It is so selfish they couldn't have enough respect for their parents, their brother or you to stay away. And really, what kids want to be out & about when sick?", "NTA. You\u2019re right. That entire family should\u2019ve stayed home so as not to infect anyone. They\u2019re gross.", "NTA - that makes me sick just thinking about it", "I never comment on these but I had to just to tell you that you\u2019re NTA. I\u2019m not gonna repeat what everyone else has said already to validate you but I would like to add that it\u2019s your body & you have every right to not want to be around anyone with any contagious illness simply because you don\u2019t want to! Calling his family unhygienic might\u2019ve been a little sharp to the ears but it\u2019s the truth. Any hygienic & respectful person would have politely declined attendance due to the illness. That\u2019s all.", "It's not cultural. I'm from northern Europe (specifically UK) and I would stay home/keep kids home in this situation, but know others (there and here in Australia) who don't. There are gross people in every country. NTA", "NTA. He just doesn\u2019t realize his family isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d, for him this is just the standard.", "NTA that's so gross (of his family)", "Like 5 years ago my roommate had pink eye so I drove her to urgent care since her glasses were broken & she couldn\u2019t put her contacts in to see well enough to drive. \n\nShe brought sanitizing wipes with her in the car and wiped the door handle down as she got out. \n\nShe texts me 5 min later \u201cwhen I told the receptionist I was here for pink eye she told me to just keep the pen I was filling out forms with\u201d.\n\nNTA", "Throw the whole bf away, they sound like covid deniers or something", "Have you seen the news that the newest round of COVID has pink eye as a symptom? I wouldn\u2019t be concerned over COVID except you said the parents were coughing.", "I once got pink eye from a small child while running a children\u2019s story hour at a local library. While busy dealing with the craft a toddler started tugging at my skirts so without really looking a picked them up in one arm and kept working. I\u2019ve never been so horrified as when I looked down a few minutes later and saw that the child I\u2019d been holding, and who had been putting their hand all over my face, had pink eye. It took everything in me not to immediately drop the kid.", "God damnit...\n\nMy nieces (1200 miles away!) have pink eye.  Guess I better ask my brother if they've been tested.", "That was my exact thought when OP said the parents were coughing like crazy. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they all had covid.", "I have small children (3 and under) and I can't do drool. Pus from the eye and snot coming out the nose makes me gag. And I've been puked on, pooped on and peed on. Not to mention my 3yr old HANDS me his boogers\ud83d\ude43\n\nBut snotty noses are not for me.", "When you can pass along whatever made you sick easily.", "But you can handle ejaculations. Ok got it. Good for you!", "From the US and it isn\u2019t allowed here. My kid is seemingly allergic to everything and would get sent home at the start of allergy season for pinkeye most years. Luckily it was never pinkeye.", "Scary too. Thirty years later, I still remember the terror of waking up one morning and being totally unable to open my eyes. My eyelids were glued together, and it took a fair bit of soaking to remove all the gunk. One of those moments when I was so glad my mother was there.", "Maybe parents thought kids were whining when they really were sick. With younger kids, the parents might lack childcare options besides having them go anyway.\n\nIn general even besides contagiousness working sick might mean you're in no shape to get much work done anyway", "I think I remember having a mild version of that when I was younger. It took *a lot* of rubbing my eyes to get them to open halfway. Eye drops took care of the rest of it", "This is the exact memory I was just having. Your eyes are supposed to open when you wake up in the morning. When they don't, and you can feel they're sealed shut with sandy glue, it's *scary*!", "Honestly i\u2019m surprised. It\u2019s a little odd that schools don\u2019t use the nhs advice to base these policies on.", "That must be such a headache where doctors and nhs say to go to school and school send kids back home. Seems to be widespread across the US too, cdc say it\u2019s fine to send kids if your doctor says it\u2019s ok."]}
