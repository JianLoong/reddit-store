We didn\u2019t know the reason and occasionally resented it, but had a normal childhood and did have occasional sleepovers.\n\nI found out the reason as an older teen. When I went to college, I made a lot of great friends. Through the years of friendship , I discovered more than one of them had been molested (not by immediate family members).\n\nI\u2019m not saying your child is at risk of molestation. I\u2019m saying I\u2019m grateful my mom did her best to protect me.

If my kid advised me that a parent hits their kid? No way I'd be comfortable  sending them for a sleepover.  I'd extend the invite directly to the parents, assuring them you are familiar with food allergies, etc.  If they say no, that's their choice.  Trust your gut on this one, Mama.  Good luck.", "NTA- being cautious about people you don\u2019t know is just smart parenting. You are the person tasked with raising and protecting your children, and you\u2019re doing exactly that.", "NTA\n\nI'm a mandated reporter being in the medical field.  If my child told me this I would have a non-threatening discussion with him/her as to what, exactly, he/she was told.   I would have to report it if it fit the criteria.  The child could be exaggerating or she could be calling out for help.  It's not a good place to find yourself in but looking at your posted circumstances, I would not allow my child to stay there.   You could consider calling someone at her school if it sounds serious but you're hesitant to call CPS.", "I would make a bigger effort to get to know the other family as well as the other friends family. You could also let them know that you want to have an understanding of their child\u2019s allergies so you could have safe play dates at your home. I hate everything about sleepovers as they tend to ruin the next day for everyone. We came up with the late over. We would let the kids hangout until 10 or 11. Seriously what do kids need to do after 11 except sleep. My son had a friend with allergies so severe that I didn\u2019t want that responsibility and I have a medical background. His mother was fine with it.", "NTA someone who works in child crimes once said sleepovers are a breeding ground for abuse and that she would never let her kid go. I think sleepovers are a rite of passage still tho. See if they can come over or if you can have a bbq or something to meet everyone who would be in the home. It\u2019s important to be informed and also give freedom for your kids to enjoy youth.", "NTA, my mum has never allowed me to sleep over for safety reasons. After growing up and reading so many crime stories, I now understand that you can never be too cautious, even with relatives. I would insist the other kids come to your place instead.", "Uh no I'm 18 and I wouldn't let my sister go sleep at a girl's house who has had abuse reports/accusations and a child shouldn't be hit period it's not about belief it's just wrong a butt whooping is different but it should be an exceedingly rare occurrence like almost not at all if any", "Nope, NTA.", "NTA. Yeah, screw that. I\u2019m a man, and my twelve year old isn\u2019t staying at anyone\u2019s house, unless Chris Hansen is there. There\u2019s way too many weirdos out there, protect your child.", "NTA. I think any parents who lets their children spend the night at the house of someone they barely even know is absolutely insane! \n\nYou guys heard in the news a few months ago about the teenagers who went to a friend\u2019s house for a sleepover and ended up dead right? The friend\u2019s dad killed everyone in the house and himself.", "NTA, especially if think about the hitting part.

Even after knowing those families, statistically its always those \"close\" to the family that do the unspeakable. Never. Not even relatives.", "NTA. How do you know that your child isn't going to get hit, or sexually abused? How do you know there are no guns in the house? Or drugs? Or that the kids won't be left alone overnight while the adults go out? My child has extremely few sleepover friends we'll allow, and it's all friends we're personal friends with the parents and have been for 10+ years and have been in their home MANY times. Your biggest role in parenting is protecting your child. The very first step with these people would be a play date at their home while you are visiting to \"have coffee\" and get to know the other family so you can see what goes on in their home. Your child is vulnerable while they are asleep and you have no idea what is happening in the home, you don't just send them off to anyone with no knowledge of who they are.", "Maybe you could be the first house for the sleepovers? That would give you time to get to know the kids and also their families a little bit more", "NTA. Many abuse stories originate in such an environment.

But you have been told that the friends' family doesn't uphold your same morals when it comes to how they choose to disapplin their children. What other things would/ could your daughter be exposed to without your knowledge. \n\nIf it were me, I'd have the sleepover at my house and invite your daughter's friends mom. That way, while the girls are doing their thing, you can get to know this family better. Even if your worst suspicions are true and this family can't be trusted with your daughter, the girls get to do the sleepover and can be school friends. Hopefully, by spending time with the new friends mom, you will  feel secure enough to let them host in the future. You might even get the bonus of meeting a new friend.", "Sorry but at 12, I do think that if you don't want your kid to be going to sleepovers with people you haven't gotten to know, you should absolutely be calling up the friends' parents they want to sleepover with and making an effort to get to know them.\n\n(That said, I would currently be warry about a kid sleeping over with this family based on the things you do know about them.)", "NTA!

HUGE NTA.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom would never let me sleep at a friend's house. Family, yes.\n\nIt was not for allergies, she just worried. She was not comfortable with it. Knowing her now, she probably would have not slept herself, just being worried. Mom's worry...forever.  \n\n10 years ago, in Canada, two brothers went to a sleepover, longtime friends of the family, a snake escaped and those boys were dead by the morning. A horrific incident but one which my mom, now a senior,  pointed out and said she always felt we were safer when she was nearby.\n\nSo, no sleepovers for us.\n\nNot to worry, we grew up fine. No trauma. No resentments.  And she still worries about us.", "At 12 I didn't know any of the parents that my son had sleepovers at. NTA for having these insecurities,but the dynamics change with regards to meeting parents of school age kids when they hit their teen years. He had a fair few sleepouts at 12 and I knew where the parents lived but didn't even know their names \ud83d\ude02They were just xyz's mum/dad. I think I'm more relaxed though because he had been sleeping out with people I didn't know since he was six through scouts.", "Trust your instincts. Don\u2019t second guess them. NTA", "I mean if he has a phone, knows what to do in case of emergency and they know where he lives I don\u2019t see what could go wrong. My kid had little to no friends so when she found one I had to weigh her childhood happiness against my fears. Sometimes our fears get the best of us. \n\nIf he was any younger I\u2019d say no, but 12 is a good solid age. If you like the friend there\u2019s no real reason to think the parents are abusive. Plus, you\u2019re hearing the \u201chits\u201d thing as if it\u2019s true. Abuse is a huge subject that shouldn\u2019t be believed or not based on gossip. \n\nI vote for letting him go on the sleep over. Let him have some fun, enjoy his friend.

You don't know the parents and you think the kid should suffer? How about calling the parents and asking all the questions you need to ask so your kid doesn't miss out? How they discipline their kids has nothing to do with you.
