The wedding was all planned out and ready as we had been planning it before the whole covid situation happened and we finally thought it was time to tie the knot.\nI asked my best friend (let\u2019s call him Derek) to be my best man along with his two kids (one boy and one girl) to be our flower girl and ring bearer. We adored the kids and we were their godparents so we obviously wanted to include them in some sort of way. They all agreed as long as the kids mother (Derek\u2019s girlfriend) was allowed to come as a guest. My wife and I agreed and we gave her an invitation which included a dress code (aka, don\u2019t wear white or anything that resembles a wedding dress). \nThe day of the wedding came and Derek told me his girlfriend was going to be a bit late. I was fine with it cause I wasn\u2019t close to her at all. In fact, she only agreed for us to be the godparents of her kids because they liked us so much. \nShe then came in just before my wife was meant to be coming down, wearing a short white imitation wedding dress. When I asked Derek what the hell she was wearing he told me that she wasn\u2019t wearing white. It was \u201cpearl\u201d, so this already infuriated me. When my wife began walking down the aisle she noticed her and became visibly upset but then continued to put a smile on her face. \nOnce we got to the reception (and all the kids were sent home) we all became a bit drunk. \nDerek then asked to do an announcement. At first I thought he was going to talk about us or about my wife and I as it was our wedding. Instead he was drunkingly mumbling about something along the lines of \u201cthought it was the perfect time\u201d then proceeded to propose to his girlfriend. My wife went to the bathroom as she was upset that they were taking the spotlight. I became angry and asked Derek and his girlfriend to leave the wedding and they refused. \nIt got to the point where I had to calm my wife down just to be able to cut the cake. When we cut the cake my drunk ass threw it at Derek\u2019s girlfriend dress and ruined it. I did tell them I\u2019ll pay for the dry cleaning but to get the fuck out my wedding, which they proceeded to do.\nNow Derek and his girlfriend are calling me an asshole for ruining the dress (which I have paid for dry cleaning) along with embarrassing them at my own wedding. I managed to get in contact with her family and they all said the dress had no value within the family. And, my family continue to send me hate for not apologising to them first and being \u201cthe bigger person\u201d.\nSo am I the asshole for being drunk and stupid when they took away my wife\u2019s spotlight on her special day? I do know there was probably a better way to handle it but I was drunk and just wanted to get back at them for ruining the love of my life\u2019s special day, but aita?", "created_utc": 1667765129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo10xc/aita_for_throwing_cake_at_my_best_mans/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
