As a kid my mother would think nothing of just barging into my bedroom and then demanding I do some chore. This was always how she ask me to do anything, this was not because she'd already asked and I'd not done it. There was never any knocking, never any warning, just BANG, door against the wall and in she'd come.\n\nAs I got older, she'd switch tactics. The door would open more slowly and she'd come slowly and gently sit on my bed and say something along the lines of \"If you were a good person you'd do X Y or Z.\"\n\nThis continued into my twenties and became frequently more and more annoying, she would never simply ask me to do something. She applied the same tactics to my younger brother who was also getting increasingly annoyed. Neither of us had any issues with having to do chores, we understood the need to do them, we just would have liked to been asked in a normal fashion without being treated like we'd done something wrong.\n\nWhen I was 25 I finally had a chance to leave home and lived with a friend for about 10 years. I finally had some privacy and did not have to suffer the attitude of my mothers method of asking me to do chores.\n\nThen I got a place of my own.\n\nAbout half a year in to living on my own in my own place, I came home from work and found my kitchen had been cleaned and rearranged. Totally rearranged. My microwave and toaster were in a different place, my coffee cup rack had been moved to a new home, even my fridge had been moved and was now facing a different direction. There were several other alterations as well and I found a note from my mother singing her own praises for tidying everything up while I was at work.\n\nMy fridge is taller than me, it towers over my mother and she had moved it. It took me an hour or so to get everything back where I had them and wanted them to be.\n\nA week later, I came back and she'd done it again, complete with a note. She also noted she'd rearranged the books in my bookcase. I spent the evening putting everything back again.\n\nI had the next working day off and had planned to spend a long weekend with my girlfriend and was just waiting for her to arrive when I heard the front door open. I'd not told anyone my plans as I was keeping the relationship secret as I didn't want to expose my girlfriend to my mother just yet. I'd just gotten out the shower and ran down in only a towel thinking I was facing burglars. It was really my dad who'd been sent around by mother to cut the lawn while I was out. Again no previous notice. I had to shoo him away.\n\nGuess what happened the next day as me and my girlfriend are having some private time enjoying one another's company?\n\nThe resulting argument with my mother wound up with her storming out the house and me later getting a text message filled with ramblings about she's never tried to control my life. It's been a month now and I've had no contact at all with either parent.
