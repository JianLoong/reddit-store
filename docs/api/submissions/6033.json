Banning women from coming to your home for 6 months doesn\u2019t make sense as a solution , you can\u2019t follow him at work or anytime he leaves your home to make sure he\u2019s faithful?! Sounds like this is a bigger issue than houseguests and you need to really decide after all this time do you trust him or not", "NTA. Tell him it\u2019s fine if he (pretends not to) remember the convo about girls spending the night, but tell him you haven\u2019t and won\u2019t forget the convo that he fantasizes about everyone he knows.   \n\nWhich, is gross, you\u2019ve got much bigger issues than someone just sleeping on your couch honey.", "this is a weird one. esh yeah everyone fantasizes but he actually jacked off to pictures of your friends and admits he fantasizes about his friends girlfriends? that\u2019s a serious issue. i\u2019m sure his friends and their partners would feel weird as well if they knew that. i definitely wouldn\u2019t want my partner jacking off to my friends, and i know my friends would be disgusted as well. plus he shouldn\u2019t have offered before talking to you. i don\u2019t blame him for fantasizing but he should have talked to you before offering and he shouldn\u2019t be jacking off to your friends pics???\n\nedit: i didn\u2019t know he actually admitted to thinking about cheating on you. you should probably just end the relationship honestly. i wouldn\u2019t be able to trust someone that would admit to wanting to cheat on me while simultaneously jacking off to my friends.", "NTA\n\nIf you aren't comfortable with people being in your house, you have the right to refuse them. \n\nI hope you and your bf can get better with therapy, but it sounds like he might have some sexual issues to work out if he's gonna be in a serious relationship.", "Look, my boyfriend did act on these impulses and we are in therapy but the trust is gone. It\u2019s already gone for you too. And it should be. But not because of the fantasizing, which is normal. But because of the huge marinara flag of him claiming he doesn\u2019t remember the conversation you had about boundaries. He also offered them a place to stay without speaking with you first. Those both show he does not respect you enough to warrant your trust. NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t stand up for yourself and enforce your boundaries.

Yes, it's an unreasonable request that no woman stay in your house EVER, when you allow men to visit, especially since these two are a couple. If you really mistrust your boyfriend that much, you should not be dating.", "ESH. I mean, the man is essentially letting you know he's fantasizing about cheating so he's most likely going to do it (if he hasn't already). However, if you're fine with him vocalizing that, I don't see why a friend and his gf spending the night is the final straw. That girl staying there or not isn't going to be the defining factor on whether he cheats/fantasizes. Now if you just don't want guests over for the night, then NTA, but if it's purely to stop him from acting on those fantasies, it's pointless.", "I\u2019m sure if the girl who was potentially staying knew she would find somewhere else. I would x x", "ESH for a couple of reasons. You: One: still staying with this guy who has zero self control. Two: Thinking that just because he is attracted to someone they will reciprocate. That is peak insecurity. This woman is someone else's romantic partner.

I would say NTA, as long as you decline to both of them not just his GF. But I would seriously consider just leaving the dude...", "Hes an asshole for already offering, than asking you.\n\nThis is a norma boundary.", "-----. Fantasies are not reality.

You might as well say he can't have friends of the opposite sex.\n\nEdit: Given the updated info, changing to NTA. That is pretty messed up. I wouldn't want them there either. Actually, I probably wouldn't even stick with this dude.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust your boyfriend, just break up.  \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me that you would continue a relationship and continue living with someone who you don\u2019t trust not to hook up with female houseguests.", "This is not how relationships function.  As awful as I feel saying it, it's toxic and abusive. \n\nYou should be able to leave females in your house with a SO and know nothing will happen.  \n\nI'm so sorry that you are going through this and I really hope you gather the strength to leave soon.", "He's not only fantasizing about other girls, he's masturbating to pictures of your girlfriends. He gaslights you saying you never had a conversation about no girls in the house, he's offering your shared space to others without consulting you first.

Still NTA but honestly you deserve better", "YTA to yourself for staying with a man you can\u2019t trust.\n\nYou say he fantasizes about the females in your lives, and masturbates to their photos.

This is not a good relationship. You deserve better.", "Commitment like denying you ever set this boundary? Commitment like agreeing to let this couple stay without talking to you? Commitment like refusing to withdraw the invite even though it makes you deeply uncomfortable?\n\nOr just, you know, Commitment to doing just enough to keep you quiet?", "Agreed, banning female visitors is not preventing him from looking at pictures or fantasizing\u2026 if things are to that state of him masturbating to her friend\u2019s photos we are well beyond healthy boundaries", "Sounds like you distrust is well founded based on additional information in the comments. Maybe time to live apart while he completes therapy?", "I\u2019m sorry but this begs the question - if you don\u2019t trust him, then why the hell are you even with him? ESH but you\u2019re definitely being an asshole to yourself.", "I think a better way to look at it is what is a boundary for you? Some people don\u2019t want their partners looking at porn. That\u2019s a boundary they can have but they can\u2019t tell their partner not to look at porn. They have to decide not to be in a relationship with that person if it\u2019s an issue. You can\u2019t control his thoughts. I myself have fantasized about past lovers or even friends while masturbating (in my head, not photos). If the photos feels like crossing a boundary to you I think that is an acceptable line to draw. It certainly feels more personal and I think that\u2019s understandable.\n\nWhere my bf crossed the line for was actively sexting and requesting videos, photos, etc from another person. This is a question solely for you and what you are comfortable with. If his actions cross your threshold, that\u2019s all you need to know. I would recommend individual therapy as well as couples. One of the things I have been working on individually is setting and maintaining boundaries and being comfortable enforcing them if/when the time comes. Your boyfriend gaslighting you about the conversation and inviting these people into your shared home without discussing it first are much bigger issues because it shows that regardless of what your needs are, he isn\u2019t going to respect them if it isn\u2019t convenient to him. And it is soooo easy to convince yourself that fantasizing isn\u2019t any different than looking at a photo isn\u2019t any different than sexting isn\u2019t any different from porn isn\u2019t any different from sexual video chats is any any different from physically cheating. If he can convince himself that it doesn\u2019t cross your boundary or that your boundary is irrational, he is not a respectful partner. Your needs could be completely ridiculous. They are still your needs. And you need a partner that is going to respect them. Acting like he didn\u2019t hear you when you\u2019re going to therapy for this exact reason, is a clear indication that he does not respect you and will lie if caught. He can tell you over and over he won\u2019t act on it, but his chance came to SHOW you he would respect your feelings and he didn\u2019t. And when you confronted him, he deflected and blamed you.", "Are you sure your in therapy with someone who is licensed. He is not normal. You are making yourself sound stupid.

Is your boyfriend happy?", "Serious question; if he acts out a fantasy in real life, say, follows a woman and jerks off while staking her, are you still \u2018safe\u2019 just because it did t happen in your home?

I think she should leave him, but it looks like she won't so... I guess just validate her minor attempts at setting boundaries to \"solve\" the issue.

She\u2019s got so little respect for herself that I don\u2019t see how anything can improve in her life even if she drops the chronic masturbator with so little control that he needs to be monitored like a puppy at all times.", "I think being secure and sure are two different thinfs", "well he did tell her he was thinking of cheating and he displays a lot of disturbing behaviors. if i was her, i would have left when she found out he was following a woman around in the supermarket? i would never look at my partner the same if they told me that.", "Girl, this is way more of an issue than couples therapy is going to fix. He needs extensive individual consoling (which I doubt he thinks he needs). \n\nIf you had a son, would you be proud of how he was acting if he acted like your bf? If you stay with him and end up having kids, that could a reality. \n\nHe clearly has a very skewed view of women and you\u2019re only feeding into that behavior by allowing it. Stopping women from staying at your place is just a band-aid and is almost blaming them. \u201cWell if they were there, he won\u2019t look\u201d.  No he\u2019s just human trash, he needs to work on a lot of things before he\u2019s capable of being a partner to anyone. \n\nHave some self worth and leave. Tell him exactly why and don\u2019t back down. Take your shit and GO", "He\u2019s lying to you. Wake up", "Let me guess: he told you that\u2019s what the two therapists said? In other words, you didn\u2019t hear it directly from the therapists themselves? \n\nHe\u2019s lying to you.", "No therapist should even use the term \u201cnormal.\u201d His behavior certainly is not healthy. But I do agree with these comments that he is lying to you. He doesn\u2019t see his behavior as an issue. You cannot force him to see it that way. \n\nYou only know what is being said in your couples counseling sessions but you have no idea what he is telling his personal therapists. It sounds to me like he is either not being forthcoming with them or with you. Either way, I think that tells you what you need to know.", ">Is fantasizing about everyone normal? Like not having a platonic friendship at all. I understand sexual thoughts can come into our minds and that is normal but I\u2019m just worried that the frequency in which it is happening is related to misogyny\n\nSo, \"normal\" isn't always easy to define. What therapists often look at is whether a thought pattern or behavior is having negative impacts on your life & the lives of those around you. In this case, the answer is clearly yes. It doesn't sound like fantasies about other people are just crossing his mind sometimes... you say \"he has been struggling with fantasizing about other people constantly including his friends and others - practically everyone.\" And he's already taken it to the level of following a woman around the supermarket. So it's negatively impacting him, and you, and STRANGERS that he sees in public places.\n\nBut what really puts it over the edge here is that he's not working to rebuild that trust by agreeing to your boundaries. If he hadn't said and done all the hurtful things he has said and done, I would say it was unreasonable not to let a couple stay with you. But given everything he has said and done, he needs to realize that rebuilding trust with you will mean making concessions to help you feel more comfortable. Even if he doesn't remember agreeing to them, and even if it means he has to have an awkward conversation to uninvite his friends.\n\nNTA and honestly I do hope you end things with this selfish & dangerous person but if you aren't ready to yet, at least stick to your boundaries and let him know they are the consequences of his actions and the price he has to pay if he sincerely wants to \"build trust\" with you again.", "Oh lord. Saying this as a mental health professional \u2014 it\u2019s not normal to the degree he\u2019s doing this. A fantasy in your head is one thing, to actively masturbate to pictures of women who haven\u2019t consented to him doing that? No. Not normal.", "Looking at some of your other comments it sounds almost like addictive behavior. I would see if he\u2019s willing to see an addiction counselor who will be much more pointed in asking about how often he does this, how often he watches porn, etc. Addiction is doing something you know will have a negative consequence and doing it anyway because you feel compelled to. That\u2019s what this sounds like to me. And it\u2019s only growing. I just saw he followed someone in the supermarket? It sounds like his compulsions are getting to a dangerous level beyond just damaging your relationship. Just because he is aware of the issue doesn\u2019t mean he can control the brain chemistry behind it. It\u2019s not an excuse for anything he does but he needs more directed counseling than a generalized therapist who isn\u2019t going to push the issue.", "I agree, it absolutely has - If you can\u2019t see that he\u2019s already starting down the path of acting on these fantasies by masterbating to your friends, then he\u2019s destroyed your self esteem. You deserve better than this. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not making progress in therapy. I\u2019m sure he is, but he needs to work on himself, alone, before entering or continuing a relationship. This isn\u2019t healthy, for him, for you or as a couple.", "I truly hope you are happy. You especially, more so than your bf. From reading your post history, though, I've got to be perfectly honest, I really don't see a way this can end well. I just hope you're thinking of your own happiness first right now.", "At the very least, you need to take a break from this guy and work on rebuilding your self esteem away from this relationship.", "If he's really set on changing wouldn't he remember an important conversation directly pertaining to the relationship issue?\n\nI don't know about anyone else, but I'm pretty sure someone who has predatory behavior with women he's near and genuinely wants to change, they wouldn't be offering women to stay at your place and would remember conversations about it. \n\nAlso did the couple ask to stay or did he offer for them to stay? Those are two very different things. It's also not hard to rescind the offer since they're probably still planning the trip. The longer he leaves it, the worse it'll be.", "Wow, that's horrible. She does need to get out.", "Or he\u2019s just lying to OP about what the therapists said.", "I think you should really reconsider being in a relationship with this man.", "you answered your own question. if he's thinking of cheating, he's already cheating. get out while you can.", "Yeah, consider just leaving this dude and let him have whoever he wants over. Fantasies are fantasies, but masturbating to your friends\u2019 photos? Nah... NTA", "Oh dear, time to go. I have never once heard of someone say \"I am thinking of cheating\" who either isn't a) already doing it, b) expecting their partner to green light it, c) using it as a manipulation tool to force their partner to do things they're not willing do or d) trying to break you down so you have no self esteem. Throw the whole man out. He's not loyal to you. It will not get better with a professional's help because he can't be counseled to develop integrity.", "It is black and white. You think he will cheat or you trust him. \n\nIf you don't trust him break up and find a partner you trust if you do trust him there should not be an issue.", "It is *black and white, you either trust him or you don't.\n\nJust break up with him please and YTA", "First of all, if this dude was smart he wouldn\u2019t have even said anything, you don\u2019t have to air all of your thoughts like that. Literally alot of people have fantasies, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to say anything about it especially if you\u2019re not gonna act on it or it\u2019s not hurting anyone \ud83e\udd28 so that\u2019s what I meant. He seems like a creep now that he said anything, he didn\u2019t even need to tell her all of that. Just my opinion \ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I get that I may be the minority.", "He clearly has no respect for women if he views every woman he sees as a sex toy! Normal men aren\u2019t so constantly horned up that they cannot be around other women, and jerking off to photos of your friends as opposed to porn or whatever is very, very questionable. Please have some respect for yourself and drop this bozo who honestly sounds like a predator that I wouldn\u2019t trust around literally any woman in my life.", "Lmao I didn\u2019t even see that part of him following somebody around a store. \n\nLike I said, just leave dude sucks anyway. Control isn\u2019t the way.", "I DIDN\u2019T EVEN SEE THAT. He is so fucking creepy omg. Thats like one step away from taking upskirt photos of strangers\u2026.", "Yeah I understand his dad is exactly like this. Very highly educated but can\u2019t stop gawking at other women. He also cheated (the dad). It is a very sad situation. His dad also called me hot in a thanksgiving dinner", "well he did say he was thinking about cheating, so it\u2019s understandable why she doesn\u2019t trust him. but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love him, she\u2019s trying and is even going to couples therapy with him. he sounds like he has some serious issues but she\u2019s still trying to make it work. life isn\u2019t black and white, everything is grey. all situations are different and maybe she wants to fight for this relationship. i definitely don\u2019t think she\u2019s TA though.\n\nedit: after reading further comments i hope she decides to leave this man. he is extremely unhealthy and displays a lot of predatory behavior. he needs therapy and she needs to leave.", "Ok I don\u2019t agree but I respect your opinion", "he openly admits to wanting to cheat on her so it\u2019s understanble why she can\u2019t trust him. he jacked off the pictures of her friends and fantasizes about his own friends girlfriends. it\u2019s one thing to have sexual fantasies but he doesn\u2019t really seem trustworthy from this standpoint.", "yeah she stated she\u2019s still with him because he\u2019s making progress in relationship therapy but i just don\u2019t see how a relationship can work after that", "right? i seriously don\u2019t know how she\u2019s stayed with him. at first i felt really bad for her and i still do but i also feel upset she chose to stay with this man when he was jacking off to pics of her friends? i would definitely cut her off if i was her friend and found out about this. he clearly needs help.", "You need to run a fast as you can!! \n\nBurning red flags EVERYWHERE!!!!!", "Doesn\u2019t sound sad like a sad situation at all to me. We\u2019re almost in 2023 and they\u2019re still pretending it\u2019s ok to act like that. That\u2019s not sad, that\u2019s straight up just misogyny, it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know any better. It\u2019s not 1950, they understand but they\u2019re choosing to disrespect women (and specifically you).\n\nIm giving you the benefit of the doubt that maybe you\u2019re young and insecure. Please take all of these comments to heart and stand up for yourself and leave. \n\nYou are the asshole if you continue this relationship. It is not your job to \u201cfix\u201d him. Leave his ass and let him fox himself. You can literally see what your future will behold of you stay with him. A cheating husband who you can\u2019t trust to even be in the same room as another women, and potentially a son that will not respect women.", "What did your boyfriend do when his dad said this?", "She said he fantasized about people in the OP, that's not thinking of cheating without intact to act on it.", "How can you respect that hogwash?", "Then trust him not to cheat or don\u2019t and break up. There is no relationship if there isn\u2019t trust.", "Yeah! I would definitely stop talking to her and damn sure would not support the relationship or any future they had together knowing that. He\u2019s got to be some kind of chronic masturbator or sex addict.

Being with a jabroni like that certainly won\u2019t help you. \n\nGet a therapist, do some work on yourself, and when the time is right a good man (assuming youre straight) who won\u2019t make you question your self worth will find his way into your life. You\u2019ll find someone that you can trust to be around your friends. \n\nYou have a whole great life you can live without him, but only YOU can take those steps for yourself. As cheesy as it sounds, find it in you to love yourself first, then the rest will follow.", "Did you ever think that you are insecure because he continues to tear you down? Leave and you\u2019ll see an improvement", "Even without all the other issues with your bf, for many women this alone would be enough to rethink the relationship.\n\nPlease get away from this man. He is a predator and it\u2019s only a matter of time before he cheats or God forbid, does something worse. Then go to individual therapy to work on your self esteem. I guarantee you in 20 years you will look back on this and be appalled that you stayed so long with a guy like this.", "No where in the OP does she say most of that. The only mentioned one is in an edit and it's the jacking off.\n\nWhich isn't cheating.\n\nEither she should break up or trust him and she clearly doesn't trust him.\n\nSo she should break up. As long as she's dating this guy and not trusting him she's ta, mostly to herself. Since following someone is straight up serial killer behavior", "I find relationship therapy is more to help better communicate to each other and discuss problems with an unbiased person to mediate. Therapy can\u2019t help build trust if there is none in the first place.", "she mentions them in the comments. he said he is thinking of cheating on her and that he followed a woman around in the supermarket. she also stated she\u2019s still with him because he\u2019s made a lot of progress. i don\u2019t agree that things are black and white but i do agree she should leave him because i wouldn\u2019t be able to trust someone like that."]}
