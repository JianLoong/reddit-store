Banning women from coming to your home for 6 months doesn\u2019t make sense as a solution , you can\u2019t follow him at work or anytime he leaves your home to make sure he\u2019s faithful?! Sounds like this is a bigger issue than houseguests and you need to really decide after all this time do you trust him or not", "NTA. Tell him it\u2019s fine if he (pretends not to) remember the convo about girls spending the night, but tell him you haven\u2019t and won\u2019t forget the convo that he fantasizes about everyone he knows.   \n\nWhich, is gross, you\u2019ve got much bigger issues than someone just sleeping on your couch honey.", "this is a weird one. esh yeah everyone fantasizes but he actually jacked off to pictures of your friends and admits he fantasizes about his friends girlfriends? that\u2019s a serious issue. i\u2019m sure his friends and their partners would feel weird as well if they knew that. i definitely wouldn\u2019t want my partner jacking off to my friends, and i know my friends would be disgusted as well. plus he shouldn\u2019t have offered before talking to you. i don\u2019t blame him for fantasizing but he should have talked to you before offering and he shouldn\u2019t be jacking off to your friends pics???\n\nedit: i didn\u2019t know he actually admitted to thinking about cheating on you. you should probably just end the relationship honestly. i wouldn\u2019t be able to trust someone that would admit to wanting to cheat on me while simultaneously jacking off to my friends.", "NTA\n\nIf you aren't comfortable with people being in your house, you have the right to refuse them. \n\nI hope you and your bf can get better with therapy, but it sounds like he might have some sexual issues to work out if he's gonna be in a serious relationship.", "Look, my boyfriend did act on these impulses and we are in therapy but the trust is gone. It\u2019s already gone for you too. And it should be. But not because of the fantasizing, which is normal. But because of the huge marinara flag of him claiming he doesn\u2019t remember the conversation you had about boundaries. He also offered them a place to stay without speaking with you first. Those both show he does not respect you enough to warrant your trust. NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t stand up for yourself and enforce your boundaries.

Yes, it's an unreasonable request that no woman stay in your house EVER, when you allow men to visit, especially since these two are a couple. If you really mistrust your boyfriend that much, you should not be dating.", "ESH. I mean, the man is essentially letting you know he's fantasizing about cheating so he's most likely going to do it (if he hasn't already). However, if you're fine with him vocalizing that, I don't see why a friend and his gf spending the night is the final straw. That girl staying there or not isn't going to be the defining factor on whether he cheats/fantasizes. Now if you just don't want guests over for the night, then NTA, but if it's purely to stop him from acting on those fantasies, it's pointless.", "I\u2019m sure if the girl who was potentially staying knew she would find somewhere else. I would x x", "ESH for a couple of reasons. You: One: still staying with this guy who has zero self control. Two: Thinking that just because he is attracted to someone they will reciprocate.

But I would seriously consider just leaving the dude...", "Hes an asshole for already offering, than asking you.\n\nThis is a norma boundary.", "-----. Fantasies are not reality.

You might as well say he can't have friends of the opposite sex.\n\nEdit: Given the updated info, changing to NTA. That is pretty messed up. I wouldn't want them there either. Actually, I probably wouldn't even stick with this dude.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust your boyfriend, just break up.  \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me that you would continue a relationship and continue living with someone who you don\u2019t trust not to hook up with female houseguests.", "This is not how relationships function.  As awful as I feel saying it, it's toxic and abusive. \n\nYou should be able to leave females in your house with a SO and know nothing will happen.  \n\nI'm so sorry that you are going through this and I really hope you gather the strength to leave soon.", "He's not only fantasizing about other girls, he's masturbating to pictures of your girlfriends. He gaslights you saying you never had a conversation about no girls in the house, he's offering your shared space to others without consulting you first.

Still NTA but honestly you deserve better", "YTA to yourself for staying with a man you can\u2019t trust.\n\nYou say he fantasizes about the females in your lives, and masturbates to their photos.

ESH but you\u2019re definitely being an asshole to yourself.", "I think a better way to look at it is what is a boundary for you? Some people don\u2019t want their partners looking at porn. That\u2019s a boundary they can have but they can\u2019t tell their partner not to look at porn. They have to decide not to be in a relationship with that person if it\u2019s an issue. You can\u2019t control his thoughts. I myself have fantasized about past lovers or even friends while masturbating (in my head, not photos). If the photos feels like crossing a boundary to you I think that is an acceptable line to draw. It certainly feels more personal and I think that\u2019s understandable.\n\nWhere my bf crossed the line for was actively sexting and requesting videos, photos, etc from another person. This is a question solely for you and what you are comfortable with. If his actions cross your threshold, that\u2019s all you need to know. I would recommend individual therapy as well as couples. One of the things I have been working on individually is setting and maintaining boundaries and being comfortable enforcing them if/when the time comes. Your boyfriend gaslighting you about the conversation and inviting these people into your shared home without discussing it first are much bigger issues because it shows that regardless of what your needs are, he isn\u2019t going to respect them if it isn\u2019t convenient to him. And it is soooo easy to convince yourself that fantasizing isn\u2019t any different than looking at a photo isn\u2019t any different than sexting isn\u2019t any different from porn isn\u2019t any different from sexual video chats is any any different from physically cheating. If he can convince himself that it doesn\u2019t cross your boundary or that your boundary is irrational, he is not a respectful partner. Your needs could be completely ridiculous. They are still your needs. And you need a partner that is going to respect them. Acting like he didn\u2019t hear you when you\u2019re going to therapy for this exact reason, is a clear indication that he does not respect you and will lie if caught. He can tell you over and over he won\u2019t act on it, but his chance came to SHOW you he would respect your feelings and he didn\u2019t. And when you confronted him, he deflected and blamed you.", "Are you sure your in therapy with someone who is licensed. He is not normal. You are making yourself sound stupid.

Is your boyfriend happy?", "Serious question; if he acts out a fantasy in real life, say, follows a woman and jerks off while staking her, are you still \u2018safe\u2019 just because it did t happen in your home?

He needs extensive individual consoling (which I doubt he thinks he needs). \n\nIf you had a son, would you be proud of how he was acting if he acted like your bf? If you stay with him and end up having kids, that could a reality. \n\nHe clearly has a very skewed view of women and you\u2019re only feeding into that behavior by allowing it. Stopping women from staying at your place is just a band-aid and is almost blaming them. \u201cWell if they were there, he won\u2019t look\u201d.

Like not having a platonic friendship at all. I understand sexual thoughts can come into our minds and that is normal but I\u2019m just worried that the frequency in which it is happening is related to misogyny\n\nSo, \"normal\" isn't always easy to define. What therapists often look at is whether a thought pattern or behavior is having negative impacts on your life & the lives of those around you. In this case, the answer is clearly yes. It doesn't sound like fantasies about other people are just crossing his mind sometimes... you say \"he has been struggling with fantasizing about other people constantly including his friends and others - practically everyone.\" And he's already taken it to the level of following a woman around the supermarket. So it's negatively impacting him, and you, and STRANGERS that he sees in public places.\n\nBut what really puts it over the edge here is that he's not working to rebuild that trust by agreeing to your boundaries. If he hadn't said and done all the hurtful things he has said and done, I would say it was unreasonable not to let a couple stay with you. But given everything he has said and done, he needs to realize that rebuilding trust with you will mean making concessions to help you feel more comfortable. Even if he doesn't remember agreeing to them, and even if it means he has to have an awkward conversation to uninvite his friends.\n\nNTA and honestly I do hope you end things with this selfish & dangerous person but if you aren't ready to yet, at least stick to your boundaries and let him know they are the consequences of his actions and the price he has to pay if he sincerely wants to \"build trust\" with you again.", "Oh lord. Saying this as a mental health professional \u2014 it\u2019s not normal to the degree he\u2019s doing this. A fantasy in your head is one thing, to actively masturbate to pictures of women who haven\u2019t consented to him doing that? No. Not normal.", "Looking at some of your other comments it sounds almost like addictive behavior. I would see if he\u2019s willing to see an addiction counselor who will be much more pointed in asking about how often he does this, how often he watches porn, etc. Addiction is doing something you know will have a negative consequence and doing it anyway because you feel compelled to. That\u2019s what this sounds like to me. And it\u2019s only growing. I just saw he followed someone in the supermarket? It sounds like his compulsions are getting to a dangerous level beyond just damaging your relationship. Just because he is aware of the issue doesn\u2019t mean he can control the brain chemistry behind it. It\u2019s not an excuse for anything he does but he needs more directed counseling than a generalized therapist who isn\u2019t going to push the issue.", "I agree, it absolutely has - If you can\u2019t see that he\u2019s already starting down the path of acting on these fantasies by masterbating to your friends, then he\u2019s destroyed your self esteem. You deserve better than this. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not making progress in therapy. I\u2019m sure he is, but he needs to work on himself, alone, before entering or continuing a relationship.

Those are two very different things. It's also not hard to rescind the offer since they're probably still planning the trip. The longer he leaves it, the worse it'll be.", "Wow, that's horrible.

He has made it pretty clear that he doesn\u2019t enjoy sex with you, he said he would be willing to do more foreplay with someone else, for Christ sake.\n\nOP, I know you want to fight this out, but I don\u2019t know if this relationship is tenable. He is a broken person and a predator, and you\u2019re trying to fix him. He can\u2019t be fixed. You need to DTMFA, move somewhere that he won\u2019t find you, and work on healing yourself. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re condoning and complicit in everything he is doing, because you see it harmful and are not putting a stop to it. Ask yourself this - if this was your friends bf, and you found out he had been beating the meat at pictures of you, or followed you into a grocery store - would you not be freaked out and feel unsafe? Would you not feel your friend is partially responsible for staying with her bf?\n\nHave a real good think on it.\n\nESH.", "NTA. But your Bf is a big fat one. You should leave this ass otherwise you support his creepy actions. Yikes.", "NTA, kick him out. Do it. Right now. Don\u2019t wait another second. Been there and done that, so I speak from experience. I stayed for far too long and put up with too much shit. \n\nYou need to learn to value yourself more, and being with someone like that will not help you do so. He will not change, so to give yourself some much needed peace just end it. It\u2019s NOT worth it. \n\nYou are still a young woman, you have so much time ahead of you to find someone who will treat you the way you deserve to be treated. Cut him loose and move on.", "Uhh... It sounds like the gf shouldn't stay at your place for her own protection", "YTA for staying in this \u2018realationship\u2019", "Have some self respect, JFC", "NTA but for dump him already, what are you doing???", "YTA for staying with this man but I still wouldn\u2019t want any female staying at a home he shares because he sounds like he\u2019s having huge issues controlling himself and I shudder to think what he\u2019ll advance too when he sees an opportunity", "ESH\n\n>and now I put him in a difficult situation because he already offered\n\nTell him he should have discussed it with you BEFORE offering as it is BOTH of your home.\n\nOr you could realise how creepy he is based on your comment history and get out of there asap. Seriously, why are you with someone who thinks it's okay to \"predatory follow a woman in a supermarket\"? Who openly admits to you that he's thinking about cheating on you?\n\nRelationship therapy clearly isn't working.", "Sweetie you have a boyfriend issue. His sexual issues and lack of control have nothing to do with other women. You can keep him from every woman on earth but clearly that doesn\u2019t stop his cravings. It\u2019s his behavior you\u2019re scared of\u2026so maybe let him go work through that with his therapist and take a break.", "NTA. You already had this conversation. You made yourself clear. The friends can stay at a hotel or b and b. That's what most people do. \n\nYour house is your castle. Your rules. He agreed to it.

There\u2019s no fixing this. ESH.", "Honestly?  You and bf are in different areas of what you want out of the physical relationship.  This will not end well for you.  NTA, but that is the least of your worries.", "NTA for having a boundary but my god you are being TA to yourself if you stay with this man, something bad is going to happen, keep clear of him asap and warn your friends about him and what he could do. Not to answer any messages from him and if they see him to run, use pepper spray or get to someone in a store who can help. This is more serious than you really see", "Imma be real honest here. Forget him break up he clearly doesn\u2019t respect you if he has \u2026THAT kind of problem that ain\u2019t normal..", "NTA he never should have offered to *anyone* without running it by you first.", "This is just hurt, a possible victim of SA, hurt doesn\u2019t quite describe it.", "Honestly going off the other comments sounds like cheating is nearly the least of the issues. Everyone will be very lucky if this guy doesn't attack someone.", "How do you feel safe at all with a man you say you cannot trust?", "The fuck?! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy are you with someone you don't trust?!", "i\u2019m sorry but if you don\u2019t trust the man you\u2019re dating why are you dating him? please you deserve better", "Is he in therapy on his own? Him masturbating to pics of your friends isn\u2019t a problem that involves you, it\u2019s all on him.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do what you want to do, but I\u2019d start making my distance away from him. He needs to work on himself before being able to be in a healthy relationship.\n\nAlso, what if one day he can\u2019t control his urges and forces himself on one of your friends?", "Of course he is secure. He has broken you down with his abuse to the point you don\u2019t care that he is an actual predator so long as you can pretend his sexist, creepy, and even outright violent behavior is happening out of your view. He knows you\u2019ll stay even if he goes to jail for his crimes, because he has crushed your sense of self, morals, and identity. It is hard for a man like that to find or create a willing victim/accomplice (you force your friends into contact with this creep!!!), and now that he has you set up to cover for, pay for, and otherwise support his predation of other women, why would he ever leave you? It\u2019s not like being with you limits his behavior in any way. \n\nI am deeply sorry for you in that you have become conditioned to tolerate this crap, but your self-delusion and comfort with his victimization of other women (hint: predation is not a fucking affair) is profoundly frustrating. \n\nGet out. It\u2019s the only path forward for you.", "Agreed! Not sure why they\u2019re hanging on, like this type of damage would just go away. Unfortunately I think this bridge was burned a while ago and they\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll work out.", "Surprised the therapist isn\u2019t saying the same as well.", "Don't forget *following random women*.

They deserve to know.", "What a nice and cozy life your bf has knowing that he can just steamroll over you and be rewarded with you excusing his behaviour for him.\n\nBit less fortunate for your friends though that this behaviour you're implicitly condoning is affecting them without their knowledge.\n\nBut hey,\n\nAt the end of the day all that matters is that your relationship stays *\"\"\"happy\"\"\"*, right?", "Haha true! He's secure because she isn't, and he knows she won't leave because of this kind of behavior.", "Oh he's totally lying. She just needs to warn all her friends and get out.", "Seems like with reason. DTMFA", "this is what I thought of immediately", "Homeboy tryin to set it up! Lol \n\nNTA but I would reconsider my relationship", "Nta for not wanting them to stay over. YTA for putting up with your creepy boyfriends perv behavior. Would you want to have a daughter with him?  What if he jerks off to your future daughter\u2019s friends?  He has major issues and I applaud therapy but you are not going to fix his problems", "NTA \n\nyou communicated your feelings and needs.

Either against someone you know or a stranger. \n\nINFO: Has he ever convinced/coerced you into performing acts with which you are uncomfortable?\n\nNTA but you will be much worse if he acts upon these thoughts with one of your friends. I'm assuming consent is not a consideration for him.", "NTA - This is heartbreaking to read through; looking at your post history, this has been going on for at least five months! OP, he's destroying you, don't put up with it, he doesn't love you, he honestly sounds dangerous. Get far away from him.", "NTA but please finally leave him. Just do it. Rip off the bandaid. You'll find someone else who treats you better and trust me, sex is better with people who actually enjoy foreplay too.", "Gross!  You don\u2019t trust your boyfriend and apparently there\u2019s good reason for that.  Otherwise I would say your \u201crule\u201d is super ridiculous because you both should be able to host short term guests after discussing it first.  Instead what is ridiculous is staying in a relationship with a man you don\u2019t trust.  YTA for that reason alone.  \n\nTreat yourself better!  Move out, get your own place and find a partner who respects you and isn\u2019t disgusting.

What the hell?", "He\u2019s going to keep pushing that boundary. If for some reason you stick around, expect him to start comparing you unfavorably to those friends.", "OP ----- GET OUT NOW.", "In this solely and specific scenario NTA, I think you are actually saving that girl from a nightmare (if there isn't a talk about sharing gf's or something like that you are not aware).\n\nBut, but, but YT-A to yourself and to your friends but keeping the creep around. The guy is a ra\\*e or a harrasment lawsuit about to happen anytime and you seem to be okay with that.\n\nIf you don't run you will have a shitty life because he will not change, and no therapy in the world can cure him.

You\u2019re in your mid twenties. There is a lifetime to find someone who isn\u2019t confiding in you about his sexual thoughts about other women. \n\nAnd I wrote that before I saw the bit about the masturbation.\n\nHonestly it has to be an ESH.

You don't have to manage his therapy for him. IMO, trying is not going to end up well for you. Not having women in your house is only a band-aid, and honestly I feel like telling you about masturbating over your friends and following a woman might be his way of trying to push to see how much of this behavior you'll put up with. If so, it's only going to escalate.", "Staying with this guy will only make your insecurities exponentially worse."]}
