We met while I was living in France as a young teen. After I moved back to the US we kept in touch and talked a lot. She was my best friend who I told literally everything to. We also visited each other often. After she graduated uni she moved to the US to my area\n\nSara is my closest and oldest friend and honestly, I understand why other women could be intimidated by her, but I\u2019m not willing to cut off a 11 year friendship for a woman I\u2019ve only been with for a few month.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my girlfriend Elle for 6 months. I do love her and do see a future with her. She is slightly intimidated by Sara, but as long as Sara and I don\u2019t speak in French to each other in front of Elle.\n\nSara\u2019s 24th birthday recently passed and I love birthdays. I love getting people gifts and I am well off enough to be able to get expensive gifts and this is something I always do for everyone.\n\nI attended Sara\u2019s birthday celebration with Elle as  my plus one.\n\nThe main gift I got her was something special to both of us. Sara has always been into botany and plants and has a small fruit garden of her own. Back in France we would occasionally visit Corsica where they grow clementines. As teenagers we would sneak out of her families house there find sneak in farms and steal them when they were ripe.\n\nSo what I did was find a way to contact that specific farm we would steal from, offered them a lot of money for a dwarf tree.\n\nI also wrote her a note, half in English and at the bottom had something I wanted only her to be able to read in French. Basically it was just talking about the good ole days back when we were young and dumb eating stolen clementines looking at the stars with each other and more words talking about our friendship and how special she is as a friend to me. \n\nSara loved the gift and note so much she cried reading it. So I thought I was doing good and got someone I care deeply for a gift she really loved. After Sara opened my gift she told me she was having a bad stomachache and asked me to take her home. When we got back to her place, she told me that my gift for Sara was too much and it was too intimate. I didn\u2019t understand, it was just something sentimental. \n\nElle said that the type of gift I got for Sara wasn\u2019t something a friend gets for another friend. I told her that me and Sara have been friends for almost half our lives so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate for me to go out for her. She said that she didn\u2019t like what I did and it was embarrassing as my girlfriend to watch me make another woman cry tears of joy because I care so much for her.\n\nI said it\u2019s just a friendship and she needs to not be so insecure about it and that I would do he same for her. We argued lightly and she told me I wouldn\u2019t get it and that I\u2019m being an asshole for not understanding her POV. I don\u2019t think I did anything at all wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702368740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gh2zi/aita_for_buying_an_expensive_gift_for_a_female/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or you might be afraid she rejects you I see. Hmm. Tough", "Are you sure you aren't in love with Sara?", "When you get into a romantic relationship, your other relationships, are going to change. There will be new boundaries that you have establish because you are now dating someone, you're literally sharing a life with them and they should be your no. 1 priority. You absolutely don't have to give up a friendship for your girlfriend, but the nature of your friendship will, and should, change. Maybe not just yet, since you've only been dating for 6 months, but sometime in the future for sure. You just have to accept that. So not an AH for bringing a thoughtful gift for Sara. But....\n\nTo me, it seems like while planning this whole gift for Sara, you had opportunities to tell Elle what you were planning, but chose not to. And then you even went as far as writing a secret message in French. If Elle had known this beforehand, she may not have felt as betrayed as she did. So if that's true, I think you were the AH in that sense. There needs to be transparency in the relationship. Especially because there was already tension between the two women.", "i'm curious when the two of you will get together... stop wasting people's time like that", "Special tree. From Europe. From special farm. Letter about watching stars together. In french. Dude you are lying to yourself and to your girlfriend.", "YTA in my opinion, but not for buying the tree.  You say you understand why women may be intimidated by Sara, but you say the only time that Elle feels intimidated is when you speak to her in French.  The fancy gift doesn't matter to me at all here, and I doubt thats what Elle was actually upset about.  You wrote something that crosses the ONE boundary that your girlfriend has, in order to talk secretly about how much you miss sitting and looking at the stars with her... Gee, it sounds like you KNEW that was crossing the line and thats why you said it in a language you knew she wouldn't be able to understand.  Furthermore, in your post you write that only because of the length of your friendship do you feel dating Sara would be out of the question, NOT because you just like her as a friend.  You clearly have romantic feelings towards Sara and you are NOT being realistic in thinking that others would be oblivious to that fact.", "How do the two of them get along? How does Sara treat her? Have you had a birthday with your gf yet? Have you gotten her anything for any holidays or anything. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get to here is do you treat Sara better than your gf. Or your gf better than Sara? Make your gf feel special and you won\u2019t have this issue I\u2019d bet.", "That\u2019s something her man should gift her. If I was her man, I wouldn\u2019t want a random guy as a third in the relationship.", "YTA. Buying the tree is a nice gesture and would've been okay. But you wrote a card, and the bit that makes her cry is on purpose in a language your girlfriend didn't understand, even though this gift should've come from both of you.", "INFO: have you given as thoughtful a gift to your girlfriend?", "So you\u2019ve definitely plowed Sara right?", "I\u2019m sure your girlfriend felt very loved watching you pour your heart into a gift for another woman. It\u2019s almost poetic, you know? Stealing clementines as teens, and now, seemingly stealing the comfort from your relationship. I don\u2019t know how to feel about this whole situation, it\u2019s kind of awkward.", "Just curious, was there a reason you never considered dating sara?", "Your gift was over-the-top sentimental, and you and Sara sound annoyingly cliquey.\n  \nThat doesn't necessarily make you an AH, but your total failure to understand how it makes your gf feel means YTA.", "NTA - But i can see why the GF was mad. That's a really thoughtful, intimate gift for a friend. TBH it sounds like you may be in love with Sara.", "You've heard a few different opinions in your comment section already so I'm going to draw attention to something else in your post. When you talk about how your partner feels about your relationship with Sara you use phrases \"intimidated by\" and \"insecure\", which places all the responsibility on them.\n\n>Sara is my closest and oldest friend and honestly, I understand why other women could be intimidated by her, but I\u2019m not willing to cut off a 11 year friendship for a woman I\u2019ve only been with for a few month.\n\nIt seems like you've stated pretty clearly which relationship is more important to you, since you describe Sara as your \"closest and oldest friend\" and your girlfriend as \"*a woman* you've only been with for a few months\", yet you end your post saying:\n\n>it\u2019s just a friendship and she needs to not be so insecure about it and that I would do he same for her\n\nSo...which one is it? Are they *actually* of equal importance? *Should* they be of equal importance? Just from these two bits of text I would justify Elle feeling weird about the amount of thought and care you put in your gift for Sara. That doesn't mean you should cut friends off left and right to make her feel better, but I find it hard to believe you can't understand her POV.", "i think the current opinions of male and female friendships are very sad tbh. You did a very lovely thing for an important friend, all the people saying it\u2019s because you are were or still are in love with her are silly.\n\nNTA in my opinion but I think next time maybe just give you gf a heads up.", "NTA. \n\nYou love Sara as a friend. If you both wanted to pursue a relationship, you would have by now. But you have Elle and you're happy. This is an Elle problem. She is insecure and jealous. \n\nI have friends that are as close as you and Sara are and I also have a partner of over a decade. My partner is not jealous of my relationship with close friends. In fact, she said it shows that I'm a really loyal and generous and loving friend. When my friends couldn't afford to visit, I would buy their plane tickets.", "NAH. Honestly? I can see Elle's point. In her shoes, I'd be thinking a) is there room for me in this person's life given Sara takes up a lot of space in your mind and b) am I ever going to be a priority. I'm not saying she's right and you're wrong, just that I can see where she's coming from.", "I'm gonna go with ESH.\n\nIt's understandable to want to make a thoughtful gift to a friend with whom you have such memories, regardless of their gender. That being said, you did cross the boundary Elle asked you not to: the French part of the note. Given the time needed for this gift to come to fruition, you could have warned your gf about the French part of it and sat down with her and explained/translated so that she wouldn't feel threatened or have her feelings hurt.\n\nOn her part, unless you or Sarah have given Elle reasons to feel the way she feels, her insecurities about you having a woman friend be this close to you is a problem she needs to work on, especially since you've only been together for six months.\n\nI think you could both use a moment to sit down and be open with each other if you really do love each other: six months is a really short time and it's very possible that you haven't had a chance to display that same level of care and thoughtfulness to her yet and that might leave her feeling like she's less important to you compared to Sarah even though technically she should be as much in a way because Elle is your girlfriend. \n\nFrom what your post gives off, Elle and Sarah don't seem to be at war with each other and Elle has made a reasonable demand (the French bit). She hasn't asked that you stop seeing her altogether or that you stop making thoughtful gifts. Again, had she been warned about the gift, her reaction could have been different. Offer her to spend quality time with her, ones where you can make lasting memories like you did with Sarah. Ask for Elle's input, do things together. She could also ask you what things you would like to do with her, make it a thing where the both of you actively participate and create memories.\n\nObviously, Sarah is your friend and your time together matters. But as your girlfriend, Elle doesn't necessarily feels threatened by who Sarah is but more likely feels like she has to catch up more for your relationship with her to weight as much as yours with Sarah (which is why I suggested making time to actively create memories with her).\n\nAlso, you've chosen this woman as your girlfriend. Unless she has thrown tantrums demanding you reevaluate your friendships and push them back at unreasonable distance or asked you to be less involved over trivial stuff, now is a good time to sit down and talk about boundaries regarding said friendships and expectations from this relationship if you both want it to last.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has a very good female friend aswell, it's always been tough trying to make your GF not jealous. But i've decided long ago that if a girl wants to be with me, she has to accept my friends. So good for you on your loyalty to your friends.", "NTA \n\nThat was a beautiful and thoughtful gift. Elle is jealous, insecure and wants to be the only woman in your life, friends included. It bothers her that you speak Sharas native tongue with her? Then why not learn the basics so you don\u2019t feel left out, instead of playing the victim, and making Sara feel like a villain? Naw, you gotta nip that in the butt early in a relationship cause if someone thinks they can \u201cget rid of\u201d your oldest and dearest friend, I guarantee you it won\u2019t stop there. \n\nElle doesn\u2019t give two \u201cpoops\u201d about Sara, she just wants her gone. You\u2019ve already said there\u2019s not a shot in hell that you would cut Sara out of your life for a partner, and I stand behind that 100%. Unless Ellie can get over her issues and accept Sarah is a part of your life, then this is gonna be an ongoing issue in your relationship. \n\nI recommend finding somebody less insecure, who respects Sara and cares enough about you, to not make you choose.", "I think it's a very good sign that you care so much for your friends! I could see the issue if you went all out for Sara but half-assed a gift for Ellie - but otherwise you can't diminish your friendships to appease her insecurity. You'll just end up resenting each other. NTA and what a wonderful gift.", "Lmao how yo girl mad over a damn tree \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA and I disagree with Elle - that isn\u2019t too personal a gift for a LIFELONG friend. She wouldn\u2019t feel that way if Sara was a dude.", "NTA really. I do think there is a lesson to be learnt here though. You should look at:\n\n\\-Comparatively how you treat Elle & Sara, they can both be important to you but make sure you aren't neglecting Elle for Saras benefit  \n\\- Did you tell Elle about your plans for the gift? not saying you should tell her what you're planning on spending or anything like that but you could have said 'Oh me and Sara used to steal clementines from this farm so I've bought her one of their clementine trees - just a little one obviously!'. This would stop her feeling blindisded.  \n\\- The note. I appreciate French is a widely spoken language but the fact that it was 50% English and 50% French makes it seem a lot more like you were expecting someone to try and read it (which would be odd) and you had secrets you wanted her to know and no one else (which would make most people feel insecure).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbsolutely don't bypass or throw your friendship to the side for someone you've been dating for 6 months but also know that you need to make the person you are dating feel like they're in a special little club with you not just a side character to your best friend. You already do this by not speaking in French together around her (which is also just basic manners).", "No woman is going to be okay with this friendship.", "Pas trou de balle.\n\nC'est que le d\u00e9but, attends toi \u00e0 ce que ta copine fasse tout son possible pour t'\u00e9carter de tes amies, dont Sarah.\n\nBon courage.", "NTA. But it\u2019s your responsibility to make your gf feel comfortable and secure with your relationship so she won\u2019t feel a certain way that would jeopardize your friendship with Sara.", "IDK ask her, if she would have been same amount of uppset for the gift if Sara was a boy? I think NTA. But some people are just more insecure.", "Insecurity and jealousy rearing its ugly little green head.", "nta - there are different forms of love...one is romantic love and then there friendship love that is unconditional and that  historic as yours with the best memories.  i think its amazing you did something so wonderful for your friend and your gf misinterprets that love u have for your friend as unrequited romantic love.  your gf needs to get over her jealousy and insecurity its not attractive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Basically, after her initial fears are answered honestly, you should make the effort to communicate your moves and motives clearly to keep those fears at bay.
