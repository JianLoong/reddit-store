You've only been with this guy for a year. He is not their dad, although he may become a stepdad in time. Mason's mum gets to be a proper grandmother as she is their actual grandmother. Alex's mother is not. She's the mother of their mum's boyfriend. She has no real connection to them. Even on this basis, you would be fine not allowing her to have them on her own just yet. Add in the medical needs, and you're absolutely justified. \n\nIf Alex isn't prepared to accept your boundaries when it comes to your children, I would question this relationship in the long run. He should be backing you on this, not his mother.", "NTA - Clearly she doesn't understand what no means and that alone is worrying enough.", "NTA. Huge red flag that she thinks she needs alone time to bond with them. That is someone who is selfish and putting her own needs first, and not thinking of the needs of children with medical considerations. And then she pressured her son into manipulating you too. Hell, I wouldn't trust someone like that with any children. \n\nI know you didn't ask, but your bf's stance on this is hugely concerning too.", "I mean it is def NTA - even if they didn't have medical issues she isn't their grandma and it is fine for you to decide who you want to watch your kids solo.\n\nThat said, if the issues is simply that you are concerned she doesn't understand their medical issues, couldn't you teach her about them?", "NTA\n\nThey are your kids, and it's amazing that you and your ex trust each other over the health issues of your children. You BF has only been your BF for 1 year, and even though his mom is probably full of good intentions, you still get to do whatever you want with your kids and it should be respected. These are boundaries to have with everyone including your parents and in-laws. If she is not willing to understand that don't make a big deal out of it, kind of ignore it, she wants to bond with them so it's not like she will shut you guys down. And your boyfriend doesn't have to give his opinion on the matter, especially as he is not caring for your children.\n\nStand on those boundaries, be firm and logic without being mean or insulting.", "NTA, and who cares what his friends think.   I would think long and hard before continuing a relationship with this d*ck.", "NTA, the simple fact is that while she may be a good mother (and don't be afraid to tell Alex that she is), looking after special needs children is a whole different ball game. Try to make a compromise and have days with you and her lookin lg after the kids until she's able to grasp the fact that it's not as simple as it is with looking after regular children. If she doesn't want to do what's needed to make you comfortable then she has no right to expect to be able to be left alone with them.\nI'm a little concerned about the jealous with the boys paternal grandmother. Does she not realise that of course Mason's mother will have a deeper relationship with her grandchildren than the mother of mom's partner?", "NTA - she's nothing to them and she's massively overstepping", "NTA Neither of them are listening. You aren't saying she's a bad mother or would be a bad grandmother (which she isn't a grandma but anyway). Your boys aren't the average baby and require more care. It should be on your timeline not hers.   \n\n\nGoing together would be a good compromise. You, her and the boys. Can you teach her how to care for their special needs?", "NTA - Mason's mom gets to be a grandmother because she is and is presumably trusted, and I would be really be put off by someone pushing for alone time with my child to the point of anyone fighting me about it. The boyfriend and the mother are not entitled to an opinion. I don't care your age or gender or relation, that feels like a red flag.\n\nI don't let my kids stay with their own grandmother alone because she has medical issues. If the kids have medical issues, that's even more important in a way. Trust your instincts, mom.", " NTA. Your BF and his mother are being selfish. They are worried that your ex\u2019s mom gets to be a \u201cproper grandmother\u201d instead of worrying about what is actually best for the children. If they were actually thinking about the kids (instead of being jealous), they would either accept what you have told them or offer to learn what they need to do in order to properly take bare of the children\u2019s medical issues. \n\nThis has nothing to do whether she is a good mother. This has everything to do with the unusual and exceptional needs your children have. Your BF and his mother need to stop thinking about themselves and understand this. The fact that they can\u2019t proves that they are not responsible enough to take care of your kids.", "NTA but why not go out with her, the kids, and just you and make sure she sees all the extra stuff you have to do?", "NTA at all. Mason\u2019s mom gets to be a proper grandma bc she is the Boys grandma and knows the medical routines! \n\nYou offered a very nice compromise and she won\u2019t take it.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYOU'RE the mother. They are YOUR children & only you & the father have a say on who the children are with. Especially since they are medically fragile.\n\nShe should have more respect for you & stop overstepping boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nYou absolutely have to do what's right for your children.\n\nBUT\n\nAt some point, would you be open to allowing your BFs mother to help you with the boys when you're together so you can show her what to do and that maybe ( if you're comfortable with it) that she might look after them for a while?\n\nAnd I'm not talking for hours and hours, just half an hour here and there in the park, if they're able to do that?\n\nUltimately it's down to you and if you're not comfortable leaving your children with her then there's nothing anyone can do.", "What do you mean by she doesn't understand the medical issue? Also, have you tried teaching her what needs to be done? Asking for better understanding...", "What I would do is if you both go out together, she probably doesn't think that your being serious, just an overbearing mother, it seems as though she does not believe that your little kids have a disability. NTA", "NTA. you are the mohter, and you know what is best for them. And if she dont understand the health problems of the boys, shs shouldent be able to look after them.", "NTA. But can\u2019t you teach her? Maybe let her do it on her own while you are there. Expand your circle of care options. Now if she doesn\u2019t respect or doesn\u2019t do what your kids need then for sure don\u2019t let her take them. But it could be worth a try to teach her.", "Your bf is a little boy who hasnt grown up yet and needs to go home to Mummy.", "NTA", "NTA. At the end of the day, they are your kids and she has no say in their lives. Your BF is, frankly, not their father either, so neither have no real say on the topic. You're prioritizing their comfort and care due to their medical necessities. \n\nThe only AH is your boyfriend and his mother. Again, he is not the father and she is not the grandmother. And frankly, if he isn't making any real effort to look after them properly while trying to force you to give them to his mother, I don't wanna say \"dump him.\" But that's a major issue and one that needs to be discussed. If he has this mindset now of prioritizing his mother's feelings over the safety of your kids, you should not continue the relationship.", "NTA.  Alex is prioritizing his mother's feelings over the safety of your children.  This should never have gotten to a level of an argument and I think those Red Flags Alex is waving shouldn't be ignored.

If he simply didn\u2019t understand, you could have an open conversation about your fears and doubts so he could get a better sense of your perspective. But instead of that, he\u2019s turning this into an argument and using some manipulative tactics to get you to give in.

Please be cautious letting your sons become close to those you're dating and their families.

Am gonna keep it simple. These are not small needs.. and they come above all. I get she wants to bond or spend time.. but you're the mother and if as thier mom you don't feel someone is ready to take on these responsibilities then best for you to stay on the course you are. In time when she learns what needs to be done you can probably leave them with her. Maybe you could try and teach her too but like i said if you're not comfortable as of now then you don't have to leave the kids with her.

NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re dealing with such heavy medical issues for your young kids. You sound like a really great mom who is just looking out for her babies\u2019 best interests. In this case, it\u2019s about not risking infection or a very real impending emergency room visit, life threatening stuff. \n\nYou offered a wonderful compromise, going together and teaching her what to do. Trust your instinct. \n\nI\u2019ve read way too many stories on here though, about old school family members risking kids\u2019 lives because they don\u2019t believe in the kids\u2019 diagnosis. Please proceed with caution. God forbid she doesn\u2019t believe that your kids have the issues they have, or as bad as they have, and tries to test those boundaries. It\u2019s too weird to me that she\u2019s uninterested in learning their care, and just wants to be alone with them. I\u2019m not trying to scare you, but I do think you should at least think about whether or not that could be a possibility. Be objective. Trust your instinct, that feeling you get in your gut.", "If she refuses to learn, that means she doesn't believe there's anything to learn, which means she doesn't believe they require any uncommon care at all. Definitely NTA.", "Kind of sounds like you need to re-evaluate this relationship\n\nMIL thinks she knows best even though she doesn't\n\nYour boyfriend defends that behavior\n\nTell him to go stay with his mommy for a while so she has a someone to take care of while you decide whether or not you want to continue dating him", "Yes she knows all their needs but I said it\u2019s alright knowing it but it\u2019s different actually having to do it. She said she didn\u2019t want me there when I suggested it just the boys", "What I mean is that the OP expressed a discomfort due to the care and the BF's mother isn't offering to learn herself. OP should not have to accommodate this by saying \"come learn.\" If the BF's mother truly wanted to be active and have the babies, she would actively do it. That's what I meant.", "Anytime someone balks at one of the parents being in attendance during a visit is the point where the Red Flags shouldn't be ignored.  There is absolutely no reason for someone not the parent to need 'alone time' with children.  As soon as she said she didn't want you there should be the time you say \"When you object to me being there during your time with my sons, all that tells me is that I can't trust you.\"", "So I have been in Alex's shoes more than a handful of times at this point in my (36m) life. \n\nThe first thing to understand is he's an idiot, and I don't mean that disparagingly, I mean it literally. He's 24 and trying to date a woman who has two young children, with needs he's likely never had any experience with, and probably is trying to over help in the relationship a lot. This is standard for us men who date young mothers. \n\nYou may be his first attempt at this and he has no clue about the complexity of parenthood, let alone the emotional stress raising kids takes on you. Add in the medical issues and he definitely doesn't have an idea of the daily fear you tamper down about their well-being. \n\nIt sounds like he needs an education on these matters and you're unfortunately his teacher. His reaction is defensive which implies he really does care for you and wants both you and your children in his life. Being firm and consistent about your boundaries will likely cause conflict in the future but it's needed if you want this relationship to work. \n\nIn the end I think his statement was a false flag and the real issue is that he is invested in the relationship and doesn't feel like you are on the same level because you don't trust him/his mom with your kids. Just my opinion though...", "Thank you. I never thought of it this way."]}
