James has a daughter Bex who was always the mean girl in school. She never bullied me personally. But my cousin Kayden and I, who is my best friend as well as my cousin, and I were friends with some of the kids she was evil to. Not to mention she was still a jerk to us. Just not as bad as she was to some others. She had a couple of kids she was friends with who were just like her. When my mom and James started dating I was upset that Bex was now part of the picture. I still didn't like her and I chose to continue spending more time with Kayden than her and didn't want to include her. My mom got annoyed by that especially after they had been married for over a year and we were getting older (like 10 or 11 at the time) and she stopped me spending time with Kayden (outside of school anyway) and insisted I be part of the family.\n\nAbout a year ago I told mom I no longer cared what she wanted and I would hang out with Kayden and spend time with him and avoid Bex and I didn't care what she felt about it. She argued with me and told me she was still my mom and I was her minor kid. I asked her if she was really going to ground me for it. She wanted me to compromise and I said no. I told her Bex is no friend of mine. She said she is family and I said not to me. That I really didn't care about her and it was about time mom learned to accept that.\n\nThe last maybe two months Bex has changed a bit. We're 17 now. She lost both her friends at the start of high school because they changed and she didn't. But then close to the end of school we were paired up in a class and she had nobody who wanted her. The one other kid who had no partner ran out crying because she'd bullied him and he realized she was the only one left. The teacher had to bribe one of the pairs to let her join. She asked Kayden and me but we both said no and she didn't push. Since that I think she has started to change. I also think her getting invited nowhere with no one to hang out with has been a realization for her. The fact kids are cold shouldering her now instead of trying to make her not bully them also added to her change I think.\n\nI spend most of my time with Kayden now that school is over and when I'm not with him I'm at work. My mom and James sat me down a few days ago and told me how Bex is lonely and really struggling and it's time we pull together as a family. I told them she is not my family and I don't care how lonely she is. She brought it on herself by being an ass to pretty much everyone and a bully to so many kids. I said they cannot expect me to have started to love her after seeing her be so evil to others. Out of all that the part where I said I didn't care that she was lonely angered them the most.

I know being lonely can lead to depression and can make people do really scary or stupid things. And I know it's not kind to care so little so that might be why I'm an asshole here. I feel like I would care if anyone else felt that way and it might be sort of a dick way to be.

Your mom married James but you didn't marry Bex nor you wanted her in your family. If she's bothered by Bex's lonelyness she can make plans with her, it's not your responsibility. \n\nBut, if she truly changes and I mean TRULY, then maybe you could be a bit nicer to her to show her that good behaviour gets her further than being a bully. It's up to you, merely a suggestion.", "Definitely NTA. The amount of times families get married and try to force their kids together in this sub is insane. Going as far as to punish you for not blindlessly following orders is pretty immature and gross of the adults in your life too. \n\nAlso, it's not like you have ever been outright mean to her, or went out of your way to tell *her* how much you dislike her. If you had, it would definitely be rude, but still would probably be not TA. \n\nThey can't force you to like her just because they fell in love and married. If she's not family to you, that's completely valid. She's kinda reaping what she sowed, and hopefully this painful experience helps her to mature and change so she can stop feeling so outcasted and lonely. Being that rejected definitely is painful, but no one can say it's undeserved. Her behavior has consequences and they are far beyond you and Kayden, you guys being friendly to her won't fix everything, and it's not your responsibility to do so either.", "NTA. Bex needs to understand that actions have consequences, and she needs to be accountable for those actions. Your Mom and step-dad have not helped matters by ignoring the root cause of Bex's bullying behaviour.", "NTA. Your mom and step father failed her as parents.", "NTA you reap what you sow. She has to deal with the consequences of her behavior. Just because you\u2019re \u201cfamily\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a instant relationship. Forcing one on you is just going to make you resentful. It sucks she feels lonely but she didn\u2019t care one bit how she made anyone else feel when bullying them. She\u2019s not your responsibility and she\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA actions have consequences", "NTA\n\nYour mother chose your step father but you didn\u2019t get to choose your step sister. It\u2019s unfair to say \u2018well she\u2019s family so you have to\u2019 when her being part of your family was forced upon you.\n\nIf she\u2019s changed and grown as a person then maybe try to speak to her, but if she\u2019s the same evil bully that\u2019s now just lonely then there\u2019s no point in keeping her company.", "NTA,\n\nShe has fucked around and found out. \n\nThis is all on her.\nYou keep doing your thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom and stepdad can't force you to see her as a sibling and the more they try the worse it will get. If your relationship hasn't improved in 9 years it isn't going to."]}
