I still didn't like her and I chose to continue spending more time with Kayden than her and didn't want to include her. My mom got annoyed by that especially after they had been married for over a year and we were getting older (like 10 or 11 at the time) and she stopped me spending time with Kayden (outside of school anyway) and insisted I be part of the family.\n\nAbout a year ago I told mom I no longer cared what she wanted and I would hang out with Kayden and spend time with him and avoid Bex and I didn't care what she felt about it. She argued with me and told me she was still my mom and I was her minor kid. I asked her if she was really going to ground me for it. She wanted me to compromise and I said no.

I told them she is not my family and I don't care how lonely she is. She brought it on herself by being an ass to pretty much everyone and a bully to so many kids. I said they cannot expect me to have started to love her after seeing her be so evil to others. Out of all that the part where I said I didn't care that she was lonely angered them the most.

It's not your responsibility to fix their mistakes. Even now, their attitude is \"Hey kid, can *you* do something about your step-sister's loneliness?\" Rather than \"Hey, maybe we should get her therapy or something.\" They need to do their job and stop expecting other people (including children) to manage her behaviour. \n\nAnd even if your parents had done everything right, Bex was still horrible to you and bullied so many other kids that no-one wanted to be her partner for a class, even when the teacher tried *bribing them.* How unlikeable must you be that the teacher has to bribe people to be your partner for one class?

If they had addressed your stepsister\u2019s bullying behavior when she was younger, instead of allowing her to be an insufferable AH for her entire childhood, she probably wouldn\u2019t be suffering the ostracism of her classmates now.  Just because the bullying wasn\u2019t happening in your home doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t their responsibility to deal with it.

Past it not being your responsibility, there's not actually anything you can do. Forcing yourself to hang out with someone you don't like, who has years of negative behavior, isn't going to fix anything. It will just make things worse for both of you. \n\nKayden is your family and frankly more of your family than Bex. Bex's dad should have dealt with her behavior years ago. Your mom would have to agree to fully pay for your college for you/four years of living expenses to even entertain this nonsense.

Less access for the bully to your time, energy, resources and personal information. You don't trust or want to be friendly with Bex because she weaponized the family relationship to harrass you and your friends. She's not entitled to your trust and friendship simply because \"you're family\" even as she has used this closeness to hurt you.\n\nIf you are civil and respectful in your interactions, you have done nothing wrong. \n\nMaybe if you give your mom specific examples of how Bex has hurt you over the years, with some focus on how she used her living in the same house to do it, your mom will understand that you can't trust Bex to respect your privacy and safety. But, your mom may be so invested in her image of a perfect blended family that she is blind to your needs, vulnerabilities and history of being attacked by Bex. \n\nThen, maintaining your boundaries is all the more important for your health and safety. You are a unique constellation of talents, traits, strengths and vulnerabilities. Each of your relationships is unique to the two people. Your relationship with Bex will be different than your mom's with her. That is normal.

Oh my God!  They are turning a blind eye to her behavior rather than come down on her about it.  Oh no, it's easier to come down on you about it.  They need to nip this in the bud and you need to tell them that.  Tell them they are LUCKY that no parents took it further with her to get her into serious trouble.

No, you can\u2019t always stop your kids from bullying but you can tell they didn\u2019t care because instead of trusting to get the step sister to change they stopped OP from having out with their actual friend.", "Its only been a little bit that she\u2019s \u201cshowing change\u201d and its only because no one like her and she is lonely. She is very likely pretending to be changed. A real change would be sincerely apologizing to all the people she bullied and finding out if she can do anything to heal all those relationships. She is not changed at all she has not apologized to any person she hurt not even OP for being a jerk to her for years. She is feeling the consequences of her own actions and its quite telling of how horrible she was that an ENTIRE SCHOOL wants nothing to do with her.", "The best thing for Bex is to go off to college (or get a job out of the house) and start over in a new environment. Hopefully she\u2019s learned from her past behavior. If she truly is sorry, owns up to her mistakes, and apologizes to you then you get to decide if you want to give her another chance or not. But that is your choice. And has she ever even apologized, anyway?\n\nGood luck, OP. NTA.", "That could happen. I would put nothing past Bex given how she has treated people the whole time I have known her.", "Sadly,  she may trick herself into believing she's changed or that she's the victim.  It sounds like your mom and her dad wanted to live in their own little world and expected you two to bond. \n\nWhile you overcame the challenges in your life, she probably started acting out for attention.  That's why I think she needs professional help. \n\nMany parents say they're just kids, they'll grow out of it. I find most child bullies grow up to be adult bullies. I hold the parents responsible for not teaching their children why bullying is wrong.  \n\nYou shouldn't be forced or pressured into helping her because her father didn't teach her why her behavior is wrong.  It's his mistake to fix not yours.", "Yes, my mom went to extremes to try and make that happen by trying to remove Kayden from my social life.

It's also wrong of your mom that she tried to keep you away from kayden just because Bex has no one. Well maybe if Bex was actually nice to people, you and kayden  might have been friends with her.", "NTA. If you ever decide you want to give it a try:\n - first, make sure you see actual change BEFORE even thinking about being friendly. successful therapy would show that.\n - second, establish firm boundaries, e.g. if you ever see her bully anyone, you are leaving her cold and they all know it is on her.\n\nPeople can change, but it is up to them to do so and make amends. They will need to bury their old patterns if they want a chance.", "NTA. Just because you are \"family\" doesn't mean you have to be friends.

IGNORE THEM  when they try to be passive aggressive about it and ask them if Bex is doing anything to get her own friends?", "I am amazed how parents will get remarried, and expect all the kids to suddenly get along and act like a family.
