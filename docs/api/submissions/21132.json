{"id": 21132, "submission_id": "14olwum", "title": "AITA for saying I don't care that mom's stepdaughter is lonely?", "selftext": "My mom got married to her husband James when I was 8. James has a daughter Bex who was always the mean girl in school. She never bullied me personally. But my cousin Kayden and I, who is my best friend as well as my cousin, and I were friends with some of the kids she was evil to. Not to mention she was still a jerk to us. Just not as bad as she was to some others. She had a couple of kids she was friends with who were just like her. When my mom and James started dating I was upset that Bex was now part of the picture. I still didn't like her and I chose to continue spending more time with Kayden than her and didn't want to include her. My mom got annoyed by that especially after they had been married for over a year and we were getting older (like 10 or 11 at the time) and she stopped me spending time with Kayden (outside of school anyway) and insisted I be part of the family.\n\nAbout a year ago I told mom I no longer cared what she wanted and I would hang out with Kayden and spend time with him and avoid Bex and I didn't care what she felt about it. She argued with me and told me she was still my mom and I was her minor kid. I asked her if she was really going to ground me for it. She wanted me to compromise and I said no. I told her Bex is no friend of mine. She said she is family and I said not to me. That I really didn't care about her and it was about time mom learned to accept that.\n\nThe last maybe two months Bex has changed a bit. We're 17 now. She lost both her friends at the start of high school because they changed and she didn't. But then close to the end of school we were paired up in a class and she had nobody who wanted her. The one other kid who had no partner ran out crying because she'd bullied him and he realized she was the only one left. The teacher had to bribe one of the pairs to let her join. She asked Kayden and me but we both said no and she didn't push. Since that I think she has started to change. I also think her getting invited nowhere with no one to hang out with has been a realization for her. The fact kids are cold shouldering her now instead of trying to make her not bully them also added to her change I think.\n\nI spend most of my time with Kayden now that school is over and when I'm not with him I'm at work. My mom and James sat me down a few days ago and told me how Bex is lonely and really struggling and it's time we pull together as a family. I told them she is not my family and I don't care how lonely she is. She brought it on herself by being an ass to pretty much everyone and a bully to so many kids. I said they cannot expect me to have started to love her after seeing her be so evil to others. Out of all that the part where I said I didn't care that she was lonely angered them the most. It led to several fights and I am still getting evil eyes and comments about it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688296857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14olwum/aita_for_saying_i_dont_care_that_moms/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know being lonely can lead to depression and can make people do really scary or stupid things. And I know it's not kind to care so little so that might be why I'm an asshole here.

Your mom married James but you didn't marry Bex nor you wanted her in your family. If she's bothered by Bex's lonelyness she can make plans with her, it's not your responsibility. \n\nBut, if she truly changes and I mean TRULY, then maybe you could be a bit nicer to her to show her that good behaviour gets her further than being a bully. It's up to you, merely a suggestion.", "Definitely NTA. The amount of times families get married and try to force their kids together in this sub is insane. Going as far as to punish you for not blindlessly following orders is pretty immature and gross of the adults in your life too. \n\nAlso, it's not like you have ever been outright mean to her, or went out of your way to tell *her* how much you dislike her. If you had, it would definitely be rude, but still would probably be not TA. \n\nThey can't force you to like her just because they fell in love and married. If she's not family to you, that's completely valid. She's kinda reaping what she sowed, and hopefully this painful experience helps her to mature and change so she can stop feeling so outcasted and lonely. Being that rejected definitely is painful, but no one can say it's undeserved. Her behavior has consequences and they are far beyond you and Kayden, you guys being friendly to her won't fix everything, and it's not your responsibility to do so either.", "NTA.

She has to deal with the consequences of her behavior. Just because you\u2019re \u201cfamily\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a instant relationship. Forcing one on you is just going to make you resentful. It sucks she feels lonely but she didn\u2019t care one bit how she made anyone else feel when bullying them.

Your mom and stepdad can't force you to see her as a sibling and the more they try the worse it will get. If your relationship hasn't improved in 9 years it isn't going to.", "It\u2019s interesting your mom and her husband are concerned that Bex is feeling isolated and lonely but didn\u2019t care that you felt threatened and upset when they merged their families. Your feeling weren\u2019t important, nor were the feelings of the kids she bullied. \n\nNow they\u2019re angry that you are responding to them EXACTLY as they and Bex did, by ignoring it and dismissing her feelings. The hypocrisy is pretty rich. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA and I am sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this.", "NTA. Well well well, if it isn\u2019t the consequence of your own actions Bex\n\nI absolutely hate when people try and force \u201cfamily\u201d on people. You are doing the right thing OP, you aren\u2019t bullying her or causing her further harm, just setting your own boundaries and sticking to them. I wish o and that about me at your age, would have saved me a load of trouble including following the \u201cfamily\u201d party line", "Why are your parents l lecturing you when they should have corrected Bex\u2019s behavior years ago? They failed big time. You\u2019re NTA.", "Nta. Bullies shouldn\u2019t get easily forgiven just cause they are sad  no one wants to be hurt by them anymore", "NTA\n\nIf she really changed she will find friends in time. Maybe in college or at work. \n\nIt's not your responsibility to provide her emotional comfort. Sucks that your mother doesn't understand this.", "NTA\n\nYou dont have to care about what your mom wants because she doesnt care what you want. She made it clearly when she decided to marry her husband. Tell her, she doesnt have a right to demand you compromise when she didnt take your opinion on her marriage", "NTA", "NTA, she fucked around and now is finding out Noone wants anything to do with her.", "NTA.", "NTA\nYou are not obligated to hang out with bullies, no matter what familial connection they have.", "NTA.   If your parents love her and want to help her, they'll put her in therapy and get her into another school for her last year so she has a chance for a fresh start.    \n\n\nThis is not your fault, nor your responsibility.  Maybe y'all can be friends someday, if she takes responsibility for her prior behaviors AND improves herself going forward, but that day is not today!", "NTA. May you try to explain to them that some lonely time is the only way for her to change and live a better life later? It\u2019s life-changing experience", "NTA.  Her father needs to get her professional help to deal with her issues.  Not expect you and your cousin to become her emotional support team after literal years of her bad behavior.", "YTA You should give her a chance if she is trying to change. Love doesn't come all at once. You may come to love her if you take time to get to know her. People change. I've seen many people I went to high school with and come to realize they aren't the people I thought they were.", "This. This is an agreement yes. \n\nThe whole We are family card does not help in this situations and should be null and void. \n\nLike basically how do you expect your children to basically start being friends with a total bully and even if they have not bullied the children themselves they bullied others so that's a no on every front. \n\nAnd also honestly what the mom did at first like basically forbidding her child from spending time with her cousin/best friend is super wrong because you can't force a child to be friends with someone especially the whole reasons of Opie's post and what I said. \n\nO p so NTA. A\n\nAlso honestly didn't the parents do anything to curb your stepsisters Behavior early on or did they expect you to be the angel that will save her from herself?", "\"I am not her emotional support animal.

But her past behavior has ruined any chance she has to have a relationship with me and you need to respect that.\"", "Mom was never really her parent. I think she tried to be but Bex was adamantly against it. Still, as a parent she definitely failed by her reactions to me over the years and she could have done more to get James to do more with his daughter. They both wanted their happy life though.", "I think she has changed but it's not enough to where I want a relationship with her now. She's still someone I dislike/hate and want no part of having in my life.", "It really shows that their priority was always living as happily as they could and wanted everyone to play along.", "I was going to bring up the \u201cfamily\u201d thing. It\u2019s a BS argument. And if they use it, they\u2019ve already lost the entire case. If somebody comes up with \u201cfamily\u201d the proper answer is: \u201cSo are we the mafia now?\u201d", "Because correcting the behavior would\u2019ve taken actual effort and parenting, can\u2019t have that. Better to take the easy way out and have teenagers clean up your mistakes.", "There's also the thing that forgiveness doesn't mean a relationship will form after. But yeah, can't force forgiveness any more than you can force love.", "I like how you worded this!!! Very apt!", "Frankly I'd tell the two parents that you're going to go up one day soon and will get to chose who you'll have in your life. Adult estrangement is not uncommon. This is surely the path to LC or NC.", "Then just tell that to your parents. Tell them that even if you didn\u2019t know her beforehand, she would still be shitty to be around. They can try keeping her company so they can understand", "She may only be pretending to change to get sympathy.  She may be hoping you'll let her hang out with you so she can get your friend to be hers.  Then she'll likely revert back to being a bully and drive a wedge between you and your friends. She probably isn't thinking that far ahead but this is similar to something that happened to me. \n\nShe'll be grateful at first and then probably revert to her true self.  \n\nBut she could have learned her lesson and has changed.  But that doesn't mean your mother and her father should expect you to hang out with her after years of putting up with her behavior. \n\nShe needs professional help dealing with her issues.", "They wanted everyone to live according to their happy fantasy and when both of you didn\u2019t conform your mother thought that she could manipulate you into becoming friends and loving her because she sees you as the most reasonable of the two."]}
