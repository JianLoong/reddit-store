My SIL, who excuses her children's behavior, asked if her sons could come so they could see their cousins and I said no.

You get to invite who you want to any event.  This is a special event for you and you don't want it ruined.  SIL is the AH for insisting that she be allowed to bring someone who is not invited.  Thank you for your service.", "NTA. If SIL wants her kids to be able to attend things, she needs to teach them manners so people actually want to invite them. If they're as awful as you described, I have no doubts that she's starting to see her kids left out of more and more things as no one wants to tolerate their crappy behavior. And it's not your fault for not wanting your event ruined, it's the parents' fault for not managing their kids' behavior.", "NTA. If they couldn\u2019t behave at a small, informal family gathering, then the chances of them behaving at a large event where they have to sit still and be quiet for more than 5 minutes are very slim. Especially at a military function where there are people who aren\u2019t used to rambunctious children and who could potentially be important in the military world. I wouldn\u2019t want my children there because they\u2019d be bored to tears. Tell your SIL that it\u2019s not a fun event where they play games and people are running around and playing loud music and ask if she genuinely believes that her kids won\u2019t get upset if someone tells them to pipe down and sit still because they\u2019re aggravating them.", "NTA People like your brother and SiL will never hold their kids accountable or acknowledge their part in this crap show. Better to simply avoid the disaster", "Nope, NTA. This wasn't just some party, it was an important milestone for you. The nephews have already  demonstrated they cannot behave and have lost their privileges. They sound like a nightmare!", "NTA. Your nephews are well past the age where children should be able to self-regulate their behavior. Unless your brother has a come-to-jesus moment and starts disciplining them, they are barreling headlong into trouble.", "NTA you sil is just upset that her terrible chickens are coming home to roost. Personal accountability may be going by the wayside but it is hardly a strange standard for a military retirement. They are lucky that you don\u2019t go drill sgt on them.", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA people need to understand that you may want to allow your children to run wild and not respect other however when you do this others will not want them around. They will not want to put up with them and thier attitude. Plus who wants to be embarrassed by family at this time. Your actions have consequences. No disciplining your children  and teaching them respect has the consequences of people not wanting them in their homes or at important events.", "NTA. However, for better or worst, I would probably be honest (in a best diplomatic way) with your brother about the reasons behind your request, and just stick to the fact (a. k. a room mayhem, stressing you...), because at one point they will ask again, and again... So you will have to deal with the issue at some point. Obviously don't call the kids names or tell him what you think of his parental skills... Probably not a great idea, but maybe worth a thought.", "Absolutely NTA and thank you for your service. Unfortunately manners start at home and other than excluding them there is not much you can do.", "NTA , feral kids should stay in the wild where they belong with their useless parents.", "NTA.\n\nNot even a little bit.  Having attended one of those ceremonies myself, it can be on the formal side (at least my Dad's send off was).  If your nephews can't behave then no.  They don't have to be a part of it.", "Most definitely NTA you need to put your foot down  with your brother and tell him and your SIL until thier children learn manners they will not be invited .\nThere is no excuse for the atrocious behavior of those 2 kids..\n\nOnly AH'S here is your brother ,your SIL and those kids", "NTA. Wouldn\u2019t matter if they were the best behaved children on the planet. You can still prefer a more mature retirement event. The fact that they\u2019re so ill-behaved just gives you more of a reason to not invite your nephews. If your brother & SIL could find or pay a sitter then your SIL should\u2019ve offered to stay home so your brother could celebrate with you.", "NTA. Your sister in law is a shameful enabler. Don\u2019t invite them.", "NTA\n\nTell them that free range kids are not invited.", "NTA and congrats at retiring at 45.", "NTA, they're just getting the consequence of not teaching their kids to respect other people and their things.", "My moms boyfriend kid was a horror. I was horrified when I realized he would be there when I was send off to camp and with good reason. I was known as the kid with the crazy little brother even though we weren\u2019t even related.

They would destroy it\u2026", "NTA- don\u2019t invite SIL either", "NTA: Why is it always the worst parents who want to impose their children on the life of others?", "NTA. Two of my kids are autistic and I am never offended when people find their behavior too disruptive to attend events. It's not unusual to restrict formal events like a retirement party to teens and events because little kids with or without disabilities are just too chaotic. I would suggest setting up some other time for the cousins to meet up, though. Even if you don't like your nephews your kids may want to maintain a relationship with extended family. But there is absolutely no reason it has to be at your retirement party, SIL should respect that the event is for the 13+ crowd and just meet at a park some other day.", "NTA. You have no obligation to invite these creatures. If your brother and SIL have such an issue with this, they can skip the event too.", "NTA,", "Sometimes I am grateful that my mom was strict with everyone.

I'm guessing it probably also goes further than just family. At 8 and 10, they're old enough to have been invited to things like classmates' birthday parties a few times. And if they behaved the same way at those events as they have at your home, I'm betting they aren't getting very many of those invites either because they consistently ruin things with bad behavior.\n\nIt's sad for the kids to be excluded all the time, but there's a fix to it. Teach them manners.", "On the topic of ages, what age were the kids when nephews made yours cry by messing up their room? There's quite an age gap, if your kids were around 8/9 then these nephews would've been 2/3 and making a mess is not really shocking behaviour. If your kids were their current \"older teen\" age then it sounds like everybody could use a bit of help with emotional regulation?", "HAHA right?", "A valid point, except that's not what he's doing.. he's specifically not inviting them. He's discluding them. He isn't trying to guide them in a different direction or teach them by example what good behavior looks like the kids aren't going to be able to differentiate. They don't understand that they're Tiny Monsters. They'll just think their Uncle hates them. Children don't get the nuance. And they're not going to remember and pick up on it as adults.. they're only going to remember how he made them feel.", "If brother & SIL want to take kids to events, they need to teach them to behave or sit on top of them the whole time.", "Amen and thank you!
