I wouldn't want them there either.", "It\u2019s good that you cleared it up before they just showed up uninvited. \n\nNTA \n\nYou might have caused a rift though.", "NTA!!!!", "NTA, and you should mail her pamphlets for military boarding schools.", "NTA, if it isn't your brother receiving the consequences to his own actions", "NTA - those kids need to get used to being excluded if they are continuing to act this way.", "Twenty-ish ago, when my dad retired, I was the same age as your older nephew and my younger sister was the same age as the younger. We knew how to behave ourselves and not interrupt an important ceremony and function for him and his unit. If I, or any of my siblings, had acted the way you describe their actions, we'd likely have been left at our grandmother's house for the duration of the event. And lord help us if we'd been taken along and acted up during it.  \nImportant events, which include retirement ceremonies, require a certain level of decorum. Your nephews have repeatedly and flagrantly shown they cannot maintain that decorum and their parents have shown that they are unwilling or unable to modulate the bad behavior. In this light, it's easy to say that you're completely in the right. The fact that it's your own retirement ceremony makes it even more so. NTA.", "I mean\u2026 it\u2019s your party and you can invite who you want. Framing it as wanting older teens and adults only makes you NTA, as you are not specifically excluding these two kids.\n\nYou\u2019ve had these kids over twice in three years, so their ages at that time would have ranged 5-10. Refusing to eat a meal but still wanting dessert, and even throwing toys are developmentally normal things. Annoying, yes, but these don\u2019t sound like nightmare children. They just sound like children.\n\nYou sound overly harsh and like you have unreasonable expectations of kids.", "My husband and I had friends when we were younger who let their boys run wild. They would come over and dump all of my son's Legos,  puzzles and empty his toy box. Then they would leave. My son would be so sad \n\nOne day I said. Hey boys you need to help clean up your mess. Their mom went up to supervise. In a bit she and they came down. They left. My son started to cry. I went up and if they picked something up, I have no idea what.\n\nAfter that.we always had plans when they wanted to get together.", "NTA. No way would I have those two at a military retirement ceremony. I don't know what branch you are or how yours are run but the retirement ceremonies I have been to have been suuuuuper laid back compared to the big blue version of doing it. Even then misbehaved children would not be welcome. Your SIL would probably get super offended when someone would ask her to leave with the kids in the middle of it. Congratulations on the retirement!", "This is where an intervention could be helpful. The idea behind an intervention for an alcoholic family member is because the alcoholic can ignore one or two people but find it difficult to do the same in a large group. Be kind and show them you\u2019re on their side and willing to help in any way you can but you can\u2019t allow blatant disrespect for your children and your home. If they\u2019re this bad in a public situation I can\u2019t even imagine how they are at home. I can\u2019t see them having friends as kids their own age aren\u2019t comfortable around them as they\u2019ve been taught respect and basic manners and they know it\u2019s wrong. Their parents have to know this is happening. They may see it as an ambush at first but they will have to think about it.\n\nGet with your family and see if they\u2019re willing to help and take it from there.\n\nEdit: Thank you for your years of service.\n\nEdit: judgement NTA", "That is an excellent idea.", "I like you. Can I borrow your taser for my niece and nephew? lol", "Zap \u26a1\ufe0f", "I agree.

Some of those kids don't behave for their own parents.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou should recommend a nice preteen boot camp for those nephew hellions", "NTA. Before you mentioned having your own kids, I thought you might be someone who isn't familiar with what kids are like. But since you have kids of your own, you have likely been around lots of kids and can actually distinguish between what is bratty and what is normal childish behavior. You don't have to subject yourself to bratty behavior on your big day. SIL is the cruel one for raising bratty kids.", "NTA, uninvite your brother and SIL.", "NTA, they'll be forced to reckon with their lack of parenting at some point, but you aren't obligated to sacrifice such an important event for that!", "\"My brother and I were taught discipline and respect.\" \n\nThis line sounds ominous and foreboding to me. I wonder what your childhood was actually like? It doesn't seem like your brother thinks it was as good as you think it was. He certainly doesn't want to raise his own children that way.\n\nBut that is not the point. You have embraced an orderly life that focuses on discipline and respect. And this party is about you and not the kids. This one time, I think you are NTA to exclude your nephews. \n\nThough I hope in the future you could discuss boundaries with your brother and SIL that would offer a path to including the nephews in your life. If they are in your home they should be able to behave respectfully. But I hope you don't shun them because they disappointed you when they were younger.", "NTA. Just not the appropriate place for those kiddos right now.", "NTA. Your event, your rules. If your brother and his wife want their children to be welcome, they should have better behaved children.", "You don't ever have to invite anyone you don't want to. People that lost it over this have crappy boundaries and want the rest of us to pay that. If SIL wants her sons included she can start doing the work of raising them. \n\nCongratulations on your retirement!", "NTA you're perfectly justified to do this. It's awkward but they're clearly in denial with their kids.\n\nWord of warning though: they might still try and show up with the children. I've seen it happen alot on here.", "NTA not your circus, not your monkeys.", "First off,  Thank you. \n\nNTA. \n\nWhy do i want you to invite them and then have two military soldiers ready to haul them out by the back of their jackets when they act up, SIL too if needed. It looks so\u2026.  in my head.", "NTA. They're reaping what they sowed. And congratulations!", "NTA.  They sound insufferable.

They are for refusing to control their own children.", "NTA", "Retired\u2026not ex", "NTA - She can stay home too, if she doesn\u2019t like your rule, for your special event.\n\nAlso, thank you for your sacrifices \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA and thank you for your service. \n\nBut yes definitely not a asshole. Protect your kids, home, and sanity.", "NTA when you have ill behaved children it\u2019s expected that you don\u2019t get invited anywhere", "NTA. Your event, your rules!\n\nIt'd take me quite a while to forgive anyone who genuinely upset my kids.", "NTA fuck them kids", "NTA.

Your party, your rules.", "NTA - your brother and SIL need to learn \u2018you reap what you sow\u2019 \n\nThey sowed uncontrollable kids so they can reap no invitations", "I wanted to tell you that if you make a rule which \"accidentally\" excludes the unwanted, then you are not helping them long term. They will create a different viewpoint and count this as an unfortunate accidental thing. Please tell them that this is a formal environment, and they cannot come because of past behavior. This way they cannot sugarcoat that they are exculded, and have a real chance to improve. Ofc be diplomatic :)", "is that where that is from? my brother was in the army and he would say \"duly noted,\" in response to my complaints ha.", "And will live at home because no one will date them.", "*excluding", "Is there a difference?", "My parents were like your brother and SIL so when I was a kid I didn\u2019t learn pro-social behaviours. I had few friends and the few I did have I had trouble keeping. It absolutely contributed to my anxiety and depression as an adult and it\u2019s meant I\u2019ve had to struggle to learn all those social skills I should have learnt as a child as an adult. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cthey\u2019re old enough to know how to behave\u201d but when the parents are constantly reinforcing that they\u2019re not the problem, kids get confused. \n\nSo from the perspective of a now adult with parents like this, and a teacher who works with these kind of kids with kindness, if you\u2019re going to have an intervention, focus on how a lack of boundaries can negatively affect children in the long term (there\u2019s tons of research on this and plenty in layman\u2019s terms). Make concern for the children central and approach with compassion. And if their parents still refuse to do anything, then the rest of the family and agree on boundaries that will be set and enforced by everyone else. Kids are adaptable and will quickly learn that they can\u2019t get away with this behaviour with the rest of the family.", "Yes!! Retired means he dedicated his entire career to the military. Ex-military is used when someone enlists and leaves before they\u2019re eligible to retire. Except in the case of Marines. Once a Marine, always a Marine!!", "Ah, I'm from the UK. We'd generally use ex-military for both. But then you used to become eligible to retire at 22 years service (so 38-45 for most people) which meant most \"retired\" service men still had 20 odd years left until retirement age.\n\nThere was a trick to get 22 years in the military then 20 years in the civil service and you end up with a retirement income higher than any job you were paid to do.\n\nThey somewhat recently broke this by moving both schemes to 30 years until full benefit", "NTA. Maybe if fewer invites went to nephews, parents would realize their behavior is the issue.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t want bad ass kids around embarrassing you at an event that\u2019s understandable. I don\u2019t like when parents don\u2019t teach their kids how to behave in public especially at your nephews ages.", "Nope. NTA. When the bratty kids learn proper behavior, they may be able to be invited places again. Also, props to you for not dismissing your kids feelings. Too many parents allow their own children to be disrespected, in order to be a gracious host.", "NTA - SIL knows her children are badly behaved and thinks it has been overlooked.\n\nYou saw the problem, didn't watch it race towards you without doing something to stop it.  \n\nGlad you enjoy your day without their drama", "Once you\u2019re in the military it\u2019s retired (if you hit retirement) or if you don\u2019t hit retirement there\u2019s not really a convenient term.

On a day I was starting to feel a little better, I had a bit of a clean-up of the living room - tidying away my and my OH's crap, sorting out my little table next to the sofa with my meds on, and I even ran the hoover over the carpet. What would have taken me 10 mins on a normal day took me over an hour, and wiped me out. But I felt such a sense of achievement!\n\nMy OH came home, said 'Oh, you've been busy! Well done!' then proceeded to throw his jacket over the living room chair, kick his shoes off to stay where they landed, then open his mail and leave the envelopes on the floor.\n\nI cried almost until I was on the verge of vomiting.", "I know for the Marine Corps it\u2019s 20-25 years for retirement, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s the same across all branches here so the age range is still right about the same."]}
