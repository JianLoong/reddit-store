Exactly how are you supposed to cultivate a relationship? It's one thing to be a free spirit, but he's kind of an asshole for failing to communicate with you throughout these years.  At this point, she's not the only one that's a stranger....he is too.", "NTA. \n\nI get your point, you don't even know this girl. You're not an ass for not knowing her. Hopefully they will be together a long time, probably worth while to make some effort. Why not invite her to go shopping or whatever, can't hurt.", "NTA in a general sense, you can't force a relationship. However, reading between the lines (I know, classic reddit maneuver lol), it appears like you tend to harbor resentment towards people who remind you too much of your ex, at least a teensy bit. I'm not so sure that's such a great thing.", "NTA, but that's not really the point. If your goal is more contact with your son, this isn't how you're going to get it. You can welcome and include her without being really bonded; that is what's more likely to get you what you want. Don't complain that you're not super connected with him if you're not connecting with her", "NTA. Your son sounds emotionally immature, unrealistic and spoiled. \nAre you prepared to support them? I ask because traveling to new and exotic places for \u201cvolunteer\u201d work is gonna be crazy hard with a newborn. I foresee them showing up months or weeks after her due date because they can\u2019t manage the responsibility of raising a fresh baby on the road. \nBest of luck. I hope I\u2019m wrong and he turns out to be a great dad that finds the means to support his family. But in the meantime I would start thinking ahead about how you\u2019re gonna handle it if he doesn\u2019t. I doubt he is.", "I'm going to say NTA \nBut it seems you may be projecting your frustrations and disdain for your sons disconnect with you into her.  Almost as you somewhat hold her responsible for his behaviors? \n\nMy next question would be,  do you hope to have a relationship with your grandchild? \nIf so,  I suggest putting your feelings aside and try to bond.  Why not invite her out just you and her but your with your friends?", "Might be unpopular but.\n\nNAH.\n\nI understand where your son is coming from. He wants you to like his fiancee so no future disputes would happen. Also he wasn't really obligated to call you often. Sure it would have been nice but its not an obligation(A heads up would have made you a slight ass though for not putting in effort)\n\nI also understand you. Your son just shows back up with this random girl and expects you to bond with her in a short amount of time. Also the lack of communication probably didn't help  his case\n\nUltimately your son's fiancee don't even need to get along. Just be cordial.", "Ummmm I'm gonna say NTA. \nIn an ideal world you'd love her. But you can't force your feelings. As long as you're not being openly hostile, it's not your fault, or hers, that you're different people. \nI'd just say though, for the long run, I'd try and invite her to as much as you can while she's with you. Just because if they do come back, she's probably going to be the one who facilitates the relationship with your grandchild. Sounds awful but in most cases it's true.", "Nah. If you want to ensure your sons and future grandchild\u2019s continued and enthusiastic presence in your life\u2026 do try to be inclusive. As you said, you don\u2019t and won\u2019t see them often.", "Generally speaking, NTA. You don't sound like you're going out of her way to be unpleasant to her, and (given the information we have from you alone), he sounds rather inconsiderate. \n\nAll that being said, if you still want him in your life, and especially if you ever want to see your grandkids and have a relationship with them, I'd recommend trying to at least do a couple of things with the new gal before they leave. It's up to you, and I wouldn't call you AH if you didn't, but it's worth mentioning. Good luck.", "NTA. What a shock. All I would say is that if there are not going to stay that long then it should not be too much to do 1 or 2 things with her so that at least you can look back and know you did your best to make her feel welcome. I mean no-one can expect you to become BFF just like that. In any case, life with a child is soon going to give them a massive reality check, particularly when it comes to travelling. The irony, is that one day he will probably find himself in the same situation as you.", "NAH - He wants you to love who he loves and bond with her. But the reality is you haven't had the time to 'click' or find anything in common, and you are still reeling from his \"surprise\".\n\nI would seriously suggest trying to find some common ground with her, being super nice and easy going with her. Basically the socialized version of 'bonding'. She is your sons love and the mother of your grandchild, and at the end of the day you need to be civil and get along politely with each other for numerous reasons.", "NTA", "If you ever hope to maintain a good relationship with your son and possibly get to know your grandchild one day, you need to look into the future. It's likely this woman who will be sure you get updates, videochats, etc. about your grandchild. I say this because if they're both free spirits, they likely won't last as a couple. And, if they do last as a couple, they will always remember that you made no effort to get to know her when you had the chance. YTA to yourself and them for not trying.", "NTA but honestly I\u2019d just fake it. They clearly aren\u2019t planning to be around much so unless you\u2019d rather cut him off entirely, why not just play along to keep things pleasant?", "NTA. And I don\u2019t *really* think your son is an asshole, but I think he\u2019s being a little clueless when it comes to your feelings and unrealistic with his expectations. You\u2019re hurt. You feel left out. You feel like you weren\u2019t important enough to be kept in the loop with these VERY big life events. He\u2019s not giving you any time to process that. I think you should try to talk to him about it. Not to blame him or like yell at him for it, but just to help him understand how you feel.", "NAH but I think you need to let go of your anger/upset that he doesn't stay in close contact with you. He's 25, not your little boy anymore. He's allowed to live his life as he wants. Be happy that he found someone who matches his free-spirit travel desires.", "How do you expect to form a bond with her if you won\u2019t make an effort?  \n\nYTA", "I agree with you. \n\nYou hear nothing for years then all of a sudden there he is with a partner and a baby demanding you love them. I get it. \n\nHowever, by not at least giving her a chance you\u2019re guaranteeing they will keep that distance. Is that your end goal? YWBTA if you let this pass you by.", "INFO: why are you referring to his fianc\u00e9e as his girlfriend? Is it because you don't recognise the engagement or you just wrote it by accident?\n\nETA: OP says she wrote girlfriend by accident and is neutral towards the new fianc\u00e9e. So I'm going to say NAH but please take seriously the advice shared by all the different verdicts. You should work on developing a positive relationship with this new family member.", "Soft YTA. I know it's difficult but you need to make an effort to get to know her and treat her with respect. If for no other reason but to be able to see your grandchild. You may not be able to be in physical proximity with your grandchild (a lot of us are in that situation) but you can see your grand baby over apps like Meet. But this will only happen if you make the effort with your son's girlfriend. \n\nI didn't know my sons' wives well when they each got married but I made the effort and now my Daughters In Law are two of my favorite people in the whole world. So make the effort. You owe it to your son, your soon to be grandchild and to yourself. And BTW, she sounds perfect for your son.", "It's a very reluctant YTA, it honestly sounds like you're actually mad at your son for not communicating with you properly and its leading to feelings of distaste for his girlfriend. I think you should sit your son down and explain the values of family and his responsibility to his parents which he does have considering it seems like you raised him with all the love and care that he needed. \n\nIts honestly a horrible thing for a child to see their parent not get along with a mother in law(I speak from experience). Try putting in more effort, if not for your son then for your grandkid. She might actually be the person who pulls your son closer to you and might help him keep more in contact.\n\nEdit: this is my speculations but you're more than welcome to correct me where necessary.", "At first, I wanted to go with N T A. But when you talk about her and compare her to your ex, and when you say you're not keen to invite her out but then say \"if I had more time to form a bond\", it kinda comes off like you're making zero effort to get to know her. So unless you can otherwise come out and say that you're making attempts to get to know her, I'm actually gunna lean Y T A. Your son is an adult and isn't required to be in contact with you all the time. His life is his life.", "YTA.  The title of your post calls your sons fianc\u00e9 who is carrying his child \u201chis new girlfriend\u201d. That alone shows the disrespect you feel towards her and your son.  You say you\u2019re not hostile, but don\u2019t want to invite her to do things with you.   FYI.  If he is doing volunteer work around the world, his lack of communications with you may be due more to lack of communication technology", "I\u2019m going to go slight YTA.  You say she can be an acquired taste and then go on to say that everyone but you likes her. So everyone quickly acquired it but you.  You say he is upset that you didn\u2019t \u201cinstantly connect\u201d with her.  Where those his words or yours?  He wants you to give her a chance.  Your problem is with your son not communicating with you.  This is not her fault.  It doesn\u2019t sound like you are willing to even try.  You will lose your son if you reject who he loves.", "In a way YTA. The reason being is you are taking your son's lack of communication with you out on his fianc\u00e9e, as if you hold her responsible. You may find her an acquired taste, but try and get to know her, find a common ground, as she is afterall carrying your first grandchild. \n\nI think there is the issue on your part of letting go of the apron strings, and the fianc\u00e9e and pregnancy reminds you that he is no longer your baby", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get that you aren't immediately taken with her, and that's not something you can force. However, it also doesn't sound like you're very interested in trying to meet her halfway.
