My husband and I agreed to let my daughter choose who she wants to invite - she chose to invite everyone in my family and my husband\u2019s family - except for my husband\u2019s mom and stepfather.\n\nA bit of backstory is that my MIL and FIL live out-of-state and have taken absolutely no interest in my daughter\u2019s life; they haven\u2019t even seen her in three years. During the past three years, my husband and I have tried to get them to FaceTime my daughter, but to no avail. My MIL recently (as in the last few weeks) started calling her once a week or so, but it took so many attempts to even get to that point. My MIL and FIL are both retired, so the lack of effort is certainly not due to a lack of time. They are also financially well-off and have taken MANY trips in the last few years, just not to see us. \n\nWell, my MIL and FIL invited themselves out here during  the days of my daughter\u2019s birthday and birthday party, so when they found out my daughter doesn\u2019t want them here, they were very offended. My MIL is complaining to the rest of my husband\u2019s family about how hurt she is. I\u2019m of the mindset that she has made no effort with my daughter, so why should my daughter have to include her in her birthday?

Your daughter is 5. I\u2019m skeptical you didn\u2019t lead her towards this decision in any way. Did she make a list of people she wanted to invite and didn\u2019t mention them? Did you ask and she said \u2018no\u2019?", "YTA for using a five year old as a scapegoat instead of communicating like an adult with your in-laws.", "INFO: Are you sure this isn't MIL and FIL's way of trying to reach out and build a connection? I know they haven't been around for several years, but it seems like in recent weeks MIL has started calling, and now they want to come for her birthday. \n\nAlso, she's five. If this really is her grandparents' way of trying to connect, wouldn't it be great to give her that opportunity?", "Does she explicitly not want them there....because I doubt she even realizes the relationship (unless you're leading her along). Some people just see/talk to their grandparents less.\n\n\nBut you're basically saying \"That's it, she's 5. You've lost your chance, can't form a relationship with her ever.\"", "YTA. Stop trying to pretend it's a 5 year olds decision.", "YTA.  Are you really blaming this on the whims of a five year old?  \n\nWhat if she randomly decided that she didn't want anyone from your side of the family there? \n\nWhy would you even tell them they weren't wanted by your 5 year old? Why create that tension when you claim that you want them to have a relationship?  You want them to be salty at a 5 year old?\n\nTo me it sounds retaliatory.  You were all too happy to let them know they were being rejected because you felt rejected.", "YTA. Your daughter is turning 5, she won\u2019t be upset if her grandparent is at her birthday party. Rather, you have issues with the grandparent and are trying to pass that down to your daughter. Don\u2019t use your daughter as ammunition for issues you have with other family members. Let her grow up and make her own decisions about who she cares about based on who made an effort to spend time with her in her life.", "INFO: Would your 5 year old be upset if MIL came to the party for some reason?\n\n5 year old: forgets to invite someone important.\nNormal response: oh what about grandma and grampa, did you know that there flying all the way here and want to see you on your birthday.", "YTA. Just admit you wanted to exclude them because you don't think they're doing enough for their granddaughter.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t let a FIVE year old pick and choose family to invite.  You\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t know them well, so NATURALLY she\u2019s not going to pick them to invite.", "INFO\n\nI'm curious why they haven't seen her in 3 years, but suddenly showed up for her 5th birthday party. What's the dynamic here? Have they not seen her for 3 years because most of those years were a pandemic and their health is at risk with small children or travel?\n\nDo they FaceTime anyone? Is your daughter actually singled out in not getting that contact, or are you asking them to adopt a new technology specifically for your child?\n\nHow often does your husband make any effort to stain in touch with them? It is a two way street and these are his parents.", "It sucks your mil hasn\u2019t been the grandparent she should be, but YTA for not letting her try now, the 5 year old says no, but she can\u2019t understand repercussions here, and one day when she\u2019s older she could blame you, also think it was unnecessary to tell mil this, that makes it seem vindictive Good luck", "Stop hiding behind your child. YTA. You are the one stirring up trouble, you wanted them involved, they are. Now you want to punish them. \n\nStay out of that child's head Joan Crawford!", "YTA. First of all, five year olds should not be in charge of party planning. Secondly, if there were a substantive reason your child didn't want them there--verbal abuse or some such--I'm pretty sure you would have mentioned it, so this is just about a lack of familiarity. But finally and most importantly: You're mad that your FIL and MIL haven't spent as much time with your kid, so you want to stop them from...spending more time with your kid? You want to see more effort on their part, so why are you throwing a fit when they're putting the effort in? This is all petty and small, and trying to pin it on the wishes of a kindergartener is pretty low.", "ESH, except your daughter. You\u2019re daughter is four, does she really not want them there or did she just not think of them since she doesn\u2019t know them. Yes it is her party but at that age if the party is mostly friends and family it is kind of rude to say they can\u2019t come that weekend if they are in town. But also if they are expecting that weekend to be about them bonding with your child they won\u2019t be happy. You and your family are going to be focused on making the five year old happy and not forcing them to spend time together. Your five year old is going to focus on playing with people she knows not bonding with people she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nSmart kid you are raising there.\n\nAlso, never too young to learn how to put up boundaries. Her party, her choice of guests. Nice to see someone parenting with respect for their kid's feelings.", "NTA. My (ex) MIL is similar to this. When I brought my son to my home state to visit in the past, both times she completely ignored my son acting like it was his job to approach her. He was 3 and 4 years old at the time of these visits. The adults in a child\u2019s life have to make an effort to get to know them. It\u2019s a fuck around and find out kind of situation. I\u2019ve already informed my ex husband that when I go home again this year, I won\u2019t be making plans to see his mother. He completely understands. If your in laws don\u2019t want to make an effort, why the hell should your 5 year old daughter?", "NTA and I like your approach to letting your daughter choose the guests for her birthday. Your MiL had 5 years to try and form a bond with your daughter, and are surprised that this child has no idea who they are and don\u2019t think of them as family. Kids remember these things growing up", "NTA.  Your daughter has the right to invite who she wants to her party. She is old enough to understand that those grandparents don't prioritize her. In response she doesn't want them around. Simple as that.", "NTA but...is it possible to have a conversation with the 5yo about these gparents being in the area at the time of her party and asking if she's willing to offer them an invitation as a way to boost the relationship? (In age-appropriate terms, obviously.) It's ok to set boundaries but it's also ok to teach and model forgiveness and grace. If they're making an effort, maybe she lets them know that she appreciates it.\n\nI say this coming from a very similar situation. My kids have next to nothing to do with my parents as young adults after years of them doing next to nothing to foster the relationship. I encourage them to be open to people changing. Expect nothing but leave the door open.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter doesn't want them at her b-day, then that ought to be respected. \n\nYour MIL and FIL should take this experience as a sign to focus on trying to be present for their granddaughter.", "nta the kid was asked to invite people she knows and she doesnt know them as was said they do have the money to come visit but they chose not to they cant expect a kid that barely knows them to drop everything and cater to their needs because they have decided to become grandparents they probably wont even see the kid for another few years", "NTA. Your MIL should stop being offended and see this as a wake up call - relationships require work. If they haven\u2019t seen her since she was 2, no wonder she didn\u2019t think to invite them or want them there - they are strangers to her. That and it is rude to simply invite yourself out to visit someone without their say so.", "Unlike everyone else. NTA. They haven't made any effort, and I believe that 5 is old enough to realise if someone doesn't pay any attention to you. All young children notice if someone ignores them. If she truly said she doesn't want them there, then that's fine. That's her choice, and as long as you didn't coach her, nta.\n\nEven if not seeing her in person was due to the pandemic, wouldn't you do anything possible to see your grandchild, like, for example, face timing, which she has only started to do recently.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s a long way away from \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want them there\u201d. Something seems to be missing here.", "You definitely sound like the AH. INFO - how does a five year old exclude grandparents?", "NTA \nYour MIL and FIL were not in your daughter's life during the period when she's developing the understanding of who her family is. From what you've explained, that was completely their decision. This is a consequence of that decision. They need to put in the work to build a relationship with your daughter who they've chosen not to see in 3(!!!) years. \n\nYour daughter has communicated she doesn't want them at the party. You can allow them to be there, but I wouldn't be surprised if it results in a very unhappy five year old. \n\nI went through this. I had an amazing set of grandparents and another set that wanted nothing to do with us, except when they did (even my parents buying them plane tickets didn't get them to visit). By five, I absolutely wanted nothing to do with them and my sibling and I would both cry when we had to see them. Yes, your five year old knows. If they want to be in her life, they need to fix things with her and just showing up when she doesn't want them isn't likely going to help, but she could just ignore them like we did. Or she could cry and make it clear they are unwanted.", "So what you\u2019re saying is that they haven\u2019t seen her in 3 years\u2026. She will be 5 now and so she last saw them at 2 yrs old and your toddler has been so offended ever since then and has decided to not invite them for said reasons \ud83d\ude44\n\nPlease stop using your child as an excuse for your own pettiness. YTA!", "YTA - you\u2019re saying how you are unhappy with their lack of effort, this is them making at least some effort for what you say is the first time in several years. I would have thought you\u2019d be in the mindset to pursue that relationship and encourage their involvement. Shutting them out now while they are already in town is incredibly petty. Your daughter is 5 and won\u2019t have a full understanding of relationships yet so blaming it on her choice is an excuse (unless she has explicitly stated without encouragement she really does not want to see them). They should be welcome to join the event, your daughter might bond with them and the relationship blossom. It\u2019s your responsibility to encourage those relationships until your daughter is old enough to understand and make her own choices", "Yes, I'd also like to know what the daughter says is her reasoning for not inviting them. If a kid says they don't want to be around someone, that should be respected. Does she have other reasons for being uncomfortable besides never seeing this person before?", "Seriously. Choose which friends, yes. Choose which family, no. \n\nThe important thing is they\u2019re making an effort now, be the bigger person and take it.", "And the past 3 years they\u2019ve been MIA have been during a Pandemic.

I could easily see family that travel a lot (even out of the country) avoid seeing an infant/toddler during a pandemic because of their travels.", "Are we really all coddling a grown ass adult who can\u2019t be bothered to develop a relationship with a grandchild and then wants a fucking pity party cause they\u2019re not special enough to be thought of by said grandchild?

And in 12 years when mil has  no relationship with the 5 year old like she does the other grandkids she can blame herself. If the child was older then I say let it be her choice but at 5 they can\u2019t think rationally.", "Well they may just now feel safe traveling since they are in the risk factor age of Covid.", "Same, great kid knows who matters to her most.", "> Your MiL had 5 years to try and form a bond with your daughter\n\nSo what, is the door closed to that now? No chance for MIL to start trying now? Kids barely remember anything from before they were 5 years old, its not like things can't change.", "At 5?  LOL.  I'm very very involved with my nephew and I promise you I was an afterthought for his 5th birthday.  He was focused on inviting his friends.", "> She is old enough to understand that those grandparents don't prioritize her.\n\nYou really think a 4 year old understand relationships to that extent? All they know is that they don't see grandma and grandpa very often, they don't know why.", "Does a kid at their 5th birthday cater to anyone?  LOL"]}
