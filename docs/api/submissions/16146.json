They are also financially well-off and have taken MANY trips in the last few years, just not to see us. \n\nWell, my MIL and FIL invited themselves out here during  the days of my daughter\u2019s birthday and birthday party, so when they found out my daughter doesn\u2019t want them here, they were very offended.

Your daughter is 5. I\u2019m skeptical you didn\u2019t lead her towards this decision in any way. Did she make a list of people she wanted to invite and didn\u2019t mention them? Did you ask and she said \u2018no\u2019?", "YTA for using a five year old as a scapegoat instead of communicating like an adult with your in-laws.", "INFO: Are you sure this isn't MIL and FIL's way of trying to reach out and build a connection? I know they haven't been around for several years, but it seems like in recent weeks MIL has started calling, and now they want to come for her birthday. \n\nAlso, she's five. If this really is her grandparents' way of trying to connect, wouldn't it be great to give her that opportunity?", "Does she explicitly not want them there....because I doubt she even realizes the relationship (unless you're leading her along). Some people just see/talk to their grandparents less.\n\n\nBut you're basically saying \"That's it, she's 5. You've lost your chance, can't form a relationship with her ever.\"", "YTA. Stop trying to pretend it's a 5 year olds decision.", "YTA.  Are you really blaming this on the whims of a five year old?  \n\nWhat if she randomly decided that she didn't want anyone from your side of the family there? \n\nWhy would you even tell them they weren't wanted by your 5 year old? Why create that tension when you claim that you want them to have a relationship?  You want them to be salty at a 5 year old?\n\nTo me it sounds retaliatory.  You were all too happy to let them know they were being rejected because you felt rejected.", "YTA. Your daughter is turning 5, she won\u2019t be upset if her grandparent is at her birthday party. Rather, you have issues with the grandparent and are trying to pass that down to your daughter. Don\u2019t use your daughter as ammunition for issues you have with other family members.

Just admit you wanted to exclude them because you don't think they're doing enough for their granddaughter.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t let a FIVE year old pick and choose family to invite.

Is your daughter actually singled out in not getting that contact, or are you asking them to adopt a new technology specifically for your child?\n\nHow often does your husband make any effort to stain in touch with them? It is a two way street and these are his parents.", "It sucks your mil hasn\u2019t been the grandparent she should be, but YTA for not letting her try now, the 5 year old says no, but she can\u2019t understand repercussions here, and one day when she\u2019s older she could blame you, also think it was unnecessary to tell mil this, that makes it seem vindictive Good luck", "Stop hiding behind your child.

First of all, five year olds should not be in charge of party planning. Secondly, if there were a substantive reason your child didn't want them there--verbal abuse or some such--I'm pretty sure you would have mentioned it, so this is just about a lack of familiarity. But finally and most importantly: You're mad that your FIL and MIL haven't spent as much time with your kid, so you want to stop them from...spending more time with your kid? You want to see more effort on their part, so why are you throwing a fit when they're putting the effort in? This is all petty and small, and trying to pin it on the wishes of a kindergartener is pretty low.", "ESH, except your daughter. You\u2019re daughter is four, does she really not want them there or did she just not think of them since she doesn\u2019t know them. Yes it is her party but at that age if the party is mostly friends and family it is kind of rude to say they can\u2019t come that weekend if they are in town. But also if they are expecting that weekend to be about them bonding with your child they won\u2019t be happy. You and your family are going to be focused on making the five year old happy and not forcing them to spend time together. Your five year old is going to focus on playing with people she knows not bonding with people she doesn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nSmart kid you are raising there.\n\nAlso, never too young to learn how to put up boundaries. Her party, her choice of guests. Nice to see someone parenting with respect for their kid's feelings.", "NTA. My (ex) MIL is similar to this. When I brought my son to my home state to visit in the past, both times she completely ignored my son acting like it was his job to approach her. He was 3 and 4 years old at the time of these visits. The adults in a child\u2019s life have to make an effort to get to know them. It\u2019s a fuck around and find out kind of situation. I\u2019ve already informed my ex husband that when I go home again this year, I won\u2019t be making plans to see his mother. He completely understands.

Your MiL had 5 years to try and form a bond with your daughter, and are surprised that this child has no idea who they are and don\u2019t think of them as family. Kids remember these things growing up", "NTA.  Your daughter has the right to invite who she wants to her party. She is old enough to understand that those grandparents don't prioritize her. In response she doesn't want them around. Simple as that.", "NTA but...is it possible to have a conversation with the 5yo about these gparents being in the area at the time of her party and asking if she's willing to offer them an invitation as a way to boost the relationship? (In age-appropriate terms, obviously.) It's ok to set boundaries but it's also ok to teach and model forgiveness and grace. If they're making an effort, maybe she lets them know that she appreciates it.\n\nI say this coming from a very similar situation. My kids have next to nothing to do with my parents as young adults after years of them doing next to nothing to foster the relationship. I encourage them to be open to people changing. Expect nothing but leave the door open.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter doesn't want them at her b-day, then that ought to be respected. \n\nYour MIL and FIL should take this experience as a sign to focus on trying to be present for their granddaughter.", "nta the kid was asked to invite people she knows and she doesnt know them as was said they do have the money to come visit but they chose not to they cant expect a kid that barely knows them to drop everything and cater to their needs because they have decided to become grandparents they probably wont even see the kid for another few years", "NTA. Your MIL should stop being offended and see this as a wake up call - relationships require work. If they haven\u2019t seen her since she was 2, no wonder she didn\u2019t think to invite them or want them there - they are strangers to her. That and it is rude to simply invite yourself out to visit someone without their say so.", "Unlike everyone else. NTA. They haven't made any effort, and I believe that 5 is old enough to realise if someone doesn't pay any attention to you. All young children notice if someone ignores them. If she truly said she doesn't want them there, then that's fine. That's her choice, and as long as you didn't coach her, nta.\n\nEven if not seeing her in person was due to the pandemic, wouldn't you do anything possible to see your grandchild, like, for example, face timing, which she has only started to do recently.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can allow them to be there, but I wouldn't be surprised if it results in a very unhappy five year old. \n\nI went through this. I had an amazing set of grandparents and another set that wanted nothing to do with us, except when they did (even my parents buying them plane tickets didn't get them to visit). By five, I absolutely wanted nothing to do with them and my sibling and I would both cry when we had to see them. Yes, your five year old knows.

Your daughter is 5 and won\u2019t have a full understanding of relationships yet so blaming it on her choice is an excuse (unless she has explicitly stated without encouragement she really does not want to see them).

For your daughter to start to understand who they are when they call by actually meeting them in person. I invited my grandmother who I've only seen less than 5 times in the last 30 years to my daughter's party and she flew across the country to meet her and my other kids. My son was 4 and still talks about her and now they talk on the phone about once a month. Before there he had no idea who she was. \n\nThis is not the way to go about getting a bond built.
