Your friend already did you a favour with the job, it's reasonable not to insist since he already has a real estate agent looking at exactly what he wants.\n\nYour wife sounded unprofessional too. If her boss told her to not bother with the suburb, there is no reason for her to want to work with a person explicitly interested in the said suburb.", "NTA Your wife is bringing MLM energy to her new career - leveraging any acquaintance you have to support yourself. It's tacky and manipulative.", "NTA\nShe was being manipulative, also a complete amateur. Would not be a wise decision", "NTA. I bought a house 18 months ago and it's incredibly stressful and challenging. We had an extremely unprofessional realtor who almost lost us the house. Either your friend really does have a realtor he trusts or he doesn't want to risk a new one. Both are perfectly fair.", "NTA you supported her by asking in the first place. he declined and pushing further isn\u2019t appropriate and definitely not a good move if you want your friendship to remain intact. Your wife sounds very selfish and petty.", "NTA\nNot mixing friends with business is a good way to go.\nYour wife is out of line for nagging at you.", "NTA. You asked, he answered. She needs to respect his response. Supporting her career doesn\u2019t mean harassing people into using her.", "NTA and as someone who is dealing with a real estate agent now, if I'm selling such a house, I wouldn't want anyone with 3 days experience even stepping foot INSIDE it for pictures.\n\nShe needs to work her way up. It's not about supporting her, this is experience we're talking about here. She has effectively NONE and her boss sounds like an ass and working for a high pressured firm. Not a good thing.", "NTA\n\n'no' is a complete sentence. Your friend gave his answer. Your wife should respect that. End of story.", "NTA. You asked, and your friend said no. He already has a realtor. I\u2019m not sure what your wife wants you to do. Does she think calling him a liar and insisting she become his realtor is going to be productive? Pursuing that course of action will only result in losing your friend.", "NTA. What if your friend buys a house offered by your wife and it turns out there are some hidden defects? You might lose your friendship that way.", "NTA. Your wife is a trip.", "NTA You are supportive cuz you did asked and he said no. Is she expecting you to force your friend to say yes? \n\nAhe needs to understand that every begging is hard and that she needs to make her own way up. She isn't entitled to get great selling on a silver plater. She  needs to work hard, be a little patient and branch out in the city.", "NTA, there's a reason MLM's defend themselves so often with \" What we do is legal! look: real estate I quite similar\"\n\nBut it doesn't have to be similar at all, of the real estate firm has some ethics...", "NTA. You tried and your friend turned you down. Your wife is being pushy and immature. He already helped you out plenty.", "No.. she's not right at all, in fact she's TA. NTA Op. Mixing real estate business with friendships don't go well at all anyways. Tell your wife she needs to find her own contacts and not to expect the 1st house she sells to be a million dollar home. You can be supportive of her career and still say no.", "Wow, your friend said no because he basically already has a realtor and your wife took it very personal. The remark that she made was rude and tells me she feels insulted on a personal level. \n\nI can understand she wants to have the experience and success (and commission) of your friend's home but no means no.  Your wife needs to understand that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. What\u2019s her co name so I can avoid using their service? She\u2019s extremely unprofessional and tacky. Don\u2019t bring her at hangout events with the friend imo", "Your wife sounds manipulative and dillusional . If she thinks she has the right qualification to sell  a 1.1 million house. Even if they want to buy a house that expensive, I wouldn't want a real estate agent that's literally just start the job, then she's off her rocker.\n\nYou asked your friend and they said no.  As is their right.\n\nJust because you know the person doesn't give your wife the right to ask you to hound your friend.\n\nI think your wife doesn't care about your relationship, she just wants the commission.\n\nYour friend is right to stick with someone he knows and its his choice who to pick.\n\nYou have to a certain amount of trust with someone who is going to be asked to help with something so expensive.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's a terrible idea. Having a friend as a realtor can ruin relationships (friendship ended within 3 months of the purchase of my money pit home). \n\nYour wife can build a client base without ruining your social lives. Maybe she can recommend your friend to someone more experienced in her firm and build relationships that way.", "NTA I lost a long time family friend (who was a real estate agent) over the sale of my late mothers home. There were issues between the heirs which were causing problems, which affected the house sale. The friend knew about these issues, I tried to discourage her, she insisted, the whole thing blew up, the executor chose a different realtor because of all the issues, somehow I was the asshole even though I warned her this would happen and tried to discourage her.  Sadly, my friend, you are in a no win situation. I wish you luck.", "NTA\n\nI also just became a realtor, and the number one thing you\u2019re not supposed to do is convince anyone of anything- not just bc it\u2019s immoral but bc there\u2019s huge liability there. \n\nShe needs to seriously adjust her attitude and focus on hosting open houses if she wants to meet new clients.\n\nShe also can\u2019t expect to move to a new area and think people won\u2019t have their own established connections. If anything she should be nice and try to meet your friends realtor and learn from them to see if they can make the same connections for her future clients.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not a competition, you have to work with realtors in the area- not try to poach clients through coercion.", "NTA would you want someone with 3 days experience and this rude and volatile ? \n\nTBH you should not have even asked your friend the first time - thats just embarrassing and he was super kind not to go wtf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's not going to do well if she can't handle being told no.", "NTA.\n\nSupport is things like words of encouragement or offering to take care of dinner so she can host an open house.  It doesn't mean forcing your family to shill for your business and strong arm your friends into being clients.  Being a successful full-time realtor requires a lot of drive and hussle and putting yourself out there, but strong-arming friends and family isn't the way to get there.
