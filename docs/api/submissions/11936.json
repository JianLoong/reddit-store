If she hadn't been an AH about it, you could have offered to lend her some of the bigger things that would be easy to get back when you need them again, but she sounds like she's selfish enough to keep them when you want them back because she's going to have another kid herself.\n\nSource: I have a one-year-old.

She's acting entitled to things that arent hers.", "NTA", "Let's look at this from a different angle.\n\nDid she know *before* she saw the loft full of baby stuff that you had a child a year older than her child? Of course she did.\n\nDid she know you had not given her all your old baby stuff? Of course she did.\n\nCould she, at any point, have said \"Hey, if (your baby) outgrows anything, could you send it my way\"? Of course she could.\n\nShe wasn't concerned about outgrown clothes. So she's not concerned about outgrown clothes.\n\n> we kept all of the clothes, bassinet, car seat, push chair etc. stuff\n\nThe only difference is that she saw a room full of more expensive/big ticket items.\n\nSometimes people see things like that and get greedy.\n\nSome people feel like, if you're not immediately using something, they should have a right to it.\n\nIt could be something like that. It could also be that she's had her eye on a particular piece of baby furniture she hasn't been able to buy, and you have that item.\n\nBut she acted perfectly normally that evening, so while I can't know and don't like to assume... I'm guessing it's more likely she mentioned something to her husband, who then had a problem with it.\n\nAnd...\n\nSo what?\n\nThey make more than you do. If you're better off than they are with half the income, it's because they *chose* to manage their money poorly.\n\nAnd even if *they* made half as much, you're not obligated to provide for *their* child. Yet rather than asking politely if you could help out, she insulted you for... not assuming she was too poor to provide for her child? Sounds ridiculous when I say it that way, doesn't it? \n\nIt doesn't matter if you're saving the baby stuff for another baby. Or selling it to buy toddler stuff. Or giving it to family. Or saving it to build a shrine to your son when he grows up/moves out. Or donating it to Goodwill. \n\nIt's *your property*. She has no claim on it.\n\nFurthermore, *because* she addressed this from a point of entitlement, if you *do* give her anything, she will then feel like you owe her *everything* your child outgrows. And since people never de-escalate entitled behavior on their own and tend to escalate when that behavior is enabled... it's going to get worse.\n\n\"Don't you think little Timmy is too *old* for that toy? You should get him something more *appropriate*. DW my little Bobby is *just the right age*, he'll take care of it.\"\n\nYou absolutely should not give this woman anything *because* of how she approached the situation. \n\nAnd she *did* insult you, so she owes you an apology.

Silence speaks volumes. Your friend is rude.", "op=NTA\n\nAnyone who comes into your home and then demands that you should give them stuff for free--are A-Hs.\n\nDoesn't matter what her finances are, she doesn't get to determine what you do with YOUR stuff.  I think maybe it's time for you to let there be some distance between you and Sarah.", "In the friend's defense, I can understand that she's going through a rough time and it feels like everyone else's circumstances are much more fortunate than hers.  \n\nAt the same time, her text to OP *was* rude and petty.  She is literally scolding OP for what she has in her house!  I agree with other comments that this warrants a response from OP.  There are a lot of great suggestions here!", "I had a situation where my friend was obligating everyone in her family and circle of friends to contribute to her entire wedding fund.  One day she called me at work and asked me if I would put up half of their deposit for the venue she chose or she was going to lose her date. \n\nThe way that I handled it was that I listened to her dilemma.  She told me that she had already called anyone she could think of to help.  I responded to the effect that I appreciated the phone call, but I'm not the right person to ask.  She demanded why, and I told her that I have my own policy that I don't lend money to friends and intend for it to stay that way.\n\nInstead of her taking no for an answer, she pressed me about reaching into my savings and promised to pay me back.  This was just plain disrespectful, but I held firm and told her that I value our friendship too much to mix finances into it, wished her good luck, then ended the call.", "Right? The entitlement is off the charts!", "Nicely done never let anyone pressure you to give up money. I've had people that aren't even friends try this with me. (I don't consider work colleagues friends especially if we aren't close).\n\nIf people think you're financially okay they get so entitled to your money it's absolutely crazy.", "My uncle was a realtor and told me it was common for him to see people living in big expensive houses with barely any furniture, because they\u2019d maxed out their budget on the house and then had nothing left.", "My friend's former in-laws were all of that.  Had brand new SUVs every year.  Once, when his car was out of commission I drove him and his kids to the in-laws home for custody transfer (ex-wife was living there, too).  I was kind of impressed I guess when I saw a huge house on a fairly good sized lot in what I knew was a very expensive zip code.\n\nI tried not to show my shock as I helped the kids unload: most of the rooms were completely empty of furniture, the family room with their toys used milk crate style boxes for storage.  The kids' mattresses were on the floor -- no box springs or bed frames.  Or desks.  Or dressers.  Only a single card table for each of them.\n\nTheir marriage broke up largely because ex-wife and her family looked down on my friend's more modest lifestyle and refusal to get a new car every year.", "Right. You text and thank them for the outfit they lent. \n\nYou ask how you should return the outfit. If they say keep it... you thank them and maybe let them know you would be grateful for anything else they decide to get rid of in the future that the kid outgrows. That's it."]}
