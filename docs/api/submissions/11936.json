If you had asked for support, I\u2019m sure we would have done what we could, but please don\u2019t expect me to read your mind.

You're under no obligation to help. \n\nAre you a charity or something refusing to help someone in need ?

Also just demanding that give her stuff ... big no. Kinda weird that she never told you about her struggels but now that she is seeing potential things being free she is telling (in a demanding way) you about it. If she really had financial issues she could have asked you way earlier if you'd be willing to lend her stuff, obviously she knew you had baby stuff", "NTA. Sarah is odd.

She called me unfeeling and a snob too.\n\nI get she is struggling and the frustration is getting to your friend.   She is not entitled to anything you have OP. \n\n Her calling you names and such tell you how much of a 'friend' she is.\n\n\n>My husband and I intend to try to have more than 1 child so we kept all of the clothes, bassinet, car seat, push chair etc.\n\n This is Very smart move.    And really if you wanted to get rid of this stuff that's up to you as well.  I'd sell it to make a little back myself", "NTA. Your reason for keeping all your baby stuff is very reasonable and normal, and even if you were planning to give it away, how would you know to offer it to Sarah if she never asked or indicated she was in need? Their financial situation isn't even relevant - even if they can't afford to buy baby stuff, that doesn't obligate you to give them things you still plan to use. If she hadn't been an AH about it, you could have offered to lend her some of the bigger things that would be easy to get back when you need them again, but she sounds like she's selfish enough to keep them when you want them back because she's going to have another kid herself.\n\nSource: I have a one-year-old. We have lots of hand-me-down baby stuff that all came from friends who are done having kids, and we are keeping everything we think we might use again with a second kid, even though we have friends who are pregnant now. It never occurred to us to expect used baby stuff from people who will need it again, and no one has asked us for any of ours because they know we hope we're not done with it. You are doing this the normal way, really.", "NTA sounds like a shit friend.", "NTA, if they are so much in debt then why did they have a baby - like the most expensive thing ever? (At least in my country the calculation is that your first kid will cost you nearly a million, the next ones less - including everything you have to provide till they are adults.)", "Nta. That stuff is in storage for your next baby. Not for her. As harsh as it sounds I had to wait years to have a baby to ensure we could afford it.

She just wanted something for free so that she didn't have to spend money on it. \n\nShe's not a friend and probably hasn't been for a while. \n\nYou need to send her a quick and short text. \"Well, guess this ends our friendship\".", "NTA if she and her partner are incompetent parents, it\u2019s not up for you to pick up their slack and provide for their child contrary to how entitled she\u2019s acting.\n\nWhen people choose to have children, you\u2019d think they\u2019d consider how expensive they are. Unfortunately many don\u2019t. Choices.", "NTA i also kept all of my baby things after my first was born as we wanted more children. we have 3 now and saved an absolute fortune this way. your friend owes you an apology. even if you didn't want any more children, she is not entitled to the stuff your son has outgrown. she is being very entitled.", "NTA - Why do people seem to feel entitled to other people stuff?", "NTA\nSarah has jealousy issues. If they are in a bad financial situation you aren't responsible for that. Keep the clothes, you may need them. Sarah isn't your friend.", "NTA, not your responsibility to help out a mother in need. She gave birth she needs to be responsible for her own child by getting him what he needs. Don\u2019t feel bad for helping someone who thinks they are titled to your things.", "NTA. We also wanted 2 and kept all the things from baby 1 which worked out great when we had our second. I also bought tons of stuff from yard sales. She's acting entitled to things that arent hers.", "NTA", "Let's look at this from a different angle.\n\nDid she know *before* she saw the loft full of baby stuff that you had a child a year older than her child? Of course she did.\n\nDid she know you had not given her all your old baby stuff? Of course she did.\n\nCould she, at any point, have said \"Hey, if (your baby) outgrows anything, could you send it my way\"? Of course she could.\n\nShe wasn't concerned about outgrown clothes. So she's not concerned about outgrown clothes.\n\n> we kept all of the clothes, bassinet, car seat, push chair etc. stuff\n\nThe only difference is that she saw a room full of more expensive/big ticket items.\n\nSometimes people see things like that and get greedy.\n\nSome people feel like, if you're not immediately using something, they should have a right to it.\n\nIt could be something like that. It could also be that she's had her eye on a particular piece of baby furniture she hasn't been able to buy, and you have that item.\n\nBut she acted perfectly normally that evening, so while I can't know and don't like to assume... I'm guessing it's more likely she mentioned something to her husband, who then had a problem with it.\n\nAnd...\n\nSo what?\n\nThey make more than you do. If you're better off than they are with half the income, it's because they *chose* to manage their money poorly.\n\nAnd even if *they* made half as much, you're not obligated to provide for *their* child. Yet rather than asking politely if you could help out, she insulted you for... not assuming she was too poor to provide for her child? Sounds ridiculous when I say it that way, doesn't it? \n\nIt doesn't matter if you're saving the baby stuff for another baby. Or selling it to buy toddler stuff. Or giving it to family. Or saving it to build a shrine to your son when he grows up/moves out. Or donating it to Goodwill. \n\nIt's *your property*. She has no claim on it.\n\nFurthermore, *because* she addressed this from a point of entitlement, if you *do* give her anything, she will then feel like you owe her *everything* your child outgrows. And since people never de-escalate entitled behavior on their own and tend to escalate when that behavior is enabled... it's going to get worse.\n\n\"Don't you think little Timmy is too *old* for that toy? You should get him something more *appropriate*. DW my little Bobby is *just the right age*, he'll take care of it.\"\n\nYou absolutely should not give this woman anything *because* of how she approached the situation. \n\nAnd she *did* insult you, so she owes you an apology. Whether you insist on that or not is obviously up to you, but you are definitely NTA\n\n(PS: please don't build a shrine to your adult child(ren), lol)", "NTA.
