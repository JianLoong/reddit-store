I have a 2yo son and she has a not quite 1yo son.\n\nMy husband and I intend to try to have more than 1 child so we kept all of the clothes, bassinet, car seat, push chair etc. stuff that our son has grown out of.\n\nMy friend, call her Sarah, came for dinner with her family on Wednesday. Her son made a mess of his clothes and I guess they didn\u2019t have any spares in his baby bag. So I offered for Sarah to borrow some of my son\u2019s stuff.\n\nI took her to the loft and I have boxes and vacuum sealed bags of my son\u2019s stuff that he\u2019s outgrown. She asked a couple of questions about what I have but nothing out of the ordinary. I let her pick an outfit from the 9-12 month box and left it at that. At the time she just said thank you and the evening carried on normally.\n\nThis morning she sent me a long text about how given the fact that my husband and I are better off than her, and her family is struggling with debts, I should have helped her out by giving her the stuff my son doesn\u2019t use anymore. She called me unfeeling and a snob too.\n\nI\u2019m really shocked by all of this. I\u2019m a SAHM, while Sarah and her husband each earn what my husband does. While I\u2019m sure that they could maybe have debts I don\u2019t understand her vitriol towards me.

I had no idea you were struggling with debts. Still I am surprised by your message. We are planning on having more kids and thus, I intend to keep these things so that I don't have to buy new clothes again. \"", "NTA, I\u2019d rethink this friendship if I didn\u2019t get an apology.", "NTA, she sounds incredibly rude.", "NTA she's not your true friend she's taking an advantage of you and making you feel bad please for your sake just cut her off.", "NTA. U are keeping the clothes and other things for your second baby and whilst she is struggling you have done nothing wrong and have a reason for keeping it all.", "NTA. You've done nothing wrong.", "Nta but she is", "NTA. Sorry that it happened to you.", "No, you are not a A Hole, but his situation was an eye opener.", "NTA.  The hide of some people!", "NTA-Given that you had just helped her out, her message is incredibly rude and hurtful. \n\nMy response to something like this would be the following: \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you feel this way especially right after I willingly helped ~son~ out. If you had asked for support, I\u2019m sure we would have done what we could, but please don\u2019t expect me to read your mind. I can\u2019t know that you need help until you request it.\u201d \n\nDo NOT bring up your plans for future children, any salary comparison, or her debts in your response. You never respond to an entitled person/taker personality with reasons, because you give them control to argue down. If she asks for hand-me-downs, give only what you are willing to permanently part with, and make it clear that she is \u201cborrowing\u201d. In case you don\u2019t get the items back, you won\u2019t be disappointed. You are also perfectly within your right to say no to anything she requests. Again, a generic response. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but we just can\u2019t do X.\u201d Never, ever give a reason!", "NTA but I do empathize with her and while I could be wrong it might just be stress boiling over. I'd suggest having a talk with her and share your feelings. If she doesn't apologize or anything then yeah I'd suggest rethinking being friends with her.", "Why would you be the asshole? You're under no obligation to help. \n\nAre you a charity or something refusing to help someone in need ? If no then I don't see why you're obligated to do anything.\n\nBeing poor/debt doesn't entitle anyone to demand things from people they assume are well off. Maybe you have debts too how is she to know this? \n\nNTA but you should probably reconsider this friendship", "NTA. She\u2019s rude and entitled. They make double what your fam does and it isn\u2019t on you if they lived outside their means and racked up debts you don\u2019t have. Also - if she never TOLD you they were struggling financially you wouldn\u2019t have known to offer help in the first place. Another also - it is very common for parents to keep baby clothing for scrap books, quilts, or as in your case planned future children - especially single income households that can\u2019t spend tons of money rebuying baby clothing again.", "NTA you plan to have another child,  you dont give away your baby stuff when you plan to reuse it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also just demanding that give her stuff ... big no. Kinda weird that she never told you about her struggels but now that she is seeing potential things being free she is telling (in a demanding way) you about it. If she really had financial issues she could have asked you way earlier if you'd be willing to lend her stuff, obviously she knew you had baby stuff", "NTA. Sarah is odd. And it's not odd for you to be holding on to your baby stuff for a future child.", "Agree with this. It acknowledges her message and hopefully shuts down further entitlement. NTA"]}
