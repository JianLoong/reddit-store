The last time L invited H, I invited two other kids in their class, J and K. J is a boy who can play rough but H and K really enjoy him.  L\u2019s mom was fine with K but was very upset that J came, claiming that J is mean to L.  I went out to dinner with J and K\u2019s moms, we didn\u2019t invite L\u2019s mom but she has other friends there.  We get a call about 45 minutes later to come back. We show up to H and J heavy sobbing. We are told that H and J had dragged L, hit and kicked her, and said hurtful things.  It was another worker who told us. H and J swear they were just playing, L didn\u2019t understand, and her mom told them that they were being bully\u2019s. The worker said they witnessed it happen and it had appeared to start as playing rough but they would not stop when L asked. L\u2019s mom did not speak or text me later about it.  She wouldn\u2019t even look at us when we came in. I have never had anyone tell me H is mean nor have I seen it so I do believe it was rough play that was misunderstood.\n\nA month ago they had the night I thought it best not to go with L. I invited the other girls in the class, 4 other kids.  We told the girls they could not discuss it at school, we didn\u2019t want L to be hurt.  L\u2019s mom didn\u2019t text any of us to invite so I assumed they wouldn\u2019t go and it would be fine.  The event starts and we\u2019re sitting in a big circle, our husbands came too so 10 adults. L shows up.  L came with a group of other friends not from school.  L and her friends played away from our girls, when our girls went over to play with L too she told them she was having fun with other friends and would rather play separate.  Our girls feelings were hurt. Her mom hung out with other parents and did not speak to us.\n\nFast forward. L\u2019s moms business took off and is having a celebration party in the next few weeks that I found out will include a few pro athletes, one of which H is a huge fan of.  I didn\u2019t know she was friends with pro athletes but found out she is actually dating one.  L invited one girl from the class she has become close too and her parents are also welcome. I text L\u2019s mom and ask if H could go.  Her mom texts me back \u201cNo.\u201d I ask her if we could go out for dinner to try to fix it.  No response.  Last night we did a gathering at our home with all of the class. I invited L, her mom, and moms boyfriend. Her mom again did not text back and they didn\u2019t come. \n\nA mom friend told me that I was being a mean girl and it now appears I\u2019m trying to use her. I don\u2019t see it that way and I feel she\u2019s purposely leaving H out knowing how big of a fan she is.\n\nAm I being the asshole?\n\nEdit to add: I did not know before that J bullied L and did not think bringing kids from their class would be an issue. H did apologize to L for the incident. By rough play I mean J is into football and likes to tackle or wrestle, H and K also play that way.\n\nI chose not to invite L because I felt the girls needed space and she seemed to be the only one who had problems with others.", "created_utc": 1679780930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1220dxm/aita_for_purposely_not_including_the_new_girl_at/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your kid is mean and being taught by you it okay to exclude people. (Unless it benefits you to not.) \n\n2. You sound truly awful to be around. You talk as though your better than L\u2019s mom, why?

It is not a misunderstanding when one child violates the consent of another when it comes to touching bodies (L was telling H to stop, and H did not). This was a big event and should have been handled with much more care (the dinner to fix things would have been appropriate then, not now that you are interested in H getting to meet a hero athlete). Kids make these kinds of mistakes, and as a parent, it's your job to teach them exactly what the mistake was and how not to do it again. You should not have brushed this under the rug as a \"misunderstanding\".\n\nL's mom is simply trying to protect her daughter by keeping H away from her, and L's mom is in the right for doing that. I don't see any way you can fix this now, and it would be best to leave L and her mom alone forever.", "YTA. You refused to believe your child was being a bully when told by the person who witnessed it. You didn't apologize or have your child apologize because you simply didn't believe it.

YTA.", "YTA\n\nSeven years old is old enough to know when someone says stop, you stop. That incident at the very least should have included a sit down where the kids responsible and their parents should have apologized. They need to know how to properly apologize and atone. These are crucial life lessons and you dropped the ball.\n\nNo means no and \"we do not touch other people without their permission\" have been constantly reinforced with my kids since they were toddlers. Stop dismissing rough play as just a thing some kids do. If they're not all playing the same game, it's hurtful. If they're all consenting to rough play, fine. If not, it stops right away. \n\nNot only did you drop the ball with parenting your kid, you taught her to ostracize the kid that didn't just go along with something that hurt them. You showed her mom that you were okay with the behavior and you didn't care. THEN you tried to use her to get something special for your kid. Shame on you.", "YTA - So you invited someone's bullies to another person's party without any contact, where L did get bullied and abused, and but now that her mother has something you want, you're shocked that she doesn't want anything to do with you? \n\nYou're a bully. And you're raising a bully.", "YTA. \"We don't have a lot in common with her.\" Yeah, mildly insulting the way you meant it. \"I didn't know she was friends with pro athletes...\" And now she's good enough for you?

Then you chalked it up to a misunderstanding. That was no misunderstanding and you should have disciplined your kid for that.

You are being a mean girl and you are trying to use the other parent. You had no desire to have them play or do things  after the bullying happened and then got upset when her child stood up for herself and told your child no. Your kid has obviously learned from you that she thinks she can get what she wants when she wants it despite how she treats people. You thought the mother was of no need to you until you found out she's dating someone whose of interest to you.

I was a tomboy growing up,  I played rough with friends.  It was the early 90's and we were all obsessed with WWF.  You know what that didn't include? Hitting and kicking people.  We also respected if someone told us to stop.  At the very least, you have failed to teach your daughter about boundaries and consent and she's more than old enough to know better.   You made no effort to apologize until you found out that L's mom had something you wanted.  You and your daughter deserve to be excluded.   You've shown L's mom exactly who you are and she was wise to believe you.", "Man. I\u2019d suffocate with a mom like you. Or even a neighbor like you.

Because you definitely don\u2019t sound old enough to have a 7 year old. Your daughter was mean to this girl who had invited her to a special event (and you invited 2 others along). You refused to believe she could possibly have been mean because your daughter is apparently an angel.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious L and her mother want nothing to do with you (I certainly wouldn\u2019t if your child bullied my kid), by the fact you didn\u2019t get an invite again and L didn\u2019t want to play with your daughter, but you aren\u2019t getting the hint. Instead you are trying to force you and your daughter on them, not because you and K are genuinely sorry because of how you both acted, but because L\u2019s mom has something you want (access to these pro athletes).

Invited other kids to what was probably a 1-on-1 play date invitation. Of course L didn\u2019t want to play with your kids, they are friends with a bully and your daughter may have helped hurt L. \n\nYou hear that L then invites another kid to a private event and ask if you can invite yourself? You are very entitled. Your actions have consequences and the world will not just accommodate your desires because you want it to. Have some perspective. Can you imagine if your mom was playing such a big role in your childhood friend group? If you continue to helicopter and insert yourself and your wishes, you are going to damage relationships between the kids and between the parents.

Your child wasn't \"playing rough\". He and another child actively and intentionally dragged and kicked another child. Your response was to blow it off and isolate the victim. Something that was acceptable in your eyes since the victimized child was the only one with an issue from your bully of a kid.
