{"id": 19226, "submission_id": "143iwn7", "title": "AITA for adding olive oil to my girlfriend's meals?", "selftext": "I(24m) have been with my girlfriend \"Mari\"(22f) for two years. Mari is a fitness buff. She's all about healthy eating, exercise, and weightlifting and I love that about her. The problem started a few months ago.\n\nMari used to have really bad body image problems around when we first started going out. It was harmful, bad for her, and bad for her mind. She's taken incredible strides to fix her body image problems, such as therapy and slowly incorporating more food into her meals. She hasn't had a flare up of those problems for the last year and I am very proud of her.\n\nHowever as of late, I feel that her body image problems have flared up with some changes in her lifestyle. She wakes up at 5am everyday to go on a run, her portions are considerably smaller, and she goes weightlifting five days a week with pilates on the other two. To me, it seemed her intense and strict regiment was from her body image problems because she's shed off the curves she gained when she started her recovery. I really liked her curves and she's become rather lean now. I voiced my concerns to her, and she told me that she's currently on a \"cut\" following her \"bulk\".\n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I was still very worried about her, so I started sneaking olive oil into her meals. I do a majority of the cooking, but she preps the ingredients for her meals (weighs and measures for macros in her tracking app). She isn't allergic or anything, but I've been adding enough to add a considerable amount of extra calories. This has been going on for about three months and she's frustrated that she's \"plateaued\" in her progress and even gained a bit of weight - that is until she found the empty olive oil bottles in the garage bin. Mari does the grocery shopping, and she asked me about the bottles (there were about five from this week) because she does not recall buying or even seeing olive oil in our cabinets. I usually sneak the bottles off to dispose of them but hadn't had the chance, so I came clean and told her that when I cook I add some olive oil and just didn't tell her.\n\nShe got very upset with me and asked why I would do that. I told her that I voiced my concern about her fitness obsession many times but she brushed me off, so as her partner, I took measures into my own hands. She's currently staying at her sister's. How I saw it was that I was protecting my partner from another downward spiral, but my brother (who is a gym rat) said that I was an ass for doing that to her, regardless of my concerns. AITA?\n\nETA: the bottles are REALLY small. I wasn't forcing her to suck back a 500ml bottle daily. I do believe as well that two of the empty bottles were leftover from the last time.", "created_utc": 1686157760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143iwn7/aita_for_adding_olive_oil_to_my_girlfriends_meals/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have no idea if your concerns about her weight are justified or not, although I suspect they are not, but that does not matter. Let's assume she does have a serious issue with not getting enough calories. The solution to that is to work with medical professionals (doctors, therapists, etc.) to fix her eating disorder, not to sneak her extra calories.", "Big YTA. You weren\u2019t protecting shit. You just missed her curves.

Also 5 whole bottles of olive oil in 1 week?? Wow. No wonder she gained. \n\nShe wanted to be leaner and you manipulated her diet to make her gain weight. Because why? You like her more curvy? How about supporting her for making healthier choices and being proud of her?\nYou deliberately sabotaged her.

Did you say there were five bottles of olive oil from just this week?!! That is a massively unhealthy amount of oil. How are your meals not just dripping in grease? How does she not taste it? That's insane. \n\nAlso, yes, YTA. She may have an unhealthy obsession with her weight but literally sabotaging her is not the answer. You are making it worse by feeding into her trust issues with food and her body. When she cuts back on food and doesn't lose weight, what will she do? She's not gonna go \"oh well, guess this is my body now.\" She's going to restrict her diet more and resort to more extreme measures. You are 1000% an asshole and contributing to your gf's body issues by taking away her bodily autonomy and her trust in the food coming from her home. You suck.", "YTA.

It sounds like she might be suffering from orthorexia or at the very least some disordered eating tendencies and with your actions you basically ensured she cant trust food that you make for her anymore. By omitting that you added a considerable amount of calories, you inentionally MISLEAD HER AND THIS IS TRUST BREAKING BEHAVIOR. Don't be surprised if she refuses to wet what you cooked for her anymore! To her, you were intentionally sabotaging something that was clearly very important to her, her health and wellness goals!\n\nIf there is something going on with her mentally, you have ensured she can no longer be open with you about it and you have isolated her even further from resources that could help her.

Tbh, if you\u2019re adding enough calories it\u2019s probably causing her more stress bc she can\u2019t piece together why she isn\u2019t losing more weight, making her work out harder and exacerbating an already viscous and deadly cycle.\n\nBe an adult and have a conversation, explain that you\u2019re worried, offer to support her however you can within your own abilities.

You've done more to enable any eating disorder she may or may not have(yet) than any of her fitness interest has. It's also frankly disgusting you did this purely out of an aesthetic preference for her.\n\nAlso, I need you to know you've now reminded me of at least two threads involving food tampering, [one that I tracked down,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wr4xsa/oop_was_subjected_to_his_gfs_fetish_without_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and how dare you for that.", "YTA\n\nYou don't mess with people's food.\n\nYour behaviour is as disgusting as it gets.\n\nYou do not get to make decisions about her body.", "YTA HOLY FUCKING SHIT I WOULD DUMP YOU FIERCELY AND IMMEDIATELY.

That whole your body your choice applies to all aspects of a human and you thinking you get to decide what she does or doesn't put in her body simply because YOU want her to have the body type you want her to have is disgusting.  That's not even touching on the fact that she counts her macros/weighs out her meals and you adding crap to it behind her back will throw all of that off and when she doesn't get the results she's expecting, the natural course would be to modify said food intake to make it work for her goals. \n\n*How I saw it was that I was protecting my partner*\n\nYou're trying to control your partner through shady means.

Mari is a fitness buff. She's all about healthy eating, exercise, and weightlifting and I love that about her. The problem started a few months ago.\n\nMari used to have really bad body image problems around when we first started going out. It was harmful, bad for her, and bad for her mind. She's taken incredible strides to fix her body image problems, such as therapy and slowly incorporating more food into her meals. She hasn't had a flare up of those problems for the last year and I am very proud of her. \n\nHowever as of late, I feel that her body image problems have flared up with some changes in her lifestyle. She wakes up at 5am everyday to go on a run, her portions are considerably smaller, and she goes weightlifting five days a week with pilates on the other two. To me, it seemed her intense and strict regiment was from her body image problems because she's shed off the curves she gained when she started her recovery. I really liked her curves and she's become rather lean now. I voiced my concerns to her, and she told me that she's currently on a \"cut\" following her \"bulk\".\n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I was still very worried about her, so I started sneaking olive oil into her meals. I do a majority of the cooking, but she preps the ingredients for her meals (weighs and measures for macros in her tracking app). She isn't allergic or anything, but I've been adding enough to add a considerable amount of extra calories. This has been going on for about three months and she's frustrated that she's \"plateaued\" in her progress and even gained a bit of weight - that is until she found the empty olive oil bottles in the garage bin. Mari does the grocery shopping, and she asked me about the bottles (there were about five from this week) because she does not recall buying or even seeing olive oil in our cabinets. I usually sneak the bottles off to dispose of them but hadn't had the chance, so I came clean and told her that when I cook I add some olive oil and just didn't tell her.\n\nShe got very upset with me and asked why I would do that. I told her that I voiced my concern about her fitness obsession many times but she brushed me off, so as her partner, I took measures into my own hands. She's currently staying at her sister's. How I saw it was that I was protecting my partner from another downward spiral, but my brother (who is a gym rat) said that I was an ass for doing that to her, regardless of my concerns.

She's an adult, not a toddler who needs their parent to feed them with the right amount of nutriments. What next, you'll decide who's worthy enough to be her friends by deleting her contacts?

Sounds like she's been working really hard going weight lifting/pilates every day, running every day, and you're secretly tripping her up by sneaking in extra calories and fat, so she gets zero progress for her hard work, over the last 3 months. Maybe you should try to imagine how it'd feel like to work so hard for months on something and have zero progress.\n\nMaybe you need to clarify your concerns a bit? Is she anorexic? what do you mean by body image problems? what's this flare up you're referring to?\n\nIf what she's doing is truly unhealthy for her, it needs to be for another discussion. If it's really that unhealthy, get doctors, her friends/family involved. She needs to be the one to decide that she no longer wants to lose weight.

You want people to see your muscles? You go on a bit of a cut. You want bigger muscles? You go on a bulk. \n\nYou've been sabotaging her goals, when any concern you had should have gone through her and her doctors. If you couldn't get through with that, couple's therapy.

You don't get to \"Build a Girlfriend\" by forcing her to secretly adhere to your goals for her, you only get to choose to talk, stay, or get out. \n\nInstead you violated her trust in you, destroyed your relationship because you decided you knew better than her therapist and doctors, and took the nuclear option of ending your relationship because you couldn't handle the situation in a healthy manner.", "As someone training for a bodybuilding competition, FU sooooo much!\n\nEverything you wrote here is completely normal for someone competing.

She was open from the start of our relationship that she had issues and when therapy was working and she was working on her relationship with body image and food, she flourished.

These episodes look a lot like restricting eating. My partner noticed and sat me down and respectfully asked me if I was having an ED flare-up and wanted to get the scoop about what was going on and if she could help. She then trusted my answer was because of my gut issues, and I appreciated her checking in to make sure. What she DIDN\u2019T do was try to force feed me or sneak me food that I couldn\u2019t stomach. She DID make me broth to settle my stomach and let me eat when I was ready. \n\nWhat you need to realize is that EDs are a lot about control. And when other people poke into and control what you eat, the lack of control drives you nuts. Honestly, measuring macros might actually be helping her feel more comfortable with food, because at least she\u2019s aware of what she\u2019s eating. And unfortunately, the only way she\u2019s going to feel comfortable eating anything at all is if you let her do what she needs to do. Now, she knows that she\u2019s been putting something into her body that she didn\u2019t want, and she\u2019s in danger of overcorrecting HARD.
