I have heard about it from my friend a lot. My daughter invited a few girls ice skating at the beginning of the month. Kat wasn\u2019t invited and they had a text fight about it. It wasn\u2019t a pretty fight, I\u2019ve read it. Overall friendship completely over.\n\nA few days later I get a call from the principal for bullying. I got in and the evidence was the  text fight and areas were missing. Kat deleted her response so it just looked like my kid was bullying her. I showed the principal the whole thing on my daughters phone. \n\nBasically got dismissed and teachers will keep an eye on it. My daughter kinda hates Kat now.\n\nThe issue is retracted an invite to Kat for the holiday party at my home tomorrow. I got a call from my friend is pissed, saying we should help the girls make up. I told her she is banned from my home and she called me a jerk.

If you didn\u2019t have the whole story, and had your daughter not saved those messages then she would be in a lot of trouble while Kat got off scott free. Liars like that are dangerous as they don\u2019t understand just how much their lies can cost others. Kat can\u2019t be trusted so why would you or your daughter want to be associated with her? \n\nI understand the plight of your friend but she needs to look for other options and consider making some changes for the sake of her daughter.

A holiday party implies there will be a number of people there. If this girl still has bad intentions towards your daughter, it would be far too easy for her to do something to further her plans. You're right to uninvite her.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have anyone your daughter doesn't want to. \n\nIn life we pick and choose our friends. Not every relationship has to stand the test of time. No need to force them together. \n\nHonestly your friend seems a little bit like an AH. She should discipline her daughter for making up a false accusation rather than being entitled to attend your holiday party. \n\nInfo: How close are you with the parent?", "By altering the text message chain, Kat manufactured evidence in an attempt to get OP's daughter in trouble. That the principal changed course when supplied the full picture makes that clear. Kat cannot be trusted at this time.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  These girls are well past the age of being told they have to be friends because their parents are.   I remember resenting that at age 5-6, at 13 it would have been laughable.  There may have been some mean girl type behavior on both sides, but Kat editing the text exchange to make your daughter look worse puts her in the wrong here.", "Kat falsely accusing your daughter of bullying is a step too far. And if they make up, there will always be the thought in the back of your daughter\u2019s mind that she\u2019d do the same if she\u2019s upset with her", "NTA.  Kat deleted her text so she wouldn't get in trouble and your daughter would.  That's lying and manipulation.  God forbid there's issues in your home and she makes allegations against you that might make the cops or CPS show up.", "I think it was very wise to uninvite Kat and her family, so absolutely NTA. Your friend is unreasonable, in my eyes, for thinking your jobs are to make them be friends. Her daughter behaved really abysmally, for the sole purpose of making trouble for your daughter and you are right to be highly guarded, and of course your daughter should not have to have Kat in her home. \n\nIf you are indeed friends with Kat's mother, that might be salvageable but you'd have to have some type of agreement as it comes to your daughters, namely that you do not force anything between them and probably steer clear of the topic entirely. It is fair to tell Kat's mother that you and your daughter are very uncomfortable with Kat's deception and feel you need to have your guards up as a result. To the extent that Kat is 'sad' over this, unfortunately that's an important and reasonable consequence for her actions.", "So\u2026question, does your friend know about how her daughter lied trying to get your daughter in trouble?\nYou\u2019re NTA regardless, i\u2019m just trying to see whether your friend is an asshole or just misinformed", "NTA - Kat's mom is enabling her behavior, and quite honestly neither would be allowed in my home either if they pulled that shit with my kid. As we grow, sometimes people grow apart.", "NTA. If they aren't friends any more, why invite Kat anyway? And after the false bullying accusations, there is no reason at all to invite her, and every reason to ban her.", "NTA.\n\nMiddle school is tough, man. Mine is in 8th grade too and her friend group is completely different than it was in elementary. Like even her best friends have changed. And I'm kind of sad about that, because she had a good group before, but they've grown apart. \n\nBut while we can cultivate friendships between kids, we can't force them. I'm a firm believer that they can't all be friends and I'm not going to manage my daughter's friendships. So long as she's not rude or a bully or mean, I don't care if they're friends or not. They just need to be pleasant to each other.\n\nAnd they might eventually get over it. But I would let the girls lead the way. I'd just reiterate that your daughter needs to be pleasant and not talk badly about Kat to others.", "NTA, Your child comes first. She isn't hitting people, isn't being a bully, she is reacting negatively to someone reacting negatively to her. You have the right to not invite people over to your own home, and your daughter has the right to invite only friends to her activities.", "NTA. Do not try and get the girls to 'make up'. Your daughter will never trust Kat again after this, trying to force a friendship will just make things a lot worse. Kat deliberately doctored a text conversation to get your daughter in trouble for bullying, that's not something you can just forgive and forget, your daughter definitely won't. Kat needs to learn her actions have consequences, her being 'sad' is something she'll just have to cope with. \n\nI'm not sure why you invited Kat and her mum in the first place, considering the girls friendship had already ended, but it's completely understandable that you would rescind the invite after this. Kat's mother is being completely unreasonable trying to force a friendship that has already permanently ended, there is no coming back from this for Kat. Side with your daughter, she shouldn't have to be wary and uncomfortable in her own home, especially during the holidays.", "NTA. \n\nEven if both the parents did want to try to help mend the friendship then a party, with a bunch of other people, is not the place to do it. \n\nFriendships change.

I dont think a a friendship be repair after that.", "NTA.  People grow apart.  Just because you and your friend had them together in preschool doesn't mean that this will last forever.  Your daughter should have the freedom to grow away if that's what she wants.", "I mean your friend needs to address that his daughter basically tried to frame your daughter. Regardless if she is sad, this is dangerous as it shows she might go to great lengths to get your daughter in trouble. If your daughter really was at fault, that would be different.

Kat tried to get your daughter labeled a bully by lying so there is no way she should ever be in your house again.\n\nDoes her mother know she lied?", "NTA, based on this story (as we only have the one side) it doesn't matter who's popular and who's not. Kat lying to the principal and showing a \"doctored\" conversation to try and get your daughter in trouble is, itself, an attempt at bullying her through an authority figure. That wouldn't stand with me and if it were my child in that situation, I wouldn't have Kat anywhere near my kid and I'd be asking the teachers to keep an eye on Kat trying to cause problems for my kid.", "NTA.  This girl LIED to try and get your daughter in serious trouble *at school* when none of it even happened there.  Then the girls mother takes up for her and expects your daughter to just play nice. No. Absolutely not.", "NTA Kat made a false accusation against your daughter. She should not be given additional access to your daughter in her home.", "NTA. Everyone else here has already articulated why. A word of warning though, the friendship with Kat\u2019s mother may not be salvageable as a result of this. When I was younger most of my mums friends had kids my sisters age, not mine, and most of my sisters friends were the daughters of mums friends. \n\nMy mother wasn\u2019t often able to salvage her friendships if my sister and their daughters fell out. Between their child and their friend, good mothers do tend to take their children\u2019s sides. (There was a blow up in my sisters friendship group in early high school over a boy. The daughter of my mums best friend got iced out over it. Her mother obviously only saw her daughter lose all her friends and how that went down at home for her. Mama bear instincts kicked in on all sides.)\n\nMy mum actually tried to get my sister and the girl to make up, but it wasn\u2019t going to happen, and mums best friend was upset and angry at my sister for not being on her daughters side, and that anger got redirected at my mum. \n\nBest advice I can give if you want to try to save any friendship with your friend is give her time. Her daughter is hurting.", "NTA, if your daughter truly is/was bully - Kat wouldn't nor shouldn't be sad about not getting invited to your home ever again where her bully lives and spend any time there, unless it's to wreck her bully's home.

It was especially harder for my youngest because girl groups can get pretty nasty.  I'm glad there was never any drama to the level of Kat's little text shenanigans, but even though MaryJean lives right across the street the kids do not talk to each other, ever.  They were super besties in elementary school, so it is weird.\n\nLol they got paired up in science lab a couple of weeks ago and my kid was like, \"UGH, can't believe I had to work with mArYjEaN.\"", "Oh, hell no, Kat isn\u2019t going to be invited back into your home after that little stunt at school with the edited texts.

Kat's mom needs hobbies.", "So if you didn\u2019t have the proof that your daughter didn\u2019t bully kat how much trouble would your daughter have been in? did the school punish kat at all?", "The fact that she falsified evidence and tried to frame your daughter for bullying is crossing a huge line.

Do not reward this behavior. Do not subject your daughter to more bullying from these people. \n\nKat needs to learn through the consequences of her actions. You need to make sure you are also teaching your daughter that her safety and well-being comes first and to not enable toxic behavior out of social politeness.", "NTA.

Was it just the ice skating fight or was there more to it?\n\nAnd regardless of what the answer is, what does your friend have to say about all of that?

Maybe there was more there than you could see in the text messages. But you are right -- Kat didn't tell the whole story by redacting her text messages. That was under-handed of her even if your daughter bears some (or more) of the responsibility.\n\nYou don't have any responsibility to invite Kat to your house, or help in the reconciliation. That said, I do wonder about some of the backstory here:\n\n1) best friends for years growing apart and now your daughter is popular and Kat isn't, at an age where things like that are incredibly important\n\n2) your daughter excluded Kat from the ice skating (whether for good reasons or not) \n\nHave you tried to understand why Kat and your daughter aren't friends before this?

I\u2019d bet that Kat is struggling to keep friends right now, and the attempted tattling is a result of those emotions having nowhere to go.

Yes, Kat lied. Not OK. But telling your bestie since college that her kid is banned from your house comes across as extremely harsh and hurtful.  Again, just my .02. Unfortunately, they are at the age where these things happen, especially with girls, but I hope you are able to resolve things with your friend.

In my school, they were largely isolated because of their shitty behaviour. Of course this behaviour can still be seen in some environments, but the reason I bring this up is because I can see some old heads who received this type of bullying immediately projecting their own experience into this scenario as the truth, rather than actually digesting what has actually gone on during this event", "NTAH & get a better friend. she shouldn't be ok with her kid pulling that.", "Kat manipulated and edited text messages to throw your daughter under the bus as a bully.

She is acting like it\u2019s just a little misunderstanding when her daughter is demonstrating alarming abusive and vindictive manipulative and deceptive behaviours. This woman is angry her daughter can\u2019t bully your daughter inside your home. This woman is not your friend. Protect your daughter from these entitled bullies.

Kat probably felt left out when she wasn\u2019t invited to go ice skating, but your daughter has other friends too, and she has a right to spend time with them without having to invite Kat along\u2014especially when the two of them had already grown apart. Starting a text fight over not being invited, feeling entitled to an invite in the first place, and jumping straight to hurling cruelty to the point the friendship ended was a terrible response. \n\nThen Kat went a step further, and provided false evidence to try getting her into serious academic trouble. Think about what could have happened if you hadn\u2019t had those texts. The school was taking it seriously, and your daughter could have been expelled. She could have been forced away from all her friends, etc. It could have easily been a nightmare for _both_ of you. \n\nKat absolutely should not be invited to the holiday party, or any future events. What she did was completely unacceptable in every way, and there is no coming back from that. The fact your friend thinks you two need to help them \u201cmake up\u201d (and essentially brush it all under the rug) shows where she\u2019s learned this is acceptable from. She\u2019s not being taught proper morals, that she is not entitled to a friend\u2019s time, or how to take accountability. I noticed Kat has not apologized for anything she did or said, let alone admitted she was wrong. If she\u2019s \u201cextremely sad\u201d she has a funny way of showing it. There\u2019s an extremely high chance she\u2019s also manipulating and lying to her mother. Are you sure your friend knows what actually happened and understands how bad it could have been for you? \n\nKat\u2019s behavior has been incredibly mean-spirited and disrespectful, and I\u2019m certain it\u2019s a major part of the reason they began to grow apart in the first place.", "NTA. Even if your daughter was willing to coexist with this girl, the kid made a false accusation of bullying against your daughter. Screw that, she gets no more chances to lie about your family.\n\nYour friend needs to recognise that there could have been very serious consequences from that accusation and there's not really any making up to be done after that.", "NTA. This has gone past a friendship fading out. Kat showed herself to be an imminent threat to your daughter when she tried to set your daughter up as a bully to the school administration. Even the accusation, though proven false, has put your daughter on the school's radar.

It seems as though your daughter just doesn't want to be friends with Kat anymore, and maybe Kat is upset by that. It's not up to you or your friend who your daughter is friends with, so I think you did the right thing.\nI wouldn't let this come between you and your friend, though, so maybe just talk it out and say you don't want to force a friendship on your daughter.\n\nIf your daughter comes to you and says she wants to make up with Kat, then you could assist with that. If she has no interest of making up, which after the accusation I can understand why she wouldn't want to, then maybe it's just time for her and Kat to move on and find friends that better suit their personalities.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, 8th grade can be pretty rough", "Personally I think this is an opportunity to teach these kids that even though they arent friends anymore they can still treat each other with respect. They can still be civil and although they are both young, a lesson like this can go a long way for future relationships. Talk to your friend, both you and her start having these talks with the girls, maybe in the future go to lunch and see if they can put this aside and just be \"chill\" with each other. This is a crappy age and one thing I've learned after having 3 kids of my own who are now adults, this popular thing could be here today gone tomorrow. Teach understanding. Teach treat ppl how you would like to be treated. Your friends daughter too.", "INFO: What exactly was said during the text fight?", "Info: What did Kats mom say about Kat deleting her messages trying to make your daughter look like a bully?\n\nWithout knowing either of the girls and thinking about the context of their social status it's typically the popular girls who ARE the bullies. I'm not saying your daughter's a bully but if before the drama she was excluding Kat I can see how that could be perceived as bullying.", "I don\u2019t think any judgement can be made without knowing what was said during their text fight. Just because Kat deleted her side of the argument doesn\u2019t mean your daughter wasn\u2019t being cruel.", "NTA/ESH- I agree that is it totally important to support your own daughter. However, I think this could have been a valuable learning experience for the both girls. \nBy canceling the invitation for the other girl you are effectively letting your daughter dictate your own relationships and events. She doesn\u2019t have to like your friend\u2019s daughter and they don\u2019t have to be friends, but they both need to respect each other as human beings and be decent to one another. They also need to accept and respect that their moms are friends. \nThat said, from what you were saying, it sounds like the other girl does owe your daughter an apology. However, I don\u2019t doubt that there is more going on that you aren\u2019t aware of. Middle school is no joke these days (not that it ever was!) If your daughter became popular, and her former friend did not, there\u2019s no doubt some resentment there and likely bad blood/attitudes on both sides. Kids that age act very different with newfound friend groups in school than they do at home. Middle school is like a right of passage, with kids trying out all different ways of \u201cbeing\u201d to fit in, stand out, prove themselves, or just look better than the person next to them.

My daughter kinda hates Kat now.\n\nThe issue is retracted an invite to Kat for the holiday party at my home tomorrow. I got a call from my friend is pissed, saying we should help the girls make up.

They bully people who are socially lower pecking order, do it in front of their peers, and do it to demonstrate and reinforce their superior social status.

Op said that Kat was sad about the friendship collapsing. Which would also be the case if her friend started to bully her.
