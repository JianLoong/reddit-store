It\u2019s really that simple.", "YTA, soft one\n\nThe current situation isn't \"best\" for anyone, son and grandkids.  Instead of a being a roadblock you should be facilitating a reconciliation with therapy and family counseling instead of continued alienation.  Your attempts to protect your grandkids I think are misguided in this case.", "NTA. Your grandchildren are entitled to set the pace of any reconciliation with their father, not him (or even you). Those kids lost both parents at what, 7 and 5? I can't imagine how devastating that must have been for them. Kenny has no right to demand anything of them and he is the one responsible for the alienation, no one else. You could tell him that if he keeps pushing he could lose the kids for good and it would be his own fault.", "NTA.  Kenny gave up his right to have a say when he made you legal guardian of his children.  It's great that they are getting closer, but he doesn't get to make decisions for your family like this.  Have a good holiday!!", "NTA. He can travel next year with all of you if they get closer. However, he threatened you with different things tk force you. This is a hard no from me. He doesn't get to make threats and go. He will just understand he can do it again and again.\n\nTake your papers that prove you have custody of your kids. If he does anything, cut him off.", "NTA-He cannot just demand to go with you. He made his choice. Now he needs to respect their choices.", "NTA - he made his bed, let him lie in it", ">I feel like an obstacle for them to reconcile. \n\nYou are not being an obstacle. You are protecting your grandchildren's boundaries, which is absolutely what you should be doing.\n\nYour son cannot expect this reconciliation to happen according to his agenda. It is up to his children whether/when they want to see him. He needs to respect that and not rush them. If your son tries to force this he will only push them away. He may think that he's at a decisive moment for reconciliation, but your grandchildren are obviously not so sure. He really needs to back off and be patient if he wants to regain their trust.\n\nWell done for being your grandkids' rock OP. Keep doing what you're doing. \ud83c\udfc5\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. He can continue reconciling with them when you return.  They don't want him there, he needs to respect that (and respecting that will also contribute to their reconciliation).  Remind him that they don't HAVE to reconcile with him. They are being gracious to him by even giving him a chance.", "NTA do what's best for the kids not the person who abandoned them.", "NTA. This isn't about Kenny. It's about the kids. If the math is correct, kiddos were 6 and 4 when you became their legal guardian. And for 7 years, you're the only parent they've ever known. Kenny doesn't get to walk in and decide he's now ready to be a parent and that the kids should be running to him with open arms. I think you're doing the right thing to take things slow, and if Kenny keeps pushing, the kids will see that and reject him.", "NTA. You respected your grandchildren's decision. Also, there's a big possibility that making him come with y'all will just negatively affect their healing relationship. Don't force the children. They're just kids; kids mean no when they say no.", "YTA. You have been an amazing and wonderful parent but I just don't understand why you are choosing to be so punitive, like not even letting him know you were going away. It really isn't your action but rather your feelings that I question.", "NTA. Your son acted so selfishly and now just expects things to work on his timetable because he\u2019s ready\u2026nope. I cannot imagine how hard it was for your grandchildren to lose both of their parents like that and they are lucky to have you. Trust your gut and continue to seek guidance from the therapist, you clearly have the best interest of those kids at heart. Your son, I\u2019m not so sure if he understands the wreckage he\u2019s caused.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Molly passed away 7 years ago and it... tore my son apart as Molly was his world and he didn't deal well with her death for years. \n\nA year after her death, Kenny came to my house and begged me to take care of his children, as he couldn't take it anymore with work and grief.\n\n I demanded that he give me all legal means to take care of my grandchildren, he waived his rights and pays child-support. He also gave up visiting. I am fully and sole guardian of my grandchildren. \n\nAfter 4 years, Kenny came back saying that he wanted to have contact with his children.\n\nI allowed him to see my grandchildren (with their consent) a little by little and they're really getting closer but my grandchildren still haven't forgiven him \n\nSo...\n\nKenny has been showing signs that he wants to spend Christmas with us. But I had already decided that I was going to travel with my grandchildren to the beach and honestly, I don't need to communicate any decision from me to my son about my grandchildren, so I didn't comment on that. I asked if they wanted to spend it with their father and they both said no and for me it's enough.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, he came to visit and mentioned that we could spend Christmas together in his new house. \n\nI decided to be frank and say that we would spend Christmas at the beach. He looked shocked and asked if he could go, I said no. Then he started saying that I couldn't travel with his children without him knowing (I can) and that I should at least allow him to accompany us, as he is at a decisive moment in the reconciliation between him and the children.\n\n I said my decision is based on what's best for my grandchildren and these are the consequences of leaving the kids with me and being away so I wouldn't help with that. \n\nHe started yelling, saying he would sue (I'm clean) as this was \"parental\" alienation and that I should prefer reconcile our family. \n\nTomorrow I'm traveling with my grandchildren and Kenny sent a huge text begging me to allow him to have this moment with him (he's gotten even closer to them this year). \n\nI don't know, I respect my grandchildren's decision not to want their father, but I feel like an obstacle for them to reconcile. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for my english.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was still thinking about his children\u2019s best interest while he was in the deep end of his misery.\n\nHe should have visited them but severely depressed people don\u2019t make the best decisions. I wouldn\u2019t blame a woman with PPD with child abandonment while she sought treatment. Your son got back for his children when he got better.\n\nYou asked for the custody as a condition of your help. He didn\u2019t just leave them and go MIA. I understand you wanted legal protection in case your son became deranged but he didn\u2019t give you any problems anywhere in the process. \n\nYou looked out for your grandchildren but didn\u2019t look out for your son\u2019s interests. You should have made visits a condition of your help instead of full custody and child support. You let down your son when he was at his lowest. Sounds like he took all the responsibility he could. Do you think you did everything right? Why are you not actively helping your son reconcile with his children instead of continuing to plan a life without him?", "NAH.\n\nYou had previous plans and given the situation, I can understand you being reluctant to include him, especially if the kids aren't up for it.\n\nI also understand him wanting to reconnect with his kids, but he needs to understand that you know them best and let you \u2013 and them \u2013 set the pace in that process.\n\nAnd really, this one vacation is not going to make or break their relationship.", "Take them to the beach.  You are essentially their father, and props to you for stepping up when these kids had hit rock bottom with the death of one parent and the abandonment of the other.   \nNTA", "NTA but don't you want your so to reconnect with his kids? While yes he was wrong for leaving them but he left them in your care where he knew they would be taken care of and has financially been supporting the decision he made through paying child  support. Grief is a terrible thing and now that he is on the other side of it he is realizng and attempting to step back up as a father. While I don't think he should be demanding he should go on the trip I think you should have a talk with your grandchildren about giving him a chance and lead by example by giving him some credit as well. Good luck and I hope you and your grandkids enjoy the holiday.", "NTA I was expecting some kind of weird kidnapping story.\nYou ARE their legal guardian, do whatever you want. There will be lots more Christmases to spend with your son.", "NTA! You are doing everything you can to balance a very complex situation. Time heals wounds not one sided opinions from your son. He was absent for years and I would imagine it will take years more to fix what has been broken. Have a blast with the grandkids over the Holiday break.", "NTA Kenny chose to walk away from his kids and come back years later. He's also old enough to know that actions have consequences. You've asked your grandkids if they want to spend Christmas with their father and they've said no, so he needs to accept that his kids don't want to spend Christmas with him and you've already made plans. \n\nThere's nothing stopping him from finding his own accommodation in the beach area that you'll be staying. Time for him to grow up and realise that his kids will never have the same relationship with him that they once had.\n\nI'd also look into getting the grandkids in to counselling so they can have an independent person to help them with the reconnecting with their father.", "Her grandchildren said no what more do you expect?", "No nastiness intended toward you at all, but I don't understand why Grandparent owes this man anything.  It's not like the son said \"Can you please take the kids for 6 months while I heal.\"  The son dropped them off and couldn't even be bothered to visit.  I can't imagine poor Grandparent having to explain at every birthday, school event, or holiday why Dad doesn't want to see them anymore after their mother died.", "The children said they didn't want to spend time with their bio father. He does not have a right for the children so knowing this is really not his business.", "Yeah let\u2019s go with what the man who abandoned his children wants because he was grieving\u2026 guess what so was his kids and they had to grieve the loss of  there father  too but now because he wants to play daddy after years of nothing, he gets his way even if the children don\u2019t want that. \nThis man has had it his way far too much these are no longer his children they are OPs and he gets what he gets and should be greatful for that", "I agree with everything you say which is why I wish there was a \"maybe take a breath\" category. What would be best for the kids is if there can be some small signs of warmth between their grandparent and their father. Right now I fear they feel guilty for wanting to see him. To be clear I do not believe he belongs on the beach vacation, too much too soon.", "I am not talking about legality, but rather about what may be good for the kids. Not the beach holiday, it's just too much. Just the general feeling of anger.", "His children have seemed to become more accepting and closer.", "But it's an adaptation. They are all adapting. I think OP's anger comes from the fact her son abandoned the kids and is now making demands and threats. I would be frustrated too.", "Yeah and his children have said NO about him spending Christmas with them", "I totally understand the anger and the frustration, but there is just nothing that can be done about that. At least he knew he was not fit to be a father at that point.", "I know and was not talking about Christmas...way too much.", "Oh yeah I\u2019m talking about what the post is about too much"]}
