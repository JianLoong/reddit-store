Normally i wait to add new toys to the rotation but sometimes my excitement gets the better of me .\n\nMy aunt recently visited and brought with her one of the noise and light up firetrucks that are about a foot tall. i told her how much i love it and how much he would like it. i immediately went to put it in my closet and she stopped me and asked why i wasn't giving it to V.\n\nI explained to her what I said above, that I rotate toys and i would give him this next rotation because he already got a fun new light up noises toy. she went OFF! she claimed that i was a horrible mother for depriving my son of toys and that children should choose what to play with. when she said that I became kind of snarky and said, when he can wipe his own ass he can choose his own toys and that might have made me kind of an a\\*\\*.\n\nshe ripped the firetruck from my hands and dropped it Infront of my son saying that he will ALWAYS have access to any toys she buys for him and they were except from the rotation. I said no, I'm not going to remember all the toys you bought and I don't want him having a bunch of sound toys at the same time because it overwhelms me and him. she said if I don't exempt him she will take back all the toys she got him and bring them to her house so he can play. I told her to take the truck and leave, she did but not without calling me an abuser and a horrible b word and mothers.

They don\u2019t get to decide what you do in your own home- your son is not being deprived of anything. You\u2019ve found a way to keep him happy while fighting the society pressure to constantly buy new things. Good for you.", "NTA - There's a theory in Montessori methods that having too much stuff to choose from is overwhelming & can negatively impact children. \n\nYou do what you need to for tour kids.", "Is your aunt the toddler in this story?  Making up rules in someone else's home, ripping items from someone else's hands, and throwing an all out temper tantrum?    \n\n\nNTA and there's not a doubt in my mind.  You are the mother, you get to choose how to parent.  That's it.  That's the whole story.  PS - I rotated my toddlers toys and they survived.", "NTA, this is just silly. He has plenty of toys to play with and you\u2019re getting more use out of them this way. Taking something he loves away while he\u2019s playing with it is significantly different than a toy rotation", "Keep your child away from your Aunt\n\nShe just told you point blank she plans on undermining you as a parent\n\nNTA", "NTA but you could have let him play with while she was there for politeness and then put it away later. She was being nice and wanted to see the joy. \n\nBut then she was a jerk and ruined it.", "NTA. This is your way of parenting and if she won\u2019t respect that then she can leave. She acted very rudely", "NTA\n\nYour aunt has some anger serious issues, if you have a system with your child that works. Aka rotating the toys, then what\u2019s the harm in the child waiting another week\u2026? It is not abuse.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you're doing is pretty normal, and your aunt is an asshole. We used to do much the same thing when our kids were little. We didn't have a strict rotation schedule, but would get out things that hadn't been out for a while. \n\nWe'd have always put a new toy immediately in to service, though, but wouldn't feel obliged to keep the \"rotation\" the same.", ">she said if I don't exempt him she will take back all the toys she got him and bring them to her house so he can play.\n\nDon't threaten me with a good time! Loud toys that live at someone else's house? That is a no lose situation right there. Make sure all the messy ones go with her, too. Get some of those awful V-tech toys that suddenly start to make sounds even when no one is near, and send those. \n\nFor real, though, NTA. She sounds like a person who doesn't get to come over anymore.", "ESH\n\nIf you put the truck into rotation later, fine, but if someone shows up with a gift for your son they should have the satisfaction of giving it to him and watching him play with it.", "NTA\n I did this when my kids were very little. And this method also helps kids with adhd  . She is just upset she didn't get the experience she wanted. Tell her to not buy him anything then. Kids will get enough toys.", "ESH. First, your idea of rotating the toys is a good one. Also, your aunt completely overreacted to your rotation plan. \n\nBut when a friend or relative goes to the time and expense of buying a child a toy, they want to see the kid play with it. They want to see him having fun with it. It was really rude of you to take that toy and stick it in the closet instead of giving it to your son. You could have let him play with it while your aunt was there, then stuck either it or the SW toy back in the closet for future rotation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAunt needs to mind her own business.", "NTA, except that i probably would have let him at least play with it while she was there and then put it into the rotation. If you took a gift to a friends house and they stuck it straight into the closet you\u2019d probably be confused too.", "NTA, but. : it would have been more appropriate to go ahead and give him the new toy and then put it into the rotation with everything else.  It's kind of weird to accept a gift for your son but then immediately put it away.  Your sister bought him a gift and wanted to see him enjoy it.  It would have been more gracious of you to allow that.", "Well. \n\nIt was kinda rude to not give him the toy for a bit since she just got it for him\n\nBut she completely overreacted so \n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "Gift giving may be her love language and you stomped on it lol", "ESH. Yes, rotating toys is a great method at that age, you aren\u2019t depriving him. AND you should have been gracious and let him play with the fire truck right away while aunt was there. Just for her visit.", "NTA. ive heard rotating toys is good for the reasons you listed. and even if it wasnt, its your kid you do what you want (except abuse)", "The only reason to gift new parents' kids toys that make sounds is to mess with them. Like, as a joke gift. If you seriously do this without clearing it with the parents first, you're a major AH right from the get go. \n\nNTA", "ESH. Rotating toys is fine but that's not what you did to be TA.\n\nIf someone brings a gift to your child the polite thing to do is most definitely not to put it in a fucking cupboard and say \"he can have it on the next rotation\" like sticking to the rotation program is life or death.\n\nIt's a gift - gift givers expect to see their gift be received by the child, and it would not have caused anyone any harm whatsoever to act normal and do this.\n\nYour aunt was fucking rude and way OTT but in fairness she was responding to your rude treatment of her.", "NTA\nYour child and home, your rules.\nAlso, we do something similar with our son. Especially around birthdays or holidays. They get so much stuff, they get overwhelmed and don't know what to play with.\nWe let him open the gifts and the next day, we will put some away and then change it up after a bit or add something.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad strategy for most toys, but I think it\u2019s probably not the best for gifts. \n\nI\u2019m sure people want to see your son enjoy the presents they give him - not to see them go directly into a closet. \n\nYour aunt\u2019s reaction puts her more in the AH camp IMO, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if others don\u2019t really want to buy gifts for the closet. I\u2019d see if you can come up with a way for friends and family to actually give your son gifts directly.", "YTA. I agree with the rotation, but she gave him a present. Most gift givers like to see the recipient enjoy it for a bit. You could have allowed him to play with it while Aunt was there. Then later on put it in the closet to include in the next rotation.", "NTA \nWe do toy rotation too (more like toys that are not used that week get put away and come back later) because my kids have too many toys.   Maybe your aunt should have a ban on new toys unless it's a celebration?  That's we've had to do with my in-laws that always brought things for my kids.", "NTA I think that's a brilliant idea and this way he gets to enjoy all the toys longer because first he's not easily bored by them and second they'll in general last longer. I barely gift my niblings any toys cause I know they'll get plenty from other people. Instead I ask my sister what they really need (clothes, shoes, school stuff) and take my share on that. I think what you are doing is very responsible and kids don't need too many (useless) toys.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with toy rotation, but many parents do. A difference in parenting philosophy doesn\u2019t make you a bad mom.", "NTA, I\u2019m a toddler teacher and have a degree in child development, you\u2019re doing great.", "Asshole? no. But here is what you did wrong. Your aunt probably spend a good amount of money on that truck, thus she wanted to see the joy of the son as he plays with it. My grandma was like that, she would save up money to buy stuff for my cousin just to see the sparkle on her eyes.  \nOn her last years, she would tell us stories how we smiled laughed with joy with the toys or snacks she got for us.   \nFor you, right thng would be just making the rotation early and let your aunt her little memory she would potentially cherish for rest of her (probably) limited years.  \n\n\nYet again, rotation is a good idea and aunt had overreacted.", "ESH. Toy rotations are great, we do them. But if a relative brings a gift we thank them and allow the children to play with it. It can be put away the next day. That\u2019s the polite thing to do. Your aunt was still completely out of line demanding that V have access to it all the time and basically everything else she said.", "NTA. \n\nI have a nearly two year old I do a similar thing with as we are currently living at her grandmothers. She overreacted IMO.", "NTA your aunt is way out of line here I would give your aunt a time out for her behavior. Plus like everyone else to see the toy rotating is a good thing plus like you said you wouldn\u2019t be able to remember every toy that you get him plus the more toys he has the quicker he\u2019ll lose interest in them and then that money spent on the toys will have been wasted. \nAlso if the aunt continues this behavior I would recommend limiting on when and where she can visit your son.", "NTA. Your aunt is being ridiculous. Lots of parents rotate toys. It doesn\u2019t hurt the kids at all. Ignore her.", "NTA. I|T's really sensible - as you say, it means your son doesn't get bored and gets the 'fun' of unfamiliar toys. I assume that o there's something he's really fond off you would let him keep that out if he missed it, and as he gets older he'll have more choice in what's in and what's out, but it sounds like a great way to avoid being overwhelmed. \n\nWhen my younger sister was small, our area had a toy library which worked on a similar basis - you could borrow toys for a week or two so kids got to play with more of a variety of things . It sounds as though you are doing something similar on a personal level!", "NTA. Kids can get overstimulated and toys that are loud and bright can do that to some. aunt needs to respect your boundary. However, if someone gave my kid a gift, I would let them give it to my kid and then when rotation time happens, it can go into rotation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're the parent, you can manage your kids toys however you want. No light-up toys? You're the parent. Only Star Wars toys? You're the parent. As long as you are caring for your sons health and safety, toy management is a non-issue. \n\nSure, you could appease your aunt by letting her see her toy played with when it's given, but nothing about this justifies her response.

We rotated toys for our kids and we still do it for our cats (because our cats are just four legged toddlers). We also had a rule that super noisy toys eventually got \"operated on\" because there is only so many times you can handle Elmo singing \"On the road again\" without losing your mind.

I would also no longer accept anything from her nor ever allow your son at her house.", "NTA. Your aunt has forgotten what kids are like. Babies can get overwhelmed by too much stimulation. Too many toys, too may choices. Your way, every week is a new experience. I'm sure if your son has a special toy or stuffed animal, you don't take that away. Keep doing what you are doing. It is a great idea.", "ESH - rotating toys is great practice, especially for really small children. You aren\u2019t doing anything wrong by having that policy.\n\nYou did commit a social faux pas by immediately stuffing the truck in the closet. When someone brings a toy as a gift to your house, they expect to see the kid play with it. They want the satisfaction of knowing that child is enjoying something that they spent time and money selecting specifically for that child. Seeing the kid playing with the toy is the equivalent of a kid who can\u2019t say \u201cthank you\u201d yet giving that kind of acknowledgment.\n\nYour aunt handled the rejection - because sticking it in the closet, even if you had a logical reason, looked like a rejection - really badly.\n\nI think you should offer an apology for the way you received the gift. Don\u2019t back down on your rotation policy, just acknowledge that you hurt her feelings and promise to handle things differently in the future. That can look like letting your kid play with the toy for a little while in front of the gift giver and then moving it wherever in the rotation schedule makes sense to you.", "NTA - I always did toy rotation because my family spoiled the bejezzus out of my kid. If anyone complained I would have told them to kick rocks as well. If the only way your aunt can show love is to buy crap then her love is kind of crap.", "NTA. This is smart as hell and seems like it makes him enjoy his toys more and get extra life out of them. Who cares if you wait a couple days or weeks to give him a new toy as long as he gets it eventually?", "NTA. Only reason I can understand her being upset is if she wanted the joy of seeing him play with the toy right away.\n\nOne thing I want to caution though - My mom apparently used to hide toys and then throw them away if I didn't ask for them. I didn't realize and thought I was just misplacing/losing things. I lost a lot of my favorite toys that way and felt really bad about it. This situation is different but I just want to caution how you handle it so your son doesn't get confused/frustrated as he gets older.", "Oh wow! She was way outta line. You are being super reasonable and keeping the chaos of kids toys to a min! You are NTA, but your aunt is a huge one", "NTA. Not at all.\n\nBut, I would say, thay when someone buys a kid a toy/pressie they like to see the childs reaction. It's a bit like a thank you for them. In that regard you may have handled the politeness of the situation better ams let him have the truck and put it away later.\n\nBut it's genuinely a great idea.", "NTA- We rotate toys too. It's super common with parents.", "NTA. This is fantastic idea, toy rotations are extremely common these days. Keeps things fun and fresh for him, he also has NO clue and will not for a couple years, he'll just play with what is immediately visible and be none the wiser.\n\nEspecially agree on the sound/noise making toys, hard limit in our house of only a couple at a time. We found everyone seems to gravitate to those as gifts because they seem cool, oooh lights and sounds! No one considers that the parents want to smash them against the wall after the 473rd repetition of the dang song that's hard-coded into the device, lol.", "You sound like a fantastic parent - both thoughtful and principled. Congratulations and NTA", "Bruuuuuuuuh , most preschools and child development centers do this anyway.  Experts suggest certain changes to classroom and play areas  in order to engage kids on multiple subjects and concepts over time. I'm my classrooms, I often changed out the sensory table on a monthly basis with different toys and materials that reflected the curriculum or any upcoming holidays/seasonal changes.\nMany child psychologists and other child development experts consider toy rotation to be a great way to avoid over stimulation and \"too many toys\" tantrums.  It also reduces wear and tear on toys and helps them last longer. I usually use the time when certain toys are rotated out to deep clean them too!\nSince your little bean is nearly out of preschool/kindergarten age, he'll soon be more adept at making decisions on which kinds of toys he prefers and that'll help in paring down. But yeah. NTA. In fact, awesome job, mama bear!", "Agreed, however the crazy aunt has showed her true colors. The name-calling was bad enough, but I would be going LC or NC with anyone who could so easily call me an abuser.", "Came here to say this. In all the years I did trainings for early childhood education, it was recommended to rotate toys for this reason and as OP reasoned, to keep toys new interesting and fresh. Besides I doubt OP rotates EVERY toy, there's probably at least 2 or 3 things that are staple favorites that are kept out of rotation.", "I can say with certainty that for me it did negatively impact me.", "Montessori educator turned stay at home dad for a while. My toddlers toys are sorted by type on our shelves and we will rotate things in and out, both for variety and to introduce new toys as his development progresses. Having it organized and replacing the toys to their spot every night means that he has a consistent environment and knows where things are.

Toy rotation is so smart but I think with gifts you have to make an exception", "i realize now that was kind of mean, i wasnt really thinking about how it might have been for her seeing the gift she just got him put away without being touched.", "i agree, looking back with a calmer head i was a little bit mean. i probably should have let him play with it. i usually only let him have one or two sound toys out at once because I cant handle more but i shouldn't be basing his gifts on what i prefer, and next time someone gets him a gift, lesson learned, put it away after they leave.", "yeah I've gotta be a bit more flexible with his schedule, im aware as he grows hes not going to be as cooperative and ive learned my lesson. let them play with the gift then decide if i'm going to put it away", "ive told my family, after the Christmas fiasco, to ask what he needs before getting anything, obviously gifts are welcome every once in a while, but sometimes it's too much. my aunt doesn't live very close by so when she does send packages, she says it's because she can't spend time with him so I've let it go more than others. also, hes the first grandson, great grandson, and greatgreat grandson on both sides plus the first baby in the family in 10yrs so you can imagine the kind, and amount, of stuff i got.", "how come you are being downvoted? its weird.", "It sounds like you have a very skewed idea of gift giving, like the aunt. \n\nGiving gifts because of what you get out of it is very strange to me.", "I appreciate your honesty!  i definitely have learned that i should let him play with the toy while they are there then just put it away that night. lesson learned and ingrained in my brain lol.", "this is honestly the first time she's ever done anything like this, i don't see her very often but she loves my son and will send him packages every so often with stuff so i really wouldn't remember her stuff from others.", "oh trust me, I've already had to take batteries out of some of the \"wonderful\" toys. luckily he's so young he doesn't notice, but i know im going to have to get used to the most annoying sounds as he grows. just hoping for a few more months of peace lol", "yes, a few stuffed animals and some of his more sentimental toys he gets all the time!", "People with these kinds of strings attached are so weird to me. I\u2019ve been the mom and the aunt in this scenario. I\u2019m perfectly fine getting a text from my sister 6 weeks after I gave a gift to let me know how much my nieces/nephews are enjoying the toy.\n\nI\u2019m not giving gifts for recognition or for some sort of \u201cBest Aunt\u201d award, I just want a child I love to enjoy something, whether it\u2019s today or next month. \n\nYou\u2019re fine.", "Sharing happiness and joy is not \"what you get out of it\" we put thought in our gifts. What would make the people on the recieving end happy? Why, wanting to see the exciment of it makes it \"get somethng out of it\" gifts are not soulless material aids you give the people in need. I am not saying aunt was right about how she reacted and acted but giving a gift to someone, specially to a baby and it ending up in a closet is not a good feeling.", "Exactly! If you included those in the rotation, even though they held the most comfort value, then I'd say there's a bit of a issue. But you don't! You give him access to his comfort items, while keeping his environment fresh. You're doing all the right things \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "That was my one question/concern. NTA.

I can see having to renegotiate this routine when he's got some real object permanence, but until then this is a great idea.", "I'm a parent of 5, 3 and 1 year old and I rotate their toys out all the time. Their school does too. And the kids section of the library. Your aunt is not only the A, but crazy too. Its actually pretty standard...", "Is knowing/hearing that someone is happy not enough? Do you need to see it? What if they don\u2019t like it, and they have to pretend for your sake? Was it worth it? \n\nGifts are given to enrich someone\u2019s life, for their enjoyment. If you can\u2019t be satisfied giving a gift without the affirmation of the recipient\u2019s visible happiness and joy, then yes, I think that perspective is skewed.", "Great point - daycare, preschool, kindergarten and grade 1 classes, all have rotated toys.", "Where the hell did i say they need to \"pretend\"? Stop putting words in my mouth for starters.   \n\n\nSecondly, do you know what is most direct method to enrich someones life and enjoyment? Give them money. It is the fastest method.   \nIts not about being \"satisfied\" its about being happy. There have been times people give gifts even without seeing the person. I did at least.  \n\n\nNow, the point is, can you argue its NOT better to not see their happiness and joy? Of course that god damn aunt would love to see her grand nephew happy because of her, that would make her happy and probably be a moment that would make her week and maybe even rest of her life. I am not saying OP is the ASShole for having a rotation or somethng, and i am not defending aunt for how did she react as you realize.  \n\n\nWhat i am saying is, giving the kid the god damn toy and sharing the moment of joy and exciment would be the better option for everyone here.   \n\"but sometimes my excitement gets the better of me .\"  op had the same feeling, op made the exception of skipping her own rules to see the moment earlier. Let the damn kid have the toy for the day, and put it on the closet the next day and let the aunt share the moment. Is this too hard of a concept to grasp?"]}
