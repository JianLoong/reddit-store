Normally i wait to add new toys to the rotation but sometimes my excitement gets the better of me .\n\nMy aunt recently visited and brought with her one of the noise and light up firetrucks that are about a foot tall. i told her how much i love it and how much he would like it. i immediately went to put it in my closet and she stopped me and asked why i wasn't giving it to V.\n\nI explained to her what I said above, that I rotate toys and i would give him this next rotation because he already got a fun new light up noises toy. she went OFF! she claimed that i was a horrible mother for depriving my son of toys and that children should choose what to play with. when she said that I became kind of snarky and said, when he can wipe his own ass he can choose his own toys and that might have made me kind of an a\\*\\*.\n\nshe ripped the firetruck from my hands and dropped it Infront of my son saying that he will ALWAYS have access to any toys she buys for him and they were except from the rotation. I said no, I'm not going to remember all the toys you bought and I don't want him having a bunch of sound toys at the same time because it overwhelms me and him. she said if I don't exempt him she will take back all the toys she got him and bring them to her house so he can play. I told her to take the truck and leave, she did but not without calling me an abuser and a horrible b word and mothers.

You\u2019ve found a way to keep him happy while fighting the society pressure to constantly buy new things. Good for you.", "NTA - There's a theory in Montessori methods that having too much stuff to choose from is overwhelming & can negatively impact children. \n\nYou do what you need to for tour kids.", "Is your aunt the toddler in this story?  Making up rules in someone else's home, ripping items from someone else's hands, and throwing an all out temper tantrum?    \n\n\nNTA and there's not a doubt in my mind.  You are the mother, you get to choose how to parent.  That's it.  That's the whole story.  PS - I rotated my toddlers toys and they survived.", "NTA, this is just silly. He has plenty of toys to play with and you\u2019re getting more use out of them this way. Taking something he loves away while he\u2019s playing with it is significantly different than a toy rotation", "Keep your child away from your Aunt\n\nShe just told you point blank she plans on undermining you as a parent\n\nNTA", "NTA but you could have let him play with while she was there for politeness and then put it away later. She was being nice and wanted to see the joy. \n\nBut then she was a jerk and ruined it.", "NTA. This is your way of parenting and if she won\u2019t respect that then she can leave. She acted very rudely", "NTA\n\nYour aunt has some anger serious issues, if you have a system with your child that works. Aka rotating the toys, then what\u2019s the harm in the child waiting another week\u2026? It is not abuse.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you're doing is pretty normal, and your aunt is an asshole. We used to do much the same thing when our kids were little. We didn't have a strict rotation schedule, but would get out things that hadn't been out for a while. \n\nWe'd have always put a new toy immediately in to service, though, but wouldn't feel obliged to keep the \"rotation\" the same.", ">she said if I don't exempt him she will take back all the toys she got him and bring them to her house so he can play.\n\nDon't threaten me with a good time! Loud toys that live at someone else's house? That is a no lose situation right there. Make sure all the messy ones go with her, too. Get some of those awful V-tech toys that suddenly start to make sounds even when no one is near, and send those. \n\nFor real, though, NTA. She sounds like a person who doesn't get to come over anymore.", "ESH\n\nIf you put the truck into rotation later, fine, but if someone shows up with a gift for your son they should have the satisfaction of giving it to him and watching him play with it.", "NTA\n I did this when my kids were very little. And this method also helps kids with adhd  . She is just upset she didn't get the experience she wanted. Tell her to not buy him anything then. Kids will get enough toys.", "ESH. First, your idea of rotating the toys is a good one. Also, your aunt completely overreacted to your rotation plan. \n\nBut when a friend or relative goes to the time and expense of buying a child a toy, they want to see the kid play with it. They want to see him having fun with it. It was really rude of you to take that toy and stick it in the closet instead of giving it to your son. You could have let him play with it while your aunt was there, then stuck either it or the SW toy back in the closet for future rotation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAunt needs to mind her own business.", "NTA, except that i probably would have let him at least play with it while she was there and then put it into the rotation. If you took a gift to a friends house and they stuck it straight into the closet you\u2019d probably be confused too.", "NTA, but. : it would have been more appropriate to go ahead and give him the new toy and then put it into the rotation with everything else.  It's kind of weird to accept a gift for your son but then immediately put it away.  Your sister bought him a gift and wanted to see him enjoy it.  It would have been more gracious of you to allow that.", "Well. \n\nIt was kinda rude to not give him the toy for a bit since she just got it for him\n\nBut she completely overreacted so \n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "Gift giving may be her love language and you stomped on it lol", "ESH. Yes, rotating toys is a great method at that age, you aren\u2019t depriving him. AND you should have been gracious and let him play with the fire truck right away while aunt was there. Just for her visit.", "NTA. ive heard rotating toys is good for the reasons you listed. and even if it wasnt, its your kid you do what you want (except abuse)", "The only reason to gift new parents' kids toys that make sounds is to mess with them. Like, as a joke gift. If you seriously do this without clearing it with the parents first, you're a major AH right from the get go. \n\nNTA", "ESH. Rotating toys is fine but that's not what you did to be TA.\n\nIf someone brings a gift to your child the polite thing to do is most definitely not to put it in a fucking cupboard and say \"he can have it on the next rotation\" like sticking to the rotation program is life or death.\n\nIt's a gift - gift givers expect to see their gift be received by the child, and it would not have caused anyone any harm whatsoever to act normal and do this.\n\nYour aunt was fucking rude and way OTT but in fairness she was responding to your rude treatment of her.", "NTA\nYour child and home, your rules.\nAlso, we do something similar with our son. Especially around birthdays or holidays. They get so much stuff, they get overwhelmed and don't know what to play with.\nWe let him open the gifts and the next day, we will put some away and then change it up after a bit or add something.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad strategy for most toys, but I think it\u2019s probably not the best for gifts. \n\nI\u2019m sure people want to see your son enjoy the presents they give him - not to see them go directly into a closet. \n\nYour aunt\u2019s reaction puts her more in the AH camp IMO, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if others don\u2019t really want to buy gifts for the closet. I\u2019d see if you can come up with a way for friends and family to actually give your son gifts directly.", "YTA. I agree with the rotation, but she gave him a present. Most gift givers like to see the recipient enjoy it for a bit. You could have allowed him to play with it while Aunt was there. Then later on put it in the closet to include in the next rotation.", "NTA \nWe do toy rotation too (more like toys that are not used that week get put away and come back later) because my kids have too many toys.   Maybe your aunt should have a ban on new toys unless it's a celebration?  That's we've had to do with my in-laws that always brought things for my kids.", "NTA I think that's a brilliant idea and this way he gets to enjoy all the toys longer because first he's not easily bored by them and second they'll in general last longer. I barely gift my niblings any toys cause I know they'll get plenty from other people. Instead I ask my sister what they really need (clothes, shoes, school stuff) and take my share on that. I think what you are doing is very responsible and kids don't need too many (useless) toys.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with toy rotation, but many parents do. A difference in parenting philosophy doesn\u2019t make you a bad mom.", "NTA, I\u2019m a toddler teacher and have a degree in child development, you\u2019re doing great.", "Asshole? no. But here is what you did wrong. Your aunt probably spend a good amount of money on that truck, thus she wanted to see the joy of the son as he plays with it. My grandma was like that, she would save up money to buy stuff for my cousin just to see the sparkle on her eyes.  \nOn her last years, she would tell us stories how we smiled laughed with joy with the toys or snacks she got for us.   \nFor you, right thng would be just making the rotation early and let your aunt her little memory she would potentially cherish for rest of her (probably) limited years.  \n\n\nYet again, rotation is a good idea and aunt had overreacted.", "ESH. Toy rotations are great, we do them. But if a relative brings a gift we thank them and allow the children to play with it. It can be put away the next day. That\u2019s the polite thing to do. Your aunt was still completely out of line demanding that V have access to it all the time and basically everything else she said.", "NTA. \n\nI have a nearly two year old I do a similar thing with as we are currently living at her grandmothers. She overreacted IMO.", "NTA your aunt is way out of line here I would give your aunt a time out for her behavior. Plus like everyone else to see the toy rotating is a good thing plus like you said you wouldn\u2019t be able to remember every toy that you get him plus the more toys he has the quicker he\u2019ll lose interest in them and then that money spent on the toys will have been wasted. \nAlso if the aunt continues this behavior I would recommend limiting on when and where she can visit your son.", "NTA. Your aunt is being ridiculous. Lots of parents rotate toys. It doesn\u2019t hurt the kids at all. Ignore her.", "NTA. I|T's really sensible - as you say, it means your son doesn't get bored and gets the 'fun' of unfamiliar toys. I assume that o there's something he's really fond off you would let him keep that out if he missed it, and as he gets older he'll have more choice in what's in and what's out, but it sounds like a great way to avoid being overwhelmed. \n\nWhen my younger sister was small, our area had a toy library which worked on a similar basis - you could borrow toys for a week or two so kids got to play with more of a variety of things . It sounds as though you are doing something similar on a personal level!", "NTA. Kids can get overstimulated and toys that are loud and bright can do that to some. aunt needs to respect your boundary. However, if someone gave my kid a gift, I would let them give it to my kid and then when rotation time happens, it can go into rotation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're the parent, you can manage your kids toys however you want. No light-up toys? You're the parent. Only Star Wars toys? You're the parent. As long as you are caring for your sons health and safety, toy management is a non-issue. \n\nSure, you could appease your aunt by letting her see her toy played with when it's given, but nothing about this justifies her response.

We rotated toys for our kids and we still do it for our cats (because our cats are just four legged toddlers). We also had a rule that super noisy toys eventually got \"operated on\" because there is only so many times you can handle Elmo singing \"On the road again\" without losing your mind.

Too many toys, too may choices. Your way, every week is a new experience. I'm sure if your son has a special toy or stuffed animal, you don't take that away. Keep doing what you are doing. It is a great idea.", "ESH - rotating toys is great practice, especially for really small children. You aren\u2019t doing anything wrong by having that policy.\n\nYou did commit a social faux pas by immediately stuffing the truck in the closet. When someone brings a toy as a gift to your house, they expect to see the kid play with it. They want the satisfaction of knowing that child is enjoying something that they spent time and money selecting specifically for that child. Seeing the kid playing with the toy is the equivalent of a kid who can\u2019t say \u201cthank you\u201d yet giving that kind of acknowledgment.\n\nYour aunt handled the rejection - because sticking it in the closet, even if you had a logical reason, looked like a rejection - really badly.\n\nI think you should offer an apology for the way you received the gift. Don\u2019t back down on your rotation policy, just acknowledge that you hurt her feelings and promise to handle things differently in the future. That can look like letting your kid play with the toy for a little while in front of the gift giver and then moving it wherever in the rotation schedule makes sense to you.", "NTA - I always did toy rotation because my family spoiled the bejezzus out of my kid. If anyone complained I would have told them to kick rocks as well. If the only way your aunt can show love is to buy crap then her love is kind of crap.", "NTA. This is smart as hell and seems like it makes him enjoy his toys more and get extra life out of them. Who cares if you wait a couple days or weeks to give him a new toy as long as he gets it eventually?", "NTA. Only reason I can understand her being upset is if she wanted the joy of seeing him play with the toy right away.\n\nOne thing I want to caution though - My mom apparently used to hide toys and then throw them away if I didn't ask for them. I didn't realize and thought I was just misplacing/losing things. I lost a lot of my favorite toys that way and felt really bad about it. This situation is different but I just want to caution how you handle it so your son doesn't get confused/frustrated as he gets older.", "Oh wow! She was way outta line. You are being super reasonable and keeping the chaos of kids toys to a min! You are NTA, but your aunt is a huge one", "NTA. Not at all.\n\nBut, I would say, thay when someone buys a kid a toy/pressie they like to see the childs reaction. It's a bit like a thank you for them. In that regard you may have handled the politeness of the situation better ams let him have the truck and put it away later.\n\nBut it's genuinely a great idea.", "NTA- We rotate toys too. It's super common with parents.", "NTA. This is fantastic idea, toy rotations are extremely common these days. Keeps things fun and fresh for him, he also has NO clue and will not for a couple years, he'll just play with what is immediately visible and be none the wiser.\n\nEspecially agree on the sound/noise making toys, hard limit in our house of only a couple at a time. We found everyone seems to gravitate to those as gifts because they seem cool, oooh lights and sounds! No one considers that the parents want to smash them against the wall after the 473rd repetition of the dang song that's hard-coded into the device, lol.", "You sound like a fantastic parent - both thoughtful and principled. Congratulations and NTA", "Bruuuuuuuuh , most preschools and child development centers do this anyway.  Experts suggest certain changes to classroom and play areas  in order to engage kids on multiple subjects and concepts over time. I'm my classrooms, I often changed out the sensory table on a monthly basis with different toys and materials that reflected the curriculum or any upcoming holidays/seasonal changes.\nMany child psychologists and other child development experts consider toy rotation to be a great way to avoid over stimulation and \"too many toys\" tantrums.  It also reduces wear and tear on toys and helps them last longer. I usually use the time when certain toys are rotated out to deep clean them too!\nAlso, your kid is, like, not even one. So this is the perfect age to do this!\nNTA, but your aunt sure is.\nGreat job, Mama bear!", "Agreed, however the crazy aunt has showed her true colors. The name-calling was bad enough, but I would be going LC or NC with anyone who could so easily call me an abuser.", "Came here to say this. In all the years I did trainings for early childhood education, it was recommended to rotate toys for this reason and as OP reasoned, to keep toys new interesting and fresh. Besides I doubt OP rotates EVERY toy, there's probably at least 2 or 3 things that are staple favorites that are kept out of rotation.", "I can say with certainty that for me it did negatively impact me.", "Montessori educator turned stay at home dad for a while. My toddlers toys are sorted by type on our shelves and we will rotate things in and out, both for variety and to introduce new toys as his development progresses. Having it organized and replacing the toys to their spot every night means that he has a consistent environment and knows where things are.

Toy rotation is so smart but I think with gifts you have to make an exception", "i realize now that was kind of mean, i wasnt really thinking about how it might have been for her seeing the gift she just got him put away without being touched.", "i agree, looking back with a calmer head i was a little bit mean. i probably should have let him play with it. i usually only let him have one or two sound toys out at once because I cant handle more but i shouldn't be basing his gifts on what i prefer, and next time someone gets him a gift, lesson learned, put it away after they leave.", "yeah I've gotta be a bit more flexible with his schedule, im aware as he grows hes not going to be as cooperative and ive learned my lesson. let them play with the gift then decide if i'm going to put it away", "ive told my family, after the Christmas fiasco, to ask what he needs before getting anything, obviously gifts are welcome every once in a while, but sometimes it's too much. my aunt doesn't live very close by so when she does send packages, she says it's because she can't spend time with him so I've let it go more than others. also, hes the first grandson, great grandson, and greatgreat grandson on both sides plus the first baby in the family in 10yrs so you can imagine the kind, and amount, of stuff i got.", "how come you are being downvoted? its weird.", "It sounds like you have a very skewed idea of gift giving, like the aunt. \n\nGiving gifts because of what you get out of it is very strange to me.", "I appreciate your honesty!  i definitely have learned that i should let him play with the toy while they are there then just put it away that night. lesson learned and ingrained in my brain lol.", "this is honestly the first time she's ever done anything like this, i don't see her very often but she loves my son and will send him packages every so often with stuff so i really wouldn't remember her stuff from others.", "oh trust me, I've already had to take batteries out of some of the \"wonderful\" toys. luckily he's so young he doesn't notice, but i know im going to have to get used to the most annoying sounds as he grows. just hoping for a few more months of peace lol", "yes, a few stuffed animals and some of his more sentimental toys he gets all the time!", "People with these kinds of strings attached are so weird to me. I\u2019ve been the mom and the aunt in this scenario. I\u2019m perfectly fine getting a text from my sister 6 weeks after I gave a gift to let me know how much my nieces/nephews are enjoying the toy.\n\nI\u2019m not giving gifts for recognition or for some sort of \u201cBest Aunt\u201d award, I just want a child I love to enjoy something, whether it\u2019s today or next month. \n\nYou\u2019re fine.", "Sharing happiness and joy is not \"what you get out of it\" we put thought in our gifts. What would make the people on the recieving end happy? Why, wanting to see the exciment of it makes it \"get somethng out of it\" gifts are not soulless material aids you give the people in need. I am not saying aunt was right about how she reacted and acted but giving a gift to someone, specially to a baby and it ending up in a closet is not a good feeling.", "Exactly! If you included those in the rotation, even though they held the most comfort value, then I'd say there's a bit of a issue. But you don't!

Their school does too. And the kids section of the library. Your aunt is not only the A, but crazy too. Its actually pretty standard...", "Is knowing/hearing that someone is happy not enough? Do you need to see it? What if they don\u2019t like it, and they have to pretend for your sake? Was it worth it? \n\nGifts are given to enrich someone\u2019s life, for their enjoyment. If you can\u2019t be satisfied giving a gift without the affirmation of the recipient\u2019s visible happiness and joy, then yes, I think that perspective is skewed.", "Great point - daycare, preschool, kindergarten and grade 1 classes, all have rotated toys.", "Where the hell did i say they need to \"pretend\"? Stop putting words in my mouth for starters.   \n\n\nSecondly, do you know what is most direct method to enrich someones life and enjoyment? Give them money. It is the fastest method.   \nIts not about being \"satisfied\" its about being happy. There have been times people give gifts even without seeing the person. I did at least.  \n\n\nNow, the point is, can you argue its NOT better to not see their happiness and joy? Of course that god damn aunt would love to see her grand nephew happy because of her, that would make her happy and probably be a moment that would make her week and maybe even rest of her life. I am not saying OP is the ASShole for having a rotation or somethng, and i am not defending aunt for how did she react as you realize.  \n\n\nWhat i am saying is, giving the kid the god damn toy and sharing the moment of joy and exciment would be the better option for everyone here.   \n\"but sometimes my excitement gets the better of me .\"  op had the same feeling, op made the exception of skipping her own rules to see the moment earlier. Let the damn kid have the toy for the day, and put it on the closet the next day and let the aunt share the moment. Is this too hard of a concept to grasp?", "Inform the Aunt that from that day and for the future. She will NOT see your son, ge will NOT go to her house and unless she gives s full apology she is NC. Period! \nNTA - I did the same things and my kids are all adults now.", "ESH", "ESH - The rotation is a good idea, but when someone gives your baby a toy, you can expect them to want to watch him play with it. You should've 1. Swapped another toy out of the rotation and let him have the fire truck or 2. Let him play with the fire truck until she left, then put it into the rotation. Her reaction was over the top but your rigidity about this is a bit weird.", "HAHAHAHAHA NTA at all!!\n\nReject any gifts from her until she apologises because you\u2019re the parent - not her. \n\nWe still rotate toys - albeit some faves stay - and my kiddos are 4 and 2.", "NTA. That's actually a very good idea. It's not like you said, \"Thanks!,\" then threw it out.", "NTA. This is actually standard practice in early childhood centers too. We would rotate toys every 4 weeks to keep children stimulated and engaged with learning. They get bored of toys rather quickly and start to not use them for educational purposes or not want to interact them all together. You switch them out for a toy that teaches them same thing (fine motor, spatial awareness, etc) this way they keep wanting to use it for its educational purpose. \n\nKeep doing what you are doing!", "[removed]", "Absolutely NTA, even working in Childcare I didn't think to rotate my daughter's toys when she was a baby. It's great for them to have a change up. You're a fantastic and creative mum!", "NTA but your aunt is. This was a common practice at our house esp at birthday or Christmas. The kids would get too many gifts and be overwhelmed so we would take half up and switch them out in a few months. Worked great. They stayed interested", "NTA but i would like to add if someone brings your child a gift they should, at the very least,  be able to watch your child's happiness in opening and using the gift you could then later put it into the rotation.", "NTA. You have a 1 year old. You are doing what works for all of you and your aunt is being ridiculous. She needs a time out.", "the rotation is definitely genius, but i understand someone being kind of upset that someone is stashing the gift they went out of their way to buy your child. her reaction though, is absolutely ridiculous, and i wouldn't allow her around your kid until she apologized because wtf?? nta just because of her reaction (and that you are the parent, but hopefully it's understandable why someone would be a little offended)", "NTA.  Your aunt is nutty.", "NTA, and the aunt is showing some concerning red flags. That being said, no need to be this rigid with the rotation. Toys they get from someone he should have access now, so in the moment that person can see it's being appreciated. Not as a need, but more as a courtesy. I'm sure you could have switched another noisy toy out of rotation after she had left.\n\nYou're doing some excellent parenting though! Keep it up :)", "NTA my mil got really upset with me about this too when we were on vacation she literally ransacked our house looking for a small train she gave my daughter years ago. She couldn\u2019t even enjoy the time with the kid, she was obsessed. I told her beforehand we toy rotate. People need to let parents choose their own rhythm", "My son played with a stack of foam bowls for hours.  I rotated toys.  Toys that were popular always stayed out. It's pretty bold of her to think you'd actually bring your kid over to her house.  Now, I always let my son play with the toys people gave him.  They wanna see it.  But, still nta.  She went way over the top.", "I\u2019m going against the grain with a soft YTA but so is your aunt. She brought him a gift and it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you to let him play with it while dear Aunty was there. Then put it away until the next rotation. Sometimes being flexible is key to maintaining family harmony. But your Aunt is a real pain the in the diapers and I wouldn\u2019t invite her over again for a while to spare your sanity", "My sister-in-law did this and also she put away some of the  Christmas and birthday girts/toys for later. Then when they were getting bored with old toys, or one broke, she could add to the rotation.", "NTA honey!! But you aunt is a different story!  Your baby ...your rules! \n\nI love this idea of yours!! Your baby will never be bored!", "ESH?\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH and I agree with the rotation plan.  But, I think you can make exceptions when people bring him new toys.  Even if he just plays with it for a bit while they\u2019re with him and you put it away after he goes to bed and bring it back on the rotation schedule.   She for sure over reacted, but it does feel rude to be like oh thanks, let me shove this in the closet.", "NTA \n\nand this was such an excellent idea..\n\nYour aunt is scary! Set some boundaries with her. Maybe tell her to postpone visits for a bit. Calling you an abuser is wayyy over the line AND not at all justified. She needs to know her lane and stay in it.", "We did this every three to four months for several years. Keeps the clutter down and provides new toys regularly NTA", "N T A for rotating at that age (though obviously if he shows a preference for a specific toy it should get an exemption). But maybe ESH for putting it away right in front of her after she'd given it to him. She vastly overreacted so she's an A, but that was a bit rude.", "A 1 year old watching Star Wars already? Let alone the aunt, to me OP IS TA for allowing that. Im so glad my kids actually played at that age. TV came only after they were about 5. Rotating is great, taking the time to play with them is even better.", "NTA for the rotation plan. So long as your not taking away whatever his favorite is until it's clear that it is overshadowed by something else.\n\n However, I definitely think you should have atleast let him play with it for that day, even if it was only to act polite to her.\n\nThat said, while I probably would have also interpreted your initial response to the gift to be slightly rude, her response was absolutely wrong on multiple levels.", "NTA, but if you keep doing this once he's old enough to understand make sure you explain to him what you're doing, when he'll get it back, and give him some agency in it. My parents did ig the evil version of this where they'd just randomly decide to box up most of our toys and stick them in the shed and then randomly bequeath them back because we'd \"just forget about them and then it'd be like Christmas all over again!\" And it was extremely extremely stressful to all of us.", "NTA \n\nMoms everywhere do this (especially for toddlers) to keep them engaged. Stay strong! You are a great mom! Your aunt sounds out to lunch though\u2026 going off the handle for something that many moms do.", "NTA, kids toys get out of hand FAST. But I do think you could adjust the rotation as needed - like letting your son have the toy that was JUST gifted to him. I think immediately putting it away in front of aunt was a touch rude - but she entirely overreacted.\n\nBut like hey, if she wants the toys she buys to live at her house, that\u2019s an ideal situation imo lol.", "NTA and rotating toys is a wonderful idea! You can be softer about it though\u2026 If somebody gives him a new toy it\u2019s totally OK to introduce said toy and then phase it out\u2026 all toys don\u2019t have to be rotated on a specific schedule. The idea of rotating toys (which is a concept used by child development specialist) is simply to keep stimulation high and interactions new and exciting. You can be flexible about it.\n\nYour aunt, on the other hand, sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA and don\u2019t invite that aunt over again. She\u2019s the one who demonstrated abusive behavior with her meltdown and name calling! Your house and your child = your rules. He won\u2019t \u201calways\u201d have access to her crap because she won\u2019t have access to him if she doesn\u2019t respect your rules (which, by the way, is a perfectly rational rule for a toddler!)", "If a child has so many toys that you're rotating them... then you certainly aren't *depriving* him of anything. It's a great idea and the kid get a lot more fun from these new toys.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nI used to work in Head Start and we do this same thing in our toddler and preschool rooms. Once a week we would go to the shed or swap with other classrooms. The kids loved coming in on Monday to see what was new.", "NTA toy rotation is a great idea! Your aunt sounds like the lady at the grocery store yelling at every mom for raising their kids wrong because it was different back in her day", "NTA. \n\nMy mother was doing a toy rotation back in the 80s. \n\nYour aunt would think I was the worst. I used to keep toys in the box for months and slowly introduce birthday/Christmas gifts as my kids got so many at once.", "I think you're a pretty smart mom.  The rotation schedule should change as they grow (we did a solid five years of Thomas) but at your babies age, your plans are perfection.    \n\n\nas an auntie as well...I would NEVER insist a mommy take my offerings of toys.   Mommy's and daddys know what kids are ready for.   Aunties smile on the sidelines and try to do their best.", "NTA. Rotating kids\u2019 toys is great! My boss keeps presents the kids get in a closet for me to pull out when rotating toys or rainy days or grumpy days. \n\nYour aunt overreacted. She *could* have said \u201ccan you let him play with it while I\u2019m here so I can see his joy? Then put it away?\u201d instead of flying off the handle. \n\nWhen you do pull out the fire engine take a video for your aunt and send it to her.", "NTA, tell her that id she tried to steal any of your kids toys, that you will call the police. They are no longer hers.", "NTA.  After all that name calling, you should never ever let her see your son again.  She called you an abuser over a TOY?!  Anyone who accuses you of child abuse should be blocked from your life permanently.", "ESH.  Your rotation plan is fine, but don't put it into storage in front of the giver.  That's quite rude.  Let him play with it while she's there, *then* put it into the rotation closet.\n\nShe also does not get to make demands on gifts she gives, or to adjust your rotation to suit her.  It sounds like she was saying that out of umbrage.", "NTA I thought this was normal practice? My nephew gets bored of his toys and starts yelling for attention all the time, rotating toys keeps him interested in playing by himself so his mama can take care of his sister", "Wow  Your aunt is kinda wild!  Toy rotation is good--I always put away half the xmas toys to bring out when the first tier got wrecked!  But I don't blame your aunt for wanting to see his reaction to her thoughtfulness, so I think you might consider that you  could have been a little less rigid about the situation and waited until she left before stashing the truck away.", "The toy rotation is a common recommended strategy and your aunt is an idiot for freaking out and calling it abusive.\n\nThat being said, it would not have been hard to accept the truck and give it to him in the spot so the aunt could experience the joy of seeing him discover it. It was rather rude not to. You could have subtracted some other item from the current rotation after she left.", "NTA but:\nI'm a kindergarten teacher.\nRotating toys sounds great to me. Personally I wouldn't stick to three weeks (if I remember correctly) but would want to respond to some individual schedule given by your son.\nBut all in all, rotating is a great solution.\n\nAnd you are absolutely not in the clear wrong, but I do get how your aunt would want to see your son reacting to her gift. I'm not a mother myself, but I think I'd present gifts to my child when the giver is around - given that it's appropriate the child's age)\n\nBut to he honest: I really don't see the point of some sound making star wars toys at that age (or at all, bit that's another discussion)", "NTA. I actually love this. Definitely telling my nieces and nephew's parents. This is simply brilliant!", "NTA. Rotating toys is an amazing idea, they forget about it and think it is a new toy when you put it back in place, it also helps them develops different interests. Lets be fair\u2026 boomers didn\u2019t know how to raise kids", "Yes, toy rotation is a pretty well known concept among my parent circles and is considered good for child development. \n\nBut regardless of any parenting strategies, the moment she took the toy and proclaimed it would always be available to your child in your room, she needed to be shown the door. That is entirely unacceptable presumption.", "I thought everybody did this. Who can deal with all the kids' toys being out at the same time?", "I agree. When I was a kid I had trouble finding something to watch on tv when there were only three channels, now I scroll endlessly over the myriad choices and can't find anything to watch.", "I'm in my early 30's and get excited when I find something buried in my closet I haven't seen in a while \ud83d\ude02  My mom would rotate our toys when we were younger and I never realized it until she said something years later.  Our favorites didn't get rotated, but others did.", "This is what my dad would do if my sister gave him the chance with her son. She says he'll never be alone with our dad. Ever. Hell, he does it with my dogs. Feeds them things that he knows make them sick. Says, well there was nothing wrong while they were here. Yeah that's because you dropped them off in time to throw up all over my house & not eat right for the next 2 days.", "Agreed, if someone brings something for your son it's rude to put it away without letting them see him play with it. Then you get all the joy of showing him something exciting and the gift giver does not, which is half the fun of giving a gift.", "i did reach out to her a day after the fact an apologized, at the time i dint think i was wrong but now i can see i was kind of a butthole too ngl. but i told her she was way out of line and i needed to have some space from her for a bit as what she said was really hurtful. she has yet to respond", "I would normally agree. However, I feel she lost that graciousness when the aunt decided to explode on OP. Especially after explaining the toy rotation which is fairly reasonable and smart on OP's part to keep her child engaged. If anyone did that to me in my own home, I would've given them the gift back and told them to leave immediately. Would it have been nice to let her son play with the toy the aunt brought? Sure! Should OP be called an AH for deciding that her child would play with it later? I don't believe so. So I'm in the NTA boat.

She needs to apologize and get on the same page.", "Nah OP - you're not the asshole.  Your aunt was inappropriate and screaming and name calling should mean that she doesn't;t get to see your kid anywhere - your house, her house or anyone else's house.
