NTA. Anyways in a few years they will be able to make up their own minds about visiting you. Just keep a line open.", "NAH.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let my kids go to someone\u2019s house that I had never been to and didn\u2019t know where it was. I think it\u2019s fair to say you can\u2019t take the kids to your place. \n\nBut - if she won\u2019t let you visit at her place without your address then she is being manipulative.", "There are NAH. Your sister is not an AH for wanting to see the place where her children are staying for several hours or overnight. You could be a Howard Hughes type recluse, peeing in bottles, or a hoarder who has to wander through paths of mail to get around your apartment. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re any of those things, but those types are certainly out there.\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for not wanting your family to know where you live, but you probably have to make a choice between withholding this information from your sister or watching her kids.", "It should be possible to have your family know where you live without having them come visit all the time. But obviously, you know these people, and if you feel it is necessary to keep your adress secret to uphold boundaries with them, then so be it. NTA. On the other hand, I don't have children, but if I did, I don't think I'd let them visit someone whose adress was unknown to me. So, there is a balance to be struck here, and you are the one in charge of doing it.", "NTA..... You've just chosen to have specific boundaries for self preservation.  Everyone needs to have their own space for sanity. You're doing something good for yourself, keep it up!", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed your privacy. Call your sister's bluff, then. I bet she cherishes the free time when you take her kids to yours so she'll probably fold.\n\nEdit to add:  If she had no issue before, letting her kids stay with you while she doesn't know your address, why does she want to know now?! I bet it's the parents talking through her.", "NTA you\u2019ve set boundaries with your wider family to keep yourself safe and healthy. Clearly your sister doesn\u2019t need the same boundaries but that doesn\u2019t make you wrong and her right, or vice versa. It\u2019s a shame she\u2019s punishing herself and your nieces because she doesn\u2019t understand that.", "NTA. \nYour boundaries are your boundaries. No one has the right to dictate what your boundaries should be or how you should live your life", "You're definitely NTA, it sounds like you have good reason to keep your family at arms length and protect your peace for fear of them overstepping your boundaries. Your sister is an AH for using your neices as a way of getting you to do what she wanted.\n\nIt would be one thing if your sister's concern was that she wanted to know where her kids were staying in case something happened but it sounds like she's just being nosey.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA and think boundaries need to be set.\n\nHowever I will say that family relationships, just like any relationships, require both sides to engage to make them successful.  Anecdotally I have seen families become distant because one side believes it is entirely on the other side to maintain communication.", "NTA.

And Sis sure seemed willing to deal with that.\n\nBut now that she can use this knowledge as a weapon against the OP, she was to know where she lives. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find that that good old Mom had discovered that Sis is in contact with OP and is pressuring Sis to find out where OP lives.\n\nBecause why else would Sis suddenly care about the whereabouts of the children when she hasn\u2019t cared before?\n\nAs someone who is also one of seven kids, the power plays within large families can be brutal.\n\nLooks like OP loses her nieces and Sis loses her free childcare and her relationship with her sister, if OP needs to maintain her boundaries, and I\u2019ll bet she really needs to.", "NTA and I wouldn't be surprised to find some sort of tracking device (phone with location sharing on) the next time she allows your nieces to visit.", "NTA!\n\n~~Your sister is AH manipulative since she threatened you by banning you from seeing her children if you refuse to give your address, which is absolutely insane and ridiculous.~~\n\nEDIT: I just re-read it and realized you never told anyone in your family where you live but took your nieces to your home from your parents' place... eh... I'd say NAH. Just don't take them to your place if you don't want them to know where you live.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain. YTA. You should at least tell your sister where you live, considering her children spend the night. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to tell the rest of your family.

She doesn't care about the kids, she cares about the fact that _she_ doesn't know. The kids are a bargaining tool, nothing else.", "NTA.  It's bizarre that your sister didn't know where her kids were going for six years.  Good old mom and dad have probably been asking her where you are taking the kids.\n\nYou're allowed your boundaries.  It's kind of cruel that she won't allow you any access to the children now.  Just let the kids know that you love them and you'll miss them.  Tell them you'll explain it all to them when they're older.", "NTA and it's ok to call her bluff.  Just tell her you still want to see your nieces but will take them on day trips and not overnight.  Chances are she's going to miss her occasional free babysitter.  I agree with what others said.  If she allows them to spend the night look for a tracker in their stuff like an Airtag.", "you\u2019re NTA for keeping your address confidential from your family. \n\nyour sister is NTA for wanting to know where her kids are but she is TA for threatening to cut you off from the kids entirely.\n\nif i were you i\u2019d just stay under the radar and let this blow over. your sister will eventually figure out she misses the free childcare.", "NTA. I understand that sometimes people need or want to keep their address private for various reasons. That is your right.  Maybe you could offer to show your sister a video of the inside of your home so she can see it is a safe place. When you take the video, make sure you don't show what is outside the windows--close the curtains. Or, you could not take the children to your home, only to public places.  If she says \"no,\" just let her know you are sorry you won't be able to provide free childcare any more.", "YTA for one simple reason:\n\nYou have their kids over without them knowing the address.", "YTA\n\nIt's not strange to want to be sure where your children are spending the night is suitable/safe.", "This.  NAH.", "Except it doesn\u2019t really matter what sister\u2019s reasons are. Those are her children, and she has the right to know where they are and know that the environment is safe and healthy for them.", "><< *from your parents' place*\\>>  \nSlight clarification.  OP doesn't pick them up from OP's parents but picks the niblings up from THEIR parents home(sister & BIL)", "I mean, you're not wrong, but ... the more that OP might benefit from therapy, the more valid reasons that she would also have for not telling the family where she lives. \n\nI can't read between the lines, I can't tell if there is unpleasantness  in the family history that causes OP to distance herself, or if OP is e.g. not neurotypical, LGBTQ, asexual etc. Or they could be just the only introvert in the family. We don't know. What is there to \"reconcile\" for instance? All we know is that she is prone to depression. So yes, she might benefit from therapy.\n\nBut it doesn't matter to the main question: If OP doesn't want to tell them the address, she does not have to. But it's a consequential decision - If the childrens' mother is no longer comfortable sending her children to an unknown address, she also doesn't have to, either.", "Read the first sentence.  Boundaries.  Sometimes the boundaries are NC", "Ohhh! Thank you for the clarification!", "Or\u2026the sister came to the realization that she had never seen the place where her children were spending an occasional overnight, and she grew a little concerned. Sister might not be that quick on the uptake, or she\u2019s simply overwhelmed by the day-to-day of taking care of 2 adolescents. I\u2019m not trying to invalidate OP\u2019s feelings about her upbringing or its trauma, but I suspect her family is more misguided than malignant. Being the odd duck always carries with it a little extra attention.", "IDK. I can see why the older sister doesn't care to know exactly where the kids are address-wise...because it's her sister. I get OP is saying they don't have a close relationship but visiting them every second weekend implies that OP gets along with her sister just fine and that she has been in these girl's lives for a while. The girls are 10 and 12, which means they're old enough to report back to Mom if there is any weirdness like dirty house or not eating. IDK, OP isn't a stranger and this doesn't seem totally bizarre from the standpoint they do have a functioning relationship. Frankly, I find it bizarre that she doesn't know where her sister lives after all these years, period. Also if she wants to know, the 12 year old could 100% figure it out and report back without telling OP if her mom asked...\n\nI don't have a judgement, but OP, do you see yourself as being able to reconcile with your family? I get that past hurt doesn't go away easily and you have your peace, but it sounds like your sister will use your nieces as a bargaining chip here. \n\nTo me, the wildest part is that your sister doesn't even wanna know because her kids are there; she wants to know so you can reconcile with your fam and admit you're not close because you're an AH? \ud83d\udc80", "\\- You moved out SIX YEARS ago\n\n\\- Every four or five weeks you have your nieces for a sleepover\n\n\\- It took these SIX YEARS for just one family member (the mother of said nieces) to wonder what your address is ?!?\n\n\\- So obviously none of your family members helped you move\n\nNTA, and there's no reason for you to enlighten your family members of your whereabouts.", "YTA \n\nYou have her kids! Of course she wants to know where her children are staying! Like come on!", "Sounds like she made the decision for you. Stop all contact, you don\u2019t have to give more info or of yourself than you are comfortable with. That\u2019s your sister\u2019s problem, not yours. \n\nYou probably have a good reason for not telling them where you live and it\u2019s good that your protective of yourself.\n\nTbh they sound a bit toxic. If a sibling threatened me like that, I\u2019d be happy to lose her #. I\u2019m my moms lest favorite child but we still have a relationship without my siblings getting involved.", "The kids have been going to the unknown house for the past 6 years. I agree parents should know where their kids are, but suddenly changing the requirement after 6 years does prompt a request for why.", "Assuming facts not in evidence.\n\nOP moved out of her family\u2019s house 6 years ago.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t state how long she has been taking her nieces for overnight stays. People are jumping to that conclusion."]}
