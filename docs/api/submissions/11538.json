Did I read that wrong, or is that really what happened?", "It's a bit sad that you won't be able to see your cousins anymore =( \nIf you are having them over at your home, then it's understandable she would want to know where that is, but that also doesn't mean you have to tell her. \n\nJust a shame really... NTA. Anyways in a few years they will be able to make up their own minds about visiting you. Just keep a line open.", "NAH.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let my kids go to someone\u2019s house that I had never been to and didn\u2019t know where it was. I think it\u2019s fair to say you can\u2019t take the kids to your place. \n\nBut - if she won\u2019t let you visit at her place without your address then she is being manipulative.", "There are NAH. Your sister is not an AH for wanting to see the place where her children are staying for several hours. You could be a Howard Hughes type recluse, peeing in bottles, or a hoarder who has to wander through paths of mail to get around your apartment. I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re any of those things, but those types are certainly out there.\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for not wanting your family to know where you live, but you probably have to make a choice between withholding this information from your sister and watching her kids.", "It should be possible to have your family know where you live without having them come visit all the time. But obviously, you know these people, and if you feel it is necessary to keep your adress secret to uphold boundaries with them, then so be it. NTA. On the other hand, I don't have children, but if I did, I don't think I'd let them visit someone whose adress was unknown to me. So, there is a balance to be struck here, and you are the one in charge of doing it.", "NTA..... You've just chosen to have specific boundaries for self preservation.  Everyone needs to have their own space for sanity. You're doing something good for yourself, keep it up!", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed your privacy. Call your sister's bluff, then. I bet she cherishes the free time when you take her kids to yours so she'll probably fold.\n\nEdit to add:  If she had no issue before, letting her kids stay with you while she doesn't know your address, why does she want to know now?! I bet it's the parents talking through her.", "NTA you\u2019ve set boundaries with your wider family to keep yourself safe and healthy. Clearly your sister doesn\u2019t need the same boundaries but that doesn\u2019t make you wrong and her right, or vice versa. It\u2019s a shame she\u2019s punishing herself and your nieces because she doesn\u2019t understand that.", "NTA. \nYour boundaries are your boundaries. No one has the right to dictate what your boundaries should be or how you should live your life", "You're definitely NTA, it sounds like you have good reason to keep your family at arms length and protect your peace for fear of them overstepping your boundaries. Your sister is an AH for using your neices as a way of getting you to do what she wanted.\n\nIt would be one thing if your sister's concern was that she wanted to know where her kids were staying in case something happened but it sounds like she's just being nosey.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA and think boundaries need to be set.\n\nHowever I will say that family relationships, just like any relationships, require both sides to engage to make them successful.  Anecdotally I have seen families become distant because one side believes it is entirely on the other side to maintain communication.", "NTA. Your life your choice.", "NTA: You're ore than likely won't be seeing your nieces until they're old enough to take themselves places or if you go to family events.", "NTA\n\nSis was clearly okay with the kids being at OP\u2019s house without knowing where it is.\n\nThe free childcare for a weekend came at that cost. And Sis sure seemed willing to deal with that.\n\nBut now that she can use this knowledge as a weapon against the OP, she was to know where she lives. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find that that good old Mom had discovered that Sis is in contact with OP and is pressuring Sis to find out where OP lives.\n\nBecause why else would Sis suddenly care about the whereabouts of the children when she hasn\u2019t cared before?\n\nAs someone who is also one of seven kids, the power plays within large families can be brutal.\n\nLooks like OP loses her nieces and Sis loses her free childcare and her relationship with her sister, if OP needs to maintain her boundaries, and I\u2019ll bet she really needs to.", "NTA and I wouldn't be surprised to find some sort of tracking device (phone with location sharing on) the next time she allows your nieces to visit.", "NTA!\n\n~~Your sister is AH manipulative since she threatened you by banning you from seeing her children if you refuse to give your address, which is absolutely insane and ridiculous.~~\n\nEDIT: I just re-read it and realized you never told anyone in your family where you live but took your nieces to your home from your parents' place... eh... I'd say NAH. Just don't take them to your place if you don't want them to know where you live.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain. YTA. You should at least tell your sister where you live, considering her children spend the night. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to tell the rest of your family. Your sister deserves to know where her kids are staying. If you firmly do not wish to tell them, fine, but no more sleepovers at your place then.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
