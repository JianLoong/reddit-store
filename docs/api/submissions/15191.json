The company, of course, did not have this policy. I also took your advice to get out of that job quickly and am happy to say I\u2019m starting a new job in 3 weeks! \n\nI know the person who will be my supervisor in my new job and she is a very kind, normal person. \n\nPretty nervous to give my notice to the toxic boss on Monday, but oh well, if she\u2019s nasty then my 2 weeks notice will just become an immediate resignation. We live in a one-party consent for recording state and plan to record the phone conversation to protect myself. \n\nThanks to all of you for giving me the push to move on!", "created_utc": 1681925863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s40ht/update_aita_for_not_giving_my_boss_my_first_class/", "score": 5477, "replies": ["Hey OP, I am glad to see this update! \n\nI was surprised by the entitlement your boss had. \n\nYour boss( soon to be ex) was unprofessional, make sure remember that when they want to \u201ctalk\u201d to you. \n\nYou handled the airport interaction perfectly. There is nothing they can say but to downplay that situation.", "Good for you OP!  There is one thing I suggest, though.  Do not put your 2 weeks in to the toxic boss.  Go to their immediate supervisor, if possible.  If they ask why, mention your new job and toxic boss.", "Congrats on the new gig! And when you meet with her, if she asks why you're leaving, just tell her it's a general \"lack of respect for protocol\" around the office (e.g., like treating employees with a modicum of respect).", "Please update us on her response to your resignation, I love when toxic bosses get all shocked Pikachu when people start to flee the company. Congratulations!", "I don't know if I'd bother giving 2 weeks notice because she may say your last day is today. And then you won't have a job until the new one starts. Pending your savings and how bad you need the money and when your first paycheck arrives for the new job. \n\nCould you use your vacation and sick time, then just give a 3-5 day notice?", "2 weeks? Do jobs/corporations give employees 2 weeks notice before they lay thousands off? Workers give employers a lot more consideration than employers do workers.", "Congrats OP!", "Yea OP! Wishing you the best in your new job! Forget them- it\u2019s their loss- not yours", "Oh hey I remember this! Super happy you\u2019re getting out of that toxic environment and kudos to you for taking action\n\nAlso don\u2019t turn in a two-week notice. Work then leave. Don\u2019t tell her a damn thing.*\n\n*If you\u2019re an American", "I used to handle travel for several executives. One time, an EVP and a subordinate were flying from the East coast (USA) to the West coast (long flight). There was a mechanical problem with the airplane, so the airline changed to a smaller airplane, as that was all that was available. Both executives were originally booked in first class on the flight. After the change, the EVP was no longer in first class, but the subordinate remained. As the subordinate was EVP's pet flying monkey, he couldn't say anything to him and risk losing his most loyal follower, so I was yelled at for 45 minutes, taken to HR to be written up (HR woman was clearly unsure how to handle the situation) and subjected to weeks of petty, punitive behavior from both EVP & his pet. A few years later, when the company decided to institute profit sharing, I was specifically left out (by that time EVP was promoted to president & pet to EVP). As they were gloating about it, I announced I was moving abroad to paradise. Fuck you Dan, you fucking phoney! And fuck you Mark, you flying monkey!", "Boy that boss is gonna feel all kinds of stupid for losing an employee over throwing a fit over an airplane seat. \n\nFAFO", "Agree! Two weeks are courtesy", "Or hand the two weeks notice in to the HR dept.", "I second this.", "Don\u2019t do that, she might try to retaliate (for example trying to figure out which company OP is going to and contacting them badmouthing OP). Best to just say \u201cI am looking for a new opportunity\u201d and leave it at that.", "And then they either need to pay her for the 2 weeks or pay unemployment who will pay her for the 2 weeks. Firing someone who drops notice isn't a particularly good plan.", "It depends, in my country you have to give 2 weeks notice to quit a job as an employee. As an employers its at least 1 month after probation period, unless the employee did something really bad.  Even if you gave a notice for 2 weeks and the boss tells you, that you don't have to work, you are still entitled to your pay.", "In the USA, if you put in your two weeks notice and they fire you on the spot, then you are entitled to unemployment for those two weeks, because they fired you on their terms without actual cause.  My old job tried to do that to me, then expected me to (after I was gone) to work with them to get the new guy up to speed at the old rate.  I was like, that isn't how any of this is going to work.  Either you keep me on, and I train people, or you fire me I collect unemployment, and we can see what my contract labor rate is in the future.", "Please update how the resignation goes!", "I\u2019m surprised you made so many decisions from just an upgrade of a flight seat..", "That\u2019s great news, OP, congratulations!", "Ah, this is a satisfying update. Good for you and good luck!", "The boss sounds like the type who would get upset if emails aren't sent with the To: addresses in hierarchical order.", "Also DO NOT tell anyone where you are going nor update your profile for at least 90 days. I has a colleague who didn\u2019t protect that info and he ended up losing his new job bc a vindictive supervisor used to work there and told them how awful colleague was. It\u2019s sad bc colleague was such an awesome person, the supervisor was a total ahole from the start.", "I wish you the best in this new job! \nBut why not put an immediate resignation and rest this days", "Something I will add 2 things  that might have been addressed in the original post: \n\n* OP probably accumulated some or a lot of those miles for personal travel and purchases having nothing to do with work. Was toxic boss going to refund her a portion of that first class seat? \n\n* Most people view the use of those miles as a benefit of employment, which makes them part of their compensation for employment. If Toxic Boss needed money for some sort of work related emergency out of town and OP had been recently given a bonus, would she expect OP to fork over some dough because she recommended OP for the bonus???\n\nIt really sucks that OP has to just walk out without letting Toxic Boss know that it was her entire lack of protocol about the flight that caused this (OP's new boss knows her old one. Plus, references down the road).", "I want an update of this update after you give your notice.", "Only read a little of the OP, but some people are shining examples of why people leave managers, and not jobs. If she was smart enough, she would have been getting her own upgrades and informing subordinates about the perks. \n\nCongrats on the job and hope it works out well!", "Congrats on the new job!!", "Boy that boss is gonna feel all kinds of stupid for losing an employee over throwing a fit over an airplane seat.\n\nFAFO", "[removed]", "Yeah, since you already have something new lined up and want to leave these crazies in your rear-view mirror, just work the 2 weeks doing the absolute minimum. Then, go to toxic boss at the end of the final day and say \"Today is my last day\" and walk out the door.\n\nAssuming you're in the US, \"at will\" employment cuts both ways.", "Unfortunately I work in a small field so I need to preserve my reputation", "In the US they do. Under the WARN act they are required to give 60 days warning for mass layoffs. That may take the form of \u201cyou no longer have a job, here\u2019s 60 days pay as severance.\u201d", "This situation was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. My boss had been unreasonable before and this just helped me realize it.", "I want to congratulate you on apparently only ever having good bosses. This boss isn't going to feel stupid. They'll think that OP is an entitled brat who left a good job (they'll think it is a good job, with this environment it isnt) because they couldn't follow a rule and complain about entitled workers these days to everyone who will listen. So mainly their captive employees.", "You can legally quit however you want, but if your goal is to maintain a reference (the general reason behind a notice) there is no company that is going to view the above any differently than just giving a 3-5 day notice outright as the point is having the work being done while they get the ball rolling on finding a replacement (in theory)\n\nIf you have no intention of maintaining a reference and want a bit of petty revenge you could just stop showing up until they get the idea,  or call out sick as long as possible before being fired to delay them finding a replacement for your slowly increasing backlog of work.", "I'd agree to give it to HR. I'll also add, look up local labor laws. In many places, if you give two weeks notice and they immediately fire you, you may be eligible for unemployment as it's considered lost wages that you could reasonably expect. Even if it doesn't pay as much as a full paycheck would, money is money and it's still worth seeing if you'd get something", "The company has an HR department.  Unlikely that this boss would be  even be allowed to give a reference.", "[removed]", "She knows my new boss so I definitely can\u2019t be snarky on my way out! Just trying to do the bare minimum and make my exit gracefully.", "Ehh, not a great plan for OP to depend on Unemployment either. Requires a waiting week in most states and then doesn\u2019t pay your full wages.", "(In the US) companies are under no obligation to accept your two week resignation or to pay those 2 weeks if they decide to terminate immediately. \n\nIt is very common to not allow people with privileged access remain on board after notification of intent to leave and MANY companies do not compensate for that policy with pay.\n\nAnd for many, unemployment benefits are significantly less than their income.  I live in FL and 4 weeks of max unemployment ($275/week)  isn't even half of my take-home of a normal 2 week paycheck.", "How about giving notice to the HR and leaving the boss to figure it out?", "I mean, boss has free will and could contact the new employer out of spite on her own. She might get fired for it but at that point it\u2019s too late for OP", "Spam comment copied from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s40ht/update_aita_for_not_giving_my_boss_my_first_class/jgx2506/)", "Don't be snarky, it just makes you look bad. You seem to know that.\n\nPro tip for the people reading comments: this question is not about being honest, it's more likely for them to clock YOU as a problem. Don't use it as an opportunity to vent, they don't care about how crappy your ex employer was.", "Good idea!   We\u2019re all here for the drama so of course you\u2019re going to get a lot of suggestions for a dramatic exit from this sub, but really the safest strategy is to keep your head down and get out with minimal drama.", "At which point OP could sue both the former boss and employer. lol.", "But then OP is out of a job and has to spend money on a lawsuit that they might not win. Isn\u2019t it better to avoid the whole thing in the first place?", "This is great, but now I want a further update!  \n\n\nNTA", "Keep us updated on her reaction.", "Don't give notice she doesn't deserve it.", "I feel like most of us would love to hear her have a melt-down when you tender your resignation.", ">  give my notice to the toxic boss on Monday\n\nOooh, update us!  Hopefully it's nothing, and hopefully they know damn well why you're leaving.", "Give your notice via email as well as by a letter, in person.  She\u2019s toxic enough to deny you gave notice, etc.", "Let me add as a senior level manager, I think it\u2019s great when one of my reports gets to experience things/upgrades; tickets to a game, extra time off, higher % wage lifts, front seat of the plane. All good", "Don't be nervous\nHold your head h own it. Make sure hr knows why, so she cannot do it to your replacement", "Wow, I\u2019m only just reading this, but what audacity!! Even if it wasn\u2019t due to your own personal standing, the airline upgraded your seat. Thems tha breaks. She didn\u2019t pay for her ticket, either, so she basically was saying, \u201cI make more money than you, so I deserve the better seat, even if the airline gave it you.\u201d  I hope HR of your old company knows of her behavior, though you may be escaping, someone else will still have to take her bullshite if the company doesn\u2019t get rid of her.", "Good for you!  You were TOTALLY NTA.  Your soon to be former boss is a total AH.  The nerve!  Congrats on your new job! I wish you the best and so happy you are getting away from the toxic boss.   Employees quit managers NOT jobs most if the time!", "NTA", "Yay and good luck!", "First reaction on notice will be sugar sweet how they love you, then lay the guilt, then will get hostile.", "Woo hoo! Curious,  though, why wait until Monday to give notice?", "You can tell how toxic this boss must be, when op made the comment \u201ckind, normal person\u201d. So pleased to see op is moving upwards.", "Yeah! Fuck em!", "The big tech companies gave people 2 months of notice and paid them to do no work. That seems more than fair. They basically have 2 months of pay and benefits to search full time and line up a new job.", "Sometimes you look at a painting and you see an amazing scene of people sitting dancing and playing.

A dot. And then you notice that the entire painting is dots. \n\nThat entire scene was just dots all along. \n\nSometimes you see the first red flag. And after taking a closer look at where you are, you notice it is all read flags all the way down. And now you can see nothing but red flags, all from that first one you noticed.", "An upgrade a boss felt comfortable demanding be given to him, who didn't have the authority to do so, citing a policy that doesn't exist.\n\nIt only looks like a single instance, but when examined shows so much more.", "> It really sucks that OP has to just walk out without letting Toxic Boss know that it was her entire lack of protocol about the flight that caused this \n\nEven if OP didn't have their reputation to preserve and got to do this, I doubt Toxic Boss is that kind of person who'll take feedback anyway.", "\"I was offered a new opportunity\" is better. It implies they came looking for OP rather than OP went looking gor a new position.", "That depends on the size of the company.", "Hopefully the boss has a superior with an ounce of business acumen who finds out about this through HR or an exit interview.", "This insane boss was never going to be a good reference. Maybe there\u2019s another person at the company who could give a fair reference but if I planned to ask anyone, I would inform them about the reasons for leaving.

Sending you home is considered firing so they have to pay you.", "Also an option but you won't get much in the sense of petty revenge as HR will likely open the req and notify the manager. \n\nI get an automated email anytime HR opens a req for my task area.", "I know this is the case in other countries that actually give a shit about their employees.

What good does it do OP?", "TYpically the insane boss is not who is going to be talked to during a reference check, it'll be some random paper pusher in HR and if you give no notice (or any of the other petty things I mentioned) you will likely get a refusal of reference check or a negative referral.", "You worked in telecommunications or another utility company didn't you?", "That is the \"official reference check\" performed from one HR to another.\n\nIt's employment, position, tenure, and often if they left on their own terms or were terminated.
