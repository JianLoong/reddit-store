The company, of course, did not have this policy. I also took your advice to get out of that job quickly and am happy to say I\u2019m starting a new job in 3 weeks! \n\nI know the person who will be my supervisor in my new job and she is a very kind, normal person. \n\nPretty nervous to give my notice to the toxic boss on Monday, but oh well, if she\u2019s nasty then my 2 weeks notice will just become an immediate resignation. We live in a one-party consent for recording state and plan to record the phone conversation to protect myself. \n\nThanks to all of you for giving me the push to move on!", "created_utc": 1681925863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s40ht/update_aita_for_not_giving_my_boss_my_first_class/", "score": 575, "replies": ["Hey OP, I am glad to see this update! \n\nI was surprised by the entitlement your boss had. \n\nYour boss( soon to be ex) was unprofessional, make sure remember that when they want to \u201ctalk\u201d to you. \n\nYou handled the airport interaction perfectly. There is nothing they can say but to downplay that situation.", "Good for you OP!  There is one thing I suggest, though.  Do not put your 2 weeks in to the toxic boss.  Go to their immediate supervisor, if possible.  If they ask why, mention your new job and toxic boss.", "Congrats on the new gig! And when you meet with her, if she asks why you're leaving, just tell her it's a general \"lack of respect for protocol\" around the office (e.g., like treating employees with a modicum of respect).", "Please update us on her response to your resignation, I love when toxic bosses get all shocked Pikachu when people start to flee the company. Congratulations!", "I don't know if I'd bother giving 2 weeks notice because she may say your last day is today. And then you won't have a job until the new one starts. Pending your savings and how bad you need the money and when your first paycheck arrives for the new job. \n\nCould you use your vacation and sick time, then just give a 3-5 day notice?", "2 weeks? Do jobs/corporations give employees 2 weeks notice before they lay thousands off? Workers give employers a lot more consideration than employers do workers.", "Congrats OP!", "Yea OP! Wishing you the best in your new job! Forget them- it\u2019s their loss- not yours", "Oh hey I remember this! Super happy you\u2019re getting out of that toxic environment and kudos to you for taking action\n\nAlso don\u2019t turn in a two-week notice. Work then leave. Don\u2019t tell her a damn thing.*\n\n*If you\u2019re an American", "I used to handle travel for several executives. One time, an EVP and a subordinate were flying from the East coast (USA) to the West coast (long flight). There was a mechanical problem with the airplane, so the airline changed to a smaller airplane, as that was all that was available. Both executives were originally booked in first class on the flight. After the change, the EVP was no longer in first class, but the subordinate remained. As the subordinate was EVP's pet flying monkey, he couldn't say anything to him and risk losing his most loyal follower, so I was yelled at for 45 minutes, taken to HR to be written up (HR woman was clearly unsure how to handle the situation) and subjected to weeks of petty, punitive behavior from both EVP & his pet. A few years later, when the company decided to institute profit sharing, I was specifically left out (by that time EVP was promoted to president & pet to EVP). As they were gloating about it, I announced I was moving abroad to paradise. Fuck you Dan, you fucking phoney! And fuck you Mark, you flying monkey!", "Boy that boss is gonna feel all kinds of stupid for losing an employee over throwing a fit over an airplane seat. \n\nFAFO", "Agree! Two weeks are courtesy", "Or hand the two weeks notice in to the HR dept.", "I second this.", "Don\u2019t do that, she might try to retaliate (for example trying to figure out which company OP is going to and contacting them badmouthing OP). Best to just say \u201cI am looking for a new opportunity\u201d and leave it at that.", "And then they either need to pay her for the 2 weeks or pay unemployment who will pay her for the 2 weeks. Firing someone who drops notice isn't a particularly good plan.", "It depends, in my country you have to give 2 weeks notice to quit a job as an employee. As an employers its at least 1 month after probation period, unless the employee did something really bad.  Even if you gave a notice for 2 weeks and the boss tells you, that you don't have to work, you are still entitled to your pay.", "In the USA, if you put in your two weeks notice and they fire you on the spot, then you are entitled to unemployment for those two weeks, because they fired you on their terms without actual cause.  My old job tried to do that to me, then expected me to (after I was gone) to work with them to get the new guy up to speed at the old rate.  I was like, that isn't how any of this is going to work.  Either you keep me on, and I train people, or you fire me I collect unemployment, and we can see what my contract labor rate is in the future."]}
