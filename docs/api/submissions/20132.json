I went to a party for fathers day with my bf and baby at MILs house. I had already been upset that day just due to PPD hormones but for the most part the party was okay, Until i went to feed my daughter (i breastfeed) and i do not do it openly i cover myself and her with a blanketL. i am not exposed but my bf came to me and asked me to go to a different room because he could see, (he could only see when standing directly above me). I got upset because i didnt need to go to a different room. I found out later the reason he said that was because his dad and brother said it was making them uncomfortable. That had me fuming. Why is it uncomfortable for me to feed my daughter? I was not exposing myself, I should not be forced to move somewhere else just to give her food. Now i dont think i want them at my babys birthday. I dont need drama because i want to feed my daughter and they are uncomfortable with the most natural thing in the world. WIBTA?\n\nBy the way i do not want to uninvite the MIL the reason i have to is because if i tell her FIL is not invited she won't come anyways.\nAlso i do understand it was thier home i was not comfortable with thier asking so i did leave i didnt argue anyone or start a scene just left instead\n\nMy reason for posting this is to see if i should uninvite the family. with my PPD lately i can be overactive and i just wanted some insight on what to do\n\nI think a lot of my anger is coming from past events and that my bf does nothing for me and has tried to ban my family from seeing my baby just because my mom held her first at the hospital and when i disagreed he blew up on me idek if my anger truly is towards his family maybe a little but i think its mostly towards my bf hes banned my mom multiple times from our place and got into a huge physical fight at a family friends bday because he was drunk and spat of the person whos bday it was and it just escalated from there", "created_utc": 1687257407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e7kku/wibta_for_not_wanting_my_mil_at_my_daughters/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do they need to grow up? Yes. Is this a bit of an overreaction to two males feeling uncomfortable seeing their daughter/sis in law breastfeeding? Also yes. They are your family. Do not uninvite them, but tell them if they do not want to see you breastfeeding in your own home then *they* can leave the room.\n\nAs an aside, I see you were at your MIL's house for the father's day party. Honestly, if I were in someone else's home, I would probably excuse myself if that was what the homeowner preferred.

You are NTA for sure for breastfeeding with a blanket.

Also, tell your bf that he is not to come over and deliver any messages about breastfeeding from the cowards.", "So what's the beef with the MIL?", "NTA but you're handling this pretty badly.\n\nyour problem is your boyfriend.    He was out of line.  Tell him that you will breastfeed, whether or not you 'cover' is a personal choice (expect that babies will not tolerate that past early infancy, would you want to eat with a blanket over your head?) and you will not be going into another room and that if ANYONE makes a comment about it you expect him to shut it down.\n\nAlso the whole 'uninvite MIL because my father in law and brother in law made sexist comments and my boyfriend backed up their sexist comments' is convoluted and, well, sexist.\n\nSay what you mean.  If baby's father can't be an adult and a dad and supportive partner, throw the whole man out.  \n\n\nJust grokked the ages:   your boyfriend is a sexist pervert who quite possibly had sex with a child.

I've read your comments and I think it would be a bad move to not invite your baby's grandparents and BFs family to the party over this incident.  Their house, their rules, even if it's off.  Your house, your rules - let them know you may be breastfeeding and if they don't like it, they can go outside or not come but encourage them to look up what the general culture is about breastfeeding.\n\nBut really, you have a BF problem here.  He's not standing up for you against his family and the age discrepancy is a little bit worrisome.\n\nSome of what you are describing here may be you and their family trying to figure out dynamics and rules here and it's not going to be perfect.  Going scorched earth by not inviting them to the baby's first party may not be the precedent you want to start with here, especially with the BF not on your side.  Be kind and considerate but wary of the inlaws and your BF especially.", "I am torn between YTA and NTA - It\u00b4s your house, and your rules.\n\nI support a mother\u00b4s rights to breastfeed, and as far as I\u00b4m concerned you don\u00b4t even have to cover yourself, but if you are in someone\u00b4s house and make them feel uncomfortable, they should be able to ask you to move to another room. Beware they didn\u00b4t ask you not to breastfeed, but they asked you to do it in a different room. Whether or not you agree with that is irrelevant, that is their house and those are their rules.\n\nNow in reverse the same applies, it is your house and you should reasonably be able to do as you like. So if your MIL doesn\u00b4t like it, too bad. However, not inviting her to something as important as this, for behaviour you can still prevent, is kinda leaning towards YTA, also because rather than taking an adult stance on it, you are creating tensions between your BF and his mother. You would not be improving the situation at all.\n\nIf I were you, I would make it clear to your BF that in your house, you breastfeed, and if your inlaws can\u00b4t handle that, that is their problem. So they are welcome to join, but you expect of your BF to stand up for your rights in your house.\n\nAnd maybe I am too used to seeing women breastfeed in restaurants here, fully uncovered, but please, don\u00b4t let these prudes get to you that much ;)", "NTA - fuck them, fuck their \u201chouse rules,\u201d and fuck your BF for not putting them in their place.", "YWBTA. That action would be blowing the situation out of proportion and punishing your MIL for something that had nothing to do with her. Its great that you feel comfortable breastfeeding wherever, but you need to understand that goes against the grain of currently accepted cultural norms. At least here in the U.S., which is where I assume you are located. As such, not everyone is going to be comfortable with your choice. When you're in someone else's home, you have to abide by their rules. You could have easily gone to another room and avoided all of this unnecessary drama.", "YWBTA. Have your party.

The only one causing drama here is you. \n\nYour FIL and BIL politely asked your husband, who then politely came to you to ask you to take it to another room. You can disagree with them being uncomfortable all you want, but they were respectful and didn\u2019t cause a scene, you did. \n\nYou sound very immature. You need to grow up for the sake of your husband and your baby.", "YTA\n\nYou don't want drama.

Was it really the in-laws who were uncomfortable or husband and he was using them as an excuse?\n\nHonestly, I think the best answer here is for OP to feed the kid as they see fit (since they are doing nothing wrong) and explain to anyone uncomfortable all they have to do is not gawk.  Especially in your own house.  I don't think FiL and BiL acted well here, but they didn't exactly melt down either.

We push this new person out of our bodies, but oh gosh, don't show anyone... better still - lets fucking terrify women so they want C-sections instead.

But to argue that everything natural is automatically publicly appropriate is silly.  Pooping is as natural as eating but we do that in private rooms. Because we understand that context matters and the naturalistic fallacy is, in fact, a fallacy.\n\nAnd adults are always making pronouncements and judgements about what kind of food is ok to eat/prepare in certain contexts (see the people who think it's fine to ban fish-based meals from workplaces because they don't like the smell), and how you're 'allowed' to eat (don't chew too loud or with your mouth open, in the west don't eat most food with your hands, blah blah). \n\nMy point here is that we have conventions and restrictions around *how* we do perfectly natural things, for each other's comfort. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with someone's line in the sand being that if you have to suckle another human to feed them, that it be done privately. It's substantively different from any other way we eat for the rest of our lives to a degree that I don't think a different rule is unreasonable. \n\n\nAnd I'm so over 'breasts aren't sexual.'\n\nIf you like people doing stuff to them during sex, you can't then say they aren't sexual.

If you were bottle feeding instead we all know you\u2019d be getting crap for that. Apparently we\u2019re supposed to feed our babies through osmosis so the men of the world aren\u2019t uncomfortable. How do they think they were fed as babies? I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with that, and I think you have a BF problem if he won\u2019t defend you.", "[removed]", "If you have any strong willed family members or outspoken nursing mother friends invite them and see how the conversation goes when anyone tries to stop them or you feeding babies. \nYou won\u2019t have to say a thing in all likelihood. FIL and BIL may even read the room and there will be zero issues. \nNTA for how you feel but don\u2019t exclude them, bring advocates instead and change the power balance, the in laws will be the drama queens if they start anything.", "I wouldn't jump to uninviting them just yet. I'd just flat out tell all 3 of them that if they will be uncomfortable with you feeding your child, in your own home, they should stay at theirs.  I'd set some serious boundaries and see if they can comply. Bc uninviting is going to go nuclear and start bugger flights.", "YTA. you also need to get medical help for your ppd, it's making you not think rationally. This will be different because it's your house and your mil did nothing wrong. You're just hellbent on starting ww3 and if you're in the wrong, you'll lose and cause friction with your husband.", "YWBTA for not inviting them unfortunately. \nI say this very gently and from a place of love and experience so don\u2019t come for me. I think breast feeding is a beautiful natural thing that shouldn\u2019t be hid. Unfortunately, for most men, titties are titties. I would not want my husbands father and brother to see my boobs even in that context bc men see boobies, not you breastfeeding your child. A lot of men are unable or unwilling to see them in a non sexual context. It\u2019s gross, it\u2019s not your problem, but I imagine it is kinda weird for your husband to navigate. Im not saying you should care, it\u2019s just sort of an unfortunate truth that we should all consider/be aware of. In my head, every time they see me after this they would think about the fact that they\u2019ve seen my boobs and that\u2019s just not the energy I want floating around my family. If you\u2019re okay with that, more power to you. I admire how passionate you are about your right to openly breast feed without being sexualized but im not sure how much control you actually have over that. Just good for thought!", "YTA.\n\nBecause you're not actually addressing the issue. \n\nYou're angry, with reason, with your boyfriend. \n\nYou are angry with his father and brother being uncomfortable with you breastfeeding and YOUR BOYFRIEND not standing up for you. \n\nHe's literally trying to ban your mom from your house, and you're letting it happen. \n\nIn all this, your MIL has apparently done nothing to warrant the title. But your BF definitely has.\n\nAnd no, it's not just hormones talking. Don't let yourself be tricked into thinking it's just hormones making you like this.", "INFO: How old are you?", "Dump this guy. There are tons of red flags. This is already starting to show signs of abuse, ie alienating your family. That being said, NTA.", "YTA you are going to cause and escalate drama. Yes breastfeeding is natural but you can understand how it might not be comfortable to you father and brother in law to see in close proximity. Your idea to uninvite that entire side of the family is a nuclear option and will only create more issues.", "You have a SO problem.  I think you should be more concerned about him than your in laws.  If you invite them just feed baby anywhere you want.   Don\u2019t let them force you out of the room in your home.   They can leave if they are uncomfortable.", "ESH - it's not fair to uninvite MIL regardless if she'll come with or without your FIL. \n\nContinue to breastfeed when you want, it's not taboo, it's feeding a child. If somebody is uncomfortable they should remove themselves from the situation. \n\nComments about getting the bed wet when breastfeeding isn't correct, if baby is latching correctly not much is 'wasted' so going to a bedroom wouldn't matter. If it is then you need a review of latching. (Coming from a breastfeeding Mum of 2). \n\nYou need to think about your BF and your relationship, I think you already know he's not good for you or what you want, take all the comments on board and really think if it's worth this for the rest of your life.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" but my bf came to me and asked me to go to a different room because he could see,\" ..but: Your BF is the Ah, not MIL.

Huge YTA", "INFO are you 100% sure that FIL and BIL were truely uncomfortable? Or is it possible your boyfriend was projecting and said that in an effort to control the situation?", "This is one of those lizard brain issues. Everyone feels a bit awkward at seeing a bit of boob on someone they\u2019re not used to seeing boob on. But, as a reasonable adult you recognise that there is a greater good to aim for here and you get over it. Don\u2019t cut out your MIL but I agree what anyone who makes a scene about seeing breastfeeding is a simpleton. ESH", "ESH except your MIL who did nothing wrong and seems to be singled out in the title for some reason? BIL and FIL are both really immature and need to get over themselves. You were covered, and baby needed to eat. But on the other hand you were in their home, where they should be able to feel comfortable, and therefore uninviting them seems like an overreaction. Have they ever said anything like this while in your home? Or out in public? You don\u2019t mention it and it seems this is the first time it\u2019s brought up so I doubt it. Sometimes this is just not the hill to die on, and as long as they aren\u2019t trying to control what you do outside their home, then it might be better to bite your tongue and just deal with it.", "Your bf sounds awful and I wonder if it was actually HIM who was uncomfortable with this brother and dad being in the room while you breastfed rather than them mentioning it to him.", "YTA", "I think yta for not inviting your boyfriends mom because she appears to be literally the only member of that family you _don't_ have a problem with.\n\nIf you have an issue with your boyfriends _father_ or your _boyfriend_, bring it up with those two dudes.

You're not the asshole for wanting to feed your child, but you and your BF need counseling. There's obviously way more to this situation than just one incident. Get some help, for your child's sake. Uninviting family to such an important occasion is a big decision, so don't take it lightly.", "YTA. Basically your problem is with your bf, and partly with FIL & BIL, not with your MIL. What you need to do is just keep breastfeeding like you\u2019ve been doing so far, and tell FIL&BIL to look the other way.
