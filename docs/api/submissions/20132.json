I went to a party for fathers day with my bf and baby at MILs house. I had already been upset that day just due to PPD hormones but for the most part the party was okay, Until i went to feed my daughter (i breastfeed) and i do not do it openly i cover myself and her with a blanketL. i am not exposed but my bf came to me and asked me to go to a different room because he could see, (he could only see when standing directly above me). I got upset because i didnt need to go to a different room. I found out later the reason he said that was because his dad and brother said it was making them uncomfortable. That had me fuming. Why is it uncomfortable for me to feed my daughter? I was not exposing myself, I should not be forced to move somewhere else just to give her food. Now i dont think i want them at my babys birthday. I dont need drama because i want to feed my daughter and they are uncomfortable with the most natural thing in the world. WIBTA?\n\nBy the way i do not want to uninvite the MIL the reason i have to is because if i tell her FIL is not invited she won't come anyways.\nAlso i do understand it was thier home i was not comfortable with thier asking so i did leave i didnt argue anyone or start a scene just left instead\n\nMy reason for posting this is to see if i should uninvite the family. with my PPD lately i can be overactive and i just wanted some insight on what to do\n\nI think a lot of my anger is coming from past events and that my bf does nothing for me and has tried to ban my family from seeing my baby just because my mom held her first at the hospital and when i disagreed he blew up on me idek if my anger truly is towards his family maybe a little but i think its mostly towards my bf hes banned my mom multiple times from our place and got into a huge physical fight at a family friends bday because he was drunk and spat of the person whos bday it was and it just escalated from there", "created_utc": 1687257407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e7kku/wibta_for_not_wanting_my_mil_at_my_daughters/", "score": 614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not uninvite them, but tell them if they do not want to see you breastfeeding in your own home then *they* can leave the room.\n\nAs an aside, I see you were at your MIL's house for the father's day party. Honestly, if I were in someone else's home, I would probably excuse myself if that was what the homeowner preferred.

You are NTA for sure for breastfeeding with a blanket.

Also, tell your bf that he is not to come over and deliver any messages about breastfeeding from the cowards.", "So what's the beef with the MIL?", "NTA but you're handling this pretty badly.\n\nyour problem is your boyfriend.    He was out of line.  Tell him that you will breastfeed, whether or not you 'cover' is a personal choice (expect that babies will not tolerate that past early infancy, would you want to eat with a blanket over your head?) and you will not be going into another room and that if ANYONE makes a comment about it you expect him to shut it down.\n\nAlso the whole 'uninvite MIL because my father in law and brother in law made sexist comments and my boyfriend backed up their sexist comments' is convoluted and, well, sexist.\n\nSay what you mean.  If baby's father can't be an adult and a dad and supportive partner, throw the whole man out.  \n\n\nJust grokked the ages:   your boyfriend is a sexist pervert who quite possibly had sex with a child.

I've read your comments and I think it would be a bad move to not invite your baby's grandparents and BFs family to the party over this incident.  Their house, their rules, even if it's off.  Your house, your rules - let them know you may be breastfeeding and if they don't like it, they can go outside or not come but encourage them to look up what the general culture is about breastfeeding.\n\nBut really, you have a BF problem here.  He's not standing up for you against his family and the age discrepancy is a little bit worrisome.\n\nSome of what you are describing here may be you and their family trying to figure out dynamics and rules here and it's not going to be perfect.  Going scorched earth by not inviting them to the baby's first party may not be the precedent you want to start with here, especially with the BF not on your side.  Be kind and considerate but wary of the inlaws and your BF especially.", "I am torn between YTA and NTA - It\u00b4s your house, and your rules.\n\nI support a mother\u00b4s rights to breastfeed, and as far as I\u00b4m concerned you don\u00b4t even have to cover yourself, but if you are in someone\u00b4s house and make them feel uncomfortable, they should be able to ask you to move to another room. Beware they didn\u00b4t ask you not to breastfeed, but they asked you to do it in a different room. Whether or not you agree with that is irrelevant, that is their house and those are their rules.\n\nNow in reverse the same applies, it is your house and you should reasonably be able to do as you like. So if your MIL doesn\u00b4t like it, too bad. However, not inviting her to something as important as this, for behaviour you can still prevent, is kinda leaning towards YTA, also because rather than taking an adult stance on it, you are creating tensions between your BF and his mother. You would not be improving the situation at all.\n\nIf I were you, I would make it clear to your BF that in your house, you breastfeed, and if your inlaws can\u00b4t handle that, that is their problem. So they are welcome to join, but you expect of your BF to stand up for your rights in your house.\n\nAnd maybe I am too used to seeing women breastfeed in restaurants here, fully uncovered, but please, don\u00b4t let these prudes get to you that much ;)", "NTA - fuck them, fuck their \u201chouse rules,\u201d and fuck your BF for not putting them in their place.", "YWBTA. That action would be blowing the situation out of proportion and punishing your MIL for something that had nothing to do with her. Its great that you feel comfortable breastfeeding wherever, but you need to understand that goes against the grain of currently accepted cultural norms. At least here in the U.S., which is where I assume you are located. As such, not everyone is going to be comfortable with your choice. When you're in someone else's home, you have to abide by their rules. You could have easily gone to another room and avoided all of this unnecessary drama.", "YWBTA. Have your party.

The only one causing drama here is you. \n\nYour FIL and BIL politely asked your husband, who then politely came to you to ask you to take it to another room. You can disagree with them being uncomfortable all you want, but they were respectful and didn\u2019t cause a scene, you did. \n\nYou sound very immature. You need to grow up for the sake of your husband and your baby.", "YTA\n\nYou don't want drama.

Was it really the in-laws who were uncomfortable or husband and he was using them as an excuse?\n\nHonestly, I think the best answer here is for OP to feed the kid as they see fit (since they are doing nothing wrong) and explain to anyone uncomfortable all they have to do is not gawk.  Especially in your own house.  I don't think FiL and BiL acted well here, but they didn't exactly melt down either.

We push this new person out of our bodies, but oh gosh, don't show anyone... better still - lets fucking terrify women so they want C-sections instead.

But to argue that everything natural is automatically publicly appropriate is silly.  Pooping is as natural as eating but we do that in private rooms. Because we understand that context matters and the naturalistic fallacy is, in fact, a fallacy.\n\nAnd adults are always making pronouncements and judgements about what kind of food is ok to eat/prepare in certain contexts (see the people who think it's fine to ban fish-based meals from workplaces because they don't like the smell), and how you're 'allowed' to eat (don't chew too loud or with your mouth open, in the west don't eat most food with your hands, blah blah). \n\nMy point here is that we have conventions and restrictions around *how* we do perfectly natural things, for each other's comfort. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with someone's line in the sand being that if you have to suckle another human to feed them, that it be done privately. It's substantively different from any other way we eat for the rest of our lives to a degree that I don't think a different rule is unreasonable. \n\n\nAnd I'm so over 'breasts aren't sexual.'\n\nIf you like people doing stuff to them during sex, you can't then say they aren't sexual.
