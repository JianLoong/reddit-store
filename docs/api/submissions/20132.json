I went to a party for fathers day with my bf and baby at MILs house. I had already been upset that day just due to PPD hormones but for the most part the party was okay, Until i went to feed my daughter (i breastfeed) and i do not do it openly i cover myself and her with a blanketL. i am not exposed but my bf came to me and asked me to go to a different room because he could see, (he could only see when standing directly above me). I got upset because i didnt need to go to a different room. I found out later the reason he said that was because his dad and brother said it was making them uncomfortable. That had me fuming. Why is it uncomfortable for me to feed my daughter? I was not exposing myself, I should not be forced to move somewhere else just to give her food. Now i dont think i want them at my babys birthday. I dont need drama because i want to feed my daughter and they are uncomfortable with the most natural thing in the world. WIBTA?\n\nBy the way i do not want to uninvite the MIL the reason i have to is because if i tell her FIL is not invited she won't come anyways.\nAlso i do understand it was thier home i was not comfortable with thier asking so i did leave i didnt argue anyone or start a scene just left instead\n\nMy reason for posting this is to see if i should uninvite the family. with my PPD lately i can be overactive and i just wanted some insight on what to do\n\nI think a lot of my anger is coming from past events and that my bf does nothing for me and has tried to ban my family from seeing my baby just because my mom held her first at the hospital and when i disagreed he blew up on me idek if my anger truly is towards his family maybe a little but i think its mostly towards my bf hes banned my mom multiple times from our place and got into a huge physical fight at a family friends bday because he was drunk and spat of the person whos bday it was and it just escalated from there\n\nUpdate- i have talked with MIL and let her know shes welcome at my babys bday but i will be breastfeeding covered and if anyone comes to me and tells me it makes them uncomfortable they will be asked to leave and i let my bf know i said that and it seemed to make him angry all i wanted to do by messaging is letting them know where i stand on this issue that has really affected me emotionally its made me quite upset because they still have an issue with me because after my bf got into that physical fight i went to my moms for a few days and although i literally punched one of the guys in the face when they jumped him they think badly because i stayed st my moms for a few days", "created_utc": 1687257407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e7kku/wibta_for_not_wanting_my_mil_at_my_daughters/", "score": 1730, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not uninvite them, but tell them if they do not want to see you breastfeeding in your own home then *they* can leave the room.\n\nAs an aside, I see you were at your MIL's house for the father's day party. Honestly, if I were in someone else's home, I would probably excuse myself if that was what the homeowner preferred.

He was out of line.  Tell him that you will breastfeed, whether or not you 'cover' is a personal choice (expect that babies will not tolerate that past early infancy, would you want to eat with a blanket over your head?) and you will not be going into another room and that if ANYONE makes a comment about it you expect him to shut it down.\n\nAlso the whole 'uninvite MIL because my father in law and brother in law made sexist comments and my boyfriend backed up their sexist comments' is convoluted and, well, sexist.\n\nSay what you mean.  If baby's father can't be an adult and a dad and supportive partner, throw the whole man out.  \n\n\nJust grokked the ages:   your boyfriend is a sexist pervert who quite possibly had sex with a child.

I've read your comments and I think it would be a bad move to not invite your baby's grandparents and BFs family to the party over this incident.  Their house, their rules, even if it's off.  Your house, your rules - let them know you may be breastfeeding and if they don't like it, they can go outside or not come but encourage them to look up what the general culture is about breastfeeding.\n\nBut really, you have a BF problem here.  He's not standing up for you against his family and the age discrepancy is a little bit worrisome.\n\nSome of what you are describing here may be you and their family trying to figure out dynamics and rules here and it's not going to be perfect.  Going scorched earth by not inviting them to the baby's first party may not be the precedent you want to start with here, especially with the BF not on your side.  Be kind and considerate but wary of the inlaws and your BF especially.\n\nETA based on comments and past posts etc.  You need to get away from your toxic abusive BF.  He's the problem here and likes it this way, being the \"good guy\" between his parents and you.  Go for custody and child support.  Start documenting everything he does and has done to help you get full custody.", "I am torn between YTA and NTA - It\u00b4s your house, and your rules.\n\nI support a mother\u00b4s rights to breastfeed, and as far as I\u00b4m concerned you don\u00b4t even have to cover yourself, but if you are in someone\u00b4s house and make them feel uncomfortable, they should be able to ask you to move to another room. Beware they didn\u00b4t ask you not to breastfeed, but they asked you to do it in a different room. Whether or not you agree with that is irrelevant, that is their house and those are their rules.\n\nNow in reverse the same applies, it is your house and you should reasonably be able to do as you like. So if your MIL doesn\u00b4t like it, too bad. However, not inviting her to something as important as this, for behaviour you can still prevent, is kinda leaning towards YTA, also because rather than taking an adult stance on it, you are creating tensions between your BF and his mother. You would not be improving the situation at all.\n\nIf I were you, I would make it clear to your BF that in your house, you breastfeed, and if your inlaws can\u00b4t handle that, that is their problem. So they are welcome to join, but you expect of your BF to stand up for your rights in your house.\n\nAnd maybe I am too used to seeing women breastfeed in restaurants here, fully uncovered, but please, don\u00b4t let these prudes get to you that much ;)", "NTA - fuck them, fuck their \u201chouse rules,\u201d and fuck your BF for not putting them in their place.", "YWBTA. That action would be blowing the situation out of proportion and punishing your MIL for something that had nothing to do with her. Its great that you feel comfortable breastfeeding wherever, but you need to understand that goes against the grain of currently accepted cultural norms. At least here in the U.S., which is where I assume you are located. As such, not everyone is going to be comfortable with your choice. When you're in someone else's home, you have to abide by their rules. You could have easily gone to another room and avoided all of this unnecessary drama.", "YWBTA. Have your party.

Especially in your own house.  I don't think FiL and BiL acted well here, but they didn't exactly melt down either.

We push this new person out of our bodies, but oh gosh, don't show anyone... better still - lets fucking terrify women so they want C-sections instead.

But to argue that everything natural is automatically publicly appropriate is silly.  Pooping is as natural as eating but we do that in private rooms.

It's substantively different from any other way we eat for the rest of our lives to a degree that I don't think a different rule is unreasonable. \n\n\nAnd I'm so over 'breasts aren't sexual.'\n\nIf you like people doing stuff to them during sex, you can't then say they aren't sexual.

And in that instance, in their home, they\u2019re allowed to say something. As long as they\u2019re not restricting the baby food and telling you not to do it all, it\u2019s not a ridiculous ask to ask you to excuse yourself. Hell, my kids (especially by 1) always fed better in a quiet room without all the other stimulations. \n\nIf you were at the store or playground and they said something, tough shit.

In the Uk, a 6th form college is not like being in secondary school. And many people don\u2019t go on to do any further education afterwards. When I left school for 6th form, there were many girls who didn\u2019t do A Levels and got jobs; and many guys who had done the same and were working in the same jobs. I suppose lots of them found they had a very similar life. Circumstances differ from person to person, country to country. My only point in this entire debate is that we have laws to protect the most vulnerable and outside of that, morality shouldn\u2019t be used as a pseudo-law - that\u2019s for the fundamentalists to use.
