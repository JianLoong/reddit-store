My parents are now his legal guardians.

We are close and talk every day but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that we didn\u2019t exactly live in the same home.\n\nSo for the sake of husband\u2019s joke yes I did grow up an only child.\n\nI briefly summarised it to Rue and thought that was it.\n\nAfterwards I\u2019ve received a long message from her which basically says that she is adopted and she found my attitude towards adopted siblings to be cruel and dismissive. She said she feels sorry for my brother and can\u2019t believe how easy I find it to disregard him as well as a bunch of stuff that boils down to me being self serving and not being worthy of a place in my own family\n\nI didn\u2019t intend what I said to disinherit my brother, was I TA?", "created_utc": 1681464769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lr89h/aita_for_referring_to_myself_as_an_only_child/", "score": 1430, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad had a daughter with his first wife, she's 10 years older than me and grew up living with her mom.

You have a younger sibling now, but you grew up as a single child - you were 20 when your cousin was put under your parent's care.

You did grow up an only child. NTA.", "NTA. Her own issues with her adoption are her problem. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate your relationship with others.

You have a sibling now, but didn't until you were grown. It sounds like they may just be overly sensitive to the subject.", "NTA - you were raised an only child. The rest of her complaint is her own baggage spilling all over the place. Messy. She can judge you all she wants, what difference does it make to your life?

As an only child myself (literally), I don't get what her being adopted has to do with it? Plus you are an only child so you had a right to join in on the joke as far as that's concerned.

Be careful of her in the future.", "NTA\n\nthe premise of the joke was in reference to psychological features specific to being an only child.\n\nI have 4 step siblings who I never lived with and a half brother that's 20 yrs junior. I moved out the year he was born (coincidental, there's no bad blood). So a very real sibling, that I perhaps don't know THAT well.\n\nFor all intents and purposes in this joke I too am a single child.", "You were RAISED an only child, you aren't an only child anymore.

Your friend definitely has a trauma wound that was projected on your situation.", "My cousin is about to be 31 and her brother is 3.

No, but they didn't grow up together and will never live together.\n\nNTA. This person is projecting her own issues on you.", "NTA. \n\nYou grew up an only child. Period. The end. \n\nThe fact that your parents adopted a child when you were 20 means you HAVE a sibling, but it doesn\u2019t change HOW you grew up. \n\nYou never acted as though your brother was less than in any way. You simply grew up as an only child. If Rue can\u2019t understand that\u2026..then she\u2019s willingly choosing to be offended (and clearly bringing her own baggage in).", "NTA. You were an only *child*. By the time your parents had another child, you were not one.

He is your cousin.", "NTA I know someone who calls herself an only child because her siblings are like 20 years older than her, and she never shared a house with other children.

Perfect example of a her-problem, not a your-problem. Let it go.", "NTA. You did grow up an only child, and now you have a brother, yes, but for all intents and purposes you didn't grow up an older sibling.\n\nAll the comments here are correct. Rue is projecting her own issues on you, which is unfair. I'd send her a text to clarify the situation\u2014maybe even send her this post to check the replies\u2014and make sure to shut that down. Both you and your now brother were raised only children! This happens with blood related siblings who have a big age difference too!\n\nRue probably needs to talk to a professional regarding her own baggage, which is now spilling onto others. But you're fine, OP.", "NTA. I'm similar as my parents adopted a young child from foster care when I was in college. Obviously I care about her and consider her a part of our family, but I don't think of her as a sister- we never lived in the same house (or even the same area), I grew up very much as the only child in my household, and we don't have a \"sister\" relationship. It's not dismissing your brother or adopted children in general to say you grew up as an only child.", "NTA. Rue is projecting. You are an only child. At the end of the day, he's still your cousin. You moved out before he moved in, so you grew up without him. It's great that you were able to form a sibling like relationship given the stage of life you were at, but she needs to talk to her own family about her issues.", "NTA. I have a sister who I grew up with and as an adult, we found out we had a half brother who had lived the other side of the planet since he was a kid. We\u2019ve met him a couple of times and he\u2019s lovely, so is his family. But honestly, I don\u2019t have the same feelings towards him as I do my sister as we didn\u2019t spend any of our formative years together and I think that\u2019s the difference.", "Its not that he's adopted, its that he wasn't there for the first 20 years of your life.

Say that you aren\u2019t discrediting or invalidating her views as an adoptee, but it is wrong for her to project them into your family. \n\nYou grew up an only child.

Completely different situation from Rue.", "NTA. You said you grew up an only child. Which you did.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t disregard your brother. You literally were raised as an only child. You were an adult already when your brother came into the picture.

It is your cousin, not your brother so yes you are an only child.", "Rue has it about right.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to play both sides of that fence. You have a sibling, or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t get to say you are an only child simply because of an age difference - and you surely wouldn\u2019t had this been a biological rather than adopted sibling.\n\nThe first words out of your mouth should have been a protesting explanation - \u201cmy sibling is much younger so I was a solo child at ten, but I am not an only child.\u201d\n\nYTA, and a cruel one at that.

It IS different.", "NTA\n\nRue has some stones to even approach someone like that who they just met.  You did nothing offensive, I think Rue is just sensitive.", "NTA  Rue is cherry picking info from what you told her to suit her own agenda.  You very clearly did grow up an only child, as you said, and you consider him your brother.  \n\nI think I'd respond with \"I'm confused by your reaction to this.  Again, I grew up an only child.  That's a fact.  X joined our family when I was 17/18.  He has been my brother ever since, for 10 years now.  I'm not sure why you felt that was cruel or dismissive, but I'm hurt that you would think that of me, especially since you don't know him or anything of the relationship we have.\"\n\nShe owes you an apology, but I wouldn't hold your breath.", "NTA - I am also adopted and have no idea where she got off...honestly even if he was your bio brother born 10 years ago the joke would still hold considering you were raised as the only child in your house...I think some people are just drama llamas and need something to be mad about in order to spice up their lives \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f don't let it bother you - I'm sure your brother knows you love him \ud83d\udc96", "NTA.  \"Do I look like a bellhop?  Deal with your own baggage please, and leave me out if it\", would have been the correct response.  Your comments had nothing to do with her, and her taking offense to a joke between you and your brother is totally on her.", "NTA. She has some issues to sort out, and they have nothing to do with you. I was also raised pretty much an only child, because my siblings were adults when I was born. I love them dearly, they are very much my siblings, but we were not under the same roof after I was 3 and I don\u2019t remember them living with me.", "NTA. My brother is 10 years older than I am. He left for university when I was 8, so I was basically raised as an only child. \n\nPlot twist, he actually was adopted! But it's the age gap that makes the difference,, not the blood relationship.", "NTA as an adopted person, yes your cousin is your brother and for all practical and real purposes you were an only child growing up and in some ways you are now. Also on the flip side, just because I have biological half siblings that does not make them my siblings. My only sibling is my brother I grew up with because we have shared experiences growing up being cared for by the same people. As of right now you don\u2019t have those shared childhood experiences with your little brother. This doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love him but it\u2019s different than growing up with each other and playing with super soakers in the back yard or fighting over who broke the vase because you were playing soccer in the house.", "NTA - Rue needs to deal with her own trauma. Everyone's family works differently. Ignore her.", "nta Rue's in her feelings", "I mean he\u2019s your cousin\n\nI\u2019m an adoptee too and can easily understand the logic here. You have no sibling dynamic. You have a legit cousin dynamic and closer than my cousin dynamic actually \n\nShe\u2019s projecting way too much. Yeah I have issues with how the world sees me and refers to my parents. But that\u2019s not even closely related to your specific story\n\nSide note\u2014he\u2019s also basically being raised an an only child. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  \nYou didn't grow up as an only child. You ARE an only \"child\" in that aspect. Having a brother later in life after you're grown, you can still develop only child syndrome while a kid.", "NTA, OP. I have two older sisters, a younger brother and a younger sister. Both of my older sisters are ten years older than me, one has the same mom but a different dad so I never met her until I was around 14 or 15. My other sister has the same dad but a different mom, but I always visited her side of the family and was raised around them. Due to unfortunate circumstances my mom was unable to raise my younger brother and sister so they grew up with our aunt on our dad's side after my dad passed, so while I have bio siblings I am an only child because that's how I was raised, that doesn't mean I don't treat my younger siblings like they're not my siblings, because they very much are and I love them very much. You are very close with your brother, but were not raised under the same roof, making you an only child without discrediting your relationship with your younger brother.", "NTA. Tell her she over stepped and since she didn\u2019t know your family dynamics she doesn\u2019t know you well enough to comment on this matter. You have every right to be offended.", "NTA. The joke was about being raised as an only child which is true. Even if your parents had a bio sibling the same age, your personality is still influenced by being an only child for so long.", "Rue (again, you people really need to come up with better fake names, like Ezmerelda or Tigerlady) is PROJECTING.

I don\u2019t know, but these issues about adoption have nothing to do with you.\n\nShe sounds really unhappy and is looking for a handy target for her anger. And there you were. That was mighty nice of you to show up for the lead role in her revenge drama, and right on time. Well done!\n\nHere is the \u201ctell\u201d in the text she sent you:\n\n\u201cNot being worthy of a place in my own family\u201d.\n\nTHAT\u2019S HER. That\u2019s exactly what she was told. She wasn\u2019t worthy and her biological family did not want her and maybe still don\u2019t. \n\nShe has some serious issues and I would keep my distance from her lest she have some magical powers that could turn you into a rat or something?", "NTA. Rue is out of line, pay no attention to her.", "NTA  \nYou told the facts. You were raised an only child. You have an adopted brother which you are close to but, he was adopted after you moved out.", "NTA\n\nYou grew up as an only child which is where you would get \"Only Child Syndrome\", jokingly or not.", "NTA - for all intents and purposes you were raised as an only child since your childhood was spent as the only child living in the house.\n\nAlso FWIW, your cousin is not legally your brother as your parents didn't adopt him. They are his legal guardians per his post which is a different relationship. Unless the laws of your jurisdiction are different, an adoption is a very specific legal relationship which covers the legal relationship of parent and child for the rest of their lives. A child who is adopted is as much the child of the adoptive parents as a bio child and would be the legal sibling as well. Even as an adult, an adopted child and their children would adopt as bio children whereas the relationship of a \"legal\" guardian generally terminates when they are no longer a minor or could probably be altered much more simply than renouncing a child you have adopted - just as renouncing your bio children isn't simple in most jurisdictions.\n\nWhile you may love your cousin and your parents may feel parental towards him, that is because of bonds of affection that have developed especially so with you since you hardly lived with him - especially as a child.", " NTA, I have a friend who\u2019s parents had children once every decade about. So they always think of theirselves as an only child since their siblings were not in the house after about 5 years old. \n\nYour experience growing up and in your formative years was that of an only child.", "NTA.

I would find it strange to call my cousin my brother anyway? Also Rue is projecting her issues on to you, not your fault.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't grow up together it's hard to see him as your brother.", "NTA, she\u2019s completely misinterpreting because of her own insecurities of being adopted. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "old child is a very fun typo", "It does definitely sound like Rue needs to stop taking out her baggage on OP and get therapy. I hope Rue is able to do so.", "It\u2019s not that deep. It was a light hearted joke.", "I love how you comment on someone else\u2019s math when the problem is your lack of reading comprehension. \n\nTell me, even missing the bit where it specifically said the cousins parents lost custody at 4, did you think the parents somehow lost custody and ops parents got custody right at birth?\n\nAlso, graduating high school 2 years early is far from uncommon. Multiple people in my school did it. Some people skipped more.", "You wore them out (wink)", "I'm glad your parents were there for him, and that you two have such a good relationship.", "OP isn\u2019t a child at all now, so it\u2019s pretty obvious, especially with the context, that the joke and her explanation was about her growing up as an only child.", "There are online programs that work on a sliding scale and refer you to a telehealth provider. I hope she has a similar service in her area", "It\u2019s more than just college too. In the US once the adoption is formalized, you no longer get assistance from the state for being a foster parent. They pay a stipend per child based on the child\u2019s age. That isn\u2019t paid to anyone who formally adopts their foster child.\n\nEvery state has a different amount and some states barely fund their foster care program, but in my state foster parents get over [$800](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/resources-for-foster-parents) a month per child, paid out once every three months.\n\nThat means for a lot of kinship placements, financially it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to formally adopt. With how bad the cost of living is today, many literally cannot afford it. $800 a month makes a big difference to most foster families.", "I understand that. I'm saying it from the adopted kids view", "NTA\n\nMy mom has two bio siblings who are 15+ years older than her. She often says she basically grew up as an only child since her brothers were out of the house by the time she was old enough to remember them. It sounds like Rue is projecting her own insecurities onto your story.", "NTA - I have a full sibling I\u2019ve never lived in a house with. I love her, but I definitely grew up an only child.", "I find it odd this acquaintance felt it appropriate to message you to criticize how you perceive your upbringing. I have a half brother, who I consider my brother but I sometimes say half for better context. It has nothing to with how much I care for him.

I wasn't raised with them, though.\" That is a concise way to cover having sibs but being raised an only kid.", "NTA, this is her pain and she needs to deal with that herself, her message is out of line.", "NTA. I'm my mom's only child, but my dad has 4 other children and a step-daughter. I still say I'm an only child bc I grew up as the only child in the house. Yes, I have siblings and even niblings, but I 100% have only child syndrome.", "NTA she\u2019s making your description of your relationship with your cousin/adopted brother about her.

You grew up like an only child, which is what the conversation was about. She is trying to make you feel bad for whatever reason.", "Rue has a really bad case of Main Character Syndrome.", "They were raised as only siblings. It's pretty clear. OP moved out basically right when the cousin moved in. They never lived together. They were never raised together. And biologically they're cousins. For all intents and purposes, OP is an only child. This cousin has been with her parents and in her life for 15 years so it makes sense to call each other sort of brother and sister, either because it's less confusing or they feel closer than average cousins do. But objectively OP is an only child. As is her cousin. It's really not that hard of a concept to grasp.\n\nMe and my half brother, who have a 10-year age difference, make jokes that we were only children living in the same house because we needed very different kinds of attention and up until then I had been an only child. Am I technically an only child? Of course not. But for all intents and purposes I essentially was. Just in case you wanted to say I didn't know what I was talking about.", "Op as long as your brother is good with you saying it ( and as you stated he jokes the same, so he is), it\u2019s no one\u2019s business.

However, the closest sibling to me is 18 years older.   All were out the house, most married with children while I was growing up.

Nobody has ever disagreed with my assessment.", "I consider myself an only child. It was just me and mum.
