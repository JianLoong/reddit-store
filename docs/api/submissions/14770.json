She said she feels sorry for my brother and can\u2019t believe how easy I find it to disregard him as well as a bunch of stuff that boils down to me being self serving and not being worthy of a place in my own family\n\nI didn\u2019t intend what I said to disinherit my brother, was I TA?", "created_utc": 1681464769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lr89h/aita_for_referring_to_myself_as_an_only_child/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad had a daughter with his first wife, she's 10 years older than me and grew up living with her mom.

So yeah, NTA.", "I was adopted and my sibling is twice my age. We never lived in the same house together and we don't have the same parents. I love my sibling to death but for all intents and purposes, I am an only child. NTA", "NTA, she is projecting stuff onto your relationship. You have a younger sibling now, but you grew up as a single child - you were 20 when your cousin was put under your parent's care. So none of what you said is wrong - you didn't have to share stuff when you were child, you didn't have the experiences people have with siblings taking/pushing the blame to one another for example.. You did grow up an only child. NTA.", "NTA. Her own issues with her adoption are her problem. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate your relationship with others. Clearly you care and love your brother/cousin. And you\u2019re very correct that there\u2019s a difference between siblings raised in the same house at the same time and siblings raised in the same house during separate time periods. You were raised as an only child which makes sense during the context of your conversation you were having", "NTA, in the psychology of child order, the way you were brought up is what impacts your personality, and you were absolutely brought up an only with that massive age gap.  Rue is projecting her own issues very intensely and had no place to say all that AH stuff to you.", "NTA. You did grow up as an only child. Someone else's experience does not change that. She needs to calm down and stop looking for problems where there aren't any.", "NTA.\n\nyou grow up as an old child so you be having only child syndrome, rue is reading way to much in to something and making the comment bigger then what is originally was.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t know you, she doesn\u2019t know the relationship you have with your cousin, she should mind her own business.", "NTA. You did grow up without siblings. You have a sibling now, but didn't until you were grown. It sounds like they may just be overly sensitive to the subject.", "NTA - you were raised an only child. The rest of her complaint is her own baggage spilling all over the place. Messy. She can judge you all she wants, what difference does it make to your life?   Certainly it doesn't change a thing about how you feel about your brother or  your family - not that as a person who is barely an acquaintance ofyours is in any way qualified to judge you...", "NTA.

While they are my step siblings and I call them my step siblings, I still classify myself as an only child.

Where I am there is a difference between adopting someone and being their legal guardian, the two are not one in the same.", "NTA\n\nRue is a psycho with some serious unresolved issues.\n\nYou were raised as an only child. There are a lot of people who were raised solo, and then through a parental remarriage gets a new sibling when they are fledged adults.

Take care of yourself, (you) (caring emoji)\n\nIt's important that her talk track is shut down post haste.

As an only child myself (literally), I don't get what her being adopted has to do with it? Plus you are an only child so you had a right to join in on the joke as far as that's concerned. But either way, it's just a joke regardless if you are an only child or not. I wouldn't have cared.", "NTA. Although, it sounds like Rue needs to see a therapist. Probably.", "NTA, you would have the same \"grew up as an only child\" syndrome if your parents had a late surprise baby just as you were moving out.", "NTA. This chick was projecting super hard.", "NTA. Rue has her own issues (not at all uncommon in adopted people), and while I get where she\u2019s coming from, you absolutely were an only child for the sake of that conversation.", "NTA the issues is that you and your brother have a massive age gap and never lived together as children.  You grew up as an only child until the age of 20. \n\nThe adoption thing is irrelevant to the story. Your situation would have been the same if your parents had a surprise baby when you were an adult.", "NTA, Rue\u2019s being a jerk. She is deciding to take offense at something that has nothing to do with her.", "NTA, each family has a different way to contextualise those relationships.", "Why does this person even have your number?

My full siblings are much younger than me and we all agree I grew up for 10 years as an only child. And there is no adoption etc involved!", "NTA. I\u2019ve been an only, an oldest, and a youngest, depending on who I was living with. I\u2019m not devaluing the lives experiences of others, just living my own. And this sib of yours essentially moved in when you were already an adult. You grew up as an only.", "NTA\n\nHer personal issues aren't yours.  She's projecting. Be careful of her in the future.", "NTA\n\nthe premise of the joke was in reference to psychological features specific to being an only child.\n\nI have 4 step siblings who I never lived with and a half brother that's 20 yrs junior. I moved out the year he was born (coincidental, there's no bad blood). So a very real sibling, that I perhaps don't know THAT well.\n\nFor all intents and purposes in this joke I too am a single child.", "You were RAISED an only child, you aren't an only child anymore. It would be the same regardless of whether your brother was adopted or born into the age gap. Your friend definitely has a trauma wound that was projected on your situation.", "My cousin is about to be 31 and her brother is 3. She grew up as an only child and was raised as such because for her entire childhood, she was an only child. When he was born, she wasn't even living in her university town half the year and at home during breaks, she lived in her own flat full time. \n\nNow, her little brother is effectively an only child because he is the only child in the house and has never lived with siblings who want to share toys or decide what to play or stuff like that that make people joke about \"only child syndrome\". \n\nDoes that mean either of them doesn't regard the other as a sibling? No, but they didn't grow up together and will never live together.\n\nNTA. This person is projecting her own issues on you.", "NTA. \n\nYou grew up an only child. Period. The end. \n\nThe fact that your parents adopted a child when you were 20 means you HAVE a sibling, but it doesn\u2019t change HOW you grew up. \n\nYou never acted as though your brother was less than in any way. You simply grew up as an only child. If Rue can\u2019t understand that\u2026..then she\u2019s willingly choosing to be offended (and clearly bringing her own baggage in).", "NTA. You were an only *child*. By the time your parents had another child, you were not one. It's not about your brother being adopted; many people who have biological siblings who weren't born until they were adults (or even mid-teens) consider themselves \"only children\" too.", "My mother adopted a girl when I was 21.  I was raised an only child.  She was raised as an only child.  Yes we are sisters but we are 20 years apart.  We never lived in the same home at the same time.", "NTA. He is your cousin.", "NTA I know someone who calls herself an only child because her siblings are like 20 years older than her, and she never shared a house with other children. People use the phrase in different ways, but neither definition actually fits in your case - either literally, or in regards to upbringing.", "NTA. Perfect example of a her-problem, not a your-problem. Let it go.", "NTA. You did grow up an only child, and now you have a brother, yes, but for all intents and purposes you didn't grow up an older sibling.\n\nAll the comments here are correct. Rue is projecting her own issues on you, which is unfair. I'd send her a text to clarify the situation\u2014maybe even send her this post to check the replies\u2014and make sure to shut that down. Both you and your now brother were raised only children! This happens with blood related siblings who have a big age difference too!\n\nRue probably needs to talk to a professional regarding her own baggage, which is now spilling onto others. But you're fine, OP.", "NTA. I'm similar as my parents adopted a young child from foster care when I was in college. Obviously I care about her and consider her a part of our family, but I don't think of her as a sister- we never lived in the same house (or even the same area), I grew up very much as the only child in my household, and we don't have a \"sister\" relationship. It's not dismissing your brother or adopted children in general to say you grew up as an only child.", "NTA. Rue is projecting. You are an only child. At the end of the day, he's still your cousin. You moved out before he moved in, so you grew up without him. It's great that you were able to form a sibling like relationship given the stage of life you were at, but she needs to talk to her own family about her issues.", "NTA. I have a sister who I grew up with and as an adult, we found out we had a half brother who had lived the other side of the planet since he was a kid. We\u2019ve met him a couple of times and he\u2019s lovely, so is his family. But honestly, I don\u2019t have the same feelings towards him as I do my sister as we didn\u2019t spend any of our formative years together and I think that\u2019s the difference.", "Its not that he's adopted, its that he wasn't there for the first 20 years of your life. You clearly grew up as an only child, even if they think you should not consider yourself one now. NTA", "NTA. She's projecting her insecurities. Don't let it bring you down.", "NTA, growing up you was an only child, as an adult you then had a brother. Simple", "NTA.\nI\u2019m an adoptee. She clearly has a different perspective about adoption but she should know that it doesn\u2019t apply to your situation. \n\nIf you want to reply, you can tell her that your family dynamics are personal and aren\u2019t up to judgment. Say that you aren\u2019t discrediting or invalidating her views as an adoptee, but it is wrong for her to project them into your family. \n\nYou grew up an only child. You didn\u2019t disinherit your brother (who also isn\u2019t technically your brother).", "NTA. He's your cousin, not your sibling. Your parents are his guardians not his Foster parents. Completely different situation from Rue.", "NTA. You said you grew up an only child. Which you did.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t disregard your brother. You literally were raised as an only child. You were an adult already when your brother came into the picture.

It is your cousin, not your brother so yes you are an only child.", "Rue has it about right.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to play both sides of that fence. You have a sibling, or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t get to say you are an only child simply because of an age difference - and you surely wouldn\u2019t had this been a biological rather than adopted sibling.\n\nThe first words out of your mouth should have been a protesting explanation - \u201cmy sibling is much younger so I was a solo child at ten, but I am not an only child.\u201d\n\nYTA, and a cruel one at that.
