My brother (32M) also got recently engaged to his gf (27F) \"Sara\" of 3 years and since then my parents have been busy planning. My fianc\u00e9 and I are both of Indian descent while Sara is white this info is relevant later. In South Asian cultures the parents take over all the expenses of the wedding so our parents obviously will do the same. This weekend we all got together and my mom proposed the plan. Apparently my in laws had contacted them to congratulate them and told them we could have a joint wedding back home in India in a large fort in Jaipur (fianc\u00e9's family is from the region) which would be a week long event. Day 1, brothers and Sara's Sangeet, day 2 will be their mehendi, day 3 the haldi and wedding ceremony, then my Sangeet, mehendi and wedding for the next 3 days and our joint reception on the 7th last day. I loved the idea and especially since I'll be able to enjoy my brother's wedding before having my own and that it'll be less of a financial strain on my parents as my in-laws will split the expenses with them. \n\n\nWell Sara wasn't happy with the arrangement, she said she didn't like the idea of sharing her day with me when we tried to explain that she'd be the focus during the three days her wedding was happening she said it would be quickly overshadowed by my wedding. When I suggested of having my wedding first she didn't like the idea as well as I'd still have the spotlight on me as a newly wed. Finally when we asked what she wanted to do she said she wanted the wedding to herself. My parents explained that they wouldn't be able to afford a big Indian wedding like this and would only be able to do a wedding here in the states which wouldn't be as elaborate. Sara started crying and left all of us shocked.\n\n\nThe next day my brother called trying to get me to convince our parents to have a separate wedding for him and Sara and I told him I wouldn't be doing that. He knew my in laws could easily pay for mine and fiance's wedding but our parents can't afford two separate weddings like that. I told him Sara was acting entitled and he got angry with me and hung up. My parents agree with me while brother is flip flopping on the situation, he's upset with us and the other hand had a big fight with Sara for not compromising or agreeing to a smaller wedding but she's adamant on having \"The big Indian wedding\". Even her parents have gotten involved telling my parents off for forcing their daughter to share her day with me. \n\nSo I ask you Reddit, am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1668020447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqs3tt/aita_for_saying_my_future_sil_is_entitled_for/", "score": 315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The grooms parents can't afford it as well. \n\nSo the compromise is she gets her big Desi wedding first and then the Op gets hers, the shared facility and expense makes that plan affordable for all parties. \n\nThe fsil doesn't want the typical \"white wedding\" what she wants is her way.", "Yep.\n\nYou want a wedding that's typically paid for by BOTH sets of parents? Then you get the wedding dictated by the budget of BOTH sets of parents. OP's parents have a budget they can spend. OP's in-laws have made an insanely generous offer. If miss entitled wants to turn down that generous offer, then she gets what her in-laws can afford. Her parents can make up the difference. \n\nI believe the phrase is \"Put up or shut up\"?", "That didn't really answer the question on if you think your parents would have offered. It seems strange your in laws would have any right to make a suggestion like that for someone else's wedding.", "She\u2019s got 3 whole days that are all about her, what more does she want? If she got married in the states, it would be one day and done. She should be grateful that the wedding is being paid for at all. She\u2019s acting like a brat. I get that she wants a separate wedding but she can\u2019t expect it to all be paid for and have you, their actual daughter to be ignored. That\u2019s not fair. \n\nYou guys were engaged first, and your wedding was being planned first. If anyone should get it, it should be you guys. Can they not wait to get married and save some money so she can have her big day all of her own?", "Because it\u2019s easy to spend someone else\u2019s money.", "The fact that they can't contribute isn't your problem. If Sara and her parents can't afford it, they can get married in a registrar's and then have a meal for immediate family only.", "Wait. *Sara's own parents* aren't even contributing to her wedding but are giving you grief for basically doing the same? Wild.", "All that but without you there . That's what she wants.", "It sounds like she wants it to be about me me me me meeee... bridezilla alert.", "maybe she doesnt want you there, so all eyes on her? lol. but IMO, whether you go first or they go first, she will have a lot of attention on her since she's a non-Indian marrying into an Indian family.", "Exactly. She specifically said in the post that Sara wants a big Indian wedding. SHE WANTS THE WHOLE WEEK TO HERSELF. OP is willing to let her have 3 whole days to herself when most weddings in the states are 1 day! OP is even willing to let Sara go first. What an entitled B. If the parents said they can't afford it that means brother and Sara need to figure it out.  Future SIL is making a terrible impression too.\n\nSometimes I really can't believe the stuff I read on Reddit. This is unreal.", "Tell her to pay for her. Your parents response to her parents:\n\n\u201cIf you want another wedding for your daughter, pay for it.\u201d\n\nAlso, have your parents limit this part of the culture for your brother. I am Indian and my husband is America. We are paid for our own wedding. My parents tried to pay but if we wanted it our way, we knew we had to pay for her. If Sara and her parents want a separate one, they can pay for it. End of story.", "So I\u2019m actually Punjabi as well - genuinely most of these commenters don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about and I\u2019m frankly appalled. I\u2019m sorry but this entire setup prioritizes you and your fianc\u00e9 significantly. And you ignoring that is pretty messed up.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is apparently pretty wealthy and from Jaipur. You absolutely realize that there\u2019s no way in hell that everyone invited by your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family for your wedding is going to be attending their functions too. It\u2019s going to be a party for you and your fianc\u00e9 and sarah and your brother will not be prioritized by anyone. And a good portion of the people in attendance are going to be your and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family members, she\u2019s going to have just a few people there at most. You know that they\u2019re getting the short end of the stick. Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents shouldn\u2019t have made the suggestion and then it was basically treated like a done deal.  Your first thought was how nice that setup was for you. \n\nIndian weddings especially Punjabi weddings are about connecting and melding a family. Your family is telling your brother and Sara they\u2019re not that important and that you are. We\u2019ve had a lot of interracial and interfaith weddings in my family - in every single one the sharing of cultural traditions and the non Punjabi half of the couple being fully welcomed and respected/ treated as part of the family has been so meaningful. My teeny little cousins bonding with cousins\u2019s wife\u2019s cousins / niblings by the Indians helping the Jewish ones tie patka, parnas, or wear a chunni while they brought and helped our side out on yarmulkes- that\u2019s the kind moments that make Indian weddings. You\u2019re all telling Sarah and your brother they just get everyone going through the motions.\n\nThe wedding your parents would throw in the states too - like are they going to bother even trying to make sure Sarah and your brother get all the functions? Frankly it doesn\u2019t sound like it. Ever think Sarah also wants the big wedding because it matters to your brother and she cares about your family wanting her to belong? Because you\u2019re dragging her when in reality she\u2019s getting no say in anything and she\u2019s absolutely not going to get to have a wedding that\u2019s about her and your brother. \n\nAlso this is going to cause so much vicious gossip and aunties will be bringing it up for the rest of Sarah\u2019s life. Do you even give a crap about your brother ? Or his wife and future family? It sure as hell sounds like you don\u2019t. Like I sent this this to my cousins WhatsApp group and everyone is incredulous and saying they wouldn\u2019t even be this unthinking rude and uncaring to someone they disliked. Much less someone they considered family.", "Why would she believe she's entitled to your *in-laws* money? They'll have to pay for it if it's going to be in Jaipur, right?

The wedding that OP's parents can't afford without the OP's in-laws. Meaning she wants OP's in-laws, who are not related to SIL at all, to pay for her wedding. In what culture does that make sense? That the epitome of entitlement.", "Sure, but her expectations are not going to fly. The parents can\u2019t afford it so she needs to pay for it herself or change her expectations", "I agree with this, maybe I misunderstood. Sara is not entitled to two weddings financed by OP's family, but she does not have to agree to the combined wedding.", "Oh I agree with this. I think I misunderstood. I will change my judgement. I thought you were encouraging her to accept the Jaipur wedding over a smaller wedding.", "So she wants your  in-laws' money? That aren't related to her whatsoever?", "As someone that\u2019s actually Punjabi I promise you op\u2019s future in laws are NOT being generous\u2026at all. The opposite. They\u2019re being showy on purpose. They\u2019re signaling distaste and a lack of respect for op\u2019s future SIL and brother and are going to expect / invite their friends and family to Sarah and op\u2019s brother\u2019s functions and they\u2019ll be making sure that their child and op\u2019s events are better. Frankly there\u2019s no way to read this as generous - we Punjabis absolutely see weddings as about melding culture and families - you aren\u2019t just attending a union between two individuals but two extended family units . They\u2019re snubbing op\u2018a brother and his future wife - especially Sarah knowing her family and friends have no connection to Jaipur and there will be none of that sort of connection building that\u2019s the point of these weddings . Fuck who is even going to be stealing brotherNs shoes ? I bet fianc\u00e9\u2019s family takes that over too. \n\nOp\u2019s parents are willing to spend lavishly on op. They\u2019re going to do it happily and proudly no matter what. They are offering crumbs for their other kid at best and telling him his marriage doesn\u2019t matter and isn\u2019t important like op\u2019s. They\u2019re showing that they don\u2019t care for Sarah. They should at least put an equal amount of money towards each kid\u2019s wedding. They\u2019re blowing the budget and going over the top for op and say brother and Sarah get a consolation half wedding or have to be a sideshow for op and her fianc\u00e9. This would actually be more expensive for them because if they\u2019re following tradition - they should also be paying for all of Sarah\u2019s close families\u2019 flights, lodging and gifting her siblings and parents at least one outfit each at a minimum. If they want to throw it in India and something thus lavish and want all the functions - that\u2019s like bare minimum levels of what you have to do as parents of a child marrying someone that\u2019s not from the country or culture.", "They could've afforded two simpler wedding in our local state but they aren't able to afford two destination weddings even with my in-laws paying half.

So the in-laws are doing the lavish spending, not the parents.", "That's even worse. It's not even your SIL who is being entitled to your parents money but her parents. Just so gross. Honestly this isn't your problem to deal with. You have been gracious enough to say you are ok with sharing your wedding with her and your brother. The rest is on your parents. I suggest showing them this thread. They need to state their boundaries and put the ball back in your brother and SILs court. If she doesn't want a joint wedding then that's fine but your parents won't be paying for it. She wants traditional then her parents can front the money for a big Indian wedding.", "That\u2019s what I meant. If they\u2019ve only recently become engaged, can\u2019t they wait a few years and save up? Why do you parents have to choose between their biological child and their future DIL?

With your parents and in laws essentially footing the bill and you and your fiance' are being gracious enough to share with them.\n\nI bet if you put it in terms like that, your brother will come around.\n\nIf Sara is so set on having her day separate and her way, she and your brother will need to save on their own and pay for a separate wedding.

This sounds like a money pit that is only going to get deeper.", "Isn't it the culture that the bride's family pays for the wedding?", "I wouldn\u2019t even think she\u2019s entitled tbh - brown kids that grow up in the west absolutely hype up Indian weddings and it can be a really both meaningful and fun way for us to connect with our culture in a completely unbridled way that\u2019s hard sometimes otherwise. Like they\u2019re experienced of pure joy and belonging and inclusiveness. Friends family everyone. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if brother had hyped up how important the cultural and connection aspects are for him and how he was excited to have her become a part of his family in that way and experience it too. Op as his sister would have a lot of meaningful roles and responsibilities in her brothers wedding and would have some sweet welcoming tasks towards her SIL.  Basically saying that her marriage isn\u2019t worth the full / actual hooplah would hurt at a personal level and because she cares about her fianc\u00e9. Op just immediately trying to make her seem like some crazed brat is so disingenuous. Sure maybe she is and op has a lot of reason to feel that way. It\u2019s just not been expressed based on op\u2019s description", "That is insane! Once they say they can't afford to do both, Sara should end that conversation. I say your parents issue an ultimatum. Either you do it jointly with each of you getting your 3 days or they'll give the money that they would've spent (if she wasn't a selfish, entitled B) and they can have whatever type of wedding they want in the States. And then say they will not be discussing it further. I really don't like Sara LOL", "Oh abesolutely NTA. She sounds horribly entitled", "There\u2019s definitely a reason op is bringing this here and not asking her other Punjabi or south Asian friends instead!", "It was their idea / suggestion which was already rude and bonkers especially since they don\u2019t have a close connection to Sarah or the brother yet. But op\u2019s parents enthusiastically agreed and committed all the funds, minus a pittance, to op and the lavish wedding her future in laws want. Op in her comments has said that her parents could\u2019ve afforded two medium sized weddings - one for each kid - but it wouldn\u2019t be a huge affair in Jaipur and would likely both have been in the states. She mentioned that they figured the bigger party was a better use of the funds. \n\nPlus  her in laws actually could cover it themselves . If there\u2019s a wealth disparity especially if you\u2019re having it at the location where the richer family lives, it\u2019s very common / almost the norm nowadays for the wealthier family to shoulder a bigger burden. That\u2019s in part since they\u2019re likely going to WANT to spend more and cater to their local friends and family too in a way that out of town family isn\u2019t as invested in.", "I\u2019m Punjabi and no Sarah is not being entitled nor is her family. The tradition is both the couples parents split the cost nowadays - it\u2019s not just the bride that pays . It isn\u2019t 1923. Op\u2019s parents want to just blow the money they\u2019ve saved for BOTH kid\u2019s weddings where they\u2019d be covering roughly half (though when l family\u2019s from different areas or places the local one will cover more usually as will the family with wealth to spare) and just give it all to op. Brother gets to be a sideshow at best as a courtesy or he can have scraps. It\u2019s like they saved 50 bucks and each  kid should get 25 and in most families the richer Jaipur based family would cover a bit more (it\u2019s not destination for them it\u2019s home) and most Punjabi parents today will also consider that their kid is marrying someone whose not from the culture and want their kid to still experience Punjabi weddings so they\u2019d probably split it more like 20 to op and 30 to brother. \n\nHere the in laws expressed wanting something very extravagant and op\u2019s parents said all 50 to op and brother and Sarah get tacked on or maybe they\u2019ll scrounge for change under the couch cushion instead. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason op is asking aita about this and not a desi / Punjabi subreddit or her brown friends. Because we know this is just super shitty", "This just is completely the wrong take and shows a total lack of understanding of Punjabi culture and weddings . Sarah and op\u2019s brother are being shafted and treated pretty horribly.", "Ah, I see. Thanks for breaking it down for me!", "Yta- you have had multiple people from your culture come on here and tell you so.

If she want \"attention\" she need to get married where her family is. Why should anyone else shoulder the burden of her big destination wedding?  That's extreme level of entitlement.   \n\nLess or more relative in the hall doesn't really matter, when a bride walk up to that stage and say I do, she is the center of attention of everyone in the hall.   Our people love looking at the bride.  Just because Sarah won't have her entire clan there, doesn't mean people will not look at her with interest, or talk to her, or be happy for her. Our culture is known for hospitality and generosity, specially toward foreigners. \n\nParents and family offered something out of goodness of their heart, as combined weddings are a norm in our desi culture.

Halfway through the reception she looked at me and said she was ready to die. Her dress weighed a ton, her hair and arms were laden and dragging on her, she could never just stop and eat properly, she always had to be perfect and poised and ready to be gracious and sociable, and sometimes she was holding her pee in for several hours at a time. I have never seen someone look so deeply exhausted. I was trying my hardest to get her food and drink and rest but Auntie's are gonna Aunty. \nLet Sara go first.

I've helped plan my cousins weddings in India and in US and things are just way cheaper in India. The amount of $ that goes into having a lavish do in India would translate into a small wedding in US. The way you are explaining, for them to cater to Sarah's family similarly, they can't do that in India. \nAlso, in India, one day is paid by the brides family and the next day is paid by the groom's family.

The joint wedding is being financed by OP\u2019s parents and OP\u2019s in laws. Sarah\u2019s parents aren\u2019t giving a dime for the big Indian wedding. If she wants a big Indian wedding all to herself , then her parents and her husband\u2019s parents should both pay. Sarah doesn\u2019t want her parents to pay. She wants OP\u2019s folks to cough up the entire amount for a separate wedding.", "Your in laws created this mess by saying that they would finance a double wedding in Jaipur. Why did they do that ? They have no relationship to Sarah and they seem to want the spotlight taken away from Their son by having a double wedding. I can understand it if your parents suggested it but why would your in laws do this ? Your in laws are even doing 75 percent. What kind of madness is this that they \u201csuggested\u201d a double wedding that they pay for for some white woman they don\u2019t even know ? Really wierd.", "Do you mean because they asked them to share the day? Genuine question. All my answers are based off the fact that the son and Sarah have only just got engaged whereas OP has been engaged for a while as was already set to be married next year.", "Lmao I also whatsapped my cousins this post and literally same to same ! The worst take was people shutting on Sarah for her cultural differences not entitling her to any of this and that she\u2019s culturally unaware\u2026while they confidently insert their own culture onto this whole situation and judge based on those standards. Op wants to seem super Indian and shit and wants the full socialite treatment for her wedding without any concern about etiquette or tradition. She just wants people to tell her she shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it and that she\u2019s not the one in the wrong\u2026when literally the only ones that aren\u2019t acting awfully are Sarah and brother !!", "Yeah that\u2019s not what op said and that\u2019s not how they\u2019re splitting it. But I\u2019ve also planned weddings in both places (Jaipur, Chandigarh, Delhi, and goa and nyc, la, nj, and a couple others) and  yeah the us ones are a lot cheaper. You\u2019re underestimating the extravagance and size of the Jaipur vs modest us one. \n\nOp\u2019s parents per op\u2019s own comments could have funded a perfectly fine medium sized wedding for each kid in the us. The in laws wanted fancy and big and in India. They decided to rearrange the funds so they use almost all of it for the Jaipur wedding. And despite that the in laws were able / seemingly willing to cover more of the costs because they want to be throwing a huge bash and are local - so it\u2019ll be their friends and family more than anyone else . \n\nThere are also norms and etiquette that surround how you handle when sides have different amounts of wealth and where there\u2019s a couple from different culture / nationalities. And when a wedding is destination for only one side of the family (here it\u2019s local for op\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s family only). I would actually say it\u2019s more common to have the family cover their own functions\nthough (each pays to throw own sangeet, boys side throws small mehendi for their side, girls throw bigger one for theirs, Anand karaj and reception is split) than the one to one day by day you describe. \n\nFinally it\u2019s not catering to Sarah\u2019s family . Like Punjabi weddings are about extended family connections and memory. Not having them involved or caring about her and brothers experience and ability to enjoy these traditions and functions is really crappy. The parents are making an active choice here to prioritize a bigger party and one couple over the other and basically don\u2019t really care how that makes their son and DIL feel", "I don\u2019t understand why your in laws initiated a double\nWedding and involved her in the first place. Looks like they went asking for trouble.", "I don't get the attention thing either literally everyone wears the same shade of color as the bride and it's actually preferred that way. No one is confused who the bride is and everyone has fun.", "Yeah that\u2019s not really relevant. But I\u2019m not sure your understanding is accurate-that op and her fianc\u00e9  knew their timeframe already doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve actually been engaged for a while. Both engagements may have been recent and Sarah and brother may have actually been dating longer anyway. Op hasn\u2019t said. The plan to have op\u2019s wedding in Jaipur was initiated by her future in laws when they called to congratulate op\u2019s parents on their son and Sarah getting officially engaged.\n\nPunjabi weddings aren\u2019t a single day. They\u2019re not even just the actual named functions which op\u2019s family wants to split over 3 days - there are also tons of informals and other practices and things like gift, nuts, fruits and sweets exchanges . Western weddings are usually more about celebrating a couple and their love and people coming together to celebrate and witness that. Punjabi weddings are more about the melding of two extended family and friend groups and celebrating the connection between the couple but also everyone that loves the couple because they\u2019re all family now. A lot of the traditions are about different folks connecting like the grooms shoes get stolen by the brides sisters and cousin sisters while his side tries to stop the stealing and then the groom \u201cbribes\u201d the sisters to get them back . Or ceremonies where the grooms female relatives go to their soon to be sister and adorn her with jewelry and flowers. \n\nSarah and brother being Thrown in (something  that the parents just decided and informed them without even asking if there was interest - and not even considering that that means Sarah\u2019s family is likely not included or involved much ), op likes it because it\u2019s convenient for her and easy. And the majority of the guests are going to be those that op\u2019s in laws invite - since they\u2019re organizing it and are local. None of them have any connection to Sarah and they only are connected to brother because op. \n\nOp\u2019s parents per op could afford medium sized weddings in the states for both kids - they instead chose to take the funds that would\u2019ve been split between each kid and just put it all towards this huge bash for op\u2019s wedding and leaving Sarah and their son to choose between the parents helping organize a mini pity party or being the side show at op\u2019s wedding week extravaganza where most attendees will have no connection or interest in the couple and only show up because they know the hosts and are going to be more focused on op\u2019s nuptials that are about to happen or just did happen. \n\nIt\u2019s not even about the money. It\u2019s that they truly don\u2019t care about Sarah being welcomed into the family or sharing the experience with her.

Yes, obviously getting a bunch of Americans to Jaipur isn't going to be that feasible, so Sara's guest count will be smaller than brothers. But like, isn't that kind of the deal when you have a wedding outside your country? I don't get why that's In-law's fault. And since OPs family and future in-laws family are friends, I'm assuming a decent overlap in guests for brother's wedding and OPs wedding, but I would assume anyone invited to both would know the parties well enough to be excited about both.\n\nYes, it makes sense that most of OP's future in-laws guest list would be huge and mostly interested in the 3 days of OP/in-law wedding. But, as a westerner, that's why I'm confused. If I were Sara, I wouldn't expect people not connected with my partner or I to come to my 3 days.

Sara also has parents, and if she wants to follow the culture and wants to have a big Indian wedding to keep her spotlight on her, then she can and her parents can pay for it.

But if Sara wants to go all out, she should be ready to foot the bill and not expect OP's in-laws to pay for her wedding. That is totally ridiculous by any culture.", "Thank you for taking the time and elaborate on the cultural background behind this \u201egenerous offer\u201c. I read your comments (and of other Punjabis) and it\u2019s extremely interesting. \nI got a weird feeling why the inlaws would offer this and if they would really treat both weddings equally and your explanations really put the uneasy feelings into context. Take my free daily award! (Hence the wholesome award, although it doesn\u2019t fit the topic).\n\nI\u2019m wondering if OP defends the inlaws on purpose or if she (and her parents?) are really oblivious due to being part of the diaspora community.", "OP should post in r/TwoXIndia for responses from south asians who actually understand the nuance. \n\nHowever, as another punjabi, I don't see how her parents are slighting her brother at all. Indian weddings are always showy especially North Indian ones, but renting out a fort for a whole week for all the guests is a major expense that is being spared on Sarah, however if she doesn't want it then there's no reason to do it like that. \n\nAs per our culture, Sarah's parents can throw her the wedding that she wants and Op's parents don't have to pay a cent except reception. \n\nESH because it might be a snub, sarah for looking a gift horse in the mouth and being entitled, OP for not even looking at things from someone (esp a non-desi's) perspective.", "Yes, this post explained some, but not all nuances.", "There's an Indian person who basically asked instead of shitting on OP give some answers on what they could do instead. You ignored them tho you've been jumping in everywhere else. What do you think she should do. Remember there's 3 families here all with different amounts that they can put in. Saras family are putting in nothing."]}
