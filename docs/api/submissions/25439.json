How long are you going to live off of your dad.  At $65k you should be able to afford your own apartment.", "YTA", "Your dad wants young adult support, not child support. He needs to put a roof over everyone\u2019s head and food on the table. As an adult you are old enough to contribute instead of getting a free ride. YTA", "YTA \n\nIts not unreasonable to ask a 23 year old adult who still lives at home for rent. You are working and making good money. The fact he's lost child support money is irrelevant. \n\n>I'm trying to save money for my own place and not live off other people so why is he trying to live off me?\n\nYou are literally living off him when you are in his home, eating his food, using his electricity and water all whilst squirrelling away your own money for yourself. \n\nEither contribute or move out.", "YTA or you could see it as him having used child support to support you 400 a month barely covers your food. Pay him or move out", "Yta.  Call it child support, call it rent, call it \u201cfrindle\u201d (Iykyk) whatever you call it, it\u2019s you paying to live in his home as an adult.  Get over yourself.  Or better yet, go find a place that you can rent cheaper,  I\u2019ll wait..", "YTA. You're a grown man, pay your rent.", "YTA\nI mean, you are living in his house for free. So he is perfectly in his rights to ask for rent. You're 23 so...its time to grow up. It doesn't matter what he wants to use it for. I don't know which state you live in but rent anywhere for even a studio apartment is at least $800. So, you're still getting off cheap.", "YTA. When older generations talk about the entitled and selfish young people, they are talking about you.", "Fuck around and find out. YTA.", "YTA. You have been living there for free because apparently he could afford that. He did you a favor.  Things have changed and he can now no longer afford you living with him for free, so you will have to pitch in. You are an adult with a decent job. Take some responsibility! How dare you ask him to get a second job to pay for you living there! Good luck trying to find your own space for 400 a month.", "YTA.  You are an adult.  Adults pay rent.  $400 is cheaper than you're going to find in most other places.", "YTA in a big way. Your dad is asking for rent. You said yourself you are working and living in HIS house. Stop trying to disguise your greedy self as him trying to claim child support. \n\nYou asked this forum if you were TA. The answer is largely YES. So what are you going to do about it?", "YTA- You make 65k and don\u2019t want to pay $400 to live in your fathers house?! Either pay it or move out. You\u2019re not entitled to live rent free.", "YTA. You are an adult, right? Why wouldn\u2019t it make sense for you to pay rent? You should realize that your father is basically covering your support since you live off him. You are over 18, he doesn\u2019t have to let you live there. You are mooching off him and complaining about having to pay rent.", "Dude it\u2019s $400, you\u2019ll never find a place that rents that low. Also do you pay for your utilities? If not then that\u2019s an even better deal. Just pay the rent, you\u2019ll still be left with 60k+.", "YTA.\n\nYou are earning 65k at year, you need to pay rent or move out as any adults. Most people that earn minimum wage do still give some money to their parents when they are adults living at home.", "You're 23, making 65k a year, and you can't pay a measly $400 a month? Talk about entitled. So being a freeloader. YTA.", "NAH I think your dad has responsibility to his other kids and if he NEEDS that 400 a month to be able to look after the younger ones, there's no harm in asking you. You are also reasonable for stating that you will be living with him longer if you're saving 400 less per month, which benefits neither of you. He should be chasing up with the courts as his next step to get the money he is owed and ensure he has the capacity to care for his kids. That isn't your responsibility. \n\nThat being said, it may actually be a good idea for you to pay some 'rent' to your dad. If you are planning on getting a house with a mortgage, they will likely want some proof that you have been able to keep up with consistent (monthly) payments for a certain amount of time so they can see evidence that you will be able to keep up with mortgage payments. Just a lump sum of money doesn't necessarily mean that you will be able to do so. \n\nI'm in the same situation, 22, just moved home after uni to save for a place and was given this advice by a gov. worker so definitely consider it. It doesn't have to be much, but some kind of proof will be helpful when you make the next step.", "YTA. You sound EXTREMELY entitled. Your attitude about this is ridiculous - he has every right to ask you for rent and you have no right to interrogate or demand how he uses that money.\n\n$400 is quite generous for room and board and I\u2019m guessing you get plenty of other perks living with family (utilities, groceries, meals, etc.)\n\nShed your indignant attitude about this ASAP. 23 is way too old to be an entitled brat of this magnitude.", "YTA - doesn't matter what he plans on using the money for, you're 23. It's perfectly reasonable for you to start paying rent.", "YTA. You\u2019re looking at this like \u201cmy dad is making me make up for child support\u201d and that\u2019s an incorrect view.\n\nYou moved back home and live rent free with your father. He was fine for you to do this originally because he thought he could afford it. Now, without the additional child support money, he cannot afford it. He can\u2019t afford to look after 3 minors AND allow his adult child to live at home rent free. So he\u2019s asking you to contribute to the household.\n\nIf you pay it, it will be \u201crent\u201d because it comes from you: an adult living in a house that you don\u2019t own. If it came from your brothers\u2019 mom, it would be \u201cchild support\u201d because it is money paid by a non-custodial parent for the upkeep of a child.\n\nHe would be within his rights to ask you for this money even if he was still receiving child support. It was his choice to allow you to live on the home rent free. Regardless of your relationship or what obligation he owes you morally, legally you\u2019re an adult with no stake in the house, and no lease - you staying there is mainly at his discretion. \n\nYou\u2019re fixated on the idea that he\u2019s asked you for the same amount as he gets in child support and hence blind to the actual point: you are an adult with a decent job and hence in a position to financially contribute to the household in which you live, so you should do so. \n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to do that here, you could seek a different living situation. My understanding, however, is the amount you\u2019re being asked for is a lot less than you\u2019d have to pay in actual rental situation", "YTA. Pay up or leave. Such a c*^t!!!!", "YTA. $400 a month is peanuts compared to what you\u2019d pay in rent somewhere else. You\u2019ve been living there for free this whole time, I don\u2019t think him asking you to contribute is unreasonable.", "YTA you should be paying rent at your age. It\u2019s very gracious your dad didn\u2019t ask sooner. It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s asking it now and it mimics the child support, you should have been paying it anyway.", "But you are living off other people because you're living off of your dad! He could obviously afford to have you leeching off him when he had child support but now he hasn't got that coming in, needs you, as an adult to pull your own weight so he can look after the kids that actually need support! YTA, stop expecting a free ride and pay your way in the world and grow the f*ck up", "YTA - circumstances are different now - rent here will still be cheaper than being out on your own", "Why the heck would you still live at home with 65k. You earn more than double than I do and I live alone. Pay rent to your dad, dude, 400 bucks is not much for what you are earning.", "Asking for rent IS the financial help????", "I'm assuming he gives his dad a rolls Royce every day but let's face it, there is no evidence to support this either. \nWho hurt you so bad you have to call strangers names?", "So you have your own electricity and water bill and your own internet provider?", "Except you appear to be an adult living rent free and shitting on your family.", "You're taking up space.  Space that could be put to better use, like a pile of dog crap.", "Er no\nI live with my parents and I give money to help with bills and food\n\nIt's called being an adult", "Its also not your house. YTA. YTA. YTA.", "It\u2019ll become your problem when dad will ask you to leave cuz he can\u2019t afford you staying there and could instead rent the room. You\u2019ll discover that an apartment costs way more than $300. Your dad doesn\u2019t have to subsidize your future downpayment, it was nice while he could afford it but things have changed. YTA, pay rent or get out", "He may be 'a grown man', but he's no adult. YTA", "I guess vegen only eat air then\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Time to move out and see what real life really costs", "Sorry, OP, but you obviously have no idea how adult life and BILLS work. With another body in the house, that means grocery bill goes up, water bill goes up, electric bill goes up. Outside of that, the need to clean more frequently goes up, too. \n\nYou are 23 with a good salary and live at home - you should have been paying rent anyway. Your dad was nice enough to not charge you anything when he could cover everything on his own (even though he didn\u2019t have to). Now, his circumstances have changed, so yours have changed too. Either pay him the $400 he\u2019s asking for in rent or move out. And please know that paying rent to family will be pay cheaper than renting from someone else. $400/month is a sweet deal, so you should take it while you can. Otherwise, no offense, but I hope your dad kicks you out to help alleviate his financial burden.", "One word of advice. *Move.* YTA", "He\u2019s vegan, apparently they don\u2019t use electricity!!"]}
