I've known it to some extent since I was around 12 or 13, but due to living in a pretty conservative area and having a religious family, I've kept in on the down low. I've always dreamed of coming out but it's just not realistic for me right now. \n\nI started college this fall in a much more urban, liberal area. My roommate, Rachel is straight but a strong ally and very open about it. We're not super close, but whatever. I'm just there to do homework and sleep. Rachel has a good friend Kayla who is a lesbian, but I didn't know her super well before this night. \n\nRachel and Kayla go out to parties every weekend, two weekends ago, they invited me to come. I had just finished a big exam and thought it might be a good way to have some fun, even if it's something I don't normally do. I'm not a big drinker, but when I occasionally do, I get kind of crazy. This time, Kayla and I were both pretty drunk and, long story short, we ended up making out. I had never kissed a girl before this. I have limited memory of the night, but it made me realize that I'm very very attracted to Kayla and I'm really excited to express my sexuality in a way I have never had the chance to at home. But I was also stricken with fear, as I am very much still closeted and don't feel ready to come out.\n\nToday, when I got back to school from thanksgiving, Rachel wouldn't talk to me. We aren't super great friends so at first I thought she was just upset to be back at college or maybe hungover, but I soon found out that she was upset upon finding out that I made out with Kayla. I don't know how she found out, but she was angry that she had been roommates with a lesbian for 3 months and didn't know. I guess it makes her uncomfortable to be changing and sleeping in the presence of someone who might be attracted to her (which I very much am not). \n\nI've never made any kind of sexual advance or even any comment that might hint that I am a lesbian. I stay in my lane, and she stays in hers, for the most part. In this moment, I was mainly just fearful that my secret was out to someone who I didn't want to know. \n\nI called her a fucking asshole and said she was being unreasonable... but now that I'm thinking about it, I'm starting to think that I overreacted. I know what it feels like as a girl to be really on guard to sexual advances and harassment and I'm afraid that I might have made her super uncomfortable. I'm trying to decide if I'm in the wrong here, in which case I will apologize, but I don't want to be walked all over if I'm in the right. \n\nI've never been confident in my sexuality, being raised how I was, and I feel that I was just starting to gain the confidence to explore it a little more, but this just made me feel awful. Was it my responsibility to come out to her when we became roommates?", "created_utc": 1701140260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185lsj0/aita_for_not_telling_my_roommate_that_im_a_lesbian/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like what kind of self control do you have that you can\u2019t live the gender you are attracted to. Also there are lots of people sharing with women and men, gay and straight. I\u2019ve never heard about these dramas before. You must either be super backward or come from an extremely backward place or both", "There is no such thing a \u201cperfectly legitimate discrimination.\u201d", "If you're sexually attracted to someone's sex, you're the bad guy if you don't draw the line at them changing in front of you. If you disagree, you're a bad person.", "So your proposed solution is that OP explain that it's not an issue because the roommate who is offended isn't at all attractive?", "There\u2019s only really one person freaking out about the getting naked thing - they\u2019ve just replied to almost every single person with basically the same comment so it looks like a lot of people are worried about this. But to answer your question, it\u2019s not totally unrealistic to think roommates have changed in front of each other at this point in the semester. Most of the time the bathrooms in the dorms are a stall type situation and are crowded or gross, so it\u2019s either get over changing in front of your roommate, or get really good a balancing on one leg next to a toilet. Still, plenty of people figure out they\u2019re queer in college and manage to not assault their roommate so not sure it\u2019s quite the predator situation this person is imagining.", "So every gay guy who ever changed in a gym is a bad person and should have, I don't know, changed in the corridor?\n\nTf is this puritan bullshit", "Jesus, it\u2019s really pathetic that you won\u2019t give it up even when someone says they\u2019re done talking about it.", "Have a good day.", "What the actual fuck? If someone is nonchalant about undressing in front of you, you have to come out or else you're the bad guy? What kind of logic is that? No one has an obligation to come out just because someone doesn't think about whether or not the person in front of them might be attracted to their sex (and not even them in particular).\n\nComing out is a bigger \"priority\" than \"knowing whether the person I am changing in front of is attracted to my sex/gender\".\n\nWhat's next? Only talking to people who aren't attracted to your sex/gender? So if I do this, does everyone have to disclose their sexuality when I start talking to them?\n\nClearly, there is an imbalance here. Someone can easily adjust their boundaries due to lack of knowledge. If I'm not familiar enough with someone to know their sexuality, I don't undress in front of them. Easy peasy. Me having to come out because the person in front of me didn't think twice about whether or not they're comfortable with a potentially gay person being in the room when they undress is ridiculous. It's not somebody else's job to manage your boundaries and if your boundaries are contingent on knowledge about people that you just don't have, act like it instead of making it someone else's problem.\n\nAlso, in your world, it would be super easy to just bully people into coming out. Feeling comfortable enough to undress in front of the same sex? Just say \"oh I am uncomfortable undressing in front of gay people of the same sex as me. Please tell me, are you gay or bi?\" and by your logic, anyone would have to out themselves to not be a bad person, even if this was done in bad faith. Can you see how that is unreasonable to expect of someone?", "Who said that? You're the only one assuming that's what's happening here, because again, it's the only thing you can think about, the solution is to talk to the roommate why is she uncomfortable, she would tell the reason, could be homophobia or just jealousy, we don't know, you're the one making weird assumptions and making it sexual", "> Who said that?\n\nYou?\n\nNo, the reasonable assumption here is that the issue is that roommate is suddenly running through their previous interactions and realizing how many of them wouldn't have happened at all if she knew OP was a lesbian.", "I don\u2019t agree with the person you are arguing with but I do think it is an important conflict of principles to ameliorate. Why is it that it\u2019s acceptable to be uncomfortable with changing around a guy but not acceptable to be uncomfortable changing around a lesbian woman? Is the possibility of arousal not the same? Like it\u2019s equally as presumptuous to assume that a guy would be attracted to a girl. \n\nI struggle to see how it can be considered homophobic to fear your lesbian roommate\u2019s potential attraction, but not be considered sexist to fear a man\u2019s potential straight attraction."]}
