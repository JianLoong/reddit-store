That's her problem not yours.", "She should feel uncomfortable. He sounds unhinged. Definitely NTA", "NTA. Your family should have removed him. Consider hosting your family events at your house and state he is not to come.", "I would outright avoid him. If your sister's uncomfortable tough she should consider how you feel.  If there's any babysitting arrangement between the two of you I'd advise ending it though. You don't want him going nuts on your children.  He's definitely an abuser and he's trying to see if he can abuse you to. As long as you're not cussing him out, going out of your way to harm him in any way  your family needs to accept the fact that the two of you no longer speak. It's your choice who you interact with and honestly going as low contact as possible is probably the safest bet with his crazy ass.  This is not ok and anyone trying to convince you that it is needs therapy  asap.  All you're doing is ignoring him he got lucky. I bet your partner wants him dead lol", "NTA.", "Narcissism is irrelevant when this guy is violent and abusive. If your sister and parents make the choice to overlook that, it doesn\u2019t compel you to, as well. What a scary, scary man. NTA", "You\u2019re not an asshole for ignoring an abuser lmao"]}
