This is already a major overreaction. Then you said he Pushed his GF, your sister, while she tried to get him to stop. You had to leave your own child's party to calm down and feel safe and none of them think that warrants a freaking apology?????!!!  I'm so sorry your parents and sister are not supporting you.

The recent loss of your grandfather also irrelevant. Not even being pregnant at the time matters. The only thing that is relevant is that he had no right to yell at you - there are ways to communicate - he isn't trying to communicate with you - he's venting anger.

You were tired, sick of listening to all 3 children and threatened taking the bikes and scooters away to try to stop the bickering. You did not isolate his stepdaughter to undermine him. That was his interpretation only. He was purposely ranting and standing over you and your small child to be intimidating. He pushed your sister when she tried to stop him, so that he could continue ranting at you. Obviously, there is an anger management issue there.  I would want an apology too.
