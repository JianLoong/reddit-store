This came as a shock to the family since, from what we could tell, there were no issues. My brother in law is a great guy who fit into our family from the jump and someone I (25m) would still consider a friend now, even though they're separating. \n\nThe reason for their separation is that my BIL came out as gay. Apparently dude's been half in love with his best friend for years and decided it was time for him to stop running from that. In a move that I didn't think was very cool since this is something ultra personal, my sister told us that during one of their last conversations he described their marriage as just another form of the physical ways his self hatred would manifest, similar to actions he performed as a teenager. The way she said it made it sound like she expected it to make us angry, but it just made me sad. Everything she's said about the ending of their relationship and she response to it makes me sad, honestly. \n\nThis is not an anti-sister post. I feel a lot of sympathy for her having to reroute the course of her life, but this isn't like a normal divorce where someone was significantly wronged. It seems she wants us all to board the 'hate former-BIL train' and I just can't get behind that. Every time anyone tries to reason with her, she shuts them down so I mostly stopped engaging with the topic of divorce altogether.\n\nShe's been going to a therapy support group for the last few weeks but still saying she doesn't feel like she's getting the support she needs. After hearing this on repeat for a while, I finally asked her if the support she 'needs' is just a space to complain about her ex being queer without feeling judged for doing so. She got visibly angry at me and told me I \"don't understand\" and I'm \"taking his side.\"\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679598759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zu5l1/aita_for_taking_my_exbrother_in_laws_side_in_my/", "score": 1045, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She got visibly angry at me and told me I \"don't understand\" and I'm \"taking his side.\"\n\nYTA, and you are taking his side.\n\nShe was told by her partner that her marriage was a lie and a form of self-harm. That is absolutely devastating and, regardless of your BIL's reasoning for doing so, makes him an asshole. Your response to this is to passive aggressively call her a bigot. Just because he's gay does not mean the problem is \"your sister hates gay people.\"\n\nE: To be absolutely clear, you don't have to hate the BIL, but you absolutely shouldn't be defending him and you double absolutely should not be calling your sister a bigot for being upset.", "He wasted years of her life and made her think he loved her all the while knowing he didn\u2019t. YTA for saying no one was wronged here", "YTA, the truth of the matter is you ex bil used your sister because of his own inability to be honest with himself. In no universe is he in the right, and it's insulting that you aren't on your sister's side here. She's been living a lie for years.", ">but this isn't like a normal divorce where someone was significantly wronged.\n\nUhhh ex-BIL just compared being married to her to cutting himself/self harm. In my book thats wronging someone.\n\nYTA, i get coming out is hard, but you dont get to use others like that to try and \"degay\" yourself", "If your BIL would have confessed that he was in love with a woman all the time he was married to your sister you would be enraged. This is exactly the same. Your sister has been cheated on emotionally, lied and betrayed. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nNothing in your post suggests a justification for calling your sister homophobic, and that\u2019s a deeply insensitive reaction to her understandable devastation. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what it would be like for my partner to reveal that everything about our intimacy together was a lie rooted in self-hatred. That would feel like a profound betrayal. While I \u2014 a neutral third party and queer person \u2014 can understand his journey and empathize, I can also understand how that would be impossible for her to do at this moment when the wound is so fresh. \n\nIf you can\u2019t be there for your sister because you can\u2019t understand how she feels, that\u2019s okay. But it\u2019s not okay to attack her for her emotional journey. And there is nothing to \u201creason\u201d with. She\u2019s going through it. Reason has nothing to do with it. What she needs right now is love and support, not judgment.", "YTA & so are all of the people trying to \u201creason\u201d with her. She was deceived & badly hurt by someone she loved & trusted. He described their marriage as just another form of self hatred. Imagine having someone you love describe your love & marriage like that. That\u2019s not a \u201creason with\u201d situation. That\u2019s a sympathy & support situation. I think the stbx\u2019s situation is sad, too. I have known people on both sides of this situation, & so much about it is heartbreaking. So, accept that your sister\u2019s heart is broken & that many people express their pain by being angry. Quit trying to tell her how to feel. Quit sticking up for your ex BIL. This isn\u2019t about your sister not liking queer people. This is about your sister dealing with being deceived & hurt on a very fundamental level.", "YTA, your sister was manipulated by this man into marrying him and in now in her thirties getting separated from a man who says she was his punishment. It is horrific for your sister, particularly if she wants kids there is not much time left for her now, your sisters whole world was a lie for years and you think she wasn't wronged. You suck.", "YTA. Whether the person he was in love with was another man, or a woman, the psychological effect on your sister is the same. Your ex-BIL hid the truth from his spouse about his feelings for another person, rather than being honest with himself AND her and being a grownup about it.\n\nYour sister has been betrayed by the person she was supposed to be able to trust. This isn't a \"oh yay, he's coming out!\" celebration party, this is the destruction of a marriage. Act accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edited to add*: I was a willing beard for quite a few closeted teenage boys in the 80's at school. The operative word is *willing;* I was aware they were gay, and that I was a 'cover story' so their parents wouldn't kick them out. \n\nYour sister did not give her consent to be her husband's cover story, or his flagellation device, or whatever it is he saw her as during the marriage. This sort of violation goes deep, and calling the person who did this to her a 'nice guy' is frankly delusional.", "YTA. Your sister was deceived and used. In that last conversation, your ex-BIL reframed the pain that he caused as self-destructive behaviour to diminish the pain that he put your sister through.\n\nIt would be a completely different story if your ex-BIL was in denial about his sexuality, then felt comfortable coming out and understood that his wife was harmed through it, but from your telling, he's been completely selfish about it. Plenty of other people have (unfortunately) been through the same thing and have been able to acknowledge how messy and complicated the situation is.\n\nYou clearly don't understand. Imagine being in love with someone, marrying them, and finding out that your entire relationship was a lie, and that you meant absolutely nothing to your partner, who never wanted you. Who you made love with - but they were secretly disgusted the whole time. Who told you that they loved you, you believed it, but that was a lie, too.\n\nIt's great that your ex-BIL is free to be himself, but he's also left carnage in his wake. Your sister's trust is shattered. She's going to feel violated every time she remembers each kiss they shared, each embrace they shared, and worse, every time they had sex.\n\nInstead of you actually bothering to listen to her, all you've heard is \"gay man came out\" and decided that a traumatised woman who needs support is homophobic instead to try and shut her up. She's only new to therapy to try and help her! What, is she supposed to be happy that she was lied to and betrayed by the man she fell in love with? Throw a party for him?\n\nDo better and apologise, or go no-contact with your sister to spare her your kind of casual cruelty. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA.  Your sister was lied to for years and cheated on at least emotionally.  Probably physically.\n\nIt's not her fault they are getting divorced.\n\nETA. I just want to clarify I don't think the ex is blameless but I totally understand people who empathize with what he has gone through.  \n\nThere can be more then one victim in a story, and a victim can still be an AH.", "YTA. Holy fuck. You get that he completely used her, right? It's not just that they're getting divorced; lots of people get divorced. He was lying to her from the jump. Her reaction to being lied to, taken advantage of, and humiliated is completely reasonable and justified.", "YTA \n\nYour sister has just found out her whole relationship and marriage was a lie. A cover story. A way for him to hide and punish himself. \n\nShe\u2019s given up years of her life to a man who knew he could never truly love her or want her. Time she could of found a man who would truest want and love her. All to be his beard.", "No one was wronged in this marriage?! So ex BIL lying and using your sister as a beard is considered what? This man dated her, proposed to her, started to build a life with her while knowing/ suspending (?) that he\u2019s gay\u2026 instead of figuring himself out he strung your sister along for how many years, that she\u2019s never going to get back. Not to mention how many years of therapy she has ahead before she can trust anyone else. YTA", "YTA, she isn't \"complaining about her ex being queer\" like you say she's dealing with being lied to and used and basically told her all the physical affection she though was love, all the sexual moments that she thought was passion, was actually just his self hatred manifesting. As much as I believe everyone should be who they are, you also have to see the other side, that she was manipulated and lied to because he wasn't ready to come out.", "YTA. Your sister HAS BEEN significantly wronged. Your BIL lied to her for years, and married her under false pretenses. He doesn\u2019t get a magical \u201cget out of asshole status\u201d card simply because he\u2019s finally decided to come out of the closet and embrace his true self. He\u2019s still been a deceitful asshole to your sister, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s devastated. How do you not see that he has hurt her?", "YTA I bet everyone is being really supportive of her ex-husband, she probably feels very unsupported and wants people to acknowledge that this was a complete explosion of her life and future and you do need to give her space to vent\n\nTheir marriage being a self manifestation of self hatred, yes thats sad, but she had to hear him call their life together something so horrific\n\nThose words are CRUEL, even if its true, its not something he should ever said to her\n\nTalk about kicking someone when they are down\n\nShe IS the one that was significantly wronged\n\nAs hard as it is to be gay in society, he still made the choice to use her, to hide behind her, where was the consideration for her, how betrayed must she feel, how he lied, their love was not real, not romantically and he knew that, but she didnt\n\nJust because he had struggles doesnt make it ok to ignore the harm he caused another person, him coming out gay does not absolve him\n\n Their life together was a self manifestation of his self hatred, ready that over and over and pay attention what that actually means, think it through and what that must feel like when thats directed at you\n\nYou dont have to hate him, but if you love your sister you need to acknowledge he used her and the harm he did to her", "YTA She was lied to, period. So what if he is gay, he lied to your sister and probably fucked her up in the head. If it was a woman BIL was in love with, would you feel the same. Gay or straight, he was wrong for living a lie and dragging someone else with him. Think about your sister, not some guy who can't figure out who he love, man or woman.", ">Apparently dude's been half in love with his best friend for years and decided it was time for him to stop running from that.\n\nYTA He was carrying on an emotional affair, so regardless of his sexuality, that does make him the bad guy here.", "I think you need to cognitively reframe a little here... your BIL has known this about himself for years and years.  He went into this marriage with your sister in spite of suspecting or knowing that he was gay and in love with his best friend.  Then years later he pulled the rug out from under her and is off to live his authentic life and she just... got blindsided.  And you can't see that your sister was in some way wronged here and has a right to her feelings and to be upset?  If he lied about... say... being in love with another woman would you see her point?  Because although the underlying cause is different, the feeling of being deceived is the same.\n\nLook, I have sympathy for both of them here.  It's a really sad situation where internalized homophobia and self-loathing have led BIL to hurt your sister.  But make no mistake, your sister got hurt here and she is entitled to be upset.  \n\nShe's not complaining about her ex being queer... she's complaining about her ex lying to her about something very important, then pulling the rug out from under her completely.  The fact of what he was lying about is incidentally to her feeling betrayed.  Honestly, the best case scenario here is that they separate, live their best authentic lives, and can find partners in the future where they can both be happy.  But if you can't understand why she is finding this long view a little difficult right now, you're not being very empathetic with her situation and YTA for that.", "YTA\n\nI am a big ally of the LGBTQ+ community and I always applaud anyones choice to live their authentic lives. I can even understand that in this situation and your lond history, you would want to support him in this journey.\n\nBut that doesn't negate the fact that your BIL has decieved his wife for years, forcing her into a marriage he never intended to fulfill to it's fullest potential. That is something unforgivable and heartbreaking for your sister to go through. And let's not even forget that it's not even only his sexuality, no its unspoken love towards his friend. So every interaction your sister had with her ex husband and his friend now also feel like deceit. \n\nShe had a reason to be angry, feel betrayed and wronged. It's not your place to offer your opinion on how she should react because she is right. You weren't having sex with your BIL, living with him, making memories etc, so you ACTUALLY have no idea what you are talking about. She's entitled to her feelings and should be able to vent to others about what happened.", "YTA\n\nOf course, it sucks for (ex) BIL that he denied his sexualty for all of his life. But you sister has to bear the aftermath of it. Imagine being told that all of your love, all the effort that you have put into a relationship, and the most beautiful day of your life *were all a lie.* FFS, I can't even imagine what your sister is going through. Being his partner and wife has been a major part of her identity for years, and now she is being told that everything was a sham.\n\nShe must feel absolutely horrible and lost. Her entire world has disintegrated. Her self-esteem must have taken a severe hit - because how could you not question every last bit about yourself after being told that what you thought is a loving relationship is actually considered f'ing *self-harm.* Imagine that whenever you were intimate with the *love of your life,* he  thought of it as *punishment*. I'd probably fall apart if I were in her position.\n\nHeck. BIL is such an AH, even if he considered life with her as a form of elaborate self-harm, he's pure evil to say that to her face. Of course, he can't help his sexual orientation. BUT how he's led her on for years and how he ended things are disgusting.", "YTA \n\nThis is a divorce where someone was significantly wronged. *Your sister* was significantly wronged. \n\nHer ex husband lied to her about his sexuality and used her as a beard for years.

She was completely betrayed and has had her whole life upended. Why is her pain not valid to you?", "Yoo. Sorry but whatever that boy is going through, you're sister is not in a condition to empathize with him. She's hurt right now. I wouldn't say YTA for empathizing with you ex BIL. But YTA for not empathizing with your sister!", "YTA because you lack empathy from both sides, based on the limited information we have in this post.\n\nBIL could be an AH, if he knew who he was and lied to himself and his wife; not an AH if, based on his background, he didn't have a chance to be himself. Still hurtful to \"find himself\" after committing to someone, ,who, in good faith, offered love and life to the relationship.\n\nSister is not an AH for feeling blindsided, even if she can probably understand, eventually, that her ex hadn't come around to his truth prior to the wedding. She is a \"collateral damage\" and that is hurtful any way you want to justify it. She was a wronged party if she married on false pretenses.\n\nRefusing to recognize her hurt, pain and sense of betrayal, as much as ex BIL could be understood depending on the circumstances, feels cruel. What is the \"acceptable amount of time\" for her to stop feeling blindsided for your liking? You can sympathize with him while still acknowledge her pain and anger. They are not mutually exclusive.", "YTA\n\nIn a perfect world, ex BIL wouldn't have to hide who he is and could be out freely with the person he loves.  But unfortunately that world doesn't exist yet. And while you can sympathize with what he's been through and the hardships he faces as a gay person, it still doesn't change the fact that he, as an independent adult, lied and deceived your sister into thinking he loved her. He knew he was in love with someone else. Those are years of her life she will never get back. She won't get closure. It's probably destroyed any trust she has of dating someone else and wondering if they're hiding something as well. You're acting like they should just shrug it off and be friends because you're thinking this isn't a dramatic, someone cheated on someone, marriage ending.  But the truth is, being intimate with someone you're in love with and finding out they're just going through the motions/faking it is soul crushing.\n\nShe's been horribly betrayed and she has every right to be angry about it. She doesn't want people trying to downplay that or brush it aside with silver lining talk. The more you try and be sympathetic about BIL, the less she feels she's being supported. You're aren't taking HER pain seriously. \n\nLet her be angry. Let her grieve the loss of her marriage, of her relationship. Of all those future plans she was going to have with him. Let her go to therapy and support her. If your sister started saying horrible things about the gay community as a whole, then yeah I'd shut that shit down. But that's not the case.  She's just angry at this man and she has every right to be. You need to stop pretending \"this isn't like a normal divorce\" because that's stupidly naive.", "YTA. Your sister was wronged in a MAJOR way.

I knew I was queer/gay and I chose to get married to a woman. I made a choice that ended up hurting someone badly. The BIL knew he was in love with a man, he made a choice to hide that and to marry your sister. I truly feel awful for her, because I know how much hurt that causes someone. I did it myself to my ex wife about 5 years back now and I still go to therapy to work though the pain and hurt I caused her. I also know that my ex will never forgive me and honestly she never should.

This came as a shock to the family since, from what we could tell, there were no issues. My brother in law is a great guy who fit into our family from the jump and someone I (25m) would still consider a friend now, even though they're separating. \n\nThe reason for their separation is that my BIL came out as gay. Apparently dude's been half in love with his best friend for years and decided it was time for him to stop running from that. In a move that I didn't think was very cool since this is something ultra personal, my sister told us that during one of their last conversations he described their marriage as just another form of the physical ways his self hatred would manifest, similar to actions he performed as a teenager. The way she said it made it sound like she expected it to make us angry, but it just made me sad. Everything she's said about the ending of their relationship and she response to it makes me sad, honestly. \n\nThis is not an anti-sister post. I feel a lot of sympathy for her having to reroute the course of her life, but this isn't like a normal divorce where someone was significantly wronged. It seems she wants us all to board the 'hate former-BIL train' and I just can't get behind that. Every time anyone tries to reason with her, she shuts them down so I mostly stopped engaging with the topic of divorce altogether.\n\nShe's been going to a therapy support group for the last few weeks but still saying she doesn't feel like she's getting the support she needs. After hearing this on repeat for a while, I finally asked her if the support she 'needs' is just a space to complain about her ex being queer without feeling judged for doing so. She got visibly angry at me and told me I \"don't understand\" and I'm \"taking his side.\"\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm willing to bet it's not about him being gay, but everything else that comes with being gay while PRETENDING TO BE IN LOVE WITH HER. This man lied to her their entire relationship. They made plans for a future together that he was never fully committed to. They at least had a place together. Furniture. A routine. A wedding. Hopefully they didn't have kids, but now if that's something she wants, she has wasted her time with a man who is in love with his best friend (was he the best man at the wedding? just curious). \n\nThis isn't a normal divorce. Your sister didn't fall out of love with her husband. He lied to her and crushed the life they were building together when he could've avoided all of this by confronting his feelings.

Self hatred is baked into queerness because from such a young age being queer is often policed and repressed by people who are supposed to love and support you. It is repressed by your peers and soon you repress yourself so you can fit in. There are so many gay men who are ignorant of their sexuality, who get into relationships thinking they have finally fit in, only to realize later that they don't. It is absolutely tragic for everyone. \n\nYour BIL did not set out to hurt anyone. He made a mistake. Yes, this mistake upended a relationship. But that is life. It sucks, but doing something that upsets other people doesn't make you an asshole. And you being supportive and understanding of his situation doesn't make him an asshole either.

But he destroyed your sister's life on his \"personal journey\" to his truth. Divorce is a terrible thing to go through, even when you want one.

He owed her honesty, but there is such a thing as oversharing. \n\nYou are looking from the outside in and you seem to feel that ex BIL wasn't just using her but was grappling with something bigger than him and has been doing it for *years.* He never gave your sister any choice but to grapple it with him but he never told her what was going on.
