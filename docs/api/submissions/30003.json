We have 3 kids 5F 7M and 9M. She did not have an amazing childhood and so I think she is constantly trying to make sure our kids do. \n\nShe home makes every birthday cake, diys the birthday decorations, makes pajamas for every holiday and always home makes the Halloween costume. She also does these theme monthly movie nights, where she creates this whole scene. For example this month was coraline, she make custom dolls for each kid, welcome home cake and the whole food spread.\n\nThis is all great but the problem is she expects me to help. All are kids are in activities, we both have full time careers, and I believe she stretches herself thin trying to do all this. And also expects me to. We have the money to just go out and buy stuff so I don\u2019t get way we have to do so much. She says these are the things the kids will remember.\n\nAnyway this all came to head as I\u2019ve been out of town most of the month for work so she\u2019s had to shoulder the full responsibility of the kids. This caused her to be behind on making the costumes and she\u2019s stressed. She was asking me if I\u2019d be able to create one of the costumes for her, she has the supplies and can walk me through. The problem is I just don\u2019t feel like it. I told her we can go get a cheap costume, it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nWell she refused and was up all night finishing these costumes. I told her this morning that they looked awesome and she just rolled her eyes. She was making coffee and I asked if she\u2019d make me a cup, she replied go buy one. She\u2019s been distant and cold. I was talking to my coworker and he called me out. Saying my wife is right, my kids will remember the effort my wife put in and they\u2019ll also remember how hard I made it for her.\n\nNow I\u2019m feeling off, like maybe I am the AH. But at the same time I usually do help a bit, I was thinking this one time wouldn\u2019t be a big deal since we were both tired. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nOkay I\u2019m the AH, I\u2019ll apologize and see if she needs help with anything else. However I\u2019m positive half the parents commenting don\u2019t do these things and still think they\u2019re doing a great job.", "created_utc": 1698691715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k0j2n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_wife_with/", "score": 874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, really guy? You were away for a month and she had to deal with the kids herself, then she asked for help and rather than you guys ordering food, putting some music on, and having a night together finishing the costume, you decided it wasn't worth the effort. The worst part was the audacity asking her to pour/make you a coffee the following morning, when you knew she'd been up all night stressing \n\nIt's about how we make things work, being there when we see our partner struggling (this also includes when we ourselves are burnt out). You could have had a nice night with your Mrs and you fudged it, aye she might be a bit over the top when it comes to going the extra mile for your kids...but isn't that what makes it magical?\n\nAs someone who grew up with a shitty childhood, I applaud her efforts.", "YTA - Even if this isn't something that you prioritize all the time, you could have helped her with the costume because it's important to her. But, beyond that, your attitude about your wife's efforts is just terrible.\n\nShe's working her hardest to show the kids they're a priority to her, and making really fun and special memories for them. And all you have to say about it is that it's a waste of time? The fact that you don't appreciate and support her efforts is just really, really sad.\n\nWhat do you propose she do with the extra time she would save by not making things special for the kids? What do you do to spend time with your kids and show them you care? Your coworker is right - the way you're behaving must be making your wife so, so sad.edit: BTW - She's been taking care of the kids most of the month by herself so you can go out of town and further your career. Do you do the same for her? Or is she expected to be the one to take off work every time the kids need something? It really seems like you take her for granted.", "YTA - \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u201d isn\u2019t really a valid response. Do you do *anything* to help her out? Buy supplies for her so she doesn\u2019t have to run to the store. Shoulder more of the household chores so she can spend more time on the costumes.\n\nYou can compromise here.", "Not maybe. You're the ahole. \n\nShe's behind because she's been working a full time career and parenting your kids by herself for a full month, without any of your help. \n\nAnd she asks you to help with one thing and you complain? Because you're tired? Really?\n\nYtA", "YTA\n\n>I was talking to my coworker and he called me out. Saying my wife is right, my kids will remember the effort my wife put in and they\u2019ll also remember how hard I made it for her.\n\nThe fact your Co worker is acting as a better husband than you, should be scary for you.\n\nFor a month youve had nearly Zero responsibility bar your job and when she ask you to be an active parent, you just decide \"I don't want to\". Have you always been a lazy parent or partner or has this always been this way since you think youre to good for it\n\n\nYou've just become a problem/chore for your wife, be careful or she'll have had enough and leave", "YTA. I was going to say NAH, except that your only reason for not helping her do one costume after she's been taking care of the kids alone while working fulll-time for a whole month while you were out of town was that you don't feel like it, and also your suggestion was kind of unfair and not really viable. \n\nIt's definitely worth having a conversation with your wife about your concern that she's spreading herself too thin (maybe compromise and she does less and you help a set amount)-- but the time for that conversation is not 2 days before Halloween. Think about this-- you have three kids. Your wife is hand-making two of the costumes, probably to be exactly what the kids asked for. You were asked to help assemble the third costume and instead suggested going out and buying a cheap costume two days before Halloween. So what would have happened if she had done it your way is that two kids would have had homemade custom costumes that they picked, and one kid would have had whatever costume was left over in their size at Target. Your wife may be wrong about the kids needing *all* of this elaborate stuff to have good memories, but I can tell you the kid who got the cheap costume would 100% have remembered that forever. Even the five year old is old enough to remember that. The timing of your refusal--especially the fact that it also came after she was with the kids solo for a whole month-- when you just didn't feel like it makes you TA here. \n\nSometime after Halloween maybe have a discussion about how you're worried she's too stressed, but you both have limited free time, and while you support her wanting the kids to have amazing memories, you also want her to be happy and have downtime with the kids, and for the kids to remember their mom having fun with them, not stressed and bogged down in preparations, and perhaps she could continue doing most of these amazing things, but, like, buy \\*some\\* of the birthday decorations sometimes, or do \\*one\\* elaborate food thing on movie nights, or keep making the Halloween costumes, but buy the holiday pajamas instead of making a new set the kids will outgrow in a year--and maybe then make them each one when they're older teens that will fit them longer, or when they come back from college as a fun throwback to memories of both the handmade (and, potentially, future purchased) holiday pajama times. \n\nThe kids will definitely have good memories from what she is doing-- I remember when my mom made an elaborate \"castle\" out of painted sheets in the basement for my 8th birthday, that she still always makes our birthday cakes even as adults, and that she sewed part of a very specific Halloween costume for me. But the memories of when she took me trick-or-treating in a costume I picked out and bought, or when I had a birthday party where we just decorated with store-bought crepe paper streamers and balloons in my favorite colors, or when we had family movie nights where we ate microwave popcorn, are just as precious-- and so are the memories of just hanging out with my mom when she wasn't stressed or overwhelmed and could actually enjoy stuff with us. Thing is though, I also remember my dad helping us when she was stressed and overwhelmed. He had very limited free time, especially when I was little--he was out of town for work a ton and also had a brutal commute until we moved closer to his work-- and was often exhausted, but he also would always help her out--especially if she had to specifically ask him. Your kids remember that kind of thing too, and it'll shape how they view what's important and acceptable in their future relationships. You don't have to spend all your free time doing this stuff--that's her choice-- but there are definitely conversations and compromises to be had here.", "Holy fuck YTA. \"I just don't feel like it\". Really, dude? I can tell you from experience, she's not going to let you ride her coattails forever when it comes to your kids. They'll remember who thought bringing home money counted as parenting and who actually did things with and for them. THAT is what she was referring to.", "Asking her to make you a cup of coffee was where I lost it. I can understand you not having the interest in making costumes. Store bought costumes will not ruin a 5 year old's childhood. But you could have put in at least some effort since you were asked.\n\nYou seem to think because you have a job (and she has the kids 24/7) that when your day is done, it's DONE.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your wife sounds amazing. Like extra awesome. I\u2019d think real had about how long your go the extra mile, talented, generous wife will put up with your indifference and lack of contribution. Also, she\u2019s right. Your kids will never forget what she does for them. They will also remember how you scorned her efforts. Sounds like your wife has built an amazing and loving family. It would be kinda cool if you joined it.", "INFO- Do the kids appreciate and like everything your wife does? Do they like the homemade costumes and dolls for movie nights?", "She\u2019s really over the top. I have a sister like this, who exhausts herself on things that she alone thinks are important, and wants everyone to be as excited as she about them. We all want her to take it down a notch (or four).\n\nHowever, you lost me when you declined to help with costumes, knowing that she would be up all night. Suck it up and help for once.", "YTA\n\n\n\nMy mom did homemade costumes for us until we were in high school almost, and YES I do have extremely fond memories of how much effort and creativity she put into them. It meant a lot to me, and I'm sure your children will feel the same way as they grow up. Your wife is doing so much to make your kids' childhoods special, and saying you \"don't feel like\" helping her sucks. Go the extra mile with her sometimes, jeez.", "Gosh it must just be terrible for you having such a great mother for your kids who wants to give them a wonderful childhood.   Just such a downer.\n\nYTA\n\nYou know what--I bet sometimes she does things that she doesn't really feel like doing either.  But she does them because they are important to you.  But god forbid you do something ONCE....one freaking time....to help her out.\n\nThese are exactly the type of men who are suddenly posting about how their wives asked for a divorce and it came out of the blue and they just don't understand.  It's this type of shit that drips on women over and over and over until one day we just can't stand it anymore and we walk out.  It's this.........", "Probably gonna go with YTA because\n\n*The problem is I just don't feel like it*", "> However I\u2019m positive half the parents commenting don\u2019t do these things and still think they\u2019re doing a great job.\n\nBecause that\u2019s the *only* way to be a great parent, right? \ud83d\ude44", "I was firmly N A H until I read this\n\n>The problem is I just don\u2019t feel like it. I told her we can go get a cheap costume, it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nMy guy are you acquaintances or married? Try putting in some minimal effort for your wife and kids. You don't need to be a pastry chef or seamstress but would it kill you to help out a little? At the very least you and your wife need to get on the same page about expectations.\n\nYTA bro", "YTA. This is something that was important to your wife, and she asked for your help.", "YTA - \n\n>The problem is I just don\u2019t feel like it. \n\nIf she is stretched to thin, help her out with what\u2019s needed immediately then address the issue. But what you did here makes you an AH.", "Yta I was on the fence until your reason was 'I don't feel like it'.  I bet she doesn't feel like being a single parent for weeks at a time while you're on your work trips. You did 0 parenting for the majority of the month, and you couldn't be bothered to help.\n\n\"Go buy one\" is a far nicer response than you would have gotten from me in that situation.", "YTA-If she\u2019s spent a month operating as a working single mom and then you come home and add nothing of value to her life why should she keep you around?", "Everybody is saying YTA, and I agree in this context\u2026however, my wife and I also have careers and one of her love languages is home-making things like cakes and costumes too. However, there are times she stresses out about it and makes a big mess (which I clean since that\u2019s our typical division of labor). I talked to her several times about how every now and then she needs to take a step back and \u201chit the easy button\u201d. That could mean buying an ice cream cake or buying a costume if she doesn\u2019t have time to commit to the project. \n\nMy explanation was that if she\u2019s going to stress herself or the kids out it\u2019s counterproductive and they\u2019d be happier if she\u2019d spend time with them in a less stressed-out state. It doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t hand make things some, or even most of the time. It\u2019s just that when life isn\u2019t allowing for it, she should make a reasonable adjustment. Staying up all night would be one of those situations where I\u2019d just remind her to \u201chit the easy button\u201d and get a good night of sleep so she\u2019s not grumpy the next day. \n\nI think in this particular situation with you out of town and her being out of time, it\u2019s a situation where y\u2019all could have had a conversation and made an allowance this particular month instead of her staying up all night. The kids won\u2019t hold it against you that one month out of the year the costumes weren\u2019t handmade.", "YTA. She's stretched thin because you're not helping. She's being a super mom and you're being a lacklustre dad.

They'll remember you couldn't be bothered to even pitch in.", "YTA big time. Have you ever thought it\u2019s not only for the kids happy memories but your wife enjoys putting in the effort, baking the cakes, decorating for the movie nights because it gives her satisfaction and also makes her happy to make stuff with love for the family\n\nYou really sound awful. It\u2019s not about convenience, you have put no effort into understanding her point of view and you\u2019re being a terrible partner. Maybe she would have more time to relax if her life mate and father of her children contributed some of his precious time to helping her with what\u2019s important to her.", "YTA.

I was the Mum who worked fulltime and did most of the organizing and planning for special kid events. What it took me a long time to realise is that you don't have to be the biggest and best at everything. In fact, this kind of behaviour sets kids up for unreasonable expectations. If your wife chooses to go overboard, you shouldn't be guilted into being part of that. But you should help out to a reasonable degree, because it is clearly creating magic for the kids. What you describe, however, is OTT in my opinion (monthly movie nights with tailor-made handcrafted items). There does need to be compromise on all sides. What magic are you creating for the children?", "Your kids wont want all this stuff forever, eventually they will want to spend birthdays out with friends and not wanna watch movies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut the kids won\u2019t mind if everything isn\u2019t handmade, they don\u2019t need dolls for a themed movie night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nonly thing I\u2019d say should be handmade is cake because store bought can be nasty. My mum once made my party have a 10ft catapillar cake as I had a hugeeeeee party. I dont renember my clothes or presents but I remember that huge cake.\n\nall I can suggest is say you don\u2019t mind helping out but In advance and not leave it late. My mum made me cat hoods and a tail and I wore that for a fair few years, had a dress up box of second hand stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel sewing 3 handmade dolls for each movie month might be a lot on her plate depending on how long they take to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsounds like your wife is a crafty wizard. She must make cool stuff. Maybe she could buy plain pjs and add custom names?", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like getting takeout vs a homemade meal. Do they both accomplish the same goal? Yes but having someone take the time and effort to do something for you feels better than just throwing money at an issue. If you think about what items or memories that are most important to you, are they mostly about store bought items or do they have some experience/little something extra to them that made them special?\n\nThe kids will remember your wife making an effort to show them that they are more than a box to check. People do have great childhoods that don\u2019t involve homemade items, but your wife is weaving magic that will stay with your kids for a lifetime. She\u2019s making them feel important and going a step beyond to make sure they know in their bones that they matter to someone. \n\nEven if you think she\u2019s going overboard, it\u2019s important to her. At the very least you could help with the one costume for no other reason than it would help take the stress off your wife even if the stress was self inflicted.", "If your only legitimate excuse is \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like it\u201d then yeah, YTA. \n\nThat said, I feel honored to be able to welcome you to reality.

Thank you", "Right?! \u201cThe problem is I just don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d No, Sir, that\u2019s not the problem.
