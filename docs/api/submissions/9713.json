My parents and eldest brother did while I was growing up. I can still remember the stains on the ceiling and the lingering smoke. It was the 80s and no one would bat an eye. But third hand smoke, and clearly now the 3rd hand vape residue is a problem- building up on surfaces and in fabrics", "How is this misogynistic?", "It's fairly simple reasoning if you understand narcolepsy. Those with narcolepsy have a difficult time staying awake during the daytime, and a difficult time staying asleep (and getting the correct amounts of each stage of sleep) at nighttime. Because of this, we are often treated in a two-fold way: we take stimulants for daytime to help us function and stay awake during the day, and we take Xyrem or Xywav to help us get the right amount of sleep, in the right stages of sleep, at night. The biggest issue with our nighttime sleep is that, without the use of the Xyrem/Xywav (or a few other less-effective medications), we spend the vast majority of our sleep in REM, which is a very active sleep phase for the brain. We don't get enough of the sleep where our brains actually **rest.** That lack of brain-restorative sleep leads to our excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other issues.\n\nWith prescription stimulant medication, you can get a bit more daytime \"normalcy,\" at the expense of pretty awful side effects. And because most RX stimulants have fairly long half-life (Ritalin, for example, is anywhere from about 3.5 hours up to nearly 8 hours), we have to be very careful not to take it too late in the day. That means that for many of us, we take one dose of stimulant in the morning, and another either later in the morning, or early in the afternoon. Once that second dose wears off, we're essentially fucked for the rest of the day. Taking a third dose means we might sleep even more poorly that night, leading to a domino effect that is just pure hell for days.\n\nNicotine, however, has several benefits for us. For one, it's a shorter-acting stimulant. It kicks in pretty fast compared to pills, and its half-life is about 2 hours. That means that if I need a bit of a boost after my ritalin starts to wane, I can take a few puffs off of my vape as I need it and not have to worry as much about it interfering with my sleep, since it'll wear off much more quickly. Additionally, while RX stimulants like Ritalin, Adderal, Nuvigil, Provigil, Concerta, etc. tend to cause anxiety, nicotine also functions as an anxiolytic. It can actually soothe anxiety a bit. For me, someone with both type 1 narcolepsy and severe GAD, that anxiolytic effect is also quite helpful without having to add something like xanax, ativan, or valium to calm the anxiety from more ritalin. \n\nAlso bear in mind that nicotine is able to be absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes. So I don't **have to** inhale my vape into my lungs. If I take just a mouth hit and hold it in my mouth for several seconds, I will still absorb a fair amount of nicotine without ever involving my lungs in the process. And this is how I often use my vape. I can also control how high of a dose of nicotine I am using by changing up the e-liquid (or \"juice\") that I use. I generally use a very low dosage of 3mg/ml juice in my vape. If I need a bigger boost of stimulation from it, I just take 3 hits instead of 1. \n\nNow, all this said, I doubt my sleep specialist/neurologist would recommend that **every single PWN** (person with narcolepsy) use nicotine for their symptom management. But he knows my medical history, he knows my laundry list of other chronic illness diagnoses, and he knows how many things I have tried, over the course of many years, before trying nicotine as a last resort to try and have any semblance of a normal existence. And **in my specific case,** he has agreed with my use of nicotine, and has encouraged me to continue using it unless or until a new treatment for narcolepsy is developed that doesn't make any of my other chronic conditions worse. So for now, and for the foreseeable future, this is my best option.", "Flight attendant: tell em! I hate people like this.
