I don't turn meals into a whole photoshoot production when I go out, but I like to snap a few photos of everything as it comes out. I've got about 1000 followers, it's just a hobby for me but I have made friends with some other bloggers and we like to go out and get pics together and try new restaurants. I prefer doing this with my foodie girls because my boyfriend HATES it, and will go out of his way to take a big bite of food or mess up his plate with his fork before I can snap any pics, and he rolls his eyes when I take pics of my own food so I pretty much stopped bothering when we went out together.\n\nMoney has been tight lately because of some medical bills, so I haven't been able to go out to eat with my foodie girls and the infrequent date with my boyfriend is the only chance I get to eat out. I had to sit him down and have a \"Look, just let me enjoy things,\" conversation with him and told him I was gonna take pics of my own food when we went out and could he please just not be immature about it. And since we alternate who pays for dates, I told him I would appreciate it if he could spare the 30 seconds for me to snap a pic of the appetizer + his meal on nights that I was paying, and I got a sort of half-hearted \"do whatever you want\" confirmation.\n\nSunday was my turn to pay, and he let me take a pic of the appetizer with minimal fussing. But then when the entrees came out, I went to snap a pic of his and he messed it up with his fork. Then he reached over and stirred up MY pasta to also ruin the photo of my own meal! I was so pissed off by that that I refused to pay his half at the end of the meal, which pissed him off because he said he wouldn't have ordered a cocktail if he knew that I was gonna skip my turn. He says I owe him one because I don't get to just decide not to pay according to our agreement after we've already ordered.", "created_utc": 1684856215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13prznw/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_boyfriends_food/", "score": 14870, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, people who take photos of their food usually take way longer and are way more obnoxious about it than they realize- I seriously have to wonder just how much of your time and attention this is taking away from actually enjoying the company of the person you\u2019re with.

Do you take pictures of your food when he pays? It's not a big deal that you take pics of your own food, but that's not what dates are for...\n\nI also think he can be annoyed at you doing this, since going out is meant to be an interaction between the two of you, he's not going to dinner with you so you can spend that time on your phone.\n\nHe shouldn't have ruined your plate, but now he has to pay because you couldn't show it off to your followers who you don't know? IMO, this is just as bad as saying that \"you're a Yelp reviewer\". He also shouldn't associate ordering a drink with whether or not he's paying (not cool), but you changed the conditions after agreeing to pay.\n\nYou both suck.

How about in future situations, you take a photo of the appetizers and your food ONLY, and tell him you won't take a photo of his since you're respecting his space and privacy.

Like obviously he was a jerk after he said \"fine do whatever you want\" to not allow you to do whatever you want.\n\nBut honestly, you are too.  You frame it as its just \"something you enjoy\" but the reality is, you're on a date night.  You can't save your hobby with your \\*1,000\\* adoring fans to when you are alone or with like-minded friends?  I mean, to you, it's just snapping a quick photo.  But if I was him, it would sure make me feel like the photo (which I dislike you doing in the first place) is more important to you than the fact you are trying to enjoy a meal together.  \n\nFor goodness sake, enjoy moments occasionally, and not worry about taking a picture of a salad you'll never think twice about again.", "ESH. \n\nThe two of you need a better way to deal with this than you are both currently engaged in.\n\nYour BF hates your hobby, which is fine.

Maybe it doesn\u2019t feel like a big production to you, but it\u2019s annoying to him. At the very least limiting the photos to just your dish seems very reasonable, regardless of who is paying.\n\nHave you ever tried to have a mature conversation with him about why this bothers him?", "YTA - I hate when someone thinks they need to take a pic of my food before I eat it.  You focus on your food and he wouldn\u2019t tamper with yours.", "Esh what he did was childish but from your post you get upset when he eats his own food before you can take a picture of it which can get very annoying. It seems like this is a reaction to repeated build up of annoyances on your end and you shouldn\u2019t be expecting people to not eat first so you can take photos", "ESH. Rightly or wrongly, you know it annoys him. And I\u2019m going to say his annoyance is both petty and understandable. For transparency, I\u2019m too old for this to be a normal thing for me, and getting your food and then having to stop the flow of the meal, conversation etc while you take pics is not something he enjoys. It\u2019s like answering a text or taking a quick call - it\u2019s disruptive and distracting and considered rude. So too is shifting your focus to your phone, even if it\u2019s brief. \n\nSo, as much as I think he should just let it happen, I also think you should have stuck with not doing it when you go out with him. As easy as it is for him to grin and bear it, it\u2019s just as easy for you to not do it. \n\nHis reaction was of course very childish, and he\u2019s not winning any points from me there.

You are equal parties in where it has ended up.", "NTA - boyfriend sucks.", "100% NTA for being mad that he messed up your food before you could take a picture, but YTA for being mad that he just wants to eat his food.

Stop taking pictures of HIS food. That should be an agreement you can both agree to. I highly doubt that you snap a quick picture. I\u2019m guessing you have to get the plate just right.

He broke the agreement by not letting you take pictures when you were paying, therefore that agreement is nullified and he can pay for his own meal. \n\nIf he is this dismissive and intentionally sabotaging your hobby, there are deeper issues at play that you need to work on", "ESH. this relationship sounds shallow as hell", "You know, I was going to go with E-S-H because your BF messing with your food was really childish and rude, but after reading comment after comment from you, I'm realising exactly why he snapped and did that.\n\n**YTA**\n\nYou keep going on in the comments about how \"it never takes more than 45 seconds\", and defending yourself because of that.

But when you treat someone else to a meal, you are not paying for the right to do as you please with their food. That's not how that works.\n\nAnd after reading your unrelenting defensiveness and refusal to understand that in the comments, it is abundantly clear that your boyfriend messed up YOUR food, not because he is an obnoxious child, but to make you understand that YOU are . . . and how it feels when he asks you repeatedly and tells you over and over that he doesn't want you near his food, and you insist on photographing it anyway.", "NTA. \nAnd even though it's petty and this sub is known for its \" you should break up/divorce\" advice, you really should reconsider your relationship. \n\nBecause\n1.

I don't turn meals into a whole photoshoot production when I go out, but I like to snap a few photos of everything as it comes out. I've got about 1000 followers, it's just a hobby for me but I have made friends with some other bloggers and we like to go out and get pics together and try new restaurants. I prefer doing this with my foodie girls because my boyfriend HATES it, and will go out of his way to take a big bite of food or mess up his plate with his fork before I can snap any pics, and he rolls his eyes when I take pics of my own food so I pretty much stopped bothering when we went out together.\n\nMoney has been tight lately because of some medical bills, so I haven't been able to go out to eat with my foodie girls and the infrequent date with my boyfriend is the only chance I get to eat out. I had to sit him down and have a \"Look, just let me enjoy things,\" conversation with him and told him I was gonna take pics of my own food when we went out and could he please just not be immature about it. And since we alternate who pays for dates, I told him I would appreciate it if he could spare the 30 seconds for me to snap a pic of the appetizer + his meal on nights that I was paying, and I got a sort of half-hearted \"do whatever you want\" confirmation.\n\nSunday was my turn to pay, and he let me take a pic of the appetizer with minimal fussing. But then when the entrees came out, I went to snap a pic of his and he messed it up with his fork. Then he reached over and stirred up MY pasta to also ruin the photo of my own meal! I was so pissed off by that that I refused to pay his half at the end of the meal, which pissed him off because he said he wouldn't have ordered a cocktail if he knew that I was gonna skip my turn. He says I owe him one because I don't get to just decide not to pay according to our agreement after we've already ordered.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH", "ESH. I'm guessing that he hates that you are distracted/working on your hobby, when you're on a date with him. I can kind of understand that, ESPECIALLY if you're taking time to 'pose' the photos', then immediately posting the photos, interacting on your phone, etc., during the meal. It's the same thing as using your phone at the table (with other people present) more generally - it can be rude, depending on the situation. Indeed, I wonder if you're distracted with your phone/hobby more generally when you're with him, and this was the last straw. \n\nIf you're only taking a quick photo of your own food (and doing nothing else), it's not so bad. He shouldn't make it a hill to die on, and it's childish of him to mess up the food in response. However, you SHOULD respect that he really doesn't want you taking photos of HIS food - even if you don't agree. It sounds like you've put inappropriate pressure on him to allow you to (using money as justification), when he's already voiced his wishes against. \n\nIt DOES sound a little obnoxious and immature to me, to be basically saying (especially on a supposedly romantic date): 'I'm paying, so I actually own the food you're eating - and can do what I want with it'. You're trying to use money to control and override his wishes. And yes, you might be paying on that occasion - but overall you're both paying equally for food. So no, you don't 'own' his food overall. \n\nEven if you always paid for all the meals, you'd be gifting him the food. It wouldn't mean you automatically get last say in this context, on whatever happens with his food. And he could make the same argument - that when he pays for YOUR food, he 'owns' it. So he gets to tell you that you're not allowed to take photos of YOUR food, on those occasions. And why are you making this such a hill to die on yourself?! Just take photos of your own food - respect that he doesn't like his own food being photographed. \n\nYou're turning a supposedly romantic date into a controlling fight about who 'owns' the food (and maybe also conflict about divided attention, if you're also posting and commenting at the table). You sound a little childish yourself, quite frankly. Even if him messing up the food was childish, it's also childish to refuse to pay - just because he wouldn't back down and allow something that he clearly finds rude, just because you were trying override/control his wishes on the basis of 'who pays'.", "NTA, at all, because I think you've been super reasonable about expressing what it means to you and asking for minimal respect. \n\nI will add that I find this insufferable when I'm eating out with people and I'm trying to figure out why because it is such a small thing. I think because I feel like we have everything frozen in time for a picture before we can enjoy our food and do anything real, and like I matter as a conversational companion less than the food matters as a pic? A more likely explanation is that I'm just a hangry glutton and want to eat as soon as the food is set down haha!", "Your hobby is frankly super annoying to me (but ultimately harmless) and he's being an ass about it rather than just putting up with someone's quirk.\n\nHe's more the ass in the scenario for deliberately messing with your food. You *don't touch* someone else's food! But I'm going to go ESH because you are also figuratively messing with his food as well (you know he hates the photos and you insist taking pics of his plate before eating.

I\u2019m not religious, and I don\u2019t personally get anything out of either situation, but I\u2019m willing to give up a literal minute of my life in order to make the people I care about happy.

It seems like you\u2019ve found a little community through this hobby. Is it possible for you to spend your eating out money with your friends, and spend other meaningful time with your boyfriend?

She basically tried to overrule him, by claiming she can do what she wants with HIS food - if she's paying for it (though overall, they're paying equally for food, so she doesn't actually 'own' his food). \n\nThat's all very childish, controlling, and obnoxious. And indeed, he could make the same argument, if she wants to play that card - that when HE pays, HE 'owns' her food. So she's not allowed to photograph HER food, on those occasions. Can you imagine how controlling THAT would sound?! \n\nLike others here, I'm guessing this has been the straw that broke the camel's back for him. Maybe she really does just spend 30 secs taking a photo of the food (or maybe she's underestimating that). But maybe she then posts the photos on the date, begins interacting with followers, etc. The number of 'influencers' /bloggers who do that. \n\nThat could get really irritating, very quickly - as any phone use can get at the dinner table, when you're meant to be paying attention to the person you're with. It's irritating when you sit down, looking forward to seeing/talking to somebody, and they're frequently distracted by their phone. Indeed, maybe divided attention/phone use is a more general issue when they're together. \n\nNo, he shouldn't have messed up the food, which was childish. But it was also childish trying to override his clear wishes (on the basis of who pays), and then not pay her half because he wouldn't submit to her demands. Just respect the dude doesn't like his food photographed/their date interrupted so much. Have some generosity towards that, and stop trying to override his wishes through petty things like who pays.

If it was only his food he messed up he would not be an AH\n\nWhat puts him into AH and her into NTA is because he did agree, did not communicate that agreement had ended and then he ruined her dish as well, and I think in response to that OP was well within her rights to not pay for his dinner. Taking a photo of her food would not affect him but ruining her photo did affect her, so she responded. \n\nThat said there\u2019s a mess of communication and understanding issues in this relationship and she should stop asking to take photos of his food", "Nah.

I guess I just don\u2019t see \u201c I won\u2019t take pics of your food on dates you pay for\u201d as much of one, especially because she overrode his clear preferences.

She is punishing him for disliking it when he has every right to his feelings too. He did not say, \"Sure, it's a deal. And, if I don't behave up to your standards, you don't have to pay.\" \n\nI think you should both pay for yourself from now on because, not only are you self-centered, you're selfish and spiteful when he made no such agreement. It appears you think your feelings should always win.", "My wife still has trouble accepting it sometimes because her parents (who divorced when she was a toddler) are both toxic AF in every relationship they ever had. She will tell me I don't have to do something or I shouldnt have done something, and I'll say I know, I don't mind, and does she want me to stop what I'm doing. It's usually a no.", "This. Me and my boyfriend  don't have a rule who pays,one just offers or says, \"Let's go eat, I'll get it.\" He gets so much food ( eats it all so can't complain) where I'm so plain and happy with a child's portion. I know he's gona get alot  but he gets it no matter what even if its his 3rd time on a row paying ( we since had a baby so I get her supplies) if he ordered small portions or cheaper food when he has to pay I'd get so turned off him and never want to go our to eat with him again.\nHow is she putting up with that? It's a huge red flag, especially if she's hospital bills.", "What are you feelings on the pukka vanilla chai? That's my absolute favourite, and as a bonus its caffeine free.", "One time I drove 4 hours to spend a weekend at a guy's house. He proceeded to tell me \"Left 4 Dead 2 just came out so I'm gonna be playing it.\" Thought he meant for an hour or two. Nope. I didn't have a smartphone or literally anything else to do but just boredly watch him. After more hours than I care to admit I finally begged him to have sex. He facefucked me then went back to his game without pleasuring me. This went on the rest of the weekend and I wish I wasn't such a people pleaser back then. Never went back to his place again.\n\nIt was satisfying though, a few years later his girlfriend and I were talking and I brought the story up and she started tearing into him asking how he could be so rude to me. He finally felt the shame he should've felt years prior. \ud83d\ude02"]}
