I don't turn meals into a whole photoshoot production when I go out, but I like to snap a few photos of everything as it comes out. I've got about 1000 followers, it's just a hobby for me but I have made friends with some other bloggers and we like to go out and get pics together and try new restaurants. I prefer doing this with my foodie girls because my boyfriend HATES it, and will go out of his way to take a big bite of food or mess up his plate with his fork before I can snap any pics, and he rolls his eyes when I take pics of my own food so I pretty much stopped bothering when we went out together.\n\nMoney has been tight lately because of some medical bills, so I haven't been able to go out to eat with my foodie girls and the infrequent date with my boyfriend is the only chance I get to eat out. I had to sit him down and have a \"Look, just let me enjoy things,\" conversation with him and told him I was gonna take pics of my own food when we went out and could he please just not be immature about it. And since we alternate who pays for dates, I told him I would appreciate it if he could spare the 30 seconds for me to snap a pic of the appetizer + his meal on nights that I was paying, and I got a sort of half-hearted \"do whatever you want\" confirmation.\n\nSunday was my turn to pay, and he let me take a pic of the appetizer with minimal fussing. But then when the entrees came out, I went to snap a pic of his and he messed it up with his fork. Then he reached over and stirred up MY pasta to also ruin the photo of my own meal! I was so pissed off by that that I refused to pay his half at the end of the meal, which pissed him off because he said he wouldn't have ordered a cocktail if he knew that I was gonna skip my turn. He says I owe him one because I don't get to just decide not to pay according to our agreement after we've already ordered.", "created_utc": 1684856215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13prznw/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_boyfriends_food/", "score": 1455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He made it clear long ago that he hated this- just leave him and his food alone. Yes, he shouldn\u2019t belittle something you enjoy, but why are you not giving him the same respect of leaving his meal alone when he asked? There is a time and place for our hobbies, and it\u2019s not difficult to have an adult conversation about it- except apparently for the two of you. You either aren\u2019t effectively communicating about your relationship or you\u2019re both just petulantly ignoring the other\u2019s wishes. Also, people who take photos of their food usually take way longer and are way more obnoxious about it than they realize- I seriously have to wonder just how much of your time and attention this is taking away from actually enjoying the company of the person you\u2019re with. You claim it\u2019s minimal- but your boyfriend clearly is sick of it, so you should really examine what kind of impact you are willing to let this hobby have on your actual real life with actual real people who are in front of you.", "NTA but it is time to *dump* the asshole.\n\nNowhere in your post does it indicate that he has talked to you in a mature way about boundaries around food photos.

Him messing with the food on your plate was really disrespectful, though.", "I think I come down on ESH. I feel like if you want to take pictures of your own food, that\u2019s fine, and he definitely shouldn\u2019t have messed up your plate, but his should be off limits whether you pay for it or not.

Expecting him to let you take pictures of his food when it is your turn to pay isn\u2019t fair. You want him to let you enjoy things. He wants the same. Just let him enjoy his meal. If you want to take pictures of his food when you pay, can you agree to not take pictures of your food when he pays? Lots of people find the need to post everything to instagram to be intrusive and detract from the moment. He should not have touched your food and you should not have gone back on your agreement to alternate who pays.", "YTA. You have a double standard. When your BF pays you want to take pics of your food. When you pay you want to take pics of both foods. But your BF doesnt want you to take pics at all.

You take his desire to dig into his own food as something AGAINST you and your preferences. \n\nYou get 50-100% of what you want during these dinners, and he gets 0-50%, which is really zero because he never gets a meal without the camera and the 30-90 second pause.", "ESH. You told him you were going to take pics of your own food, then went to snap a pic of HIS when the entrees came out. You broke your own agreement. I'd be annoyed too if someone kept trying to photograph MY food. He's being petty by messing with yours, as well as ordering extra only when you're paying for it.\n\nYou two need to leave each other's food alone. If he says he doesn't want you to photograph his, respect that.

You for being one of those insufferables who has to take photos of food and him just because. Just EAT.", "ESH.

Him for misbehaving like a petulant toddler instead of using his words and you for being the person who can't enjoy a meal without documenting it for strangers online.

There's no need for you to be taking photos, you're doing that because you want to but honestly, I can see this being massively annoying. You're out to eat with your bf, why are you so concerned about photos of your food? He didn't need to ruin your food but he can do what he wants with his. When he's the one paying does he put terms and conditions on it like you do? I'm going to guess not.

You mention you only stopped taking pics of his food because he kept ruining the photo. How any times did he tell you no and ask you to stop before he reached the point he had to attack his food to keep your from taking pictures of it.

I like to take sometimes photos of my food but I do tell people that then can either wait for a moment or just eat immediately. For people who want to eat immediately I just take photos of my own food so maybe you can start doing that too.

I've seen people do it and it never just takes 30 seconds and it even annoys the servers. That said he shouldn't have messed up your food and your agreement on who pays for dates should be independent of your pictures. Just put down the camera when with him and enjoy the date. That's what he is asking for. Not to have dinner turned into a photography session. Save that for your foodie friends and please tip your server extra for the time.", "YTA. Let the man eat in peace.  He doesn\u2019t need to let you photograph his food.  I can\u2019t tell you how annoying I would find that.", "NTA. Are you able to enjoy food without photographing it?", "ESH. The second you decided that he can't eat HIS food because you want a picture, you became an AH. He can say no to you taking a picture of what he ordered. Do you take pictures of your food when he pays? It's not a big deal that you take pics of your own food, but that's not what dates are for...\n\nI also think he can be annoyed at you doing this, since going out is meant to be an interaction between the two of you, he's not going to dinner with you so you can spend that time on your phone.\n\nHe shouldn't have ruined your plate, but now he has to pay because you couldn't show it off to your followers who you don't know? IMO, this is just as bad as saying that \"you're a Yelp reviewer\". He also shouldn't associate ordering a drink with whether or not he's paying (not cool), but you changed the conditions after agreeing to pay.\n\nYou both suck. You need to respect his boundaries and he should just let you take your picture, as long as it's not a photo shoot where you adjust the lighting/filters and then try to post it before you take the first bite.", "NTA but you sound exhausting.", "NTA.

You don't HAVE to take a photo of the food, especially his, because like you said; this is just a hobby for you. He also doesn't need to be a jerk and mess up both of your food. How about in future situations, you take a photo of the appetizers and your food ONLY, and tell him you won't take a photo of his since you're respecting his space and privacy. On the other hand like I said, your bf was an AH for messing up both of your food, so I'm gonna say ESH.", "ESH - you are both clearly disrespectful to each other.  Like obviously he was a jerk after he said \"fine do whatever you want\" to not allow you to do whatever you want.\n\nBut honestly, you are too.  You frame it as its just \"something you enjoy\" but the reality is, you're on a date night.  You can't save your hobby with your \\*1,000\\* adoring fans to when you are alone or with like-minded friends?  I mean, to you, it's just snapping a quick photo.  But if I was him, it would sure make me feel like the photo (which I dislike you doing in the first place) is more important to you than the fact you are trying to enjoy a meal together.  \n\nFor goodness sake, enjoy moments occasionally, and not worry about taking a picture of a salad you'll never think twice about again.", "ESH. \n\nThe two of you need a better way to deal with this than you are both currently engaged in.\n\nYour BF hates your hobby, which is fine. Everybody has their own tastes. But intentionally sabotaging your partner's hobby, even if you hate it, is not something you do to somebody you're in a relationship with.\n\nYou know your BF hates your hobby, so you shouldn't make him participate in it. You are 100%  able to have your hobbies on your own time.\n\nIf you don't deal with this better, you are both better off not being in a relationship together.", "\n\"he wouldn't have ordered a cocktail if he knew that I was gonna skip my turn\"\n\nI'm more hung up on this.

He\u2019s handling this in a really immature way, but it\u2019s also reasonable to dislike being expected to wait on a photo before you eat. Maybe it doesn\u2019t feel like a big production to you, but it\u2019s annoying to him. At the very least limiting the photos to just your dish seems very reasonable, regardless of who is paying.\n\nHave you ever tried to have a mature conversation with him about why this bothers him?", "YTA - I hate when someone thinks they need to take a pic of my food before I eat it.  You focus on your food and he wouldn\u2019t tamper with yours.", "Esh what he did was childish but from your post you get upset when he eats his own food before you can take a picture of it which can get very annoying. It seems like this is a reaction to repeated build up of annoyances on your end and you shouldn\u2019t be expecting people to not eat first so you can take photos", "ESH. Rightly or wrongly, you know it annoys him. And I\u2019m going to say his annoyance is both petty and understandable. For transparency, I\u2019m too old for this to be a normal thing for me, and getting your food and then having to stop the flow of the meal, conversation etc while you take pics is not something he enjoys. It\u2019s like answering a text or taking a quick call - it\u2019s disruptive and distracting and considered rude. So too is shifting your focus to your phone, even if it\u2019s brief. \n\nSo, as much as I think he should just let it happen, I also think you should have stuck with not doing it when you go out with him. As easy as it is for him to grin and bear it, it\u2019s just as easy for you to not do it. \n\nHis reaction was of course very childish, and he\u2019s not winning any points from me there. But I think this situation has been devolving for some time and neither of you has really respected the other. You are equal parties in where it has ended up.", "NTA - boyfriend sucks.", "100% NTA for being mad that he messed up your food before you could take a picture, but YTA for being mad that he just wants to eat his food. Leave his food alone. But he's an absolute tool bag for touching your food, if he can't follow the simplest boundary he needs to be tossed to the curb. Soft ESH but mostly NTA.", "ESH. But seriously. Stop taking pictures of HIS food. That should be an agreement you can both agree to. I highly doubt that you snap a quick picture. I\u2019m guessing you have to get the plate just right. Silverware set. Stand up and get a good angle maybe? He likely just wants to go on a date with you and not deal with the situation. But it\u2019s your hobby so work it out. But leave his food alone- even when you pay.", "NTA. He broke the agreement by not letting you take pictures when you were paying, therefore that agreement is nullified and he can pay for his own meal. \n\nIf he is this dismissive and intentionally sabotaging your hobby, there are deeper issues at play that you need to work on", "ESH. this relationship sounds shallow as hell", "You know, I was going to go with E-S-H because your BF messing with your food was really childish and rude, but after reading comment after comment from you, I'm realising exactly why he snapped and did that.\n\n**YTA**\n\nYou keep going on in the comments about how \"it never takes more than 45 seconds\", and defending yourself because of that. But it doesn't matter how long it takes, insisting on taking pictures of someone else's food when they're ready to eat and have specifically asked you not to is super intrusive and obnoxious.\n\nYou're a grown-ass adult literally demanding to play with someone else's food, and justifying it with \"because I paid for it\". But when you treat someone else to a meal, you are not paying for the right to do as you please with their food. That's not how that works.\n\nAnd after reading your unrelenting defensiveness and refusal to understand that in the comments, it is abundantly clear that your boyfriend messed up YOUR food, not because he is an obnoxious child, but to make you understand that YOU are . . . and how it feels when he asks you repeatedly and tells you over and over that he doesn't want you near his food, and you insist on photographing it anyway.", "NTA. \nAnd even though it's petty and this sub is known for its \" you should break up/divorce\" advice, you really should reconsider your relationship. \n\nBecause\n1. It only takes 30 seconds -1 minute of your time to get pictures of both plates. It's pretty harmless. And I imagine that someone that truly likes you, wouldn't mind giving you 30seconds of their time to your hobby. \n\n2. He went back on his word. \nHe could have refused your request before you went to the restaurant. Instead he lied to you. \n\n3. He went ahead to also destroy your own food.

I don't turn meals into a whole photoshoot production when I go out, but I like to snap a few photos of everything as it comes out. I've got about 1000 followers, it's just a hobby for me but I have made friends with some other bloggers and we like to go out and get pics together and try new restaurants. I prefer doing this with my foodie girls because my boyfriend HATES it, and will go out of his way to take a big bite of food or mess up his plate with his fork before I can snap any pics, and he rolls his eyes when I take pics of my own food so I pretty much stopped bothering when we went out together.\n\nMoney has been tight lately because of some medical bills, so I haven't been able to go out to eat with my foodie girls and the infrequent date with my boyfriend is the only chance I get to eat out. I had to sit him down and have a \"Look, just let me enjoy things,\" conversation with him and told him I was gonna take pics of my own food when we went out and could he please just not be immature about it. And since we alternate who pays for dates, I told him I would appreciate it if he could spare the 30 seconds for me to snap a pic of the appetizer + his meal on nights that I was paying, and I got a sort of half-hearted \"do whatever you want\" confirmation.\n\nSunday was my turn to pay, and he let me take a pic of the appetizer with minimal fussing. But then when the entrees came out, I went to snap a pic of his and he messed it up with his fork. Then he reached over and stirred up MY pasta to also ruin the photo of my own meal! I was so pissed off by that that I refused to pay his half at the end of the meal, which pissed him off because he said he wouldn't have ordered a cocktail if he knew that I was gonna skip my turn. He says I owe him one because I don't get to just decide not to pay according to our agreement after we've already ordered.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH", "ESH. I'm guessing that he hates that you are distracted/working on your hobby, when you're on a date with him. I can kind of understand that, ESPECIALLY if you're taking time to 'pose' the photos', then immediately posting the photos, interacting on your phone, etc., during the meal. It's the same thing as using your phone at the table (with other people present) more generally - it can be rude, depending on the situation. Indeed, I wonder if you're distracted with your phone/hobby more generally when you're with him, and this was the last straw. \n\nIf you're only taking a quick photo of your own food (and doing nothing else), it's not so bad. He shouldn't make it a hill to die on, and it's childish of him to mess up the food in response. However, you SHOULD respect that he really doesn't want you taking photos of HIS food - even if you don't agree. It sounds like you've put inappropriate pressure on him to allow you to (using money as justification), when he's already voiced his wishes against. \n\nIt DOES sound a little obnoxious and immature to me, to be basically saying (especially on a supposedly romantic date): 'I'm paying, so I actually own the food you're eating - and can do what I want with it'. You're trying to use money to control and override his wishes. And yes, you might be paying on that occasion - but overall you're both paying equally for food. So no, you don't 'own' his food overall. \n\nEven if you always paid for all the meals, you'd be gifting him the food. It wouldn't mean you automatically get last say in this context, on whatever happens with his food. And he could make the same argument - that when he pays for YOUR food, he 'owns' it. So he gets to tell you that you're not allowed to take photos of YOUR food, on those occasions. And why are you making this such a hill to die on yourself?! Just take photos of your own food - respect that he doesn't like his own food being photographed. \n\nYou're turning a supposedly romantic date into a controlling fight about who 'owns' the food (and maybe also conflict about divided attention, if you're also posting and commenting at the table). You sound a little childish yourself, quite frankly. Even if him messing up the food was childish, it's also childish to refuse to pay - just because he wouldn't back down and allow something that he clearly finds rude, just because you were trying override/control his wishes on the basis of 'who pays'.", "NTA, at all, because I think you've been super reasonable about expressing what it means to you and asking for minimal respect. \n\nI will add that I find this insufferable when I'm eating out with people and I'm trying to figure out why because it is such a small thing. I think because I feel like we have everything frozen in time for a picture before we can enjoy our food and do anything real, and like I matter as a conversational companion less than the food matters as a pic? A more likely explanation is that I'm just a hangry glutton and want to eat as soon as the food is set down haha!", "Your hobby is frankly super annoying to me (but ultimately harmless) and he's being an ass about it rather than just putting up with someone's quirk.\n\nHe's more the ass in the scenario for deliberately messing with your food. You *don't touch* someone else's food! But I'm going to go ESH because you are also figuratively messing with his food as well (you know he hates the photos and you insist taking pics of his plate before eating. Not your call to make for *his* food).\n\nYou do what you want with your plate and he does what he wants with his. Stop messing with each other, and pay for meals separately if you can't avoid each other's food.", "This is something you enjoy and it sounds like you've communicated about it really clearly and kindly and gone out of your way to not impact your bf.

I fell into the trap a while ago and it took me a second to realize that:\n\n\\- I'm not a professional photographer,\n\n\\- It's never as quick a snap as I expect it to be, and\n\n\\- Now I'm eating food which has cooled down/started melting for...kind of an average photo?\n\nYour call in the end, but sometimes it's more fun to just eat a meal.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, I legitimately don\u2019t get it. If my partner wanted to take photos of our food before we ate, I would grant him the literal 60 seconds of grace that that would take.

I\u2019m not religious, and I don\u2019t personally get anything out of either situation, but I\u2019m willing to give up a literal minute of my life in order to make the people I care about happy. It\u2019s a little annoying if I\u2019m starving, but it\u2019ll probably take that long for the food to cool enough to eat anyways. \n\nOP, I know that funds are tight right now due to medical issues. It seems like you\u2019ve found a little community through this hobby. Is it possible for you to spend your eating out money with your friends, and spend other meaningful time with your boyfriend?

This isn't one time, this is every time.  Boyfriend is expected to just wait there, every time, until OP tells him it's ok to eat his food.  I'd find that infuriating.  It would be one thing to do it to her own food, it's another thing to do it with his food too.  He's being treated like a dog, having to wait until he's told he's allowed to eat his food.

She was very clear he was unhappy with it - but instead of trying to understand his viewpoint, she then upped the ante (on a supposedly romantic date), with a 'control' move. She basically tried to overrule him, by claiming she can do what she wants with HIS food - if she's paying for it (though overall, they're paying equally for food, so she doesn't actually 'own' his food). \n\nThat's all very childish, controlling, and obnoxious. And indeed, he could make the same argument, if she wants to play that card - that when HE pays, HE 'owns' her food. So she's not allowed to photograph HER food, on those occasions. Can you imagine how controlling THAT would sound?! \n\nLike others here, I'm guessing this has been the straw that broke the camel's back for him. Maybe she really does just spend 30 secs taking a photo of the food (or maybe she's underestimating that). But maybe she then posts the photos on the date, begins interacting with followers, etc. The number of 'influencers' /bloggers who do that. \n\nThat could get really irritating, very quickly - as any phone use can get at the dinner table, when you're meant to be paying attention to the person you're with. It's irritating when you sit down, looking forward to seeing/talking to somebody, and they're frequently distracted by their phone. Indeed, maybe divided attention/phone use is a more general issue when they're together. \n\nNo, he shouldn't have messed up the food, which was childish. But it was also childish trying to override his clear wishes (on the basis of who pays), and then not pay her half because he wouldn't submit to her demands. Just respect the dude doesn't like his food photographed/their date interrupted so much. Have some generosity towards that, and stop trying to override his wishes through petty things like who pays.

If it was only his food he messed up he would not be an AH\n\nWhat puts him into AH and her into NTA is because he did agree, did not communicate that agreement had ended and then he ruined her dish as well, and I think in response to that OP was well within her rights to not pay for his dinner. Taking a photo of her food would not affect him but ruining her photo did affect her, so she responded. \n\nThat said there\u2019s a mess of communication and understanding issues in this relationship and she should stop asking to take photos of his food", "Nah.

I\u2019ve never met someone so vehemently against food photography \ud83d\ude02", "I dunno man. If it makes your partner happy, what\u2019s the big deal?", "The other thing is that he ordered a cocktail when it was her turn to pay making the bill more expensive. Something he wouldn't have done if it was his turn to pay.", "Sometimes things don't warrant counter arguments.", "I\u2019m just not believing that it only takes her 15 seconds to snap the pic and that\u2019s all.", "Why can't you believe him when he tells you he hates that you take pics of his food? Why keep asking to do it? Why take the picture anyway regardless of what he says? Why keep fighting about it? *Functioning?*", "Just because someone doesn't take a pic of their food/drinks, doesn't mean they deserve less.\n\nAnyway you shake it, that is what you're saying.", "It does seem to be triggering me to an unhealthy degree, doesn't it? I'm gonna sit this one out, I think, since I clearly have nothing new or constructive to add.", "Again it depends on what theyre doing. 30 second photos vs 10 mins photos.\n\nI think it\u2019s have bigger issues if my partner needed to stage everything at a restaurant to begin with.", "Right? If it makes your partner happy to not have their meal photographed, why not just do it? It would literally take zero seconds.", "If a regular likes IPAs, and we get a new one on tap, and I offer them a sample, would you complain that I did not also offer you a sample? By your logic, I should offer ever single customer the exact same service. I prefer to tailor mine to the needs of my guests. We often go above and beyond for people we know things about, and it doesn\u2019t detract from what other customers receive at all. Just because someone else receives more doesn\u2019t mean you received any *less*", "You\u2019re obviously a proponent of equality, but in my industry, equity serves better.", "Your time would be better spent lobbying against food photography in your community. Be the change you want to see in the world!", "Sure but the OP specifically said they keep picture taking short, and for the most part, we take what OP says at face value in these things unless there\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t seem credible.", "You think OPs partner takes active delight in NOT having their food photographed? Absence of anger is not the same thing as happiness."]}
