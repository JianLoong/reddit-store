We had a significant snowstorm yesterday, and he was home all day because school was cancelled. All winter, he has never lifted a finger when it comes to cleaning up snow on his end in a mindful fashion. He also parks his car directly next to mine even though there is space for another vehicle or two in the leftover space to the left, but he leaves those spots open so that when his girlfriend visits, she has a place to park.\n\nI worked from home and during my lunch, I was out there cleaning off about 7\" of snow off my car, around my car, and ensuring that the space where I walk (my driver's side, his passenger's side) to get to my car was absolutely clear of snow so I didn't have to step in it or it didn't ice over. We got more snow overnight for another 3\", so this morning at 6am before my work day began, I was out there, cleaning up my steps, car, and again shoveling the driveway area around my car as well as all the snow that was pushed off my car onto my driveway to make sure the path was clear all around it and between his car and mine. I did more than enough to clear the area around his car as well.\n\nThis guy did not step out once yesterday to clean up his car or driveway area. He was upstairs all day playing his video games until his girlfriend came over in the evening, and she stayed overnight. School had a delayed start today, but he didn't bother going outside earlier before leaving to clean off his car or shovel any snow around it. He simply shoved all the snow off his car right before he had to leave for work, and it all got dumped in the space between his car and my driver's side. Several inches of snow. This isn't the first time he's done over the winter. He's left huge chunks of ice scraped off his windshield right in that area atop of snow, for example, and because we got so much snow yesterday, it was a mess.\n\nI ended up going outside once again, but instead of shoveling the snow neatly away off to the side, I simply pushed it right over his parking spot and am leaving it there for him to deal with when he gets back from work.

Most people do what your neighbor does - the snow comes off the car and lands wherever it lands. Especially in a rental situation, like outdoor parking at an apartment building for example, I would expect the landlord to have a snow service to clean the parking lot, not the people driving. I actually just step through the snow to get in the car when this situation arises and that\u2019s pretty much what I see others do too. Now I live in a house I own and I clear the driveway as an additional chore because it\u2019s my driveway and I don\u2019t want ice but I\u2019m not likely to bother if I\u2019m in a public space.

I can't simply just scrape a section big enough for my car because he undoes what I clear by dumping his snow right onto it when he rushes out the door for work, and doesn't take any consideration into cleaning up what he pushes off his car. I'm getting stuck having to clean up that area twice -- clearing up \\*his\\* snow that he should be responsible for.", "We live in New England, and normally around here, if you get 10\" of snow, you're not going to wait until it's all over and until you have to go somewhere to clear what you can. You're going to get a round in when it's not completely piled on, especially like yesterday where the snow was wet and heavy, and then do the rest when it's over to make it not so hard on yourself.\n\nWe do not have people who come and clean in between the cars. That's up to us to do. The only part my landlord's team will take care of is the main parts of the driveway. If you throw 10\" off your roof, hood, trunk, windows, etc. to the sides of the car, that just leaves 10\" of snow all around the side of your car that you now need to shovel out of the way in order to step into your car and not get stuck under your tires/under your car as you drive out.

I don't think he'll ever learn really. He's just lazy. FWIW, I work from home half the week, and I've observed that his mom comes over during the daytime to clean his apartment for him.\n\nCan't believe this grown ass adult guy has an attractive girlfriend...", "Are you able to back into your parking spot?

Still managed to do it, though. Not sure what this has to do with you or why you have an issue with it.\n\nBut to the other point, since you don't have people going around cleaning out the parking spot, in between them, etc, then yeah he should have cleaned out the area between your cars.\n\nAs for under the car, as long as the cars can get in and out, I don't see any issue with leaving snow there.\n\nAs a resident of New England, sometimes weather is bad and parking on top of packed down snow is the only option.

If he wants to wait until the storm is over and then clean it off with more effort, fine, but it's so very obvious that he has no self-awareness or common courtesy towards his neighbors in regards to making a whole new mess for me when -- as other commenters have stated -- it's obvious the area has been cleaned for a reason, and he should be respectful of that space. His method of clearing snow creates more work for me, and it's inexcusable. It's no different than a neighbor shoveling or snowblowing snow off their side of the sidewalk and throwing it onto their next door neighbor's cleaned up sidewalk. You're supposed to take that snow and push it into a neutral zone that doesn't negatively impact other's cleared out areas.", ">but the way he literally waits until he has to actually go somewhere and then hastily dumps all the snow/scrapes off all the huge chunks of ice around the car\n\nThis is not the problem. \n\n> without bothering to clean it every single time is the problem. \n\nThis is.\n\nI agree with the rest of what you've said.", "NTA - Have you said anything to him about the snow issues?

Can you back into your space so he doesn't get the snow where you get into your car?", "He just got home and I checked to see where he parked. He parked right over the snow in his spot as usual.

You suck because you spent 99% of the post complaining about stuff that has nothing to do with you. He can leave snow on his car as long as he wants and he can clean it at the last minute if he wants. Why are you paying attention to his schedule and complaining about him playing video games?", "NTA.  Omg...I had a neighbor who started to  throw all the snow from their car behind my car after I had spent hours cleaning out my space. Some snow was landing on my car.  I went outside, asked them to stop, and they wouldn't.  So the next few shovels they threw by my car, I threw the snow back on their car.  They actually tried to say I had a problem so I pointed out how lazy and rude they were being. Eventually they stopped. \n\nTHEN, after I went out to the store,  I get home and find ANOTHER neighbor had put rope and lawn chairs in the space that I had cleared!!!  I got out of my car,  tossed the chairs and ropes into the snowbank, and pulled in the space I cleared.  This neighbor had the nerve to yell at me that they had the space saved, so I pointed out next time they needed to actually clear the space to claim it.   \n\nPeople are insane!!!!", "From the way you describe the story I can\u2019t tell if you live in a country with the steering wheel on the left or right and back in or pull straight in to your driveway.
