About 5 years ago my in laws house burned down in the fires in CA so they had to move back into their house. We all lived together fine for the most part but 2 years ago I had gotten pregnant and my husband and I decided to buy the house from my in laws. When we were in the process of buying it and planning on gutting the whole house and putting in new floors and a new kitchen. I told my in-laws that there were going to be some changes in Cleanliness (my MIL did all the cleaning.. it was her choice and as it was her house I didn\u2019t say anything) including but not limited to not wearing shoes in the house especially since we were about to have a baby. For an entire year I was telling them this so when the time came to start taking shoes off they were not surprised. My FIL REFUSED to remove his shoes in the house. I asked him several time to do so. He still didn\u2019t do it. So I got some of those blue booties to wear in the house so he wouldn\u2019t have to take off his shoes and he also refused to do that. It got to the point where every time he walked through the house he would stomp super loud and wake up my son just to be an ass.  I got so fed up one day that I called him and asked him nicely why he won\u2019t take his shoes off and he said \u201cI do take my shoes off when I get to my bedroom because that\u2019s what normal people do. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be\u201d I was so pissed off that i went off on him. I said I dont give a flying fuck about what \u201cnormal people\u201d do in their own homes.. this isn\u2019t your house anymore and we don\u2019t want your nasty fucking shoes on our nice new floor or where our son is going to be playing\u201d he again repeated that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be I said \u201cyeah? Well then you are not welcome at my house anymore unless you can be an adult and respect my boundaries\u201d they had already got a new place and were about to move out anyway in a few months. He threw a fit and called everyone and told them I kicked him out. Now everyone except my husband who also hates shoes in the house is mad at me because I \u201ctook it to far\u201d and I am \u201coverreacting\u201d and \u201ccausing a rift between my husband and his dad\u201d I feel like the only person who caused the rift is my FIL because he refused to acknowledge the rule. He has not been back to my house since. So\u2026 AITA? \n\n\nTLDR: We bought a house from my in-laws and my FIL refused to acknowledge the \u201cno shoes\u201d inside rule so I told him he wasn\u2019t welcome at my house anymore.

You're NTA but FIL is TA for not following your rules.", "NTA. He wanted a power struggle and he lost.  It\u2019s not his house anymore and is mad about that. You did the right thing.

You didn't take it too far. You are standing firm on your boundaries, protecting your house from unnecessary grime, and most importantly protecting your future child.", "Nta.

I just vacuum after they leave.", "Wait did you buy the house or are you renting it, and why is renting in quotes?", "Ok, I don\u2019t understand why the shoes have to come off at the door. I kick mine off when I get home simply because I\u2019m ready to get out of them. My grandkids come in & maybe if they are going to lay on couch, they will kick them off. Unless you work in a greasy garage, HOW are shoes dirtier than your dog? Crazy world!", "It\u2019s hard to change people.  Have you thought about getting him a nice pair of \u201chouse shoes\u201d, ie., usually goos slippers?  Some people really don\u2019t like to go shoeless, there are acceptable compromises.  So ESH by being stubborn and unable to compromise.", "YTA. If you care about the spouse, you'd care about the inlaws. Where is your respect for your elders??? Seriously.
