About 5 years ago my in laws house burned down in the fires in CA so they had to move back into their house. We all lived together fine for the most part but 2 years ago I had gotten pregnant and my husband and I decided to buy the house from my in laws. When we were in the process of buying it and planning on gutting the whole house and putting in new floors and a new kitchen. I told my in-laws that there were going to be some changes in Cleanliness (my MIL did all the cleaning.. it was her choice and as it was her house I didn\u2019t say anything) including but not limited to not wearing shoes in the house especially since we were about to have a baby. For an entire year I was telling them this so when the time came to start taking shoes off they were not surprised. My FIL REFUSED to remove his shoes in the house. I asked him several time to do so. He still didn\u2019t do it. So I got some of those blue booties to wear in the house so he wouldn\u2019t have to take off his shoes and he also refused to do that. It got to the point where every time he walked through the house he would stomp super loud and wake up my son just to be an ass.  I got so fed up one day that I called him and asked him nicely why he won\u2019t take his shoes off and he said \u201cI do take my shoes off when I get to my bedroom because that\u2019s what normal people do. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be\u201d I was so pissed off that i went off on him. I said I dont give a flying fuck about what \u201cnormal people\u201d do in their own homes.. this isn\u2019t your house anymore and we don\u2019t want your nasty fucking shoes on our nice new floor or where our son is going to be playing\u201d he again repeated that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be I said \u201cyeah? Well then you are not welcome at my house anymore unless you can be an adult and respect my boundaries\u201d they had already got a new place and were about to move out anyway in a few months. He threw a fit and called everyone and told them I kicked him out. Now everyone except my husband who also hates shoes in the house is mad at me because I \u201ctook it to far\u201d and I am \u201coverreacting\u201d and \u201ccausing a rift between my husband and his dad\u201d I feel like the only person who caused the rift is my FIL because he refused to acknowledge the rule. He has not been back to my house since. So\u2026 AITA? \n\n\nTLDR: We bought a house from my in-laws and my FIL refused to acknowledge the \u201cno shoes\u201d inside rule so I told him he wasn\u2019t welcome at my house anymore.

I'm guessing that you are from the USA since FIL said \"normal\" people remove their shoes in their bedroom.\n\nI'm from Sweden and we always take off our shoes indoors since it will make the house dirty and it would be disrespectful to keep them on if you are visiting someone. There is nothing wrong with it and I would say it's better especially if you are going to have a child playing on the floor.", "NTA but this isn't your fight.  It's your husbands.  Always better if the child sets boundaries with the family so you, in this case, can't be cast in a negative light.  Which is what they are doing.\n\nAsk your husband to take over this fight.  He agrees with you.", "NTA. Your House , Your Rules.. If FIL wasn't willing to respect them, he shouldn't have sold the House to you in the first place.", "NTA. Your FIL is trying to power trip all over you and you shut it down. Let them cry wolf to everyone who will listen. They either know how your FIL is and won't believe him, or love drama and spite and that makes their opinions worthless anyway.\n\nAlso, your husband needs to step up and deal with *his* dad. I had an issue where my FIL was missing the toilet when he was using our bathroom. I told my husband that he needed to clean up after his dad because that was disgusting and I was not going to do it. Your husband should not only be calling out his own dad, but he should be mopping up after him.", "I am. From Canada, and most families that I have known take their shoes off when they enter a home, especially if the weather's bad. Your FiL is being an ass, and if he cab't do this very reasonable thing, then you are probably better off with him not entering your home.

I am sure they won\u2019t lol. \n\nAlso your husband should step forward and not make you the escape goat for this stance. It will be much more \u201caccepted\u201d if it comes from his own child.

I honestly thought all the people on TV leaving their shoes on were doing so because they were on a stage floor, not a house.  Apparently that's not the case.", "NTA.  YOUR house, YOUR rules.  Simple as that.  FIL has control issues.", "NTA. Lots of cultures and communities remove shoes at the door for various reasons.  Most people in those communities  also have \"HOUSE\" shoes that are for inside the house only. \n\nIt has occurred to me that maybe your FIL doesn't like the way his feet look and is embarrassed.  For example, toenail fungus, athlete's foot or any of another million reasons.   \n\nMaybe suggest the house shoes (slippers) as an alternative.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA-we have a no shoes policy at our house and some \u201cfriends\u201d who refused, their son tracked in poop. Not fun. They were not apologetic at all either. Their house has super dirty carpet so I think they feel it\u2019s normal. We have indoor slippers once we get in the house and take off our outside shoes. Just the clean thing to do.", "NTA - We've been no shoes inside for 35 years, and luckily never had anybody be childish about it.", "NTA. It's your house.\n\nI just moved into a townhome. My staircase and upstairs bedrooms are carpet, while the upstairs bathroom, hall, and all of downstairs is tile. And guess what? No shoes are allowed upstairs. The only exception I made was when I had cheap movers bring in furniture. \n\nEveryone is fine with it. Those that aren't are not welcomed.", "NTA. (Although sounds like you maybe went over the top a bit with the cursing.) I am a no shoes in the house person and my in laws refuse. Drives us nuts but they live far away and only visit once or twice a year, so I deal with it. But if they lived anywhere near me, I told my husband I would have each of them choose a pair of shoes that they would wear only while in my house.", "He's probably pissed off that you changed *his*  house . That was one of the major reasons why I vetoed buying my in-laws house. (The other one being that there was no employment there for my husband.) I knew that if we so much as changed a light fixture that my mother-in-law would pitch a cat-haired fit that you could hear in Tokyo.", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.", "NTA.  Your FIL disrespected your rules in your house multiple times.  As for the rest of the family putting their noses and opinions in, I would tell them to duck off.", "NTA. It\u2019s not his house, it\u2019s not his money that was spent on remodelling, and it\u2019s not his baby who will be crawling everywhere.", "NTA your house your rules.", "NTA. I don\u2019t take my shoes off either but I don\u2019t go into the homes of people who insist upon it. I would use those little blue booties if they had grips on the bottom to prevent sliding. Demanding that people take their shoes off is still relatively new to the US. I don\u2019t recall anybody requiring that in the 90s outside of Asian folks in Hawaii and some farms.  Note: I have feet problems and must walk with my shoes.", "NTA.  Your house,your rules. Especially w a baby where cleanliness must be the rule. Your fil sounds like an ah who thinks the place is still his. Personally,I always take my shoes off in the house.", "We bought a house with hardwood floors, and we have always required everyone to take their shoes off.  Shoes go through all kinds of gross stuff, who wants that inside?  When our first kid was born, people were also required to wash hands as soon as they arrived, and that was way before covid.  You're NTA but FIL is TA for not following your rules.", "NTA. He wanted a power struggle and he lost.  It\u2019s not his house anymore and is mad about that. You did the right thing. If he acts this way about shoes imagine how he isn\u2019t going to do what you want with a baby. No respect for you, your husband or house.", "NTA, this is about his complete disrespect for you. Stomping around like a child? Because of a house rule? Gtfoh.", "I\u2019m Canadian and I\u2019ve never understood the concept of wearing outdoor shoes indoors, even worse it your floors are covered in carpet! Just boggles my mind!  NTA, your FIL is especially acting quite immature stomping around and waking your child like that.", "NTA. Your house, your rules.", "NTA and most people take their shoes off when they come inside", "NTA BUT WHY DO AMERICANS WEAR THEIR DAMN SHOES IN THE HOUSE?! IT\u2019S NASTY AND SO WEIRD!!", "NTA. It's disgusting to track dirt and god knows what else all over the house, and it's dangerous for the baby because the baby will be near the floor (even if you put a blanket down first, it's not safe for the child). \n\nHe needs to respect your boundaries and act like an adult, not a whiny child. You didn't take it too far. You are standing firm on your boundaries, protecting your house from unnecessary grime, and most importantly protecting your future child.", "Nta.  We started a no shoes in the house rule when we had a baby.  My FIL, who is giant misogynistic a-hole, even obeyed the rules.  You\u2019re looking out for the health of your baby (who will be face level with whatever he tracks in) and the cleanliness of your home.  Your FIL is an AH for not realizing that.", "NTA. Your house your rules. I also don't allow any shoes on my floors. It's disgusting to drag dirt in from outside onto my clean rugs. Yuck.", "ESH.  My wife and I do the no shows in the house but growing up I wore shoes in the house.   My parents are in their 70\u2019s so it hard for them to take their shoes on and off so when they come over it\u2019s a battle not worth getting into.   I just vacuum after they leave.", "Wait did you buy the house or are you renting it, and why is renting in quotes?", "Ok, I don\u2019t understand why the shoes have to come off at the door. I kick mine off when I get home simply because I\u2019m ready to get out of them. My grandkids come in & maybe if they are going to lay on couch, they will kick them off. Unless you work in a greasy garage, HOW are shoes dirtier than your dog? Crazy world!", "It\u2019s hard to change people.  Have you thought about getting him a nice pair of \u201chouse shoes\u201d, ie., usually goos slippers?  Some people really don\u2019t like to go shoeless, there are acceptable compromises.  So ESH by being stubborn and unable to compromise.", "YTA. If you care about the spouse, you'd care about the inlaws. Where is your respect for your elders??? Seriously. It could be a comfort thing for them. Not to mention their freaking house burned down. Do you think they want to stay with you??? But you're holding that over their head.
