I have a niece who is 7, we'll call her Jess. And my partner has a niece who is 5, we'll call her Ava. Jess is painfully shy. She has cried through every single school function she's been in, hates having her photo taken, and takes a long time to warm up to people. So, when we picked our flower girl the obvious choice was Ava. And that seemed fine, until a few weeks ago. Now, Jess is becoming jealous. Ava was practicing the other day, and she tried to rip the basket out of her hands and we had to seperate them. She keeps complaining about how Ava gets a dress with a bow, and called her \"a stupid baby\". \n\n\n\nJess's mother is mad at me now, saying that I shouldn't have based my decision off Jess's previous actions, and that I should let her be my flower girl because she \"wants to be one so very bad\". When I said that I'm not changing my mind so close to the wedding, she said that my favortism is showing. I'm not trying to play favourites, I just thought that Jess would be miserable in that particular situation. I had no idea that this would be such a big deal.\n\n\n\n\nAITA for my choice of flower girl?", "created_utc": 1701887574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18canm5/aita_for_only_picking_one_of_my_nieces_to_be_my/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d tell her she can also be a flower girl if she wants to, she can have a pretty dress with a bow, and she can walk down the aisle with Ava.

She might very well panic when it's a room full of people and not just the few there rehearsing. \n\nCan you give her another job that lets her wear a fancy dress?  Perhaps she could man the table where the guest book is.  She could have her mother/another relative with her as support, and you can convince a 7 year old that it is beyond important that everyone sign there name.  Practice how to ask someone to sign the book.  She may not be able to do anything but hide behind her mom, but she will have had a job and that will mean the world to her.\n\nI was a painfully shy child.

You made this decision partially to protect Jess from her own embarrassment/crying in public.  It's not your fault she can't handle being in public functions.\n\nBTW, you could have had both of them be flower girls.  I've been to multiple weddings where they have more than one. But it's your wedding so if that wouldn't have fit your aesthetic, then that by itself makes you not the AH.", "NTA.  You selected a flower girl based on who you thought could best do it.   This wasn\u2019t selecting who you love more!  Jess reacting the way she did, is on her parents not you.

Have the parents get the dress etc. \n\nYou thought you were considerate, but she\u2019s 7. All she sees is another girl chosen over her. \n\nSo she acted out.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you offer something like she wears a dress and holds your bouquet til it\u2019s time to go, or she could help grandma to her seat and wear the dress etc?

And they can buy the dress and the shoes and if the little girl has a panic attack at showtime, as her history has shown her to be very likely to do\u2026well, the crying little girl will be promptly escorted to a quiet room with a solid door away from the ceremony where she will disturb *no one*. \n\nAnd make it clear that your wedding will not be delayed by one minute if Jess is hesitant at a crucial moment. If Jess wants to be a flower so very very much, you will let her,  *if*, and only if she plays her role as required. \n\nNTA and drama like this is why some people just elope.

Jess\u2019s mother should\u2019ve been mature enough to understand and the excuse \u201cbased on past actions\u201d makes no sense. You can\u2019t pick based on future actions! And how many flower girls do you need? This is YOUR wedding and you can do what you want. You and fianc\u00e9 should go adopt a raggedy shelter dog and make them the flower girl.", " I\u2019d simply explain that flower girls tend to be younger in age like 5. Maybe that will settle them down.", "NTA. Her attitude may make preparation difficult anyway. But kids just want to feel important. Call her the \u201cFlower Protector\u201d, give her a wand from the dollar store or something. Tell her job is to safely deliver the flowers from the store/flower shop to the basket her cousin is carrying down the aisle. Be dramatic; you guys didn\u2019t even know you needed a Flower Protector but the deliverers cancelled suddenly and someone has to let the birds know they\u2019re flowers for the wedding (by waving the wand) and not to pick up the pretty flowers to carry to their nests. She\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s still learning to process her emotions, so the behavior is probably not mean spirited deep down. Letting her cousin shine, while also being given an \u201cimportant job\u201d is a happy compromise I think.", "NTA.  It's your wedding and you get to choose who is involved.  Also, what kind of message are you sending Jess if you reward her behavior toward Ava.  (Physically stealing things and name-calling is NOT how you get what you want!)", "YTA. You\u2019re putting a lot of blame on a 7 year old, mention you didn\u2019t ask her but told her she wasn\u2019t going to be a flower girl and \u201cthat she seemed the accept it\u201d but didn\u2019t understand what it meant. Of course not she\u2019s 7 - do you think she\u2019s been to a lot of weddings to draw experience from? \n\nAlso she\u2019s your niece - do you even like her? You could have gotten them the same dress but only have Ava do the walk down the aisle if Jess has a history of being shy. You don\u2019t have to do anything but you could have been much more thoughtful of an aunt.\n\nAlso, you say \u201cthe obvious choice was Ava\u201d like there\u2019s only the possibility of one flower girl. There\u2019s no rules, you can have no flower girls or a dozen. Picking one and excluding the other is an asshole move.", "YTA. She is 7 years old. She is a small child. This is extremely normal behavior (not to mention  predictable--honestly, you should have seen this coming).\n\nLet her have a pretty dress and a little basket of flower petals or whatever. If she gets cold feet and can't do the flower girl thing when the time comes, no one needs to force it because the other kid will have it covered. But this way, she gets to be included and have a good social learning opportunity. \n\nYou could be kind and generous, but you're taking a hard line stance with a little child. YTA", "ESH   Why is the 7 year old at a practice ??", "NTA\n\nThis is natural consequences", "Info: I'm kinda confused but when and how did the conversation actually go when you communicated with Jess and asked her if you wanted to be a flower girl? I'm assuming you weren't so dismissive and disrespectful to your niece that you completely disregarded her opinion and thoughts to make a decision regarding her place in your life without her input. Having her response during that conversation, will help a lot with trying to figure out what's going on.\nI've spent the vast majority of my life around kids and one thing I can tell you is kids aren't half as stupid as adults like to believe they are and even though they might not be able to express it, they think and analyze just as much as adults.", "NTA \n\nYou do have a problem on your hands though as you don't want Jess and her Mom's feelings hurt for a long time.  I come from a large family and can not have everyone in the bridal party so we have come up with duties that make the other kids special. \n\nOne idea is that she can dress really pretty and hand out the programs before the ceremony this places her up front and special.\n\nOr she can stand at a table (with or without someone else) at the reception with the Guest Book and welcome people and ask them to sign the guest book.  At one family wedding we had 3 little girls share that duty and they loved it. \n\nAt stake here is the child not feeling as important and when we love them we don't want to hurt them.", "Ok a seven year old is old enough to talk to about this. Nta but it would be good if you tried.  \n\nTell her the truth:  that you thought she wouldn\u2019t like it because she is very shy. \n\nThen listen- is it just the dress she wants? Is the fact that Ava is so much younger ( 2 years is a long time when you are seven!)\n\nSee what she is upset about.  I know this seems silly with all the wedding prep-  but can you take an hour to sort this out?", "YTA.\n\nNot the biggest one, but since children are involved, you should have done better. Asked Jess, used them both, etc.\n\nBut really this situation begs for problem solving, not judgment. Wedding miscalculations like this tend to spiral out of control and overshadow the day, so stop worrying about if you were justified and start figuring out how to solve this. If you don't want to add another flower girl, find a special post for Jess suited to her strengths. Make her your bouquet holding and-tossing assistant or cake assistant, have her escort an elderly relative down the aisle so she feels like she is part of the ceremony, have her walk your dog down the aisle, or whatever.", "NTA Its your wedding you do what you want and everyone needs to understand that! You aren't obligated to have anyone in your wedding", "NTA and u were correct in making your choice based off her previous behavior", "No, you're NTA. You get to pick who's in the wedding party, based on how you want the ceremony to go. You have no obligation to pick certain people.", "NTA but you should have see that coming, they are little children, is really obvious that Jess would  be jealous of her cousin. \n\nMy sugesti\u00f3n here is, if you want, give her a small role in your wedding, that way she could wear a pretty dress and feel important too.", "In the comments, you said Jess's mom said Jess doesn't have to apologize to Ava.\n\nI think the tantrum and her mother's response to it are the clinchers that show you made the correct decision.\n\nNTA.", "NAH.  Jess is 7.  She may be shy but maybe she wants to try.  Does it invalidate your wedding if Jess wants the title but doesn't follow through and walk down the aisle.  I had my 2 nieces as flower girls, one walked the other had her mom carry her down the aisle.   Her mom, one of my attendants, held her the entire time.  I have some cute pictures of it.  My mom had 3 flower girls all under the age of 5.  One had just turned 2.  My mom still laughs about it. It was like herding cats.  Tell your sister to buy her the dress that way it won't cost you anything.  Let her participate as much as she wants.  If she ends up sitting somewhere else during the whole ceremony- big deal. You have a flower girl up for the task.  It is a small kindness in a world that isn't kind.", "YTA. Make both girls flower girls, buy them matching dresses and do their hair and makeup the same. Make them as close to identical as you can. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to unless you can't go to a shoppe and find 2 matching dresses. Which you can.", "Ehh... NTA, but.... You can do what you want with your wedding, so you're not the asshole, but this was so entirely predictable that I'm surprised their mother agreed in the first place. of course Jess is jealous and is acting like an angry seven year old. Children are, you know, childish. You skipped over the older child and went to the younger when you could just as easily have had both be flower girls. If Jess had found it too much, you would still have had a flower girl. I can't help but think that their mother is right and there's some favoritism here. That being said, she agreed to this plan that had 'this is going to work out poorly' written all over it, so she really can't say much. You're both at fault for not thinking about how this would look to the kids and make Jess feel in a realistic way. Make both of them flower girls and avoid damaging the relationship between sisters, which is far more important than sticking with your plan.", "Wrong question. For that easy N T A, it's your wedding.\n\nBut honestly, do you not think you could maybe see the side of a disappointed 7 year old?\n\nShe's seven, of course she's hurt, and she will remember this forever. Did you put any effort into thinking of another way of including her in the wedding?", "YTA and so is everyone else who has these stupid flower girl arguments. You should've asked them both", "YTA but not a total. Both girls should have been asked.", "YTA", "NTA it's your choice and I understand why you made it.  That said, could you create another non-public role for Jess?  Could she be your special helper on the wedding day or something like that?  Arrange a special photo of just you and her?  Then she won't feel left out, but also won't cry through the whole ceremony.", "Have 2 flower girls", "Just make both of them a flower girl? Is it that deep?", "Yta. You are judging a five year old.", "NAH.  I get it.  The wedding is around the corner and you're stressing and now you got people complaining about a flower girl.  Any chance you can just get her a comparable dress, bows, etc. and send her down the aisle with Ava?   Just have both of them do it.  If Jess bails out at the last minute, no harm, no foul.", "YTA .   Did you ask her?  Maybe let them both be flower girls? It doesnt have to be one.  She probably would of felt a little more comfortable knowing she wouldnt be alone. They are just walking their little selves down the aisle throwing flowers for a few minutes its nothing too serious to exclude 1 child. It wouldnt ruin your wedding.", "NTA. Your wedding your choice! But\u2026 I feel like you could have predicted there would be tension here over this decision. Is there a background job you could give Jess? Tell her it\u2019s her job to make sure all the bridesmaids have their flowers. Give her a little clipboard or something idk.", "NTA. \n\nJess is only acting this way because she is jealous. Guaranteed if you changed your mind, she would freeze up and cry the day of and potentially ruin the ceremony. \n7 years olds do not understand pressure or expectations until they are physically in that moment. She simply wants this now because another child has it, not because she's now suddenly capable and no longer shy. \n\nAgain, NTA. It's your wedding day, it's your choice. You chose to have 1 flower girl, not 2, and it would hurt Ava dearly if you changed your mind. \nJess' Mom is only upset because her daughter is upset. That is not your responsibility. \n\nGo have a good wedding, OP!", "> I shouldn't have based my decision off Jess's previous actions,\n\nNo, you should base it on her current actions. She is jealous, aggressive and complaining. \n\nNTA", "There are many things i \"want to be so very badly\". Because i was raised with home training, I understand i do t get everything i want just because i want it, and that its not appropriate to be a little stinker to others bc im jealous.\n\nThey didnt suddenly teach me that when i turned 24, they started when i was little. Jess' mom needs to focus more on the fact her daughters assaulting a 5 year old, calling her names, and behaving badly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would also not choose the painfully shy, crying child to walk down an aisle solo with everybody in a church staring at her. My guess is that Jess doesn't quite understand the social horror of being a flower girl -- just understands that it's pretty and important and that she wants what her cousin has. Put in that situation, expected to perform in that way, would be terrifying for a small child.\n\nThat all said, you do have to know that no matter how kind and valid your intentions, it *does* look like favoritism to Jess and that she'll remember her cousin being chosen over her. I'm really not fussed about what the mom thinks and you don't have to consider her feelings on the matter in this -- only Jess' and Ava's count.\n\nIf you wanted to really do something cute, you can have Ava be the flower girl and then have Jess be the Flower Girl's Assistant. If the day comes, Jess is dressed prettily, and she feels confident enough to walk down the aisle with her cousin, then that will be an absolutely adorable photo op for both of them *and* a memorable experience for both cousins. If she backs out at the last minute, no problem, because Jess was the intended flower girl all along and will be prepared to walk the aisle alone. Everybody wins.", "YTA\n\nYour wedding, your choice - but it doesn't change the fact that you hurt Jess' feelings and don't seem to care or have any desire to try and make it up to her.", "NTA \n\nWhen applying for a job your resume is reviewed to see if you\u2019re a fit for the job. \n\nUnfortunately, Jess\u2019 resume is not a good fit for this role. The job of flower girl would put her in a situation she has proven she struggles with. A wedding is not the place or time to allow her to gain additional experience. \n\nIf Jess is truly only upset that the flower girl gets a dress with a bow then all her dreams can still come true! Maybe she can wear a dress with a bow of her choosing to your wedding.", "YTA. Let her be a flower girl fer crissake. If she's too shy in the moment, then she can choose to hang back, no harm, no foul. If she panics, pees herself, and has a meltdown in the middle of the ceremony, boo hoo, who cares. And you'll be able to grab the mic at the reception and say I told you so.", "NTA. I can see why she might be upset, but it\u2019s not worth the risk of her crying through your ceremony and photos.", "NTA, but I would just try to keep the peace and let them both be flower girls, my uncle got married and they chose my aunt\u2019s niece from her side to be the flower girl and I was the \u201cbell girl\u201d (like wtf is that) it hurt my feelings so bad when I was like 6. Did I get over it eventually? Of course, so yes everyone will forget about it and it won\u2019t matter who walked down the aisle once y\u2019all are married anyway.\n\nI agree with others that her behavior was unacceptable, but if she wants to be a flower girl so bad and your sister (or SIL) doesn\u2019t think her past actions will effect her walking down the aisle then tell her to buy a matching dress to Ava\u2019s and they can both walk down the aisle, then day of Jess will probably get cold feet and chicken out anyway. If she doesn\u2019t then maybe this experience can give her confidence to be in front of people more.", "YTA I really think it would be very little hassle to include her. If she gets cold feet on the day, so what! It's not going to ruin your entire day, everyone knows kids will be kids FFS. Family before perfection.", "Tell Jess\u2019s mother that she was not chosen because she is not well-behaved enough to be a flower-girl, and her recent tantrums prove it, and say you will understand if the mother decides not to attend and not hold it against them.", "She's literally showing why she wasn't picked to be flower girl. If you didn't like her and were doing it off of that, I would say Y T A. \n\nBut you're genuinely doing it based off of past experience with her, and she won't behave. nta", "NTA it\u2019s your choice who you have in your wedding party. It\u2019s your wedding - not Jess\u2019 or her mum\u2019s wedding. Your choice was Ava who doesn\u2019t react to being in the spotlight in a negative way. People need to wake up and realise that not every child has to be chosen for an event, get a participation award or be rewarded for acting like a brat. Big feelings from a little girl doesn\u2019t mean physicality is ok.", "NTA.  Your wedding so you can choose whoever you want.  You chose based on displayed behaviour which is perfectly fine.", "NTA. Sometimes life stinks and that\u2019s the way it goes. I honestly would\u2019ve just had them both as flower girls if the one didn\u2019t want to do it because of being shy then be like ok and wouldn\u2019t hear a thing. I think the fact they are rude when this is a happy time is very unfair to you 2. I\u2019m sorry people stinks.", "NTA. You seem to have a better handle on Jess's social abilities than her mom does. Maybe you can let her do something that could be dropped without any major consequences to the ceremony. Maybe take your bouquet from the MOH? Walk in with your mom? Jess can have a pretty dress and a bow. No laws against that. Tell her  mom to start shopping.  Keep these 2 girls apart until after the wedding ceremony.", "NTA but you could still give her a job to make her feel special and included. No one likes to feel left out- let her keep the guest book or help serve cake. Buy her a special outfit just for the wedding", "NTA for thinking she wouldn\u2019t want to be a flower girl - however I\u2019m guessing Jess wasn\u2019t actually asked if she wanted to be a flower girl or  included somehow? She\u2019s 7 she\u2019s gonna remember being excluded but unless you told her why she\u2019s not going to understand why you didn\u2019t ask her. -\n\nSome ideas-\n\nWould it be possible to include her in some way? Even if it\u2019s just helping you get ready?  is it possible have them both be flower girls? Maybe get her a matching dress to Ava or a similar dress that has a bow? \nJess seems jealous of the dress at minimum to as much as that she was excluded and being shy doesn\u2019t mean she would not want to be included with the wedding. It\u2019s still a month off at least depending which part of the month it\u2019s in. Ask her if she wants to be a part it in some way or if she just wants a dress with a bow\u2026", "Hm. Soft YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t punish your niece for her moms parenting limitations, help her! You could have avoided this entirely, I think. But since you didn\u2019t (everyone makes mistakes), in one swift move you could teach her accountability, validate her feelings and worth, show her a different way of communicating her feelings, and come up with a creative solution that met her need to not feel overlooked and ashamed while simultaneously communicating your care for her as a little human being, *not a potential prop or complication for your big day or an avatar of her mother.* No one is asking you to agree with her mom. Everyone is pointing out that she is a literal child who is at once a full human with weaknesses and big feelings and a kid at the mercy of the tools her parents give her.\n\nThis may be bias on my end, but I really don\u2019t like the judgmental way you\u2019ve talked about her in this post. To me, it sounds like everyone in the family, including and maybe especially you, has already decided who and what this kid is and then made a value judgment on it. Like one of those extroverted families that demonize the one introverted kid for being other.\n\nThought exercise: imagine her in therapy in 15 years deconstructing the messages she learned from her family of origin. What is your role going to be in that?\n\nThere are so many suggestions in this thread. I hope you take one of them! Otherwise, you\u2019re just another adult in a family system punishing children both for their weaknesses and their parent\u2019s issues. What did you need as a kid? What kind of example do you want to teach your nieces?\n\nI remember being a dual flower girl for a cousin when I was very little. I was shy. I remember the dress, I remember feeling included and excited, but most of all I remember being blow away that the bride though to get ME a gift on her wedding day (a little craft kit to keep me occupied). That was a morally formative experience that has stuck with me ever since. I still strive to be the kind of person who is grounded and generous enough to consider the feelings of a small child in everyday adult living because I remember both what it was like to be on the receiving end and the happiness she seemed to derive from showing up that way in the world.\n\nIf you\u2019re so concerned with her fighting with her future cousin, address the root issue and then model a different way. Kids learn by example!", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your choice. Jess has a bad background and it\u2019s only logical to base your choices off of that.", "Eh, NAH. I can\u2019t call a 7 year old an asshole for this. Not cool that she had a tantrum and was mean to other flower girl, but it sounds like she got her feelings hurt in a big way. Just ask next time instead of assuming. I still feel some kind of way about my cousin asking our other cousin to be flower girl and not me when I was 6, and it\u2019s been 35 years, lol. Those events loom large in the mind of a little kid.", "If there's still time, I'd ask Jess to be a flower girl and see that she gets the same (or similar) dress as Ava, and all the same pre-wedding attention. However, I'd also be prepared for her to back out at the last minute and choose to attend as a regular guest in her flower girl dress--and not walk down the aisle or participate in the ceremony.

I have a niece who is 7, we'll call her Jess. And my partner has a niece who is 5, we'll call her Ava. Jess is painfully shy. She has cried through every single school function she's been in, hates having her photo taken, and takes a long time to warm up to people. So, when we picked our flower girl the obvious choice was Ava. And that seemed fine, until a few weeks ago. Now, Jess is becoming jealous. Ava was practicing the other day, and she tried to rip the basket out of her hands and we had to seperate them. She keeps complaining about how Ava gets a dress with a bow, and called her \"a stupid baby\". \n\n\n\nJess's mother is mad at me now, saying that I shouldn't have based my decision off Jess's previous actions, and that I should let her be my flower girl because she \"wants to be one so very bad\". When I said that I'm not changing my mind so close to the wedding, she said that my favortism is showing. I'm not trying to play favourites, I just thought that Jess would be miserable in that particular situation. I had no idea that this would be such a big deal.\n\n\n\n\nAITA for my choice of flower girl?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "We had 4 girls in our family that were 7, I felt that was too old to be flower girls.

She\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA!! I don't know what the other's say but to me you aren't wrong in this situation. Someone's behavior is pretty important. Being jealous and fighting shows exactly why she shouldn't be given that role on your special day and she'll be doing all the things she won't like anyway. It makes sense as to why you didn't want her to be the flower girl. Stand by your decision and I hope for the best.", "NTA\n\nThere can be a special job for Jess that doesn\u2019t put her in the direct spotlight but makes her feel included.

And she can have a pretty dress. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cater to her but she is your niece and got skipped over for the flower girl position and is upset by that.", "NTA \u2014 you had two choices Jess or Ava and Ava is the one you think will best fulfill the role as flower girl. It\u2019s not favoritism and Jess\u2019 mom can kick rocks.", "NTA. I would have done the exact same thing. It truly looks as if Jess wouldn\u2019t have been a good fit.

She's seven, she will remember this, this could be a big deal to her and become a core memory. Who cares if she's a late add in? It's just a flower girl, it's not like she needs a groomsman or anything. I hardly thing it will hurt to have a second flower girl, most people love seeing kids in a wedding party. I'm guessing an appropriate dress can be found...why not try? Unless we're in a power struggle with the kid's mom or something. I'm for showing a little grace if possible, and it certainly doesn't take away from you, the bride. Just a thought.", "NTA. She may be upset now, but if you did let her be a flower girl, guess what?

But tell Jess she can be a flower girl. Get her a dress and a basket and let her prepare. If (when) she melts down on the day, gently and quickly pull her away and let Ava shine solo as you know she will.", "NTA. Get Jess a matching dress and put her in charge of the guest book. It's  a \"much more responsible job\" since she can probably  read better than a 5 yr old.", "Soft YTA  I get that you honestly thought Jess wouldn\u2019t enjoy being a flower girl. But did you seriously think choosing only one niece wasn\u2019t going to cause problems and drama? Of course Jess is jealous! She\u2019s only 7 and things like being a flower girl are big frickin\u2019 deals to little girls. I used to teach dance lessons. I literally had to keep track in my attendance book who got to go first practicing steps \u201cacross the floor\u201d so that everyone had a chance to go first. Kids that age are obsessed with fairness. \n\nThe smart thing to do is make them both flower girls. If Jess chickens out on the big day, then so be it.  You don\u2019t worry about it and continue on with the wedding. But she\u2019ll still get to wear the dress and have the satisfaction of being a flower girl.", "Can she hold your flowers while you do vows or something?   \ncould they not walk up together?", "Nta bc you made a logical decision but I had 2 flower girls for this reason alone! (Didn't want to make anyone mad) Why not do that? Doesn't make any difference and if her mom wants to pay for the dress let her do it!", "I think considering you babysit them both for a few hours, a few days a week, then this situation was a bit inevitable. Especially if the flower girl is practising infront of her. They should have been given fair opportunities really. It would be different if they weren't so close. I know it's your wedding and appreciate your concerns, but if we were to focus on her emotions and what I think I would do next.\n\nI do get that she has shown aggressive behaviour, but I remember being a very shy child and how painful it was when I was left behind due to that. Aggressive behaviour is never okay, but I can also understand her feelings right now and she will likely remember this moment if not handled with care. I would give her the opportunity personally. \n\nIf it was me I would put a plan in place regarding safety where a parent of hers can step in and take her away from the hall on the day if she chokes. I would also apologise to her and explain that you didn't think she would enjoy it, but that of course you would love her to be a flower girl. You can also explain to her that aggression is never okay and that she can talk to you about her feelings instead. \n\nAgain completely understand that it is your wedding - I would just worry personally about such an extreme reaction. There seems to be more under the surface than her just playing up because she didn't get her way. Children really feel it if they believe another child is being favoured.", "Soft YTA, because how hard would it have been to pick both girls, let them both get pretty dresses, and if on the day of Jess didn\u2019t want to walk down the aisle, take pictures, or do anything else because she\u2019s shy\u2026then let her sit out?\n\nYou did exclude Jess, and 7 year olds aren\u2019t the best at dealing with disappointment, hence her bad behavior.  Her mother is a bit harsh to call you out on your favoritism, but she\u2019s not wrong, is she? \n\nStill, at the end of the day, if you only want the niece you prefer as your lone flower girl, that\u2019s your right!", "Jess is calling the other girl names and throwing fits. Imagine dealing with that on top of everything else on the wedding day. The mom certainly doesn't sound like she has any control over her child, so there's no reason to think it would be any different the day of.", "Even if Jess was fine before she started walking she might start blubbering halfway down the aisle. If she can't make it through a school performance without crying she can't handle walking through a crowd of people who are all staring at her and taking her picture. I mean, sucks to be her but it's OP's wedding and she's got enough on her plate without dealing with a sobbing kid getting in everyone's way.", "All you have to go off of is her prior behavior-everything you know says Jess will meltdown or otherwise ruin your day. Makes sense to pick a. Kid, if your having them involved, that has demonstrated the ability to self monitor and/or function with publicity.\n\nAt the end of the day-it\u2019s YOUR day-you get to pick everything with your partner and anyone who doesn\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t have to come-that\u2019s their choice.", "To do otherwise, is literally madness!", "For real. The whole point of an interview and them contacting your previous employer is how exactly how life works. Your actions, present and past, affect your future.", "Agreed!!! A job interviewer bases their choices off of past experiences and behaviors. \nThis can be a learning experience for Jess. Your previous actions have caused you to lose this opportunity.", "Jess's mom said that she doesn't have to apologise to Ava for being physical, because \"these are big feelings for a little girl\" and I just about lost it", "Agreed. It's not that big of a deal to have two flower girls walking together. There's no real extra expense because of it, assuming the mom's paid for the dresses for the flower girls. And if the day comes and she doesn't want to do it, or starts crying, you still have the other flower girl. IDK seems like a win, win situation to me just to have them both. No one is mad, the little girls are both happy, and having them both walk down the aisle together would be adorable.", "This is what happened at my brothers wedding. My daughter was 5, was 'head flower girl' SIL two nieces were also flower girls, a little younger, like 3/4. They both panicked at the top of the aisle, so daughter was the only one to actually walk down. But the other two got to wear pretty dresses and get their pictures with the bride also. It's a nice compromise. I never got to be a flower girl and I'm still sad about it lollll", "That would be my initial idea.  However, once OP told us about Jess' reaction and treatment toward Ava it would be a deal breaker for me.  She is old enough to know that a tantrum is not how you get what you want and that behavior should not be rewarded.", "That\u2019s what we did. We let them both wear pretty dresses and if one decided to freak out and not walk down the aisle, she didn\u2019t have do. My bday was in the spring, so I just told their mom to buy their Easter dresses and use those so she wouldn\u2019t be wasting any money if one of the girls backed out last minute", "Who has time for that on wedding day?", "But if you do this, make sure Jess knows she has to be nice to Ava from now on, and if she isn\u2019t she won\u2019t get to be a flower girl.", "That is not how life works \u2026 u don\u2019t get your way because you throw a tantrum", "This is what I was trying to articulate but didn't do it as well, except my vote was the opposite.", "Yeah, honestly sounds like Jess' mom is at home pushing the issue. NTA.", "No, because it just felt too risky. Jess is known for getting all excited about an event in the months, weeks, and even days leading up to it, and then getting cold feet at the last minute and freaking out. She also runs off when she's upset, which felt like a major safety issue. I just knew from the get go that it would not go smoothly.", "Seriously, why rub it in Jess\u2019s face that way?! ESH", "Agreed, a little kid is not going to understand the reasons OP had for not making her a flower girl. She just thinks her aunt loves her cousin more and doesn't think she's special. It was dumb of OP not to realize that a 7 year old would feel left out.", "I babysit them both. They're under the same roof for a few hours, a few days a week.", "Mom won't stop kid from hitting a younger child what makes you think she'll quietly, efficiently control her child the day of wedding.  No child is owed role in a wedding.", "Well that\u2019s exactly how this should have been managed in the beginning lol", "right? it's so baffling like children do not know how express feelings sometimes so of course they tend to act out when they don't know what to do with said feelings. it's absolutely crazy people are tearing apart this 7 year old because her aunt sucks to high heavens", "The way people are ripping this child to shreds.", "I didn't ask, I told her. But looking back, I don't think Jess really knew what a flower girl was. She seemed content with the decision, until she saw Ava wearing the dress and throwing the petals. I should have asked and I should have explained. I just assumed that she knew what it entailed, and she didn't seem bothered until recently, when I think it sunk in.", "So she can learn that throwing tantrums gets you your way? Her mom won't even make her apologize. And based on Jess being shy normally, I'm guessing her mom is putting this in her head. Op can have who she wants in her wedding. It's about her.", "I'm not sure I would go so far as to say OP is TA, but wholeheartedly agree that this should be an opportunity for empathetic problem solving rather than assigning blame. Years ago, when my goddaughter (age 5) was a flower girl, her 3-year-old brother got jealous. Their Mom asked me to bring a particular tote-bag that he liked and we made up a job for him using it. It's really not that hard to let little kids feel included. Yeah, it's not something you HAVE to do . . . but it's nice.", "And get her a pretty dress with a bow on it.", "I think my main worry is going to be keeping Jess from getting in a tussle with Ava on wedding day.  I'm just glad that my own baby is not old enough to be in it (she's still in the womb) or we would have had an even bigger battle \ud83d\ude33", "just to clarify, they're not sisters - they'll be cousins!", "I can't keep them apart, sadly. I babysit them both after school, by myself. They're going to have to tolerate each other.", "I think it's got something to do with the dress. She's surprising me. This is the same kid who starfished on the floor during the second grade Thanksgiving presentation in October and they could not convince her to get up or participate", "If Jess is usually shy, that\u2019s probably an indication of some extremely deep feelings here, as opposed to her pulling that behavior at the wedding. \n\nShy people still want to be included. She\u2019s 7. All she sees is another girl chosen over her.", "This.  I'm tempted to say OP should let her buy a dress with a bow to wear if she wants and even let her walk down the aisle with the other kid.  But the fighting is concerning, you don't want that going down the aisle.", "Jess' mom can get bent. Her precious angel is being a little shit and based on their behavior, I'd be nervous about them even attending my wedding. \nSeriously, I would assign someone to keep an eye on them and be prepared to remove them if there's any disruption.", "That's absolutely insane.  I don't understand why people have kids and yet somehow ignore that it's literally their job to teach their children to manage their feelings in a healthy way. Definitely don't have either involved in the wedding cuz they don't even remember it's not a day for them", "Jess\u2019s mom is failing as a parent for that. \u201cBig feelings\u201d isn\u2019t an excuse to not *teach your child how to process their feelings properly.* it\u2019s up to the parent to teach a child how to manage big feelings, not to brush them off without addressing them. It\u2019s a disservice to Jess to not teach her how to better accept when she\u2019s upset, it told no, or has some uncontrollable (perceived) unfairness happen to her", "Oh that's not ok, she should definitely apologize. Jess is allowed to have big feelings, but taking them out on others, she needs to learn to manage-and a heartfelt apology is part of that. Sounds like mom is being enabling and that's not helpful. I was leaning towards, if Jess apologizes, and mom finds the dress/basket/flowers, she could be a second flower girl, and you'd be guaranteed that Ava could make it down the aisle and Jess could be included where she felt comfortable. But if she's not going to apologize-and mom is not willing to help her understand *why* she should apologize-it could be a nightmare.", "Jess is not the problem. Jess\u2019s mother is the problem.", "And that\u2019s one more reason why she wasn\u2019t picked. Mom needs to help her not be a brat and to work on stage fright if she ever wants to have those opportunities.", "I think that\u2019s your answer. But you need validation from your friends or family, not us. We don\u2019t really matter.

Jess needs to apologize. Be prepared to remove them from the wedding.", "Sounds like Jess\u2019s mom is the reason for Jess\u2019s behaviour. They could be twins.", "I mean she does owe her an apology but why didn\u2019t you just offer it to both girls, knowing Jess may bow out if she got shy?\n\nShy people still don\u2019t want to be overlooked or excluded.

Like her parents.", "Seems like having both girls be flower girls would be an easy fix.  So when Jess inevitably gets cold feet, Ava can continue on.  Or, maybe if they were doing it together, Jess might have had more confidence doing it with someone else.  Or maybe think of another job Jess could do (that won't really be an issue if she flakes out).\n\nI think this is a slight YTA.  Jess obviously wants to be involved.  Giving her a small task could have probably smoothed this over.", "But mom or dad can handle her running off. Have her wear the dress etc and if she gets cold feet, mom or dad doesn\u2019t pressure her, they just take her somewhere quiet. \n\nLook, her mom is a piece of work, but consider what your actions said to Jess about her importance to you", "What plans does a flower girl really need to make? That sounds like a lot of pressure on a flower girl. \n\n\nAnd this definitely doesn't sound like \"thinking about what Jess would like,\" this is definitely is the person you think will make you look best. Which is fine, but don't pretend it was all about Jess' feelings.\n\n\nMy nephew was my flower boy. We decided that my younger nephew could join him if he wanted. He didn't, that decision was basically made at the start of the aisle, and so what?", "I also have a niece with extreme anxiety. She is coached on what to do if she has a panic moment, but when she was that age chances are good she would have bailed. She also is very self critical and missing an opportunity like this would crush her.\n\nIf it were me I wouldn't worry too much about the tantrum or whatever that's normal kid stuff. The mom is out of line, but stuff like this has a way of becoming core memories, and I would be thinking about whether I want the kid to blame me or herself later on. I would give the her a chance to walk, let her have the dress, and put no pressure whatsoever on her to actually perform - if as you and everyone else suspects she actually doesn't follow through on the aisle walk then no big deal. \n\nThat's if you want to be generous - you are under no obligation to have anyone in your wedding for any reason.", "Any chance she\u2019s autistic? I know an adult who was like that as a kid. He\u2019s high functioning, but painfully shy.", "Nobody said it would be the *parent* swiftly carting a melting down or misbehaving child away. It could be a trusted bridesmaid, the wedding planner, or some other responsible adult, true to the agreement agreed upon when the bride agreed to the second flower girl.", "Yeah people expect a 7 year old to behave perfectly but don\u2019t care that the 26 year old acted thoughtlessly.", "It\u2019s so disturbing. Calling a little girl a monster because she had one fight? What is your damage Heather?!", "Yes you should have. However I would make the  argument the question should be what SHOULD you have done but what ARE you going to do? And to be completely frank, the best time you could've had this conversation would be during the planning but the second best time is right now", "She's only 7. All she knows now in her 7 year old mind is that you like Ava more than her, and you didnt pick her because she has something wrong with her. She lashed out because she was hurt and jealous and because she's only 7. Only you can still fix this.", "I share your concern about conflict on the day between Jess and Ava. As you said, Jess is quite shy, doesn't like to have her picture taken and has cried through every school event.  The issue started with Jess seeing Ava practicing in her dress and bow. Jess seems to want the flower girl wardrobe, but she may not necessarily want the actual duty.  \n\nThere is a real possibility of Jess saying that she wants to be a flower girl, backing out on the day and then demanding that Ava not do it either.", "Oh, sorry, cousins! I'll edit. My idea still stands though :P What a cute bonding activity to do for soon-to-be cousins.", "Is there a reason Ava is \u201cpracticing\u201d flower girl stuff in front of Jess? I mentioned, that seems unnecessary and definitely throwing it in Jess\u2019 face that she wasn\u2019t chosen. How often when you baby sit do you make thinks about your wedding that only involves one child, leaving the other excluded?", "Why is the flower girl basket/ dress out while you are babysitting? That\u2019s cruel. None of this should be done in front of her. Frankly you are setting them up for these fights.", "Maybe  just get Jess   a beautiful dress , so that she feels special as well . A little auntie and me moment . However don\u2019t  feel bad about not including her in the bridal party though , I\u2019ve seen weddings where the flower girl refused to participate and yikes.", "At that age I would have hated being apart of one of my aunts or uncles wedding but I would have wanted the dress.\n\nETA: I was extremely shy too.", "That's true. But her behavior is still not a gold star in the \"yep, OP should definitely give this child a role in her wedding\" column. But I admit that perhaps I'm a bit biased. I think I personally am a hard sell when it comes to rewarding tantrums. I'll talk to the child about why they're flipping out, but I'm not one to include giving them what they were tantruming about afterwards; I'm more of a \"ok, I get that you're having a big feelings moment. Now that you're calmer, this is how you handle it next time, right?\" and that's it type of person. \n\nSo I assume Jess's mom can and will get her a pretty new dress and shoes and since that doesn't affect the wedding party in any way, I guess that will help.  Still, I'm willing to give the above poster's view some more weight when thinking through this and it makes me want to ask if this would work as a possible compromise: \n\nOP, have you considered having Jess sit up front and do the very important job of taking your bouquet while you say your vows? Normally, I think your friend of honor would, if there is one, but unless you are very tied to who holds on to it during the ceremony, this could present a good compromise. You're up front and everyone is in place and paying attention, so it's a significant moment, but it's short. You turn to her, she walks up to you, she gets to hold the very important bouquet and walk back to her seat with it in front of everyone...and then give it to her mom or your sibling or some other adult that will make sure she doesn't nervously pull it apart or lose it. And then they can either help her give it back to you after the officiant pronounces you partner and partner or your SIL/sibling can turn it over to the FOH or even hold onto it until the reception and give it back to you then. You can even make a second big deal about it if you're going to throw the bouquet by having whoever makes the announcement calling people up to catch it also include a 'drum roll' type moment during which the \"official keeper of the bridal bouquet, Jess\" brings it up to you for this very important moment.", "Jess is **7** and Ava is **5**. If my 7yo threw a tantrum because a **younger** child who was better behaved, more outgoing, or whatever, got to enjoy a privilege instead of my child, I would be upset with my child and give them a lecture. Jess's mother should've been at least embarrassed by her daughter's jealous outbursts.", "Chill, she is 7.", "You and Ladyughsalot are the few voices of reason and understanding in this thread. Thanks!!", "It's not a matter of maturity, its a matter of rewarding bad behavior.\n\nIf she has a tantrum, and you give her what she wants, the lesson is Tantrum = Reward", "> You\u2019re expecting a lot of maturity from a\n\n**SEVEN year old - who should know that it is not acceptable behaviour to assault and bully other children**, c'mon.  Trying to rip the basket out of her hands, and they \u2018had to be separated\u2019 - that\u2019s assault.  This 7yr old self-entitled monster isn\u2019t a 3 yr old.", "She\u2019s extremely shy. If she had an outburst like this it\u2019s a one-off brought on by deep feelings of being lesser-than", "Yep.", "Then don't have ANY flower girl.\nBecause that can be overwhelming for any small person, and having room for their ebbs and flows is required if you are going to include them at all.\n\nOP has absolutely no way to predict what 5 will do come the day.\n\nMy absolutely outgoing, social, performative 5yo, who frequently spoke up in public crowds and sang with her friends in a little choir, surrounded by a wedding party of aunties and uncles she knew well,  panicked and had to be carried down the aisle at my best friends wedding.\n\nThen stripped and gave dad the slip, to be chased starkers across the dance floor.\n\nShe lived the hell out of that dress, tho.\n\n7 is little.\n5 is even littler.\n\nInviting one was a setup for emotions no kid that age has the facility and maturity to articulate and manage, without a whole lot of help that this one didn't get.\n\nThis was PREDICTABLE.", "It\u2019s not the sister or nieces wedding - I wouldn\u2019t want a flower girl throwing a tantrum right before we\u2019re going to walk down the aisle or potentially as they are about to start and in front of guests. This is OPs wedding. Agree that a sidebar conversation with mom could have smoothed the waters first but just to say listen- because of the reactions to past events we are going to ask other niece to be flower girl, maybe have Ava partake in girl trips and even get the same dress. But to avoid any stress or concerns about a meltdown before everyone (bride included) walk down the aisle it is totally reasonable for bride to say she\u2019s not a flower girl. If Ava\u2019s mom is the sister she\u2019s also likely in the wedding and would be distracted if her child had a meltdown. OP is getting married once- everyone is there to support her, sister included.

This wasn\u2019t handled the way it should have been for a child.", "Jess doesn\u2019t sound like much of a sweetie pie but soft YTA because they\u2019re little kids and all you had to do was offer. Let the KID decide to accept, reject, or accept and panic at the last second. What would be the big deal, especially if there\u2019s an extra flower girl? \n\nOnce the kid is getting violent, well, that\u2019s a diff situation.

Oh, and some dude reciting a poem he wrote for the occasion, where he rhymed \u201cshe was a looker\u201d and \u201cdressed like a hooker\u201d in reference to my (very religious) aunt.", "Yeah- but that\u2019s not Jess\u2019s fault", "More like \u201cgoing forward, if you feel left out or overlooked you need to express that with words.
