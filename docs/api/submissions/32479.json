I have a niece who is 7, we'll call her Jess. And my partner has a niece who is 5, we'll call her Ava. Jess is painfully shy. She has cried through every single school function she's been in, hates having her photo taken, and takes a long time to warm up to people. So, when we picked our flower girl the obvious choice was Ava. And that seemed fine, until a few weeks ago. Now, Jess is becoming jealous. Ava was practicing the other day, and she tried to rip the basket out of her hands and we had to seperate them. She keeps complaining about how Ava gets a dress with a bow, and called her \"a stupid baby\". \n\n\n\nJess's mother is mad at me now, saying that I shouldn't have based my decision off Jess's previous actions, and that I should let her be my flower girl because she \"wants to be one so very bad\". When I said that I'm not changing my mind so close to the wedding, she said that my favortism is showing. I'm not trying to play favourites, I just thought that Jess would be miserable in that particular situation. I had no idea that this would be such a big deal.\n\n\n\n\nAITA for my choice of flower girl?", "created_utc": 1701887574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18canm5/aita_for_only_picking_one_of_my_nieces_to_be_my/", "score": 1399, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d tell her she can also be a flower girl if she wants to, she can have a pretty dress with a bow, and she can walk down the aisle with Ava.

She might very well panic when it's a room full of people and not just the few there rehearsing. \n\nCan you give her another job that lets her wear a fancy dress?  Perhaps she could man the table where the guest book is.  She could have her mother/another relative with her as support, and you can convince a 7 year old that it is beyond important that everyone sign there name.  Practice how to ask someone to sign the book.  She may not be able to do anything but hide behind her mom, but she will have had a job and that will mean the world to her.\n\nI was a painfully shy child.

You made this decision partially to protect Jess from her own embarrassment/crying in public.  It's not your fault she can't handle being in public functions.\n\nBTW, you could have had both of them be flower girls.  I've been to multiple weddings where they have more than one. But it's your wedding so if that wouldn't have fit your aesthetic, then that by itself makes you not the AH.", "NTA.  You selected a flower girl based on who you thought could best do it.   This wasn\u2019t selecting who you love more!  Jess reacting the way she did, is on her parents not you.

Have the parents get the dress etc. \n\nYou thought you were considerate, but she\u2019s 7. All she sees is another girl chosen over her. \n\nSo she acted out.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you offer something like she wears a dress and holds your bouquet til it\u2019s time to go, or she could help grandma to her seat and wear the dress etc?

And they can buy the dress and the shoes and if the little girl has a panic attack at showtime, as her history has shown her to be very likely to do\u2026well, the crying little girl will be promptly escorted to a quiet room with a solid door away from the ceremony where she will disturb *no one*. \n\nAnd make it clear that your wedding will not be delayed by one minute if Jess is hesitant at a crucial moment. If Jess wants to be a flower so very very much, you will let her,  *if*, and only if she plays her role as required. \n\nNTA and drama like this is why some people just elope.

Jess\u2019s mother should\u2019ve been mature enough to understand and the excuse \u201cbased on past actions\u201d makes no sense. You can\u2019t pick based on future actions! And how many flower girls do you need? This is YOUR wedding and you can do what you want. You and fianc\u00e9 should go adopt a raggedy shelter dog and make them the flower girl.", " I\u2019d simply explain that flower girls tend to be younger in age like 5. Maybe that will settle them down.", "NTA. Her attitude may make preparation difficult anyway. But kids just want to feel important. Call her the \u201cFlower Protector\u201d, give her a wand from the dollar store or something. Tell her job is to safely deliver the flowers from the store/flower shop to the basket her cousin is carrying down the aisle. Be dramatic; you guys didn\u2019t even know you needed a Flower Protector but the deliverers cancelled suddenly and someone has to let the birds know they\u2019re flowers for the wedding (by waving the wand) and not to pick up the pretty flowers to carry to their nests. She\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s still learning to process her emotions, so the behavior is probably not mean spirited deep down. Letting her cousin shine, while also being given an \u201cimportant job\u201d is a happy compromise I think.", "NTA.  It's your wedding and you get to choose who is involved.  Also, what kind of message are you sending Jess if you reward her behavior toward Ava.  (Physically stealing things and name-calling is NOT how you get what you want!)", "YTA. You\u2019re putting a lot of blame on a 7 year old, mention you didn\u2019t ask her but told her she wasn\u2019t going to be a flower girl and \u201cthat she seemed the accept it\u201d but didn\u2019t understand what it meant. Of course not she\u2019s 7 - do you think she\u2019s been to a lot of weddings to draw experience from? \n\nAlso she\u2019s your niece - do you even like her? You could have gotten them the same dress but only have Ava do the walk down the aisle if Jess has a history of being shy. You don\u2019t have to do anything but you could have been much more thoughtful of an aunt.\n\nAlso, you say \u201cthe obvious choice was Ava\u201d like there\u2019s only the possibility of one flower girl. There\u2019s no rules, you can have no flower girls or a dozen. Picking one and excluding the other is an asshole move.", "YTA. She is 7 years old. She is a small child. This is extremely normal behavior (not to mention  predictable--honestly, you should have seen this coming).\n\nLet her have a pretty dress and a little basket of flower petals or whatever. If she gets cold feet and can't do the flower girl thing when the time comes, no one needs to force it because the other kid will have it covered. But this way, she gets to be included and have a good social learning opportunity. \n\nYou could be kind and generous, but you're taking a hard line stance with a little child. YTA", "ESH   Why is the 7 year old at a practice ??", "NTA\n\nThis is natural consequences", "Info: I'm kinda confused but when and how did the conversation actually go when you communicated with Jess and asked her if you wanted to be a flower girl? I'm assuming you weren't so dismissive and disrespectful to your niece that you completely disregarded her opinion and thoughts to make a decision regarding her place in your life without her input. Having her response during that conversation, will help a lot with trying to figure out what's going on.\nI've spent the vast majority of my life around kids and one thing I can tell you is kids aren't half as stupid as adults like to believe they are and even though they might not be able to express it, they think and analyze just as much as adults.", "NTA \n\nYou do have a problem on your hands though as you don't want Jess and her Mom's feelings hurt for a long time.  I come from a large family and can not have everyone in the bridal party so we have come up with duties that make the other kids special. \n\nOne idea is that she can dress really pretty and hand out the programs before the ceremony this places her up front and special.\n\nOr she can stand at a table (with or without someone else) at the reception with the Guest Book and welcome people and ask them to sign the guest book.  At one family wedding we had 3 little girls share that duty and they loved it. \n\nAt stake here is the child not feeling as important and when we love them we don't want to hurt them.", "Ok a seven year old is old enough to talk to about this. Nta but it would be good if you tried.  \n\nTell her the truth:  that you thought she wouldn\u2019t like it because she is very shy. \n\nThen listen- is it just the dress she wants? Is the fact that Ava is so much younger ( 2 years is a long time when you are seven!)\n\nSee what she is upset about.  I know this seems silly with all the wedding prep-  but can you take an hour to sort this out?", "YTA.\n\nNot the biggest one, but since children are involved, you should have done better. Asked Jess, used them both, etc.\n\nBut really this situation begs for problem solving, not judgment. Wedding miscalculations like this tend to spiral out of control and overshadow the day, so stop worrying about if you were justified and start figuring out how to solve this. If you don't want to add another flower girl, find a special post for Jess suited to her strengths. Make her your bouquet holding and-tossing assistant or cake assistant, have her escort an elderly relative down the aisle so she feels like she is part of the ceremony, have her walk your dog down the aisle, or whatever.", "NTA Its your wedding you do what you want and everyone needs to understand that! You aren't obligated to have anyone in your wedding", "NTA and u were correct in making your choice based off her previous behavior", "No, you're NTA. You get to pick who's in the wedding party, based on how you want the ceremony to go. You have no obligation to pick certain people.", "NTA but you should have see that coming, they are little children, is really obvious that Jess would  be jealous of her cousin. \n\nMy sugesti\u00f3n here is, if you want, give her a small role in your wedding, that way she could wear a pretty dress and feel important too.", "In the comments, you said Jess's mom said Jess doesn't have to apologize to Ava.\n\nI think the tantrum and her mother's response to it are the clinchers that show you made the correct decision.\n\nNTA.", "NAH.  Jess is 7.  She may be shy but maybe she wants to try.  Does it invalidate your wedding if Jess wants the title but doesn't follow through and walk down the aisle.  I had my 2 nieces as flower girls, one walked the other had her mom carry her down the aisle.   Her mom, one of my attendants, held her the entire time.  I have some cute pictures of it.  My mom had 3 flower girls all under the age of 5.  One had just turned 2.  My mom still laughs about it. It was like herding cats.  Tell your sister to buy her the dress that way it won't cost you anything.  Let her participate as much as she wants.  If she ends up sitting somewhere else during the whole ceremony- big deal. You have a flower girl up for the task.  It is a small kindness in a world that isn't kind.", "YTA. Make both girls flower girls, buy them matching dresses and do their hair and makeup the same. Make them as close to identical as you can. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to unless you can't go to a shoppe and find 2 matching dresses. Which you can.", "Ehh... NTA, but.... You can do what you want with your wedding, so you're not the asshole, but this was so entirely predictable that I'm surprised their mother agreed in the first place. of course Jess is jealous and is acting like an angry seven year old. Children are, you know, childish. You skipped over the older child and went to the younger when you could just as easily have had both be flower girls. If Jess had found it too much, you would still have had a flower girl. I can't help but think that their mother is right and there's some favoritism here. That being said, she agreed to this plan that had 'this is going to work out poorly' written all over it, so she really can't say much. You're both at fault for not thinking about how this would look to the kids and make Jess feel in a realistic way. Make both of them flower girls and avoid damaging the relationship between sisters, which is far more important than sticking with your plan.", "Wrong question. For that easy N T A, it's your wedding.\n\nBut honestly, do you not think you could maybe see the side of a disappointed 7 year old?\n\nShe's seven, of course she's hurt, and she will remember this forever. Did you put any effort into thinking of another way of including her in the wedding?", "YTA and so is everyone else who has these stupid flower girl arguments. You should've asked them both", "YTA but not a total. Both girls should have been asked.", "YTA", "NTA it's your choice and I understand why you made it.  That said, could you create another non-public role for Jess?  Could she be your special helper on the wedding day or something like that?  Arrange a special photo of just you and her?  Then she won't feel left out, but also won't cry through the whole ceremony.", "Have 2 flower girls", "Just make both of them a flower girl? Is it that deep?", "Yta. You are judging a five year old.", "NAH.  I get it.  The wedding is around the corner and you're stressing and now you got people complaining about a flower girl.  Any chance you can just get her a comparable dress, bows, etc. and send her down the aisle with Ava?   Just have both of them do it.  If Jess bails out at the last minute, no harm, no foul.", "YTA .   Did you ask her?  Maybe let them both be flower girls? It doesnt have to be one.  She probably would of felt a little more comfortable knowing she wouldnt be alone. They are just walking their little selves down the aisle throwing flowers for a few minutes its nothing too serious to exclude 1 child. It wouldnt ruin your wedding.", "NTA. Your wedding your choice! But\u2026 I feel like you could have predicted there would be tension here over this decision. Is there a background job you could give Jess? Tell her it\u2019s her job to make sure all the bridesmaids have their flowers. Give her a little clipboard or something idk.", "NTA. \n\nJess is only acting this way because she is jealous. Guaranteed if you changed your mind, she would freeze up and cry the day of and potentially ruin the ceremony. \n7 years olds do not understand pressure or expectations until they are physically in that moment. She simply wants this now because another child has it, not because she's now suddenly capable and no longer shy. \n\nAgain, NTA. It's your wedding day, it's your choice. You chose to have 1 flower girl, not 2, and it would hurt Ava dearly if you changed your mind. \nJess' Mom is only upset because her daughter is upset. That is not your responsibility. \n\nGo have a good wedding, OP!", "> I shouldn't have based my decision off Jess's previous actions,\n\nNo, you should base it on her current actions. She is jealous, aggressive and complaining. \n\nNTA", "There are many things i \"want to be so very badly\". Because i was raised with home training, I understand i do t get everything i want just because i want it, and that its not appropriate to be a little stinker to others bc im jealous.\n\nThey didnt suddenly teach me that when i turned 24, they started when i was little. Jess' mom needs to focus more on the fact her daughters assaulting a 5 year old, calling her names, and behaving badly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would also not choose the painfully shy, crying child to walk down an aisle solo with everybody in a church staring at her. My guess is that Jess doesn't quite understand the social horror of being a flower girl -- just understands that it's pretty and important and that she wants what her cousin has. Put in that situation, expected to perform in that way, would be terrifying for a small child.\n\nThat all said, you do have to know that no matter how kind and valid your intentions, it *does* look like favoritism to Jess and that she'll remember her cousin being chosen over her. I'm really not fussed about what the mom thinks and you don't have to consider her feelings on the matter in this -- only Jess' and Ava's count.\n\nIf you wanted to really do something cute, you can have Ava be the flower girl and then have Jess be the Flower Girl's Assistant. If the day comes, Jess is dressed prettily, and she feels confident enough to walk down the aisle with her cousin, then that will be an absolutely adorable photo op for both of them *and* a memorable experience for both cousins. If she backs out at the last minute, no problem, because Jess was the intended flower girl all along and will be prepared to walk the aisle alone. Everybody wins.", "YTA\n\nYour wedding, your choice - but it doesn't change the fact that you hurt Jess' feelings and don't seem to care or have any desire to try and make it up to her.", "NTA \n\nWhen applying for a job your resume is reviewed to see if you\u2019re a fit for the job. \n\nUnfortunately, Jess\u2019 resume is not a good fit for this role. The job of flower girl would put her in a situation she has proven she struggles with. A wedding is not the place or time to allow her to gain additional experience. \n\nIf Jess is truly only upset that the flower girl gets a dress with a bow then all her dreams can still come true! Maybe she can wear a dress with a bow of her choosing to your wedding.", "YTA. Let her be a flower girl fer crissake. If she's too shy in the moment, then she can choose to hang back, no harm, no foul. If she panics, pees herself, and has a meltdown in the middle of the ceremony, boo hoo, who cares. And you'll be able to grab the mic at the reception and say I told you so.", "NTA. I can see why she might be upset, but it\u2019s not worth the risk of her crying through your ceremony and photos.", "NTA, but I would just try to keep the peace and let them both be flower girls, my uncle got married and they chose my aunt\u2019s niece from her side to be the flower girl and I was the \u201cbell girl\u201d (like wtf is that) it hurt my feelings so bad when I was like 6. Did I get over it eventually? Of course, so yes everyone will forget about it and it won\u2019t matter who walked down the aisle once y\u2019all are married anyway.\n\nI agree with others that her behavior was unacceptable, but if she wants to be a flower girl so bad and your sister (or SIL) doesn\u2019t think her past actions will effect her walking down the aisle then tell her to buy a matching dress to Ava\u2019s and they can both walk down the aisle, then day of Jess will probably get cold feet and chicken out anyway. If she doesn\u2019t then maybe this experience can give her confidence to be in front of people more.", "YTA I really think it would be very little hassle to include her. If she gets cold feet on the day, so what! It's not going to ruin your entire day, everyone knows kids will be kids FFS. Family before perfection.", "Tell Jess\u2019s mother that she was not chosen because she is not well-behaved enough to be a flower-girl, and her recent tantrums prove it, and say you will understand if the mother decides not to attend and not hold it against them.", "She's literally showing why she wasn't picked to be flower girl. If you didn't like her and were doing it off of that, I would say Y T A. \n\nBut you're genuinely doing it based off of past experience with her, and she won't behave. nta", "NTA it\u2019s your choice who you have in your wedding party. It\u2019s your wedding - not Jess\u2019 or her mum\u2019s wedding. Your choice was Ava who doesn\u2019t react to being in the spotlight in a negative way. People need to wake up and realise that not every child has to be chosen for an event, get a participation award or be rewarded for acting like a brat. Big feelings from a little girl doesn\u2019t mean physicality is ok.", "NTA.  Your wedding so you can choose whoever you want.  You chose based on displayed behaviour which is perfectly fine.", "NTA. Sometimes life stinks and that\u2019s the way it goes. I honestly would\u2019ve just had them both as flower girls if the one didn\u2019t want to do it because of being shy then be like ok and wouldn\u2019t hear a thing. I think the fact they are rude when this is a happy time is very unfair to you 2. I\u2019m sorry people stinks.", "NTA. You seem to have a better handle on Jess's social abilities than her mom does. Maybe you can let her do something that could be dropped without any major consequences to the ceremony. Maybe take your bouquet from the MOH? Walk in with your mom? Jess can have a pretty dress and a bow. No laws against that. Tell her  mom to start shopping.  Keep these 2 girls apart until after the wedding ceremony.", "NTA but you could still give her a job to make her feel special and included. No one likes to feel left out- let her keep the guest book or help serve cake. Buy her a special outfit just for the wedding", "NTA for thinking she wouldn\u2019t want to be a flower girl - however I\u2019m guessing Jess wasn\u2019t actually asked if she wanted to be a flower girl or  included somehow? She\u2019s 7 she\u2019s gonna remember being excluded but unless you told her why she\u2019s not going to understand why you didn\u2019t ask her. -\n\nSome ideas-\n\nWould it be possible to include her in some way? Even if it\u2019s just helping you get ready?  is it possible have them both be flower girls? Maybe get her a matching dress to Ava or a similar dress that has a bow? \nJess seems jealous of the dress at minimum to as much as that she was excluded and being shy doesn\u2019t mean she would not want to be included with the wedding. It\u2019s still a month off at least depending which part of the month it\u2019s in. Ask her if she wants to be a part it in some way or if she just wants a dress with a bow\u2026", "Hm. Soft YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t punish your niece for her moms parenting limitations, help her! You could have avoided this entirely, I think. But since you didn\u2019t (everyone makes mistakes), in one swift move you could teach her accountability, validate her feelings and worth, show her a different way of communicating her feelings, and come up with a creative solution that met her need to not feel overlooked and ashamed while simultaneously communicating your care for her as a little human being, *not a potential prop or complication for your big day or an avatar of her mother.* No one is asking you to agree with her mom. Everyone is pointing out that she is a literal child who is at once a full human with weaknesses and big feelings and a kid at the mercy of the tools her parents give her.\n\nThis may be bias on my end, but I really don\u2019t like the judgmental way you\u2019ve talked about her in this post. To me, it sounds like everyone in the family, including and maybe especially you, has already decided who and what this kid is and then made a value judgment on it. Like one of those extroverted families that demonize the one introverted kid for being other.\n\nThought exercise: imagine her in therapy in 15 years deconstructing the messages she learned from her family of origin. What is your role going to be in that?\n\nThere are so many suggestions in this thread. I hope you take one of them! Otherwise, you\u2019re just another adult in a family system punishing children both for their weaknesses and their parent\u2019s issues. What did you need as a kid? What kind of example do you want to teach your nieces?\n\nI remember being a dual flower girl for a cousin when I was very little. I was shy. I remember the dress, I remember feeling included and excited, but most of all I remember being blow away that the bride though to get ME a gift on her wedding day (a little craft kit to keep me occupied). That was a morally formative experience that has stuck with me ever since. I still strive to be the kind of person who is grounded and generous enough to consider the feelings of a small child in everyday adult living because I remember both what it was like to be on the receiving end and the happiness she seemed to derive from showing up that way in the world.\n\nIf you\u2019re so concerned with her fighting with her future cousin, address the root issue and then model a different way. Kids learn by example!", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding and your choice. Jess has a bad background and it\u2019s only logical to base your choices off of that.", "Eh, NAH. I can\u2019t call a 7 year old an asshole for this. Not cool that she had a tantrum and was mean to other flower girl, but it sounds like she got her feelings hurt in a big way. Just ask next time instead of assuming. I still feel some kind of way about my cousin asking our other cousin to be flower girl and not me when I was 6, and it\u2019s been 35 years, lol. Those events loom large in the mind of a little kid.", "If there's still time, I'd ask Jess to be a flower girl and see that she gets the same (or similar) dress as Ava, and all the same pre-wedding attention. However, I'd also be prepared for her to back out at the last minute and choose to attend as a regular guest in her flower girl dress--and not walk down the aisle or participate in the ceremony.

I have a niece who is 7, we'll call her Jess. And my partner has a niece who is 5, we'll call her Ava. Jess is painfully shy. She has cried through every single school function she's been in, hates having her photo taken, and takes a long time to warm up to people. So, when we picked our flower girl the obvious choice was Ava. And that seemed fine, until a few weeks ago. Now, Jess is becoming jealous. Ava was practicing the other day, and she tried to rip the basket out of her hands and we had to seperate them. She keeps complaining about how Ava gets a dress with a bow, and called her \"a stupid baby\". \n\n\n\nJess's mother is mad at me now, saying that I shouldn't have based my decision off Jess's previous actions, and that I should let her be my flower girl because she \"wants to be one so very bad\". When I said that I'm not changing my mind so close to the wedding, she said that my favortism is showing. I'm not trying to play favourites, I just thought that Jess would be miserable in that particular situation. I had no idea that this would be such a big deal.\n\n\n\n\nAITA for my choice of flower girl?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "We had 4 girls in our family that were 7, I felt that was too old to be flower girls.

She\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA!! I don't know what the other's say but to me you aren't wrong in this situation. Someone's behavior is pretty important. Being jealous and fighting shows exactly why she shouldn't be given that role on your special day and she'll be doing all the things she won't like anyway.

Stand by your decision and I hope for the best.", "NTA\n\nThere can be a special job for Jess that doesn\u2019t put her in the direct spotlight but makes her feel included.

And she can have a pretty dress. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cater to her but she is your niece and got skipped over for the flower girl position and is upset by that.", "NTA \u2014 you had two choices Jess or Ava and Ava is the one you think will best fulfill the role as flower girl. It\u2019s not favoritism and Jess\u2019 mom can kick rocks.", "NTA. I would have done the exact same thing. It truly looks as if Jess wouldn\u2019t have been a good fit.

She's seven, she will remember this, this could be a big deal to her and become a core memory. Who cares if she's a late add in? It's just a flower girl, it's not like she needs a groomsman or anything. I hardly thing it will hurt to have a second flower girl, most people love seeing kids in a wedding party. I'm guessing an appropriate dress can be found...why not try? Unless we're in a power struggle with the kid's mom or something. I'm for showing a little grace if possible, and it certainly doesn't take away from you, the bride. Just a thought.", "NTA. She may be upset now, but if you did let her be a flower girl, guess what?

But tell Jess she can be a flower girl. Get her a dress and a basket and let her prepare. If (when) she melts down on the day, gently and quickly pull her away and let Ava shine solo as you know she will.", "NTA. Get Jess a matching dress and put her in charge of the guest book. It's  a \"much more responsible job\" since she can probably  read better than a 5 yr old.", "Soft YTA  I get that you honestly thought Jess wouldn\u2019t enjoy being a flower girl. But did you seriously think choosing only one niece wasn\u2019t going to cause problems and drama? Of course Jess is jealous! She\u2019s only 7 and things like being a flower girl are big frickin\u2019 deals to little girls. I used to teach dance lessons. I literally had to keep track in my attendance book who got to go first practicing steps \u201cacross the floor\u201d so that everyone had a chance to go first. Kids that age are obsessed with fairness. \n\nThe smart thing to do is make them both flower girls. If Jess chickens out on the big day, then so be it.

But she\u2019ll still get to wear the dress and have the satisfaction of being a flower girl.", "Can she hold your flowers while you do vows or something?   \ncould they not walk up together?", "Nta bc you made a logical decision but I had 2 flower girls for this reason alone! (Didn't want to make anyone mad) Why not do that? Doesn't make any difference and if her mom wants to pay for the dress let her do it!", "I think considering you babysit them both for a few hours, a few days a week, then this situation was a bit inevitable. Especially if the flower girl is practising infront of her. They should have been given fair opportunities really. It would be different if they weren't so close. I know it's your wedding and appreciate your concerns, but if we were to focus on her emotions and what I think I would do next.\n\nI do get that she has shown aggressive behaviour, but I remember being a very shy child and how painful it was when I was left behind due to that. Aggressive behaviour is never okay, but I can also understand her feelings right now and she will likely remember this moment if not handled with care. I would give her the opportunity personally. \n\nIf it was me I would put a plan in place regarding safety where a parent of hers can step in and take her away from the hall on the day if she chokes. I would also apologise to her and explain that you didn't think she would enjoy it, but that of course you would love her to be a flower girl. You can also explain to her that aggression is never okay and that she can talk to you about her feelings instead. \n\nAgain completely understand that it is your wedding - I would just worry personally about such an extreme reaction. There seems to be more under the surface than her just playing up because she didn't get her way.

Imagine dealing with that on top of everything else on the wedding day. The mom certainly doesn't sound like she has any control over her child, so there's no reason to think it would be any different the day of.", "Even if Jess was fine before she started walking she might start blubbering halfway down the aisle. If she can't make it through a school performance without crying she can't handle walking through a crowd of people who are all staring at her and taking her picture. I mean, sucks to be her but it's OP's wedding and she's got enough on her plate without dealing with a sobbing kid getting in everyone's way.", "All you have to go off of is her prior behavior-everything you know says Jess will meltdown or otherwise ruin your day. Makes sense to pick a. Kid, if your having them involved, that has demonstrated the ability to self monitor and/or function with publicity.\n\nAt the end of the day-it\u2019s YOUR day-you get to pick everything with your partner and anyone who doesn\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t have to come-that\u2019s their choice.", "To do otherwise, is literally madness!", "For real. The whole point of an interview and them contacting your previous employer is how exactly how life works. Your actions, present and past, affect your future.", "Agreed!!! A job interviewer bases their choices off of past experiences and behaviors. \nThis can be a learning experience for Jess. Your previous actions have caused you to lose this opportunity.", "Jess's mom said that she doesn't have to apologise to Ava for being physical, because \"these are big feelings for a little girl\" and I just about lost it", "Agreed. It's not that big of a deal to have two flower girls walking together. There's no real extra expense because of it, assuming the mom's paid for the dresses for the flower girls. And if the day comes and she doesn't want to do it, or starts crying, you still have the other flower girl. IDK seems like a win, win situation to me just to have them both. No one is mad, the little girls are both happy, and having them both walk down the aisle together would be adorable.", "This is what happened at my brothers wedding. My daughter was 5, was 'head flower girl' SIL two nieces were also flower girls, a little younger, like 3/4. They both panicked at the top of the aisle, so daughter was the only one to actually walk down. But the other two got to wear pretty dresses and get their pictures with the bride also. It's a nice compromise. I never got to be a flower girl and I'm still sad about it lollll", "That would be my initial idea.  However, once OP told us about Jess' reaction and treatment toward Ava it would be a deal breaker for me.  She is old enough to know that a tantrum is not how you get what you want and that behavior should not be rewarded.", "That\u2019s what we did. We let them both wear pretty dresses and if one decided to freak out and not walk down the aisle, she didn\u2019t have do. My wedding was in the spring, so I just told their mom to buy their Easter dresses and use those so she wouldn\u2019t be wasting any money if one of the girls backed out last minute", "Who has time for that on wedding day?", "But if you do this, make sure Jess knows she has to be nice to Ava from now on, and if she isn\u2019t she won\u2019t get to be a flower girl.", "That is not how life works \u2026 u don\u2019t get your way because you throw a tantrum", "This is what I was trying to articulate but didn't do it as well, except my vote was the opposite.", "Yeah, honestly sounds like Jess' mom is at home pushing the issue. NTA.", "No, because it just felt too risky. Jess is known for getting all excited about an event in the months, weeks, and even days leading up to it, and then getting cold feet at the last minute and freaking out. She also runs off when she's upset, which felt like a major safety issue. I just knew from the get go that it would not go smoothly.", "Seriously, why rub it in Jess\u2019s face that way?! ESH", "Agreed, a little kid is not going to understand the reasons OP had for not making her a flower girl. She just thinks her aunt loves her cousin more and doesn't think she's special. It was dumb of OP not to realize that a 7 year old would feel left out.", "I babysit them both. They're under the same roof for a few hours, a few days a week.", "Mom won't stop kid from hitting a younger child what makes you think she'll quietly, efficiently control her child the day of wedding.  No child is owed role in a wedding.", "Well that\u2019s exactly how this should have been managed in the beginning lol", "right? it's so baffling like children do not know how express feelings sometimes so of course they tend to act out when they don't know what to do with said feelings. it's absolutely crazy people are tearing apart this 7 year old because her aunt sucks to high heavens", "The way people are ripping this child to shreds.", "I didn't ask, I told her. But looking back, I don't think Jess really knew what a flower girl was. She seemed content with the decision, until she saw Ava wearing the dress and throwing the petals. I should have asked and I should have explained. I just assumed that she knew what it entailed, and she didn't seem bothered until recently, when I think it sunk in.", "So she can learn that throwing tantrums gets you your way? Her mom won't even make her apologize. And based on Jess being shy normally, I'm guessing her mom is putting this in her head. Op can have who she wants in her wedding. It's about her.", "I'm not sure I would go so far as to say OP is TA, but wholeheartedly agree that this should be an opportunity for empathetic problem solving rather than assigning blame. Years ago, when my goddaughter (age 5) was a flower girl, her 3-year-old brother got jealous. Their Mom asked me to bring a particular tote-bag that he liked and we made up a job for him using it. It's really not that hard to let little kids feel included. Yeah, it's not something you HAVE to do . . . but it's nice.", "And get her a pretty dress with a bow on it.", "I think my main worry is going to be keeping Jess from getting in a tussle with Ava on wedding day.

I babysit them both after school, by myself. They're going to have to tolerate each other.", "I think it's got something to do with the dress. She's surprising me. This is the same kid who starfished on the floor during the second grade Thanksgiving presentation in October and they could not convince her to get up or participate", "If Jess is usually shy, that\u2019s probably an indication of some extremely deep feelings here, as opposed to her pulling that behavior at the wedding. \n\nShy people still want to be included. She\u2019s 7. All she sees is another girl chosen over her.", "This.  I'm tempted to say OP should let her buy a dress with a bow to wear if she wants and even let her walk down the aisle with the other kid.  But the fighting is concerning, you don't want that going down the aisle.", "Jess' mom can get bent. Her precious angel is being a little shit and based on their behavior, I'd be nervous about them even attending my wedding. \nSeriously, I would assign someone to keep an eye on them and be prepared to remove them if there's any disruption.", "That's absolutely insane.  I don't understand why people have kids and yet somehow ignore that it's literally their job to teach their children to manage their feelings in a healthy way. Definitely don't have either involved in the wedding cuz they don't even remember it's not a day for them", "Jess\u2019s mom is failing as a parent for that. \u201cBig feelings\u201d isn\u2019t an excuse to not *teach your child how to process their feelings properly.* it\u2019s up to the parent to teach a child how to manage big feelings, not to brush them off without addressing them. It\u2019s a disservice to Jess to not teach her how to better accept when she\u2019s upset, it told no, or has some uncontrollable (perceived) unfairness happen to her", "Oh that's not ok, she should definitely apologize. Jess is allowed to have big feelings, but taking them out on others, she needs to learn to manage-and a heartfelt apology is part of that. Sounds like mom is being enabling and that's not helpful. I was leaning towards, if Jess apologizes, and mom finds the dress/basket/flowers, she could be a second flower girl, and you'd be guaranteed that Ava could make it down the aisle and Jess could be included where she felt comfortable.

Jess\u2019s mother is the problem.", "And that\u2019s one more reason why she wasn\u2019t picked.

Normally, I think your friend of honor would, if there is one, but unless you are very tied to who holds on to it during the ceremony, this could present a good compromise. You're up front and everyone is in place and paying attention, so it's a significant moment, but it's short. You turn to her, she walks up to you, she gets to hold the very important bouquet and walk back to her seat with it in front of everyone...and then give it to her mom or your sibling or some other adult that will make sure she doesn't nervously pull it apart or lose it. And then they can either help her give it back to you after the officiant pronounces you partner and partner or your SIL/sibling can turn it over to the FOH or even hold onto it until the reception and give it back to you then. You can even make a second big deal about it if you're going to throw the bouquet by having whoever makes the announcement calling people up to catch it also include a 'drum roll' type moment during which the \"official keeper of the bridal bouquet, Jess\" brings it up to you for this very important moment.", "Jess is **7** and Ava is **5**.

I think asking Ava in front of Jess and doing flower girl activities directly in front of her and expecting her to not be upset is pretty unreasonable. She\u2019s 7, something like this could feel like a personal attack, even though it wasn\u2019t meant as one. I think her outburst obviously demands some type of reprimand but it is sort of unfair to expect her to be completely fine when she\u2019s being fully excluded. I think this could\u2019ve been handled by having both girls be flower girls, if Jess freaks out, grandma or mom or someone can tuck her off to the side and Ava can continue, and Jess still gets to wear a pretty dress and have special pictures with the bride. At the end of the day that\u2019s really probably all she wants.", "YTA.  What harm would it have done.  Try to empathize being that age.", "Yeah YTA and an idiot.  The comment sections is nuts.", "YTA. She\u2019s 7. Keep that in mind. You assumed that a 7 year old would know what a flower girl was. She\u2019s 7, she didn\u2019t know. Your niece is feeling hurt, rejected and probably that her own aunt doesn\u2019t like her as much as Ava. You could easily have 2 flower girls. Maybe doing it together with Ava would help her not be so shy. Is your one day more important than your life long relationship with your niece?  You still have time to fix this with your niece. I would tell her you didn\u2019t realize how much it would mean to her to be a flower girl and that you love her. Tell her she can be a flower girl with Ava. Have her parents buy the dress and if she freaks out the day of tell her it\u2019s ok she doesn\u2019t have to. Again she\u2019s 7 and people are expecting way too much maturity out of a 7 year old.", "YTA. Make them both flower girls and then everyone is happy. Or give her a different job during the wedding, it\u2019s not that hard to find one or make one up.", "You should have either offered the role to both kids or *never* have practiced wedding stuff in front of the kid you chose to exclude.  That was so mean.  Expecting a 7 year old to not react to having her face rubbed in the fact that you trusted and chose a younger kid over her was unrealistic.\n\nMost weddings I've been to with children as flower girls/boys had at least kid one panic and hide. It's not a big deal.  Their parents just stay with them outside the doors and the kid(s) comfortable with the role keep walking forward.  But in that scenario you haven't targeted or excluded a child for being anxious.  A flower girl dress isn't that expensive, and the cost is worth it to not hurt children you are supposed to care about.\n\nYTA", "Um YTA, just make them both flower girls. I had 4 flower girls for this reason. My one of my favorite childhood memories is being my aunt\u2019s flower girl. \n\nBut yeah, i guess your niece\u2019s least favorite childhood memory will be when you passed her over for flower girl. \u201cIt\u2019s too close to the wedding\u201d omg grow up.", "I had all four nieces as flowers girls. Just saying. Soft YTA.", "Yta. You could have spoken to Jess and explained what was involved and let her choose for herself if she wanted to do it. You definitely should have explained why you made your decision so she didn't think it was that she was less special to you. And you could easily have a second flower girl now. Your decision may very well be rational but your actions have not been kind and have very clearly hurt a little girl's feelings. I think you should talk to her and apologise.", "ESH, and you should probably scrap the flower girl altogether now. The video of you down the aisle will be plagued by screaming, crying, and maybe some fighting. \n\nGood luck", "Your wedding, your choice. But why not let both of them be flower girls? That's what I would have done.", "NTA but seriously, you CAN have more than 1 flower girl you know? Why not just let her join your other niece?", "NTA it sounds like you made a decision you genuinely believed would make her comfortable. However think of it through the eyes of a 7 year old. All she sees is another child being chosen over her at HER Auntie\u2019s wedding for what little girls that age would see as a big grown up role. The pretty shoes and dresses are one thing, but being made to feel important is a whole different thing for children. Believe me, she will be resenting that Ava isn\u2019t your niece and was picked. Maybe you can find or create a role where she is some kind of helper to you, but won\u2019t have to be the centre of attention if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable? Even something simple like being in charge of looking after a little bag containing mirror/lipstick/tissues etc you might need on the day. That way she\u2019s included and made to feel important as her aunties helper. Plus you could gift the bag to her after. What she will remember in years to come is how included she felt.", "NTA but is it too late to get Jess a dress and have two flower girls?\n\nEdited to say it\u2019s pretty common for kids to flip out in these scenarios whether they\u2019re shy or not. Everyone just takes it in stride.", "NTA for making a choice based on comfort in large settings. \n\nI am surprised though that no one thought to buy her a dress and give her a little job as part of the wedding. Manning the gift/sign-in table, placing place cards, walking with her mom and dad down the aisle to be seated, handing out programs, etc complete with the fancy dress (which is really the issue here). \n\nI have thrown several weddings (for siblings and my own now-adult children) and we always found something for all of the kids to do so no one felt left out. They each got special clothes, a special job, etc.", "Nah. You should\u2019ve asked first to see if it was something she wanted to try to do instead of assuming. You could\u2019ve had two flower girls. \n\nShe just sees that you picked another little girl instead of her and she\u2019s jealous.", "That\u2019s hard. I had both my little cousins just to avoid this. Of course, it is your choice!", "Technically NTA as it\u2019s your wedding and your decision\n\nBut a different POV- I\u2019m the mom where one kid has been asked to be in the wedding and the younger sibling (who is attached to the older one at the hip) was not. It\u2019s created a lot of confusion on why one was picked and not the other. Not to add a cousin was also chosen and they are all close. It\u2019s a lot of feelings of being left out at a young age. When honestly we know adults don\u2019t handle being left out well- idk why we expect children to understand. As a parent, the thought is- why can\u2019t you just add them? It\u2019s like 3 minutes of participating and would make them so happy. \n\nSo while you\u2019re NTA and it\u2019s your wedding to do what you want, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d to show favoritism (which is how it\u2019s felt by the kids).", "NTA. Leave Ava as the flower girl and assign Jess a separate special assignment as the program handed-outer, or something else where she doesn\u2019t have to have the spotlight but still feels like she has a role. If she doesn\u2019t want it, then relax and enjoy your special day with one flower girl. Don\u2019t let a 7 yr old or her mom bully you (or Ava.)", "NTA but you should think of some special role for Jess so she feels included and stops being jealous. That would help redirect her energy.", "Seems likely to cause an issue but at the end of the day it's your wedding and you can do whatever the heck you want\n\nPersonally I wouldn't be keen on dealing with the potential issues of that decision but if you're cool with it then do it", "Jess likely doesn't want to be an actual flower girl in front of the crowd,  but she wants the special dress and to feel included in some way. Maybe make her the supervisor and put her in charge of getting her family to the wedding in time- with a special dress...NTA", "NTA. Just the fact that a 7 year old is behaving this way shows that she shouldn\u2019t be in the wedding. I have a 7 year old and I couldn\u2019t imagine her doing this. But if her aunt chose one of her cousins as a flower girl, I would have a talk with her about why and that auntie loves you but sometimes other people get things and we are happy for them and we can enjoy the wedding and be excited even if we don\u2019t get everything we want. That\u2019s how the 7 year old should be handled. Her parents should be having that conversation with her, but you also can. You can say \u201cI love you so much but I didn\u2019t think you would want to be in the wedding because you seem to have a lot of stage fright. But how about we get a picture together, just us at the wedding?\u201d", "At seven personality is being set in stone. No reward for bad behavior unless you wish to experience it for life or pay for therapy. No and you may want to just Nix the flower girl option", "Op why not get her a \u201cspecial dress\u201d but not force her to have the responsibility of a flower girl?  Maybe than she will feel included as well.  Or have a conversation with her and ask her what you can do for her to feel included?  If she mentions being a flower girl too, explain that you were concerned about putting so much pressure on her being in front of all those people.  Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.  Try to do something special for her or have some thing special for her just for that day so that way she feels like she was included because she got something special too, like the dress idea.  NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. I have tons of cousins. Not all of them can be the flower girl.", "NTA but I would let them both be flower girls. Yeah, Jess\u2019s reaction sucks - but she\u2019s 7, so don\u2019t worry about that too much. Let her parents deal with it. \n\nI was in a similar situation as a kid - my aunt was getting married, asked a niece on her husbands side but not me. I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t ask me. I didn\u2019t throw a fit but I was super sad - it really hurt my feelings. She ended up - maybe my parents spoke to her, I\u2019m not sure - asking me to also be a flower girl. I took it SO seriously - those petals were spread PERFECTLY lol \n\nHonestly, two is a safer bet - they have a pal for the day of and a buddy system. Since you were assuming she didn\u2019t want to do it and now she does, I would ask her to join.", "NTA, at all. Maybe Jess could get a dress with a bow and be given some small job on the day to make her feel less excluded? Generally not a fan of rewarding bad behaviour but you don't want her acting out on the day and ruining things.", "NTA but it would be very easy to add her. To avoid this very situation I had 4 of them and those cute little effers stole the show. They were the worst. They threw the flowers at the guests but since they were absolutely adorable it made everyone so happy including me. They were aged 3-5 so a 7 year old would take all of 5 minutes to teach. Finding a dress should be easy.", "NAH. You were trying to be sensitive to your niece's shyness. Unfortunately, all she sees is exclusion. She is only 7. That is very normal and age appropriate. Is there time to get her a dress and have her be part of the wedding? If she doesn't walk the aisle on the day of, she could still help with the guest book. It helps her feel included and loved without pressure.", "NTA.\n\nWeddings cost thousands of dollars and are stressful enough. There is no reason to risk Jess's meltdown or trust that her mom will intervene when it happens  And I doubt that having two flower girls would fix the issue. \n\nIs it possible to not practice in front of Jess and her mom?", "NTA. It's your wedding, and you know this child enough to know there is a possibility of her causing a problem. Wedding Days are the Olympics of Problems, so I don't blame you for making your choice.\n\nI had similar feelings about choosing a flower girl but ended up not having one at all. My brother-in-law has 3 daughters, but i have a very special bond with the oldest because she's known me for almost 16 years. I wasn't as worried about how the children would react. I was more worried about my sister making a scene because she lost custody of her daughter and couldn't have her for that day at all. Choosing my niece on my husband's side of the family would have been a sure-fire way to set her off and ruin everything.", "NTA \n\nJust because she wants it now doens't mean she won't throw a tantrum and cry at the wedding. \n\nI mean considering how she's acting rn....you made the right call.", "NTA - I think the way you made your decision was reasonable and honestly I hate parents like jess\u2019 mom. Just because your kid has a tantrum about something doesn\u2019t make it right. When I was little my sister was chosen to be a flower girl over me at a family friends wedding and I wasn\u2019t jealous or mean to my sister about it but I did want to be the flower girl. Here I am over 20 years later and my life has been just fine.\n\nEdit: also, regarding Jess\u2019 mom\u2019s comment about basing your decision on past actions - Jess just proved that she\u2019ll throw a tantrum and be horrible if she doesn\u2019t get her way. This shows you made the right decision lol", "When I had too many little nieces for all to be flower girls, I asked the oldest (7) to be a gift table attendant. She still got to wear a pretty dress with a bow, and she got to feel important to have a grown-up job instead of the traditionally \"little girl\" role. \n\nNTA but if you want to appease, perhaps a similar compromise could be found for Jess.", "NTA - it's your wedding after all, and your concerns are valid about how she might behave.\n\nBut, did you tell Jess's mom ahead of time about your decision and why?  if yes, then jess's mom is the AH.  If you didn't, then don't be surprised that she considers you the AH, and futher she could've helped manage the situation ahead of time rather than deal with the fallout.", "NTA\n\nJess' mother seems to be the type of parents who will lash out to teachers when her kids get bad grades, despite knowing her kids not doing enough school work.\n\nStay w/ Ava being flower girl, you will save yourselves and all the people attending the wedding from a nuisance.", "NTA, but you are the adult. Maybe you can \u201cfind\u201d another important role for Jess?", "Soft NTA, but it was a little short-sighted, as I could have seen this coming. What you could have done was given them both the role of flower girl, and the shy one could back out if needed, so you have flexibility. \n\nAt this point, I'd go with not rewarding her behavior to be flower girl but giving her a different role, so she feels important and loved by you.", "NTA. Jess sounds like my oldest. She might say she changed her mind, but I'm 99% sure she'd freeze up in the moment when she realius how big the crowd there is.", "Eh... I understand you are trying to protect your niece from being in the spotlight. But your niece is seeing that you're picking Ava over her. That's how a 7 year old's brain works. I would have had both be flower girls in case Jess was unable to do it day of. But at this point, it will be rewarding her for her tantrums. Maybe find a different important job for her? She wants to feel included. Have her hold the bouquet, bring you the lighter if you are lighting candles, hand out the bubbles, rice, etc., or anything that makes her feel like she is important. Or have her \"help\" you get ready without Ava. Maybe go while getting hair and makeup done, \"help\" you put on your shoes or veil. Anything that makes her feel like she is as important as Ava. She is seeing a new niece being picked over her and it's hurting her feelings but she does not know how to address them properly.", "Did you tell Jess' mom that it's YOUR wedding and not her now entitled brat child's party?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA but she will remember this forever and it will absolutely shape your relationship with her.", "I don't think you're the AH, but I need more info to decide if you could have handled it better.\n\nHow close is the wedding? How much practice is needed for Jess to be prepared? Is there an opportunity to prove that she's capable before the event?\n\nI think, if the answers to those questions allow for it, asking Jess to attempt it would only be restricted by your personal choices. And that's fine. But you have to come to terms with that. You're not an AH for not picking a shy turned jealous child to be an important party member in one of the most important days in your life. But how receptive you are to the idea will show your family how you care about them", "Well, it sounds like she\u2019s still going to make a big scene regardless.

One from each side of the family has some nice symmetry.  If they didn't want to, refused or whatever, that's cool - that's their choice.

Is there any chance that Jess' mother has been making Jess feel bad that her shyness etc. meant she wasn't asked to be a flower girl...

That said, this wasn't the best way to handle it IMO.  These girls will be your nieces forever and are old enough to remember this moment.  Weddings should be about bringing families together.

If she would have said NO, there wouldn't be an issue right now.  \n\nWe had 2 nieces and 2 nephews in our wedding.

And I know that you had good reasons for presuming that she wouldn't want to be a flower girl, or wouldn't be very good at it, but you can surely still understand why she is miserable and jealous and feeling left out. Can I recommend that you sit down with Jess and have a proper talk with her about why you didn't ask her to be a flower girl, and assure her that it's not because you love her less or because you think that 7 is too old or whatever, but because you were concerned that she wouldn't enjoy the experience and you want her to be able to have a nice time at your wedding? That doesn't necessarily mean that she gets to be a flower girl now, but you can at least value her feelings enough to be straight with her. And if you can find some meaningful but not very public job for Jess to do at the wedding, that would be a kindness - not to \"reward\" her tantrum as some have said, but to demonstrate that you understand how much you hurt her feelings by excluding her. Jess should apologise to you and to Ava, but I think that this situation wouldn't have arisen in the first place if you had talked to Jess first, so she deserves an apology/explanation too.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding. Your rules. Not everyone gets to be special, and 7 years old is old enough to start learning to handle that with grace. \n\nYes, there are big feelings. No, big feelings do not give your niece a pass for being mean to her cousin.", "NTA.  Of course you base your decision on Jess's previous actions.  She doesn't have the right personality for the job.  \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is the only way to respond to Jess's mother.  Hopefully her mother will get her a dress with a bow.", "NTA.

Because if she is known to have a melt down being a flower girl or not. You can't possibly predict the next actions she does. Because in the moment she might want it but im sure if she does become a flower girl she will feel the pressure when it happens on your wedding day and a new different kind of drama will happen. Ik kids that are overwhelming so its better to have a jealous kid in the sidelines than a kid that won't participate, walk or mid walk just full on tantrums and breaks down. So STICK TO YOUR PLANS don't give in and better to just not let the 2 girls see each other. to avoid conflict because the only reason she would act that way is because she can see it.

Tell her you know she doesn\u2019t like to have her picture taken and being flower girl means having a lot of pictures taken. Remind her of the Thanksgiving program and that she didn\u2019t want to do that, being a flower girl is a lot like that and means she has to walk in front of a lot of people and you know she doesn\u2019t like to do things like that. Tell her these are the reasons I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to do it, but I was wrong to assume without asking.

Maybe emphasize that if she is a flower girl she has to wear the dress YOU picked out, but if she isn\u2019t she gets pretty dress SHE picks out. \n\nTHEN, tell her that it is ok to have big emotions and sometime people say thing or do things they don\u2019t mean or hurt people when they are having big emotions but when that happens you need to apologize (just like you did).

Happy for the couple and everything. The one where the Uncle was supposed to run a slide show, and it took about 15 minutes of us all waiting through the IT issues? Had a blast and everyone got a chuckle out of it. The one where the dog was the ring bearer, but he was vocally unhappy that someone else took his leash for the rest of the ceremony? Absolutely awesome. Best wedding ceremony ever. The one where a thunderstorm took out the lights, and someone spilled red wine (accidentally) on the bride\u2019s dress, but she danced until the early morning hours anyway? Best reception - and maybe even all around wedding - I\u2019ve ever attended. \n\nIt seems like a lot of brides want a recreation of prom, where they are definitely the prom queen. That doesn\u2019t make for a good celebration of the relationship OR the commitments being made. The best weddings are just like what you want your life to be: structurally planned, with allowances for unforeseen events, and full of acceptance and laughter for everything that goes wrong, and everything that goes right.\n\nAll this to say: a flower girl that doesn\u2019t make it is a tiny, tiny thing.", "If she runs off an isle her parents would be very negligent", "Yeah, I think about that guy often.  It was such a bold choice and did not fit the vibe at all lol.", "That is an adorable story!  Little Man feeling proud!\n\nWhen my brother got married, my daughter was 4, and my SIL had a niece who was also 4.  They both got chosen as flower girls, with the same idea as you, \u201cthese two might both back out!\u201d\n\nBoth girls were THERE FOR IT, so much so that the other girl was so excited she was grabbing rose petals by the FISTFUL instead of \u201csprinkling\u201d, and ran out of petals a third of the way down the aisle. My daughter shared her basket, and they managed to get at least a couple petals down to the very end.  Everyone clapped and they both felt like rock stars!  \n\nGet the seven year old to apologize to the five year old for her very bad behavior, Auntie OP apologizes to 7yo for making her feel like she wasn\u2019t wanted, and everyone grows as human beings and the two flower girls (maybe) walk down the aisle together.", "Maybe OP could ask to sit down with Jess (with mom present) and explain. apologize for assuming what Jess wants & excluding her, and say that she cares about Jess but she guessed wrong on this. Just tell her she's loved and OP is sorry. When an adult who cares about them apologizes and takes responsibility, it's powerful. \n\nDepending on how that goes it could lead the way for OP to talk to Jess about her actions being mean. Jess acted how many seven year olds might act in an unfair situation, but OP could ask Jess to help her fix what happened (like, if Jess gets it that what she did was wrong, help Jess talk to Ava to ask if she is okay, hopefully apologize, etc). Maybe if Jess can show that she can turn it around and be responsible, show she's sorry, OP can open the opportunity up for her to be a flower girl too and emphasize that this is a team effort and if she can be kind to others especially Ava, OP would like to have her on her wedding day team. \n\nIf Jess and/or her mom aren't receptive, then that is their choice but OP would have communicated in a healthy manner. They will remember that someday. \n\nInstead of writing off a big memory as ruined and have Jess just excluded and hurting (and hurting younger cousin), why not make this a teachable moment and really help the kids by example-- both how to handle when you made a poor choice, and what family and marriage is supposed to be all about? That would be a really powerful memory IMHO.", "I think OP was hoping to avoid a scene before it started. Because if she did try to make the other kid a flower girl from the get go people would then probably be giving her beef for trying to put the kid in a situation that everything up to that point was indicating she\u2019d likely be uncomfortable in.", "[deleted]", "The bad behavior is a reaction to just her little sister getting favor. She\u2019s 7. She\u2019s excluded. It\u2019s kinda what 7 year old do. Why create drama instead of asking the girls? Having two flower girls? OP is the drama here.", "Meh.  If Jess\u2019s feelings are as hurt as OP is making them out to be, then OP has inadvertently made one of those core memories that we all have from our childhood, something (good or bad) that we never forget.  \n\nIt\u2019s OP\u2019s wedding, and ultimately it can be whatever she wants it be, but for Jess it\u2019ll probably go down as the day Auntie OP didn\u2019t want her.\n\nIf Jess needs to learn about being rejected by loved ones, then OP needs to learn about showing compassion.", "Or it will teach her that the adults in her life know how to recognize when they've made a mistake and hurt somebody's feelings, and adjust their behavior accordingly. She's seven, she doesn't need to accept rejection from adults who should care about her.", "OP made no mention of who was paying for what, but if cost was an issue, I suspect she would have said, \u201cWe can only afford to buy one dress for a flower girl, so I picked Ava because Jess struggles with shyness/social stress.\u201d", "People here hating on poor Jess for acting like a hurt, disappointed seven year old!  Your suggestion to ASK Jess what she felt about the IDEA of being a flower girl at the same time she asked Ava is spot on.  Jess might have Noped right out from the start.\n\nI\u2019m sure most of Jess\u2019s jealousy/hurt is because Jess feels that Auntie OP doesn\u2019t like her now.", "Yes, but they aren't throwing a wedding and then throwing the flower girl with the non flower girl to watch her go through all the motions\n\nNiece is old enough to know her aunt chose the other girl over her, as well. Aunt is playing arson with that relationship. Kid isn't likely to adore her so much after this because she's likely hurt and acting out. If OP wants a good relationship with her niece, yeah, she's gotta figure something out.", "I wouldn't say it's her fault necessarily.. like if she's not been taught that such behavior is wrong then she wouldn't realize it's not ok? Like yes it's bad behavior but you have to teach kids that right? If she knows and still acted like that then she must need stronger boundaries/consequences but this is a lot about the parents too.. kids don't just magically understand everything about how to behave", "Here's the thing- she's acting out because she's hurt. She doesn't know how to express that. You can curb the behavior, but you still have a hurt 7 year old, who is then going to be super internalizing feelings. Someone says she should learn how to deal with rejection- rejection isn't supposed to come from your own family when you are 7. \n\nAva should have never been the flower girl once Jess was disqualified if they are spending that much time together. They can't be the only kids OP knows. OP honestly created the dynamic but isn't dealing with the fallout", "I honestly have no idea why people are trying to argue with you about this. Tantrum \u2260 reward is parenting 101\u2026 especially when a child is showing very aggressive tendencies in that tantrum.", "Well that\u2019s not what I was implying but whatever.  \n\nA 7 year gets a reward or consequence in the moment. If OP had agreed to have her be in the wedding in the moment just to stop a tantrum then yes that\u2019s a reward. \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t sound like she was throwing a fit with the purpose of getting into the wedding. They were practicing wedding stuff instead of front of her which is so mean. \n\nOf course teach her and every kid ways to express their feelings. Which takes a lot of time and practice. The most emotionally mature 7 year old is going to act like a 7 year old. At 7 both you and I probably had times we were little assholes.", "Well sorry your parents overreacted. \n\nPlus even without this- she wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to be a flower girl anyway. So the lesson is \u201chey that thing you were never allowed to do that\u2019s happening next year? Well you were bad so now you are DOUBLE not invited to! Think about that.\u201d", "I hope OP sees this. A baby will probably cry. Someone at my cousins wedding had leave early ceremony because of a sudden gushing bloody nose. A friend had a seizure at my sister\u2019s wedding (he was fine). Everything was handled with grace.", "Based on OPs responses I don\u2019t have a ton of faith in her parents handling a meltdown or her running off well.", "My now step daughter and my niece shared flower girl duties, and they were adorable in their matching dresses. They have been best pals ever since (both in their mid 20s now). My niece would\u2019ve done it either way, but my step daughter was a bit skittish and prone to tears at the time, and it helped her to have someone by her side.", "That seems like a very great idea. I hope OP tries this or something very like this!", "7 year old and 5 year old have different moms.", "Not little sister. The two girls are not related.", "They're not sisters, and would only be cousins by marriage", "Try reading thoroughly", "This sub hates children and cannot understand their actions at all. It's so funny to me how many people are saying that Jess should've been mature and understood the rejection. She's fucking 7, y'all.", "Communication skills, kinda necessary in a marriage. All OP needed to do was ask.", "That's a good point. I had a situation this morning where someone wasn't responding to my message who usually would and I had a really complicated mess of emotions that took me a few hours to identify the trigger and what feelings were coming up. And as I was talking myself through that I remembered that the person in question is on vacation and my fears that their lack of response was a reflection on them not actually caring about me were completely and totally unfounded (well, more completely unfounded than I already knew them to be)\n\nAnd I did a really good job of going about my day while having those feelings, eventually registering that they were persistent and distressing, taking a couple minutes to reflect, figure that out, then let my body calm down from the emotional stress while I went about the rest of my day as normal\n\nBut I'm 27, and even a few years ago I wouldn't have handled that so competently. 7 year olds have much less life experience, emotional coping skills, impulse control, awareness of how their behavior affects others, words to express their feelings, emotional tolerance window, etc. I wonder what it might look like to both have empathy for Jess and reassure her that she's still loved and valued as much as Ava, while also pointing out that her behavior made ppl upset and less inclined to give her special opportunities", "Many posters have a warped view of the maturity of a 7 year old. She\u2019s a little kid and the 5 year old was parading in front of her. Most 7 year olds I know wouldn\u2019t be mature in that situation.", ">rejection isn't supposed to come from your own family when you are 7. \n\n\nExcept that's just life. OP and other aunts and uncles are extended family not your immediate family. Extended family isn't under the obligation to always include every nibbling at every event some of the nibblings will be at. As long as the child is still treated well then they need to learn they won't be involved in everything even in extended family events.", "Why? Why should it be offered to both girls? OP is under no obligation to offer it to either girl. She picked not only the one who appeared more comfortable with the situation but the one who appeared more capable. Nothing the 7 year old had done before or apparently since that decision appears to have made her seem a good fit for OP's day. Unless the mom of the little girl is paying for the wedding, she has no say in who the flower girl is. \n   It's not a punishment to not be picked for the role. If this were a school play and she pulled that shit because she didn't like her part, I doubt it would be considered a punishment to still not get that part. I get that a wedding is more personal, though maybe not to a 7 year old. But it's not their wedding anymore than another kid's birthday is their party.", "You bet I did, and I never once got rewarded for it, which is my entire point.", "My parents didn't overreact, they actually parented.\n\nThey didn't allow me to act like a fool because I didn't get what I wanted. \n\nAlso, she's 7 not 5, this is the time when they should learn that actions have consequences and when to learn that shit isn't going to be fair or you're not always going to be picked.\n\nThe people on here wants participation award fairness and don't see that this is not the right event for that.", "I think you missed my point", "My bad. Point still stands.", "Point still stands. She was excluded because she\u2019s shy and no one thought a conversation should have happened.", "\ud83d\ude44 already addressed sister misunderstanding in other comment.

She\u2019s obviously deeply hurt. This isn\u2019t some Machiavellian plot.", "You can give consequences without \u201craising hell.\u201d You can recognize something isn\u2019t ok while recognizing it\u2019s also not atypical. You can teach your kids skills while realizing they have little kid brains that don\u2019t work like an adult brain because they still need time to cook. \n\nIf at 7 you never called a sibling a baby, or grabbed a toy out of your siblings hand because they weren\u2019t sharing, or cried because you were sad then good for you.", "I'd agree, but the child has a known issue of getting overly hyped up for an event, panicking, having a meltdown, and running away. Not something that'd have been good here, especially because she'd have said yes, been unmanageable, and likely reacted just as poorly to the other flower girl doing what she couldn't.\n\nNot to mention the 7 year old's mother won't even make her apologize to the 5 year old, and won't talk to her about how to handle big emotions.", ">\"Not being offered a special job as a child that your equal was offered, because adults made assumptions about you\u201d\n\nAssumptions based off previous behavior of having melt downs in situations like this, and as OP mentioned in a comment, she doesn't just freak out, she full on rabbits and runs off. She's demonstrated that she can't handle the task, just because she wants to doesn't change that. \n\nIt's not punishing the child who's consistently shown they aren't up for things like this, its simply choosing the child who's consistently shown they are.", "Except they aren't equal in that past instances have proven Jess doesn't do well in situations like this (it's not her fault just how she is and that is fine) but whose to say she won't have a melt down IN the aisle? \n\nI'm just saying at that age they will see getting what they wanted after a tantrum as (ok here's how to get them to cave). Also seven is old enough to know a tantrum and calling another kid names is not acceptable!", "Her role is to site in the stands with the other guest and watch the flower girl walk down the isle", "Also stop trying to have a perfect wedding. Perfection is boring. Maybe the flower girl freaks out and has to have a talking-to by her mom outside the church. Is it really the end of the world?", "I feel like you're either misunderstanding my entire point, or intentionally not getting it.\n\nI'm not saying Punish the kid. Never said that. In fact, you are with your talk of consequences.\n\nI said \"Don't reward the kid for the tantrum\". Not rewarding someone is not a punishment.\n\nI also said that I'd explain to the girl that Hissy fits aren't the way to express her emotions and help teach her more healthy ways.\n\nSo where am I *not* providing understanding?", "I have actually worked with kids and I disagree.

I knew at 7 that sort of behavior was not acceptable she's old enough to be aware how she acted was wrong. If they affirm her behaving this way here she'll do it elsewhere where it won't be tolerated (ex school)\n\nC) the kid wasn't getting it in the first place they aren't really taking something away. They can use this as a teaching moment that life isn't always equal. We don't always get picked and that's OK. \n\nIf they really.feel the need they could maybe give her a less high maintenence roll but I'd be wary of even that.", "Why do people infantilize kids and then question why they act horrible later?\n\nThey're not stupid or anything.
