It\u2019s a compromise that lets everyone have their own way.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's problematic that Eliza would refuse to have her cake made by a gay man because it would upset her parents, and she wants them to pay for the wedding.

Telling your friend \"sorry mate but my inlaws are raging homophobes so I won't buy you a cake\"? You'll lose a friend for sure lol. Stand your grounds and help your friend's business. If her parents learn that he's gay, well, yes, and? He's not cooking with his sexuality, ffs. Who cares if he's gay or not as long as the cake is pretty and good.", "NTA.

Your fiance's excuse about them being too old is bullshit - the old ladies at my grans bingo club adopted my best friend after he was kicked out for coming out of the closet. My gran was the most accepting crazy lady I've ever known and she was 89 when she passed.

Eliza's request IS weird. \n\nI mean, is she thinking that her parents are going to demand a list of vendors with their corresponding sexuality listed? \n\nIs she afraid that her parents will think the baker had hot gay sex on the cake before serving?\n\nIt seems like it is ELIZA who doesn't like your friend and she is using her parents as an excuse.", "NTA. If they\u2019re so homophobic that you can\u2019t even get a cake from a business owned by your friend because he\u2019s a gay man, then their homophobia isn\u2019t actually being kept to themselves and it is harming your friend and his business.", "INFO:\n\nyou could afford a smaller scale event without the money from her parents so why do you not just pay for the cake out of the money you are saving by having them pay for the rest?  They don't have to eat it if they want to be petty.", "NTA. Anyone can change at any age, she's just making excuses for their bigotry.

Maybe she is not okay with a gay owned business.", "NTA...but I would absolutely be reconsidering this relationship. I'm a lesbian. I've got nieces I've never even seen because I'm a lesbian and my brother is homophobic. It's hard.", "Esh. You know what making excuses for bigotry make you. So why are you marrying one?", "NTA.\n\n\nYou do, however, need to have some VERY serious conversations with your fiancee about her attitudes toward important things like this.  It sounds rather much like she is masking her own bigotry under the shade of her parents' more open stance.\n\n\nIs this something you feel will negatively affect your ongoing relationship?  I know it would end mine.  Kinda seems to me that you have a lot to figure out in a short time frame, considering you are planning the wedding.", "NTA. \n\nthis will get more and more difficult to be around the longer the relationship continues. Make sure to set your boundaries firmly and NOT. GIVE. IN. \n\nyou support the LGBTQ community, and that's amazing. It doesn't affect you to change your cake order, but it will destroy your friendship and take all that talk about being an ally and throw it down the drain.", "NTA. OP, stop fooling yourself about Eliza. She may not be as homophobe as her parents, but she still is. Or are not that good person if it doesnt bother her to stay close to them, let them pay for her wedding and is against the cake from your gay friend because will upset her parents.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why your fianc\u00e9e is acting like her parents are going to find out he\u2019s gay- or why that would affect the cake honestly. Kind of upsets me for you, because she needs to realize this is your friend, and his sexuality has nothing to do with the cake. she\u2019s not very nice.", "NTA\n\nWhile your reasoning is sound it may not be best to start a marriage with a disagreement. Also how would they find out that your friend is gay? Do they hire PIs to scope out all the wedding services?", "NTA, are the parents going through all the vendors life histories to make sure none of them, and no one who works for/with them is gay or otherwise objectionable somehow? That seems like a very exhausting way to live. Do they even know the baker is gay?", "NTA\nEven though they supposedly \u201caren\u2019t that homophobic\u201d, they still couldn\u2019t keep their political beliefs out of ordering a damn cake.

I couldn\u2019t tell you the sexuality of anyone who provided services at my wedding. \n\nHonestly, even if it did, you would have to be pretty hard core homophobic for something like that to cause an issue. If it did, I think it makes sense to sit everyone down and explain that you are thankful they are paying for everything and you want them to be a part of the wedding and your life, but this is a problem with them not you. Tell them about your friend and your history together and why it\u2019s important to you. In the end, draw a hard line if you have to.

However, are you sure this is the family you want to join? Your fiance is enabling and excusing this behavior. Her parents aren't too old to change. You're only too old when you're dead.

It seems to me that like what everyone else already mentioned, Eliza is homophobic, but just better at hiding it or perhaps more \u201cmild\u201d with her homophobia. This is just an assumption, but the fact that Eliza\u2019s parents knew that your baker friend was gay implies that perhaps Eliza brought it up in a conversation that she had with her parents regarding getting the cake from your baker friend, which is totally unnecessary. NTA in any way at all, but you might want to have a talk with her. This is the woman that you\u2019re gonna be marrying and hopefully spending the rest of your life together. If you guys plan to have a child and they come out as gay for example, what\u2019s going to happen then?
