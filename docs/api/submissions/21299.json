You get to support your friend\u2019s business, they don\u2019t have to support a gay baker, and everyone gets to eat great cake at your wedding.  It\u2019s a compromise that lets everyone have their own way.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's problematic that Eliza would refuse to have her cake made by a gay man because it would upset her parents, and she wants them to pay for the wedding. Is having a big wedding more important than basic decency?\n\nAnd, is this the one and only time that Eliza will allow her parents to influence important decisions (that should be made by the two of you), for material benefit?

They wouldn't want to support a bakery even if it's one of your friends' just because the owner is *check notes* oh yes! Gay.\n\nNTA. Can you imagine? Telling your friend \"sorry mate but my inlaws are raging homophobes so I won't buy you a cake\"? You'll lose a friend for sure lol. Stand your grounds and help your friend's business. If her parents learn that he's gay, well, yes, and? He's not cooking with his sexuality, ffs. Who cares if he's gay or not as long as the cake is pretty and good.", "NTA. But I would question this relationship. If you\u2019re planning on having children, what if one of your child was gay? And do you really want that to be the only reason she starts standing up to her parents? \n\nIs your friend even invited? Have you checked the seating and invitation plan? She\u2019s too afraid to get a cake ordered from him, imagine if he was at the wedding?", "NTA. You say Eliza isn't homophobic but she is discriminating your friend. \n\nIt also makes no sense to me that Eliza would think to change the cake order whilst not worrying about your friend attending the wedding.", "\"aren't not homophobic\" right. You are perhaps not not being dishonest with yourself about the problem.\n\nMaybe she's less bigoted than her parents, but she's fine with enabling their bigotry. That seems like a much more serious issue than cake.", "Are Eliza\u2019s parents vetting all the wedding vendors for possible gayness? If not, how would Sam\u2019s identity even come up? He is making a cake. The cleaning crew at the wedding could be gay - how do they plan to screen for that? \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIt turns out it's not not just your in laws that are homophobic", "NTA. Unless it's a giant rainbow cake and gay people jump out of it and yell, \"This cake was made by a gay person!\" I'm not sure I understand what the problem is. Are they doing a deep dive into all businesses you've hired? Gosh, I hope none of the caterers are gay and breathe on the food.\n\n\"Too old to change\" is such a lazy bullshit excuse. Does she regularly defend them or is it just about the money?", "NTA - they clearly are doing harm and are not keeping their opinions to themselves. Also you\u2019re engaged to a homophobe apologist.", "NTA but honestly rethink this whole wedding. Your fiance's excuse about them being too old is bullshit - the old ladies at my grans bingo club adopted my best friend after he was kicked out for coming out of the closet. My gran was the most accepting crazy lady I've ever known and she was 89 when she passed. Your fiance making excuses to appease her parents is a pathetic excuse, no money should be worth someone's identity and the fact she's even suggesting it makes me wonder if she shares the same views but hides it better.", "NTA but GF is a homophobe as well, she just hides it better.", "NTA. I agree with you, the bakery owner's sexuality would likely never come up in conversation anyway so why would it even matter. Fiance is trying everything in her power to get the perfect wedding and nitpicking.", "NTA. I have yet to come up with a scenario where you talk about ordering wedding cake and her parents ask if the owner is gay\u2026 I don\u2019t think that conversation has ever existed.

Clear things up with your fianc\u00e9e before you go any further with the planning.", "NTA. Clearly your wife is ok with her parents homophobia. Is that ok with you? Is that the type of person you want to be with for the rest of your life?", "NTA, don't change it, and I have a surprise for you! Your fianc\u00e9e is also homophobic, if she wasn't she wouldn't care, she would just not tell her parents the sexuality of the bakers :)", "NTA. Eliza's request IS weird. \n\nI mean, is she thinking that her parents are going to demand a list of vendors with their corresponding sexuality listed? \n\nIs she afraid that her parents will think the baker had hot gay sex on the cake before serving?\n\nIt seems like it is ELIZA who doesn't like your friend and she is using her parents as an excuse.", "NTA. If they\u2019re so homophobic that you can\u2019t even get a cake from a business owned by your friend because he\u2019s a gay man, then their homophobia isn\u2019t actually being kept to themselves and it is harming your friend and his business.", "INFO:\n\nyou could afford a smaller scale event without the money from her parents so why do you not just pay for the cake out of the money you are saving by having them pay for the rest?  They don't have to eat it if they want to be petty.", "NTA. Anyone can change at any age, she's just making excuses for their bigotry. It's your wedding, not the old bigots wedding, so you and your fiance make the decisions. It's nice that they're paying, but that doesn't make them entitled to control your wedding.", "NTA, just order the cake from Sam and see if they actually keep their opinions to themselves. If they were to make an issue of it you and your fianc\u00e9e should just pay for the cake and show you are not like them.

They may not ever change, but it\u2019s not because of their ages.", "Just a quick question:  What first attracted you to your homophobic fianc\u00e9e?\n\nJust asking", "NTA. I would question if the fiancee is actually okay with the friend and just putting it on her parents. Maybe she is not okay with a gay owned business.", "NTA...but I would absolutely be reconsidering this relationship. I'm a lesbian. I've got nieces I've never even seen because I'm a lesbian and my brother is homophobic. It's hard.", "Esh. You know what making excuses for bigotry make you. So why are you marrying one?", "NTA.\n\n\nYou do, however, need to have some VERY serious conversations with your fiancee about her attitudes toward important things like this.  It sounds rather much like she is masking her own bigotry under the shade of her parents' more open stance.\n\n\nIs this something you feel will negatively affect your ongoing relationship?  I know it would end mine.  Kinda seems to me that you have a lot to figure out in a short time frame, considering you are planning the wedding.", "NTA. \n\nthis will get more and more difficult to be around the longer the relationship continues. Make sure to set your boundaries firmly and NOT. GIVE. IN. \n\nyou support the LGBTQ community, and that's amazing. It doesn't affect you to change your cake order, but it will destroy your friendship and take all that talk about being an ally and throw it down the drain.", "NTA. OP, stop fooling yourself about Eliza. She may not be as homophobe as her parents, but she still is. Or are not that good person if it doesnt bother her to stay close to them, let them pay for her wedding and is against the cake from your gay friend because will upset her parents.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why your fianc\u00e9e is acting like her parents are going to find out he\u2019s gay- or why that would affect the cake honestly. Kind of upsets me for you, because she needs to realize this is your friend, and his sexuality has nothing to do with the cake. she\u2019s not very nice.", "NTA\n\nWhile your reasoning is sound it may not be best to start a marriage with a disagreement. Also how would they find out that your friend is gay? Do they hire PIs to scope out all the wedding services?", "NTA, are the parents going through all the vendors life histories to make sure none of them, and no one who works for/with them is gay or otherwise objectionable somehow? That seems like a very exhausting way to live. Do they even know the baker is gay?", "NTA\nEven though they supposedly \u201caren\u2019t that homophobic\u201d, they still couldn\u2019t keep their political beliefs out of ordering a damn cake. I can somewhat understand that your fianc\u00e9 just wants to appease your parents so they\u2019ll pay for it, but c\u2019mon man. Being gay should have nothing to do with a cake.", "I'm guessing she is homophobic and using her parents as cover.", "Seems like it shouldn\u2019t be a thing that comes up in normal conversation. I couldn\u2019t tell you the sexuality of anyone who provided services at my wedding. \n\nHonestly, even if it did, you would have to be pretty hard core homophobic for something like that to cause an issue. If it did, I think it makes sense to sit everyone down and explain that you are thankful they are paying for everything and you want them to be a part of the wedding and your life, but this is a problem with them not you. Tell them about your friend and your history together and why it\u2019s important to you. In the end, draw a hard line if you have to. Your friend will bake the cake for your wedding and that\u2019s non-negotiable. Hopefully that wedding is to their daughter.", "NTA - Your future in-laws need to chill and eat some delicious cake.

You can protest but your fiance won't back you just like she won't back the cake purchase. You could purchase the cake yourself but they in turn could say they won't pay for the rest of the wedding and your fiance may call it off bc her focus is a fancy wedding.\n\nNTA but you may need to have a deep convo with your fiance.", "You are Nta for not changing your cake. However, are you sure this is the family you want to join? Your fiance is enabling and excusing this behavior. Her parents aren't too old to change. You're only too old when you're dead. People can always change if they want.", "YTA. Also, age is not an excuse. Stonewall was literally 50 years ago. They\u2019ve had time to get with progress and acceptance.", "Tell her it isn\u2019t like he\u2019s sticking his dick in the cake. \n\nWhy would they need to know the orientation of the baker?", "First off, why is Eliza further enabling her parents homophobic behaviour? It seems to me that like what everyone else already mentioned, Eliza is homophobic, but just better at hiding it or perhaps more \u201cmild\u201d with her homophobia. NTA in any way at all, but you might want to have a talk with her. This is the woman that you\u2019re gonna be marrying and hopefully spending the rest of your life together. If you guys plan to have a child and they come out as gay for example, what\u2019s going to happen then?

I hope you support them and protect them from that entire family.", "there are red flags, in this story.\n\nEliza wants a big wedding but as a couple you can't afford it.  So Eliza's parents will pay for it, but there are strings attached.\n\nYou only wanted to have your friend, the baker, make the cake.

This is one.\n\nYour in laws are not keeping their feelings to themselves. Their behaviour appears to require their children to discriminate against friends on the basis of sexuality.
