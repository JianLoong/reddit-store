I think you need to seek help from a responsible adult who will help you. If someone says no then pursue it regardless with the next adult. What is happening to you is not ok. There are also things like menstrual cups that you can order. The outlay is a little expensive but they last 10 years.

One thing you might want to consider is a menstrual cup.  You can get one for 20-30 dollars, it's cheaper than buying tampons each month.  If you message me your email, I'll send you an Amazon card.  I'm sorry you're having to deal with this", "In a pinch you can go to a gas station and use the paper toweling folded into a pad.
