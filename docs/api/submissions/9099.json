We'd been in that gap where we made too much for medicaid, but could not possibly pay (at the time, it's more now) $900/mo for health insurance for 2 young adults.  Checked my tax return for 2014, we made $18,900 from my husband's full-time, min wage job at the time.  Health insurance cost our *entire* income but without the expansion we'd have been making too much for medicaid still, lol.  I couldn't afford to pay for medical care/prescriptions while uninsured, either, the money just was not there.\n\nPeriods were heavy, painful, and made me sick.  I could not safely use tampons.  We'd be paying almost $20 at the grocery store for a pack of 28 overnights pads, which went fast.  I used them for daily use and had to replace them every 3-4 hours or they'd *overfill* and leak.  I often used them longer anyway because at the time I wasn't working anyway (funny how that can change with access to basic healthcare needs addressed) and though my husband was *awesome* and understood it was a necessity and did not resent it at all, I felt bad about the money.\n\nI knew they were heavy, but didn't realize *how* unusually heavy until I saw my doctor.  I thought \"Overnights\" was flagrant false advertising.  If I dared to sleep for 5 hours without waking up, I'd have the pad soaked through and blood pooled up at my lower back.  So much extra laundry and the expense that too entails, all to still have stained underwear, pajamas, and sheets that I could not afford to replace and it would have been pointless to anyway.  It was humiliating.\n\nAnd of course there's the extra toilet paper use when periods are that heavy, too, so yet more expense.

If I were a cashier I would not say anything about it.\n\nWhen I was in middle school I was staying with my cousin and her family and I was just too embarrassed to ask for period products even though I got my period unexpectedly. I brought some but it was a real struggle and I embarrassingly bled through my clothes once. It was horrible. I know this isn't the same thing, but you'd think anyone would know better than to make a young woman feel weird about acquiring period products.", "In Scotland you get free period products in all public buildings by law", "Mate I couldn't agree more having my daughters made me look into to all this the way women and girls are treated for natural bodily functions is just wrong don't get me started on the tax implications as they are classed as luxury items like how is a tampon a luxury item makes my blood boil", "This is the way!", "So it\u2019s a charity box, that\u2019s in most schools, libraries, clinics, and pharmacies, so if you can\u2019t afford period products they will give you some, usually they\u2019re collected from supermarkets, and people have donated to them and the charity who make the red boxes supply them around the country. It\u2019s to escape period poverty", "It's also a lot harder to forget a pad is in your underwear than that a tampon is inside you...\n\nPlus, TMI, but tampons are more prone to factory malfunctions. I'm not sure how it happened, but one time as a teen, I used what appeared to be a normal tampon, but when it was time to change, it hurt way more than it should. I'm pretty sure I gave myself some serious bodily trauma, because when I pulled it out, it turned out to be 3 tampons that had been packaged with one string inside of one applicator. There was no way for me to have known, and it was my first tampon of that period, so it wasn't a matter of me forgetting. \n\nWas too embarrassed to tell my mom or go to the doctor about it, but I have nightmares about that pain, sometimes.", "Everybody else in the comments already said it but NTA, i\u2019m so sorry every adult in your life that should\u2019ve stepped up hasn\u2019t. For you to even think you\u2019re the one in the wrong is actually sickening and a real sign that this kind of treatment from people that are supposed to provide and protect you isn\u2019t new. I\u2019ve seen people speculate you\u2019re from the uk but it seems you haven\u2019t confirmed it (for your own safety i imagine which is perfectly understandable) but there are a lot of programmes we can get you in touch with. Not just for the issue of period poverty but providing you support while still allowing you to stay under the custody of your father (because i imagine you don\u2019t want to lose complete contact with your little brothers if this isn\u2019t the case then your options actually increase of us being able to get you some actual help. I do however realise a lot of these are more long term solutions so for short term help. You can go to a pharmacy or urgent care centre for a short supply, you can also go to your doctors office who would probably supply you with pads also as well as get you referred to a social prescriber which is something you would definitely benefit from. Most importantly pls understand this is abuse and you have done absolutely nothing to warrant the way you are being treated.", "Have you thought about buying a Diva Cup (or similar product)? It's a better investment.", "NTA \n\nI suggest you try a menstrual cup though. You won't need to continue to have others fail you every month. \n\nProducts are too expensive for the amount needed and how often.", "NTA, OP...but if you read these comments, you need to set up that Amazon wish list and post it for us. We'll send you enough stuff to get you through menopause. LOL", "I will buy you a menstrual cup if you need", "NTA. As your Dad, he\u2019s responsible for your basic needs at minimum. Not providing your daughter with feminine hygiene products is *neglect* just as not providing you kids with toilet paper (or a bidet) would be neglect.\n\nYou could report this as neglect, but I wonder if a local clinic or Planned Parenthood or something would just give these away for free to those in need so you don\u2019t have to BEG you parents for freaking tampons!", "Very clearly NTA! In addition to all the great advice here, I would recommend looking into getting a menstrual cup. They are made of medical grade silicon and last for a really long time, and this way you wouldn\u2019t  have to worry about constantly finding supplies. They are comfortable, easy to use and safer, with no risk of toxic shock syndrome. Also much better for the environment! Diva cup is the one I would personally recommend, but there are several different brands and styles out there. Good luck!", "OP please set up some sort of Amazon wishlist for feminine products and PM the share link to me. It's easy, and nobody can see your address or anything so it's safe. Your parents are assholes and as a female this infuriates me", "NTA but seriously look into a menstrual cup. A one time expense that is reusable! In the USA they typically cost ~$20-25. Might be a great option for you so you don\u2019t have to have this fight with your dad (or the school secretary) every month", "OP I\u2019m hopeful by now you have the items you need. If you don\u2019t and you\u2019re open to a cup as opposed to tampons, I\u2019d happily pay for one. I think it may be a nice long term option for you that is very cost effective. \n\nI\u2019m sure that this goes without saying but you are not the AH.", "Ok, love.  I\u2019m in Harrogate.  If you\u2019re anywhere near, drop me a line and I\u2019ll sort you out.  I\u2019m old enough to be your granny and I can vividly remember being embarrassed and my parents were lovely.  If you don\u2019t want to meet me, we can arrange for me to leave you some tampons where you can find them.  \n\n\nNone of this is your fault and none of this should be your problem.", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this OP. If you\u2019re in Australia I\u2019d gladly send some feminine products your way.", "Do people understand that us women DO NOT GAVE A SAY WHEN IT COMES TO PERIODS?! All the men in the world would be horrified if we just started bleeding everywhere and start calling us dirty and disgusting. Period pads are BASIC needs it\u2019s necessities! You need pads or tampons. Your parents are completely out of touch with reality.", "NTA and allow me, your new internet mom, to speak to your dad. I'll sort him out...right upside his head.", "Happy to help if you set up a wishlist or venmo.  NTA, you asked more than once because the need wasn't met and is a very real need", "I do prefer those period cups. Because you just buy them once and they last for years. No need to invest money every month.

Update us when ready.", "My dad was a good dad, but he really failed hard in this department. The subject of periods and sexuality were such awkward topics for him, that he made it into awkward subjects for us. He was an older, single father of 6, also dealing with massive depression.
