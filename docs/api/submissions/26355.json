We are extremely close, and I love her to death for the wonderful person she is, however. About five years ago we had a falling out because she had an affair with my childhood friend John (30M), who was dating someone else at the time. I got pretty mad at both of them for doing something so dishonest and putting me in the middle of this, as I was the one who introduced them. Over time with a lot of conversations we were able to save our friendship, John was honest to his gf, and they broke up, and Laura promised she wouldn't do something like that again.\n\nFast-forward to 3 months ago, we're at a music festival, and she runs into an ex coworker of hers who is there with three more friends. We have a blast, and after the concert we hit a bar, and I'm the first one to go home, of course I asked her how is she getting home before getting my Uber and her friend says he can take her home. The next day she asks me if someone named Wendy has seen my social media stories, I go check and confirmed that yes, and I asked her who was that, and she tells me that this is her friends wife, I ask why is she looking at my stories, and she tells me that they had sex the night before after he took her home. When I ask if he she knew he was married she says yes, but asks me not to say anything because although she doesn't regret anything, she feels terrible. Then I say that I love her no matter what, but I'm very disappointed in her.\n\nAfter this conversation she got very distant, and when I tried to talk to her, she said that she feels I judge her too much, and that's why sometimes she holds information from me, which is kinda hurtful to me, because that makes me feel as if my friendship and opinion are not important to her. I told her that I didn't regret what I said, and that if she does something wrong I'm going to be there for her, but I will not support that behavior, and as her friend her actions affect me and I should be able to express how the things she does make me feel about her. I did make the commitment to wait until she feels better before expressing my opinion and I thought that that was it, but a few weeks ago we were hanging out with friends and I went to the kitchen pretty quick, when I came back they were talking about something, I asked what the conversation was about and everyone changed the subject, which made me realized she is withholding information about her life from me, and makes me wonder if I'm in the wrong here, and indeed I am being too judgy when she just needs someone make her feel better or should I just realize that I lost a friend and move on.", "created_utc": 1694037629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bxiu8/aita_for_telling_my_friend_i_was_disappointed_in/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We look at what others say and do and reach conclusions about their character.  She is withholding information from you, which is common sense for her since she knows that you hold a different set of standards than her.  \n\nI think that you missed one other thing though.

Part of being a good friend is to hold others accountable by making them aware of their actions. Having sex with someone who is married or in a committed monogamous of is wrong.

Too many people would rather people please and go along with whatever their friends do. \nIn today's day and age we can set boundaries and say hey, I don't want to be friends with someone who sleeps with married people. \n\nYou're doing the right thing...she'll thank you later.", "NTA - what she is doing is gross and she knows it.

You can like her, but she's a crappy person", "NAH. \n\nNobody is to be commended for hooking up while married or with someone who is married. \n\nYou are fine in what you said. \n\nHer feeling upset over doing something she doesn't feel proud of, is a natural consequence. \n\nIt's also natural for a poor choice maker like her to want to be around others who make poor choices, and to avoid  good choice makers, like you. \n\nJust the sight of you likely makes her feel guilty. \n\nYou aren't judging Her, you're judging the behavior, and it isn't like your view of it as a poor choice is \"out there\", it's that it's appropriate- too appropriate for comfort.", "Soft YTA. VERY Soft. \n\nYou seem to sort of make it about you when it has nothing to do with you. Those are grown ass adults doing consensual things together. Honestly, if it rubs you the wrong way so much, maybe take a step back from this relationship. Just like I wouldn\u2019t hang out with someone who is rude to waitstaff, I also wouldn\u2019t hang out with a cheater/ homewrecker. It goes against my morals. Just like she\u2019s distanced herself, I\u2019d do the same. But because you feel you\u2019re really close, I\u2019d sit down one on one and have a conversation. You might say, \u201cI never thought of it that way\u201d or \u201cwe seem to be going on different paths so let\u2019s continue going our separate ways\u201d. It\u2019s hard to let go of a relationship; especially a long term relationship. \n\nCan you reconcile your beliefs to still hang with her?", "I would say that yes, the AH alarm is beeping. Her sexual decisions seem consensual with both parties. You look down your nose at her ethics. She is an adult and is gonna be into things that aren't right in your eyes. That's the thing with friends. They're not going to align with all of your expectations. They're gonna do things that they want to do. It looks to me like you feel the need to control her via the mothering tactic. Are you trying to save her? Well, that's not your job. That's her job. Only she can save herself. \n\nNow, this judgmental nature you have exhibited is not only affecting her relationship with you. You said that others in the group didn't wanna include you in the conversation either. There's others that don't want to talk to you about things too. When that happens, the direction you want to be looking at is in the mirror. \n\nAsk yourself how you'd feel if the roles were reversed. If you did activities that she didn't approve of, would you want her scolding you and telling you how disappointed she is? That latter one is a tactic abusers use to inflict guilt onto those they're speaking to. It's used to produce the abuser's desired results. \n\nAre you aware that friends aren't their friend's parents? It sounds like you are very disapproving of this thing she does. That's okay to disapprove. You don't have to like everything about your friends. But it is your responsibility to layout boundaries with her. You should've stated that you wanted zero involvement in these affairs of hers. If people aren't told, how would they know? \n\nNow, you've gotten so upset by her shenanigans that an emotional response took lead. (That's what it sounds like from what you described). There's a sore spot with that subject with her. So, you just want her to act better, in your eyes. That way you don't have to hear about the disdainfulness. That's okay to tell your friend that you'd prefer not to hear about it. Everybody has limitations. But using your approach that mimics what abusers do to their victims with the lecturing, your disappointment, your judgmentalness... who'd truly enjoy being talked to like that, really? \n\nI would remove the rose colored glasses and look in the mirror before continuing to judge her. Write it all down. Make a pros and cons list about her friendship. Journal your thoughts about others. After a month, review it. You may notice a level of chronic negativity bestowed on others regularly. If you notice that, make a pros list of those people. Keep writing everything down. Review things each month. You will notice patterns and meeting with a therapist or mentor may help you sort things out. That way, you're controlling yourself instead of the futile attempts to do it to others. \n\nShe may need time apart from you right now. It's apparent that she no longer trusts you enough to include you now. She doesn't want you judging her harshly. So...", "Oh man am I going to get downvotes for this but imo YTA.\n\nLaura is living her life the way she wants to live it. She is fully aware of what she did and why. \n\nShe felt like crap about it and confided in you because in her eyes your friendship together meant that she thought you were a safe space. But you weren't.\nShe didn't need your judgements. She needed your support.\nIt's completely possible to both disagree with her choices AND comfort her while she's feeling bad about herself.\nBy showing her that you weren't a safe space for her to share her secrets, she became more distant. Now she knows that she can't rely on you while she's down.\n\nYou say you love her and will be there for her, but I find that hard to believe. What you want is for her to be a version of herself that isn't her. You don't accept her for who she is. You're judgmental of her flaws. She saw this when you reacted the way you did and grew distant.\n\nWith John it's completely different. She hurt one of your friends. Laying down a boundary \"don't do that to my friends\" is perfectly reasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My friends tell me when I'm wrong and I tell them when they are. Its how we learn and grow and change together. If we stopped doing that, there would very quickly come a day (like it has with OP) where our actions/beliefs no longer align with each other and we'd leave because of some weird idea that we have to accept everything silently and completely.\n\nI love my friend entirely as he is, and i also pointed out his caffeine addiction and worked to help him get over it. Cuz thats real love and Real friendship. We'd still be friends if he never broke the addiction but id always want Better for him.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

One day that wife will find out and you can bet she would take that lying down, it is better to not be involved in case it blows up in their faces, which is likely going to happen. \n\nBest to say Bye Felicia and cut your losses with this so called friend. Think of this not your monkeys, not your circus.", "NTA but if you have spoken to them and they're encouraging you to talk to her then they are relying on you to be the bad guy. They want to be the fun friends by pretending that everything is ok and have you do the actual work. I'd say ditch them all.", "This is not friendship, if you have a partner they\u2019re not safe from your friend. I think you should end this so called friendship. She\u2019s not trustworthy", "NTA, but maybe ask your friends why haven\u2019t they spoken up? You don\u2019t call out friends but call them in. You did that by letting her know how you felt.

I'd take a moment to weigh in just how good people they are and how good friends they are being.", "How is your situation the same as what OP described about her friend?

We all change through our lives. My friends and I change with each other by sharing our views with one another and calling out ills.\n\nYou sound like you like really surface-level relationships with those around you, and thats fine for you, but thats not all friendship is and its especially not the making of long-lasting intimate relationships. \n\nGoodluck with....whatever you got going on tho.", "I\u2019m saying we don\u2019t have the information.

People evolve but seldom change. The difference is the speed at which it happens. I would wager you\u2019re still to young to really understand relationships.

We know what OP is telling us.\n\nOP was told directly by the friend. If that's what she told OP, I don't know why we need to make stories or excuses for that friend.\n\n\n\n>he admits she doesn\u2019t tell him everything\n\nAfter she felt judged (rightly so) for her shitty choices. And she's choosing not to tell OP any more about her shitty choices. That's not the same as what you are making it out to be.\n\n>When I was that age, I would\u2019ve rather been thought of as slutty than stupid. You can come back from slutty. Stupid is forever.\n\nThis is honestly such a weird take. I mean, you do you. You have your own experience, but I completely disagree with the last two sentences. No way do a vast majority of people choose slutty over stupid and think that stupid is forever. The easiest choice for the friend here would have been to say that she had no clue that former coworker has a wife. Then OP wouldn't have told her that her actions were disappointing.", "Telling someone they're wrong and want them to be better is not forcing anything on them. Matter of fact, the very first thing I said was \"I'll love you no matter what\", and I do love her, and because I love her I'll encourage her to be a better person, and I expect that my friends do the same thing for me. I'm not interested in being surrounded by people who celebrate my poor choices when I hurt someone, and I sure would not be that person for the people I love either."]}
