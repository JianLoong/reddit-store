Having a newborn is a lot of work! You are both exhausted. If she\u2019s freaking out about sleep, she needs a break! We have a 6mo at home and I usually do all of the night feedings (still 3-4 a night cuz screw me) but when I\u2019m exhausted my husband gets up and covers without complaining. It\u2019s really on a case by case basis and works for us. We both work full time but he works longer and more erratic shifts, so he needs more sleep. If she was asking you to get up, it\u2019s because she was at her wits end and needed some sleep. If you can spare it, try to trade off when she needs it. You are a team! Good luck and congratulations!", "NTA When I had my twins and my husband went back to work, I made sure that I was the one that took the night shifts so he could be well rested for work. It\u2019s not like taking care of a new born is that difficult at night, change/feed/burp then back to sleep. Why disturb husbands sleep unless there was a situation where I needed the hands. It sounds like you are an active parent and doing your part, while also financially providing. It also sounds like when she goes back to work you are willing to make the effort so that both of you are well rested. One baby needs one parent at night, no need for both to lose sleep. I feel like a lot of people commenting haven\u2019t been a parent. You and your wife will find your happy place, it just takes time and work. Be open, vulnerable and communicate. Maybe something else is going on with your wife that is deeper than the night help. Good luck!", "NTA-as a woman who had 3 pregnancies. A spouse that happens to not get up on nights before going into work is not automatically an AH. I was a SAHM for a portion and a FT out of the home worker for a portion. If you\u2019re working, you are ALSO contributing. Your work isn\u2019t just for you-it\u2019s for your whole family. As long as you have accurately described the situation, you are doing your share. Equal contribution to a household doesn\u2019t mean you have to count and equally split diaper changes or how many nights you get up. What next? Are you going to count and equally split how many garments are in the loads of laundry you each do? \n\nEqual contribution means you are both working together for the benefit of your family. Night duty and work are both contributing activities. I would rather you get a decent night\u2019s sleep, so you don\u2019t fall asleep at the wheel!\n\nEDIT: I have now gone through and read your comments/additional info, OP. Personally, I now think you\u2019re doing about 60/40 or 65/35 of the household chores/responsibilities. Since you\u2019re already splitting the nights, there is definitely no way for you to be the AH here. I agree with the other commenter that suggested you and your wife need to explore where else this reaction may be coming from. Maybe she\u2019s having physical/mental challenges in recovery? Explore further.", "I\u2019m actually going to say NAH, because I\u2019ve been in this situation and it sucks for all involved, but then you\u2019re not allowed to say that because you had a baby and it\u2019s your fault \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\n\nHave you two sat down at a time when you\u2019re both calm (and it\u2019s not nighttime) to discuss some solutions that would work for you both? I\u2019m making a huge assumption here, but I wonder whether your wife has actually had the opportunity to process the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d model (where you get up on the nights you\u2019re not in the office so she can sleep, and she gets up the remaining nights).\n\nMy brain was like vegetable soup for the first 9 months of my son\u2019s life (then we sleep trained \ud83d\ude2c), and I can 100% see myself getting into this situation.", "NTA I was prepared to roast you based on the title, but reading the details, it\u2019s only three nights out of seven that you are asking to sleep through, and those are long days with a commute. If you are truly doing are the nighttime stuff on the other four days, I think that\u2019s really fair, as your wife and gets to sleep through those nights.", "Nta. This thread is a ton of people who made up their mind before reading it.", "I think I need more INFO. If you work 2 days from home, and help out on weekends, that's already about 50-50 for getting up in the middle of the night, and that seems fair to me. If you are only helping 2 nights out of 7, that's a lot of stress on her.\n\nThink of it this way. I know her mother helps out, but she basically has a full-time job right now too, taking care of the baby. So you saying you have a full-time job is not necessarily a legitimate reason to do less than half the work.", "NTA, this is a hot button topic and people judge without even reading thoroughly. If you are speaking truth I see that you are taking night changes/feeds 4 out of 7 nights in addition to evening child care and some meal prep. That sounds like an active involved father. Asking to sleep on the three mornings you have an early commute is definitely reasonable.", "Going against the grain NTA.\n\nDuring my maternity leave my husband slept in a different room so he could get a good night sleep to work the next day.\n\nI slept during the day when the baby did.  It honestly wasn\u2019t that complicated.", "Hire a night nurse. \n\nYour wife felt so strongly that she yelled at you and slammed the door. Listen to her! She's obviously not getting enough sleep, and her body will take a very long time to fully heal from making a new human being, and then bringing that human being into the world. \n\nYou also have to sleep, and get up for work. You have the means to hire some help at night  - that's exactly what I'd do.", "So let's say baby goes down at 9. Wife winds down and falls a sleep at 10. You crawl in bed at 10:30. 3 hours later your wife is up with the baby. Change, feed. Get back to sleep. It's now 1:45 am. Your wife crawls in bed and her brain is still going, so she has to wind down. Finally gets back to sleep at 2:15. Fuck ,now it's 4 (1 hour 44 mins). Wife gets up. change, feed. Back to sleep. She crawls in to bed at 5. Just as she's drifting off, your alarm goes off. Wakes her up. She tries to sleep. But you are making noise. Not loud or obnoxious, just noise. You leave for work. She finally falls a sleep . Then the baby wakes up .she has to start the day.b", "I'm going to say NAH since I was that tired momma (still am lol). Does it suck being the main one to wake up in the middle of the night? Yes it does, but like your wife, I stay home all day with my babies and I got to spend more time with them and see a lot of their first that their dad missed. Like you, he would help on the weekends and whenever he got off from work, he would make sure to take over for a bit to give me a break. \n\nI think your wife is just tired and experiencing what every parent does at some point. Nothing prepares you for being woken up by a crying baby.", "NTA you share nights. You are asking that she takes 3 nights and you take 4. So long as you take the entire night she gets 4 full nights of sleep so NTA", "NTA \n\nAt this age babies generally sleep a lot. The parent that is home during the day and can nap when the baby naps should be the one getting up at night. If you're both working outside the home it's different. \n \nScreaming at you to wake up and help is a little ridiculous imo. Maybe there are other things going on to make her feel resentful?", "I would say NTA even though that might be seen as whatever people go over board with the while SAHP is the \"hardest job\" (I thought that was teachers though, it's all theater and virtue signaling but I digress). Who cooks cleans does laundry yard work etc? That factors in too.", "NTA based of what I feel is a similar situation. I have a 6 month old baby and I am still on maternity leave. While I'm on maternity leave I am taking primary carer duties, I'm at home during the day and able to nap when my baby naps if I feel tired. I am also doing most of the chores around the house. In my opinion this seems fair and I do it willingly, my husband works very hard and needs sleep to safely do his job.", "NTA! You\u2019re getting up on the days you\u2019re not working. You helps out during your paternity leave. You will share duty once everyone is back to work. The fact she has help daily to assist with the baby the only one who is selfish is her right now. She can easily nap when baby is or when mom is there to help out. The fact people said she needs brakes clearly don\u2019t realize what you\u2019ve said and are helping. I don\u2019t know what planet they\u2019re on. Unless she was not getting help and the baby didn\u2019t nap maybe I can see it, but you\u2019re doing your share when you can.I had two babies and when I was on leave it was for me and I\u2019d never expect my husband to get up when I have the ability to sleep when the baby does. Never mind if I had a mom to watch while I\u2019ll nap. As long as you picked up the slack on weekends and days when you can I\u2019m all for it.", "NTA. Yes, she\u2019s tired.  But she can nap during the day and you cannot.  And you need to be able to drive safely on your commutes and if you are overly tired, that\u2019s a danger to you and everyone else on the road.  \n\nYou are not saying you will do no wake ups.  You are asking for the ability to sleep on the few days a week that your safety depends on sleep.  It\u2019s unreasonable for you to essentially do all of the wake ups while she\u2019s on maternity leave.  If you guys are going to split them when she\u2019s back to work full time in three months but not now, it honestly seems like you will get more sleep when she\u2019s back to work.  How does that make sense?", "NTA. This is completely reasonable to me and my husband. That\u2019s how we\u2019re rolling. My husband has always helps around the house, helps cooked meals, does his own laundry. I don\u2019t consider him selfish for needing a good nights sleep before going into work. I work, I know how it is. I feel it\u2019s doing my part to take on baby during nights and while he\u2019s at work. I have no doubt he\u2019ll contribute to nights when I\u2019m back to work or if I were sick and needed my rest more than him for a night or two.", "NTA - if you're waking at 5:45am to drive to work, you need to be alert enough to drive safely on those days.\nCould there be some kind of general compromise though? Instead of one parent doing every night wake, could you take alternate ones so that you both get longer sleep times? Eg, you do bedtime feed and midnight, she does 10pm and 2am. However your feed times fall. And maybe if baby tends to wake before you leave for work, you could do that one. But if your wife thinks you should do all night feeds just because she has baby all day, that's unreasonable.", "Nta.\n\nShe doesn't realise how lucky she is. If you're doing the night feeds when you wfh two nights plus the two weekend nights, you are doing the majority!\n\nPersonally, I think that if you need to do an overnight feed, that you should be doing the earlier feed in the hope of getting a block of sleep for work.\n\nHer expectations are unreasonable.", "NTA.  Your working full time and almost split it around 50/50 anyway with the weekend plus 2 days from work. NTA!", "NTA. Being a stay-at-home mom is a full time job. But when dad gets home, it\u2019s the baby responsibilities don\u2019t shift 100% to him. They become 50-50. Dad is willing to get up 4/7 nights, Mom should be able to do the other three. If you\u2019re both incapable of sharing that workload, you need to hire help. Otherwise, this should be able to be solved by making a schedule.", "NTA.... it's doesn't makes sense for you to split 50/50 while you need to work and she stays home... while she doesn't work she needs to take more house/baby responsibilities..\nWhen she's back to work go 50/50", "NTA - isn\u2019t this what maternity leave is for? She doesn\u2019t have to work and her mom is able to help during the day so she could nap if she wanted too. You guys need to sit down and discuss time management.", "NTA. I\u2019m currently a sahd and never wake my wife up when she has to work the next day. She should be sleeping when the baby sleeps.", "YTA She needs breaks! She needs more than an hour or so uninterrupted sleep. Being a sahp is the hardest job in the world because it's actually many, many jobs and you never get time off. Ever. Her brain and body need time to recharge just like yours. She IS working full time, same as you. Step up and take your turns.", "YTA. Your wife IS working full time just like you do. And one nap on a day her mom takes the baby is a drop in an ocean of exhaustion. Being an at-home parent during mat leave is 800% more work than your day job no matter how stressful it is or senior you are. You are treating her hours upon hours of feeding and pumping and changing and bathing and soothing and caring as \"not work\". STOP IT. When you get home from your non-screaming, non-pooping job, I will bet money she is an absolutely destroyed level of tired at 5 pm. She is as tired as you are at night from working all day. YTA. Get up at night and be a parent. With any luck, your daughter will be sleeping through the night soon. If that isn't happening and you need help, pay for a sleep consultant. My brother says it's the best money he ever spent.", "YTA and it's really rude to act like your wife \"doesn't work\" just because her work is caring for your child.", "I\u2019m not gonna go as far as saying YTA. But it takes two to make a baby. You can\u2019t expect her to be the one to get up and take care of the baby. Especially since she\u2019s home everyday with the baby. The least you can do is help in the middle of the night.\n\nEdit: OP is TA.", "YTA. Your wife is working a full time job, it\u2019s called taking care of a 3 month old.\n\nIf you are unable to help at night, then you need to hire a night nurse to help your wife. Or a daytime nanny so your wife can get some sleep.", "YTA. Would you ask one of your employees to be on call for 24 hours straight? You need to step up.", "[deleted]", "YTA - she's still getting paid, just like you. There is nothing you're doing at work that is more important than what she does at home, which apparently means being on call 24/7 for a baby and a man. Why is she cleaning anything if you're not getting up? God. She's TIRED.", "YTA. Get up and help.", "YTA\n\nI didn't need to read your entire post to make my judgement.\n\nLast time I checked, BOTH parents need to get up in the night to care of their baby, not just one person who does it all the time.\n\nMy mom (for a bit) didn't work full time, and yet my dad still got up in the middle of the night to care for us.", "YTA. This is your child too, it's time to step up and take responsibility", "YTA\n\nI get that your MIL is coming and giving your wife some help. But she still just gave birth 3 months ago. Her body is still recovering even if it doesn't seem like it. She sounds like she is overwhelmed (that doesn't mean its logical- but it's still real) and she is asking you for your help.\n\nIf your MIL comes for a bit and she spends the 5 hours doing chores she feels pressure to do so. If you're saying \"oh I wouldn't judge ...\" sorry bro kinda sounds like you are. \n\nIt sounds like you're kinda being stubborn about this, which is probably why she's freaking out. She's desperate her whole world is changed- and not that yours isn't too- but you get to go to an office a few days a week. For 8 plus hours a few days a week- you're still the same person you were pre-baby. _You even are getting a full night's rest with an infant._\n\nYour wife needs some support. Maternity leave isn't so the mom can take care of a baby by herself. It's so she can care for her baby AND _herself_. \n\nAs someone with a high-stress job- I get where you are coming from. The days I don't sleep definitely makes work a hell of a lot less pleasant. I think everyone empathizes with you there. Being a parent is a sacrifice. Your wife sacrificed her _body_.

Maybe if you take baby when you get home from work you can encourage your wife to go to bed early or even just have a nap for an hour before getting on with the day.

I figure that I will be waking up anyway and I want one of us to be sleeping. But I also will expect him to carry the load of parenting in other ways; for example, driving and other things that I can\u2019t do with sleep deprivation.

The arrangement you want is fair and reasonable.", "I was the SAHP for our kids. My partner worked full time and is also a heavy sleeper. I know Reddit hates that, but they were a heavy sleeper when I met them and they still are. It is what it is. With all three kids I was the one did all of the nighttime feedings and diapers during the week. Weekends we aimed to split it and we def did during the early newborn stage, but I still did most nighttime stuff. If something really went sideways like the baby was hungry and the toddler was puking, I could wake my partner no matter what night it was and they\u2019d help deal with everything (usually they got the puking toddler). The trade off for me doing all the night stuff was that on weekends my partner got up with the kids and I got to sleep in. During the week I tried to nap with the baby. That got harder once there were three of them, but we made it work. You don\u2019t sound like someone complaining about housework etc, so NTA. \n\nThat being said, you should try to get to the root of what\u2019s going on. Maybe MIL can babysit so you two can have an uninterrupted chat. Things don\u2019t sound great if your wife is screaming at you. Maybe suggest a housekeeper so she feels better about napping instead of doing chores? Does she like having her mom there? Sometimes that\u2019s helpful and sometimes it\u2019s not.

So figure out what your schedule needs to look like so you can both get 6 hours uninterrupted.", "NTA.\n\nFor the reasons others have posted.\n\nThe one thing I wanted to add, at least for my wife and I, it's not a static split.  When I get tired and want more rest time, she picks up the slack for a bit.  When she is tired, I will do more.

It\u2019s such a strong need/desire for some ppl even if they never say a word\u2026. and then comes the guilt for feeling this way when you are the mother.\n4) some ppl on low quality night sleep are really thrown out of balance. Add to that the hormones and you have yourself a rather explosive cocktail .\n\nHer paid maternity leave + your 6 weeks off make me think EU country. Not sure if it\u2019s everywhere already but in many EU countries fathers are also entitled to reduced hours, like a day off (Papadag) per week (yes, you also lose part of your income with it but in many cases the government reimburses a portion). Think whether that solution would be worth it for you two coz you don\u2019t have to lose those precious months and she can have a day where she can be herself.\n\nFirst year with a baby is not easy but if you work together you can come out on the other side without losses and resentment.

You mentioned she has help from her mum for a few hours, from my experience having to ask for help as a new mum is embarrassing and you feel like a failure as a mum due to not being able to be the perfect mum to baby and this can lead to postpartum depression. \n\nWe got told that when baby sleeps, we should sleep, but it isn't that easy.

He\u2019s never been the one who gets up at night cause our kids were/are both breastfed (yes, he could have done bottles with our first, but I was waking up to his cries anyways and I\u2019ve always had a harder time falling asleep so there wasn\u2019t any point to him getting up when I was already awake). Yes, he wakes up some nights, so he\u2019s not getting uninterrupted sleep every night, but he rolls right over when I say it\u2019s fine and falls asleep within seconds. He also naps a lot.

And in the first 3 months I was fully responsible for the nights because my spouse said he needed sleep and was unbearable when I asked him this one night to do it. My baby was up all night and didn\u2019t sleep well.

Luckily your wife sleeps better, but if she has a hard time recovering then that might be a big problem as well. \n\nYes your wife has paid maternity leave but the broken nights might even be harder on her body because she is still recovering. Slee deprivation is already hard for you but her body is actually still recovering from child birth.

My husband had a job which was normal hours, so less stress than OP's, but after the first few weeks, I acknowledged I was not coping with the broken sleep and was on the verge of an emotional breakdown. We made a deal that if it was feeding related screaming (IE it was time for a feed and son was crying), I would get up as it was pointless both of us getting up since I had to be up anyway. If my son was waking for any other reason, I would wake my husband and he would get up and just got to work tired. Admittedly, I didn't have my mother helping out after the first couple of weeks, so I can certainly get where OP is coming from. She can take a nap then. OP can't. Hopefully the two of them can come to a compromise that can work for them both. Maybe on days when OP's workload is not so heavy the next day, OP could take 1 night time shift.", "Yup!  I agree.

But, it's hard when i couldn't get much sleep where previously my sleep hygiene entailed a good 7-8 hrs undisturbed sleep. And then i had to deal with the same person who broke my sleep throughout the day. It was rough.\n\nHaving said that, with these arrangement, your wife is having her sleep broken for at least twice if your baby follow normal sleep routine. That's not good sleep hygiene as this could mean having only 2-3 hours of sleep each depending on quickly a person can go back to sleep and being woken up again. \n\nYour claim that she can take nap while your baby with her mom might sound sensible. But a nap is not equal to long unbroken sleep where a proper sleep cycle can be achieve multiple times. Your wife might not be person that can take a nap easily. I certainly don't or can't make myself.   \n\n\nPlus, as you also said she used this \"free\" time as doing household chores. Seems to me that she is working full time like you do.

But ultimately, the newborn stage is a WILD ride, postpartum hormones are all over the place, and sleep deprivation affecting both of you. \n\nUltimately I think you both could use a blame-free conversation and talk about expectations and your respective experiences, because it may be hard to fully empathize with the other. \n\nFor perspective, I have a 4 month old and recently returned to work. I had 12 weeks maternity leave and my husband split up his paternity leave - 2 weeks after birth, 2 weeks half way through which coincided with the holidays, and 2 weeks after I returned to work. When we were both home we tag teamed all the wake ups. When he went back to work he would have woken up with me but I opted to let him sleep (it was my decision and he supported that I could decide). He would have gotten up with me if I ever needed it. I think that helped, knowing I could wake him up but that I was able to make the decision to let him sleep, not being told. \n\nWhen I returned to work the plan was for me to wake to feed (breastfeeding) but my husband could do diaper changes and resettle to sleep. Sometimes resettling to sleep is easy and baby falls asleep nursing and sometimes it can take longer. But ultimately I chose to still do a lot of the resettling. For me, being away all day made me cherish those moments more and I wanted all the time I could get in the middle of the night. I also never would have said this when my husband was working and I was home all day, but when I returned to work I told him all the time that he had the harder job being home all day and I had it easy going to work. And I think that\u2019s an important perspective. \n\nI\u2019d caution against comparing working now to working before the baby (which is the easy thing to compare!). Before you could get a good nights sleep easily and go to work rested. You could come home from work and unwind however you wanted, relaxing alone, with your spouse, going out with friends, etc. You both work full time, you at the office in a high stress environment and her at home taking care of the baby, also can be a high stress environment. \n\nI can\u2019t comment on her having her mom come over and help during the day since I didn\u2019t have that experience.

Your wife is on duty 24/7.\n\nYou mention she could have napped when her mom helped for 5 hours. You also said she did chores. Please consider why your wife spent all five hours working instead of napping. Are you grocery shopping? Scrubbing toilets? Doing dishes? Vacuuming? Doing laundry? It sounds great to say sleep when the baby does or when you have help. But the reality is that things need done in the household. If you aren\u2019t doing them, she has to. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s wrong if she is doing them, but you need to consider 5 hours quickly disappears when you have chores. She may also feel guilty having someone else give their time up to help while she\u2019s \u201clazy\u201d and sleeping. Don\u2019t underestimate the pressure put on women and mothers to do it all.

What works at three months may not work at 4 months when there\u2019s a sleep regression. What works at 6 months may not work at 7 months when three teeth come in at once. Yes, you may be more tired. You may need to get up during the night sometimes even if you go to work the next day. Even if your wife stays home. Never underestimate how much easier it is to be the one laying in bed, even if the crying wakes you, than it is to be the person on their feet figuring out what the baby needs and meeting all those needs. \n\nSleep deprivation is legit a form of torture. While one or both of you is going through that, you need to be extra kind to each other. And sometimes you may need to give your wife a break at night because mental health matters.

It doesn\u2019t have to be I did X last time, you must do X this time.", ">It\u2019s not like taking care of a new born is that difficult at night, change/feed/burp then back to sleep. \n\nI think this is where lot of people disagree. Most babies are relatively easy in the first weeks, but around 2-3 months, when cramps and colic and all that stuff are going wild, this can change in a major way. For instance, with both my children I had maternity leave for 3 months and was exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months, so every nightfeed was on me. But the oldest had bad cramping at the end of the night, and often would wake every 10-15 minutes after 4.30 AM. I would have easy nights, with two feeds and back to sleap in no time, but also nights with 2-3 hours of sleep total. Those nights I made it a habit to handle everything until 5, after that i woke my husband (whose alarm was 7 am) and told him he would be taking over. He happily did that because he knew I was only doing that when I didnt have it in me to continue.\n\nAlso: is the baby sleeping well during the day? With my oldest I found it very hard to be home alone with her and take care of her, as she slept only 30 minutes a time. I cried sometimes feeling overwhelmed with everything and especially not knowing how to help my daugther sleep better. She's 3,5 now, and our youngest is 1,5, and they sleep through the night 95% of the time and communicate and stuff, but a day home alone with the kids is still twice as exhausting as a day at work is for me.", ">Maybe something else is going on with your wife that is deeper than the night help.\n\nLike maybe she is not getting enough sleep?! Oh, and before you judge I *am* a parent, so are many others that thinks OP should also help on night duties even of he works full time. This whole assumption that *he* works full time and she doesn't needs to stop. She is also working full time, she's just lucky that she doesn't have her second, paying job that she'll also be working full time for at the moment. They need to work ot out together but his sleep isn't more important than hers, which is why splitting the night duties is important. Raising kids is hard *for both parents*.", "Dear lord I don't think you realise how easy you had it if that's how easy you nights were with new borns. I have 4 kids and not one of the nights went how you described.", "Sleeping when the baby sleeps does not always work. When my kid was that age he only slept for 20 minutes at a time unless being held. \n\nParents cannot safely sleep while holding the baby, and also can\u2019t get any quality restorative sleep in less than 20 minutes. So idk when/how she is supposed to nap during the day in my scenario unless they both decide that putting the babies safety at risk is ok", "Oh my god nap when the baby naps is such a crock of shit. My baby will nap when she\u2019s on me and only when she\u2019s on me. She\u2019s 5 months old and so far I have never been able to nap during the day when she does, not once. So actually I just haven\u2019t slept for more than 4 hours since she was born. You might\u2019ve had a baby where you could do that but all the parents I know are in the same boat as me. I could cry when people say this, it\u2019s so unfair. I haven\u2019t had a break in weeks, staying home with a baby is not fucking easy. It\u2019s much harder than my 50 hour a week job ever was. At least then I got a lunch break \ud83d\ude2d", "It sounds like he\u2019s doing *more* than half. He\u2019s responsible for nearly half of nights and he doesn\u2019t have the ability to nap at his job like a SAHP does when their baby sleeps. I understand that naps aren\u2019t the same as a full night\u2019s rest, but the option to nap doesn\u2019t exist for OP while it does for his wife 7/7 days of the week.", "No, he\u2019s not asking for 24/7. He said that days he works at home and weekends he\u2019s happy to take the nights.", "He does 4 nights a week, she does 3\u2026.", "OP is a mother. She gave birth to their first child, who died.", "OP is a mother. She gave birth to their first child, who died.", "This is a good point, possibly the wife is dealing with some medical issues.", "Yeah dude - NTA. You're both doing the best you can. I'm sure your wife is going through it right now - sometimes even when you're in the right (and you are!), talking about it can really help in case there is something else which is bothering her. \n\nFriends of mine who have had the means to hire a night nurse have commented that it was the best money they ever spent. If that is possible for you, it may make a world of difference.", "I'm a stay at home Dad (I do some animation work on a commission basis but my wife is the breadwinner).   \n\n\nWhen we were both on leave after our son was born, we full on alternated sleep schedules. Like, I was up till 4am while she slept, and then I'd go to sleep and she'd get up with him so I could sleep. That way we both got 7-8 hours of sleep even if it meant the rest of our day basically ceased to exist.  \n\n\nWhen she went back to work, he became 100% mine 6 days of the week. Kiddo wakes up at 2am? I'm getting up. Wakes up for the 5th time in a night? I'm getting up.  \n\n\nThere's only two exceptions: She has Sat/Sunday off. Saturday she gets to sleep in, Sunday I get to sleep in. So Friday night she'll stay up hanging out with online friends, and Saturday I do the same. Which means Saturday night if the kiddo wakes up, she'll get up with him.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you already get up with him on your off nights, are are willing to get up with him on the days you WFH (which is already more than you should be needing to do IMO).  \n\n\nAbsolutely NTA.   \n\n\nThat said, talk to her. Sit her down and ask her if there is anything else bothering her and that if there is you don't want her to bottle it up. You want to both be able to sit and talk without any yelling and try to work things out.  \n\n\nThe reality is the solution might be \"nothing changes, she just has to accept it.\"", "First, this is a temporary situation- your baby will start sleeping longer soon!!  However, I've been through this with two kids.  What worked for us is that, hubby would stay up and feed the baby for the first feed and I would go to bed early.  Then I'd wake up and feed the baby around 4am and he would sleep through that.  That way everyone gets at least 6-7 hours of uninterrupted sleep, depending on the feeding interval.  We both worked during this whole time and it was manageable. Good luck and lot's of love to you and your new family!", "She might just cope really badly with being solely responsible for a small human in the middle of the night when she's exhausted. She's probably jealous that you get to leave and go to work; just because you wanted longer doesn't mean she did. Talk to her! You guys will get through this.\n\nETA: she's probably struggling with self worth as a temporary SAHM while you leave for work, and desperately needs you to acknowledge that she's still doing something equally valuable such that she deserves sleep as much as you do. As someone in school while my husband works, it feels SO bad to always be the one doing something less important that can take second stage, even though obviously we need money to live on. The middle of the night when you're the one who has to wake up to do something is when it cuts most.", "My dad did this with us and just never really stopped, he still goes to bed at about 8 now!! And his youngest child is now 22!!", "She can rest during the day. He can\u2019t. Not to mention, he helps out on days he doesn\u2019t work.", "That makes it worse since OP has zero empathy.", "Hm, I didn\u2019t see that so I understand your point. I hate hate hate the \u201cbut I work\u201d line that is so popular and may have been a little quick to judge. However, wife seems to be really struggling and arguing that point doesn\u2019t address the problem.", "My mistake, didn\u2019t realize.", "What\u2019s there to discuss? He\u2019s working she is not. Any rational person wouldn\u2019t need childcare expectations spelled out in that scenario.", "She gets to sleep on the job and he has a boss. It's not nearly the same. She has no accountability and a bad attitude. If she pulled that crap at work she'd be fired. The wife is lazy and selfish.", "I think you need to read again, OP is a man.", "Thank you for mentioning PPD as I know how serious this is. I am so sorry you struggled with this, and glad you had an active support system to help. I truly want to be that for my wife, and hopefully when we sit down and discuss all of this she will be open about any PPD-related symptoms. From other comments and suggestions made, I agree something bigger may be at play that I\u2019m desperate to figure out and help with. There are so many granularities and nuances of the situation that did not go into the initial post (as all complex situations typically are) but overall I feel I\u2019ve received a lot of beneficial feedback and even some tough yet truthful opinions that have made me readjust from a place of grace and understanding. Admittedly, something I was missing when writing the initial post and I take full accountability for that. Another comment suggested I was being reactive and assuaging guilt, but it is more so filling in the gaps where I neglected to mentions every detail of the situation. \n\nOn a pleasant note - I am happy to report my daughter is a very happy baby who sleeps wonderfully throughout the day (lots of long naps) and is truly a joy in our lives.", "She\u2019s getting more rest than he is as he\u2019s only asking for 3 nights of uninterrupted sleep while she gets 4.", "My husband is an active parent and wonderful. Before I went back to work with our second, I did all of the overnights but Friday night. However, he takes our kids on drives after work to settle them. He took over a ton of responsibility with our older one while I was recovering. The baby is not an easy sleeper and he has taken over the 5 am feed on work nights several times. He tells me I'm doing great and that I'm beautiful. Didn't stop me from having a crazy breakdown at six weeks and yelling at him one night in tears. It was ALL hormones combined with exhaustion. I apologized. He understood. Post partum is hard as hell, and OP seems really open to communication. They will find their groove and the baby will start sleeping better. Yes, they need to have a talk, but I don't think this guy needs a lecture from the internet.", "Oh come on at least attempt to read the extremely thorough explaination of the question you are about to post before you hit submit, that\u2019s very cringe if you.", "She is working\n She is keeping their baby alive. It's a 24/7 job that doesn't pay", "Getting to sleep on the job for small windows during a 24hr shift is called being \u201con call\u201d \ud83e\udd23 and that baby is calling the shots", "No, she is post partum. It's hard as hell and exhausting. He isn't wrong. She should be doing most of the overnights. He actually does more overnight care than I had my husband do, but they need to find what works for them together. I think what she is asking is unreasonable, but this is a time in a woman's life where she is not always totally reasonable. NAH. They need to talk, but the solution to this issue is really just time.", "Th OP is a woman and mother who birthed their first child and unfortunately lost that child.", "You seem like a good egg. I hope you and your wife can come to a place of understanding and have a game plan together moving forward.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I also think it\u2019s telling that people are heteronormatively assuming you must be a man and letting that inform their judgments. I do wonder what the response would be like if your post made it clear you have experienced childbirth and all the complexities that come with it so people don\u2019t assume you\u2019re operating from a position of privilege or cluelessness.", "Look at the comment I'm replying to. Where they said no baby cries that much and if they do they need a doctor.\n\nThose statements are false", "If simple fixes like that worked, they didn't have colic. They had a sensitivity to the formulas", "All I said was my baby screamed and cried. \ud83e\udd23 9 years ago\u2026.there are drops but they aren\u2019t guaranteed. I breast fed. And tried formula. I changed my diet. And tried another formula. I changed bottles and tried another formula. I changed to another bottle\u2026getting the drift? \n\nSometimes, colic just runs it\u2019s course. And sometimes, babies just cry for hours no matter what you do.", "She\u2019s recovering from pregnancy. OP is not.", "This. I had my kid during peak Covid so getting out of the house wasn\u2019t really an option either. It was soooo lonely and sooooo boring. Not PPD but just having no one around to talk to was the hardest part for me.", "It\u2019s actually interesting to see this point of view and see how gender inherently causes bias. I feel bad for dads who are demonized outright for this issue, if no one cares to read the facts of the situation.

Getting the drift? \n\nSometimes, we just need to do a little research and find the right Dr.", "It was all under the care of a doctor. And then I changed to another doctor\u2026he is still under her care. Again, I tried the formula. Did you miss that? I tried the drops, did you miss that? \n\nAlso, it isn\u2019t CURABLE. It goes away. You can do things to soothe them but it does not always work. \n\nStop trying to shame me for having a colicky baby. \n\nOh look\u2026 All of the things I tried: \n\n\u201cIf your baby is bottle-fed and these methods don\u2019t work, your child\u2019s healthcare provider may recommend a 1-week trial of a non-milk-based formula.\n\nIf you breastfeed your baby, the provider may suggest that you avoid foods that are likely to cause an allergic reaction. This means that you should not have milk, eggs, nuts, or wheat for a period of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedication for colic:\n\nIt is not clear how useful medicines for colic are. Colic gets better by itself, often quite suddenly, whether you use any medicines or not. Medications can also make babies more sleepy, which can be dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cChanging the diet of a baby is only of proven benefit for colic if the baby has lactose intolerance or cow\u2019s milk allergies. Removing the substances from both the baby\u2019s and the mother\u2019s diet may be helpful. This should only be done with help from a doctor, to ensure the nutritional needs of both mother and baby are met.\u201d\n\nI did everything to the best of my ability under the care of a doctor. With my sister who had 3 children by then. Please, don\u2019t shame a mother for having a colicky baby. I\u2019m glad that yours went away so fast but it is not the norm."]}
