Having a newborn is a lot of work! You are both exhausted. If she\u2019s freaking out about sleep, she needs a break! We have a 6mo at home and I usually do all of the night feedings (still 3-4 a night cuz screw me) but when I\u2019m exhausted my husband gets up and covers without complaining. It\u2019s really on a case by case basis and works for us. We both work full time but he works longer and more erratic shifts, so he needs more sleep. If she was asking you to get up, it\u2019s because she was at her wits end and needed some sleep. If you can spare it, try to trade off when she needs it. You are a team! Good luck and congratulations!", "NTA When I had my twins and my husband went back to work, I made sure that I was the one that took the night shifts so he could be well rested for work. It\u2019s not like taking care of a new born is that difficult at night, change/feed/burp then back to sleep. Why disturb husbands sleep unless there was a situation where I needed the hands. It sounds like you are an active parent and doing your part, while also financially providing. It also sounds like when she goes back to work you are willing to make the effort so that both of you are well rested. One baby needs one parent at night, no need for both to lose sleep. I feel like a lot of people commenting haven\u2019t been a parent. You and your wife will find your happy place, it just takes time and work. Be open, vulnerable and communicate. Maybe something else is going on with your wife that is deeper than the night help. Good luck!", "NTA-as a woman who had 3 pregnancies. A spouse that happens to not get up on nights before going into work is not automatically an AH. I was a SAHM for a portion and a FT out of the home worker for a portion. If you\u2019re working, you are ALSO contributing. Your work isn\u2019t just for you-it\u2019s for your whole family. As long as you have accurately described the situation, you are doing your share. Equal contribution to a household doesn\u2019t mean you have to count and equally split diaper changes or how many nights you get up. What next? Are you going to count and equally split how many garments are in the loads of laundry you each do? \n\nEqual contribution means you are both working together for the benefit of your family. Night duty and work are both contributing activities. I would rather you get a decent night\u2019s sleep, so you don\u2019t fall asleep at the wheel!\n\nEDIT: I have now gone through and read your comments/additional info, OP. Personally, I now think you\u2019re doing about 60/40 or 65/35 of the household chores/responsibilities. Since you\u2019re already splitting the nights, there is definitely no way for you to be the AH here. I agree with the other commenter that suggested you and your wife need to explore where else this reaction may be coming from. Maybe she\u2019s having physical/mental challenges in recovery? Explore further.", "I\u2019m actually going to say NAH, because I\u2019ve been in this situation and it sucks for all involved, but then you\u2019re not allowed to say that because you had a baby and it\u2019s your fault \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\n\nHave you two sat down at a time when you\u2019re both calm (and it\u2019s not nighttime) to discuss some solutions that would work for you both? I\u2019m making a huge assumption here, but I wonder whether your wife has actually had the opportunity to process the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d model (where you get up on the nights you\u2019re not in the office so she can sleep, and she gets up the remaining nights).\n\nMy brain was like vegetable soup for the first 9 months of my son\u2019s life (then we sleep trained \ud83d\ude2c), and I can 100% see myself getting into this situation.", "NTA I was prepared to roast you based on the title, but reading the details, it\u2019s only three nights out of seven that you are asking to sleep through, and those are long days with a commute. If you are truly doing are the nighttime stuff on the other four days, I think that\u2019s really fair, as your wife and gets to sleep through those nights.", "Nta. This thread is a ton of people who made up their mind before reading it.", "I think I need more INFO. If you work 2 days from home, and help out on weekends, that's already about 50-50 for getting up in the middle of the night, and that seems fair to me. If you are only helping 2 nights out of 7, that's a lot of stress on her.\n\nThink of it this way. I know her mother helps out, but she basically has a full-time job right now too, taking care of the baby. So you saying you have a full-time job is not necessarily a legitimate reason to do less than half the work.", "NTA, this is a hot button topic and people judge without even reading thoroughly. If you are speaking truth I see that you are taking night changes/feeds 4 out of 7 nights in addition to evening child care and some meal prep. That sounds like an active involved father. Asking to sleep on the three mornings you have an early commute is definitely reasonable.", "Going against the grain NTA.\n\nDuring my maternity leave my husband slept in a different room so he could get a good night sleep to work the next day.\n\nI slept during the day when the baby did.  It honestly wasn\u2019t that complicated.", "Hire a night nurse. \n\nYour wife felt so strongly that she yelled at you and slammed the door. Listen to her! She's obviously not getting enough sleep, and her body will take a very long time to fully heal from making a new human being, and then bringing that human being into the world. \n\nYou also have to sleep, and get up for work. You have the means to hire some help at night  - that's exactly what I'd do.", "So let's say baby goes down at 9. Wife winds down and falls a sleep at 10. You crawl in bed at 10:30. 3 hours later your wife is up with the baby. Change, feed. Get back to sleep. It's now 1:45 am. Your wife crawls in bed and her brain is still going, so she has to wind down. Finally gets back to sleep at 2:15. Fuck ,now it's 4 (1 hour 44 mins). Wife gets up. change, feed. Back to sleep. She crawls in to bed at 5. Just as she's drifting off, your alarm goes off. Wakes her up. She tries to sleep. But you are making noise. Not loud or obnoxious, just noise. You leave for work. She finally falls a sleep . Then the baby wakes up .she has to start the day.b", "I'm going to say NAH since I was that tired momma (still am lol). Does it suck being the main one to wake up in the middle of the night? Yes it does, but like your wife, I stay home all day with my babies and I got to spend more time with them and see a lot of their first that their dad missed. Like you, he would help on the weekends and whenever he got off from work, he would make sure to take over for a bit to give me a break. \n\nI think your wife is just tired and experiencing what every parent does at some point. Nothing prepares you for being woken up by a crying baby.", "NTA you share nights. You are asking that she takes 3 nights and you take 4. So long as you take the entire night she gets 4 full nights of sleep so NTA", "NTA \n\nAt this age babies generally sleep a lot. The parent that is home during the day and can nap when the baby naps should be the one getting up at night. If you're both working outside the home it's different. \n \nScreaming at you to wake up and help is a little ridiculous imo. Maybe there are other things going on to make her feel resentful?", "I would say NTA even though that might be seen as whatever people go over board with the while SAHP is the \"hardest job\" (I thought that was teachers though, it's all theater and virtue signaling but I digress). Who cooks cleans does laundry yard work etc? That factors in too.", "NTA based of what I feel is a similar situation. I have a 6 month old baby and I am still on maternity leave. While I'm on maternity leave I am taking primary carer duties, I'm at home during the day and able to nap when my baby naps if I feel tired. I am also doing most of the chores around the house. In my opinion this seems fair and I do it willingly, my husband works very hard and needs sleep to safely do his job.", "NTA! You\u2019re getting up on the days you\u2019re not working. You helps out during your paternity leave. You will share duty once everyone is back to work. The fact she has help daily to assist with the baby the only one who is selfish is her right now. She can easily nap when baby is or when mom is there to help out. The fact people said she needs brakes clearly don\u2019t realize what you\u2019ve said and are helping. I don\u2019t know what planet they\u2019re on. Unless she was not getting help and the baby didn\u2019t nap maybe I can see it, but you\u2019re doing your share when you can.I had two babies and when I was on leave it was for me and I\u2019d never expect my husband to get up when I have the ability to sleep when the baby does. Never mind if I had a mom to watch while I\u2019ll nap. As long as you picked up the slack on weekends and days when you can I\u2019m all for it.", "NTA. Yes, she\u2019s tired.  But she can nap during the day and you cannot.  And you need to be able to drive safely on your commutes and if you are overly tired, that\u2019s a danger to you and everyone else on the road.  \n\nYou are not saying you will do no wake ups.  You are asking for the ability to sleep on the few days a week that your safety depends on sleep.  It\u2019s unreasonable for you to essentially do all of the wake ups while she\u2019s on maternity leave.  If you guys are going to split them when she\u2019s back to work full time in three months but not now, it honestly seems like you will get more sleep when she\u2019s back to work.  How does that make sense?", "NTA. This is completely reasonable to me and my husband. That\u2019s how we\u2019re rolling. My husband has always helps around the house, helps cooked meals, does his own laundry. I don\u2019t consider him selfish for needing a good nights sleep before going into work. I work, I know how it is. I feel it\u2019s doing my part to take on baby during nights and while he\u2019s at work. I have no doubt he\u2019ll contribute to nights when I\u2019m back to work or if I were sick and needed my rest more than him for a night or two.", "NTA - if you're waking at 5:45am to drive to work, you need to be alert enough to drive safely on those days.\nCould there be some kind of general compromise though? Instead of one parent doing every night wake, could you take alternate ones so that you both get longer sleep times? Eg, you do bedtime feed and midnight, she does 10pm and 2am. However your feed times fall. And maybe if baby tends to wake before you leave for work, you could do that one. But if your wife thinks you should do all night feeds just because she has baby all day, that's unreasonable.", "Nta.\n\nShe doesn't realise how lucky she is. If you're doing the night feeds when you wfh two nights plus the two weekend nights, you are doing the majority!\n\nPersonally, I think that if you need to do an overnight feed, that you should be doing the earlier feed in the hope of getting a block of sleep for work.\n\nHer expectations are unreasonable.", "NTA.  Your working full time and almost split it around 50/50 anyway with the weekend plus 2 days from work. NTA!", "NTA. Being a stay-at-home mom is a full time job. But when dad gets home, it\u2019s the baby responsibilities don\u2019t shift 100% to him. They become 50-50. Dad is willing to get up 4/7 nights, Mom should be able to do the other three. If you\u2019re both incapable of sharing that workload, you need to hire help. Otherwise, this should be able to be solved by making a schedule.", "NTA.... it's doesn't makes sense for you to split 50/50 while you need to work and she stays home... while she doesn't work she needs to take more house/baby responsibilities..\nWhen she's back to work go 50/50", "NTA - isn\u2019t this what maternity leave is for? She doesn\u2019t have to work and her mom is able to help during the day so she could nap if she wanted too. You guys need to sit down and discuss time management.", "NTA. I\u2019m currently a sahd and never wake my wife up when she has to work the next day. She should be sleeping when the baby sleeps.", "YTA She needs breaks! She needs more than an hour or so uninterrupted sleep. Being a sahp is the hardest job in the world because it's actually many, many jobs and you never get time off. Ever. Her brain and body need time to recharge just like yours. She IS working full time, same as you. Step up and take your turns.", "YTA. Your wife IS working full time just like you do. And one nap on a day her mom takes the baby is a drop in an ocean of exhaustion. Being an at-home parent during mat leave is 800% more work than your day job no matter how stressful it is or senior you are. You are treating her hours upon hours of feeding and pumping and changing and bathing and soothing and caring as \"not work\". STOP IT. When you get home from your non-screaming, non-pooping job, I will bet money she is an absolutely destroyed level of tired at 5 pm. She is as tired as you are at night from working all day. YTA. Get up at night and be a parent. With any luck, your daughter will be sleeping through the night soon. If that isn't happening and you need help, pay for a sleep consultant. My brother says it's the best money he ever spent.", "YTA and it's really rude to act like your wife \"doesn't work\" just because her work is caring for your child.", "I\u2019m not gonna go as far as saying YTA. But it takes two to make a baby. You can\u2019t expect her to be the one to get up and take care of the baby. Especially since she\u2019s home everyday with the baby. The least you can do is help in the middle of the night.\n\nEdit: OP is TA.", "YTA. Your wife is working a full time job, it\u2019s called taking care of a 3 month old.\n\nIf you are unable to help at night, then you need to hire a night nurse to help your wife. Or a daytime nanny so your wife can get some sleep.", "YTA. Would you ask one of your employees to be on call for 24 hours straight? You need to step up.", "[deleted]", "YTA - she's still getting paid, just like you. There is nothing you're doing at work that is more important than what she does at home, which apparently means being on call 24/7 for a baby and a man. Why is she cleaning anything if you're not getting up? God. She's TIRED.", "YTA. Get up and help.", "YTA\n\nI didn't need to read your entire post to make my judgement.\n\nLast time I checked, BOTH parents need to get up in the night to care of their baby, not just one person who does it all the time.\n\nMy mom (for a bit) didn't work full time, and yet my dad still got up in the middle of the night to care for us.", "YTA. This is your child too, it's time to step up and take responsibility", "YTA\n\nI get that your MIL is coming and giving your wife some help. But she still just gave birth 3 months ago. Her body is still recovering even if it doesn't seem like it. She sounds like she is overwhelmed (that doesn't mean its logical- but it's still real) and she is asking you for your help.\n\nIf your MIL comes for a bit and she spends the 5 hours doing chores she feels pressure to do so. If you're saying \"oh I wouldn't judge ...\" sorry bro kinda sounds like you are. \n\nIt sounds like you're kinda being stubborn about this, which is probably why she's freaking out. She's desperate her whole world is changed- and not that yours isn't too- but you get to go to an office a few days a week. For 8 plus hours a few days a week- you're still the same person you were pre-baby. _You even are getting a full night's rest with an infant._\n\nYour wife needs some support. Maternity leave isn't so the mom can take care of a baby by herself. It's so she can care for her baby AND _herself_. \n\nAs someone with a high-stress job- I get where you are coming from. The days I don't sleep definitely makes work a hell of a lot less pleasant. I think everyone empathizes with you there. Being a parent is a sacrifice. Your wife sacrificed her _body_.

Maybe if you take baby when you get home from work you can encourage your wife to go to bed early or even just have a nap for an hour before getting on with the day.

I figure that I will be waking up anyway and I want one of us to be sleeping. But I also will expect him to carry the load of parenting in other ways; for example, driving and other things that I can\u2019t do with sleep deprivation.

The arrangement you want is fair and reasonable.", "I was the SAHP for our kids. My partner worked full time and is also a heavy sleeper. I know Reddit hates that, but they were a heavy sleeper when I met them and they still are. It is what it is. With all three kids I was the one did all of the nighttime feedings and diapers during the week. Weekends we aimed to split it and we def did during the early newborn stage, but I still did most nighttime stuff. If something really went sideways like the baby was hungry and the toddler was puking, I could wake my partner no matter what night it was and they\u2019d help deal with everything (usually they got the puking toddler). The trade off for me doing all the night stuff was that on weekends my partner got up with the kids and I got to sleep in. During the week I tried to nap with the baby. That got harder once there were three of them, but we made it work. You don\u2019t sound like someone complaining about housework etc, so NTA. \n\nThat being said, you should try to get to the root of what\u2019s going on. Maybe MIL can babysit so you two can have an uninterrupted chat. Things don\u2019t sound great if your wife is screaming at you. Maybe suggest a housekeeper so she feels better about napping instead of doing chores? Does she like having her mom there? Sometimes that\u2019s helpful and sometimes it\u2019s not.

The extended uninterrupted sleep is what matters and it's hard to get in just naps and interrupted sleep at night, which is probably why your wife is passed she is missing her period of uninterrupted sleep. So figure out what your schedule needs to look like so you can both get 6 hours uninterrupted.", "NTA.\n\nFor the reasons others have posted.\n\nThe one thing I wanted to add, at least for my wife and I, it's not a static split.  When I get tired and want more rest time, she picks up the slack for a bit.  When she is tired, I will do more.  When we are both tired, we will let things go for a bit (taking out the trash can wait a day, you can go a day without vacuuming, etc.)", "NTA \nWhen I had my son I was a stay at home mom and would get up with him at night because my husband worked. When he came home he also took over and I went to bed early to counter the late night wake up calls. (I went to bed at 7)He took care of our son and did all the nighttime routines and put him to bed.

It\u2019s such a strong need/desire for some ppl even if they never say a word\u2026. and then comes the guilt for feeling this way when you are the mother.\n4) some ppl on low quality night sleep are really thrown out of balance. Add to that the hormones and you have yourself a rather explosive cocktail .\n\nHer paid maternity leave + your 6 weeks off make me think EU country. Not sure if it\u2019s everywhere already but in many EU countries fathers are also entitled to reduced hours, like a day off (Papadag) per week (yes, you also lose part of your income with it but in many cases the government reimburses a portion). Think whether that solution would be worth it for you two coz you don\u2019t have to lose those precious months and she can have a day where she can be herself.\n\nFirst year with a baby is not easy but if you work together you can come out on the other side without losses and resentment.

You mentioned she has help from her mum for a few hours, from my experience having to ask for help as a new mum is embarrassing and you feel like a failure as a mum due to not being able to be the perfect mum to baby and this can lead to postpartum depression. \n\nWe got told that when baby sleeps, we should sleep, but it isn't that easy. We still have to take care of the household, such as doing the cleaning, cooking, washing, going grocery shopping, etc. As well as feeding, changing, bottle prepping, and doing sensory play time and tummy time with our little ones.

Talk to her and ask her what she needs and what you can do to help. Maybe it's as simple as you do the nappy change at night and she does the feeding, or perhaps you give her an hour pamper session when you finish work so she can focus on self love for her mental wellbeing.

I also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep in general, so maybe that\u2019s all related, but regardless, I\u2019m not getting naps in no matter how much I want one. \n\nMy husband is a different story. He\u2019s never been the one who gets up at night cause our kids were/are both breastfed (yes, he could have done bottles with our first, but I was waking up to his cries anyways and I\u2019ve always had a harder time falling asleep so there wasn\u2019t any point to him getting up when I was already awake). Yes, he wakes up some nights, so he\u2019s not getting uninterrupted sleep every night, but he rolls right over when I say it\u2019s fine and falls asleep within seconds. He also naps a lot.

I understand that you don't think you have given her a reason to doubt your level of commitment, but fears are not always rational especially when you have a new baby and are sleep deprived and are hormonal\n\nmaybe something else is going on entirely \n\nI don't really know. not just because I don't know your wife and I don't know you, but also because **you can't even report to us what your wife says she thinks about these things**    \n\nmost people who intentionally avoid doing this do so in order to present the most misleading interpretation of events possible. because they are not coming here seriously questioning if they are in the wrong, but instead coming for validation  \n\nbut according to you, you're not coming here to prove yourself right, but because you're concerned because you don't normally have trouble understanding someone else's perspective (or at least understanding her perspective). so you ostensibly went into making this post concerned because you didn't understand her perspective, and then could not actually tell us her perspective on any of these things   \n\nyou told us why she you assume she should be able to nap during the day. and yet have somehow not had a conversation with your wife about whether or not she can nap during the day and whether or not that would help. you told us why you assume that her doing the night take wouldn't wreck her sleep schedule too much but have seemingly never had a conversation with her about this   \n\nthroughout the post you have anticipated possible concerns that the audience may have and then you allay them by telling us why you *assume* that they're actually not issues. so you thought to yourself that people might be concerned that she wasn't getting enough sleep and then went out of your way to assure us that if this was the case\n\nbut you didn't tell us \"I've talked to my wife and she said this wasn't the issue\"   \n\nand you didn't even tell us \"I never asked specifically about Y but whenever I raised this topic with my wife she said that the issue was X and has never raised Y as an issue\"  \n\nyou just told us how you ASSUME her sleep schedule can be adapted and how you ASSUME she won't have any issues with that, and then imply that if she does have sleep issues, it's because of her own incorrect choices   \n\nlook you're not always guaranteed to understand everything you're wife communicates and you're then not guaranteed to understand her perspective and motivations. and asking for outside perspective to help you understand is not the worst thing in the world\n\nbut you have to at least start by trying to have a conversation with her. and by that I don't mean bickering about who will do something, I mean sitting down and having an actual conversation. and for the health of both your marriage and your parenting relationship, this kind of communication should be ongoing and ideally proactive. if you had gone to her when you were getting ready to go back to work and discuss what the schedule changes were going to be like, you could have discovered any potential problems in advance. this lets you discuss and try and understand each other's perspective before problems actually happen. it lets you communicate and negotiate and make compromises before issues arise. this means when a situation is less pressured and less stressful and before people get upset\n\nthere is so so much in relationships and parenting that you do not have any way of preparing for in advance. but how your parenting schedule needed to change when you rent back into the office 3 days a week? that's not something that was suddenly sprung on you with no warning", "Uhh what\u2019s on her mind is that you\u2019re working for let\u2019s just say 10 hours and she is working for 24 on those nights.

My baby was up all night and didn\u2019t sleep well. Then he went to work in the morning (waking up at9/ 10, leaving half an hour later) leaving me again to care for the baby until he got home in the afternoon and he left for work again in the evening.\n\nSo for the first 6 weeks I slept like 3 hours per 24 hours. Meaning 1 hour in the night and 1 or 2 during the day. It was a bit better after that. Now he sleeps alright so I sleep better as well. Luckily your wife sleeps better, but if she has a hard time recovering then that might be a big problem as well. \n\nYes your wife has paid maternity leave but the broken nights might even be harder on her body because she is still recovering. Slee deprivation is already hard for you but her body is actually still recovering from child birth. That can take hp to one year (and sometimes even longer). \n\nAnd while you think work is hard, it is also hard to be at home with a baby all day. Does your wife feel valued?

My husband had a job which was normal hours, so less stress than OP's, but after the first few weeks, I acknowledged I was not coping with the broken sleep and was on the verge of an emotional breakdown. We made a deal that if it was feeding related screaming (IE it was time for a feed and son was crying), I would get up as it was pointless both of us getting up since I had to be up anyway. If my son was waking for any other reason, I would wake my husband and he would get up and just got to work tired. Admittedly, I didn't have my mother helping out after the first couple of weeks, so I can certainly get where OP is coming from. She can take a nap then. OP can't. Hopefully the two of them can come to a compromise that can work for them both. Maybe on days when OP's workload is not so heavy the next day, OP could take 1 night time shift.", "Yup!  I agree.
