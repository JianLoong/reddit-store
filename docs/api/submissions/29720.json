If the friendship ends at least you get to go to the concert and enjoy yourself. Happy Birthday to you! NTA at all.", "NTA, even if it was originally for her BF it's a nice gift. What she did afterward ruined it. Now you can use your second ticket to experience the concert with someone who isn't such an ass.", "NTA\n\nYour friend sucks. Why exactly are you friends with her in the first place. This is not how friends should act.", "NTA, at all. I wanted to see your friend's gift as well-intended but by the time I got deeper into the account, it became clear you are very much a footnote on her drama with her BF and her behavior towards you is SUPER inconsiderate and minimizing. She's too caught up in her drama to be a good friend is what it comes down to. Telling you you'd have to sit separately - that she'd essentially exchange the ticket she gave you in lieu of one far away - was especially callous. I don't blame you for being pissed off, especially after she took this shitstorm that SHE created and tried to badmouth you over it. This would definitely make me question the friendship.", "NTA. Why is she your friend? Maybe it's time to distance yourself from her.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. I hope you go with another friend and enjoy yourself. Who knows: by the time the concert rolls around, she might be giving away the boyfriend's ticket again!", "NTA take the tickets and ditch the friend completely. This level of drama isn't worth it.", "NTA OP.  This sounds like a \u201cfriend\u201d that you should let go of.", "Lol your friend sucks", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was originally a gift and in no way would you have to accommodate their requests.\n\nHaving said that, to say that they owe you a different birthday gift if you return the tickets sounds a bit entitled.", "NTA. Why is the boyfriend saying bad things about you if you never met him? This woman is not your friend, she is a drama Queen. Take the tickets and stop talking to her.", "Nta,  just give her the ticket back and ignore her fake protest.. it's what she wants.\n\nTell her to reach out when she breaks up with the dude... Dont worry, it'll only be a month or two.", "NTA\n\nresell the tickets amd buy yourself something nice.\n\nDon't bother to say anything and move on.\n\nStill want to keep as a friend, just know what kind of person she is.\n\nGood luck.

Seems like a lot of drama I\u2019m forced to be involved in when it\u2019s MY birthday gift lol", "Idk what happened! I thought this was something not worth being so upset over when it wasn\u2019t my mistake to fix up.

She just was refusing to accept the tickets back so I said if it\u2019s about giving me a gift, I\u2019m down for something else. No need to spend all the extra money", "I mean, at best, she has impulse control issues. She should not have offered you the ticket until she was absolutely sure that she wasn\u2019t just going to make up with him. She has made this very messy. Also, their relationship just sounds exhausting. I would not want to be around that.", "I'd drop the friend, she's sounds like an awful friend.", "Gotcha. Yeah, def NTA.", "Agree, but OP indicates they tried to just give the ticket back several times. Someone with impulse control would probably jump at the chance to 'undo' it. That's not how OP's friend replied, super annoying.", "Yeah, but no invitation should have been issued until the friend was absolutely certain they wanted to rehome the ticket. That is the impulse control issue to me. I can\u2019t stand those kind of couples who are constantly breaking up and making up and making it get all over everyone around them, forcing people to choose sides, just to get all lovey-dovey again. If the friend took the ticket back they know that they would be a stone cold asshole (\u201cI\u2019m not mad at him anymore and we made up! I will take that ticket back!\u201d)", "She has done this exact situation to me before. So she knew she couldn\u2019t take the ticket back without looking bad for the same incident"]}
