She's going to keep asking your to watch the your boyfriend's younger siblings \" for just one night\" until you start saying \"no\" and mean it. She's gotten comfortable with the arrangement and is banking on your pity.", "NTA. With things like this you have to establish boundaries and nip it in the bud. You can't just drop your kids off all the time on short notice.", "NTA. Now she's resorted to manipulating you with the Single Mom card, it's time you set boundaries with your BF's Mom, such as you need a certain number of days notice before the kids are dropped off or only a certain number of hours/overnights per month.\n\nAs you stated you both are young and have your own lives to lead.", "NTA at all. They are her children to raise, not hers. This is, by the way, one of the easiest verdicts I've seen on here lately.", "NTA but you and your BF need to be on the same page regarding this.", "NTA. If you don't create strong boundaries, she will walk all over you and things will never change for the better. I understand it's hard being a single mother, but there are resources out there for her that she needs to look into if she can't properly provide what her kids need. The burden shouldn't be put on anyone else.", "NTA. Mum needs to understand that even though she raised your BF it doesn't mean he's required to babysit. Since you're amenable to some sitting though, I'd respond with something like you love the kids & understand her situation but you need to have your own lives. Then lay out the calendar if you want & arrange dates for them to visit. No more dumping the kids unless it's an emergency.", "Nta", "Sounds like you need another conversation with his Mum. You need to establish between you what the bounds of reasonableness are. You want to be part of his siblings' lives, and you seem happy for them to stay with you from time to time, but you need to agree with Mum about how much you're prepared to have them.\n\nThere's no absolute answer to this - it's a choice. Some people in your situation would enjoy a regular one night a week arrangement. Others would think that monthly was more reasonable.\n\nBut you need to agree both roughly how often you're willing to have care of the kids, and whether you want this to be scheduled and planned well in advance, or whether you're happy with an ad hoc arrangement.\n\nThere aren't any wrong answers, but you need a proper conversation and some clarity about what each of you expects, rather than playing some kind of guilt game.\n\nNTA", "It should never be an expectation from a parent that siblings (or their siblings partners) be babysitters. Parents are responsible for raising their own kids.\nBeing a single parent can be hard but that\u2019s not their children\u2019s fault.\nThis woman is manipulating and using you guys. Set a hard line here. If your BF wants to spend time with his sibs that\u2019s for him to decide but you aren\u2019t required to help parent these kids. She needs to hire a babysitter for them.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI have different boundaries with different people. Mostly because certain individuals took advantage and I am not very firm with them.\n\nMy friend Delia never asks for babysitting unless it is an actual emergency. When she texts to say \"can you watch the kids\" I know something bad has happened. Or she will ask weeks in advance if she has plans and no one else is available. So I don't need to have talks with her about rules, because she has a good sense of my limitations already.\n\nBut with my cousin Hailey, I absolutely had to make firm rules. She pulled a lot of the same thing your MIL is doing. \n\nThis is the message I sent my cousin, maybe it will be helpful. \n\n>*I want to start out by saying I love seeing you (and the kids). You are really important to me and that's why I think this needs to be addressed. I am starting to feel overwhelmed and resentful about the amount of time you drop the kids off at my house.*   \n>  \n>*The last four times you came over, you have tried to leave while the kids are in the pool to pick up your dry cleaning, to go get groceries, to meet up with someone for lunch. You have then acted surprised when I told you, please takes the kids with you.*  \n>  \n>*While I love seeing you (with the kids) I am not comfortable babysitting. I also have things I need to be doing. While I am okay with you using the pool, I am not okay with the expectation that I am going to babysit for you. I have work, chores, and places I need to go. I do not have kids for a reason and while I love your kids... I don't enjoy being in charge of them.*   \n>  \n>*While I have offered to watch them in the past, it was always with weeks of advanced warning and at a time that works for me. I am not comfortable with this new expectation that I should be available to give you a break at the expense of my own responsibilities.*   \n>  \n>*So, while I understand it is hard being a single mother, I need you to understand my boundaries. You are allowed to come use the pool, but you have to be at the house while your children are here. You are not allowed to step out to go do errands, because I will not be watching your children.*  \n>  \n>*When you have an emergency, like  going to the hospital, I will be happy to help if I can. But I am not cancelling work because you \"cannot find a sitter.\" I should not lose out on wages for children that are not my own. You are the one who is  going to have to stay home from work.*   \n>  \n>*Please stop asking me to watch the kids while you have date nights, go shopping, etc. That is not what I am here for. I am your cousin and friend, I am not an oncall babysitter. Please respect that my time is also important and plan accordingly.*", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If not she and no one else has a right to complain", "NTA it isn't anyone's responsibility but her's and the father's, to raise these children. It doesn't matter that she is a single Mum. That isn't your problem and she isn't owed free childcare from you.", "NTA. This is a complete no-brainer: this woman's children are her responsibility, not yours. The fact that you generously choose to watch them sometimes does not obligate you to watch them at other times. Any reason you have for not choosing to watch them is valid and fine, from \"we've already made plans to be out of town\" to \"we just don't feel like it.\"", "I agree, just a challenging one for me as it isn\u2019t my family per se.", "Apologies for it maybe being a simple question, I just feel bad as she\u2019s kind of going through it and now I feel like I\u2019m adding to it.", "Agreed, I kind of feel like it\u2019s between my boyfriend and his Mum and I shouldn\u2019t be involved in the texting / agreeing. Which is why I also didn\u2019t really appreciate being asked today.", "Agreed we had offered previously to have them one evening overnight a week, but on weekdays as it would be significantly less disruptive but that didn\u2019t seem to suit.", "But it's your time and home. You have just as much of a right to say \"no\" as your boyfriend does", "You can feel sorry for her without enabling her behavior. Just say no thanks! Mom either hires babysitter or stays home.\n\nEither that or this never ends. If you feel really guilty, give her a scheduled 1 weekend a month that you'll have them.... On your terms", "You need to make firmer boundaries. Or retract the offer to babysit for a month because she's taking advantage of your generosity.", "Thanks for the response, agreed on the boundaries, obviously challenging as we do like seeing his siblings and we know they like staying with us.", "NTA because they\u2019re certainly not your responsibility but perhaps you and your boyfriend could come up with a schedule that works for you to have them over to hang out. 1 weeknight a month and 1 weekend or something. Whatever works for you. I bet the siblings would have a blast and mom would super appreciate it but it makes it on your terms. Again, you\u2019re obviously not obligated but it could go a long ways for everyone.", "NTA.\n\nAt the end of the day, her children are her responsibility. If she needs a sitter, she should probably find a permanent one that she has to pay for their time. It's fine for you and your bf to offer occasional help, but Mum is taking kindness for weakness here. By the way, what does she mean 'she hasn't had any time'? When you have children, it is the consequence of the job you sign up for. Where are these children's fathers? If anything, those are the people she needs to look towards.", "NTA. She's a single mom - she needs to stop having more kids. 3 kids and no fathers involved? She still hasn't figured out birth control?", "NTA You need to set up boundaries and you need more notice for babysitting, unless it\u2019s an emergency which it isn\u2019t.", "NTA mom is an Independent woman. She can handle her issues.", "Clearly the mother got the message from son thats why she called OP", "This is a really great message... May I ask.
