With things like this you have to establish boundaries and nip it in the bud. You can't just drop your kids off all the time on short notice.", "NTA. Now she's resorted to manipulating you with the Single Mom card, it's time you set boundaries with your BF's Mom, such as you need a certain number of days notice before the kids are dropped off or only a certain number of hours/overnights per month.\n\nAs you stated you both are young and have your own lives to lead.", "NTA at all. They are her children to raise, not hers. This is, by the way, one of the easiest verdicts I've seen on here lately.", "NTA but you and your BF need to be on the same page regarding this.", "NTA. If you don't create strong boundaries, she will walk all over you and things will never change for the better. I understand it's hard being a single mother, but there are resources out there for her that she needs to look into if she can't properly provide what her kids need. The burden shouldn't be put on anyone else.", "NTA. Mum needs to understand that even though she raised your BF it doesn't mean he's required to babysit. Since you're amenable to some sitting though, I'd respond with something like you love the kids & understand her situation but you need to have your own lives. Then lay out the calendar if you want & arrange dates for them to visit. No more dumping the kids unless it's an emergency.", "Nta", "Sounds like you need another conversation with his Mum. You need to establish between you what the bounds of reasonableness are. You want to be part of his siblings' lives, and you seem happy for them to stay with you from time to time, but you need to agree with Mum about how much you're prepared to have them.\n\nThere's no absolute answer to this - it's a choice. Some people in your situation would enjoy a regular one night a week arrangement. Others would think that monthly was more reasonable.\n\nBut you need to agree both roughly how often you're willing to have care of the kids, and whether you want this to be scheduled and planned well in advance, or whether you're happy with an ad hoc arrangement.\n\nThere aren't any wrong answers, but you need a proper conversation and some clarity about what each of you expects, rather than playing some kind of guilt game.\n\nNTA", "It should never be an expectation from a parent that siblings (or their siblings partners) be babysitters. Parents are responsible for raising their own kids.\nBeing a single parent can be hard but that\u2019s not their children\u2019s fault.\nThis woman is manipulating and using you guys. Set a hard line here. If your BF wants to spend time with his sibs that\u2019s for him to decide but you aren\u2019t required to help parent these kids. She needs to hire a babysitter for them.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI have different boundaries with different people. Mostly because certain individuals took advantage and I am not very firm with them.\n\nMy friend Delia never asks for babysitting unless it is an actual emergency. When she texts to say \"can you watch the kids\" I know something bad has happened. Or she will ask weeks in advance if she has plans and no one else is available. So I don't need to have talks with her about rules, because she has a good sense of my limitations already.\n\nBut with my cousin Hailey, I absolutely had to make firm rules. She pulled a lot of the same thing your MIL is doing. \n\nThis is the message I sent my cousin, maybe it will be helpful. \n\n>*I want to start out by saying I love seeing you (and the kids). You are really important to me and that's why I think this needs to be addressed. I am starting to feel overwhelmed and resentful about the amount of time you drop the kids off at my house.*   \n>  \n>*The last four times you came over, you have tried to leave while the kids are in the pool to pick up your dry cleaning, to go get groceries, to meet up with someone for lunch. You have then acted surprised when I told you, please takes the kids with you.*  \n>  \n>*While I love seeing you (with the kids) I am not comfortable babysitting. I also have things I need to be doing. While I am okay with you using the pool, I am not okay with the expectation that I am going to babysit for you. I have work, chores, and places I need to go. I do not have kids for a reason and while I love your kids... I don't enjoy being in charge of them.*   \n>  \n>*While I have offered to watch them in the past, it was always with weeks of advanced warning and at a time that works for me. I am not comfortable with this new expectation that I should be available to give you a break at the expense of my own responsibilities.*   \n>  \n>*So, while I understand it is hard being a single mother, I need you to understand my boundaries. You are allowed to come use the pool, but you have to be at the house while your children are here. You are not allowed to step out to go do errands, because I will not be watching your children.*  \n>  \n>*When you have an emergency, like  going to the hospital, I will be happy to help if I can. But I am not cancelling work because you \"cannot find a sitter.\" I should not lose out on wages for children that are not my own. You are the one who is  going to have to stay home from work.*   \n>  \n>*Please stop asking me to watch the kids while you have date nights, go shopping, etc. That is not what I am here for. I am your cousin and friend, I am not an oncall babysitter. Please respect that my time is also important and plan accordingly.*", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That isn't your problem and she isn't owed free childcare from you.", "NTA. This is a complete no-brainer: this woman's children are her responsibility, not yours.

If she needs a sitter, she should probably find a permanent one that she has to pay for their time. It's fine for you and your bf to offer occasional help, but Mum is taking kindness for weakness here. By the way, what does she mean 'she hasn't had any time'? When you have children, it is the consequence of the job you sign up for. Where are these children's fathers? If anything, those are the people she needs to look towards.", "NTA. She's a single mom - she needs to stop having more kids. 3 kids and no fathers involved?

Get an actual babysitter, someone who wants work and wants to be paid and have a night off without demanding other people look after your kids all the time.\n\nSure sometimes family can help out, I'm sure you both want to see them and occasionally have them over, but if it's been too much recently that you had a word about it and she's immediately asking again.\n\nSay no, draw a line in the sand, create a new way to establish the relationship by in a few weeks calling and saying you're free on some day and offer to have them over if she wants a night out.

I would be careful about lying about plans though. It doesn't sort the issue, just say sorry you cannot do this weekend.  \nMaybe have a chat to your bf about having a scheduled time(s) where you do take the boys if you do want to help.\nMaybe one weekend a month and dinner one night on other weeks? Pick something that works for you, and the boys enjoy. Then its up to bf's mum to utilise those scheduled times to 'recover' so she isnt unfairly asking you on short notice at other times.  \nI imagine she knows she is asking a bit much, hence the guily tripping.
