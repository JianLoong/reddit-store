He\u2019s 2 for crying out loud.  If he needs music/ASMR to sleep there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  Don\u2019t babysit anymore if you think you know better than the parent.", "YTA\n\nYou screwed up big time, for... what, exactly?

Some of these things are recommended by people who know more than you.\nIt's not your kid. You should have done the one simple thing she asked, she knows her child.

I would never allow you around my child after that.", "\"I took it upon myself to decide that this was really unhealthy so we were going to phase him out of watching the video\" \n\nYou took it upon yourself to enforce your will against a 2 year old. There was absolutely nothing wrong with his sleep routine, sure maybe it annoys YOU, but it helps HIM so that's what matters. \n\nYou know what's unhealthy, creating negative sleep associations in a toddler. The music wasn't hurting anyone, allowing a child to scream for hours on end is harmful and neglectful. The scream it out method created disregulated adults who can't process there emotions properly. \n\nGood job you traumatized a 2 year old because you decided you knew better then his Mom.

FOUR DAYS?!  Possibly 40+ fucking hours of pure screaming (8pm to 6am x4), you traumatized the fuck out of that 2 year old.\n\nPlease, PLEASE for the love of humanity, do NOT become a parent, stay the fuck away from children you maniac.\n\nYTMA (You're The Massive Asshole)", "YTA.\n\n*\u201cphase him out\u201d \u2026* what do you think this means?", "I go to sleep watching forensic files.

You clearly don't have any clue what is healthy or not since you let that poor baby scream and cry all night and go without sleep 5 nights in a row. Take a look at all the apps available that provide different types of noise for adults to sleep. I'm 62. I can't sleep without air flow and either the noise of a fan or rain/thunderstorm.
