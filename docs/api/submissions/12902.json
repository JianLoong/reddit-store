Unless you made the stuff on company time, you are not obligated to share, even when your boss asks. I agree that those employees should also have to put in the work.", "So, the boss wants you to coach these other middling employees so that they can compete for your job? No thanks. Seriously, your value as an employee goes down if there are a bunch of people who can do what you can do, plus they have 10 - 25 years more experience in another specialty.\n\nNTA Don't tell them about your study materials.", "Does your job contract state that teaching is part of your job description? If not, sucks to be them.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Is a single off hand remark going to ruin a successful career?  Not likely.  As long as you forget it, no problema.  If he doesn't forget it then your answer is ... it was a joke.  Sharing is another issue entirely.", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to share personal materials. What you can do is make another set and share the bare minimum notes on the certification exam. If they don\u2019t put in effort, their problem.\n\nYou only need to appear helpful and zip your mouth.", "My top concern if I were you would be that their possible failure would be held against me if I were conducting study sessions.

You might want to reconsider you approach here, despite your reasons being understandable.", "INFO did you create your materials on your own time? If yes, you need to talk with your boss on how you will be compensated for that.\n\nIf you created them during work hours, then ofc they should be shared and of course you should put your name on every document, as you made them.\n\nAlso it is not up to you to decide how your workplace trains new people. If your boss thinks you're a good trainer for them, then he can make that call. But you absolutely should ask for more money, as you are now training new people.", "Im split on this one....\n\nI get the part about people taking advantage of you and how you did this all in your own time. Your boss obviously thinks you did a great job at studing and gave you the complement of asking you to teach the rest. Maybe you can talk about a compensation for your work?\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, saying other people need to put in just as much work as you.... Pretty selfish to say others need to 'suffer' like you did.", "While I think NTA I don't unterstand your line of thought.\n\nI assume it's within reason to make you lead the study sessions during work hours. If that's the case, I think it will only make it harder for yourself, if you don't share your materials, since you will be in charge (at least to a certain degree) of their success.  \nIn addition, I think you want to have colleagues, who are suffieciently trained. If you make it harder on them, you can end up having less competent people around you -> more screw ups.", "I\u2019m not a fan of sharing materials that are personally paid for / created, even if it\u2019s related to a job. This can lead to being taken advantage of. I\u2019ve seen it happen more times than I can count.\n\nPerhaps a middle ground of pointing the co-workers towards materials they need to self-obtain and then guiding them at work.

Your employer can ask you to do a certain task, but they can't expect you to include private materials or take on additional responsibilities without negotiating for a raise.\n\nI would talk to your boss, explaining the costs/efforts for your materials and state that you'd be happy to share them if you are fairly compensated for the work you put into them (material costs + work time, calculate that beforehand). You can also check what an external tutor/trainer would charge if those exist for that. Lastly, teaching is an additional responsibility, so you should get a raise for that if it's not already part of your job description.", "Haven't we seen this one before?", "NTA- training and coaching and creating learning materials should be attached to a job title and commensurate pay.\nIf management isn't going to give you the appropriate title, pay, and materials to do that job, then they can't expect you to do so. This is a perfect example of \"acting your wage\".", "NTA. This might be one of those situations where you agree to do it but gosh darn it your memory you know?

They won't know if you give everything or not.  Also if you do, they may become company property.   You may also be held responsible for errors. You can produce simple slides or extracts.\n\n\\- Set clear expectations with boss.  For example, you will lead 6 sessions on topics you feel comfortable with, where you will run through basics. You can also include resources (links, paid products) they can look up.  You take no responsibility for them passing/failing.  Self study is still required and that's for them to manage, maybe they can set up study meets. You will also need to prepare materials during work hours and use work supplies, and must get help/overtime if your \"day job\" becomes busy.  Lastly, that you get some kind of benefit for the new responsibility, e.g. will he pay for you to do a presentation skills course if you want?  Is this going to affect your job security in any way once everyone has the same qual as you?\n\n\\-  He has to set clear expectations with these guys.  They are older, annoyed about having to study, but that is not your problem.  He needs to ensure that if they want to opt out, they discuss with him not take out on you\n\nProb more to think about than above..", "No. Coworkers and supervisors steal work. I even had one non direct supervisor not only stealy my work but try to correct me on it as if she changed anything (she didn't)", "NTA sounds like they don't want to put in real effort to get this certification and your boss is trying to save face. If he is offering time during work to teach them then teach them from whatever book(s) the certification is on. But your study materials that you made i would totally sell online. People will pay really good money for study materials to pass certifications. I read the other week about a nurse who makes seven figure selling her notes online. She loves being nurse so she still does it but her notes have made her very rich.\n\nEdit her name is Stephanee Beggs and she sells her notes on etsy", "It\u2019s a certification exam.

And why not do it together and pass on your knowledge.", "Thats why I put '' around the word suffer. It's not like real suffering but he wants them to go through what he went through. Also English isn't my first language and I didn't know how to put it otherwise :)", "So the attitude should be: sure I'll share them, as long as I will be paid for the time I spent making them, as I did not make them during work hours.", "He can lead them on the bare minimum to pass.

In short, those fellows will compete with him on promotion.Never ever help your rivals to get a one up on you, only keep them on equal or lower ground. \n\nThose who play too nice will never ever get promoted beyond a certain level. I learned that the hard way so I never give up trump cards like contacts or certain intricate details about my own methods to solve problems. So when push comes to shove, well, those cards come into play.\n\nGiving them the bare minimum to pass is already a gracious act. Also to cover him so that if the supervisor looks through the material , it won\u2019t look anymore or less than a standard guide book to pass the certification.If they don\u2019t bother, they don\u2019t pass.", "The part about paying for it was added later on. I thought it was more of a recap of gathered information he was talking about."]}
