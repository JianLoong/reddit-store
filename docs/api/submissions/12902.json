They won't know if you give everything or not.  Also if you do, they may become company property.   You may also be held responsible for errors. You can produce simple slides or extracts.\n\n\\- Set clear expectations with boss.  For example, you will lead 6 sessions on topics you feel comfortable with, where you will run through basics. You can also include resources (links, paid products) they can look up.  You take no responsibility for them passing/failing.  Self study is still required and that's for them to manage, maybe they can set up study meets. You will also need to prepare materials during work hours and use work supplies, and must get help/overtime if your \"day job\" becomes busy.  Lastly, that you get some kind of benefit for the new responsibility, e.g. will he pay for you to do a presentation skills course if you want?  Is this going to affect your job security in any way once everyone has the same qual as you?\n\n\\-  He has to set clear expectations with these guys.

If he is offering time during work to teach them then teach them from whatever book(s) the certification is on. But your study materials that you made i would totally sell online.

Maybe your joke didn't go over well but you make an excellent point - 'Hey Boss, thought about it a bit more, and I can definitely appreciate the team benefit and business need for us to have a fully staffed and certified team. However, given what time, energy, and finance I put into my study resources on my own time, I don't believe this would be either realistic for me to share my now reference material or to spend time on top of my regular duties now that I'm certified to teach people to bring them to this level.'\n\nCould end it there or ask for a reduction in workload, title to include Trainer, and compensation for the materials you purchased if they're to be used on the job.
