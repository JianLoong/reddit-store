Definitely not required but not unheard of.\n\nOP isn\u2019t an asshole for not wanting to share, but it is kind of a dumb move. By at least sharing their prep materials they have a rare chance to build goodwill and look good to their boss and coworkers without actually doing any extra work. I guess whether that would be being taken advantage of or just a good career move depends on OP\u2019s particular workplace.\n\nI don\u2019t really see how the coworkers are cutting corners or not pulling their weight. It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s asking OP to take the test for them, just help with studying. But again, it\u2019s fair for OP to say no.", "Being a \"team player'\" is the biggest load of crap out there. Same with taking on extra work. All that does is give the boss a reason to pile on more work for the same pay. Very little does that actually pay off. \n\nIt sounds like op is taken advantage of often. These engineers are 10 years his senior and don't want to study. Everyone in that job should be putting in the same amount of effort. That means putting in the time to do the research and study. \n\nWhich way do you think will help them retain the information better? Doing the research on their own or just being given the answers?", "One really hood lesson in this is to not disclose much about anything at work.  Boss knows you have that material and it would have served you better if he didn\u2019t.\n\nHe should have offered you a raise and promotion in exchange and he didn\u2019t.  But he is getting what he wants anyway.\n\nYou will now develop \u201cnew\u201d materials.  Actually those new materials will be created from the materials of your own that your company did not pay for.  So now, you will essentially be freshening up a program you already developed on your own time; but this one will belong to your company.\n\nThat you recently passed the certification test also means your current insight into what needs to be studied a lot and what the psychology of the test is, can be given to your students so they don\u2019t have to work so hard. \n\nTwo things to consider here.  This is why your boss is the boss. He knows how to make lemonade out of lemons and he really understands human nature. \n\nOne of those students of yours will get the certification and be promoted above you. \n\nMany wealthy people who own businesses involving key and innovative technology have little knowledge of the work involved in developing the products.\n\nThey hire people to do all that (engineers, artists, sales people, etc.) and they turn their creative talent into a product they can buy and then control.", "NTA", "NTA but tread carefully, you are young and just starting.  You absolutely want to focus the work you were hired and studied hard to do.  You don\u2019t want to become the trainer.  \nI think the best message to the boss is \u201cI\u2019m willing to lead a few study sessions if they\u2019re willing, but I want to focus on our core project and career advancement.\u201d", "NTA, you did mess up with the joke, because that most likely sounded like you were complaining about how much work, instead of the kind of work, which is what you're objecting. A better response would have been: \"This sounds like a project that's out of scope for my current job description. I'm not sure I'm comfortable using my *personal* study materials for this task. I think I would not be the best person for this task. As the certification is necessary to be employed here, there should be a more \"official\" tutor program developed to help out new employees, but I am not interested in taking on that project\". \n\nAnd honestly? If your company is as \"respected\" as you claim, I'm shocked your company doesn't already have this in place. My company, although likely in a different industry, has a similar requirement to yours with regards to certification. But we have a whole class dedicated towards getting people certified, and it's done on a company, not departmental level. Unless your title is \"training coordinator\", it seems inappropriate to ask you to develop a tutoring group, especially using your own personal study materials.", "Your supervisor would do better to compile some materials for them to study from and then pass them out to all and sundry.

I was in IT and the only person supporting a system. There use to be multiple people and management did not backfill when they left. I caught them by surprise when I submitted my resignation. Of course, in the remaining weeks they asked me to train a couple of people. My response was, I would not train people, but I would do turnover. Basically, verbally walking people through what I did and what the procedures were. Of course, they didn't take notes and the boss said to 'make them'. I laughed and said not my job. They were thinking they could call me for help after I left. And when they did call, I told them they never established a support contract.

Also, make sure that you're being paid above these new people if you're being depended on to train THEM.  And don't joke about things, say things outright.

He would say \"this is one of your 'other duties as required'.\" It was great, but most bosses don't use it that way lol.", "OP is not being put \"in charge\" of employees with 10-25 years experience on them.

You really think OP will be in charge of someone with 25 years seniority once they're all certified?    \n     \nTrust me, as someone who's never pushed back on doing things outside my job description, you don't end up with the promotion you just end up being the person everyone dumps their unwanted shit onto.

Dumping it on a new hire, particularly without having reviewed the materials is just a recipe for another problem, IMO.", "Your boss saying \"hey we need these reports by wednesday so you're gonna have to stay late\" while everyone else ducks out early is being a doormat. Look, work relationships are interpersonal relationships and not all business like redditors treat it. Your boss asked for a favor that requires no extra work on your end when he asked you to send the notes. You're not a doormat for saying \"sure\" and you won't get in trouble for saying no, but pretty much universally, anyone in your boss' position would think you're an asshole for it and would treat you less for it. If you don't want to do favors at work, that's your prerogative but work is just as much a social game as anything else involving contact with people. \n\nRefusing to do training would be much more understandable to the majority of people and he most likely wouldn't think anything of it if you didn't feel comfortable doing it.

That seems like a smart compromise. \n\nIn regards to your notes though, I\u2019d bet that part of what made them so valuable to you is how much you learned from making them.  And consequently, no matter how wonderful they are, they would be useless to people who don\u2019t want to study them.", "NTA   I had a manger like that.  Refused to pay for an outside class and refused to let me use the company training code for time.

You are certainly right to worry and right to balk at giving your work a huge freebie.\n\nI accidentally taught my two co-workers that they didn't want to work as hard as I did on my project and not get rewarded for it because it failed due to circumstances that had nothing to do with my work. So, when their projects were completed with review still pending, they marched down to HR and demanded promotions.  \n\nBoth ended up promoted a step above me (I had many more years of experience) and one ended up being my boss later. He later got VERY angry at me when I gave it as an example, in a roundtable with his boss and all our larger group, when in a blind survey those employees in the group complained that promotions being tied to project success, not to personal performance, as a problem.  I had just found out my mom had cancer just before the meeting, so my filter was out to lunch. He used to come into work late and make me work late to meet with him. A few years later we went out to a company dinner to celebrate a project I completed successfully. I handed him my resignation letter on our way out to dinner.", "I understand completely.

Maybe \"oh cool, another study guide\" at best. Humble pie for dessert!", "This is delusional about women in STEM career.  And how the data shows that women do the \"non-promotable\" work, and end up working more for less promotions.  And this is a classic example- she can't win.

I tend to share a lot- but my feild is very in demand, and my work is \"promotable\" when I share. Meaning it contributes to me getting a promotion (I have been promoted 2X early, already, for example, and it was based on this work, in part). But I have been in many roles where I was responsible for fixing many male colleagues screw ups, and had to fight tooth and nail to get a promotion, raise, and still made less than they did.
