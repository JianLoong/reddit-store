{"id": 17271, "submission_id": "13hzak1", "title": "AITA for backing out of my best friend\u2019s wedding 11 days out?", "selftext": "My best friend got engaged a year ago. She asked me to be maid of honour straight away and I said yes. For context to the rest of the story, I am married with a toddler but have an older child to my ex partner. \nHer wedding is 26th of May. I ended up falling pregnant in September 2022 and am due in June 2023. She expressed her disdain for my falling pregnant but we kind of just let it go and agreed I could still attend heavily pregnant. \nFast forward to January/February 2023. My husband is unexplainably sick. Constant headaches, loss of appetite etc. AN MRI and CAT scan ended up showing that he has a small tumour on the brain and a vicious, golf ball-sized tumour in his throat. His throat tumour needs to be removed asap and this will cost us $20,000. As a result of his health and also the financial aspect of it, I told my friend I was unable to attend her bachelorette party which I had paid $350 for my spot for, and she said that\u2019s fine but I won\u2019t be getting refunded. And I said okay. \nSo around March she starts saying I need to alter my dress, get a professional manicure and pedicure, get my $80 high heels, and also a few other things I need to pay for. I\u2019m still struggling financially at this point but I say okay I\u2019ll get it done. \nFast forward to last week. My eldest daughter\u2019s dad (my ex), has broken his leg. Unable to walk or do shared custody with our daughter until further notice as he is in crutches and rehabilitating his leg. So at this point I have a sick husband and an injured ex, so I\u2019ve been looking after the kids pretty much on my own while being 8 months pregnant. \nYesterday I go to my hospital appointment for my check up, I\u2019m not doing too good it seems. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with preeclampsia, barely passed my gestational diabetes test and to be frank, my weight gain and other things during this pregnancy (such as preeclampsia running in my family) is causing myself and the baby some issues. I can barely walk, I need to rest as my heart rate is through the roof at all times and I need to take a break I\u2019m told (I work full time on top of looking after my kids alone while pregnant). \nSo I messaged my best friend today saying I\u2019m really sorry but can she replace me in the wedding, my healthy is struggling, my pregnancy is taking a toll but I can still cover some things financially. Well, she is pissed. Said the wedding is less than two weeks away and I cannot be replaced. I don\u2019t know what to respond at this point. AITA? I definitely feel like it, but this has been one of the worst years of my life and this is without a doubt my hardest pregnancy. I can\u2019t even breathe properly. Also, do I suck it up and just go?", "created_utc": 1684130226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hzak1/aita_for_backing_out_of_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s really hard and expensive to maintain the kind of monitoring and possible need for immediate access to medical attention that go with preeclampsia.  No, you shouldn\u2019t suck it up and go - that\u2019d be risking your safety and that of your baby.  Unless she\u2019s willing to really listen and learn about preeclampsia, she may never understand the kinds of risks you\u2019d be taking to go.  Stay home, keep your stress as low as you can, and be kind to yourself. NTA", "NTA - I am so sorry for all you are going through, you have been dealt a really crappy hand. First and foremost you must protect your health, and your baby. Then you have your husband and other children to look after.

If my own mother was going through all you are right now I would have given her a pass to miss my wedding tbh.", "NTA.\n\nYou're dealing with a landslide of painful, stressful, expensive life events. If she can't accept the fact that you have a lot of critically important things to deal with, then why should you still consider her a friend? Circumstances like this lay bare what relationships are made of and this one is woefully unbalanced in her favor.\n\nCut your losses and get some rest.", "NTA. Your health and your family matter the most here. Your \"best friend\" - sorry to say - is not acting like it at all.

Let me know if it's best we take all my wedding stuff off your plate!\"*\n\nTake care of the people that need you right now (that means you most of all).

Don't continue to discuss it with her. Her stress doesn't need to be yours.", "Nta. Your friend has a right to be disappointed but her reaction is selfish and uncaring every step of the way. She did nothing to mitigate your expenses or stress. Everything you are dealing with, financially, physically and emotionally are all more important than her wedding.

Sending good thoughts your way. And h$** no, you are NTA. It comes down to this: a choice between inconveniencing/disappointing someone on their \u201cspecial day\u201d \u2014 or putting the health, well-being, and possible life of you and your baby at risk. The medical conditions you describe could lead to some serious, possibly life-changing complications for you and the baby if you don\u2019t take care of yourself as directed by your doctor. Not really a choice at all, when you look at it that way. Best of luck to you are your family.", "Oof, hard NTA. Your best friend is in her \u201ewedding world\u201c and is being selfish, as some brides are wont to do. You need rest, not a party. You need to take care of the most important (and let\u2019s be frank here \u2014 preeclampsia is a very serious and sometimes life threatening condition) things in your life, and your health/family come first. \n\nHonestly, your friend should have come up with a backup plan when you told her about your/your husband\u2019s condition early this year. \n\nPrioritizing these things doesn\u2019t make you a bad friend, it\u2019s what good parents do.

The other 2 will know you're only asking to balance it out)", "Absolutely NTA and if the bride was any sort of a decent friend she would understand, even if she was initially disappointed.

You deserve better.", "NTA my daughter had pre eclampsia with 2 pregnancies and its no joke. Add the husband and ex that can't be relied on right now and you're in a mess.

Don't risk yours or baby's health.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have asked can she find someone else, as that sounds like you\u2019re trying to see if you can get out of it but you might go if she can\u2019t replace you.
