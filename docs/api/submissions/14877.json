You should be too allowed to talk. Personally I'd be bored after 3 minutes about sports, but that's no excuse to tell you to shut up. \nI listened to my twin sister for hours on end about horses, because they matter to her. It doesn't matter that they are off no interest to me, I care about her so she gets to talk to me about the stuff that's important to her. She had to endure loss of political discussions from the rest of us, so it's only fair she also gets to talk about stuff that interest her.\n\nYour mum is showing you she cares more about your siblings and I'm so sorry for you.
