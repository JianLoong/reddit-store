You should be too allowed to talk.

It doesn't matter that they are off no interest to me, I care about her so she gets to talk to me about the stuff that's important to her.

Sometimes we choose not to (we see it as respect for our elders etc) and sometimes there\u2019s not an actual choice to be made. Sometimes we blurt it out. Sometimes it\u2019s planned. But either which way you slice it, bottling emotions up and not having your mother as a shoulder to lean on when having a bad day/week etc, leads to unresolved issues and can result in needing therapy when we\u2019re older. And results in a lifetime of disappointment in the one person you should be able to talk to about everything. \n\nTake it from someone who grew up with a manipulative narcissist for a mother. I ended up resenting mine for a myriad of reasons. I could write a book about it (and actually, I do write, and oft times will include a shitty mother \ud83d\ude43) but we\u2019d be here until eternity trying to list all the ways in which she let me down. Therapy didn\u2019t do me any good, but cutting her off when I was 18 greatly improved my life. \n\nOf course, I\u2019m not suggesting cutting your mother off the second you are able\u2014even though it may well come to that\u2014I\u2019m just stating what did me some good.\n\nFor the sake of your mental health, find someone else you trust to talk to, because it seems inconceivable that mom will want/be able to give good advice. If you can\u2019t talk to her, and you can\u2019t bottle things up, then I suggest confiding in a close friend/relative/guidance counsellor at school. \n\nAs for the one throwaway comment that she\u2019s shitty, it sounds like she deserved it. I wouldn\u2019t walk around calling her out on every little thing, because she\u2019ll undoubtedly make life harder for you. But you\u2019re not TA for standing up for yourself. \n\nAs you get older, you\u2019ll find ways to cope, ways to be assertive, and time will bring clarity on some things. But until then, find a responsible person that you trust and talk to them. \n\nHere\u2019s a <**virtual hug**> from an internet stranger who knows what it\u2019s like.", "NTA.
