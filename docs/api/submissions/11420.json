He doesn\u2019t get to decide that it\u2019s fine he violated you and he can come back now. Even insisting if he moves in he gets therapy is not enough. MAYBE he can prove next year that he took this seriously and could move back in if he goes to weekly therapy appointments. But honestly, therapy may not help him enough and I would never trust him again. He is gaslighting you hardcore by moving your underwear around, too.

If he kept rummaging through your underwear AFTER getting caught taking pictures of you getting out of the shower at the age of 15, he needs extremely serious help.  Knowing what he does is wrong and that he will face punishment for doing it is not a deterrent, which will encourage him to just get better at hiding it since he feels no guilt. This will make your daughters prime targets since children can be groomed and manipulated or threatened into silence relatively easily.

People are talking about him being in therapy in order to return, as if therapy is some sort of magic wand that will make everything okay.

In the meantime, your duty is to ensure you and your young children are safe, and they are not safe with him living in the home. Neither are you.

You could never feel at ease. He would have to submit to parental controls on everything and full password disclosure. God knows where he got this weird idea from (unfortunately it feels a bit like some twisted porn site which means it\u2019s likely to have gotten worse since). He really should stay at his mothers. The fact he is acting like nothing happened makes it sound a little like he has some kind of disorder and if this is not addressed asap it will only continue to fester and grow. I don\u2019t know the law where you are but I think if that was reported to the police here in the U.K. a 16 year old can be charged with sexual misconduct (although not named) so what he did would be a crime and on his record. You have other vulnerable people than just yourself to think about too and you cannot take the risk. He should have been told the first time it was either the therapists office or the police station if we are being honest. I know in the moment it must have been terrible and very hard to think straight but my concern is that his father failed him by not taking the hard line at that point. As a victim of assault at a young age I can tell you that while I am a well adjusted adult it carried over into the rest of my life far more than I realised at the time and it is only with maturity I have gained the insight into the damage it does. There should be no way he was allowed to simply move to his mums because there is no way to know if there was anything else he was doing as this was not addressed I assume. It\u2019s terrifying that he is acting like it didn\u2019t happen, like he is devoid of shame or guilt. Those are two things liked to sociopaths among many other issues and he needs help.\nYou cannot allow him back into your home with others at risk in good conscience. Your gut is telling you that already and it js not you that should feel guilty.", "NTA. Nope nope nope. No way. Keep him out of your house. He\u2019s an unconvicted sex offender.

He definitely needs therapy before he does something even crazier. He's going thru puberty boys and is confused.

Ask what they would advise, I imagine they will suggest therapy for your son for some time before you move to seeing one another and I doubt they would suggest living together or even doing over nights until the therapist has seen a good change in attitude, progress, etc. This situation has harmed you, harmed your entire family and any maladaptive behaviour which is strongly linked to sex is something which needs treating for the good of everyone around your son, including himself. Hopefully this can be worked through but for his own well-being and safety around others, he needs proper professional treatment and he cannot live with you.

If he would do those things to you, there has to also be a question of what he might do to other family members.

Until you\u2019re able to prove to me that I can trust you in the house again, you\u2019re not welcome back. We can have a discussion about what you need to do to gain my trust when you\u2019re ready.\u201d", "I\u2019d say no.", "NTA Therapy is a must for this kid, but whether or not he agrees to therapy OP, therapy would be helpful for you and your husband as well. [https://www.ncsby.org/content/introduction-0](https://www.ncsby.org/content/introduction-0) may be a good place to start.", "NTA. He violated you and your privacy. You don't feel comfortable around him and you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home. He needs to show that he's willing to do the work. Maybe a year of therapy at his mom's and then reevaluate from there.", "NTA \n\nI also would feel uncomfortable with him at home after what happened.\n\nBut if you ever want to give him another chance, you should demand for him to get therapy. What he did should be discussed with someone who can help him. You can't brush it under the carpet as if nothing ever happened.", "NAH. But this is way above AITA pay grade. Therapy is needed for both of you whether it's joint or separate. You see him as a sexual deviant. I see a regular hormonal teenager who is curious about the opposite sex and you are the only person he can get answers. Do you and/or your husband talk to him about sex at all? Not the mechanics of it all but what he is going through as a young man who is just being aware of his own sexual feelings. If your family is very conservative and removes any kind of sexual type of material, then you become the key to his growing curiosity. It's why so many older sisters call their younger brothers perverts.", "NTA. Before moving in is even considered, the stepson should be in counseling and cooperative whilst in it. Stepson should agree that counseling sessions should be closely monitored - not that father should attend any counseling sessions, but that he should be able to contact counselor with stepson's permission and be sure the counseling sessions are productive. Father doesn't need to know specifics, but he does need to know the stepson is being cooperative, working through issues, etc., not just watching the clock until his shift is over.", "NTA. You need to protect your daughter's. Don't let him back in the house.", "NTA. You don't feel safe in your own home with him around. That's a full set of luggage to be worked out before he could move back. He definitely burned the bridge with you and you're clearly not ready to rebuild which is ok.", "Wow ESH.... He's 12; inappropriate yes; normal behavior for a tween going into puberty? Also a Yes.... He displays it differently then the average but the curiosity is completely normal and honestly psychologically expected considered how home life. Get him therapy separately and get therapy together.... and get over yourself", ">I\u2019d say the therapy is the minimum requirement for stepson to return to the house,\n\nWhat he did was so invasive I don't see ever letting him back in.  Taking photos of his stepmom nude and rummaging through her panties is such a violation.\n\nHe is 16 now so somebody needs to house him and that should probably be his mom.  Unless he comes to terms that what he did is wrong and apologizes he should not be let in the house.  \n\nCan he change?  Sure.  None of us are the same person we were at 16.  But unless he exhibits some change BEFORE he moves in the answer is no.", "Agreed. OP is NTA, but this kid needs serious help.  He's got the start of some criminal activity going on there, and he's too old to say, \"Oh, he's just experimenting with sexual feelings, etc\" - he's not a small child.  He's old enough to know what's appropriate and what's not - taking photos of a woman without her knowledge AND rummaging through the underwear - that's a deal breaker.  He doesn't need to come back to your house, but there needs to be some sort of action taken so that his bio mom knows what he's done and agrees to get him the help he needs.", "At the MINIMUM he needs to go to therapy, as planned before his \"escape\".  Let him know his short absence doesn't change what's necessary to fix this.  His actions are those of a predator and cannot be ignored.  Make sure you meet with the therapist first to make them aware of your feelings about what he did to you, as well as your fears regarding your young children which, let's face it, is the big fear here.  As others have said, it will be much easier for him to prey on his younger siblings \\*without you ever knowing\\*.  Think about that for a second and your mind might explode.", "Nta obviously. Lets be honest - your stepkid was a pervert and the manipulative one if he got his way and ended up not going to the therapy. Ask husband if you had a daughter who did the same as his kid, would he be as much understanding. \nWho knows if he got mental issues, did not he jump to harras his half siblings? Also: what is the reason he wants to come back? Did he do the same to his mother?", "I feel like the son should be required to be to therapy before coming back and locks on the bathroom doors", "My uncle married a woman with two older boys and one of them behaved almost exactly like OP's stepson did. This kid definitely did things to his two younger siblings and he's in prison now for other crimes. Stuff like this is serious. I don't think I'd want stepson back if I had younger children in the house.", "That\u2019s the best response. You are in a horrible position but ultimately, this was a kind of sexual abuse and you shouldn\u2019t have to live with someone who has sexually abused you. I\u2019d be so worried about behaviour escalating to involve your other children because he clearly doesn\u2019t have appropriate or healthy sexual behaviours. \n\nTherapy is a great idea and you should know that if he ever moves back in down the line, therapists are required to report cases where someone is at risk of abuse. A therapist may well interpret the situation as being too risky for you other children and involve CPS. \n\nWhile a continued relationship with him might make sense down the line, in my opinion it  wouldn\u2019t be worth the potential risk to your other children. You also shouldn\u2019t let him be alone with them under any circumstances.", "I think you are making the right decision not allowing him back. Everyone needs therapy. \n\nI also want to point out that your stepson is at the high school age, and in the US and many other places that is a terrible time to switch schools. For his own sake he should stay with his mom and focus on school and self-improvement including therapy.", "It makes me uncomfortable to say, he may want to come back bc he misses not seeing you sexually.  It\u2019s disgusting and depraved, but I would not let this kid back at all. You are not safe. I\u2019m sorry that this child has turned out this way, but you are not wrong for wanting to stay safe. Please get therapy started for everyone to process this. I just wanted to be another voice to support you.", "Your stepson is a sexual abuser.  Regular therapists don't generally have the training to treat repeat sexual offenders.  He needs specialized sex offender treatment. \n\nAs someone who clearly has a fetish for forbidden, familial sex, I wouldn't let him anywhere near your kid", "The message is: \n\nsexual predators not allowed", "That info doesn\u2019t seem necessary. It makes it Sound like you are trying to blame the victim here? I don\u2019t care how easy it can be done, it is a pretty universal concept that you don\u2019t take a pic of someone naked unless they explicitly consent to it. It\u2019s fucking predatory to do that without consent, and lying about it after shows he knew he was in the wrong. Also, being naked in your own home getting out of the shower is not consent. GTFOH with that opportunity BS.\n\nMy parents never locked the bathroom door when taking a shower\u2026because safety. Especially if they are the only adult home with the kids at that time. If something happens kids need to be able to come in and tell them. They simply taught us not to walk in when people were in the shower, unless it was an emergency, and we had no problem with that. I never once had the thought to take a picture of someone getting out of the shower.", "> However, he was 15. Judging him to the standard of an adult isn't fair either. \n\nHe\u2019s being held to the standards of an 8yo. You _don\u2019t_ spy on people in the shower. You _don\u2019t_ take pictures of them naked. None of these are exceptional & OP shouldn\u2019t have to put locks on doors to protect herself. \n\nIs the baby supposed to lock herself in to her room  so the 15yo doesn\u2019t take pictures of her genitals?", "I don't know if the statement 'a sexual criminal, juvenile or not, does not get to come home to their victim' is true. I don't know if it should be true. Are you a legal specialist? (Serious question) It probably depends on the crime, the age, the intent, the individuals. \nIt looks like you're imagining something specific, as are the people who upvote you", "OP has since addressed this. It was a typo...she meant he DOES want him to go to therapy.", "He didn\u2019t take it seriously if he didn\u2019t demand on therapy months ago. He doesn\u2019t take it seriously if he\u2019s trying to make you the bad guy. Your husband sucks.", "If your husband actually had your back, you wouldn\u2019t be the one making this decision. He would tell that boy that he is not allowed around his wife. Your stepson is legally old enough to drive and get a part time job in most states. By the time his therapy will be over, he\u2019ll be old enough to have his own place. This isn\u2019t a baby. It\u2019s an adolescent on their way to adulthood.", "You can lift someone without needling someone else. Especially someone who seems to be doing the best that he can in an impossible situation.", "Btw\u2026. His actions do not, in any way, constitute taking this seriously. \n\nWhat his son did, as i am sure you know, is a very serious crime. That the kid was not put in therapy from day 1 is WRONG. He is a threat to women everywhere, and it is his fathers job to do everything in his power to course correct this before he victimizes another person. Once he hits 18 he is in the laws hands. \n\nThe father is sweeping this under the rug. Its all \u201cboys will be boys\u201d until this kid rapes someone. Or at minimum takes more pictures but the next person will press charges and his life will be ruined: this will follow him forever.  \n\nThis is a \u201csee specialists and formulate a years-long strategy\u201d level problem\u2026 not \u201cwell MaYbE we will go therapy\u201d\u2026. He is a menace and needs to be treated like such.", "Does his mother know what happened? If she doesn't, your husband needs to tell her. This boy needs to be required to go to therapy with someone who specializes in sexual issues. You're absolutely in the right for not wanting him to come back. Your husband also has a duty to try and protect others if he can.", "I have the same thought. He isn't acknowledging anything, so how to make sure the other children will be safe, too?", "That\u2019s incredibly passive and places the onus entirely on OP who is the victim. Now she\u2019s made to make a final difficult decision while he\u2019s just like whatever you say dear \n\nHe also didn\u2019t push therapy.", "A sexual criminal SHOULD NOT get to come home and live with their victim. They're not saying this is a legally binding thing, especially since the opposite scenario happens all the freakin' time. Sexual criminals usually don't get sent away from their victims, they often stay and continue to victimize people until the victim themselves leave.", "This - family offenders aren't always preferential offenders, so age and gender might not matter to the stepson.", "Yes, this! He\u2019s proven to be something dangerously unethical with deviant sexual inclinations directed at you, not the person you thought he was, OP. He should not be welcomed back into your life and his siblings should be warned as they age and kept safe from him.", "Huh? The post says that the Husband wants the son to go to therapy, even if the son isn't coming back.", "To be fair OPs typo on whether the husband wanted the son in therapy or not was a big context change.", "So you would put the baby daughter in danger is SA? Or do you want to claim that therapy would completely erase the chance of that  like it\u2019s a magic pill ?", "I think it's actually more serious than Therapy...This is a sexual predator even if they haven't been brought before the courts! Any mandatory reporter who knew this would have to report to Child Welfare due to the little ones in the house!", ">My husband pretty much let\u2019s me call the shots however he does want to make him go to therapy whether he comes back or not\n\nDon't make things up. There is literally evidence of the OP saying the exact opposite of that. She's calling the shots. Why you lyyyyyyying", "Op therapy needs to happen BEFORE HE CAN COME BACK and have results. Not just go and say nothing to the therapist. Nta", "That\u2019s not ok. He\u2019s well aware of what is and isn\u2019t ideal. He needs to own the decision.", "I think it\u2019s crap that your husband is leaving this decision up to you. His son has exhibited disturbing behavior. Even if your husband\u2019s thought process is, \u201cOP is an adult that can assess her own safety in a situation,\u201d there are other young children in the home, who I assume are ALSO your husband\u2019s children. Your husband must be in denial if he hasn\u2019t immediately made the decision (by himself) that the safety of his other children means that his son cannot possibly live in your home again.", "Nta. Your husband is forcing you into the role of bad guy by leaving it up to you and then not supporting you in that role by not backing you when you insist on therapy, so he's making you be the bad guy after you were the victim instead of standing up to his pervy son. You deserve better. How is this relationship going to work when he pervs on your daughters and your husband does nothing?", "[OP mentioned that she made a typo for that specific wording.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hnhnn/aita_step_son_moved_out_and_now_wants_to_come/jausgtg/)", "OP doesn\u2019t appear to understand reddit editing etiquette.", "He is a parent.
