There\u2019s no papering over this and pretending it never happened. Your stepson needs to do some soul-searching and acknowledge his role in making you uncomfortable to live in the house with him.

I say keep him out.", "NTA. Your stepson is essentially a predator and created an unsafe environment. No is an acceptable answer, and it is alarming that he is pretending like nothing happened.", "NTA. That's very questionable.

The other issue I have is your other daughters. They will need protection from him.", "Actually, don't even let him back unless he is **already** going to therapy. For at least a few months.

He doesn't need back in your house, and I don't know how you could feel safe with him there, therapy or not, because if he was a stranger or another relative you wouldn't want him there so why would you accept your stepson?\n\nIf he's this obsessive about you sexually, you don't know his potential feelings about the other children in the house either.  Too many parents have tried to sweep this behavior under the rug thinking that therapy will work it out of the him while they continue living in the home (many news worthy examples are out there).  You need to protect yourself and your children.  This is a boundary your husband needs to be with you on.", "NTA\nThis is seriously disturbing and he needs to be in therapy. If he did this to you while you were his mother figure, I would wonder if he would start doing the same thing to your daughters.", "NTA. Under no conditions would I allow him to return.

He doesn\u2019t get to decide that it\u2019s fine he violated you and he can come back now. Even insisting if he moves in he gets therapy is not enough. MAYBE he can prove next year that he took this seriously and could move back in if he goes to weekly therapy appointments. But honestly, therapy may not help him enough and I would never trust him again. He is gaslighting you hardcore by moving your underwear around, too.

Stick to it.", "YWBTA if you tell him that, though I totally understand why you want to!  I think a far better solution would be offer to do online family therapy once a week exploring his behavior and how to fix it and then revisit coming home.

My question is why is he wanting to leave his mother's house? Was he taking pictures there too?", "That is sexually predatory behavior, as you obviously realize. Were it just you and your husband, I'd say maybe give him a chance with a mountain of therapy, but I don't think there's enough therapy in the entire world that would make me feel comfortable putting him around my small daughters. If he kept rummaging through your underwear AFTER getting caught taking pictures of you getting out of the shower at the age of 15, he needs extremely serious help.  Knowing what he does is wrong and that he will face punishment for doing it is not a deterrent, which will encourage him to just get better at hiding it since he feels no guilt. This will make your daughters prime targets since children can be groomed and manipulated or threatened into silence relatively easily.

And he should take measures to protect you, like limiting his son's use of his phone (what if those pictures had been shown to his friends or ended up online?) and putting a lock on the bathroom.

DO NOT let him move back in with you, under any circumstances. People are talking about him being in therapy in order to return, as if therapy is some sort of magic wand that will make everything okay. That is just so outrageously wrongheaded when it comes to sexually predatory behavior. The reality is, people with issues like his are really unlikely to change just because they see a therapist. In fact, such behavior tends to escalate unless the individual is *highly* motivated to stop. He needs aggressive intervention, including in-patient treatment.

In the meantime, your duty is to ensure you and your young children are safe, and they are not safe with him living in the home. Neither are you.
