MAYBE he can prove next year that he took this seriously and could move back in if he goes to weekly therapy appointments. But honestly, therapy may not help him enough and I would never trust him again. He is gaslighting you hardcore by moving your underwear around, too.

If he kept rummaging through your underwear AFTER getting caught taking pictures of you getting out of the shower at the age of 15, he needs extremely serious help.  Knowing what he does is wrong and that he will face punishment for doing it is not a deterrent, which will encourage him to just get better at hiding it since he feels no guilt.

In the meantime, your duty is to ensure you and your young children are safe, and they are not safe with him living in the home. Neither are you.

While you don\u2019t need to disconnect completely, having him in your home is too much.", "NTA, he hasn't gone to therapy and hasn't shown anything to knowledge what he has done.\n\nIt isn't safe for you or your daughters to have him living in the household until he has been assessed by experts, yes several, not just one and has attended some major therapy.", "NTA\n\nStepson wouldn't be returning before intense counseling happened. It's not just YOU that needs peace if mind. You've got other kids. \n\nHe's not a homeless, lost street urchin, he has a whole other biological parent that's shirked years of responsibility. Time to step up, Buttercup, your son needs therapy & nurturing.", "NTA. What your step son did is a crime. This is the kind of thing that can escalate very quickly. Please protect yourself and your children. \n\nIf you do decide to let him move back in, your husband needs to realise how bad his sons actions were, and set boundaries accordingly. Therapy is a good first step, but you two also need to agree on what you will do if he invades your privacy again. A united front is important", "NTA what you stepson did was totally creepy and illegal. For your safety dont let him back into the home. If your husband insists he comes back I suggest moving out", "NTA and I completely disagree with the people saying he should come back after therapy. This isn\u2019t something that a few rounds of therapy will fix. He broke your trust repeatedly and I doubt you\u2019ll feel safe around him again. More important, you have little children in the house. Your main job is to protect them. Bringing a sexual predator into the house is not protecting them. I would never let him return. Good luck.", "You are definitely NTA. If he were to be back in the same house as you he would know security would be tight so whose to say hidden cameras don\u2019t get set up and whatever else. You could never feel at ease. He would have to submit to parental controls on everything and full password disclosure. God knows where he got this weird idea from (unfortunately it feels a bit like some twisted porn site which means it\u2019s likely to have gotten worse since). He really should stay at his mothers. The fact he is acting like nothing happened makes it sound a little like he has some kind of disorder and if this is not addressed asap it will only continue to fester and grow. I don\u2019t know the law where you are but I think if that was reported to the police here in the U.K. a 16 year old can be charged with sexual misconduct (although not named) so what he did would be a crime and on his record. You have other vulnerable people than just yourself to think about too and you cannot take the risk. He should have been told the first time it was either the therapists office or the police station if we are being honest. I know in the moment it must have been terrible and very hard to think straight but my concern is that his father failed him by not taking the hard line at that point. As a victim of assault at a young age I can tell you that while I am a well adjusted adult it carried over into the rest of my life far more than I realised at the time and it is only with maturity I have gained the insight into the damage it does. There should be no way he was allowed to simply move to his mums because there is no way to know if there was anything else he was doing as this was not addressed I assume. It\u2019s terrifying that he is acting like it didn\u2019t happen, like he is devoid of shame or guilt. Those are two things liked to sociopaths among many other issues and he needs help.\nYou cannot allow him back into your home with others at risk in good conscience. Your gut is telling you that already and it js not you that should feel guilty.", "NTA. Nope nope nope. No way. Keep him out of your house. He\u2019s an unconvicted sex offender. You have 3 minor children living at home. The risk is too high. He still needs therapy, but he can get that at his mother\u2019s. He\u2019s getting off with minimal consequences. Remind him of that.", "Stepson should extend his stay with biomom & attend therapy FT.  He cannot return until he admits he's been acting as a predator, is open, honest & transparent, & reveals other activities, such as going through dresser drawers & why & what etc.  He cannot return to the house until he reveals if he has a sexual fixation or is selling pics & undies or ...  with the breastfeeding, that's only enabling him, especially with sisters too.", "NTA\n\nHe should have been in therapy all these past months, and his mom should know why. Therapy should be required before he ever moves back in.", "NTA, i would straight up tell him he lost his chance when he denied doing therapy and you don't feel comfortable with him in the same house you and your daughters are in.", "NTA- That is some creepy sht but he's a teenage boys they go thru weird stages where seeing someone naked arouses them. Make therapy a mandatory condition of coming back. In all honesty he's probably just a horny teen and technically his your not his mom so he probably found you attractive. He definitely needs therapy before he does something even crazier. He's going thru puberty boys and is confused. Im not making excuses for that creepy sht but there is probably a underlining reason for it and he's ashamed of it which is why he doesn't want to go to therapy but make it MANDATORY", "NTA. I would never want to be in the same room with my abuser who assaulted me, let alone live in a small house with him. Just no!!!! You were the victim of SA and your abuser is trying to come back to your life. Put your foot down and say no.\n\nHe can and should go into therapy but that doesn\u2019t mean he can then gain access to you and your kids just because he\u2019s \u00ab\u00a0getting help\u00a0\u00bb now. He should have gotten it while he was away. The fact that he didn\u2019t is telling.", "NTA. You, a grown woman are rightfully uncomfortable with him. He clearly has an issue. I wouldn\u2019t let him come back because I\u2019d be concerned about my daughters\u2019 safety. This isn\u2019t \u201cwe had a fight\u201d, this is a much more serious issue that he\u2019s refused to address.", "Look. When I was in my late teens, the cousin who was living with us, who was in his early teens, started stealing my underwear. I told my parents, who kind of blew it off. Fifteen years later, we discover that he had also been sexually abusing a five-year-old girl during this period. \n\nI'm not saying your stepson has abused anyone, but I would strongly recommend you sit down with your kids and ask them about it. Talk to their pediatrician about the right way to do that. Make sure this problem isn't more serious than you know. \n\nI wouldn't have him living in the same house as small children, I'm sorry. You're an adult and arguably can protect yourself, but they can't.", "He\u2019s a kid. Kids do dumb stuff. He has some issues that have to get worked out in therapy, but at the end of the day, he\u2019s still a kid. What kind of message will your \u201creal kids\u201d see if you don\u2019t let him back?  Fuck up and your done to me?  I get it that it sucks, but you can\u2019t abandon a kid at a time that they really need help. My guess it he\u2019s at a big cross road in life and you don\u2019t want him heading down the wrong path. \n\nOn a side note, that\u2019s the problem with all this stupid step mom / sister porn. Of course it fucks with their values. They feel it\u2019s completely normal. Don\u2019t get me started on that stuff.", "You have a young daughter what if your stepson starts pulling weird shit like that with your daughter too? NTA your stepson is a perv and has issues I would feel very unsafe to live with someone like him", "> if your husband can\u2019t agree to that then his stepson can\u2019t come back.\n\nHis actual full biological son, AIUI. That's how he's OP's stepson.", "I never get people who comment, \"this is above reddit's pay grade\" and then immediately spout their opinion.  Like, either judge or don't.  Do play this weird little self effacing game first", "This behaviour also makes me question if he's safe around the little girls.", "That\u2019s not nearly enough not to mention there\u2019s no way to know for sure if he\u2019s actually utilizing it. A lot of people forced into therapy just sit there and don\u2019t say anything or nothing of use anyway. Hell he could be in therapy for months and still never make progress. It\u2019s just too big a risk. If it were me to seriously consider it I\u2019d need a year minimum of therapy on his end and both couples AND family therapy for an extended period of time.", "I\u2019d suggest that maybe you speak with a therapist on your own as well, ask them their professional opinion of actual risk to you, your family or others based on your son\u2019s behaviour. Ask what they would advise, I imagine they will suggest therapy for your son for some time before you move to seeing one another and I doubt they would suggest living together or even doing over nights until the therapist has seen a good change in attitude, progress, etc. This situation has harmed you, harmed your entire family and any maladaptive behaviour which is strongly linked to sex is something which needs treating for the good of everyone around your son, including himself. Hopefully this can be worked through but for his own well-being and safety around others, he needs proper professional treatment and he cannot live with you. I\u2019d also recommend speaking with a lawyer about protection and how this works legally,  in case something happens in the future so that you are prepared for any next steps. \n\n\nI\u2019m glad your husband is taking this as seriously as you are and I agree that therapy be mandatory, regardless of where your son is living. He isn\u2019t well, he needs help and he also needs to see the consequences of his actions. He crossed a very serious line and sadly he needs to recognise that it was entirely his own doing and he has to take steps to change unless he wants that for his future. I wish you and your family luck.", "Let's be honest that this isn't just \"dumb kid stuff\". He didn't arrive home after curfew, got drunk or high, had bad grades. He displayed some very disturbed behavior, to say the least. This is some very fucked up breach of trust. He needs help and guidance, of course, but I wouldn't feel safe with around me either.", "There are two girls in the home. OP needs to ensure their safety. The message she\u2019s sending to her other children is \u2018I\u2019ll always keep you safe no matter how difficult it is\u2019.", "The fact that there are young children in the home jumped out at me too. It\u2019s not just OP\u2019s comfort and safety on the line here, she has her kids to consider. If you move someone in who decided to be a sexual predator towards the stepmom he\u2019s had since preschool, there\u2019s no reason to think anyone else is safe simply by virtue of being a family member. The power dynamic of a teen and much younger siblings would be easier to exploit, too.", "NTAH, Pervs like little boys too. Protect all your children.", "I'm curious about that too... as well as wondering why the boy wants to move back. Is he just homesick, or has he gotten himself into trouble and now he's running again?", "I guess I'll try to help you understand. It was a way to phrase that they need to go see a licensed therapist about the core issue here.", "Yeah, but in typical Redditor (at least AITA) fashion, they are quick to bash the male. Very quick.", "I don\u2019t know. Kick him to the curb at 16 and see how he turns out. I got married for the food and the bad. I made an obligation to raise me kids, not ditch them if they have a mental health issue. \nEveryone is entitled to their own opinion, I just hope to find the food in people.", "Letting her call the shots is a way of dodging responsibility. \"You can't move back; your stepmom says no\". It's his son; he should be firm.", "He also doesn't want to make the son go to therapy, so she's not calling all the shots.", "For what it's worth if there is nothing prevent it you may want to reach out to his mother to find out what's been going on for the past 8 months.", "She isn't kicking him to the curb, though. He's not thrown out to the streets, he's living with his mother.", "That's the exact opposite of what OP said.", "Honestly, I'm generally pro-therapy but I don't think there's a way to \"therapize\" OP into getting her sense of safety back with the stepson in the house. \n\nI'm not going to say the stepson is beyond help, it would be great if he did go to therapy and it helped him get to a healthier place. But therapy is a process, not a magic bullet.", "Yeah I mean legally the dad might not even be able to refuse to have the kid back. He\u2019s technically still a minor.", "NTA, like others, says that therapy is needed to allow him to return, if he can't do the theory, he can't be trusted.", "I see your point but disagree with the sentiment the husband REFUSED to FORCE therapy. There\u2019s a difference between saying here\u2019s an alternative proposed solution that removes the immediate problem for now and absolutely refusing therapy.\n\nRemember, the dad just found out his SON took pictures of his WIFE. Obviously OP is the victim in this situation but Dad just got a huge bomb dropped on him as well. Given the circumstances, it very well might have made the most sense for him to go to his mother\u2019s house especially since the kid was so opposed to therapy.", "You can' force anyone in therapy.\n\nI mean technically you can, but the chances of a positive outcome are greatly reduced.\n\nSome cooperatino is needed from the patient.", "Have you ever tried to force a teenager into therapy? It's like burning money. They sit there and don't talk to the therapist, and then you get a bill anyway. If the son was this troubled and refusing to get help, sending him away was the only option at the time.", "He can he would just have to pay child support"]}
