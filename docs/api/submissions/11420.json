His mom has been completely out of the picture accept for a few phone calls every year. Last year when he was 15 years old he was caught taking pictures of me (without my knowledge) right as I was getting out of the shower, so fully nude. It was really traumatic for me, he denied it completely to me and my husband until we found the pictures in his \u201cdeleted pictures\u201d album. We tried to work threw it as a family, we took his phone away and talked about it, but he continued to do weird shit like rummage through my underwear drawer and denied it every time. I wanted to go to therapy (he, myself and my husband) and set it up and the day before our appointment he broke down crying and said he wouldn\u2019t go and that he\u2019d rather move and go live with his mom (who lives 500 miles away). Being that I never became his legal guardian I couldn\u2019t make him go to therapy And my husband thought it would be good for him to try living with his biological mother for once. So he\u2019s been living with her since the summer (about 8 months). He has now told us he wants to come back to live with us and is honestly acting like nothing happened. My husband pretty much let\u2019s me call the shots however he doesn\u2019t want to make him go to therapy if he does come back and I\u2019m just over here still processing everything and if I\u2019m being honest really don\u2019t want him back in my house. I have a son and two daughters ( all his half siblings). One of my daughters is a baby who I\u2019m still breastfeeding, we live in a very small house and I don\u2019t want to feel like I have to hide ever time I feed her if he does move back. Or really just have all my anxiety around taking a shower return. How do I tell my stepson that he really burned his bridge with me and that I don\u2019t think he should move back in anytime soon?

I\u2019d say the therapy is the **minimum requirement** for stepson to return to the house, and if your husband can\u2019t agree to that then his stepson can\u2019t come back. There\u2019s no papering over this and pretending it never happened. Your stepson needs to do some soul-searching and acknowledge his role in making you uncomfortable to live in the house with him. If he can\u2019t do that, then you shouldn\u2019t let him come back like nothing happened.", "Definitely NTA. I suggest you try therapy with your husband before even considering such a thing. The behavior you described was disturbing at the very least, and the fact that it continued to escalate unchecked by your husband is a huge red flag.", "This is seriously disturbed behavior. I would not have him back under any circumstances, frankly.  And I would get your husband into couples' therapy ASAP, because he doesn't seem to have protected you, does he?\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this, OP. Please take care of yourself. And NTA.", "NTA. You are not safe in his presence.", "NTA. \n\nWanting him in therapy is wise and a hill you should die upon. \n\nDo not let him in your home without having started therapy as an individual and a family. Seeing improvement or understanding of his mental issues should be priority in order to decide if he is allowed back.", "NTA.  He's a perv and obsessed with you.  He could do worse in the future.   I say keep him out.", "NTA. Your stepson is essentially a predator and created an unsafe environment. No is an acceptable answer, and it is alarming that he is pretending like nothing happened.", "NTA. That's very questionable. He needs psychological help to make sure he's not going to do things like that again. Maybe you should let him move in to make sure he gets therapy but that is a risk. The other issue I have is your other daughters. They will need protection from him.", "Actually, don't even let him back unless he is **already** going to therapy. For at least a few months. Make sure the bio-mother knows the reason. Hopefully she can also see the gravity of the situation, and act accordingly.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nmy jaw dropped while reading this story. I completely understand why you don't want to live with him.\n\nbut if he does move back in. make sure he goes to therapy.", "NTA - This is really disturbing and you should not let him back in the house even if he\u2019s in therapy. You have daughters that you need to protect in addition to protecting yourself. Your stepson sounds like he\u2019s on the way to being a sex offender.", "Do not let him back until he has completed at LEAST a couple weeks of therapy for the safety of you & your daughters. It wasn\u2019t my step son but I have had a roommate who had a boyfriend & said boyfriend had a son who would take photos of me fully clothed. They just said he was just being a teenager & not to think into it too much. I woke up to him assaulting me.\n & I read a previous comment that said \u201cwanting him in therapy is wise & is a hill you should die on\u201d & I could not agree more. Please think of the safety of yourself & your other children. This is very concerning behavior", "NTA\n\nHe has to go to therapy FIRST then MAYBE he can move back.\n\nTell your husband to grow a spine.", "OP as Marpole1102 pointed out, this boy is a predator, and you need to unfortunately bypass his dad based upon your statements and you need a protective order against him because he sounds on the verge of stalking you if he's taking nude pictures of you and going through your underwear drawer.  He doesn't need back in your house, and I don't know how you could feel safe with him there, therapy or not, because if he was a stranger or another relative you wouldn't want him there so why would you accept your stepson?\n\nIf he's this obsessive about you sexually, you don't know his potential feelings about the other children in the house either.  Too many parents have tried to sweep this behavior under the rug thinking that therapy will work it out of the him while they continue living in the home (many news worthy examples are out there).  You need to protect yourself and your children.  This is a boundary your husband needs to be with you on.", "NTA\nThis is seriously disturbing and he needs to be in therapy. If he did this to you while you were his mother figure, I would wonder if he would start doing the same thing to your daughters.", "NTA. Under no conditions would I allow him to return. Something is clearly seriously wrong with him and until he seeks therapy willingly, I would not allow him near his siblings. Your husband can and should arrange to see him but should absolutely draw the line at him living in your home again.", "NTA. Neither you nor your daughters would be safe with him in the home.", "NTA. He can come back if he starts therapy and shows behavior adjustments. Until then, I would not trust this budding sex offender in my home if I were you.", "Nta as other have said the co dition to allowing him back would be therapy a  must if he can't do theory he can't be trusted", "NTA.  Move in anytime soon??  I'd  say never", "Nta. Your husband is. He should have forced therapy. The answer is...I deserve to feel safe in my own home. I do not feel safe with him here.", "Nta\n\nI'm so sorry you were violated in your own home. \n\nI wouldn't even give it another thought until you and your husband have therapy together and his son gets counseling as well.\n\nNo one should be that anxious in their own home and have the person who violated their privacy be so flippant about it as well.", "I have seen too many true crime documentaries to ever be okay with him moving back in. He sounds like he has antisocial personality tendencies. Absolutely not. You deserve to feel safe in your own home. And you don\u2019t sound worried enough about your little kids. They may be his half-siblings, but his judgement is not there. \n\nHe needs to be in therapy and he needs to stay with his mom. He doesn\u2019t get to decide that it\u2019s fine he violated you and he can come back now. Even insisting if he moves in he gets therapy is not enough. MAYBE he can prove next year that he took this seriously and could move back in if he goes to weekly therapy appointments. But honestly, therapy may not help him enough and I would never trust him again. He is gaslighting you hardcore by moving your underwear around, too. (In addition to saying he didn\u2019t take pictures and acting like it didn\u2019t happen). \n\nYou already know in your gut that he shouldn\u2019t move back in. Stick to it.", "YWBTA if you tell him that, though I totally understand why you want to!  I think a far better solution would be offer to do online family therapy once a week exploring his behavior and how to fix it and then revisit coming home.  He probably will not take that deal, but then he's not being rejected by the only parents he actually knew.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My question is why is he wanting to leave his mother's house? Was he taking pictures there too?", "That is sexually predatory behavior, as you obviously realize. Were it just you and your husband, I'd say maybe give him a chance with a mountain of therapy, but I don't think there's enough therapy in the entire world that would make me feel comfortable putting him around my small daughters. If he kept rummaging through your underwear AFTER getting caught taking pictures of you getting out of the shower at the age of 15, he needs extremely serious help.  Knowing what he does is wrong and that he will face punishment for doing it is not a deterrent, which will encourage him to just get better at hiding it since he feels no guilt. This will make your daughters prime targets since children can be groomed and manipulated or threatened into silence relatively easily. Breaking down crying and denying therapy makes me wonder if there's worse things he'd have to admit to that you don't know about yet. Honestly, only bad things can come of letting him around your children, let alone you.  NTA", "NTA he\u2019s a sexual predator. His age is of no matter here only what he has apparently Zero qualms doing.\n\nI would Never knowingly let one of those into my life much less my home.", "Yes yes yes!

Its traumatic ngl.", "Agreed. This behavior is terrible, and unless properly addressed, will only get worse. Therapy is a definite must.\n\nNTA.", "It was a lot to write but it didn\u2019t really go unchecked by my husband. My husband didn\u2019t  just ignore it.
