He doesn\u2019t get to decide that it\u2019s fine he violated you and he can come back now. Even insisting if he moves in he gets therapy is not enough. MAYBE he can prove next year that he took this seriously and could move back in if he goes to weekly therapy appointments. But honestly, therapy may not help him enough and I would never trust him again. He is gaslighting you hardcore by moving your underwear around, too.

If he kept rummaging through your underwear AFTER getting caught taking pictures of you getting out of the shower at the age of 15, he needs extremely serious help.  Knowing what he does is wrong and that he will face punishment for doing it is not a deterrent, which will encourage him to just get better at hiding it since he feels no guilt.

In the meantime, your duty is to ensure you and your young children are safe, and they are not safe with him living in the home. Neither are you.

He may go to therapy but he will just minimize his actions and portray them as no big deal and likely continue them at home when he thinks he can get away with it.", "NTA. He needs therapy regardless. Your husband should tell him he can't come back.", "NTA\nHe\u2019s a burgeoning sexual predator.\nIf you choose to allow him ti come back, make therapy a precondition.  He needs to see a professional before he escalates.", "NTA. He\u2019s been watching too much porn", "Nta. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe in the house due to his past behavior and he never went to therapy to discuss his actions and thoughts. Plus you have a baby And breastfeeding so i worry he might want to watch you doing those things as well", "NTA. I wouldn't allow him back under any circumstances. He is a child but he is also a sexual predator and MORE than old enough to understand what he was doing was wrong before he did it. If it were my SS, he'd be dead to me and my children.", "Uhh no. nope. nope. Don't let predators in your house. He should go to therapy and he can go to therapy at his mom's house. \n\nSay no and stick to no. I'd straight up get a divorce before I let him back in my house, especially with small children. NTA.\n\nTherapy is NOT a magic wand. What he did, multiple times, is deeply wrong and deeply scary. He would need to be in therapy for at least a year and the therapist would need to be part of this but I'd just say no.", "Your stepson is displaying sexually predatory behavior, and I don't blame you for being uncomfortable inviting him back into the home.\n\nHe absolutely needs some therapy, but the extra kids at the house would get a solid \"no\" from me. Putting up with the skeevy behavior yourself is already something you shouldn't have to consider, but inviting that kind of evil into your kids life is an absolute non-starter. NTA.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t just burn his bridge, he nuked it. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine letting someone back into my home with my children and myself at risk, with, or without therapy. While taking pictures of you doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he would do so with the kids, it certainly doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t. I mean, you\u2019ve been his mom for 7 years\u2026.nope. No. \n\nHe definitely needs therapy, immediately. Don\u2019t allow it to be played off as some sort of \u201cprank.\u201d This is unforgivable, and any 15yo knows that.", "NTA \n\nThe disturbed teen coming back is like inviting your stalker to move back in. He has a very unhealthy obsession with OP that will only escalate no matter what therapy he gets or promises he makes. He\u2019s very creepy and would create an unsafe environment for the family", "NTA.  You and your daughters need to feel and be safe in your own home and I don't think that will happen if he moves back.  You are definitely NTA for not wanting him to return.", "NTA - another human took violating pics of you and hasn\u2019t shown remorse. The SS has no idea what that means it seems. How do you know he won\u2019t do it again? How would he like his privacy violated like that. No therapy and no remorse means a hell no to bringing him back into your safe place.", "NTA\n\nIMO he needs to start therapy now, and then when you are finished with breastfeeding, and if he sticks with the therapy during that time frame, then I would possibly consider it.\n\nMy initial reaction was going to be that the therapy would not make a difference, and not to let him back in the house with you.  But if he is willing to start the therapy and stick with it for at least 6 months (probably longer), then that might show that he is making some progress.  But there really isn't any way to prove either way if the therapy had any effect on him or not.\n\nThere is so much \"step\" porn out there that seems to make this type of behavior acceptable, and that may be what initially triggered this type of behavior in your step son.\n\nUltimately you are the one that needs to feel safe in your own home, and if you believe that therapy for him, and also for you will get you to the point that you can feel safe with your step son in the same house, then its a possibility.  Even if he finishes therapy and a couple of years have gone by while he is in therapy, and you still do not feel safe around him, then do not feel bad about not letting him back into your house.", "NTA- The risk is too high. Therapy yes, a million times yes, but I'm afraid it's also partially on you to protect other people from his behaviour, especially as that kind of thing is prone to escalating. That means making sure he faces full consequences every time he does it. No bailing him out, no arguing on his behalf to school or college authorities, no sugar coating- if he gets caught doing this to another woman he will end up on a register and his life will be ruined. He has to be point blank told what he has done makes him a sexual offender already, and you'll wash your hands of him entirely if he commits another such crime.", "NTA - It's *his* son, he should be the one handling all of this. The fact it's even being negotiated like the Son isn't a predator. therapy should be the minimum WHILE living with his mom - who should also know what he's done. \n\nYou shouldn't be the one forced to even consider letting him back into the house.", "NTA\n\nAfter what he did I wouldn't want him back either, you deserve to feel comfortable in your own home and I can't imagine there is anyway you will now if he is there, especially during breast feeding.\n\nAs an absolute minimum he needs to be in therapy first, but you are well within your rights to just outright say no.", "NTA and I'd be shit scared he's escalated and been inappropriate with your other daughter. I don't think I could ever trust him again around my family. He's with his mom, he should stay there.", "You're most definitely NTA and you should be EXTREMELY concerned that your husband is making excuses for why he doesn't want his son to get therapy / psychiatric treatment. You have two AHs here and your husband is a giant one. Also it's not safe for your stepson to come back at all, but that kid needs therapy regardless. Your husband has dropped the ball big time.", "You have to protect your other kids. You should absolutely not let him live there, therapy or not. NTA", "Sorry, but you would be terribly irresponsible if you allow your stepson to come back \u2014 to the point where, if it\u2019s a sticking point for your husband, you need to prioritize your other kids and potentially leave. \n\n>he was caught taking pictures of me (without my knowledge) right as I was getting out of the shower, so fully nude.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a small matter and it goes beyond \u201cburning bridges.\u201d Your stepson sounds like he\u2019s well on his way towards becoming a full blown predator, if he hasn\u2019t crossed the line already. The fact that he resisted (and was allowed to resist) therapy when he did something so egregious, his refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing, and the lack of an apology all indicates to me that he\u2019s not a safe person to be around without extensive treatment. He violated you in your own home, which is terrible in itself but, moreover:\n\n>I have a son and **two daughters** ( all his half siblings)\n\nRegardless of whether or not one of your girls is a baby, you should NOT expose either one to a nearly adult male who behaves in sexually predatory ways. Like, no. You would be risking their wellbeing and that would not be acceptable. If your husband doesn\u2019t see why his son cannot return before seriously progressing through psychological counseling, he\u2019s a problem, too. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nLook, you've basically raised this kid and been the mother figure since he was five. Yet he still did all this super creepy shit.\n\nI wouldn't let him back in the house, especially with young kids. The normal 'family' boundary line that exists for people appears to be absent. \n\nIt would still be creepy, wrong, and disgusting, but to pull this on you just triples the ick factor.", "I'm shocked that he isn't in therapy even at his bio moms place. \n\nThat kid really needs help, and if hes engaging in predatory behavior this young, he really needs a major intervention.\n\nDoes Bio-mom know what happened?", "From what I have seen (including myself) the husband bashers have your best interest at heart.", "You didn\u2019t read the post right. His father is not against therapy. You have no idea who is mother is. And believe me if we could afford boarding school I would not be asking this question on Reddit. I guess \u201cAITA\u201d really brings out assholes", "Yeah your husband wants to make him go to therapy, but leaving the ultimate decision up to you is kind of a cop out on his part. It makes you be the bad guy here for not letting step son move back in. Maybe your husband has problems with confronting his son about this behavior, but he needs to step up and say to his son that he can\u2019t move back in yet because of his actions.", "So his son did gross pervert things and you get to be the bad guy? \n\nWTF...", "Clap clap clap \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f"]}
