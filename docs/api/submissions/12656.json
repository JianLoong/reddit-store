When I made my way to the break room I looked in the fridge and saw the lunchbox was not there. I asked around to my co workers in the room if they have seen my daughters lunch box.

I don\u2019t engage with her unless we are ordered to do projects together which has been 3 times (one last month) \n\nI found Kelly at her work desk, neck deep in my daughters lunch box. I asked K why she thought it was appropriate to eat out of someone lunch that was not hers. She said she assumed it was one of the younger interns lunch boxes because they are into Sanrio. She then sheepishly admitted she didn\u2019t know my name so she ignored my sticky note looked through the lunchbox and thought the food fit her carvings well( sandwich, yogurt, kimchi, and fruits). She said the lunch served by the company was too overwhelming (chicken with various sides and salads were offered that day).\n\nA co worker of mine Mary, heard our altercation and immediately got someone from HR. A lot of people in the office are praising me for finally catching her in the act and possibly her getting fired. The older people in the office said I should have let it go but she cost my daughter almost being hungry (I went and dropped off some McDonald\u2019s unfortunately) and she showed no remorse.\n\nShe texted in the work groupchat saying one mother to another I should drop the HR report on Monday so she wouldn\u2019t get fired.
