I did not grow up with many female remodels, i.e. I did not grow up wearing or learning how to wear makeup. I also consider myself bad at femininity when it comes to keeping up with things like shaving, doing my hair, etc. I'm more of a roll out of bed, spend 15 minutes getting ready and then take on the day kind of gal. Don't get me wrong, I dress up for work, and I dress up on special occasions, but I don't tend to take the time to straighten my hair and put on makeup. Well, about a year ago my BF and I started dating. I know from his past GF's that he is used to a girl who wears a full face of makeup on the regular. For me, I see makeup as more of something to use to try to cover up flaws, or change the way you look because you don't like it or something. And maybe that's where the issue lies. But he has mentioned multiple times now, and even gotten a little argumentative about me not wanting to try to wear more makeup and dress up more and be more of a girly girl. It has come to the point where I feel like he doesn't like me as I am and wants to change me into something I am not really comfortable with. Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1704732278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191phvp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wear_makeup/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you\u2019re not someone who likes to wear makeup, then there\u2019s conversation beyond that. He cannot change who you are or what you look like. If he prefers someone who wears makeup, then he needs to find that person, not force you to become that person. The qualities of \u201cfemininity\u201d that you reference are all societal standards that come from men\u2019s attempt to control women. It\u2019s perfectly fine to enjoy using makeup or dressing up, but it does not make you any more or less of a woman.", "NTA. If he can't appreciate the natural you, that's his failing.  If he can't understand he's not good enough for you.", "NTA - while I'd argue that you can wear makeup for more reasons than you've mentioned (like, if you're into it, it can be great for self-expression or just plain old creativity), that's not the point, and the real point is that it's ultimately *your* choice whether you wear makeup or not.\n\nLike, if he was encouraging you to explore different forms of presentation, that would be fine. But if he wants you to meet certain presentation standards that just aren't yours, maybe he should be looking for someone else? (I'm not saying you should break up, but it's certainly not your job to present in some femme style just because he wants it)", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with women not wearing makeup. Presumably were this way when you met, so if he wanted to date someone who wears makeup all the time, he shouldn't have pursued anything with you. It's concerning not just that he is trying to change you, but that he's argumentative about it. Huge red flag. Out of curiosity, has he tried to change/control you in other ways?", "NTA. You don\u2019t enter a relationship to try and change the person you committed to.

Until \u2026 this guy? \n\nYou don\u2019t have to keep your BF. You can set him free to go find somebody that is more in line with what *he* thinks his GF should be like. \n\nOr you can put up with him arguing with you about what you look like,  and how he sees it as being lacking, for the foreseeable forever. NTA", "NTA, your intuition is correct here I think. He doesn't care about your comfort or preference or experience, he wants you to doll up for him. It's up to you how far you want to go and to communicate with him why does he want that - if he isn't attracted to how you are, why did he got into a relationship with you? What would be a comfortable compromise for you both - waxing every 4 weeks, hair dresser every two weeks, make up when you are going out in the evening together? Is he willing to pay for all of that? Are you willing to put the time for it?", "NTA - though I disagree with you that makeup is just for covering flaws, etc. I absolutely support you wearing or not wearing any makeup.

This man does **NOT** love you for who you are, who you'll become or who **YOU** want to be. ***A real  man*** would **accept** you no matter what, tell you that you don't need makeup, he loves you just the same and nothing will ever make you look more beautiful than your own natural beauty.\n\nLeave this man in the dust because You should not be pressured into it anything by anyone, as it's your life and not theirs. Personal hygiene vs the use of makeup are two different things entirely.

I\u2019m sure that translates to lots of good things about you: honesty, self-acceptance, a relaxed attitude toward the mess of life and aging, lack of pretense. I\u2019m assuming, but I think those are all great qualities. You deserve a man who isn\u2019t trying to make you into something else, and who appreciates all this about you. What a great role model YOU will be for other women and girls. Stay yourself. Consider finding a different guy.

I rub my eyes and would be unaware of the mess for half a day. It feels really viscerally weird to augment my face and carry something glued on top of it.

I did not grow up with many female remodels, i.e. I did not grow up wearing or learning how to wear makeup. I also consider myself bad at femininity when it comes to keeping up with things like shaving, doing my hair, etc. I'm more of a roll out of bed, spend 15 minutes getting ready and then take on the day kind of gal. Don't get me wrong, I dress up for work, and I dress up on special occasions, but I don't tend to take the time to straighten my hair and put on makeup. Well, about a year ago my BF and I started dating. I know from his past GF's that he is used to a girl who wears a full face of makeup on the regular. For me, I see makeup as more of something to use to try to cover up flaws, or change the way you look because you don't like it or something. And maybe that's where the issue lies. But he has mentioned multiple times now, and even gotten a little argumentative about me not wanting to try to wear more makeup and dress up more and be more of a girly girl. It has come to the point where I feel like he doesn't like me as I am and wants to change me into something I am not really comfortable with. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not everyone is you and enjoys being to how to fix themselves up, how to dress, how to act, how to look because we've been told how to do this for to damn long.
