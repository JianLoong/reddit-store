He was friends with my ex, and two days after we broke up, he asked me on a date. We immediately clicked and started dating since. \n\nBut, he's been struggling financially, and since I had a little more stability, I started helping him with what I could. I bought food for him in our first date, I payed for the Uber, and that sort of stuff. A week later he got sick and I payed medicine for him. He then told me he was going in a competition in the end of the year, so I payed the training classes for him. I started helping him with everything, to the point where I started struggling financially. Even though I know he only asks for help for import things, like food and medicine, I started getting frustrated because he wouldn't take extra work to earn more money and would spend his money in superficial things, like tickets to a park that we couldn't afford and I had to pay for his food and drinks. \n\nBesides that, he wouldn't show actual interest in me. He wouldn't ask about my life, my career, my interests, nothing. I questioned if he was with me just because of my help, and he denied it, saying that he liked me because of who I was. But he knows nothing about me, so how could it be? \n\nI told him I was getting mad with this situation, and everytime he would ask for more money, he said he was going to pay me back (wich he didn't), or was already sending money (never did). Yesterday we fought because of this, and he said he was never going to ask me for nothing again (then asked me for the only 6$ I had left, to buy a dress for his mom and a belt for him). I kind feel bad for denying money even though I know he really needs it, but I need it too, and he doesn't help me at all with my bills. Would I be the asshole to break up with him for this, and possibly losing a good relationship over money?\n\nEDIT: he and my ex ended the friendship one year before I broke up with him because he was a very arrogant and ignorant person. I ended the relationship with my ex for 7 months ago, then I found out one month ago he cheated the whole time and 2 days later after I blocked him on everything that I actually went out with my boyfriend now.", "created_utc": 1698502004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ieips/aita_for_denying_me_boyfriend_money/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA\n\nSo homeboy dates his friends ex immediately after they break up, learns nothing about you, and just starts mooching money off of you. And you have to ask who the asshole is? It's him. Drop his ass and teach him a lesson about how to treat people, he clearly needs it", "Money make some people act crazy so Keep this saying in mind: \n\n\"If you give too much to soon then the person will fall in love with your hand not your heart.\"", "Nta- he\u2019s a mooch or a leach\u2026 drains his victims and will move on once he can no longer take from you. Make it easy and ghost this fool!  Cut your losses now and chalk up the loss of investment as learned mistake!", "This isn\u2019t a good relationship, he doesn\u2019t need your money, he wants it. He\u2019s spending his on stuff he doesn\u2019t need and then asks you for money when he runs out.. his mom can buy her own dress and he can save for a belt. Get out of there before you\u2019re poor and asking someone else for money", "He's taking advantage of you. NTA.", "You don't have a boyfriend. You have am aggressive leech who pounced the minute he heard you broke up.\n\nThis part is him not you- he wasn't interested in you because he thinks you're a great person, he was interested in you because you were vulnerable after a hard break up and he thought it would be easy to \"hook\" you. \n\nBreak up. Immediately. No other answer.", "Sounds like a woman I know who thought the homeless guy sleeping on her couch was her boyfriend. This is a totally one sided relationship.", "I got to that line and wondered if I had been paying more attention to what was written than the actual author did\u2026\n\nOP - this is not what a \u201cgood relationship\u201d looks like, and frankly - it\u2019s concerning that you think it is. You\u2019ve been together for a month, you should be in the brand new shiny stage. You know, the first few months were you try to show your best self to your new Romantic partner. Either he doesn\u2019t care enough or can show you his best self, or you\u2019re already getting his best self. Either way, especially after just a month, you have been given any reason to think that your relationship is ever going to be different from the way it is now. He isn\u2019t showing you, your money or your relationship any respect. \n\nYou would NTA if you break it off, you\u2019d be an AH to yourself if you carried on dating this person. \n\nEnd it now before you get into any serious, life altering financial trouble because of him. And maybe think about how and why you find it so hard to say no to things that are so obviously detrimental to your wellbeing, so you never end up in a similar toxic dynamic.", "There's so much more to a good relationship than \"doesn't hit me\" or \"didn't cheat on me.\" Relationships should be partnerships.  I'm not seeing what he's bringing to this one.", "IKR. What sort of good relationship bankrupts you to just $6 to your name in the span of one month? \n\nNTA. But please break up with this guy. He sounds like trouble. He\u2019s an adult who can take care of his own financial issues. You\u2019re not an ATM.", "Agreed. NTA.", "He's in a relationship with your bank account, not you.", "I think she meant the 4 year friendship.", "Right, I couldn't possibly imagine myself asking a partner for money after only a month of knowing them. I'm still on that \"I pay for everything early on in a relationship even though I can't afford it\" grind.\n\nHell my ex gf, who I dated for 8 years, tries to buy me things I need or give me money to help me out and I still refuse.", "This. NTA, OP. And if this continues and you move him in, he may do like my ex and make you financially responsible for EVERYTHING. The get truly abusive once you run out of money and credit. Dump him now.", "Yea I just can\u2019t agree with the NTA judgements.\n\nThe BF is definitely the much bigger asshole but OP also sucks quite a bit.", "Second paragraph says it all.", ">Yta for thinking this is a good relationship\n\nThese kind of votes don't make sense. I get the sentiment of \"why are you doing this to yourself\", but the vote counts towards a judgment that she is *The* only asshole in the situation.\n\nHow is she an *asshole*? She's misguided and hoping that something that isn't there is there. Being a fool in search of love that isn't there isn't asshole behavior.", "HAHAHAHHAA they stopped talking because he didn't like the way my ex treated me, and my ex cheated on me so it's good", "he cheated on me and they were not friend anymore", "Their friendship ended while I was still with my ex because he didn't like the way he acted in general and how he treated me. We live in a very very small town where everyone gets with exes from our friends because there's not a lot of people in here, so it's common. I don't have contact with my ex so I don't know how he feels about it or even if he know we're together", "I think she is being an AH to herself here. It seems as if she's learned nothing from the previous bad relationship.", "It's *not* good, though. He might not have cheated on you, but he's no better than your ex was.", "And this guy is treating you just as poorly! (and I guarantee he will cheat on you too). Wake up, and stop being a doormat!", "literally *nothing* about what you've typed here sounds anywhere close to 'good'.", "But he's a leech! Come on, you are better off alone then with this loser."]}
