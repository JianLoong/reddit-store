He was friends with my ex, and two days after we broke up, he asked me on a date. We immediately clicked and started dating since. \n\nBut, he's been struggling financially, and since I had a little more stability, I started helping him with what I could. I bought food for him in our first date, I payed for the Uber, and that sort of stuff. A week later he got sick and I payed medicine for him. He then told me he was going in a competition in the end of the year, so I payed the training classes for him. I started helping him with everything, to the point where I started struggling financially. Even though I know he only asks for help for import things, like food and medicine, I started getting frustrated because he wouldn't take extra work to earn more money and would spend his money in superficial things, like tickets to a park that we couldn't afford and I had to pay for his food and drinks. \n\nBesides that, he wouldn't show actual interest in me. He wouldn't ask about my life, my career, my interests, nothing. I questioned if he was with me just because of my help, and he denied it, saying that he liked me because of who I was. But he knows nothing about me, so how could it be? \n\nI told him I was getting mad with this situation, and everytime he would ask for more money, he said he was going to pay me back (wich he didn't), or was already sending money (never did). Yesterday we fought because of this, and he said he was never going to ask me for nothing again (then asked me for the only 6$ I had left, to buy a dress for his mom and a belt for him). I kind feel bad for denying money even though I know he really needs it, but I need it too, and he doesn't help me at all with my bills. Would I be the asshole to break up with him for this, and possibly losing a good relationship over money?\n\nEDIT: he and my ex ended the friendship one year before I broke up with him because he was a very arrogant and ignorant person. I ended the relationship with my ex for 7 months ago, then I found out one month ago he cheated the whole time and 2 days later after I blocked him on everything that I actually went out with my boyfriend now.", "created_utc": 1698502004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ieips/aita_for_denying_me_boyfriend_money/", "score": 263, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
