The  boyfriend NEVER has Angela stay at his place because he \"values his  privacy\". I'm kind of a pushover at times, so I didn't mind that Karl  and Alex would occasionally come over to the house on weekends, and stay  the night on Saturdays.\n\nUnfortunately,  this became a routine and now I get a lot of pushback whenever I want a  weekend to myself. But the main issue that has come up regards the TV. I  have a TV in the living room, and next to it is the kitchen and  \"hang-out\" area. The problem is, Alex's parents are quite strict  regarding his use of any screens (Karl is divorced but coparents). In  fact, the school they send Alex to is a Waldorf school, and the school  actually made parents sign a pledge that they will not allow the child  to have any screen time (phones, iPads, TVs).\n\nI  don't actually watch TV that much, but when I do, it's usually not  kid-appropriate stuff. Nothing outrageous, but think of things like Last  of Us (violence) or Bill Maher (swearing, sexual talk). Because Alex  doesn't get a chance to see many screens, he is drawn to the TV like a  moth to flame. If Angela and Karl are chatting in the hang-out area and  Alex is with them, as soon as he hears the TV, he'll come into the  living room and stare at the screen. Karl or Angela will realize he's  missing after a few minutes, come into the living room, and give me a  nasty glare as they a protesting Alex away. Also, Alex's dad then yells at him, telling Alex that he knows he is not allowed to watch TV, which makes me feel bad for the kid.\n\nNot too long ago, Angela  approached me when we were alone to ask me to please me more aware of  what kind of content I was exposing Alex to. She said it made her  boyfriend Karl quite upset, and she wanted to keep him calm (he has  quite a temper). I reluctantly agreed, and the next time they were over,  I switched over to watching MASH, which I enjoy, even though it isn't  what I really wanted to be watching. I guess that wasn't good enough for  Karl, because he has now asked Angela to tell me he'd prefer I not  watch TV when his kid is visiting, because no matter the content, Karl doesn't want Alex exposed to screens.\n\nI  put my foot down and said no, it's my house (I own the house, Angela  rents a room), and I should be able to use my TV and living room. I feel taken advantage of, and now am refusing to even change the channel to more appropriate content when Alex is around. Angela called me an AH and said it was only for one or two days a week, and I could  always watch upstairs on my computer. AITA for not just turning off the TV when Alex is there?\n\nWhy I think I might be the asshole: I keep getting Alex in trouble by watching TV, and am perhaps exposing him to inappropriate content. I think I might be the asshole because I could watch TV at a different time, or upstairs on my laptop.", "created_utc": 1680623621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bna8l/aita_for_not_turning_off_the_tv_when_a_child_is/", "score": 504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
