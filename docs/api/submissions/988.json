{"id": 988, "submission_id": "ykozih", "title": "AITA for reporting my coworker who was selling her medication?", "selftext": "I (22F) just recently started my job working with foster homes about a month ago. I had a coworker (27F), we'll call her Ellen. Ellen was incredibly open about her personal life. She would talk about sex capades, her bodily issues, etc. Well, I was  in the car with E, and she stated she had a secret. When I did not push the issue, she egged me on to ask, and so I did.  She disclosed to me that she is selling her ADHD medication, Adderall, for $10 a pill, making $600 a month from it. She claims that she sells it to one adult (who is apparently taking a cocktail of other drugs). She asked me not to tell anyone. Well,  I reported it to our boss as it's y'know, illegal, and it worried me since she works with foster kids and families. I worried about our firm as well, if something like this got out. She was fired for it today (as well as 2 years of tardiness, speaking ill of coworkers, etc). \n\nI called my mother yesterday, in hopes for advice if I did the right or wrong thing. My mom wasn't exactly a fan of what I did, calling me a narc. She stated that I have potentially ruined her life, and that it was none of my business. I don't have enough life experience to know what's going on, and may have financially ruined her (Ellen ordered DoorDash 1-2x a workday, and binges alcohol, so it's presumed that's where a decent chunk of money goes). Both my parents are potheads, my sister and brother have both at one time sold and/or did drugs as well. I'm the odd one out, really.  Anyway. So she just wasn't a fan. My sister stated she understood why, but that she would not have personally done it. \n\nSo now it's kind of weighing on me, whether I did the right or wrong thing in this situation. I've never gotten someone fired before, and it's hard to have my family not see it as a good idea or the right decision. My boss assures me that I was right, but it's just weighing on me.

What she\u2019s doing is highly illegal and exposes the entire company to an easily avoidable risk.", "NTA. First off she worked with very vulnerable children, some who likely were removed from their homes for reasons a lot like this. Second,  you're probably a mandated reporter if you work with fosters. \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing. She's an idiot looking to get locked up if she's not careful.", "NTA\n\nShe ratted herself out lol. I understand the foster business my family runs an agency. If she got caught instead of getting fired, a lot worse could have happened to her.", "NTA. If she was selling to clients especially you had a duty to report. It was stupid of her to tell you, a coworker, because when it came out if it came out you knew you would have been fired too. She put you in a lose lose situation. It also sounds like she was on her way out the door anyways with all the tardiness and other issues.", "NTA!  What this friend is doing is illegal!  She is taking meds prescribed for her, then selling them to get distributed to lord knows who else!  She is trafficking drugs, which could land her in prison.  Working with foster kids and their families, she is working with some especially vulnerable kids and a vulnerable society.  She needs to be clean and at the top of her game in order to serve those families.  You did the right thing!  God forbid should one of those kids or families get dragged into her mess of a life.  She was rightly fired, and you did right by your job and those you serve.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin her life, she chose to sell her pills.", "NTA, she volunteered it, and it's definitely illegal. Sounds like she needs help", "NTA.  In fact, you are very likely a mandatory reporter and should have also called children's services.   She would and should be barred from working with kids and foster homes.  Protecting kids doesn't make you a \"narc\" and anyone calling you out is immature and, frankly, foolish for failing to recognize the serious risk that woman posed to children in care.  Good for you!  This woman ruined her own career and life through her own actions.  This is entirely on her.", "NTA and I think you are trying to work on your aggravation with your family's substance uses but in a really positive way. \n\nIf you want to do drugs that's fine but don't force other people to keep your dirty secrets to feel better about your choices.", "NTA, in other circumstances I wouldn't report the coworker.  But under these circumstances it was the right thing to do, and honestly necessary she was always going to get in trouble for this, if it came to light that you knew and said nothing.", "Omg NTA. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. You didn\u2019t report it out of revenge, you reported it out of concern to protect your clients. Good job.", "info\n\nhow does she gets fired on your word alone?  since she should just have denied it since no proof.", "NTA\n\nBy telling you this secret, for no reason, she had effectively made you an accomplice in her illegal activity. It's not like you spied on her and then narced, she just voluntarily told you! She was literally a drug dealer, working with kids! Don't feel bad, she brought all of this on herself.", "Info: how would they be able to prove she was selling it?\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t get fired on your word alone.", "NTA she's selling microdoses of meth ffs", "First off, it IS illegal to sell prescribed medicine of that type to others. \n\nSecond, she worked with a vulnerable population.\n\nThird, she knew the consequences of what could happen if she got caught.  So her egging you on to ask her about her \"secret\" was stupid on her part.  She also would know this even if she didn't egg you on to ask.\n\nYour coworker made extremely poor decisions.  I question how she stayed in the job in the first place as her professional boundaries seem not to exist.\n\nYour family is biased.  You didn't ruin her life.  She did.\n\nNTA", "Your mom was calling you a narc when Ellen straight up is the reason why it's hard for me to get actual medication for my actual disorder. Your mother seems like she was buying from Ellen if I'm entirely honest (jk)\n\nNTA- you really should be filing an actual police report to where they can conduct a proper investigation and have her penalized for committing an actual crime.", "NTA. She isn't \"incredibly open\". What she is is someone with very bad boundaries and poor judgement. I mean very poor. Throw in that she was dealing drugs, and you've got two big red flags indicating she's someone who shouldn't work with the vulnerable. You did the right thing.", "NTA-you work with foster kids, which are a hugely vulnerable population. You absolutely did the right thing and it sounds like coworker wasn\u2019t good at her job anyway.\n\nIf mom pushes, remind her that you did try to mind your business but that coworker forced you to be involved through telling you.", "NTA. You two are not in the type of job where that sort of irresponsibility should be ignored. And I mean that, even if we disregard the drug sales. Confidentiality and professionalism are paramount: her chronic tardiness and gossiping are antithetical to that.", "NTA. She is breaking the law, you did the right thing. I can understand why you're feeling bad because of her financial problems, it's normal to feel that way. I found it strange how she casually mentioned a serious crime she is committing.", "ESH, you for being a narc and her for blabbing her business to a narc.", "I mean, YTA and a narc \u2014 mind your own business next time instead of ruining someone\u2019s life.", "YTA \none: you can't prove it. She only bragged to sell pills, you didn't see it nor did you catch her doing it. \n\nTwo: you have no clue if she is selling to foster kids, selling to foster parents, or just some random, and if she's doing her actual job well, why would you want to punish her?\n\nThree: she never should have told you anything, because quite frankly it really is none of your business.\n\nFour: Unless you could prove shes selling to a minor, im gonna assume that she and her 'client' are consenting adults who are aware of risks and are responsible for themselves. (But this delves into a whole other conversation)\n\nFive: medications are expensive (at least here in the US.) She could be helping someone, you don't know.\n\nIt wasn't your problem, wasn't your business, and wasn't your place to say something based on hearsay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I reported it yesterday morning, and she was fired today. I was in training for when she was fired, but she just stated \u201cok\u201d and quietly packed her things. I\u2019m unsure if they just believed it was something she would do, or if the other discipline issues they\u2019ve had over the last 2 years added up.", "I\u2019m unsure. I was in an all-day training today, so I didn\u2019t get to hear any of the conversations that happened. I just know I reported it yesterday, wrote and signed a statement, and she was fired today.", "I commented elsewhere. It sounds like she's been a problem employee before. They had grounds to fire her but likely hadn't due to staff shortages and/or not wanting to have a confrontation. This is reported. Likely, management believed she was doing it. They don't want it officially documented to make a paper trail. They fire her for other reasons, at least \"officially\".", "Found the tweaker!", "So I guess my thing is: *why* tell me. What does she gain from that? We\u2019ve known each other barely a month, and it was not like I asked her specifically about it.", "nta \n\nit is possible she played you, that she wanted to get fired. getting fired gives you money, quiting does not overall.\n\nConfessing, and insisting on confessing makes sense in that context. Letting you know, hoping you tell the boss.\nThen when confronted deny but offering to accept being fired for an amount off cash plus a agreement not to make accusations off any nature. \n\nYou where not there so do not know how it went down, and confessing to the boss makes no sense since illegal to sell pills.", "I will guess that they fired her, officially, for other issues. They don't want this in any official paperwork if they can help it. It sounds like she's been a problem employee for awhile, and likely was kept on for convenience. No one wanted to have the confrontation with her, and they likely are already short handed. \n\nYou reported this, and my guess is, everyone believed she was doing it. So, it made it worth firing her for the other reasons.", "It's more likely the other issues added up, although the medicine selling may have played a factor. NTA", "That makes it sound like this wasn't the first time they've been caught doing questionable/illegal things. Typically, a single report like yours would start an inquiry, not trigger immediate termination.", "Lol, but nah \u2014 not my thing.", "If I had to guess the fact that she is a heavy drinker and is prescribed medication that's a bad idea to mix with alcohol.\n\nEither she never takes her meds, or she sometimes does.  Eitherway not a good idea.\n\nSo rational behavior might be a bit too much to expect.", "I'm going to guess guilt. She knows it's wrong. She may be bragging to impress you, or hoping you'd give some approval of it. \n\nShe sounds like a mess of a person. I would be careful, because she may try to retaliate against you. \n\nYou did the right thing reporting it to your boss. The best case, they did this as some sort of test to see how trustworthy you are. The worst, is someone gets hurt and it comes back that you knew about it.", "Because she's not sober and it's extremely obvious", "I wouldn't know. Perhaps she thought you two were friends, perhaps you seem approachable, maybe she really wanted to brag. Extremely foolish on her end. So foolish it almost seems like she may even be lying, b/c honestly, telling people your illegal business is no way to run an illegal business.", "I assumed it was due to the other issues - tardiness, giving incorrect information to foster parents, lack of boundaries (which has been spoken about in the past) and this was the theoretical cherry on top. But that\u2019s all I\u2019m really aware of.", "That's what they all say", "Yeah, it all makes sense now. They wanted her gone, and this was the final nail. You definitely shouldn't feel bad about anything."]}
