If she gets there first, the spot is hers, correct? Is she asking you to never park there so she can? Is the rest of the lot full? Are there people there other than her who would take the spot if you didn't? \n\nI can see this going both ways, but first come first serve.. just like going to Walmart. \n\nIf it's that big of deal, maybe they should start doing designated spots.", "NTA \n\nPlease hear me out. At the beginning of everyone's lease, it was understood and signed that there wasn't assigned parking. I understand that first come, first served is the unwritten rule, correct?\n\nYes, she's pregnant. She'll have her baby in a month from now. Then what? She feels she needs the closest  parking space because she has a newborn, then a stroller, then a toddler? \n\nYou all park at your own risk. I'm not seeing any handicapped situation here.", "People who have never shattered an ankle have no idea how excruciatingly painful it can be and how long the recovery process is.", "NTA, and if it matters at all I have children and know how exhausting and painful pregnancy can be.\n\nThe spots aren\u2019t assigned, so who is to say that it is even up to the two of you to decide who gets that spot?  Even if you park elsewhere, someone else besides her could take that spot.\n\nI think the best thing for her to do is to go to management and ask that a spot be designated for those who might need to park closer for whatever reason.  A broken ankle and being towards the end of pregnancy are both good reasons to use a spot like that, but until one is designated, it really isn\u2019t your spot to give or to feel bad about taking.  Management could and should make the call so it\u2019s fair for everyone.", "NTA it sounds like it's first come first park so to bad for her if you got there first", "NTA! People who are calling you the asshole clearly have no idea how broken ankles (and bones) work. You are not HEALED just b/c you get your cast off. In many ways, the pain has only just begun. It is like walking on a stump at first, as though there is no foot attached. It is VERY painful, and with therapy the pain increases the first several weeks off the crutch/scooter. You should probably make this clear via an edit in your post. NTA.", "NTA. Whoever gets there first gets the spot. It\u2019s not assigned soooo", "NTA - if she needs a special spot the complex should accommodate her.", "NTA - No assigned parking means first come, first serve. If she needs special parking accommodations, she needs to bring the issue up with the complex\u2019s management.", "Info: I don\u2019t understand how there are no designated spots but she wants \u201cyour spot\u201d? How is it your spot if it\u2019s not designated.", "If there isn\u2019t designated parking, then the parking space you\u2019re claiming as \u201cyour spot\u201d isn\u2019t yours. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH but don\u2019t claim something that\u2019s not yours.", "NTA \n\nIts first come first serve. While it might be a nice thing to do, you certainly don't have to do it and you aren't the asshole for keeping the spot.", "NTA. There is no designated parking. That means if the spot is free, you can use it, and anyone else can use it. You can't 'save' it for her, because someone else might then use it. It isn't your spot to save. \n\nBring 8 months pregnant is hard work, but she isn't injured and chose an apartment block with no designated parking.", "YTA. \n\nMy judgement hinges on you saying \"i don't want to\", rather than \"I am in pain\". I choose to believe you when you say, that you get around fine now, and are not in a disability anymore. \n\nYou had an injury, and had received the courtesy of your neighbors to take the best and closest parking spot. You received this because of the good will of your neighbors. Now, you seek to use the precedent that was given to you through the consideration of your injury, in order to upgrade your situation permanently; The other option is to give the same consideration back to the woman who previously ceded to you.\n\nFrom my perspective, you choose to not return a favor that was done to you, because not returning it benefits you.", "YTA \n\nDo you have to give up the spot no. \n\nWould you be making a pregnant person's life a lot easier with little trouble on your part now that your ankle is healed yes. \n\nI don't think you have a moral obligation here, but I do think it's clearly an asshole move to be selfish to somebody who needs the help more.", "Kinda yes, because you're being a bit entitled, kinda no, because so is she.\n\nThe apartments don't have designated parking so it is absolutely NOT your spot, and if she drives in to the car park while you're out, she is perfectly within her rights to park there and you would have no claim to it or reason to be upset about it.\n\nIf you managed to keep the spot the whole time your ankle was healing there may also be a bit of your neighbours being nice and letting you have more or less constant access to it as you were temporarily disabled going on in the background.\n\nNow she is pregnant and you are clearly capable of walking and driving fine again it would be the nice to show some basic courtesy and let her have a turn with the spot close to the building. Walking a few parking spots away won't harm you.\n\nBut then she isn't entitled to it either.\n\nThe problem seems to be a lack of accessible/disabled access/allocated parking, but you're being a bit petty and tbh if it was me I would let her and park a few spaces away, it wouldn't have any affect on my life nor on yours as you didn't use that spot before you got hurt anyway.", ">I don\u2019t want to give up my spot\n\n**INFO:** Do you still *need* to park up close?  You say you parked close because it *was* easier with the stairs and to get to your car.  You say you are now off crutches and not using a scooter.  But you avoid saying whether you still actually *need* to park close to the door.  You only say that you don\u2019t *want* to give it up.", "Nta - as someone who is pregnant with a handicap placard currently. She should get one and tell the building she needs accessible parking. Both of you should", "Based on your description, the parking is \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d. \n\nNTA", "NTA first come first served. If she gets the spot first, its hers.", "If you are fully healed, yeah, YTA.", "Yta purely on the basis that when you were struggling to walk you decided it was great for you to park up front. Now someone else has the same need and you\u2019re too selfish to see that.", "YTA. If there's no designated parking, its not technically yours. I'd wait until you leave and then just park there if I was her. However, a real man wouldn't put a pregnant woman in that position where she had to do that. Chivalry is dead I guess however.", "Yep. Yta. Give the spot up to the lady that is about to pop. Besides you arent gonna strengthen your ankle more by walking less.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019ve shattered both ankles so I do know what it\u2019s like. If you can walk with weight on your ankles then you should revert back to your OG parking spot. I\u2019d anything, walking would HELP your recovery.", "NTA, we have one spot per apartment, paid parking and visitor. I have mine then visitor has always been 100% NTA, first come first served. I ended up buying a second spot for my partner. at my old apartment was FCFS and I had newborn twins, as was the next, as was the one after and had a 10 minute walk from the back of the lot because I worked til midnight then got my kids so I got back near 1am. I haven\u2019t shattered my ankle but being pregnant, gaining 145 lbs, post birth stitches and bleeding/healing, carrying two babies and having DR is nothing compared to what I can even imagine it\u2019s like.", "Yeah i\u2019d say YTA. You\u2019re not obligated to give up your spot but this lady is about to go into labor and it would be the right thing for you to do lol.", "Yta\n\nSomething wrong with your generation that don't seem to give. It's all about take take take. She's 8 months pregnant and you don't have the decency to understand why you should let her have the spot. So bloody wrong. Just cause there isn't a spot marked for everyone im sure people let you park there to help you out instead of being twats and taking it making it harder for you hey", "YTA.  You admitted you can fully walk now, which means you can park farther away without trouble.\n\nYou also aren't pregnant.", "YTA why would not want to do something so simple that would not really negatively impact you, but very much help someone?
