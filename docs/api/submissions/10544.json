When I was hired by my current company, I made it clear that I would not accept the job if weekends were required, as my husband works M-F, often late nights (HVAC repair in Texas), and if I worked weekends, we would not see each other often. \n\nThe company agreed, as they planned to hire a part-time administrator to work both weekend days and a few hours on weekday evenings. They hired Jake, and while I work M-F from 8am-5pm, Jake works Sat-Sun from 8:30am-5pm, and M-F from 5pm-8pm. It\u2019s been working out well until this morning.\n\nJake and our boss, \u201cGracie,\u201d (f29) approached me to ask that I give up my weekends off for Jake because his family can no longer watch Lily for him on the weekends while he works due to new employment and a move. I would instead be off on Mondays and Tuesdays (Jake says that his family and friends could still help on weeknights, and he could pay for part-time daycare on Monday and Tuesday, but weekends are too expensive).\n\nI have worked and raised two daughters to adulthood. I\u2019m not lacking empathy for Jake, but I don\u2019t want to give up my time with my husband. It would hurt our marriage, and I would be lonely alone at home all day on my days off. I said no, and Gracie confirmed that it was my choice when Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together. \n\nHe\u2019s now saying if he has to find another job it will be my fault for not helping him out. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Jake will be allowed to work Saturday and Sunday remotely on a trial basis, per my suggestion. I will be permitted to work remotely on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, if I would like to, also on a trial basis!

You took the job conditional on no weekends or evenings. Jake was specifically hired for weekends and evenings. While it's unfortunate that his childcare availability has changed, it's not your issue.\n\nEvening and weekend staffing changes more frequently as people's needs change or better shifts come up.", "NTA \n\nIt would have been N A H but Jake tried to guilt you into changing your agreed schedule and that makes him TA, not the asking. \n\nSometimes circumstances change and you have to adapt and sometimes that means finding a new job.", "NTA. You made your conditions clear from the beginning. Jake needs to figure out a solution that doesn\u2019t involve making it your problem/placing the burden on you.", "NTA he is acting very entitled. His daughter is more important to him, but your marriage and your free time are more important to you.\n\nYou don\u2018t have to change your work times and your life to accomodate his new needs.", "NTA.  It doesn\u2019t matter what Jake thinks. His work schedule isn\u2019t your responsibility. He agreed to the schedule when he signed up.\n\nJake needs to learn that his family life is not more important than your family life.", "NTA this happened to me when I was deployed to afghanistan. we had a late deploying soldier and they wanted me to stay back so they can go to their kids birthday or something. I told them no I deployed early for married soldiers and I was returning home as I should because 1 I am someones child and 2we both signed the dotted line to serve and I was ready to come home.", "NTA. They\u2019re not holding up their part of your agreement, and Jake was hired for weekends. Not your problem. You may have to start looking, though.", "NTA. Your requirements to take the job were clear and have not changed. He accepted a weekend position. If that no longer works for him he needs to find a new job. his situation has nothing to do with you. Also, his response/reaction is harassment and needs to be reported to HR.", "NTA. This isn't a one-time thing. It would be permanent AND EXACTLY what the company agreed not to require of you when they hired you. Jake was hired to work weekends and some evenings. It's too bad that his childcare situation changed, but the neither the company nor you (in particular) are required to provide him with an alternative position.", "NTA. Those were your conditions to work there. He was hired to cover weekends. His situation changed, it's his problem. They asked, You rightfully refused. Sucks to be him, but his daughter is not your responsibility, your marriage is.", "NTA.\n\nYou guys had an agreement. They need to hold up their end.\n\nIf they push it, you could just quit. Up to them.", "NTA. \n\n> *Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together.*\n\nNobody can tell anyone else what their values are, in this case Jake in no way can tell you how much you value your time and how you spend it.   \n\nLikewise he can not decide HIS wants are worth more than *yours*.  \n\nIt's as asinine as someone saying you don't enjoy chocolate as much as you do, or that you shouldn't grieve your bunnies death because it's not human, or that you should like limes, etc.  \n\nYet people will always be quick to be virtuous with other people's resources.", "NTA. But saying your marriage would be harmed seems a bit exaggerated. And saying you would be lonely on two weekdays when your husband is at work sounds like you are pretty enmeshed to the point you don\u2019t have your own life and interests.", "Wait a minute did you just say that 1 weekend where you had to take over to help out a single father who has a 3 yr old daughter would hurt your marriage, OP if one weekend hurts your marriage I think there are some deeper issues in that marriage than the weekend NAH", "Exactly, he was hired specifically for the weekends and after-hours. When I was newly separated/divorcing my stbx kept encouraging to me to apply for jobs that required weekends, knowing I couldn't maintain that schedule. Instead I sought out jobs that had more flexible hours.", "This shouldn\u2019t be OPs problem anyway - it\u2019s the manager\u2019s job to sort this. She made it clear she couldn\u2019t work weekends from the start, it\u2019s not on her to change her life because of the co-worker, and it\u2019s BS that \u201cGracie\u201d put OP in the middle of it.", "Why did ge take the job in the first place? The arrangement was very clear. He needs to find an other job.", "Absolutely! Shouldn't have made you do their job for them.", "Gracie (my boss) has already apologized for that. She said Jake was going to ask me, and she thought it would be better if a manger was present as a witness, but she can see how her presence made me feel like SHE (and therefore, the company) was asking me to do this. I accepted her apology. \n\nI even suggested that Jake be allowed to work remotely on Saturday and Sunday (the only aspect of our job that REQUIRES physical presence is entering receipts in the spreadsheet and filing them, and that can be done on Monday when I get in). \n\nThe good news is that if Jake gets approved to work remotely, I\u2019ll get approved to work a hybrid schedule (two days remote/three on site)!", "I\u2019m in Texas\u2026 \u201cpart-time\u201d is defined as 35 hours or less per week, unfortunately. Jake works 30 hours.", "We are both prefer each other\u2019s company over anyone else\u2019s? Also, we literally just moved here in July (for his job/to be closer to his family) and aren\u2019t planning on this being a long-term location. I WOULD be lonely alone all day on Mon-Tues, especially knowing I wouldn\u2019t really see him at all on that schedule. Back in Louisiana, we had a tabletop gaming group we socialized with regularly. We just haven\u2019t had much time to seek out a new group, here. \n\nLastly, why do you think it\u2019s dramatic to say that rarely seeing my husband would damage our marriage? Not spending any time together is a great way to wreck a relationship.", "No, Jake wants a permanent switch, not one weekend. He wants OP to take over his weekend shifts.", "Where in the post was it written or did it sound like the change was only for a single time? I didn't read that at all. Per OP: \n\n>ask that I give up my weekend***s*** off for Jake\n\n'Weekends' *plural* which means they are asking for it to be a long-term move. This is NOT about a single weekend, full stop - that's a completely irrelevant stipulation.", "I agree with this. Thanks for posting that out. I see so many managers take this lazy and inappropriate approach.", "Now he is struggling. It\u2019s not your job to fix his mistake in accepting a job that conflicts with his parental responsibilities.", "NTA Jake's schedule is for him and his supervisor to figure out, not you.", "He took the job because he had childcare for those days, and his childcare fell through. Its right there in the post lol", "he can also ask the social worker for options for child care because of work. He is not completely without options. He just wants you schedule.\n\nHe doesn't hold the seniority you do seeing as you were hired in first. He was also hired in to work weekends. \n\nIf he harrasses you in any way you need to report it to your boss and HR. Retaliation for anything let alone not giving up your set schedule is a termination level offense no matter the company.", "OOF. That sucks. But still, working 7 days a week is brutal. Even if short hours on most.\n\nI saw another comment where it seems that anyone watching his kid has to be approved by a social worker and undergo a background check? It sounds like there is a lot more going on here. But in the end, if he needs to find a different job that works better, so be it. You were nice to offer to switch occasionally (or for a few weeks), but hell no you shouldn't give up your weekends. That was the agreement you were hired under.", "Unfortunately this shit will keep happening unless people (entitled parents especially) lose the whole \"if you don't have kids then you don't have a life outside of work\" mentally, because yes, those of us who don't have kids do have lives outside of work. We still want to spend time with our partners/families, enjoy our hobbies, or even have a break from work so we don't burn out.\n\nJake needs to realise that his daughter is more important *to him*, but not to the rest of the world.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault he has a child and no partner. It's not your fault his family can't watch her. It's not your fault for valuing having time with your husband. His circumstances shouldn't punish you. He needs to work around those circumstances, and if he has to find a different job, that's his responsibility.", "NTA, and it\u2019s not ok that your boss has this conversation in front of another employee.", "NTA", "NTA, i recently left a job myself because of an issue sort of similar and was told im not a mom and im not but i still have friends and family i would like to spend quality time with! i left and im much happier, sucks that hes looking for a new job but why would he accept a job with the times he scheduled if he knew he was moving and his family was in one place? logistically he didnt think it through thats not on you.", "NTA! I\u2019m sure the company made clear to Jake the hours of his role before he was hired. That is his issue to workout with management or he can chose to leave if he doesn\u2019t want to work those hours. Neither are your problem and he\u2019s very entitled to expect you to just roll over and change your entire work schedule.", "NTA...  Let him find another job... You have a right to time off with your family as well", "You're NTA. If the hours no longer work for him then he needs to find a new job, not take yours.", "NTA\n\nHis family isn't more important than yours.  He accepted a job working weekends.  You accepted a job never working weekends.  You don't owe it to anyone to sacrifice for your work or coworker.", "NTA Jake needs to find another job. Not your problem he has children. He has no right to judge you.", "They're making you out to be the asshole, buy your employer is the real asshole here. Jake should be able to make a living wage doing 40 hours. NTA", "nta, know a surefire way for a relationship to end? Not enough time in it.", "Totally agree with Jake, but that\u2019s his problem. He needs to find another job that suits him or his family need to make alternative arrangements.

NTA", "NTA.  \n\n>Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together.\n\nThat is his opinion and I bet your and your husband have a different perspective.  He does not get to decide his life is more important than yours.", "NTA. This is not your problem. Your husband is as equally important to you as Jake\u2019s daughter is to him. Besides, the company has him scheduled 7 days a week if I read your post correctly. They should consider combining those short shifts so he can get proper days off.", "NTA", "NTA. It was his choice to have kids at a young age. It shouldn't be your problem. As you said you set your terms before being hired. I know you have kids but often times people with kids (at least young ones) think they are a priority over other people. Married people think they are a priority over single people. They aren't. They made the choice.", "NTA but I fail to see why you would get to WFH lol.", "Nta\n\nAnd I think Jake\u2019s about to discover how wfh with a 3 year old is unsustainable", "NTA, but what if you take F and Sat off? That would give you one day by yourself and one day with your husband. Plus, your husband could pull in overtime on Sundays. Ideally, your work would hire another part timer to split weekends with Jake so you all have flexibility in your schedules.", "Nta \nIf he needs weekends off, thats not the job that is available. He needs to look elsewhere. I say that as a mom who has done alot if parenting solo. I absolutely understand its hard. But taking your schedule using kids as an excuse is why working parents get such a bad wrap. Yes you are working hard and it takes a village.  But he knew the hours when he took the job.", "NTA", "NTA. This is what it's like to be a parent, and somehow millions of them manage to work it out. He can too.", "Wait.  \"*Jake works Sat-Sun from 8:30am-5pm, and M-F from 5pm-8pm.* \"  This poor guy doesn't get a single day off?  What the hell????\n\nAnyway, this is not your problem, it's a Jake and company problem and I hope an agreeable solution is found.  NAH", "Sorry, Jake, but your life is not my responsibility. My time with my husband is more important to me, than your time with your daughter is to me. Your time with your daughter is more important, to you, than my time is with my husband, to you. But you aren\u2019t being asked to voluntarily make a change - I am.\n\nTrying to write that out sensibly\u2026. This reminds me of an old pun for some reason\u2026..\n\nI\u2019ll bet you $500, right now, no matter who you are, that I have more money in my pocket than you do.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like to take the bet\u2026. How much money do YOU have in MY pocket? None.\n\nNTA", "YTA, I have a friend that works HVAC & he sees his wife plenty.", "Re \u2018a small raise for the weekend care\u2019\u2014 wages are not about what you need but the cost of labor. It does seem that nobody wants to work weekends, so offering an incentive for nights and weekends work (for whoever does it) makes sense, because otherwise they might not be able to find anyone to do it. But that\u2019s outside of why he \u2018needs\u2019 it. Otherwise they could just say well instead we\u2019ll fire you and find someone single without children who won\u2019t need this extra childcare stipend, they\u2019ll be cheaper!

But doing it in front of the person requesting the change is just stupid.

So unprofessional!", "NTA \n\n>Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together.\n\nIt isn't even about you wanting to spend time with your husband. I don't care if you want your weekends to spend time with your dog, or to play video games or sleep all day - your schedule was determined when you were hired and your employer agreed that you would not be required to work weekends. Period.\n\nI hope you are able to retain your hybrid WFH/in office schedule that you seem excited about even after Jake has to quit or is fired, because I see that as the outcome if he's \"working from home\" while taking care of a 3yo. Maybe it would be feasible during the week when he has short shifts (and she could be napping) but full days - not seeing it.", "NTA if he were asking for an occasional weekend day maybe but not every weekend", "Nope NTA. His problems do not require your sacrifice to fix. Having time to spend with your husband is not some frivolous pursuit. Why is his family more important than your family? I\u2019m glad it worked out.", "NTA.  And why is management pressuring you when you have been very clear about your schedule?  Honestly, it's management that's the problem.  They aren't willing to hire enough people to cover the shifts.  Not your problem.", "NTA.  You have only one rule (no weekends) and haven't varied from that.  They're trying to manipulate you.", "NTA.  Good Lord.  His life is not your problem and I would have told him that.  You made your intentions clear.  He could find alternate arrangements.", "NTA and, although this is resolved. It might be a good idea to send a letter to your HR dept reminding them to review the laws re discrimination due to family status. What they tried to pull is straight up illegal.", "NTA   He didn't need to know the reason you don't work weekends. To me that was a violation of your privacy. Good luck.", "NTA - sounds like a problem your employer needs to figure out", "NTA. Jake\u2019s issue is not your problem at all.", "If he has to find another job to accommodate his childcare situation, he has to find another job.  NTA for not letting him ruin your life.", "Because the company doesn\u2019t want to make an exception for Jake alone, so now up to 16 work hours per week can be worked remotely by anyone in admin.", "Right. Because your friend works the same schedule as every other HVAC technician on the planet.", "Like just one thing to have called OP into the office and asked privately but a whole other thing to bring Jake into that causing guilt to OP.", "The company can find ways to accommodate him or he can find another job."]}
