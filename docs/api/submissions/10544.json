When I was hired by my current company, I made it clear that I would not accept the job if weekends were required, as my husband works M-F, often late nights (HVAC repair in Texas), and if I worked weekends, we would not see each other often. \n\nThe company agreed, as they planned to hire a part-time administrator to work both weekend days and a few hours on weekday evenings. They hired Jake, and while I work M-F from 8am-5pm, Jake works Sat-Sun from 8:30am-5pm, and M-F from 5pm-8pm. It\u2019s been working out well until this morning.\n\nJake and our boss, \u201cGracie,\u201d (f29) approached me to ask that I give up my weekends off for Jake because his family can no longer watch Lily for him on the weekends while he works due to new employment and a move. I would instead be off on Mondays and Tuesdays (Jake says that his family and friends could still help on weeknights, and he could pay for part-time daycare on Monday and Tuesday, but weekends are too expensive).\n\nI have worked and raised two daughters to adulthood. I\u2019m not lacking empathy for Jake, but I don\u2019t want to give up my time with my husband. It would hurt our marriage, and I would be lonely alone at home all day on my days off. I said no, and Gracie confirmed that it was my choice when Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together. \n\nHe\u2019s now saying if he has to find another job it will be my fault for not helping him out.

He took a job that's not compatible with his needs; it's not unreasonable to expect him to look for a different job to overcome this hurdle.", "NTA - Jake started the job knowing the condition of working weekends. He is also lower in senority. While it's unfortunate for him, that doesn't make you an asshole for saying no. His kids and issues with childcare are not your problem.", "NTA  Jake's schedule is for him and his supervisor to figure out, not you. If they want to keep Jake they can make accommodations for him. If he needs to find a job that fits his schedule better he can do what you did and find one.", "NTA his situation is unfortunate but not your responsibility, if it was a once off I could understand the ask but to give up weekends indefinitely is not sustainable to your lifestyle.\n\nAnd even though he might not like his daughter is only important to him. \n\nHe asked you declined so if he has to find a new job that's just life as a single parent unfortunately.", "NTA. Not your circus, not your monkeys. If Jake goes through life demanding that other people accommodate him, he's going to have a lot more problems than just this. You specified the hours that you would be able to work, and honestly I'd call your boss TAH here as well, for going from \"this new hire is to cover the hours you can't\" to \"cover those hours that you said you couldn't to accommodate the guy we hired specifically to cover those hours.\" Sure, she didn't push and said it was your choice, but it's ridiculous to even request it at that point.", "NTA You didn't put him in this situation. He accepted the job knowing the hours. I understand it's hard not to feel guilty (I've gone through similar) but you didn't make him have a kid and it shouldn't affect your life.", "NTA! The work/home balance upon the hire date is what matters in this story. You set the boundaries, Jake did not set boundaries. Now he is struggling. It\u2019s not your job to fix his mistake in accepting a job that conflicts with his parental responsibilities. If he needs to seek another job, then leaving his current job is his fault.", "NTA. You took your job on these parameters, and so did he. It would be a kind thing for you to do to give up a couple of weekends while he got his child care sorted, but it is no means necessary.", "NTA. He signed up for a weekend job. Changes in his personal situation is not your problem. You told management when you signed that you wouldn't do weekends.\n\nEnjoy your time with your husband.\n\nI am childfree by choice and I need to out strong boundaries because I just have a husband to go home to.", "NTA.\n\nI don't blame him for asking, but if he can't accept a \"no\" answer then he's the asshole.  The fact that he's blaming you for not accommodating him (and quite frankly is ridiculously disrespectful to the time you wish to spend with your family) drives the point home.\n\nIf his job does not suit him, and his employer doesn't have an alternative, he can choose to find a new job. That's not anyone's fault, it's just reality.", "NTA\n\nIts said and clear that you do not work on weekends. \n\nIts not your job to accomodate the needs of Jake. \n\nKeep your point and let management doing the job to solve this problem.", "NTA - the problem is his not yours. \n\n>Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together. \n\nHe's the AH for saying that.", "NTA.

The fact your supervisor \u201cforgot\u201d that you had requested this is somewhat unsurprising, but once you reminded them of the situation they seemed to handle it well.\n\nJake on the other hand is definitely TA, if he was going to need weekends to take care of his daughter maybe he should\u2019ve done what you did when you were hired. He didn\u2019t and now he regrets it, and on top of that he actually has the audacity to say that him and his daughters time is much more important than yours and your husbands.\n\nAgain NTA, and can assumably see why Jake doesn\u2019t have the mother of his daughter around anymore to help him with his weekends considering he was already throwing that responsibility on his family.", "NTA. Your schedule pre-existed Jakes.   You had previously made it clear about no weekends, AND he took the job knowing what his schedule, weekends, was.  He can find another job. No reason the wheel should be reinvented for him simply because his relative\u2019s ability to babysit has changed. That is such a tangential thing here why should it completely change YOUR life.  \n\nNope.", "NTA, entitled parents... Urh... There are so many good parents, but there also are people who try to make their decision to procreate into a worldwide issue. You don't owe him anything, you made your boundaries clear when accepting the job, he was hired for weekends specifically, he can't expect the arrangement to magically change.", "NTA. If you change your hours then what happens when suddenly has more daycare issues and asks for more changed. Better to keep the hours you were promised that work with your lifestyle than be the one that is always changing to help others.", "NTA, his childcare fell through, which happens all the time for working parents.  You have nothing to gain by switching your schedule.  It doesn't hurt to ask, but he should not have expected you to say yes.    It is way too much to ask someone who is neither kin nor friend to rearrange their life for you. \n\nHe needs to find employment that works for his availability.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that Jake is a parent of a young child does not make his needs more important than yours. \n\nJake was hired to work weekends. Jake is no longer available on weekends. Jake either needs to fix his weekend availability, or if he can't find childcare coverage, needs to find another job.", "NTA Jake's problems are Jake's problems. You made it clear to the company that working weekends are off limits. Jake knew the hours and days he would be working when hired by this company. If he has to find new employment because he can no longer work those hours and days that's on him. Next time he tries to guilt trip you tell him welcome to the real world and its reality.", "NTA it sucks for Jake that his situation changed but he took the job knowing the days and hours. You took your job with the same understanding. If he has to find another job it\u2019s because his life situation has changed not because of you.", "You are not the jerk. I do feel bad for Jake and I genuinely hope a solution comes up, but sometimes life doesn\u2019t happen the way you want it to. You have a simple and understandable boundary and he should respect that.", "NTA. You have no reason to feel guilty. His situation is his alone to figure out and should have zero effect on your pre-established schedule.\n\nHe's acting entitled. The world does not revolve around your co-workers changing needs.", "NTA. You made it clear that you would only take the job if you had the weekends off. \n\nJake needs to realise that the world does not revolve around him and should make other arrangements. He also needs to learn not to disrespect other colleagues because you are definitely not going to do him any favours in the future with that treatment.", "NTA Jake's situation changed Jake needs to find a new job", "NTA Why did he get a job where he was specifically hired to work weekends, if he can\u2019t work weekends?", "NTA tell Jake to grow up the world doesn't revolve around him. You're not responsible for his situation and he's TA for expecting you to change your life for him.", "NTA. His childcare issues are not your problem. It\u2019s insulting the way people with children think your life is of less value if you don\u2019t have any (or adult ones in your case) yes you do want to spend time with your husband and Jake shouldn\u2019t be trying to guilt trip you about that.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine. They asked, and you said NO. End of it. No Assholes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" when Jake got upset and told me his daughter was more important here than two adults who just WANTED to spend time together.\" .. He is wrong.

He might or might not, but NONE of that is YOUR business.", "NTA I sympathise with people with children, but expecting other people to prioritise them is too much. Also, for the same reason they ask for the special treatment - they almost never reciprocate. I learned this when I started work and would take on extra or swap shifts with people and then when I wanted my birthday off? NO ONE would take or swap the shift.", "Nta. Sucks for him, but you have done nothing wrong and owe him nothing. The terms of your employment were clear from the start. Good on you for not letting them guilt you into readjusting your life and ability to be with your husband. Contrary to what many parents of young kids think, the entire world doesn't revolve around them and their needs.", "NTA. If Jake has to find a new job, it will be because life sucks sometimes, not because you didn't help him. It was fine for him to make the request, but it wasn't fine for him to get upset and try to make you feel bad when you said no.", "NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're not responsible for his lack of childcare.   This is his responsibility to take care of, not yours, and it certainly doesn't require you to give up your schedule.  He's nothing to you but a co-worker. He's not family, a friend, etc.", "NTA, never feel like you should have to give up any time off for any coworker, regardless of the guilt trips they'll try and pull on you.", "NTA. If they said \"hey, for this one particular week can we switch your shift\" and you declined, I'd lean towards AH. But to fully switch the days you're working is unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nHis relationship with his daughter isn't more important than your relationship with your husband. I mean, it is to him, obviously, but your relationship with your husband is more important to you.\n\nHis childcare problems really aren't your issue. They asked, you said, \"no.\" That's it.  If he has to change jobs, that's not on you.  It sucks, but that's the way the world works sometimes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
