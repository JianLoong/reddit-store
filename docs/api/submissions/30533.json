I have never been a fan of drinking. My family has a history with alcoholism. I will maybe have the interest in drinking about like once every 6 months or so and even when that happens I end up not drinking. \nAt the venue where my sisters wedding will be held there I guess is some kind of tradition where they put some kind of alcohol in the ground about a month or so before the wedding and dig it up either the night before or the morning of and the wedding party takes a shot. I told my sister not only do I not like that taste of that kinda of alcohol but I don't plan on drinking at her wedding at all. She told me I have to take the shot and I got frustrated and told her I'm not getting pressured into drinking just because she's getting married. She got all Bridezilla and said I'm going to ruin the best day of her life and I told her she was being dramatic. My parents are on my side because they know how I feel about alcohol but she ended up telling her MIL and now she's telling me just to take one for the team and stop being selfish.\n I'm still standing my ground on this but I wanted to get some opinions from outside sources. AITH?\n\nNOTES: Just to clear things up I was not the one to bring it up. She was talking about the venue and about that tradition and looked at me and said we are all taking a shot. She knows how I feel about drinking and she put me on the spot. I don't care if people around me are drinking. \n\n\n\nUPDATE: Things have cooled down and I have told her your suggestions. MIL thinks they are stupid and says I should still take a shot and to stop acting like I am better than everyone. My sister is still being pissy about it and keeps saying that it's not that big of a deal to just take a shot and have a drink for the toast and since I'm the MOH I have to make it happen. I'm honestly over it. My parents stepped in and told my sister she is acting like a child and is being disrespectful and she basically called me disrespectful. Her fiance stepped in ( he didn't know about the situation until now) and told my sister she is being ridiculous and now she crying and blaming it on stress.

For chrissake, It the tradition of a freaking wedding venue your sister had never even heard of until recently, not some family or cultural tradition. Even if it was a family or cultural tradition you would not be an ahole for not wanting to drink. In fact, it is common to make adjustments to such traditions with nonalcoholic beverages for those that abstain from alcohol for whatever reasons. \n\nSister\u2019s attitude is ridiculous. Also ironic given your family history. I am betting drinking in your family has destroyed more then one marriage, insisting that someone drinking to wish her a successful marriage seems like Karma waiting to happen. \n\nIf she wants a photo of everyone drinking just fill\nA shot glass with water.

I highly doubt that. The bottom line is, you have boundaries and that line doesn't let up just because your sister is getting hitched.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't drink either, and when all the groomsman were taking a shot of Fireball, they switched his out for Gatorade.

Very rarely do I even drink socially.", "Not too sure what Carrie Nation is", "I appreciate it. I'm pretty sure my parents will be fine with it since they were fine with me not drinking it in the beginning. Problem would be the sister. She goes from 0 to 100 over the smallest issues", "Appreciate it. Alot of people suggested to talk to the venue to see if they can give me a non alcoholic alternative. I think I'll do that. Although I don't have  a good relationship with my sister and im not a big fan or her I do hope they last. They have a son together and the fiance is an amazing dad. They are both really great parents to him.", "The only reason I brought it up was because while she was explaining that whole tradition thing she looked at me and tmsaid that everyone has to take a shot. I posted this when we were both still heated so I didn't get to talk about alternatives. People on here have been giving me and I've told my sister about it.", "And I'm totally down to do a non alcoholic shot. Congratulations to your dad! My grandfather was about 30 or so years sober after he passed. I would have definitely joined we in having a soda shot", "I'm more than willing to do a non alcoholic substitute! Also, I know you wouldn't know lol but there would be no chance in hell I'd be pregnant. Ace and single \ud83d\ude02  I know what you mean and I greatly appreciate the suggestion of a non alcoholic shot and think it's a great idea. I didnt post an update on this issue and hopefully her fiance convinced her to have that option", "That would be my sister. Pure definition of melodrama. I feel like that's one reason she and I don't get along. Our personalities clash too much.", "I assuming since I would be a part of it since I'm not dimrinking? Idk I told her I would do a non alcoholic and she basically got upset all over again. She's very dramatic and honestly irritating", "I have. It's in the update. She didn't like it. People started yelling and thankfully it seems like her fiance put her in her place by saying she was being ridiculous", "That's honestly a great idea.", "We had a shot-ski at my wedding but it was pretty much all zero-proof spirits. I did get whiskey and vodka for the drinkers but they barely touched either. \n\nAnecdotally, when I was an active drunk, I never ever ever forced others to drink outside of offering a drink and then offering a soft drink instead.", "Btw, MIL sounds like an AH.  It's not her place to say a word to you.", "I like the throw it over your shoulder idea! Try to be standing in front of the MIL when that happens \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "Did you tell her no to the shot or the tradition? I think her expecting you to take a shot is unreasonable and either way she blew this out of proportion but I could see her perspective more if she was under the impression you wouldn\u2019t participate at all even with a ginger ale shot", "Tell her okay and then do what you want to do. \n\nBtw, Happy  Cake Day!", "The sister is really digging her heels in it seems.  Why does this matter so much?  Why does it matter to the MIL to the bride this not someone who is at all associated with the OP.  Her opinions don\u2019t matter.", "She was a crusader for temperance who would go into bars and smash bottles, etc with her hatchet.", "People can be great to their kids but terrible things are everyone else. Good mom but terrible sister.", "Good luck! I hope it all works out!!", "I was telling her no to the shot and she took it as me saying no to the tradition. She flew off the handle before anyone could think of alternative which was why I appreciated all the suggestions everyone has been reccomending.", "Ah lol. Then no that won't be me. I don't mind people around me drinking. I get uncomfortable when all the people are drunk around me tho.", "Sounds accurate honestly", "Yeah that\u2019s just a crazy way to react. My partner doesn\u2019t really drink and I just pour him a shot of seltzer he\u2019s already having so he can do the toast part. I\u2019ve had bartenders do it, like put two shots of just water aside for our sober people and it\u2019s always worked fine. I wouldn\u2019t let the sister be the one to give it to you because she\u2019s so weird about it but I would bet the bartender could accommodate easily", "Understandable.  There are all sorts of reasons people choose not to drink.", "Since my mom and myselfnare basically planning her wedding I'll get the number to the venue and see if they can just put in their notes to put a nonalcoholic shot aside."]}
