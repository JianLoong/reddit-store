If someone else who is not the bride and groom doesn\u2019t wish to participate in an extremely minor tradition like taking some random shot from the ground ruins the entire wedding that wedding shouldn\u2019t haven\u2019t taken place. \n\nDo what you want to do OP, good on you for not being pressured.", "NTA.  Nobody should be pressured into drinking, especially with a family history.  It doesn't really affect anybody else if you don't take a shot.  Like how does that hurt anybody?", "Take a shot of something non alcoholic. I\u2019ve taken plenty of water shots before. My friends would always make sure they got me one when everyone was doing a shot, but I wasn\u2019t drinking alcohol.", "NTA and who gives a flying fuck what her future MIL says?", "NTA- it's a ridiculous requirement. Have them bury a bottle of ginger ale as well!", "NTA. What would she do if you were an alcoholic in a 12 step program? Tell you to suck it up and drink?", "Of course you don't have to take a shot.  My wifes MOH doesn't drink, she made a toast and just lifted the glass up, then set it back down after everyone else had taken a drink.  NTA and you need to stick to your guns.", "NTA but your sister and wtf is MIL gonna do. Tell her mind her business you're not taking anything for the team. I would pour it right in the ground if I was handed a shot. You don't force alcohol on someone.", "NTA. \n\nWould she insist you take a shot if you were pregnant? If you had a religious reason for not drinking? If you were a recovering alcoholic? Would that be 'ruining her day'? If someone says they're not drinking for any reason, they're not drinking, and people should leave them alone about it!", "\u201cTake one for the team\u201d when we\u2019re talking about someone\u2019s wish to remain sober? Is your sister marrying into a fraternity?\n\nCool traditions aside, you should be able to arrange something nonalcoholic to drink with everyone else and not make a big deal about it. Apple juice, tea\u2026 water - you can get a plethora of alcohol-colored drinks to toast with so no one else has to know. You\u2019ll still be there celebrating her love and having a great time with everyone, without doing something you don\u2019t want to do.

I wouldn't drink it either.", "NTA.\n\nNobody can force you to do anything. \"Take one for the team.\" You don't have to drink or take anything for anyone. \n\nWith that being said, I'd make sure not to accept drinks from them, as they might try and spike it. This happened to my cousin, who's diabetic, she needed something else to drink and her friend brought her a drink spiked with liquor and it sent her to the hospital.

She shouldn't be forcing anyone to drink; if you not doing so ruins her wedding, that's on her. The easiest way to avoid a problem with something like this, when the event is months away, is to just nod your head and say nothing. I just read about this; it's a Southern US tradition with a bottle of bourbon buried upside down and it has to be done exactly one month before the wedding to ensure no rain on the day. You're a grown woman; you should know how to get out of something like this already. While they're all doing shots, pretend to do yours then dump it on the ground.", "YTA for making a big deal about it months in advance. You don\u2019t need to announce this stuff. You just decline the shot at the time or take it in your hand and toss it out or whatever. You decided to make it into something, when it\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t need to ask a public forum for support to then bring up again to your entire family, to reignite the drama. Be done with it already.", "YTA:  Ms. Manners would probably say the polite thing to do would be to fake it in real-time if the Bride put up resistance like that and you really didn't want to. \n\nYour waffling stance on alcohol confuses everyone and they think you are just being difficult.  \"I don't like the taste\" is the worst excuse I've ever heard for not doing something as part of a group celebration.  Hell, half the time, that is the exact point!", "ESH.\n\nThere was no reason to make an announcement months before the wedding that you didn\u2019t plan on taking a shot when you could just take a shot of water or whatever when the time comes.

For chrissake, It the tradition of a freaking wedding venue your sister had never even heard of until recently, not some family or cultural tradition. Even if it was a family or cultural tradition you would not be an ahole for not wanting to drink. In fact, it is common to make adjustments to such traditions with nonalcoholic beverages for those that abstain from alcohol for whatever reasons. \n\nSister\u2019s attitude is ridiculous. Also ironic given your family history. I am betting drinking in your family has destroyed more then one marriage, insisting that someone drinking to wish her a successful marriage seems like Karma waiting to happen. \n\nIf she wants a photo of everyone drinking just fill\nA shot glass with water. Bridezillas usually are most concerned with IG post-able photos.", "NTA. She\u2019s being an AH for trying to make you do something you\u2019re not comfortable with. As someone who likes a drink, I would never care if someone else was drinking or not. Tell them to bury a non-alcoholic drink in there for you to take a shot of with them. Or pretend to drink it for the photos but don\u2019t drink it. Then you can still be part of the \u201cmoment\u201d and in the pictures or whatever if this is really so important to her.", "Alcohol is basically a drug, if you don\u2019t want any, no one should pressure you (especially like this).

You are her sister and MOH, you are the one person who should have a clear head.\n\nEDITED for spelling", "NTA\n\nLook I get that it seems overdramatic to NOT take a one single shot - but it's also overdramatic to act like it even matters.", "Nta your sister is being a drama queen", "NTA and no-one at that wedding is going to remember or care whether you did a shot or not.", "NTA either pretend to take a sip & toss is over your shoulder or ask who wants seconds & hand it off to a groomsman or bridesmaid.", "NTA. I don't understand why they are making such a big deal out of this. Just give OP a shot of apple juice to drink. She can be present for the digging, say cheers and drink the ceremonial shot with them while everyone's boundaries are respected. Quite frankly, if your sisters wedding is ruined because OP has juice in her glass instead of alcohol, she probably shouldn't be getting married.", "NTA. \n\nYOU'RE the sole reason that her day will be ruined? I highly doubt that. The bottom line is, you have boundaries and that line doesn't let up just because your sister is getting hitched.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't drink either, and when all the groomsman were taking a shot of Fireball, they switched his out for Gatorade. See if your sister would be willing to switch your shot with an energy drink or even tea with the same colour as the alcohol so you can both get your way.", "Wait. So you\u2019re being selfish and ruining her day by not getting drunk at her wedding? That\u2019s unreal. I mean cute tradition and all, but WTF!?\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA...My in laws are all massive drinkers and any gathering means endless shots. I've made it clear i don't drink alcohol and they no longer try to push me into joining in. If there's a toast,  i fill a shot glass with water.", "NTA I understand this is her special day and all.  However not all of her guests will be able to do this.  Some may be pregnant, some may be recovering alcoholics, some may be on medications that prohibit alcohol, and some may be allergic to that drink.\n\nShe can offer it but she can\u2019t expect everyone to partake.  You let her know ahead of time is all. \n\nI remember being a kid and going to a cousins wedding.  They did the champagne \ud83c\udf7e \ud83e\udd42toast to the bride and groom. As a kid who didn\u2019t want to get arrested in America for drinking underage I refused to do it at my table.  My mom said a sip was ok at a wedding but I used my soda I was drinking instead.  I still did the ritual just with a kid appropriate drink.  I had really lax parents about drinking underage for weddings for me and overall my sister.", "NTA. If someone can\u2019t accept your sobriety then they are the AH. Not you. \n\nIf she thinks a shot is that important she\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA at all. Forcing someone to drink, smoke, inject etc etc anything, anytime is controlling behaviour reserved for pimps, human traffickers, jails, insane asylums and governments. \n\nShe needs to let you take a shot of anything else, it\u2019s the toast that counts.", "NTA. I am the same, I have nothing against drinking, I just don't like it so I don't.  No one should ever press anyone to drink if they don't want to. Take a shot of water. Not sure what's wrong with your sister pushing this, it seems really stupid.", "NTA, and you can tell her MIL to do one. She has no control over your life. Your body, your choice. How can this possibly be ruining the big day? Ugh, I hate drama queens.", "Wow\u2026 so who\u2019s being selfish??? How could you not taking a shot ruin her wedding. perhaps you can take a shot of soda or something as a symbol if she wants you to participate. And no way should anyone ever pressure you to drink alcohol. And I love wine and cocktails, but if others don\u2019t, it has no effect on me.", "Tell her your going to parachute in and out so you can't get drunk parishuting", "NTA. \n\nI was never a fan of the high of alcohol. There were only a few years when I really drank. First I just cut way back, because I don\u2019t like being drunk. That phase lasted a while, where I might have a beer or shot on socially on occasion. \n\nWhy did I quit all together you ask? Other people/peer pressure. When people knew I would have a drink on occasion, they expected every night with them to be one of those occasions. It was easier to just say, I don\u2019t do it ever, than to continue fighting about when one of those times I would have a drink was.", "No. You shouldn\u2019t have to drink if you don\u2019t want to.", ".", "NTA forcing people to consume alcohol is ridiculous!", "One for the team? Was this wedding in 1989?\n\nSeems weird to me alcohol is being forced on someone in 2023", "Right.

Hell I drank regular coke while everyone enjoyed beer and wine. My husband and I  don't drink so I've got pic of him drinking coffee and me coke. There is no wrong way to celebrate that has to have alcohol.", "Thankfully my parents are on my side. They drink but not excessively since they know that both sides have issues with it. Glass on wine during their date night or a gin and tonic when they both have the same day off work, which is rare.", "I didnt. She brought up the tradition and she told me I had to take a shot.", "Yeah, it would be much better to talk about it when the person insists you do it in front of everyone.", "I'm so sorry about your cousin. I hope they are ok.", "I didnt want to be part of the wedding. I was pressured into it because her original MOH decided she didn't want to do it.", "What if the bride had an underage sister as a bridesmaid or someone that was under 21?  I\u2019m sure the venue has had that issue before and they can have arrangements made for non-alcoholic beverages to be used.", "I already told myself I wasn't planning on drinking because there is going to be alot of others drinking and I want to make sure ( mainly my parents) are ok. Plus the alcohol they are supplying at the wedding isn't anything I'd drink. If I do drink I'll have a vodka cranberry but they are only serving whisky, bourbon, fireball, gin and wine. Those are what the bride and groom drink and they said that's the only alcohol that's being served.", "I've never heard of the tradition before so I thought it was kinda weird. Makes sense tho since her wedding is in Mississippi", "I didnt announce it. While she was explaining the tradition she looked at me and told me everyone has to take a shot.", "I should probably make a note in my original post but I wasn't the one that brought it up. She was telling us about the venue and the tradition and looked at me and said that everyone will take a shot. Which I responded woth me not taking a shot.", "Sounds like that's what the plan is gonna be. Hopefully after the wedding I don't have to see her for a while. Not on good terms with her to begin with anyway", "That's actually a great idea. I'll probably just pretend for the puc and hand it off", "I'm hoping she would be fine with that. She's the type of person that makes a mountain out of a mole hill. Which is why we don't have a good relationship.", "I also think it's an interesting tradition im just not comfortable drinking especially when practically everyone else will be also.", "A few people have said this and to be honest I haven't considered it. I kinda posted it while I was irritated so I didn't think about options. Soda or juice is actually a good idea", "Well happy cake day OP", "I\u2019m pretty sure the venue actually has a procedure for this. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve had people in the past who were sober (for whatever reason) and they can probably provide you with a shot of water or soda or some alcohol-free beverage.", "Be careful that it actually is a water shot, though. She might try to swap it for alcohol.", "I wonder why the first one backed out, what with your sister seeming like such a low maintenance person /s", "You didn't have to accept.", "To only serve alcohol that they like is extremely self centered and that clearly spills over into this situation. NTA very clearly.", "I'm from NYC and we definitely don't do this!", "I'm southern and I've lived in Tennessee and Kentucky and I've never heard of this.", "Now, you\u2019re here with it. You already decided not to drink. It wasn\u2019t a big deal until you made it one.\n\nHaven\u2019t you seen Coyote Ugly? They have the perfect way to handle this situation. There are so many ways to discreetly not drink without calling attention to yourself.", "And you can also back out, gracefully.", "It's an interesting concept I'll say that.", "That was a good movie. Feel like it was underrated", "I agree.", "Has a good soundtrack also. My cousin had the soundtrack on a CD she played in her car", "By far Bridget Moynahan\u2019s best work.", "Agrees.
