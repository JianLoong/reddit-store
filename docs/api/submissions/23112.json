You think they just want him to talk to her and make his informed decision? No, if they wanted him to just make a decision they would\u2019ve respected it. This is very clearly people who want them back together, not people who want him to keep a level head. They have been brought into her story and are clearly judging him for his decisions. Idk why he should just listen to them judge him \n\nI don\u2019t think people he\u2019s ignoring are just \u201ctrying to tell her side of the story,\u201d they\u2019re exhibiting clearly the obvious pattern-we have all seen all the time of a family or friends deciding they know better than another person on their own relationships. It\u2019s bs always."]}
