I mean, in this case it is not that difficult...It is pretty easy to not cheat.", "Wait, is not cheating too much for you?", "That\u2019s the plan! \ud83d\ude01", "Are you taking into account that even if that is the case it's not his problem?  She wanted to leave.  She turned down therapy.  He gave what she asked for.  Any responsibility he had for ended at her insistence.  She doesn't get to keep dragging him down.  If she is depressed it is her problem to deal with, not his.", "Yeah, your friend's boyfriend came back after 2 days, not 5 months later, so there's a huge difference.", "Go west young man!", "I can tell from this small interaction that you\u2019re very annoying. \n\nI stand by my vote of YTA for what you said to your sister. Being mad is fine. Don\u2019t be an asshole as well", "Yeah you're NTA & the family needs to mind their own business.", "I can practically hear the Pet Shop Boys sing already. Everything about it makes me feel freedom and triumph, even if I didn't do anything lol.", "Bro literally did nothing and was polite and you get so sassy \ud83d\ude44", "Lol I\u2019m not mad, you\u2019ve practically called me an abuser, how am I supposed to react? Get mad and yell at you so you can go \u201cSEE EVERYONE HES VIOLENT\u201d? Nah, I\u2019ll just thank you again for your comment and opinion, and tell you to have a nice day, lol.", "I didn\u2019t like him when he was cruel to his sister and instead of being a little compassionate when she started crying, told her that\u2019s what she gets for not minding her business. I really don\u2019t believe he\u2019s never done anything cruel to his ex, as he claims."]}
