I suggested that her having a mental break might be true, he seems to be in denial about the possibility, and that is likely why his family is being pushy about trying to get him to consider that. He's totally fair to remain broken up with her but I think for his own mental health it's probably best not to ignore an obvious possibility here.\n\nE: also, pragmatically, unless he's going to cut off his whole family over this then hearing them out once instead of waving it off as bullshit is probably a faster resolution; all I'm really suggesting is that he take the time to listen instead of taking the time to say he doesn't need to listen.", ">What isn't the sister's fault?\n\nHer being cheated on, obviously.", "That sounds absolutely awful, but isn't necessarily inconsistent with some kind of mental break, which often includes pushing people away with dramatic and shitty gestures due to feelings of unworthiness.

I guess it wasn't sunnier on the other side. You're entitled to your anger. And your sister? Wow. I wouldn't take relationship advice from her either.
