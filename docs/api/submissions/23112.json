Even if they don't, they have \"friends\" on the outside who will do the controlling for them.", "No no.  That\u2019s what she gets for not cheating on her husbands and then talking shit about relationships.", "True.

Sigh, yes, your sister should have minded her own business, but you yourself admitted you snapped (what you said, was below the belt).

But your question wasn't about your former gf, it was about your sister, and I think your response to her was out of line too. You're comng across as someone very inflexible and very judgemental and downright unpleasant. Yes, your sister was pushing too hard and implying something dreadful; no matter what your gf does, that's her decision, not yours. But that doesn't give you the right to bring up something entirely unrelated in your sister's past, which may or may not even be accurate. There are better ways to say \"this isn't something I'm going to discuss with you now or in the future. It's my business, not yours.

I'm proud of you for having such a healthy self-esteem and good boundaries. You deserve so much better than to be treated the way you were by your ex and I'm sure you will find it.

You get to say you're married to guys hitting on you. Plus, you're that man's everything most the time. You visit, talk on the phone, write letters, and are often their only support system. But you get to keep your autonomy. All the relationship, but no sex (most prisons don't allow conjugal visits anymore) and no fear. Most prisons won't even let you touch each other during visits and violent criminals are often only allowed to visit through glass. I get why they choose it. Sounds great until the parole board goes whacky and lets them out."]}
