Ever since she knew she's probably losing her job soon, she starts belittling others more viciously.\n\nUnfortunately, I am one of the people she belittles. While I understand she does this as a way to make herself feel better, but she likes to judge/make assumption about my personal life (even though I rarely talk about it at work) and sometimes praising herself for being better than me\u2014then spreading that misinformation to other coworkers. For example, she said she was glad she wasn't like me; because I love reading and hanging out with my friends that I must be neglecting my husband at home. Or I that I'm spoiled because I brought my mom's cooking to work ONCE. She also talked to people from other department that I was the one turning her in to our manager, while in reality our manager asked people in our team one by one about her performance before he talked to her about it.\n\nI usually ignored her because what she said is not true and not cause any real damage to my career, but my tipping point is when she said something about my struggle to conceive. She said my struggle is caused by our own mistake; God is not going to give us any children because I'm too focused at my career and education. In her point of view, marriage is about having babies and if that's not our priority, then God is going to ignore our prayers for children. While it's true my husband and I postponed our pregnancy, it's been a year since we tried for a baby, so it kinda hit me right where it hurts. When she said this, I snapped and told her at least I have a loving and caring husband.\n\nAfter our \"argument\", she stopped spreading rumors about me. Instead, she started avoiding and blatantly excluding me on her conversation. Deep down I'm glad that I snapped at her if it means standing up to her, but I also know she's hurt by my words\u2014and I felt childish for saying those things to her, for getting involved in office's drama. I feel like our \"argument\" starts to affect our professional relationship as she continuously avoiding me. I feel like I cross the line here. So, AITA for snapping at her?

What did she think would happen?\n\nIt seems like a good think that she's avoiding you, right? I wouldn't want to talk to a person like her.", "NTA. Normally I'd say (gently) by the husband remark you kind of pulled yourself down to her level.. BUT the things she said about your struggle to conceive were so out of order, disrespectful, rude, intentionally hurtful, damaging, inappropriate and cruel. I'm sorry she said that to you.\n\nThe people who use very painful situations against you like she did when she spoke of your struggle, means she is a deeply unhappy and insecure person. Maybe a little jealousy there too! \n\nYour comment about her husband only came because she talked so freely about it anyway, you snapped at her because she wouldn't leave you alone. I'd probably have done the same thing. Easy to see why she's on her way out of that job.\n\nI hope you are doing OK OP. \n\nI'd really strongly advise you discussing this with your boss or HR and have these comments on record somewhere in case she does this again.", "NTA\n\nIf you want respect, you must give respect. I'm sorry about how you were treated by her. She used something from your personal life against you, something that you have been struggling with quite a lot. She had absolutely no right to do that, older or not. Please don't blame yourself.", "The fact that you\u2019ve posted this shows how much NTA you are. Sounds like you gave her a long lead before you had a reaction, and she really went below the belt. Her constant belittling isn\u2019t healthy and she was likely to get a reaction at some point. \n\nIf you think she\u2019s gonna be around a while and it\u2019s better for your mood and mental health, apologise for snapping, but make it clear why you did and that you\u2019d appreciate if she didn\u2019t talk to you or about you like that. Unfortunately some people use personal information as fuel, so be careful who you share this with.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you should not have snapped, you should have reported her.", "NTA. You snapped. It wasn't very gracious but she had it coming and it seemed to work in your favor.  I recommend grey rocking at work.  If you don't share deeply personal information, people like her won't have ammo when they want to hurt you. Stick to small talk, vet people before befriending them and once you know you can trust them, feel free to share whatever.", "In looking at this, I'm seeing pettiness operating in ***two*** people here, not just one. Which doesn't change the fact that you're NTA in this situation.\n\nJust as an example: \"Or I that I'm spoiled because I brought my mom's cooking to work ONCE.\"\n\nSeriously? You're letting this bother you?\n\nIt seems obvious to me that she's jealous, probably because you have a good relationship with your mother who is willing to cook for you at least once in a while. Why is she (and you) even worried about how many times your mother cooks for you? If I was in your workplace, I think it would be nice for you to have home-cooked meals to bring in for your lunch. But what I'm hearing from you is, \"Oh, I'm bringing in my mother's home-cooked food for lunch today. Better not do it too often or people will think I'm spoiled! So, I'll only do it once. ONCE!\"\n\nDo you not even see how ridiculous it is to worry about that? It's petty, no-lifed, jealous and immature. If you did that every single day, I wouldn't snipe about how spoiled you supposedly are. I'd be happy for you, and I'd also think that your mother must be a wonderful person.\n\nShe's probably also jealous because she's about to lose her job. It sounds like she'll be gone soon enough. But there's no reason you're not allowed to help things along. If she's gossiping about you, there's no reason you shouldn't complain about it. Your workplace might be collecting information about her to justify her dismissal. So, give them another log to throw on the pile.\n\nI'm not saying that you should do this to be petty. I'm saying you should do this because you have a right to do your job without someone creating a hostile work environment. And if someone's active gossip about you is interfering with that, then someone should be reported.\n\nYou're N-T-A for standing up to her. But I'm also pointing out that you shouldn't have to. Not in your workplace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The way you snapped at her was very mild compared to how she spoke to you and about you.  The stuff she said to you is bad enough to have her fired for creating a hostile work environment.

And you don't have to go along with unreasonable cultural norms either.   It's pretty culturally normal to be accepting of guns in my country, but I'm not at all accepting of them.  She decided to attack and then shocked pikachu face when she gets it right back.   Maybe she should just shut her mouth if she doesn't have anything nice to say.

Why am I not surprised that this hypocrite wants to talk about \"God's will\" or whatever.  She sounds like such a \"devout Christian\".  If she's avoiding you, that's good.  Just make sure your manager is aware of your conversation with her in case your coworker decides to somehow cause trouble.  Also, her comments to you could be considered harassment.  You could also get HR involved if she starts up again.", "Oh honey. NTA. She is a spiteful and cruel woman and that comment needs to be reported ASAP. That is grounds for firing with everything else you have mentioned. Im so sorry!", "NTA. She doesn't get to lash out at people because she's a screw up and her marriage is falling apart. You won't have a professional relationship much longer anyway. Sounds like management is sick of her crap and are doing what they can to have a case to get her out ASAP and that is not your fault or your problem."]}
