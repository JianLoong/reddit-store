I'm not sure reading the messages to your mom accomplished anything.", "NTA.  But reading those texts to your mom was wrong.  Whether she wanted to hear it or not, I'm sure she's regretting hearing it.  My heart breaks for her.  Your brother sb blocked.  He's made a mess of his life & the only one who can fix it is him.  The only way you sb talking to your bro is if he's asking for help.  He doesn't seem like he even wants help.  Drugs change people.  They can make people very angry & everything triggers them.  Mom stepped in & tried to stop the drug use so now he's angry at her.  We hurt the ones we love the most.", "I felt like it was a mistake, because she was extremely upset. Although she said she wanted to hear it because he would refuse to talk to her. At the time I was stuck on deciding what to do.", "As a recovering addict I can tell you that this is the way.", "NTA. For a moment I thought this was going to be one of my nieces writing about their older brother. They continually called him out of his crap until he cut off contact, then he massively lashed out at all of us (including wishing death upon some of us) when it was time for his rock bottom spiral. \n\nIt's going to get worse before it gets better. Preserve your sanity. Let him know you love him, but until he stops using you as a dumping ground, you are done. At some point you may be needed to get him into treatment, if you are mentally and emotionally willing to do so. Until then, distance is your best friend. Good luck.", "NTA if you do block him, but I would say at least give him the ultimatum. If you message me further with anger and hatred about mum or me, we're done and I'm blocking you. This is absolutely your last chance and if you can't respect that then that's it.\n\nIf he continues to do it after he'll always know exactly why with no questions, no confusions, no bullshit he can argue around.", "NTA. People like this often don't start to change for the positive until they realize they have no one left to turn to. Also if your mother is still paying his debts/housing, convince her to stop as she's only enabling the behavior.", "NTA for blocking the brother, but trending on assholish to yourself for being the middleman between him and your mother.   Passing on a lot of those messages was actually cruel, she didn't need to hear it.   Especially not the specific phrasing when it was soo dark.\n\nBut really you should be aware of the truth 'people shoot the messanger.'    Understand that your mom is really, REALLY hurt about your brother.  She can't easily focus her anger on him so it's a lot easier to project it onto you.   This is basic human psychology."]}
