She was thrilled when we told her and happily helped with planning and budgeting for her two-week stay. It took a lot of bargaining on her end, but we agreed to let her travel alone on the condition that she checks in with me regularly (I live in Tokyo for work). She reluctantly agreed.\n\nIn secret, I told her that she doesn\u2019t need to tell her every move because she\u2019s an adult and doesn\u2019t need a babysitter. I really just needed to know that she was alive and not in jail or something. She was much happier with the arrangement after that.\n\nEventually, the subject of lodgings came up, and our dad (54) wasn\u2019t all that happy with her choices. They were either too expensive, too shady, or too far (idk why this was an argument, tbh. She\u2019s *traveling*). He asked if she could stay with me for the trip. Whatever she saved on lodgings, she could use as additional spending money, he said. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food or strict check-in/out times either. I agreed that it was an option, but told him that I\u2019d talk it over with my sister first. While I knew that she\u2019d love to have more money to spend on merch or clothes, she probably also wanted a trip without any of her family breathing down her neck.\n\nWhen talked to my sister though, she was furious. I tried explaining myself, but she wasn\u2019t happy (understatement) that I was messing with her plans. She\u2019d already booked her hotels/bnbs and now she had to jump through hoops to cancel and refund everything. My apartment was too cramped and too far from where she wanted to go. She\u2019d be wasting her supposed savings on traveling. My apartment is a little tight for two people, yes, but we could probably manage. Still, I saw her point. So I said that she didn\u2019t want to stay with me, I would be glad to help her find arrangements when she arrived and keep it a secret. But then she blew up, said she had enough and yelled that there was no point in her going if people kept messing with what she wanted to do.\n\nMy parents called the next day to say that her trip was cancelled. She didn\u2019t want to go anymore and no amount of convincing or itinerary changes would change that. I feel awful because she\u2019d been looking forward to coming here for years. I wished that I\u2019d helped her push to stay where she wanted instead of making it seem like I agreed with my dad. Her lodgings probably weren\u2019t the only things they argued with her about, but me interfering was probably the last straw.\n\nI\u2019ve tried calling her, but she won\u2019t pick up my calls. Our brother says to leave it, her mom has been cycling being mad at her, my dad, or me, and my dad says she\u2019ll get over it eventually and was being a brat.

It's her money she is spending, her life and one day no one has  say in it anymore. She is 22 and old and wise enough to decide it all on her own. Just be supportive instead of controlling :)", "NTA.

Your other sibling is right, just leave her alone.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t understand all the Y T A verdicts. All you did was talk to her, as you were asked to.\n\nShe as an adult was more than capable of saying no, and leaving it like that.\n\nThat she didn\u2019t, and went off cancelling everything and ended up cancelling the trip altogether is probably why the rest of the family didn\u2019t want her traveling alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I talked to my dad about my where my sister would be staying, it was during the semi-regular VC I have with my family.", ">If your sister wanted unilateral control of the trip, she could pay for it herself like an adult.\n\nI never knew that receiving a gift rendered someone a child, or that the gift giver then gets to dictate how the gift is used.", "Yup, I am! I was the babysitter, and my brother is trying for med school and everything.", "Maybe they're paying for the trip, at least in part? That's the only reason I could see as to why they'd have *any* say about her trip at all.", "Yeah I don't think OP is the AH, she seems to be trying to help her sister do her own thing. The parents are the AHs.", "OP is a woman", "I agree with your comment. The parents seem to be the difficult ones and OP was providing information and helping the younger sister out, knowing full well that dad is controlling. OP: NTA but your family members are and sister seems a bit of a brat. What was their dad going to be able do once she gets to Japan? Not one damn thing.", "Oh ok, I was confused thanks for clearing that up.", "Genuinely felt like I was going crazy with all these y t a s. \n\nLike she's literally only saying yes or giving half answers (like saying \"I'll talk with her later\") to the parents so they'd stop pestering both her and her sister. \n\nThen she has a discussion with the sister about what the only actual condition is (which is checking in with your nearby family when you're travelling to a foreign country on your own, which is somehow overstepping boundaries and infantilizing according to the y t a s???).  Other than that she can do whatever she wants to, without needing a chaperone or babysitter.\n\nAnd then when she gives her sister THE OPTION to either stay with her to cut down on costs (thus allowing her more spending money) or keeping with the original plan (and obviously just lying to the parents), the sister blows up at the only person actually trying to help her? She cancels the entire trip and OP is being blamed???? What???? \n\nNTA OP. If I were to believe that you actually did have her back, then your sister is unfairly aiming her anger at the only ally she has against her overbearing parents.", "I think people are not reading it comprehensively? They just see people making the rules for an adult and not realizing the OP also agrees these rules are dumb and is trying to help her sister do her own thing?", "Lol. Figured. None of these YTA comments understand the extent of Asian parents' need to control. Is it ok? No. But can you do much about it? Also no. And honestly, based on what you have posted I don't even understand what's the problem. They wanted her to live with you to both save money and ensure safety and I cannot for the life of me see what is wrong with that. You're clearly ok with letting her do her own thing. What's the issue? That is the exact way I traveled while I still lived at home.\n\nYour sister managed to score a fully paid solo trip at 22 and she is still like it's not enough. That is insane. If she wants to cut off her own nose to spite her face, let her. She is being an idiot.", "Given your response I would amend my judgement to NTA and neither is your sister-- but your dad is for micromanaging her trip and your step mom for not sticking up for her daughter.  Write your sister a sincere letter of apology and let her know if she rebooks the trip you'll back her plan 100%.", "Yeah they're trying to secretly give the sister independence while there. Get lodgings in secret, not completely follow the parents' agreement", "It sounds like the father has A LOT of control over his adult children. Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing but I still find it bs", "Are you assuming that not a single Asian person has posted and disagreed with the situation? Let me change that. Hello, half Asian-American here. OP, and your family besides your sister, YTA. She is an adult, stop infantilizing her.", "I\u2019m from an Asian country as well. With much more liberal parents. But I understand the Asian mindset. I also don\u2019t see how OP is the AH.\n\nThe whole \u201ca gift shouldn\u2019t come with strings\u201d is such a western concept, it\u2019s laughable.\n\nHonestly, if she doesn\u2019t want her parents butting in, she should have used her own money for a trip overseas.", "That\u2019s the weirdest part. Same gender as well. Does OP\u2019s sister have some type of disability she didn\u2019t mention? What age was Op allowed to travel unattended? Does Op check in with her parents everyday for her own proof of life??", "Input; Fair.\n\nOverbearing control over a grown adult; Fuck no.", "I mean, there\u2019s input and then there\u2019s control. Japan is one of the safest countries in the world for solo female travellers and she has a sister who lives in the country. I lived in Japan for 18 months. I\u2019ve subsequently spent the next 20+ years solo travelling the world. The only place I\u2019ve felt as safe was Korea. Dad\u2019s demands are ridiculous and demonstrate a disturbing lack of awareness about the country one of his daughter\u2019s lives in. He should never have offered to pay if he wasn\u2019t willing to let her have even a tiny bit of independence.", "Lmao clearly the American side took over. Sit down. You have clearly zero understanding of how familial dynamics work for the rest of us\n\nETA: She can either be an adult and pay for her own trip or act childish the way she is currently doing.", "My wife has two significantly younger siblings from her parents' second marriages that ended up with major 'youngest child' syndrome. I.E. Her younger brother wanted to go to a con at the age of 20 and his parents (who he lived with) wouldn't allow it because it was out of state and 'he's a young 20' (even though my wife went to college out of state at 18). Her younger sister moved in with her boyfriend at age 22 and her mom was freaking out that she was too young, when I reminded her that by 22 my wife and I had been living together for 4 years and were engaged she said 'that's entirely different, you two were committed to each other' (spoiler: the younger sister married that boyfriend too).\n\nParents sometimes get over-protective of the youngest children because it's their baby.\n\nETA: I should say in these examples it's the parents that have 'youngest child' syndrome though the 20yo did cave to his parents arguments.", "Worry is not a valid excuse to micromanage a 22-year-old adult's travel plans", "Oof, not you trying to deny another Asian woman their opinion AND familial culture. It's AAIP heritage month, sis. Fuck off with that, \"elitist Asian,\" attitude.", "Not you viewing your privileged bubble as the end all of experience and coming here to tell _me_ what is and isn't acceptable for dynamics you have no comprehension of. The ABC is strong with you"]}
