{"id": 17030, "submission_id": "13fc1y3", "title": "AITA for making my sister cancel her trip?", "selftext": "My (27F) younger sister (22) will be graduating soon, and my family is gifted her a trip to Japan later in the year. She was thrilled when we told her and happily helped with planning and budgeting for her two-week stay. It took a lot of bargaining on her end, but we agreed to let her travel alone on the condition that she checks in with me regularly (I live in Tokyo for work). She reluctantly agreed.\n\nIn secret, I told her that she doesn\u2019t need to tell her every move because she\u2019s an adult and doesn\u2019t need a babysitter. I really just needed to know that she was alive and not in jail or something. She was much happier with the arrangement after that.\n\nEventually, the subject of lodgings came up, and our dad (54) wasn\u2019t all that happy with her choices. They were either too expensive, too shady, or too far (idk why this was an argument, tbh. She\u2019s *traveling*). He asked if she could stay with me for the trip. Whatever she saved on lodgings, she could use as additional spending money, he said. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food or strict check-in/out times either. I agreed that it was an option, but told him that I\u2019d talk it over with my sister first. While I knew that she\u2019d love to have more money to spend on merch or clothes, she probably also wanted a trip without any of her family breathing down her neck.\n\nWhen talked to my sister though, she was furious. I tried explaining myself, but she wasn\u2019t happy (understatement) that I was messing with her plans. She\u2019d already booked her hotels/bnbs and now she had to jump through hoops to cancel and refund everything. My apartment was too cramped and too far from where she wanted to go. She\u2019d be wasting her supposed savings on traveling. My apartment is a little tight for two people, yes, but we could probably manage. Still, I saw her point. So I said that she didn\u2019t want to stay with me, I would be glad to help her find arrangements when she arrived and keep it a secret. But then she blew up, said she had enough and yelled that there was no point in her going if people kept messing with what she wanted to do.\n\nMy parents called the next day to say that her trip was cancelled. She didn\u2019t want to go anymore and no amount of convincing or itinerary changes would change that. I feel awful because she\u2019d been looking forward to coming here for years. I wished that I\u2019d helped her push to stay where she wanted instead of making it seem like I agreed with my dad. Her lodgings probably weren\u2019t the only things they argued with her about, but me interfering was probably the last straw.\n\nI\u2019ve tried calling her, but she won\u2019t pick up my calls. Our brother says to leave it, her mom has been cycling being mad at her, my dad, or me, and my dad says she\u2019ll get over it eventually and was being a brat. I\u2019m fully aware that there was some bratty behavior from her here, but I know I\u2019d be angry too if people ruined a trip I was looking forward to.", "created_utc": 1683869932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fc1y3/aita_for_making_my_sister_cancel_her_trip/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or did you tell her this was the new plan? If the first, while she was understandably frustrated with how she was being infantilized through this whole process, her reaction was over the top. If the second, you were one of the AH\u2019s in this situation.\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t understand why everyone thought they got a say in where she stayed and what she did.

Your sister is an adult and can make her own decisions on where she wants to go snd stay.  I went backpacking solo in Sth America when I was younger then your sister.

And your mom isn\u2019t taking responsibility for anything.", "NTA, it's not like you forced her to stay with you, you gave it as an option, right?\n\nBut i get your sister too, a very controlling family isn't fun, i know firsthand how that feels. I think it is best to give her space, tell her she can still go if she decides that she wants again and that she is free to plan it as she'd like. It's her money she is spending, her life and one day no one has  say in it anymore. She is 22 and old and wise enough to decide it all on her own. Just be supportive instead of controlling :)", "NTA. She ruined her own trip. It\u2019s not hard to respond maturely. Maybe she wasn\u2019t ready to travel by herself if she can\u2019t even handle the people paying for the trip making suggestions.", "NTA- You were trying to help her out, and she\u2019d not only save money by staying with you but she\u2019d also be safer. \n\nIt\u2019s sounds like she was too immature for the trip anyways.", "NTA\n\nYour sister ruined the trip for herself. Sure, your dad was annoying, but he was paying for the whole thing and she had the option to do whatever she wanted in secret anyway. She's the one who flipped the table in a childish tantrum and walked away from this. She'll get over it.", "NTA. You tried to do her a favor honestly and she\u2019s being a brat. Maybe she should pay her own way and then she can really do whatever she wants. Also, she\u2019s an adult. Dad needs to lay off. Your other sibling is right, just leave her alone.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t understand all the Y T A verdicts. All you did was talk to her, as you were asked to.\n\nShe as an adult was more than capable of saying no, and leaving it like that.\n\nThat she didn\u2019t, and went off cancelling everything and ended up cancelling the trip altogether is probably why the rest of the family didn\u2019t want her traveling alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should pay for it herself and ignore them.", "Just correcting, not passing a judgment.\n\nI'm refraining from passing judgment, because I don't think my experience in my country is applicable in the USA.\n\nFor me 22 and 27 is quite different.\nIn my country you still live with your parents while in college/university until 23 and usually we don't work during that time, so we are 100% financially dependent on our parents. Probably even a couple years later while working to save up money for a house.\n\nAt 22 for me, my parents would not be defining my itinerary or what happens on the trip, but they definitely would have to approve the trip itself, since I live with them and they support me financially still. \n\nThey would worry about me and want to know if I have good enough accomodations and if I am going to safe places. My mother would defenitely rather I stay with my brother, since it's safer. But I take all of her questions as she worrying for me and show her all the ways and things I researched and planned to make everything safer, which usually calms her down.\n\nShe was especially nervous on my first trip ever and on my first outside-of-the-same-continent trip (Japan too). She actually stayed all night awake seeing the plane's real time trajectory in some site and waiting for us to text that we arrived. \n\nI just make sure to check in with her at least once a day (probably more) so she knows I'm alive and well. I just see it as her worrying for her kid and try to show her I have got this and calm her down.\n\nI researched properly, I have health travel insurance, I take a mini pharmacy with me for whatever might happen, I have the emergency numbers that might be needed  I know which are the bad areas to avoid specially at night, I know how hospitals/clinics work in Japan for foreigner, etc.\n\nFrom my perspective I would say N-A-H, I understand her frustration in having everyone trying to change the trip, but I also understand how worried the family is and would try to be more understanding while still holding firm. But I understand this might not translate for how things work in the USA", "For reference, we\u2019re not from the USA but an Asian country. So her family/financial situation is similar to yours. I can argue, though, that our dad and her mom are generally controlling, even now having moved away, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s all borne of worry.\n\nAs far as I know, she was on track for things like insurance and emergency plans. I wasn\u2019t really involved in the planning except for suggestions of places she might want to go. Looking back, I shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in the living arrangements unless she asked me. I just assumed that since my dad called that it was on the table."]}
