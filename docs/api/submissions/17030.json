She was thrilled when we told her and happily helped with planning and budgeting for her two-week stay. It took a lot of bargaining on her end, but we agreed to let her travel alone on the condition that she checks in with me regularly (I live in Tokyo for work). She reluctantly agreed.\n\nIn secret, I told her that she doesn\u2019t need to tell her every move because she\u2019s an adult and doesn\u2019t need a babysitter. I really just needed to know that she was alive and not in jail or something. She was much happier with the arrangement after that.\n\nEventually, the subject of lodgings came up, and our dad (54) wasn\u2019t all that happy with her choices. They were either too expensive, too shady, or too far (idk why this was an argument, tbh. She\u2019s *traveling*). He asked if she could stay with me for the trip. Whatever she saved on lodgings, she could use as additional spending money, he said. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food or strict check-in/out times either. I agreed that it was an option, but told him that I\u2019d talk it over with my sister first. While I knew that she\u2019d love to have more money to spend on merch or clothes, she probably also wanted a trip without any of her family breathing down her neck.\n\nWhen talked to my sister though, she was furious. I tried explaining myself, but she wasn\u2019t happy (understatement) that I was messing with her plans. She\u2019d already booked her hotels/bnbs and now she had to jump through hoops to cancel and refund everything. My apartment was too cramped and too far from where she wanted to go. She\u2019d be wasting her supposed savings on traveling. My apartment is a little tight for two people, yes, but we could probably manage. Still, I saw her point. So I said that she didn\u2019t want to stay with me, I would be glad to help her find arrangements when she arrived and keep it a secret. But then she blew up, said she had enough and yelled that there was no point in her going if people kept messing with what she wanted to do.\n\nMy parents called the next day to say that her trip was cancelled. She didn\u2019t want to go anymore and no amount of convincing or itinerary changes would change that. I feel awful because she\u2019d been looking forward to coming here for years. I wished that I\u2019d helped her push to stay where she wanted instead of making it seem like I agreed with my dad. Her lodgings probably weren\u2019t the only things they argued with her about, but me interfering was probably the last straw.\n\nI\u2019ve tried calling her, but she won\u2019t pick up my calls. Our brother says to leave it, her mom has been cycling being mad at her, my dad, or me, and my dad says she\u2019ll get over it eventually and was being a brat. I\u2019m fully aware that there was some bratty behavior from her here, but I know I\u2019d be angry too if people ruined a trip I was looking forward to.", "created_utc": 1683869932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fc1y3/aita_for_making_my_sister_cancel_her_trip/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it is best to give her space, tell her she can still go if she decides that she wants again and that she is free to plan it as she'd like. It's her money she is spending, her life and one day no one has  say in it anymore. She is 22 and old and wise enough to decide it all on her own. Just be supportive instead of controlling :)", "NTA.

Sure, your dad was annoying, but he was paying for the whole thing and she had the option to do whatever she wanted in secret anyway. She's the one who flipped the table in a childish tantrum and walked away from this. She'll get over it.", "NTA. You tried to do her a favor honestly and she\u2019s being a brat. Maybe she should pay her own way and then she can really do whatever she wants. Also, she\u2019s an adult. Dad needs to lay off. Your other sibling is right, just leave her alone.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t understand all the Y T A verdicts. All you did was talk to her, as you were asked to.\n\nShe as an adult was more than capable of saying no, and leaving it like that.\n\nThat she didn\u2019t, and went off cancelling everything and ended up cancelling the trip altogether is probably why the rest of the family didn\u2019t want her traveling alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, there are 1 million things to do in tokio. But the sister didn't want this and canceled it. \n\n\nThis is not actually a childish decision. To go just because it is paid for is childish. Standing up for yourself and to not go or to pay for yourself is the mature decision.", "It sounds a lot more like she had no options to do what she wanted at all. \n\n\nSister bargains against parent to be allowed to make her own travel plans and not be babysat. This was at one point agreed. \n\n\nOp helps sister plan entire trip (nice) but than contacts parents and discusses the entire trip with the parents without the sisters involvlment (... why? )\n\n\nOp did not talk to sister about cancelling everything she actually wanted to and to stay the entire trip in tokio. She just told the parents that this was a valid option. \n\n\nDad very very likely told sister to either be babysat by your sister and stay only in your sisters apartment or you don't go. \n\n\nSister felt betrayed and decided to take the second option. \n\n\nI personally fully understand this.

You might see yourself as the one trying to protect them from mom and dad.  Do they feel that way? Do they see you as the one implementing what mom and dad?", "If you're an adult yourself \"I didn't know better\" is not a response. Do you always live so far up your dad's asshole? Does anyone in your family have any autonomy or behave like a grownup with your own thoughts and feelings?", "Where on earth did you get 'contact the parents and discusses entire trip' from?\nSounds much more like the dad called her asking for that option and she went straight to saying 'Yes (to make sure the trip can go through no matter how many hurdles dad tries to come up with) and I'll talk it over with my sister directly'. No discussing over sister's head, just getting the dad off her back and going back to giving her the real options in private.", "Still, all I see is a spoiled rich girl temper tantrum. When you have everything handed to you and you flip out because it's not exactly as you wanted it, I just can't respect that. If that's what she wants, then yes, she should wait and make enough money to go on her own. But until then I think it's completely fair to have daddy's boundaries in place and work with your sibling to go around them.", "I lived in Sweden when I was 16 and while I had a host family I travelled all over the country by myself with friends.

He asked me\"\n\n\nWhere did the topic came up if not in a conversation?\n\n How did you get that dad asked her in a different conversation?\n\n\n Why would op tell dad to discuss with sister, if sister would've been part of that conversation?", "You know nothing about her work ethinc or how she financed her studies. The amount of info you make up to get to your judgment of her is surprising to me. Lets agree to disagree on this.", "Eventually the topic came up can also mean during weeks of planning for the trip this topic came into focus. It doesn't have to indicate am actual conversation taking place between the dad and older daughter.", "I don't think I'm making assumptions though. All I see is that her parents are funding a long and expensive trip for her, and she's squandering it because she can't use her father's money however she wants. And now she's walking away from her dream vacation instead of working with her sister to find ways to go behind their father's back to make it as close to what she actually wants as possible. That is incredibly childish.", "Well if it is more about controlling and less about worrying, then I can see her point. Especially if it is something that has been happening for her whole life.\n\nIf you think her parents are being unfair and just controlling, then show her that you are on her side. Either stand up to the parents or, if that is not a good idea, tell the parents that she's staying with you, but let her stay wherever she wants. \n\nBesides that, unless she is staying in Tokyo the whole trip, it doesn't even make sense for her to stay with you all of the time. Is she going to take the shinkasen every time she wants to go to Kyoto or Osaka or place faraway like that instead of staying a couple of days there? Makes no sense.\n\nIf they are unreasonable, just cover for her with the parents and help her when needed. I do think she could keep you updated, like just a text message everyday saying 'still alive' and some extra messages if she is doing something more dangerous like hiking a difficult trail. But make it clear, this would never be for control, only for you to know that everything is okay and she doesn't need you.\n\nI also think you (or if she feels more confortable, a good trusted friend of hers) should have her itinerary and hotel information in case something happens you know who to contact and how to find the last place she was at. This information should not be used for anything from your side unless you think something bad happened. This is specially important if she plans on hiking difficult trails. There was a post on reddit recently of woman that disappeared on a trail in Japan, I believe they had to get private searches and they haven't found her yet.", "Would you want every part of what's supposed to be a gift trip be micromanaged by someone else who also overwrites every single decision you make? Do you like being treated like an inept baby?", "Noooo, but if I know that the gift is so conditional and works in a \"my house, my rules\" basis, I wouldn't act like a petulant child. I would work with my ally to help me get out of that trip everything I want, not flip the table and walk away from it all.", "Or you would do the reasonable thing and not accept a gift from such controlling people. Which is what she did.", "I rarely sacrifice my self interest on principle if I can go around the controlling behaviour\nEdit: especially not out of anger", "And why would you want to go through such hoops for what was supposed to be a gift? Again, if the family is going to be so controlling and condescending then I'd rather not take any \"gift\" from them."]}
