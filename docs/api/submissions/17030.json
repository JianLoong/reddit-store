She was thrilled when we told her and happily helped with planning and budgeting for her two-week stay. It took a lot of bargaining on her end, but we agreed to let her travel alone on the condition that she checks in with me regularly (I live in Tokyo for work). She reluctantly agreed.\n\nIn secret, I told her that she doesn\u2019t need to tell her every move because she\u2019s an adult and doesn\u2019t need a babysitter. I really just needed to know that she was alive and not in jail or something. She was much happier with the arrangement after that.\n\nEventually, the subject of lodgings came up, and our dad (54) wasn\u2019t all that happy with her choices. They were either too expensive, too shady, or too far (idk why this was an argument, tbh. She\u2019s *traveling*). He asked if she could stay with me for the trip. Whatever she saved on lodgings, she could use as additional spending money, he said. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food or strict check-in/out times either. I agreed that it was an option, but told him that I\u2019d talk it over with my sister first. While I knew that she\u2019d love to have more money to spend on merch or clothes, she probably also wanted a trip without any of her family breathing down her neck.\n\nWhen talked to my sister though, she was furious. I tried explaining myself, but she wasn\u2019t happy (understatement) that I was messing with her plans. She\u2019d already booked her hotels/bnbs and now she had to jump through hoops to cancel and refund everything. My apartment was too cramped and too far from where she wanted to go. She\u2019d be wasting her supposed savings on traveling. My apartment is a little tight for two people, yes, but we could probably manage. Still, I saw her point. So I said that she didn\u2019t want to stay with me, I would be glad to help her find arrangements when she arrived and keep it a secret. But then she blew up, said she had enough and yelled that there was no point in her going if people kept messing with what she wanted to do.\n\nMy parents called the next day to say that her trip was cancelled. She didn\u2019t want to go anymore and no amount of convincing or itinerary changes would change that. I feel awful because she\u2019d been looking forward to coming here for years. I wished that I\u2019d helped her push to stay where she wanted instead of making it seem like I agreed with my dad. Her lodgings probably weren\u2019t the only things they argued with her about, but me interfering was probably the last straw.\n\nI\u2019ve tried calling her, but she won\u2019t pick up my calls. Our brother says to leave it, her mom has been cycling being mad at her, my dad, or me, and my dad says she\u2019ll get over it eventually and was being a brat.

I think it is best to give her space, tell her she can still go if she decides that she wants again and that she is free to plan it as she'd like. It's her money she is spending, her life and one day no one has  say in it anymore. She is 22 and old and wise enough to decide it all on her own. Just be supportive instead of controlling :)", "NTA.

Your other sibling is right, just leave her alone.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t understand all the Y T A verdicts. All you did was talk to her, as you were asked to.\n\nShe as an adult was more than capable of saying no, and leaving it like that.\n\nThat she didn\u2019t, and went off cancelling everything and ended up cancelling the trip altogether is probably why the rest of the family didn\u2019t want her traveling alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She said she was more than willing to do exactly that. However, Parents won't let her stay where she wants or do what she wants on a trip on which she should be able to do exactly that. She made her plans and had to have her parents and sister still butting in on every decision. If the gift comes with so many strings, I don't blame lil' sis for saying, \"fuck it.\"", "I'm talking about your reply. You say that there's so many strings attached to the trip but the only string attached was having a check-in phone call. OP, the big sister living in Japan was literally willing to lie to the parents and let the little sister do whatever she wants. The only times she ever even gave her opinion was about suggestions on which spots to visit and the check-in phone call. \n\nIf the little sister just lied and said \"Yes\" or just ignored what her parents said (since OP said little sis already paid for where she was staying, which means little sis likely already had the money from the parents) then she could've had her trip the way she wanted and her parents wouldn't even know. How would they know when OP is literally covering for her?", "All the god damn strings are all the no's she got when she planned the whole trip. Where she wanted to stay was not good enough and what she wanted to do. Why are you not comprehending that her parents are the assholes and her big sister helped enable their asshole behavior by going behind her sisters back? OP has admitted to this now in her comments. She should have told her parents to back off and give lil' sis space to be an adult."]}
