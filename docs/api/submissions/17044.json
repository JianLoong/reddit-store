The issue is we prefer a quiet house, the toddler stage was unbearable, and even our oldest likes the quiet. We want our home to be a calm, relaxed place.

A crowd of loud teenage girls is my idea of hell. It was hell in school, and it's hell 20 years later. I understand where you are coming from.\n\nBut YTA.\n\nYou are neglecting her needs, and this could end up with her being shunned by her other friends as she's not able to reciprocate their invitations. It doesn't have to be every weekend. It can have specified start and finish times. There can be ground rules about noise and acceptable behaviours. But you need to extend your home to her friends on occasion.\n\nBoth of your kids need the freedom to express who they are in their own home, not just the one who takes after you.", "So you don't support your younger daughter's social needs in order to support everyone else's needs.\n\nYou can handle it being noisy for a few hours.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIntroversion does not mean that can't have social skills. I am sick and tired of other introverts using their introversion as an excuse.\n\nYou are actively failing your daughter as parents. Does she need to have friends over every day? no. But never? Come on!\n\nYou are being selfish and you are not supporting her needs.", "YTA. Never? Not an occasional limited number of friends? Not if they stay in her room or a specific area of the house? Everyone else vanishes to their rooms leaving her nobody to small talk with and you wonder why she is barely speaking to anyone in the home? Her social needs are not being supported.", "YTA\n\nSo instead of her disrupting your lives a few times a year, she has to completely change who she is to satisfy your needs. Wheres the fairness in that?", "YTA. Have you and your husband tried therapy? There\u2018s introverted and needing quiet, but to need quiet 24/7 and never allowing your other daughter to have friends over is not normal or healthy.", ">\tWe\u2019ve explained that it would be too disruptive to the rest of us, and we want peace of mind in our home. She called us selfish, and even called us a bunch of shut-ins.\n\nYTA, she\u2019s right, you *are* being selfish. \nYou are obviously aware that your youngest daughter has different needs socially than the rest of you, and you admit that you need to meet them\u2026as long as it doesn\u2019t impede on your own needs/wants. \n\nSuck it up and let her have a sleepover every once in awhile. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d even need to hover over them, let them sleep over and plan some things they can do on their own. They can watch movies, have snacks, order pizzas, whatever. You can just retreat like normal and let them do their thing.", "YTA- there is no balance going on here. She can NEVER have friends over?? That\u2019s frikin\u2019 weird & going to be noticed by her friends & their parents. This could cause social issues for your daughter & trust me, ppl will connect dots & make assumptions about why you don\u2019t let anyone come over that will be way worse than the real reason\u2026. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it needs to be a free for all where her friends are over constantly, but you seriously can\u2019t let her have some friends over like once a month?? There is a lot of middle ground between no friends ever & all the friends all the time. Get creative. Maybe it\u2019s 2-3 friends, not all 8 at a time to help mitigate the noise. Have your other daughter & one parent leave & go chill somewhere quiet while they are over & switch which parent leaves each month. \n\nYou haven\u2019t even tried to comprise or figure out how to meet this socialization need of your daughter\u2019s just because it doesn\u2019t align with what YOU want/ need- that\u2019s lazy parenting. Do better.", "Info: Is bimonthly twice a month or once every two months? \n\n( Editted after OP response YTA for only caring about your own needs and thinking 6 days a year is enough sacrifice for your own child )\n\nIt feels very unfair to say you can have your house the way you want 359 days a year \n\nAlso the disgusting way you talk about the issues she.brings being extroverted and how hard it was in the toddler stage. You never make an effort to actually spend real time being social with her, you lock yourself in your rooms \n\n\n\n\nYou chose to have a child. Grow up and put them first", "YTA she\u2019ll be moving out eventually anyways, let her have her fun. you\u2019re restricting her social life, just suck it up for a day", "YTA - She\u2019s not bringing home friends everyday. Besides, you have no idea of the value of networking. Allow her to hone her skills on that. And what happens one day when you have grandkids? You\u2019d also keep your in-laws and grandchildren from staying at your house?", "Unquestionably YTA. You brought her into this world, and she had no choice in either that or in being extroverted. \n\nYou\u2019re denying her something that is pretty normal for kids to have, just to suit your own preferences. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking for a friend to move in, just to occasionally have friends to stay over. By denying her that, you are saying that the house has to suit your preferences 7 nights out of 7, even if that means suiting her preferences 0 out of 7.\n\nWould it really *kill* you to let her have friends stay over one night every month or couple of months? \n\nYou need to sort this out, otherwise she is going to grow up thinking her older sister was the favourite, and that her wants and needs are invalid or lesser.\n\nEdit: And I say this as a massive introvert myself.", "YTA. First, her friends (or more likely their parents) will get resentful that invitations are not reciprocated.  Your daughter will be/probably is resentful that she can\u2019t have friends over. Second, It is selfish to let your own discomfort and limitations, hinder and limit your daughter\u2019s social life.  \n\nI speak from experience.  My mother was an OCD neat freak who didn\u2019t let me have friends over. Resentments build.", "YTA. 4/5 of our family is this introverted. We still encourage the extroverted one to have friends over because, shocker, *they are part of the family too* and get to do things that they enjoy at home as well.", "YTA\n\nGuess what's going to happen in 4 years? She's going to leave and you'll be posting here \"Why doesn't my younger child (F 18) want any contact with us?\"\n\nBut maybe you'd consider that a positive - one less person to have to interact with...?", "YTA and you\u2019re not doing your other daughter any favours either by not pushing her out of her comfort zone once in awhile and letting her just \u201cvanish into our rooms after school/work\u201d.\n\nLike no family activities or anything?", "YTA. What works for me. Doesn't mean it works for you. Think about your youngest's needs.", "Yta- your daughter has needs too and your desire to have \u201cquiet\u201d can survive a few hours of teens hanging out in a space. They don\u2019t run around that much and if you have a basement make it a comfortable place for her and her friends to hang out. Stop thinking about yourselves and start thinking about what\u2019s best for your daughter and not just a \u201ccalm\u201d space that doesn\u2019t work for everyone.", "Yes, YTA. You can deal with one or two kids coming over every now and then. You sound like an unsupportive parent.", "yta I'm intorvert3d as well but I don stop my kids from.being able to have friends 14 doesn't need constant supervision. do better", "YTA.  Setting limits would be a reasonable compromise - maybe something like up to 3 friends can come over for afternoons until dinner 2 days a week, and one overnight per month, with the possibility of having the whole group for special occasions if she asks in advance.  With that many friends, the group should be able to move around to other prople\u2019s houses enough to let you have your house mostly peaceful and quiet without preventing her from having normal social experiences.  Not being able to reciprocate as host will hurt her social standing and her place in the group,", "YTA there is such a thing as compromise, its utterly unfair she cant have friends over cuz the rest of you are shut ins\n\nShe should get 1-2 days a week where she can have friends over and you all just deal with it, instead of her dealing with you lot 24/7 7 days a week\n\nAnd as parents you gonna have to shut yourself less in, your daughter needs attention, sacrifices should come from the parental side snd not from 1 child all the time", "YTA. This does not sound like a healthy atmosphere. You need to teach your children to socialize or at the very least not stand in their way. This is an important skill in life even if you don\u2019t think so.", "YTA.\n\nYou are neglecting your youngest daughter\u2019s needs. \n\nBy all means, set limits on how many people she can invite over and how often, but she\u2019s absolutely correct to say that you\u2019re being selfish.", "YTA. I am an introvert as well and speaking from that perspective. However, what you are telling your daughter is that her needs will *never* be met in your household, and that she will always be the one expected to make sacrifices for everyone else. The rest of you can, every once in a while, can give up your quiet and isolation to show your daughter that you understand her needs and love her. Instead, you are telling her, because she is different, that she will never have her needs met by the family, and that the family will never take even one step out of their comfort zone to help her. Family (and relationships in general) needs to make sacrifices both ways. \n\nIn short, in talking about your needs for a \u201cquiet house,\u201d you are being selfish and are *not* being supportive of your daughter, whose only crime is being born different from the rest of you.", "YTA - and your update makes you even more of an asshole.  You see it's an issue and *maybe* you'll try bi-monthly. You can't even commit to that because you're so selfish really?", "YTA- you don't seem very supportive of your youngest daughters needs. I'm sure you guys can all survive having a few people over for a few hours. Your daughter will resent you for this", "YTA - peaceful, quiet is not being introverted. You\u2019re being extreme here.", "YTA - This isn\u2019t healthy behavior. I\u2019m also an introvert, I also like quiet time. But that can be interrupted from time to time, and I like to have a few close friends I really like. Being an introvert doesn\u2019t mean being friendless, it just means needing more alone time to recharge after being social. I think you and your husband might have a deeper issue, or you both put off working on a core issue until it got out of hand.\n\nPart of being a family, or living with anyone, is compromise. Y\u2019all should be able to compromise one day out of the week where you let your youngest have her friends over. You\u2019d still have *six* days to recharge. That\u2019s more than reasonable for standard introversion, and if that doesn\u2019t seem like enough, then are there any other stressors in your lives that make that seem unbearable?", "Somebody\u2026 bimonthly?  \n\n\nAhahahah. Like it\u2019s a scheduled controlled appointment. Talk about sucking the joy out of the extroverts life. \u201cI am allowed one friend over to play, once a fortnight\u201d does not for a happy extrovert make.   \n\n\nYTA.   \n\n\nTake some time to read up on child development\u2026 and I get it\u2026 you are a household full of introverts and your daughter is the anomaly, but she\u2019s a kid, who has developmental needs, and you need to push yourself out of your comfort zone more than three hours a fortnight to accommodate that. I\u2019m not talking about turning your house into the local community drop in centre, but she needs to have confidence that she can have a few different friends over, at a few different times.   \n\n\nI live in a house of deep introverts (code for a solid touch of ASD level of introversion) and have a monkey extrovert boy\u2026 and we have to find ways to connect with everyone and look after everyone. It is exhausting for me, and drives me bananas, but if I meet this need of his then he grows into a healthy, capable young lad. If I don\u2019t he\u2019ll likely have serious issues, with me, or with others.", "YTA.... You are not giving her a home, you're giving her a prison!", "Soft YTA, there\u2019s a difference between being introverted and needing a completely quiet house 24/7. She wants to invite her friends into her world, and in the kindest way possible her friends might be questioning or judging her for why they aren\u2019t allowed over. They don\u2019t need to be there all the time but you\u2019re depriving her of letting her show her friends how she lives", "YTA... And I thought I was the TA because I sometimes say no to spontaneous classmate's visits. I am also very introverted and don't like to have strangers in my house but my daughter is also a social butterfly and I love to see her happy and thriving, so I suck it up, put my headphones on and bake cookies for her and her friends. This is also her home, her room and she deserves to enjoy it with her friends from time to time.", "Jesus this is an overkill\n\nYTA \n\nLet your daughter have a friend over it doesn\u2019t need to be a bunch of people but come on. Suck it up.\n\nBimonthly is some BS do better.\n\nAlso sick of this I\u2019m so introverted/extroverted crap.", "You are selfish", "YTA. Firstly, her needs matter too. Secondly, you're being incredibly rude; if your daughter is invited places, she needs to be able to reciprocate the invitation. You're actually jeopardising her social life here. Frankly I cannot understand why you opted to have children if you wanted your home to be a 'calm, relaxed place'.", "Bimonthly?\n\n\nAs in 2x a month or 1x every 2 months? Because the former is super limited. The latter is just manipulative. Just like \"I'm throwing you crumbs, better be grateful!\" And someONE?", "\u201cThe toddler stage was unbearable.\u201d\n\nGod damn, I wouldn\u2019t trade the time with my 3 year old for anything - all the emotions included. It\u2019s simply amazing and it hurts my heart to hear somebody say kids they brought into them world are \u2018unbearable.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re totally TA", "YTA. While she doesn't have to have friends over every day, you should be able to allow her to have friends over maybe one day a week, for maybe up to 4 hours. You can also ask her to entertain in her room, which is usually what kids this age want to do anyway, and if she needs the main family room, the rest of you can stay in your rooms.\n\nIt IS selfish to refuse to let her ever have friends over.", "YTA let her have the experience kids need with there friends, friends are important whether you realize it or not. you need to let her live her damn life, sorry if it disrupts your \u201cpeace\u201d but it\u2019s part of having kids.", "YTA. I'm autistic and really hate having people in my space but I allow my kids to have their friends over fairly regularly. It's a lot for me because they're still in primary school and very energetic and loud but it makes my kids so happy that it is worth my discomfort. I would never push my desires or needs onto them. As parents we should support our children and encourage them to flourish even if it causes us discomfort. You and your husband enable each other so you think your behaviour is warranted or justified but you are wildly in the wrong here.", "YTA man. Just cus you don't see the necessity for friends doesn't mean your daughter has to be the same. To be honest being sociable and forthcoming is desirable in the working world. Doesn't seem like you should have had kids if you wanted them to be unsociable like you.", "YTA You don\u2019t sound supportive at all. It\u2019s your daughter\u2019s home too. She should be able to fulfill her needs. Not allowing her friends around, or only bimonthly is unreasonable. Being introvert, which I am too, is not an excuse to treat your daughter this way. Find a compromise.", "YTA she lives there too.", "LMAO.\n\nWhat cracks me up is that you complain about how 'unbearable' she is but then get mad that she stops talking to you...\n\nYTA, obvs, and I say this as an introvert myself.", "YTa\n\nShut in nails it.", "YTA \n\nSo you get to Re-energize all afternoon and evening and over weekends but she only has the opportunity to do so when going to someone else\u2019s home? \n\nHow is your home her safe space?\n\nETA: so to a teenager who literally sees days and weeks as a much much longer time you\u2019re saying they can have people over once every two months? What\u2019s wrong with you. \n\nParenting is not about putting your own needs above your children\u2019s.", "YTA. That must be a horrible environment for a normal person to have to grow up in. Even prisoners get visitation rights.", "YTA, that poor girl.

She must be so lonely.  This isn't just cruel, this is downright neglectful. No wonder she is on her phone all the time. She's 14. She needs her family.  Since she doesn't get that, the least you can do is let her have some other company. If you are all in your rooms, a few teenage girls shouldn't disrupt you that much. YTA.  My teenage girl had a bunch of friends in her room all the time. I never saw them - in fact they didn't want me there.

I don't know, something *reasonable*. You're isolating your daughter in her own house and it's cruel. \n\nInfo - can she get to her friends houses easily, or does it require a lift from you? If it requires lifts, do you give them? If not, you're actively isolating her.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that she may experience love in a different way from you. When you're not locking yourself away from your teenager to avoid the noise, do you ask about her friends? Life? Hobbies? Do you engage with her?

I don\u2019t mind being by myself. My husband is opposite but doesn\u2019t get as many opportunities as he would like due to being busy with work. We have two girls and when they ask to have friends over I used to drag my feet and wouldn\u2019t contact the parents until last minute because I was coming to terms with having other people in my home.

Outside my family I maybe have two friends and I don\u2019t converse with them often. It\u2019s a boring life and I want better for my girls. \n\nSo, I suck it up and deal with it. Keep it in mind that it is temporary and the loudness will cease when the friends go home. The kids birthdays are 5 days apart and we just had two weekends in a row where we had 6-10 kids sleepover. It was LOUD! Sounded like elephants were running upstairs and I was definitely afraid of a noise complaint from neighbors when my oldest and her friends were in the pool in the evening.

I\u2019m an introvert, too, or at least mostly (I do have friends and I socialize with them, just not often). My 19 year old son is a social butterfly. He has friends over probably once a week, and he also goes to his friends\u2019 places during the week. When his friends are here, they typically take up the living room and kitchen areas. It\u2019s loud, they\u2019re gaming, sometimes there are random food deliveries coming ringing up on my phone (we live in an apartment and my phone is connected to the intercom). I stay in my room, mostly. But when I do come out, there\u2019s a chorus of \u201chey Sam\u2019s mom!\u201d and some of them come and chat with me about school and work and whatever they\u2019re doing. One of them mixed me a rum and Coke a couple weekends ago (we are in Quebec, yes it\u2019s legal to drink at their age). \n\nYeah, they\u2019re in my space. But it\u2019s Sam\u2019s space, too. And he\u2019s a great kid, and his friends are great kids, too. Especially after the misery of lockdown, where I saw how badly his mental health was affected by the isolation\u2014when I hear them laughing and messing around, and see how pleased Sam is to have his friends over\u2014it\u2019s well worth whatever disruption to my quiet time. \n\nIt\u2019s as simple as this: My kid needs socialization to be healthy. I make sure to give him the space to do what he needs to be healthy. That\u2019s my job as his parent. I hope you\u2019ll find a compromise with your daughter. (Edited to add: bimonthly? Honestly?)", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have a big crowd over every day but maybe once a week your daughter could invite over a friend or two to hang out. It is her home too. Maybe she could host a movie or game day once a week or every other week. It would likely mean a lot to her and it isn\u2019t fair to say she never gets to have people over.\n\nI am an introverted person but that does not mean I never want to be around people. I would not want people over every day but once a week at a scheduled time would be fine.", "YTA and yikes.", "YTA. our family is quiet and prefers quiet. But I always encourage the kids to have friends over. I want our house to be a safe space where kids can hang out. Also, if they are at our house I know what they are up to!

Doesn\u2019t seem healthy to me.", "YTA", "YTA\nI really don\u2019t understand, why it is impossible to compromise. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you say, okay on e.g. mondays/Saturdays(idk, pick any day(s))I\u2019m busy anyway, you can have friends over but they have to leave by the time we have dinner. The other days we would like quiet. \n\nThat way you can plan and she gets what she wants.", "YTA. You are putting your daughters emotional and social needs subservient to yours when you could find a way to meet both.", "YTA ! WHEN she cuts y'all out of her life will you even miss her , or will you be relishing the silence?", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re trying to punish her for being extroverted. By not allowing her to have friends over, you aren\u2019t meeting her needs. Of course it doesn\u2019t have to be all the time but maybe a couple times a month you could let her have friends over. By not allowing her this, this may cost her invitations to her friends\u2019 houses and ultimately her friend group.", "YTA kids need socialization. you\u2019re isolating her from her peers. Don\u2019t be the weird house that never lets anybody come over.", "As an introvert, huge YTA. You\u2019re ruining your daughter\u2019s social life simply because you don\u2019t know how to cope with your introversion. I have friends who are extroverts! Sometimes they can be a bit much! But I still love them enough to accompany them to a noisy bar once in a while! Or suck it up and attend a party they throw where I will (shudder) have to make small talk with people I barely know. I may despise it but I still do it. You know why?! Because I care! I care about them and their happiness! And if it makes them happy, I will put myself in an uncomfortable situation once in a while, because they matter to me! And guess what, this has not only earned me friends who\u2019ve been in my life for years, it\u2019s also earned me some new ones who I unexpectedly ended up bonding with on a variety of topics!\n\nWhy can\u2019t you do that for your own blood?!", "I think you are not being very willing to compromise here, so YTA.  Other responses here have detailed better than what I can additional reasons as to why I share this judgement.", "YTA \n\n14 years old usually don\u2019t \u201c run around the house \u201c\nGet girls pizza and gossip place, they will watch a movie and giggle.\nI am introverted but that\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nI would be worried about oldest daughter more. It sounds bad she doesn\u2019t find socialising fulfilling. One thing being an introvert and enjoy small number of good friends, another is be antisocial and not enjoy human interaction. It also can mask what she doesn\u2019t know how to interact with people and prefer to pretend she doesn\u2019t need it", "I've always been somewhat introverted.  But when my daughters were teenagers, it was impossible to keep other kids away, so there was little to no point in trying.  At times, there were other kids all but living with us.  Then the last one went off to college and it was suddenly peaceful.  Quiet.  nothing.....\n\nShe's 14.  You have at most 4 years to put up with it and it will all be gone.  Just... deal.", "Easy YTA. From one introvert to another, seems like you prefer a quiet house more than you love your daughter.", "Umm YTA and you\u2019re taking the \u201cintroverted\u201d definition way too far here. Shutting yourself away from your entire family every waking moment that you\u2019re not at school or work and having 0 friends is a mental illness, not a personality trait.", "YTA and need to consider your daughter more or this will create a distance between you guys and her sister.", "\"She can spend all day making small talk\"\n\"Now she barely talks to us\"\n\nYou didnt fucking want her talking to you!! You can't have it both ways.", "You're setting yourself up for having a daughter that wants to get the hell away from you as soon as she's old enough.  Let her be her and suck it up.  Parents have to do that from time to time.", "INFO: why does it bother you that she's barely speaking to you? Isn't that what you prefer as an introvert?", "bimonthly is not enough, it\u2019s almost rude to the friends who do host her all the time", "Yta. Why did you guys have kids if you hate kids?", "YTA even with the update. You STILL don't care about your daughter's growth as a human being. You just got publicly shamed into doing the right thing.", "YTA. Please stop treating your youngest like a problem child who was only born to wreck your peaceful existence and get yourself and your partner some therapy.", "Even with the update, you\u2019re still in the wrong. Wdym \u201cbimonthly\u201d?? She should be able to have her friends over at her own home, and not have to do it on a super tight schedule.

There's a difference between not having a ton of friends and not having any and rejoicing in her lack of relationship making skills. They're failing both daughters, in my opinion.", "Excellent answer.  Add in the thought that if they are ok with an introvert basically punishing an extrovert for being one, is it ok for an extrovert to be penalised for being an extrovert.  \n\nThese introverts seem to be disguising some of their self serving/selfishness as introversion.  :(", "Teenage girls aren't nearly as loud as they used to be, nor are they as loud as younger kids. Also, compromises can be reached.  \nWhen my own youngest was in elementary school, she had a friend who was really sweet but extremely loud. He became an 'outside friend'----they would play at our house when the weather was nice and could be on the playset, ride scooters, etc. They would play at his house when the weather was inclement. His mom had several other boisterous kids and it was an arrangement that worked for everyone. Occasionally he'd be in the house, but since those times were few and far between they were tolerable.", "Agreed. I am an introvert, and I not only did I survive my siblings' friends coming by, I also love having my friends over. \n\n I get that interaction can be draining OP, but the kid is fourteen! You don't have to watch them like a hawk, they'll hang out peacefully at that age, just check in once or twice. And the oldest can perfectly ignore them.", "Also as a parent I think it\u2019s a good idea to have your kid\u2019s friends over. It gives you an idea of who they\u2019re hanging out with and just to stay in the loop of the kids\u2019 lives.", "Yea, you just know that OP\u2019s kid is known for having the weird family that never lets anyone come over.

At 14 you're not running round the house making a mess.", "That's bordering on antisocial. Also, way to shame your teenager for having friends.

I'm an introvert, too, but OP's YTA on this, big time.", "I know adult women--in their 40s now--who were never able to have friends over (in one case it was due to a level of untidiness they found embarrassing), and it leaves a trauma.", "Every other month. And it's not just how I want it, it's how three people are more comfortable.", "I bet she'll be moving out as soon as she possibly can. A 14 yo who isn't allowed to have a friend over is extreme and puts the kid in a difficult social position during a socially difficult time of life.", "They already hated their own kids as toddlers.

That's just the way we're wired.", "The way people on reddit confuse introvert and misanthrope is wild.

Coming from a formerly sheltered and now mostly introverted woman, YTA. You're not doing either of your kids any favors by doing what you're doing. I was and am like you and your SO and daughter, grew up sheltered with an introvert mom, but even I realize the importance of socializing and human connection now. I just do it in moderation and in places I enjoy. Clubs? No. Book stores, movie theaters, and cafes? Heck yes, sign me up! Being an introvert doesn't mean closing yourself off from the world. Maybe you need to get out more and experience more to see where your daughter is coming from. The way you all act isn't healthy.", "If it is to be fair, wouldn't it be she can only have friends once every four days? That way, everyone gets a day in the house when it's about their preference. \n\nAlso, I 100% don't believe a therapist worth a penny would say that a child/teen that has and wants no friends at all is fine. That's not introversion, that's social isolation. I believe you've made you eldest feel that having no friends makes her better, like you, and you didn't manage to make your youngest buy that garbage. You don't sound like a good parent to either of them.", "One friend every other month is not even a compromise. You are failing your daughter. \n\nShe's 15. She is learning about the world and her place in it. \n\nShe's learning that her sister's needs are the priority. And unforgivably, you seem to think your **wants** are a priority over her needs! \n\nYou will not be her priority when you need her later in life. \n\nDo better. Let her have a couple friends over every other weekend. Use headphones and stay away from them if it bothers you that much. You can manage to have a couple girls over 2 days a month.\n\nShe is for sure already getting social backlash for this.

When does she get to be comfortable at her house?", "And you other daughter\u2019s needs just don\u2019t matter. This is not a majority rule situation.

You're giving her 1. If it's how 3/4 are more comfortable....give her 15 days a month.", "christ. as an introvert myself, this just sounds utterly fucking miserable. I feel sorry for your younger daughter. clearly you and your husband should not have had kids if this was how you were going to be as parents.

That's still incredibly unfair.

OP - take the lesson, or you risk quashing your child's happiness, and losing your child when they are 18.\n\nI suggest therapy because your inclination (\"*No visitors even though you want friends over*!\") is really....self-focused, and you need to think about your young teen above your desire to read a book by yourself.", "Fair. I have trouble believing OP is a parent with 2 kids. I was raised by my dad, and while he was a real hard ass sometimes, the needs of my sister and I were always prioritized over his.

He prefers to be alone in his room but gets together with them or talks while playing video games a few times per month. I am not worried because he is introverted. \n\nBut having NO FRIENDS is a problem. My guess is the therapist said she doesn't like any kids from school but is open to being social with those who have similar interests. \n\nHopefully older daughter will find her people in college, work, or some other future thing, even if it's just a few."]}
