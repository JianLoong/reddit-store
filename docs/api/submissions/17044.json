A crowd of loud teenage girls is my idea of hell. It was hell in school, and it's hell 20 years later. I understand where you are coming from.\n\nBut YTA.\n\nYou are neglecting her needs, and this could end up with her being shunned by her other friends as she's not able to reciprocate their invitations. It doesn't have to be every weekend. It can have specified start and finish times. There can be ground rules about noise and acceptable behaviours. But you need to extend your home to her friends on occasion.\n\nBoth of your kids need the freedom to express who they are in their own home, not just the one who takes after you.", "So you don't support your younger daughter's social needs in order to support everyone else's needs.\n\nYou can handle it being noisy for a few hours.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIntroversion does not mean that can't have social skills. I am sick and tired of other introverts using their introversion as an excuse.\n\nYou are actively failing your daughter as parents. Does she need to have friends over every day? no. But never? Come on!\n\nYou are being selfish and you are not supporting her needs.", "YTA. Never? Not an occasional limited number of friends? Not if they stay in her room or a specific area of the house? Everyone else vanishes to their rooms leaving her nobody to small talk with and you wonder why she is barely speaking to anyone in the home? Her social needs are not being supported.", "YTA\n\nSo instead of her disrupting your lives a few times a year, she has to completely change who she is to satisfy your needs. Wheres the fairness in that?", "YTA. Have you and your husband tried therapy? There\u2018s introverted and needing quiet, but to need quiet 24/7 and never allowing your other daughter to have friends over is not normal or healthy.", ">\tWe\u2019ve explained that it would be too disruptive to the rest of us, and we want peace of mind in our home. She called us selfish, and even called us a bunch of shut-ins.\n\nYTA, she\u2019s right, you *are* being selfish. \nYou are obviously aware that your youngest daughter has different needs socially than the rest of you, and you admit that you need to meet them\u2026as long as it doesn\u2019t impede on your own needs/wants. \n\nSuck it up and let her have a sleepover every once in awhile. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d even need to hover over them, let them sleep over and plan some things they can do on their own. They can watch movies, have snacks, order pizzas, whatever. You can just retreat like normal and let them do their thing.", "YTA- there is no balance going on here. She can NEVER have friends over?? That\u2019s frikin\u2019 weird & going to be noticed by her friends & their parents. This could cause social issues for your daughter & trust me, ppl will connect dots & make assumptions about why you don\u2019t let anyone come over that will be way worse than the real reason\u2026. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it needs to be a free for all where her friends are over constantly, but you seriously can\u2019t let her have some friends over like once a month?? There is a lot of middle ground between no friends ever & all the friends all the time. Get creative. Maybe it\u2019s 2-3 friends, not all 8 at a time to help mitigate the noise. Have your other daughter & one parent leave & go chill somewhere quiet while they are over & switch which parent leaves each month. \n\nYou haven\u2019t even tried to comprise or figure out how to meet this socialization need of your daughter\u2019s just because it doesn\u2019t align with what YOU want/ need- that\u2019s lazy parenting. Do better.", "Info: Is bimonthly twice a month or once every two months? \n\n( Editted after OP response YTA for only caring about your own needs and thinking 6 days a year is enough sacrifice for your own child )\n\nIt feels very unfair to say you can have your house the way you want 359 days a year \n\nAlso the disgusting way you talk about the issues she.brings being extroverted and how hard it was in the toddler stage. You never make an effort to actually spend real time being social with her, you lock yourself in your rooms \n\n\n\n\nYou chose to have a child. Grow up and put them first", "YTA she\u2019ll be moving out eventually anyways, let her have her fun. you\u2019re restricting her social life, just suck it up for a day", "YTA - She\u2019s not bringing home friends everyday. Besides, you have no idea of the value of networking. Allow her to hone her skills on that. And what happens one day when you have grandkids? You\u2019d also keep your in-laws and grandchildren from staying at your house?", "Unquestionably YTA. You brought her into this world, and she had no choice in either that or in being extroverted. \n\nYou\u2019re denying her something that is pretty normal for kids to have, just to suit your own preferences. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking for a friend to move in, just to occasionally have friends to stay over. By denying her that, you are saying that the house has to suit your preferences 7 nights out of 7, even if that means suiting her preferences 0 out of 7.\n\nWould it really *kill* you to let her have friends stay over one night every month or couple of months? \n\nYou need to sort this out, otherwise she is going to grow up thinking her older sister was the favourite, and that her wants and needs are invalid or lesser.\n\nEdit: And I say this as a massive introvert myself.", "YTA. First, her friends (or more likely their parents) will get resentful that invitations are not reciprocated.  Your daughter will be/probably is resentful that she can\u2019t have friends over. Second, It is selfish to let your own discomfort and limitations, hinder and limit your daughter\u2019s social life.  \n\nI speak from experience.  My mother was an OCD neat freak who didn\u2019t let me have friends over. Resentments build.", "YTA. 4/5 of our family is this introverted. We still encourage the extroverted one to have friends over because, shocker, *they are part of the family too* and get to do things that they enjoy at home as well.", "YTA\n\nGuess what's going to happen in 4 years? She's going to leave and you'll be posting here \"Why doesn't my younger child (F 18) want any contact with us?\"\n\nBut maybe you'd consider that a positive - one less person to have to interact with...?", "YTA and you\u2019re not doing your other daughter any favours either by not pushing her out of her comfort zone once in awhile and letting her just \u201cvanish into our rooms after school/work\u201d.\n\nLike no family activities or anything?", "YTA. What works for me. Doesn't mean it works for you. Think about your youngest's needs.", "Yta- your daughter has needs too and your desire to have \u201cquiet\u201d can survive a few hours of teens hanging out in a space. They don\u2019t run around that much and if you have a basement make it a comfortable place for her and her friends to hang out. Stop thinking about yourselves and start thinking about what\u2019s best for your daughter and not just a \u201ccalm\u201d space that doesn\u2019t work for everyone.", "Yes, YTA. You can deal with one or two kids coming over every now and then. You sound like an unsupportive parent.", "yta I'm intorvert3d as well but I don stop my kids from.being able to have friends 14 doesn't need constant supervision. do better", "YTA.  Setting limits would be a reasonable compromise - maybe something like up to 3 friends can come over for afternoons until dinner 2 days a week, and one overnight per month, with the possibility of having the whole group for special occasions if she asks in advance.  With that many friends, the group should be able to move around to other prople\u2019s houses enough to let you have your house mostly peaceful and quiet without preventing her from having normal social experiences.  Not being able to reciprocate as host will hurt her social standing and her place in the group,", "YTA there is such a thing as compromise, its utterly unfair she cant have friends over cuz the rest of you are shut ins\n\nShe should get 1-2 days a week where she can have friends over and you all just deal with it, instead of her dealing with you lot 24/7 7 days a week\n\nAnd as parents you gonna have to shut yourself less in, your daughter needs attention, sacrifices should come from the parental side snd not from 1 child all the time", "YTA. This does not sound like a healthy atmosphere. You need to teach your children to socialize or at the very least not stand in their way. This is an important skill in life even if you don\u2019t think so.", "YTA.\n\nYou are neglecting your youngest daughter\u2019s needs. \n\nBy all means, set limits on how many people she can invite over and how often, but she\u2019s absolutely correct to say that you\u2019re being selfish.", "YTA. I am an introvert as well and speaking from that perspective. However, what you are telling your daughter is that her needs will *never* be met in your household, and that she will always be the one expected to make sacrifices for everyone else. The rest of you can, every once in a while, can give up your quiet and isolation to show your daughter that you understand her needs and love her. Instead, you are telling her, because she is different, that she will never have her needs met by the family, and that the family will never take even one step out of their comfort zone to help her. Family (and relationships in general) needs to make sacrifices both ways. \n\nIn short, in talking about your needs for a \u201cquiet house,\u201d you are being selfish and are *not* being supportive of your daughter, whose only crime is being born different from the rest of you.", "YTA - and your update makes you even more of an asshole.  You see it's an issue and *maybe* you'll try bi-monthly. You can't even commit to that because you're so selfish really?", "YTA- you don't seem very supportive of your youngest daughters needs. I'm sure you guys can all survive having a few people over for a few hours. Your daughter will resent you for this", "YTA - peaceful, quiet is not being introverted. You\u2019re being extreme here.", "YTA - This isn\u2019t healthy behavior. I\u2019m also an introvert, I also like quiet time. But that can be interrupted from time to time, and I like to have a few close friends I really like. Being an introvert doesn\u2019t mean being friendless, it just means needing more alone time to recharge after being social. I think you and your husband might have a deeper issue, or you both put off working on a core issue until it got out of hand.\n\nPart of being a family, or living with anyone, is compromise. Y\u2019all should be able to compromise one day out of the week where you let your youngest have her friends over. You\u2019d still have *six* days to recharge. That\u2019s more than reasonable for standard introversion, and if that doesn\u2019t seem like enough, then are there any other stressors in your lives that make that seem unbearable?", "Somebody\u2026 bimonthly?  \n\n\nAhahahah. Like it\u2019s a scheduled controlled appointment. Talk about sucking the joy out of the extroverts life. \u201cI am allowed one friend over to play, once a fortnight\u201d does not for a happy extrovert make.   \n\n\nYTA.   \n\n\nTake some time to read up on child development\u2026 and I get it\u2026 you are a household full of introverts and your daughter is the anomaly, but she\u2019s a kid, who has developmental needs, and you need to push yourself out of your comfort zone more than three hours a fortnight to accommodate that. I\u2019m not talking about turning your house into the local community drop in centre, but she needs to have confidence that she can have a few different friends over, at a few different times.   \n\n\nI live in a house of deep introverts (code for a solid touch of ASD level of introversion) and have a monkey extrovert boy\u2026 and we have to find ways to connect with everyone and look after everyone. It is exhausting for me, and drives me bananas, but if I meet this need of his then he grows into a healthy, capable young lad. If I don\u2019t he\u2019ll likely have serious issues, with me, or with others.", "YTA.... You are not giving her a home, you're giving her a prison!", "Soft YTA, there\u2019s a difference between being introverted and needing a completely quiet house 24/7. She wants to invite her friends into her world, and in the kindest way possible her friends might be questioning or judging her for why they aren\u2019t allowed over. They don\u2019t need to be there all the time but you\u2019re depriving her of letting her show her friends how she lives", "YTA... And I thought I was the TA because I sometimes say no to spontaneous classmate's visits. I am also very introverted and don't like to have strangers in my house but my daughter is also a social butterfly and I love to see her happy and thriving, so I suck it up, put my headphones on and bake cookies for her and her friends. This is also her home, her room and she deserves to enjoy it with her friends from time to time.", "Jesus this is an overkill\n\nYTA \n\nLet your daughter have a friend over it doesn\u2019t need to be a bunch of people but come on. Suck it up.\n\nBimonthly is some BS do better.\n\nAlso sick of this I\u2019m so introverted/extroverted crap.", "You are selfish", "YTA. Firstly, her needs matter too. Secondly, you're being incredibly rude; if your daughter is invited places, she needs to be able to reciprocate the invitation. You're actually jeopardising her social life here. Frankly I cannot understand why you opted to have children if you wanted your home to be a 'calm, relaxed place'.", "Bimonthly?\n\n\nAs in 2x a month or 1x every 2 months? Because the former is super limited. The latter is just manipulative. Just like \"I'm throwing you crumbs, better be grateful!\" And someONE?", "\u201cThe toddler stage was unbearable.\u201d\n\nGod damn, I wouldn\u2019t trade the time with my 3 year old for anything - all the emotions included. It\u2019s simply amazing and it hurts my heart to hear somebody say kids they brought into them world are \u2018unbearable.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re totally TA", "YTA. While she doesn't have to have friends over every day, you should be able to allow her to have friends over maybe one day a week, for maybe up to 4 hours. You can also ask her to entertain in her room, which is usually what kids this age want to do anyway, and if she needs the main family room, the rest of you can stay in your rooms.\n\nIt IS selfish to refuse to let her ever have friends over.", "YTA let her have the experience kids need with there friends, friends are important whether you realize it or not. you need to let her live her damn life, sorry if it disrupts your \u201cpeace\u201d but it\u2019s part of having kids.", "YTA. I'm autistic and really hate having people in my space but I allow my kids to have their friends over fairly regularly. It's a lot for me because they're still in primary school and very energetic and loud but it makes my kids so happy that it is worth my discomfort. I would never push my desires or needs onto them. As parents we should support our children and encourage them to flourish even if it causes us discomfort. You and your husband enable each other so you think your behaviour is warranted or justified but you are wildly in the wrong here.", "YTA man. Just cus you don't see the necessity for friends doesn't mean your daughter has to be the same. To be honest being sociable and forthcoming is desirable in the working world. Doesn't seem like you should have had kids if you wanted them to be unsociable like you.", "YTA You don\u2019t sound supportive at all. It\u2019s your daughter\u2019s home too. She should be able to fulfill her needs. Not allowing her friends around, or only bimonthly is unreasonable. Being introvert, which I am too, is not an excuse to treat your daughter this way. Find a compromise.", "YTA she lives there too.", "LMAO.\n\nWhat cracks me up is that you complain about how 'unbearable' she is but then get mad that she stops talking to you...\n\nYTA, obvs, and I say this as an introvert myself.", "YTa\n\nShut in nails it.", "YTA \n\nSo you get to Re-energize all afternoon and evening and over weekends but she only has the opportunity to do so when going to someone else\u2019s home? \n\nHow is your home her safe space?\n\nETA: so to a teenager who literally sees days and weeks as a much much longer time you\u2019re saying they can have people over once every two months? What\u2019s wrong with you. \n\nParenting is not about putting your own needs above your children\u2019s.", "YTA. That must be a horrible environment for a normal person to have to grow up in. Even prisoners get visitation rights.", "YTA, that poor girl.

She must be so lonely.  This isn't just cruel, this is downright neglectful. No wonder she is on her phone all the time. She's 14. She needs her family.  Since she doesn't get that, the least you can do is let her have some other company. If you are all in your rooms, a few teenage girls shouldn't disrupt you that much. YTA.  My teenage girl had a bunch of friends in her room all the time. I never saw them - in fact they didn't want me there.

I don't know, something *reasonable*. You're isolating your daughter in her own house and it's cruel. \n\nInfo - can she get to her friends houses easily, or does it require a lift from you? If it requires lifts, do you give them? If not, you're actively isolating her.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that she may experience love in a different way from you. When you're not locking yourself away from your teenager to avoid the noise, do you ask about her friends? Life? Hobbies? Do you engage with her?

I don\u2019t mind being by myself. My husband is opposite but doesn\u2019t get as many opportunities as he would like due to being busy with work. We have two girls and when they ask to have friends over I used to drag my feet and wouldn\u2019t contact the parents until last minute because I was coming to terms with having other people in my home. But over the years I realized I was doing a disservice to my kids. I want them to be different then me. I want them to have friends and create lifelong relationships because I don\u2019t have that. Outside my family I maybe have two friends and I don\u2019t converse with them often. It\u2019s a boring life and I want better for my girls. \n\nSo, I suck it up and deal with it. Keep it in mind that it is temporary and the loudness will cease when the friends go home. The kids birthdays are 5 days apart and we just had two weekends in a row where we had 6-10 kids sleepover. It was LOUD! Sounded like elephants were running upstairs and I was definitely afraid of a noise complaint from neighbors when my oldest and her friends were in the pool in the evening.

I\u2019m an introvert, too, or at least mostly (I do have friends and I socialize with them, just not often). My 19 year old son is a social butterfly. He has friends over probably once a week, and he also goes to his friends\u2019 places during the week. When his friends are here, they typically take up the living room and kitchen areas. It\u2019s loud, they\u2019re gaming, sometimes there are random food deliveries coming ringing up on my phone (we live in an apartment and my phone is connected to the intercom). I stay in my room, mostly. But when I do come out, there\u2019s a chorus of \u201chey Sam\u2019s mom!\u201d and some of them come and chat with me about school and work and whatever they\u2019re doing. One of them mixed me a rum and Coke a couple weekends ago (we are in Quebec, yes it\u2019s legal to drink at their age). \n\nYeah, they\u2019re in my space. But it\u2019s Sam\u2019s space, too. And he\u2019s a great kid, and his friends are great kids, too.

A preference is not reason enough to deny your kid a normal social life.\n\nYour oldest may be ok, but she is wildly outside the norm in terms of socialization, even for an introvert. It's sad to me that you see no reason to encourage her to form any bonds at all given how valuable friendships are when life gets tough.

Every time I even asked my mother to go out and do something, she would fight me on it because she didn't understand why I needed to be so social and have friends.

Her home should be a safe space for her, but make sure she has the skills she may need in the future. \n\nIf she has something like autism where dealing with a roommate will adversely affect her studies (if she intends to go to college), you should get that documented so she can ask for room accommodations. First semester is not the time for her to be figuring that out. I know you said you had her see a therapist, but autism is often missed, especially in girls. When you describe the toddler stage as unbearable, what was it about that stage? If it was the noise and chaos, that goes beyond the two of you being introverts.

So, basically, your daughter will forever be comprising for the rest of you, and none of you will compromise for her ever.  It is excessive.

So this whole people coming over to homes things can be cultural. Some cultures just don't have people over and that's fine. But even within these cultures they compensate for that in other ways. There is nothing wrong with someone's home being a \"sacred space\" if you will. But by not opening it to outsiders, you will have to compromise in a different way. If your daughters friends can't come over, then you need to be willing to take your daughter and her friends places. \n\nYou might find, as an introvert, you would just prefer them coming over. Otherwise your are going to have to be more social by engaging with them in a public setting with more people. Because ultimately that is the problem here. It's not that you won't open your house to your daughters friends. It's that you are not actively engaging in an important aspect of her life. Where you engage doesn't matter as much as the actual participation. \n\nYour daughter needs to know that she is more important than your desire for isolation. No matter how you slice that, that involves taking time away from that isolation with her. Whether it's in your home, or out in the world. But if you are not willing to occasionally give up the peaceful sanctuary that is your home, you will have to find a different way. You all need to sit down with your daughter and discuss this.

My grandmother stopped even going to the store. They were scared and suspicious of our neighbors.

Kids are loud. And they\u2019re often annoying. Parenting is full of noise and inconvenience. It\u2019s just how it is.

I agree that OP is TA but my family (my parents and I) also kinda liked being alone and doing our own thing after the work/school day is done. I would usually go chill in my room, my dad would be in the office or dining room doing his hobby, and my mom in the living room. We had a small house so having all our own space is hard. We\u2019d eat dinner together and usually watch something after/during. I obviously still hang with my parents sometimes\u2026 we do stuff on weekends and whatnot. But I mean, it\u2019s not crazy to chill by yourself after school or work\u2026\n\nEDIT: I AM JUST COMMENTING ON THE FAMILY DYNAMIC, NOT THE FRIENDS THING! I know banning friends is fucked up. However, many commenters are also criticizing the fact that members of the family like alone time in their own house outside of dinner and watching TV. My family was like that too! We all just needed to recharge! The difference is I was free to have friends over if I wanted.", "I was trying to not be quite that cynical... but you're probably right.

Would make the process of cutting contact easier for her.", "And all that sounds great, but doesn\u2019t sound like what OP is doing. Out of curiosity, what did you do for the birthdays from ages 5-10?", "A fair point!", "It\u2019s possible she does actually have plenty of friends, they\u2019re just mainly online. The way her parents are they probably don\u2019t ask her about her friends - I know my parents used to constantly ask if I\u2019d be hanging out with people and doing things but if her parents don\u2019t ever hang out with friends of their own they probably don\u2019t put as much emphasis on it, and end up just assuming she doesn\u2019t have friends because she never talks about them or asks to have them over.", "I didn\u2019t want friends. My mom was always worried about me as a result, but I legit just wanted to be alone because I preferred it. It doesn\u2019t have to be that deep. Some people enjoy their own company more than the company of others. I spent all day in school surrounded by annoying, immature teenagers, that was enough socializing for me.", "none of us are the therapist or the daughter but I completely disagree with you on this. What would your solution even be for this? Force them to make friends when they dont want them? Why does wanting to have friends have to be the only acceptable behavior and everything else is something that needs fixing?", "You weren't wrong. Antisocial has multiple meanings. Most people use it to mean exactly what you said: not wanting the company of others. The vast majority of English-as-a-first language people will not understand \"asocial\" if you say it. \"Antisocial\" is the norm in common language and completely acceptable.\n\n>an\u00b7ti\u00b7so\u00b7cial  \n>  \n>adjective  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>contrary to the laws and customs of society; devoid of or antagonistic to sociable instincts or practices.  \n>  \n>**2.**  \n>  \n>**not sociable; not wanting the company of others.**", "Yeah introversion just means you recharge and relax better through alone time and extroversion means you recharge better with other people. Doesn't mean introvert don't like being social and doesn't mean that extroverts can't handle alone time", "Same! Although I think of myself as an extrovert/introvert. I can do both - because society requires it at times. But I prefer to keep to myself.", "I am exactly the same way. I'm pretty bubbly and animated. Was told recently told I've \"been known to run a room\".\n\nI love my friends and hosting and going to parties, but after a certain amount I need to hermit up in my room with swipey games and reality TV to recharge.\n\nNo one believes me when I talk about my introverted side.", "Same! I\u2019m really chatty and animated so no one ever believes I\u2019m an introvert, but alone time is a necessity.", "SAME! No one believes I'm an introvert. I'm very talkative at work and love hanging out with my friends but theres a treshold. I have a battery meter. I sometimes disappear for days to replenish said battery. After work, I'm so drained from talking and being around people, I eat dinner and lay around watching Dateline. It's my me time. Being an introvert doesn't mean we are antisocial or shy or a incluse. We just have shorter social batteries. It just means I need time out. My very best friend friend in the world is the opposite. High energy, super social, etc, even she doesn't notice if I 'disappear'. We're like sisters but she knows I like being alone after a lot of social stuff.", "Extroverts get their energy from being around people. Introverts get their energy from being away from people.

Even my husband knew that\u2019s what I needed before I even knew it myself.", "Oh, sorry if it came across as otherwise, I was totally agreeing with you!", "I read it as every other week too which seemed like a fair compromise to me. \n\nUnless it's a big weekend event then every 2 months is total crap.", "Biweekly/bimonthly is pretty ambiguous, but I think most people also think every two weeks/months.

I agree you should have unwind chill time and people need that. What OP is talking about is that literally zero people come to their house and they all have zero friends except the kid who actually likes people. It's fine to live how you want, but it's not cool to ban all of your children's friends from the house permanently because you're and introvert. That's just being a jerk", "Honestly, but it might be a bias, it's the fact they stay alone AND the \"drifting apart\" from apparently their entire social circle AND the part where they apparently don't ever invite anyone, to the point op didn't seem to expect her daughter to do that (which seem normal for a social teen?) that makes it a bit odd (even a tad concerning, but that's me being judgy).", "Yup. My dad is\u2026not a sports person. Has never cared about them in any way. But I am. He went to all my games, he took me to pro games, he even took me to the Women\u2019s World Cup! AND he would try his best to help me practice, even though he sucked and it wasn\u2019t very helpful practice, I sooooo appreciated him doing that because it was still much better than attempting to practice on my own (kinda hard when you\u2019re a goalie lol). My dad made so many sacrifices and did so many things he didn\u2019t care for at all, just to support me. And I fucking love him for it. He is an amazing father.", "I'd say you were lucky there. There are plenty of parents that put their needs/wants above their children.", "Seriously.  People are assuming so much here.  But I guess that\u2019s what this sub is for lol.  Kind of a live demonstration of why some people aren\u2019t that into socializing.  For whatever reason, a lot of people just can not stand when someone is a little different.", "Send them to a therapist who can actually suggest things for her to do to learn social skills, it's not necessary to make friends in life (if you wanna be completely alone you do you i guess) but the fact is we live in a society, and social outcasts often need a lot of luck and patience to navigate through adult life when they didn't learn how to socialize in high school. Can you live a life completely independent and without interacting with anyone else by having an online job? Sure, but until you do you are gonna need some social skills.", "The solution would be exploring her beliefs and feelings about herself and others. Is she intrinsically indifferent to social interaction, or has she had experiences in the past that inform her behavior now? How do social interactions with family or people at school make her feel? Can she imagine having a friend and what would that friendship look like? Are there activities that she thinks seem interesting that she hasn\u2019t explored? \n\nKids are social learners. It\u2019s quite possible that older daughter simply took on OP\u2019s socialization patterns, without ever questioning or exploring another way. Exploring these feelings and encouraging her to seek out new experiences, while provided bc support is the solution.", "I think what people might be trying to say is, not force her to make friends per say, but they're being poor role models and showing that it's okay isn't helping her with life skills. Kids reflect their parents to a point, and their one is leaning heavily into who they are. But that's just, only to a point. Their other daughter is completely different but, they're doing the antisocial one a disservice. \n\nYou can't force her to have friends but I think the biggest thing is that they also aren't helping her really prepare for life either if she seriously isn't practicing her social skills or attempting to learn how to navigate social situations at all. At least, that's what I'm seeing mostly from other comments.", "And you really need to learn how to build a support system. You don't need to have 8 best friends, but you really need to at least one or two solid people that you can help or be helped by when things are rough.", "That's what I found, thanks for quoting. It's all got very confusing so I'll leave it as it is \ud83d\ude05", "right I'm from the UK and have never heard the word asocial before today", "Exactly this!
