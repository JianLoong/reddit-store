I still can't get over it and I DONT wanna apologize but another family gathering is approaching and I want to see if I'm being unreasonable. Let's preface this with one thing. I'm black they are white and it plays a role in this. So he has a younger sister \"daisy\"  who does pranks for tiktok and is trying to grow a following. Her persona is basically like a cute girl version of Dennis the menace. My hair is pretty long, and for Christmas it was braided with red and green extensions that were the same length as my hair. So daisy waited until I fell asleep to sneak into the guest room and snip off the braids and left them on the pillow. Apparently the prank was that I'd freak out and think the house was haunted (she had been telling me spooky things about the house but she's a kid so I just humored her.) I did NOT think the house was haunted... I screamed SOMETHING BIT THROUGH MY HAIR! I freaked out upon learning that she had cut it for a prank and her parents told me to calm down. She said that if it upset me that much, she'd reimburse me the hair. I asked if she had 3 years because that's how long it took to grow. She thought it was all fake, claims it was just a joke and the parents agree. I'd like to mention that she and I got along great for the whole time we've known each other and her other pranks were only mildly annoying. So I tell her not to post the video and I ask her parents what they're going to do. Short answer? Nothing. So I stormed out. My bf followed me and we went to a hotel and left the next day. His family is split with his parents and sister saying I over reacted and him and his cousin and aunt saying they need to get a hold to her behavior.", "created_utc": 1673675546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bgxg9/aita_for_leaving_christmas_over_a_prank/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you have kids with your bf, you\u2019ll get the last laugh when you just can\u2019t seem to find a convenient time for them to visit.", "Oh sorry, NTA, obviously. Cutting somebody's hair while they sleep isn't a prank, it's just cruel. Your reaction is more than justified.\n\nBut... I just have this mental image of somebody waking up in that scenario and yelling out \"a fucking goat bit through my hair!\" and it's pretty hilarious, not gonna lie.", "In all honesty you weren\u2019t and aren\u2019t being unreasonable. His sister is an AH and his parents are enablers. She\u2019s going to \u201cprank\u201d someone and either get her ass beat or get her and her parent sued.", "Harsh, yeah, but honestly that would have been my reaction too. Possibly unpopular opinion but this kid needs to learn that actions have consequences, and just because she did it for tik tok doesn\u2019t make it ok. Probably good you scared her a bit.", "Im gaslighting no one. I gave my opinion on the info presented. Black folks dont own braided hair. So unless there was something else, this was just a really stupid prank.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d it's not", "Nope he never brought it up again, but when I bring it up he listens to my rant", "Interesting! I'll check out Hair Tales, thanks", "Yep, I\u2019d group report that shit.", "This. Right here. Report her account.", "If she is that makes me a really bad person... I hope not", "I agree with the idea of a letter. But also, don't be surprised if it makes no difference. The disconnect that made it possible for this girl to think it okay to cut your hair and her parents to cosign it, is a massive failure of empathy. We can hope that the parents get a clue. But if they didn't have one to start with, it's not likely to happen.\n\nAnd frankly, I have no problem calling this kind of behavior racist. Because it is.", "That response was... embarrassing but it was the last thing I expected to happen \ud83d\ude43", "Why not both?", "There is something else. It's got nothing to do with who owns braids. She told you there was. White people act crazy around my hair on the regular. And when I tell the stories, white friends are shocked out of their minds and can't understand 'how someone could do that'. And 'why do i think that person did that?' \n\nDealing with racism and racial nonsense regularly allows you to see the patterns of behavior that give you a sense when something has a racial component and when it doesn't. That's what I'm saying. Unless you're an expert in anti-blackness, yours is insufficient to judge in comparison to her own assessment, is what I'm saying.", "I personally wouldn't ever want to be around those people again", "Ugh I am sorry.  I think he should say something.  Maybe he just doesn\u2019t know what to say.  The family should be ashamed as well.  I would die if one of my sons pulled a prank like that.", "No, it doesn't.", "She cut off your hair that doesn't make you a bad person", "You were assaulted while you slept. Go to the cops.", "If there is something else, then more info should be given as the op said \u201cit plays a role in this\u201d. From the info given alone, I dont see how.", "This. If this is the behaviour they condone, you're better off alone.", "I said I'd smack the grin off her face if she kept smiling", "Still does not make you a bad person. If she is challenged or not, it's her parents responsibility to teach her that what she is doing is completely wrong which is not what they are doing. They are enabling her bad behaviour. So she clearly sees nothing wrong with what she's done. \n\nYou are absolutely justified with how you reacted."]}
