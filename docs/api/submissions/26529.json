Anyone who says you went too far hasn't been in your situation.  The constant annoyance when you're awake is bad enough, but sleep deprivation is a serious health and safety concern.\n\nI lived in a two family on the first floor. Upstairs were three 20-something women on the lease, but anywhere from 6 to 10 living there.  They partied 5 to 7 nights a week.  Started upstairs from about 9 pm until 11 or so.  Then, the dozen or so partners would stomp down the stairs to hir the bars.  They returned after the bars closed and partied until dawn.\n\nAsking them to quiet down only made it worse.  The landlord was very understanding, but eviction where I live typically takes a year or more.  Their lease was up in 2 months, and she agreed not to renew.\n\nSo for 2 months, whenever they partied, at 8 am, I set my speakers on top of a chair on top of my dining room table.  I put on a rock/blues oldies station, turned the volume all the way up, and went out for the morning.

Even outside of \"quiet hours\" most people do, in fact, have the legal right to \"peaceful enjoyment of their living spaces\", which means that in congregate living settings like apartments, there is still a requirement to not be so loud that other people cannot relax peacefully in their homes.
