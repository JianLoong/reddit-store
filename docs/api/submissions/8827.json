He told me that I should have told him I have a two seater. I said that he never told me anyone else was coming and also this is just my car now. I said that his friend could take an Uber where we were going and I'd send him the money. My friend just looked upset and the guy looked awkward.

Your friend made the situation really awkward when it didn't have to be.", "NTA. I'm just sorry you offered to pay for this random third person as they are not your responsibility.

I don\u2019t even really feel bad for your friend, but damn if I were Jake I\u2019d have been so uncomfortable, not to mention the offer to pay for just Jake to get an Uber instead of your friend and Jake to meet you there is a little odd. Like it made it clear you didn\u2019t want Jake to be there, which fair enough, you didn\u2019t want him there, but if your friend is always inviting other people out with you guys I think you should have talked to your friend about it ahead of time instead of making it clear you didn\u2019t want Jake there.", "Jake from State Farm", "I respect the petty\n\nI\u2019m guessing op got a brz, but would love to hear he got an [nsx](https://youtu.be/1es3eRv3K5Y)", "It\u2019s not Jake\u2019s fault that their mutual friend is inconsiderate.", "So OP has to tell his friend the kind of car he's driving to accommodate the people his friend invites without his knowledge?", "I agree with you about jake, but OP clearly has boundaries , which he should've spoken to his friend about. \n\nI don't think OP didn't want Jake there.

Personally, I don't know his friends tone, but if someone was saying, \" Why didn't you tell me you got a two seater?\"Where is Jake going to sit?\" I would've gotten irritated.

The OP was under no obligation to let his friend know that he traded his car for a two seater but it would've been courteous to have let the OP know that another person was coming too.
