She doesn\u2019t get to set rules and boundaries about YOUR house. I bet her psychiatrist doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s living there rent free. Ask if you can accompany her to a session one day.", "Nooope nope nope. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s omitted a WHOLE lot when talking to her psychiatrist. I can\u2019t stand people co-opting terms like \u201cboundaries\u201d to try to force others to behave in certain ways. That is NOT a boundary. A boundary represents a standard of acceptance, and if your \u201cmessy home\u201d isn\u2019t meeting her standard, she can enforce her personal boundary by finding somewhere else to stay. Your answers to any requests that represent a change to your lifestyle and standard of living should be nope, no thanks, sure! you can do more cleaning, and/or there\u2019s the door. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t even get involved with going to a psychiatrist with her and giving any credence to her \u201cboundaries\u201d bullshit. Her poor kids. NTA!", "NTA and good on you for offering to go with her to therapy (to see what was REALLY said LOL).\n\n1 adult versus 1 adult + 3 tiny humans is a HUGE difference on wear/tear/cleanliness of a house.\n\nEat whatever you want in your house.  Wherever you want.  Good luck making it until September without more fireworks!", "NTA.  Either your sister, her therapist, or both don't quite seem to have grasped the concept that boundaries are about what the BOUNDARY-SETTER will do/not do or stay in the presence of/leave the presence of.  They are responses to the behavior of others, not a proscription as to how others should behave.\n\nI get that changing her kids' diet is tough if you're eating food the kids would prefer and they see it...but managing that kind of situation is parenting.  This is not a 'let's share things and build something together' situation.  This is a one person assisting another and the second person does not, in fact, get to make rules for anyone except her kids.", "NTA. \nHas she told her psychiatrist that she's living in your home without paying rent? Once she has her own place she's free to set all the boundaries she wants. Until then, she doesn't get to dictate where you eat, what you eat, or who's responsible for cleaning up after her and her kids.", "NTA. Your sister is welcome to start a clean eating plan. She\u2019s welcome to set up a chore chart for herself and her kids. She\u2019s even welcome to sit down with you, as the adults in the house, to discuss a fair allocation of chores to keep housework under control. She\u2019s not welcome to dictate **your** behaviour or criticise the state of your house (particularly when her family forms 4/5 of the residents, and - with three kids - probably more than 4/5 of the mess!). If she doesn\u2019t like her living situation in your house, then she can choose to leave and find something else. If she wants to stay, then it\u2019s time for her to start respecting YOUR boundaries for a change.", "NTA. When her name ends up on the deed/mortgage or rental agreement, then she can set the rules up. Otherwise, she needs to respect you and your home or go find somewhere else to live. It sounds cruel but it is absolutely fair.", "NTA. While I think you doing *some* chores is reasonable, it seems clear that there's a lot more cleaning to do with your sister and her 3 kids around, so the 4 of them should do the bulk of the cleaning. I don't see how she can control what or where you eat, though. I'm assuming there are other \"boundaries\" she is creating as well. While I think living with 4 additional people (3 of whom are children) is definitely an adjustment that may require some slightly different habits, I don't think you should have to drastically change your routines just because your sister said so (unless your routines involved something that was actually harmful to the children in some way).\n\nThat being said, I think it's commendable that your sister is going to a psychologist, and I think you should take her up on her offer to accompany her to her appointment. That way, you can set the record straight about what's going on, and maybe even let her hear from her psychologist that she needs to be more reasonable about her expectations when living rent-free in your house.", "NTA She can not dictate how you're supposed to live in your own home when she and her children are staying with you rent free waiting for housing. Life doesn't work that way. It not her home, she's a guest.", "NTA- I do get the feeling these rules might be ones SHE came up with on her way home from her visits rather then her psych telling her they are ok.\n\nShe doesnt get to tell you what foods can be eaten in your house. Nor does she get to tell you what chores you have to do.", "BOUNDARIES?\n\nWho\u2019s her therapist, Jonah Hill?\n\nNTA (LOL)", "NTA\n\nIts your house and you were being charitable helping her. Time for her to pack up and leave", "NTA, as you\u2019re doing her a huge favor, and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re asking for much more than common courtesy in return. \n\nBut it actually might be a good idea for you to go to a therapy session with her. It\u2019s possible that she\u2019s been giving a distorted account of events to her therapist.", "NTA: I'd simply ask the question, 'if I have to come live in your house, am \\*I\\* then allowed assert my boundaries?'\n\nFile this under \"no good deed.'", "NTA.  You\u2019re doing her a favor.", "NTA. She can set her boundaries in someone else's home. This psychologist sounds like a quack.", "NTA\nYour house, your rules. She is imposing enough on you by living with you and bringing 3 kids into your home. If she can\u2019t be grateful for the shelter you\u2019ve provided, F her. You have every right to live in your home the way you want to, and you shouldn\u2019t have to eat fast food in your car. You were right to tell her to tell her to go live in a homeless shelter or go live with her psychiatrist.", "NTA\n\nBoundaries are \"the thing I won't do\".  They aren't something you can project on to other people.", "NTA", "Bravo!  NTA", "YES. NTA. I love it when an OP means what they say and says what they mean.", "NTA.\n\nI think, conceptually, the idea of people being firm on their boundaries is a good thing.  However you then get people like this who call things boundaries, when its really expecting people to bend to their will.", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules. Eat as much fast food as you want.", "NTA tell her she can knock it off or move out early.  She can find her own home to live in if she wants to try and dictate what people do in it.  If that means her and her kids become homeless because she can't respect the fact someone is doing Her A FAVOR well too bad so sad, maybe the object lesson will sink in.", "NTA", "NTA", "Bossy big sister here says NTA. My younger sibs have no problem telling people where the line is drawn, and for that I take (partial) credit. Growing up with 6 siblings all of whom are management material gives you strong boundaries. Tell her!", "NTA, your home your rules. And yes it is most defined the kids fault. I only have one kid but I had no idea how much dirt one kid can cause. I am vacuuming just to turn around and being able to vacuum again. It's really frustrating", "Soooo NTA! Your sister either needs to find other accommodation or stop lying to her psychiatrist about where she\u2019s living (I guarantee you she says she owns the place and you do nothing: classic projection) and stop trying to force her stupid rules onto you. Put your foot down because it\u2019s ultimatum time.", "Woweee.  NTA.  I think she left out some key facts when she spoke to her psychiatrist.  Ie your house, rent free.  How do boundaries with food and chores help with her mental health?  Oh NM.  Love the bit where you have to go see her psychiatrist hahaha.  I\u2019d have all her shit packed up in the driveway.  Feel bad for the kids though.  They need some stability.  Edit to ask:  does she work or pay for groceries?  I find your sisters way of thinking fascinating.  In a laughable way.", "NTA. As Inigo Montoya said \"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\" Boundaries aren't for controlling how other people live in their own houses. \n\nAlso you're working & she isn't. She should be doing the majority of the cleaning as a favor to you while she's staying there & to clean up after the kids. \n\nAs for the food I can understand her take if you're eating fast food in front of the kids. Diets are tough enough to stick too so she's less of an AH on this point.", "NTA.  It's your house.  Time to show her your boundaries...and the door.", "NTA", "NTA.  I have a feeling she won't be enforcing no bonderies in the local homeless shelter though.", "NTA\n \nYou are her host, not her tenant or child.", "NTA\n\nHer therapists know only what she tells them. She might feel like a servant but as you say her family is making the mess. To set her straight they need your side.  I do get the food thing though. Do you have an office or a place in the house you can eat fast food not in public. Can you eat it where you are picking it up? I have a grandson that when he is visiting I have to play those games. But as you have been doing tell her you are setting your boundaries for her living in YOUR home.", "NTA. Kick her out as soon as possible. Your sister is unhinged. Kicked her out now. Don\u2019t hold back please.  Oh and \ud83d\ude1d", "My, my, my. NTA\n\nScrew her shrink and her boundaries. Bring home fast food and eat it in front of them. Every. Single. Day. \n\nBonus points if you throw the wrappers on your own floor.", "INFO: How old are the kids? Are you or are not still living in the house? If you are, why should you not also do chores with the other people living there? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be read between the lines here, and it currently reads like you\u2019re TA. You use \u201cpsychiatrist\u201d like it means \u201ccrazy\u201d, and give zero detail.", "NTA, but, if your sister is doing better. Would it kill you to go along until she moves out?
