She was adopted by a very nice couple I met briefly. \nWhen I was 20, I married my husband (not her father) and now have a happy life and three children: \u2018Norah\u2019 4f, \u2018Jaxon\u2019 3m, and \u2018Rosie\u2019 1f. \n\nThis year over the holidays, I received a phone call which turned out to be my first daughter (\u2018Taylor\u2019 8) parents. They explained they had told Taylor she was adopted and now she wanted to see her \u201cfirst mommy\u201d (how she refers it). \nI was kind of touched she wanted to meet me, but I associate Taylor with an abusive time in my life, her birth father was not exactly someone close to me, and I knew if I saw her all I would think about was that. I declined Taylor\u2019s parents.\n\nLater on I told my husband and he says I should have reached out to my daughter, he said if he had had a baby put up for adoption he\u2019d want to meet them immediately. I told him I didn\u2019t want to, we don\u2019t have the same wants and it\u2019s not his daughter so he doesn\u2019t get a say in it anyway. Besides, he knew about the trauma and knew how guilty I always felt about leaving her, but I can\u2019t see her. He kept disregarding my words and kept insisting I meet Taylor.\n\nI admit I used choice words with him and wasn\u2019t kind after that but now he\u2019s all on Facebook and telling people how awful I am, and I feel awful about it, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t clarify, I didn\u2019t say I never wanted to see her, I declined seeing her at the moment. I want to sort out my trauma before seeing her and I told the parents such. It might take years but I may want to see her someday. \nAlso, could you stop calling her bio father my ex? He\u2019s really not\n\nEDIT 2: since many asked, I have asked Taylor\u2019s parents if I might write her a letter (not with all the details) instead and perhaps write each other occasionally.

You might also want to talk to a psychologist about how old a child should be before such a meeting should take place and under what conditions.\n\nYour husband has been monstrously cruel to bring your private trauma to a social media platform.  There could be no benefit at all from doing so other than to cause you and your children pain.", "NTA-when you give up a kid, you use that moment to put specific boundaries in place, and currently, there's a boundary that now is not the right time where you are comfortable in meeting her, your husband and anyone else involves needs to respect that and back off until YOU'RE ready to meet her and even if you're not ever going to be ready, it's still YOUR choice and it's still PERFECTLY OK.", "NTA. Right now you're not ready, and that's fine, and I actually applaud you for saying not yet, much better that than do it before you're ready and end up reacting badly, in a way an 8 year old can't process.

I just worry for you as this is horrible, and he is being horrible, not just by accident, but it is a long thinking process to publically shame your most private pain and personal history online. \n\nIf there is no underlying context, he needs therapy to learn how to interact with humans and treat his wife with respect, but if he can't stop asap and be a decent human, please know what he is doing is abusive and nasty and cruel and unacceptable to all other people.", "NTA.

It wasn't an easy decision, it was because we weren't in places mentally, emotionally or financially to be a parent and did made what we thought was the most responsible decision for the child by hopefully giving them a better life with people who wanted to be parents. Most of this we suffered alone, we often felt a lot of shame and didn't want people to know and judge us.\n\nSometimes we get another chance with that child. Quite often this brings back a lot of the trauma, guilt and pain we originally went through. And again we go through this generally alone because people are judgemental areseholes and can't fathom why anyone would give up a child. If we decide to make contact it comes with a lot of new decisions, such as what if the child wants answers or a relationship I can't give, or hurts me in new ways? If we don't make contact we go through more guilt knowing that the child was innocent and may deserve more from us.\n\nFor your partner to not only judge you for your decisions but advertise them publicly is a horrible breach of trust in your relationship. They haven't been through what you have. They have no right to share your story. Seeking judgement from others is so hurtfully disgusting I can't even imagine how you're going to cope with this.\n\nWhether you renew your relationship with your bio child is a decision you have time to make. You can prepare yourself for the day you can, or you can decide not to meet them. You can write them a letter. You can think about their relationship with your current children. The possibilities are endless. It is your decision to make though.\n\nWhat you do about your husband though is more concerning. He has shown you that he doesn't think you can make your own decisions. He is sharing you pain with everyone you know without regard for your feelings. He is inviting judgement without asking if you want people to know what you went though. I worry that this is only part of the contempt with which he treats you. You deserve so much better.\n\nYou survived a heart wrenching experience. You made decisions that noone should have to make hoping for the best for your child and yourself. You recovered trust enough to find a partner and get married. You became a mother to children who you adore and strive to make happy. You are far stronger than you know! I applaud you for the courage it took to go on with your life and make it better.\n\nNow I encourage you to have a cold look at your marriage and decide if its really a safe place for you. Does your husband treat you as an equal? Is he a good example of a father and husband to your children? Does he bring happiness and joy into your life? Wishing you all the best and know that you are strong enough to face whatever the next decision in your life is - you'll make sure its the best for all of you.\n\nEdited to add NTA at all", "NTA.

How could the women, the one responsible for my birth, the life I never asked for, do that? \n\nOf course now I understand how mentally ill she was and how she suffered (since I inherited the mental health issues) but it still makes me sad that the one person who could have walked me through those emotions and issues was gone. \n\nIt's heartwrenching and traumatic being adopted. I hate and love my bio mom. And it's so isolating knowing a lot of things about our personalities are nature and not nurture. \n\nI'm not making a judgement. Because I think I couldn't be impartial. You haven't done anything wrong, but so many wild things can happen that can ruin meeting in the future.

It was definitely a shock but a wonderful discovery for her to find us. Mom had told our Dad back when they first met so he knew already, he was supportive of everything she wished even keeping her secret from us when she wasn't ready to tell us. This isn't a betrayal or dishonest it was because he deeply loves and respects my mom. One really important detail is that Mom and my older sister didn't reunite until Mom was in her 60s. That's what I think matters, she had so much time to heal and grow. And no loved ones were passing judgement as though they somehow know better. You absolutely are not an asshole in any way.

Her choice might cause childhood trauma to an 8 year old that does not understand.", "There isn't an indication that happened", "OP, please don't let this or other comments further traumatize you. You did nothing wrong, and people who view situations like yours this simplistic don't have a true understanding of how trauma works.\n\nIf you can't separate your first child from the trauma, you absolutely did the right thing by putting her up for adoption and declining to see her. No child deserves to see their parent traumatized by their existence. That's not something the parent can control, and it will do serious harm to the child no matter how well it's handled or explained to the child.\n\nIf you have access to good mental health care, I'd encourage you to seek help to find additional healing since this is still having such a bad effect on you. If you're able, I'd definitely encourage that part of that healing being a way to provide some sort of contact or way to answer your first child's questions that won't further traumatize you or her. Doesn't have to be meeting, but even something like letter writing that is monitored and supported by therapists and her parents might help both of you with further healing and understanding. You shouldn't have to carry guilt over doing the absolute best you knew how to do by her and making sure she had nice, loving parents who could raise her.", "You did the right thing and you are continuing to do the right thing by not making that little girl see the truth in your face. I'm sorry this is so hard and I'm sorry so many people will judge you for it, but you're still doing the right thing.   \n\n\nLet her parents parent her. That is all.", "Either one of those is no bueno.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t know any men who would go to Facebook to post personal details like this.", "News flash everyone sucks sometimes. Get over your perfect self.", "Dont forget that she popped out kid number #2 within months of getting married so she was already knocked up before she turned 20.", "I mean, it sounds like a lot of abuse and possibly even rape was what led to the 8 year old existing, reading between the lines of what OP was saying. That would make the daughter literally the result of the trauma. So it's not surprising that she's a trigger for OP.", "Yea of course they do, but it is not bio mom's problem and frankly, none of her husband's business beyond knowing it happened.", "It\u2019s why I haven\u2019t met my birth-child as well. It is so painful having to cut that part off to try and stop the pain enough to continue living. I trust that I gave him the best chance I could, and that has to sustain me.", "\u201cOP was the adult when her daughter was born.\u201d OP was still a child herself.\n\n\u201cShe should attempt therapy and work through her trauma.\u201d She has. She is. The work is not yet done.", "Yeah, but exposing a little kid to an immediate progenitor who associates them with trauma and pain would be worse than not hearing from them at all.    \nOP did the right thing giving her first kid up for adoption. Adoption means that's not her kid anymore. The kid doesn't have two mommies. She has one mommy, the one who's raising her.", "She gave her up to a good family when she was born. She has no obligation to revisit the trauma of her past that led her to having this child. \nIt also probably would have been better on the adoptive parents side to wait till she was older to explain the adoption.\n\nNo matter what OP is NTA.", "Of course I knew who you meant. I was making a pointed statement that she is not a parent to that little girl, no matter what image the little girl has of her in her mind or what sort of connection the child has fantasized between them.   \n\n\nOnce you give a kid up for adoption, it's not your child anymore. You no longer owe that child anything, emotionally speaking, because it's not your child.   \n\n\nIt's the girl's parents' responsibility to deal with her emotional health, including the idea of \"first mommy,\" and any other imaginary friends the child may have as she grows up.", "She is not responsible of her feelings.", "The comment above said the OP would be TA if the adoptive parents already told Taylor she\u2019s going to meet her \u201cfirst mommy\u201d, but would not be TA if the adoptive parents haven\u2019t told her that. If the adoptive parents made promises they shouldn\u2019t have, that doesn\u2019t mean the OP is suddenly an AH. That\u2019s on the adoptive parents.", "What? This isn\u2019t just being a bit imperfect. This is next level betrayal. And she is likely trapped with 3 babies that young. It\u2019s near impossible to support yourself and your children as a single parent when you have 3 that close together and little", "Are you the husband lol", "She didn\u2019t disclose that, but when I went back to reread it, I can see how you came to that conclusion. If that\u2019s so, then I will delete my comment because I can see how it would sound insensitive.", "I didn't say OP was an asshole or not, because I don't think she is. I'm saying that her trauma is going to cause trauma to the child who wants to meet her birth mom. As someone else has pointed out in a different chain, OP should consider therapy to move past this.", "A child's mind is not cut and dry and does not follow the way of the law. The child may not legally be hers, but they still feel attatchment to ties that like. Comparing an adopted child's idea of their birth parent to an imaginary friend is reductionary and insensitive, considering the numerous studies conducted regarding adopted children's mental health. While OP isn't responsible for the child, and hense my refusal to call her an asshole, adopted children can and have developed trauma in this scenario. As I stated originally, I urge her to work past her trauma, so she doesn't inadvertently traumatize someone else.", "Wuss", "idk why hes so pressed,,, is he going around baby trapping woman?", "Ur mom's the husband", "Yeah, she didn't explicitly state it, but that's what I feel like she was implying in a roundabout way. Which is understandable, I'm the same when talking about certain things on the internet as well", "Personally it was inappropriate of the adoptive parents to tell the kid about her mom. They could have simply said theh don't know who it wss and then let the OP know so she wouldn't feel pressured and could take the time to work her way towards a visit when she was ready.", "I admit, it was a reductionist and insensitive comparison. Well put. I'm trying to be as unilateral as possible in stating that the child's mental health and wellbeing are truly and fundamentally *none of OP's business anymore.* Nothing the child thinks or says or wants can change that. Yes, the child's mental health and wellbeing are at stake. But that has nothing to do with OP as an actual living person, distinct from the fantasy of her that the little girl carries. It's all in the hands of the child's (adopted) parents.  \n\n\nThere's nothing good that OP can do for that little girl. If the child was made to come face to face with the reality that her own existence means nothing but trauma, pain, and victimization to the woman who bore her, would that make her feel better, do you think, or worse? Would the child benefit from being so brutally disillusioned as to see with her own eyes what she actually means to OP?   \n\n\nThe little girl was born by a woman who doesn't want to see her. That is a painful fact that the girl's parents will have to help her come to terms with as best they can. There's no sense in lying to the child, any more than you can lie to a child about death. Eight years old is not too young to understand.  \n\n\nYou seem to be operating on the fantasy that OP will possibly get enough therapy that she might one day come to love her first offspring and become that \"first mommy\" who loves you from afar that the child yearns for. But that may never be possible, and I say its best for the child's parents to brace the child for the likelihood that it won't be.", "Troll\u2026.", "I really appreciate you pointing that out. That\u2019s totally understandable, especially when someone is trying to protect their privacy. I feel terrible for not realizing how awful the entire situation was surrounding the birth, but it makes a lot more sense now.", "I certainly can't deny that, but cats out of the bag now. What I don't understand is why OP went for an open adoption if she had no intention of reaching out to the child.", "I'm certainly not asking for the mother to love her first born. I'm not even saying she is obligated to protect the child's feelings. If I meant either, I'd have called her an asshole and been done with it. It IS her decision. And her decision CAN affect a child's emotional state. Whether or not the child is hers or not, whether or not she has that responsibility, it still comes down to that. That's why I'm imploring her to reconsider. I don't want a storybook ending, all I want is this kid to have the best chance of coming out of adoption unscathed. \n\nI'm invested because I was adopted, I had my birth mother reach out. She ended up doing something terrible down the line that ruined any chance of us having a bond, but that she reached out to me helped me when I was coming to terms with the adoption at an early age. I have no ill feelings towards OP for what choice she ends up making.", "Kudos to you for being understanding once it was pointed out rather than doubling down on your stance. It seems to be a rare thing on this site", "That is fair. It is possible she wanted take sure that the child went to a good family.\n\nEdit: Or wanted the option to meet the child in the future if she thought she was over the trauma.", "So this isn\u2019t what would be considered an option adoption. Open adoption are adoptions that the bio parent is actively participating in.\n\nWhat most likely happened is that Op didn\u2019t close her information to the adoption agency. (Aka seal the info so the parents couldn\u2019t find her) and the adoptive parents probably just asked for her information. (Which they are allowed to do)", "Yes, I also fail to see why the adoption was not closed. OP hasn't given us any reason to think it shouldn't have been.", "Thanks so much. :)\n\nI really do try. I\u2019d hate to defend my stance when I\u2019m the one in the wrong- just feels so wrong to do that.", "She said in this post it was a hard no, and in a different comment chain expressed no intentions of reaching out when she was older, but she keeps contact with the parents directly, hense this whole thing happening. It's a weird duality here and I just can't wrap my head around it", "She did say in a chain that she's now considering writing her a letter after this post, which I really hope she goes through with. Even a letter would go a long way", "OP implies that she met the adoptees, and nothing mentioned implies that they got her info without her knowledge. While it's hard to say for certain what the original arangement was, situation points a lot more towards open adoption", "Yeah, I really don't understand people who do that. I'd say that being willing to change your stance and admit when you're wrong is one of the greatest signs of emotional/social(?) intelligence/maturity. So people who defend their stance when in the wrong are just a bunch of dummies"]}
