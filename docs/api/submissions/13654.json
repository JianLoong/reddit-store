But be smooth and authentic.\n\nWait, here\u2019s a much better suggestion: dump this creepy creature altogether. He will never change (trust me, he doesn\u2019t want to) because he has a seriously repugnant fetish. Men like this spend their lives causing chaos and conflict between the women (and close female relatives involved) they latch on to. I\u2019ve seen it happen. It\u2019s a sickness that compels these guys to fantasize about their girlfriend\u2019s female relatives, and then the fantasies become stronger over time. Then they\u2019ll start fights with the girlfriend, causing the predator to \u201cseek emotional shelter\u201d from the sister or mom or **gasp** grandmother. Quite systematic and predictable.
