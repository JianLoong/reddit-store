AITA here?\n\nEdit: just wanted to make a few things clear. The place had a dress code - Smart Elegant, so not really dressy and not too casual either.\n\nI wasn\u2019t asking her to specifically wear a dress, but just to dress a bit better. We live together and I know her wardrobe, and a dress is usually what she prefers to wear when she dresses up.\n\nI looked at a few posts and stories on their page, and in most of them the women seemed to be dressed up a bit. I did not want her to feel uncomfortable when we got there, as she\u2019s pretty self conscious.\n\nEdit 2: People asking me what I wore: I wasn\u2019t dressed yet, I usually wait until she\u2019s done. But anyway, I was planning to wear a polo shirt and a pair of chinos.\n\nEdit 3: she\u2019s not xenophobic or racist, I can vouch for that. Ignorant, I don\u2019t know.\n\nTo people saying chinos and a polo is not dressed up: This is in Dubai and the weather is insanely hot especially during the summer, wearing a suit is not an option and when you do, you look out of place.", "created_utc": 1685180475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t33tc/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_dress_better_on/", "score": 5648, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I chose a really nice Italian place and wore a cute dress, straightened my hair, put on makeup...

Whether that\u2019s racist or not isn\u2019t something that\u2019s the fault of one woman. It\u2019s the words OP used to categorise the restaurant to which he is taking her, or intends to. The vast majority of \u201cChinese restaurants\u201d in my country are buffets that source their ingredients from the same suppliers, and are of shabby quality, for example. That\u2019s not an attack towards Chinese people, culture nor cuisine. If you told me you\u2019ll take me to an \u201cAmerican restaurant\u201d, I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s just as trashy. OP never stated they were Americans, or even western. They could be Thai or Japanese. European or African. American or Latino. The only racism here is your assumptions and the fact that you can\u2019t look past your own nose to see that semantic categories, while maybe inherently prejudiced or racist themselves, are not necessarily expressions of personal prejudice or racism. Linguistic pragmatism is understanding things in context, therefore assumptions based on a broader category which harbours certain connotations, implications and meanings are not necessarily borne out of hatred, ignorance or prejudice towards the group which that category marginalises. It\u2019s a broader issue than that, and blatantly denying that and resting the responsibility on the interpreter rather than the one speaker, or the societal ignorance that has created the prominence of ignorant and prejudiced terms, is a safe way to make sure we can never get better as a society. Purposely acting ignorant towards the stereotypes invoked in certain phrases and semantic categories to judge others that interpret said phrases or categories, is just as damaging.", "No, trousers can be very elegant and fetching.

Either you already know about the place and then you'd know about the dresscode or you found the place somewhere and then surely you'd have read that information somewhere.\nI would find it very hard to believe that you'd go to a place so fancy that it requires you to dress fancy and that information just completely eludes you when booking.", "They said the dress code is smart casual when I made reservations", "Yeah. Totally. Just thought I'd share the info.", "Yes, because burgers is not an ethnicity or an entire cultural category of cuisine. This comparison makes no sense. Are you under the impression that all Chinese food is casual and cheap?", "Burgers are fast food.

Ethnically/nationally themed restaurants in my country are invariably shit. Tapas restaurants vs. Spanish restaurant. Sushi vs. Japanese. Pizzaria vs. Italian restaurant. I could go on.

Him for demanding she dresses fancier when clearly she didn\u2019t want to, and her for not even looking at the Instagram/deciding she\u2019d rather stay home at the last minute. Ultimately, what she was wearing was not going to prevent you from eating at the restaurant. And if she usually likes wearing dresses but today she didn\u2019t, you should respect her autonomy.

She doesn't have to wear a dress, but worn out jeans doesn't sound appropriate for this nice restaurant.", "YTA. One, you should have set the expectation when you first told her about the date, that fancy food = fancy clothing. This isn't always the case and needs to be clarified. Two, when you saw her dressed down, you immediately jumped to \"but you should wear fancier clothing/a dress\" instead of \"you normally like to dress up, is something up/are you okay?\" \n\nThe \"I don't feel like it tonight\" really sounds to me like she may have been not feeling well or on her period and wasn't feeling up to dressing up or being fancy. Sometimes it just is like that, especially if someone has painful periods!", "NTA. I think maybe it could\u2019ve been communicated better. She could just be feeling upset about something else so she didn\u2019t feel up to getting fancy, but she should\u2019ve communicated that. Also I understand OP\u2019s point.. if you\u2019re requesting to go to a fancy restaurant I\u2019d want my spouse and I to dress up for the occasion.

It's hard going in blind because some nights I think we're gonna have a chill time and we end up going out somewhere nice or something.\n\nAgain, I think it's iffy on her part and why she didn't dress up when she knew. If she was having a bad day - maybe she wasn't up for it and you guys could've worked something else out, but again, her saying \"it's just a Chinese restaurant\"...\nI feel like it's something you should talk about, maybe something was up with her or at least express why you're upset in the situation.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhere I live fancy Chinese restaurants are rare, but when you do go to one it would definitely be weird to show up in jeans", "YTA.

Especially if you don't know why. She could be self conscious or just generally not feeling comfortable in her body right now and by asking her to put on something fancy she might come to the conclusion that you want to police what she is wearing in general, which I'm almost certain wasn't your intention. This is especially important though when she usually has no problem or even likes dressing fancy. This may mean that something is bothering her right now and pressuring her on wearing fancy clothes might increase that issue.\n\nThe reason why it's a very soft YTA is because if it actually is a fancy restaurant she maybe wouldn't even get in with her chosen clothes. And some establishments just require a certain attire. She also apparently did snap on you which is something you need to talk about with her. Get to the bottom of the issue, but without putting any blame on her as that will just result in her shutting down even further. \n\nI personally think that the right course of action would've been to react differently to her choice of clothes, maybe ask if something is the matter, then inform her of the issue at hand without faulting her and then maybe suggesting going to a different place instead where she might feel more comfortable. \n\nHonestly though this also kinda depends on your tone of voice and on the actual clothes she choose.

If she doesn\u2019t want to go, she can tell him this rather than playing childish games and not even looking at his phone lol!\n\nIt\u2019s not his responsibility to read her fucking mind", "The fancy place has people wearing t-shirts on their social media.", "he reached out to friends in other states to see if they could help, but admits he didn't know if she would take the help.", "the bottom of the post has the last update. she ended up quitting because her career was basically in the toilet as a result of her actions. op also said her restaurant was partly owned by a Chinese investment company which was apparently part of why things blew up so badly for her at work.", "So confident but so incorrect too. Smugness is so unattractive.", "wow. op really was a saint. i would've just let her sink or float on her own after the bullshit she pulled.", "I read that, but it was also mentioned that he got her another job and she lost THAT as well? I read he reached out to contacts but nothing after that.", "NTA.\n\nIf you specifically are telling her to wear a dress, that\u2019s different. If you\u2019re simply saying you don\u2019t meet the dress code and it\u2019s embarrassing to go to an establishment with a dress code in ripped up jeans and an old T-shirt, NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go with my husband somewhere if he just refused to change into something appropriate. \n\nPeople get very triggered with men telling women what to wear, and in most cases they should be triggered as it\u2019s wrong. This isn\u2019t that. At all.", "NTA but this could have been handled a bit better.\n\nFirstly, I do agree that your gf was in the wrong by dressing way too casually for a more upscale restaurant (that you had given her advance notice for). However, when she expressed that she didn't want to get dressed up, you could have then suggested a change of venue or maybe ordering takeout instead. I know this is sort of frustrating if you have been looking forward to the restaurant, but sometimes, getting ready for women is a big undertaking that we don't have the energy for. And it's not necessarily about throwing on a nice dress. Her hair has to be done, and makeup to match. There is no worse feeling when going out than feeling 'incomplete' wearing a nice outfit but with no makeup on. And it becomes a whole thing sometimes because now she has to shower and dry and style her hair and etc. Even when she looks 'effortless', trust me, there is a lot of effort going on.\n\nPerhaps she should have communicated better that she would rather do that instead as well, instead of putting the burden on you to change plans to fit her mood that day.", "INFO: Why do you wait for your girlfriend to get dressed before you do? That's super weird. \n\nThere's a difference between getting ready at the last minute as many men do, but waiting for her to be ready before you get ready sounds really off my dude. \n\nStill, generally NTA. If a place is nice you should dress the part. She doesn't even need to wear a dress. Trousers and a nice top would work just fine. Seems really weird on her part.", "YTA only because you think chinos and a polo is dressing up. Wtf", "No, it doesn't matter on the place. If you've said it's a date night dress nice, then you both dress nice regardless of where you're going. Mutual respect", "Some ultra-casual spots in LA have valet because more people will come to your spot if they don't have to sweat parking. Just had it for strip mall KBBQ recently", "True. But since he didn't say dress nice I don't know why you bring that up.", "I got downvoted as well for saying she was being racist", "He said a polo and chinos in a recent comment!", "They do according to people who have actually been there.\n\nAlso some people obviously can ignore the dress code if they know the owners, have money money, are well known in the area/famous, or a combination! I\u2019m assuming the insta pic with people in them know the social media coordinator or owners and if not, could be anything tbh", "And yet anyone pointing this out gets told they\u2019re reaching. So stupid.", "Means the Same thing as put a dress on \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I remember that! And it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve tried to make homemade soup dumplings, it turned out ok but it\u2019s  hard to nail!!! Still nowhere near even a mid-level restaurant quality. The idea that he\u2019s not a real chef bc it\u2019s Chinese food is just ridiculous. Glad she got her just desserts (pun intended)", "So if the expectation is that she'll get dressed up and she doesn't feel like it she should've communicated that beforehand.", "in those specific cases yes, but ive seen stories in this sub, in offmychest and plenty of others where they make no mention of previous experiences and just want to talk about this one thing and people will hop on \u201cthats toxic leave\u201d train. if it wasnt so true then it wouldnt be such an ongoing joke that reddits first response to relationship problems is to leave \ud83d\ude02 this sub and a few others im in seem to have some weird rampant hate for single/step parents and guys its weird\nEDIT: either way to me shes TA for her weird racist undertone \u201cits JUST a chinese restaurant\u201d comment", "I grew up in a not great area and a lot of the clubs had rules like that and would let everyone know upfront that certain clothing-or colors-wouldn\u2019t be acceptable", "After the fact he said that, yeah. When she already had decided to not do it and when she already had the expectation that it wasn't necessary.", "Pretty sure if a western culture invented paper thin dumplings that held soup inside that cradled the meat, they\u2019d blast it everywhere up charge it and lose their minds over it. There\u2019s a lot of Chinese dishes with serious skills to make like soup dumplings, dragon beard candy, hand pulled noodles or peking duck but it\u2019s always mocked as cheap garbage and lumped with Chinese takeout. Pisses me off so much.", "Depends on the occasion and it depends on the jeans. Assuming \"business casual\" or \"smart\" then a pair of nice looking polyester \"jeans\" is probably fine, but denim jeans, especially those that are worn, probably aren't.  \n\nEdit: also depends on location, in the south the classic cowboy boots, blue jeans and button up flannel shirt will probably not turn any heads with a dress code below semi formal.", "Jeans with holes in them are not to be worn anywhere important.\n\nMate's house, sure. Work, no.", "He was going to wear a polo and chinos\u2026 a casual looks. What an idiot.", "Lol right? I've seen some jeans for sale that I would be embarrassed to even donate if they were mine.", "Because we read the whole post. That is how we know.", ">everyone should have autonomy over what they wear\n\nThat is what i was replying to.\n\nBut i guess not?", "It\u2019s possible the chicken feet is special order for a function.  Not everything cooked inside a kitchen is available on the menu.  A chef run kitchen can cook anything on special order by request.  As long as they have ingredients available in stock.", "She did tell him. She said she didn\u2019t want to dress up and then she was the one who canceled.", "Who cares? That\u2019s so not the point. OP wanted a nice date a place that\u2019s fancy to them.", "After getting pissed on her SO for no reason? Sounds reasonable lmao!", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying \u201cdress up, we\u2019re going somewhere nice.\u201d", "it seems like the modern mindset here is 'I did the bare minimum, praise me' and are upset that *literally any anywhere* could have standards.", "Where are you seeing the casual dressers on the IG?", "if she'd put a polo shirt and chinos on, or chinos with a moderately dressy top, or just a half-pretty comfy dress, I am sure he'd be okay with that. But a T and ripped jeans is streetwear.", "Don't know what you are looking at, but wore out jeans would have definitely stood out.", "This is in Dubai, the weather is too hot. No one wears blazers/jackets here during the summer months and it\u2019s summer now", "She was dressed? Lmao duh she wasn\u2019t gonna show up without clothes. OP is NTA if I told my bf I was hyped for a fancy place and he showed up in a tshirt id be bummed. Some people like getting dressed up, and while it\u2019s 100% okay if you don\u2019t if you partner expresses that the place they picked is fancy/ they want to dress up either say no right there or date someone else.", "Eh if my bf and I agreed to dress fancy and he showed up in a T-shirt I\u2019d be bummed. I\u2019d expect the same response from him. Now we usually like dressing up so that\u2019s just our vibe but I wouldn\u2019t expect to be treated w different expectations than I have for him.", "Because they communicated that it was fancy before\u2026 and the gf was fine with that before. If my bf and I had a fancy dinner planned and he shows up w a tshirt id be bummed and think wow he didn\u2019t care about a cute outfit even tho we discussed it.", "She is TA for a multitude of reasons:\n\n1. The 'just Chinese' comment, as though Chinese restaurants cannot be upscale, despite the OP explicitly indicating that it was? Racist/prejudiced at best.\n\n2. Dressing in a t shirt and worn down jeans despite partner dressing up to follow the dress code ('smart elegant') and explicitly being asked to dress up a little bit at least before hand. Shows lack of respect for your partner. If this was a woman dressing up nice and setting up a fancy date and her partner shows up in a t shirt and worn down jeans, vast majority of people here would think this is highly disrespectful no doubt.\n\n3. In the end, you can wear whatever the fuck you want at any time of the day. Just realize that an important part of being in a relationship is respecting your partner's wishes. If you find that you are ignoring their wishes often or they to you, then perhaps this relationship should end.", "He\u2019s not.. they communicated it was a fancy place before. If this was a girl being bummed about her bf wearing a tshirt and jeans while she had a dress you wouldn\u2019t have the same vibe.", "I wonder if it's possible that she has gained weight and is upset about it and nothing fits quite right. Sometimes people are really bothered by that but they don't say anything out loud.", "Hot models and actresses wear torn jeans and t shirts all the time.\nI'm sorry, but if you want to take me out ( I never asked) I have to dress to your standards? Yikes.", "You can see people do so very clearly in the instagram pics  just like you can see them wear t-shirts\nNot to mention you exoect your partner to drrss up while you are wearing chinos and a polo shirt - so basically off colored jeans and a t-shirt - and don't even bother to ask her *why* she won't dress up although she usually does for even going to a bar and things like that\nDo you even care about your partners feelings or do you only care about her looking pretty and you not being embarresed by her because she doesn't dress as fancy as the people in the instagram pictures.", "If someone said that about an Italian restaurant, pretty sure that would be messed up too. If someone equates the value of a restaurant with the ethnicity of the cuisine, that\u2019s xenophobic.", "That depends on where you live. Where I live, most fancy restaurants are okay with jeans because it is really hot and most people here are casual. Where OP lives and the restaurant in question have their own social norms and expectations.", "right, this guy waits until she's already dressed, and then starts talking about dresses and dress codes... if you want something to be done a certain way, state it clearly", "There's super fancy \"a dress is required\" and there's \"dress better than torn jeans and a t-shirt\" dressy and I think this was the latter. A nicer pair of pants and a top isn't too much to ask as it's basically the same thing regarding comfort. She was being defiant for some reason. OP needs to find out why. NTA", "It's after six. What am I, a farmer?", "It\u2019s a micro aggression but love it when people dismiss racism.", "Adding on to this, if she says she doesn\u2019t want to get dressed up you can pivot. Cancel the reservation and go somewhere more casual.", "He did answer and y\u2019all are reaching lol. Im sure he knows what his gf wears usually, I\u2019m assuming dresses are her go to when dressing up.", "A nice pair of ripped jeans and a tshirt is def comparable to polo and chinos lol I wore designer ripped jeans and a T and blazer last time I went to a high end dinner. Saw lots of women wearing the same typa thing", "To make it equivalent, the guys has to be wearing a tshirt and jeans. Anyway, every post I've seen on this sub where a woman was complaining about her boyfriend dressing casually everywhere, (some of them taking casual to ridiculous extremes), people took his side.", "And he had every right to refuse to go with her if she didn't want to dress up.", "Or staff meal. Sorry to say, sometimes the public doesn't get the really good stuff.", "So she should've communicated with him that she wasn't getting dressed up because the expectation was there."]}
