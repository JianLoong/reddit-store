Whether that\u2019s racist or not isn\u2019t something that\u2019s the fault of one woman. It\u2019s the words OP used to categorise the restaurant to which he is taking her, or intends to. The vast majority of \u201cChinese restaurants\u201d in my country are buffets that source their ingredients from the same suppliers, and are of shabby quality, for example. That\u2019s not an attack towards Chinese people, culture nor cuisine. If you told me you\u2019ll take me to an \u201cAmerican restaurant\u201d, I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s just as trashy. OP never stated they were Americans, or even western. They could be Thai or Japanese. European or African. American or Latino. The only racism here is your assumptions and the fact that you can\u2019t look past your own nose to see that semantic categories, while maybe inherently prejudiced or racist themselves, are not necessarily expressions of personal prejudice or racism. Linguistic pragmatism is understanding things in context, therefore assumptions based on a broader category which harbours certain connotations, implications and meanings are not necessarily borne out of hatred, ignorance or prejudice towards the group which that category marginalises. It\u2019s a broader issue than that, and blatantly denying that and resting the responsibility on the interpreter rather than the one speaker, or the societal ignorance that has created the prominence of ignorant and prejudiced terms, is a safe way to make sure we can never get better as a society. Purposely acting ignorant towards the stereotypes invoked in certain phrases and semantic categories to judge others that interpret said phrases or categories, is just as damaging.", "No, trousers can be very elegant and fetching.

She doesn't have to wear a dress, but worn out jeans doesn't sound appropriate for this nice restaurant.", "YTA. One, you should have set the expectation when you first told her about the date, that fancy food = fancy clothing. This isn't always the case and needs to be clarified. Two, when you saw her dressed down, you immediately jumped to \"but you should wear fancier clothing/a dress\" instead of \"you normally like to dress up, is something up/are you okay?\" \n\nThe \"I don't feel like it tonight\" really sounds to me like she may have been not feeling well or on her period and wasn't feeling up to dressing up or being fancy. Sometimes it just is like that, especially if someone has painful periods!", "NTA. I think maybe it could\u2019ve been communicated better. She could just be feeling upset about something else so she didn\u2019t feel up to getting fancy, but she should\u2019ve communicated that. Also I understand OP\u2019s point.. if you\u2019re requesting to go to a fancy restaurant I\u2019d want my spouse and I to dress up for the occasion.

Especially if you don't know why. She could be self conscious or just generally not feeling comfortable in her body right now and by asking her to put on something fancy she might come to the conclusion that you want to police what she is wearing in general, which I'm almost certain wasn't your intention. This is especially important though when she usually has no problem or even likes dressing fancy. This may mean that something is bothering her right now and pressuring her on wearing fancy clothes might increase that issue.\n\nThe reason why it's a very soft YTA is because if it actually is a fancy restaurant she maybe wouldn't even get in with her chosen clothes. And some establishments just require a certain attire. She also apparently did snap on you which is something you need to talk about with her. Get to the bottom of the issue, but without putting any blame on her as that will just result in her shutting down even further. \n\nI personally think that the right course of action would've been to react differently to her choice of clothes, maybe ask if something is the matter, then inform her of the issue at hand without faulting her and then maybe suggesting going to a different place instead where she might feel more comfortable. \n\nHonestly though this also kinda depends on your tone of voice and on the actual clothes she choose. I cannot tell for certain if she actually wore something that wouldn't be acceptable at a fancy place as if it was just trousers, she'd be totally fine, but if they were torn and visibly old, she wouldn't be.", "NTA But if your gf normally gets dressy and wasn't dressed appropriately for the environment, maybe check on her general well-being.", "YTA the restaurant you showed us had people in very casual clothes too.
