If you just mean not distressed jeans, okay.", "NTA - if she didn't feel like dressing up either of you could have suggested going somewhere else. She isn't tha asshole for not wanting to dress up, she is the A for not communicating what her problem was.", "NTA. From her response, my insight would be that she did not dress up specifically because she felt that a chinese restaurant could not be upscale, which is based on her ignorance and prejudice.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t want to go to a Chinese restaurant but couldn\u2019t use her big girl words, hopefully she isn\u2019t a racist.", "NTA. When you agree to go out to a fancy restaurant, you also agree to dress up.", "Seems like she didn't want to go but not mature enough to just say that so she created a situation which would provoke an argument so she could make you out to be the bad guy", "NTA. Second hand embarrassment is a thing", "YTA. Just let her dress as she wish, if you're embarrassed by her it's probably to go with take away.", "YTA mildly.", "YTA. You seem to have conflated smart clothing with 'a dress'. Why did it need to be a dress? There are plenty of smart clothes women can wear that are not dresses. \n\nShe isn't an AH for looking at pictures of the restaurant and determining that, in her view, she was dressed appropriately. You aren't an AH for having a different view, but the whole 'why aren't you wearing a dress' thing...yep I can see why that irritated her.", "YTA, just a bit. You should not have insisted and gone anyway. Best case scenario nobody but you care, worst case she would feel out of place and uncomfortable and you could say \u201cI told you\u201d.\nIn the best case scenario you could then have a conversation that dressing up was your expectation for a fancy night and her choice to agree but not follow hurt your feeling.", "YTA.", "This feels a bit off. Are you sure she was okay with the restaurant choice. Could it be that when you suggested upscale, she was expecting something even fancier, and is passive aggresive about it?", "NAH, but given that you say she usually does dress up, I might have taken it a bit more seriously when she said she didn\u2019t want to. Maybe she really didn\u2019t feel able to put in a lot of effort. Perhaps you could have said \u201cok well why don\u2019t we go to <some casual place> and save this for a night you\u2019re up to something fancy\u201d She might have still had the same reaction, but I suspect not.", "NTA", "Yta", "When you hear fancy, Chinese doesn\u2019t come to mind. She didn\u2019t feel like investing effort into her looks for a plate of Chinese food and she was expecting something French or similar. I honestly don\u2019t blame her, I would be disappointed as well. \n\nNAH, just miscommunication and different expectations.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to wear appropriate clothing to a restaurant. Her contempt, and possible racism, may suggest deeper problems.", "NTA.  I went through something similar with my husband.  My kids were very little and my MIL was visiting from another state.  She told us to go have a date night (we didn't know many people in our area and closest family was 2 hours away, so date nights were very rare.)  I chose a really nice Italian place and wore a cute dress, straightened my hair, put on makeup...  Husband came down from upstairs wearing Teva type sandals with no socks (well, thank God for no socks,) which were totally inappropriate for a nice restaurant in Wisconsin in November.  I started crying.  Could he not be bothered to look nice for me on our date?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, perhaps she wasn't feeling great about how she looks?", "YTA", "Fancy people are weird, just go eat with your girlfriend?

Like a pair of jeans (not ripped) and a blouse probably would have been passable, but ripped jeans at a nicer restaurant is a bit much. \n\nImagine driving all the way to diner and then they won\u2019t even let you in because of an outfit you warned your partner about. I would be pretty pissed.", "Yeah I agree, her response is ignorant at best.", "The correct action would have been to cancel the nice restaurant and take her to one more fitting.

It'd be very unexpected for a modern Chinese restaurant to care. Billionaires show up in hoodies and jeans. It used to be a flex to dress down and now it's just normal.", "I didn\u2019t get that at all", "She was in a t-shirt and worn-down jeans - does that sound like smart clothing to you?", "I disagree, depending on the restaurants, they don't even let you in If you don't dress that goes with the atmosphere of the restaurants. Is that embarrassment worth it? Theres so many details we need to know. How long are they dating, is girlfriend very tired, is she racist because she said \"it's just Chinese\", does she not want to eat Chinese that day and couldn't convey it? Untill all the detail come out we can't say OP is TA.", "You might want to examine your prejudices because there are plenty of nice Chinese restaurants and this comment comes off extremely ignorant. French cuisine isn\u2019t inherently nicer than Chinese cuisine and I\u2019d unpack why you think that way if I were you.", "Considering op did show pictures and they have chosen the place together, the fact \u201cChinese is not fancy generally\u201d is not an excuse imho", "Out of interest what cultures do you associate with fancy food? \nMost if not all cultures have their street/fast food/takeaway style of food, they all have other food as well. I\u2019ve been to fancy Chinese restaurants that had a dress code.", "You\u2019re thinking of North American-style Chinese food. It may be easily accessible, but it\u2019s not the real thing. \n\nLike every other cuisine in the world, real Chinese food can run the gamut from fast street food to intricate dishes with high-end ingredients and techniques, and you\u2019re expected to give the restaurant the respect it deserves by dressing appropriately. \n\nIf you imagine that people from China are eating chicken balls and beef-and-broccoli dishes every day, or that they don\u2019t have the capability of making something better, it\u2019s time to confront your own ignorance.", "This dude was fine. \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CgtayxMv-Tw/", "It sounded more to me like it was about OP feeling embarrassed to show up with someone dressed casually. I think if it was as serious about not getting in OP would have mentioned that.\nBut yes of course on the extreme end of it the friends attire could even prevent them from getting in but I feel like if that was the case surely OP would have mentioned that to the friend.", "Their Instagram is tagged by people who showed up in jeans and t-shirts.", "The \u201cit\u2019s just Chinese\u201d comment after being told it\u2019s a nicer restaurant, as if it\u2019s impossible for Chinese restaurants to be nice, is prejudiced and ignorant at best and racist at worst. \n\nIt was my first reaction to this post as well.", "I'd need to see the outfit and the restaurant pics to comment on that.", "Could be. You think women only look \u201csmart\u201d in dresses, or what?", "Oh yes that too - doesn't change my argument.\n\nIt's my opinion, that sometimes is better not to argue and let people face their wrongdoing.\n\nEDIT to extend: I am not saying OP is in the wrong, but he could have managed the situation better", "Do you think that they call them \u201cChinese restaurants\u201d in for example China? No? Well that\u2019s the issue then. If you tell me \u201cAmerican restaurant\u201d (I\u2019m not American) then I\u2019ll also assume some prejudice towards that place. It\u2019s just a trash way to describe a restaurant. I don\u2019t call a sushi restaurant a \u201cJapanese restaurant\u201d, for example. OP used the term \u201cChinese restaurant\u201d, his partner can only interpret whatever he means by that.", "How is OP supposed to know that if they\u2019ve never been before? \n\nMost places do say it somewhere on their website, but we have no way of knowing if OP read their actual website in its entirety since all they mentioned was the Instagram feed.", "How was I supposed to know that?", "I dunno. \u201cIt\u2019s just burgers\u201d isn\u2019t racist.\n\nEdit because I can\u2019t reply because they blocked me: Chinese is a colloquial term for a cuisine and style of restaurant.", "\u201cChinese restaurant\u201d is a category in and of itself. Whether that\u2019s racist or not isn\u2019t something that\u2019s the fault of one woman. It\u2019s the words OP used to categorise the restaurant to which he is taking her, or intends to. The vast majority of \u201cChinese restaurants\u201d in my country are buffets that source their ingredients from the same suppliers, and are of shabby quality, for example. That\u2019s not an attack towards Chinese people, culture nor cuisine. If you told me you\u2019ll take me to an \u201cAmerican restaurant\u201d, I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s just as trashy. OP never stated they were Americans, or even western. They could be Thai or Japanese. European or African. American or Latino. The only racism here is your assumptions and the fact that you can\u2019t look past your own nose to see that semantic categories, while maybe inherently prejudiced or racist themselves, are not necessarily expressions of personal prejudice or racism. Linguistic pragmatism is understanding things in context, therefore assumptions based on a broader category which harbours certain connotations, implications and meanings are not necessarily borne out of hatred, ignorance or prejudice towards the group which that category marginalises. It\u2019s a broader issue than that, and blatantly denying that and resting the responsibility on the interpreter rather than the one speaker, or the societal ignorance that has created the prominence of ignorant and prejudiced terms, is a safe way to make sure we can never get better as a society. Purposely acting ignorant towards the stereotypes invoked in certain phrases and semantic categories to judge others that interpret said phrases or categories, is just as damaging.", "No, trousers can be very elegant and fetching. The fact is that this girl was going to an upmarket restaurant in a t-shirt and worn-down jeans. \nThere is a time and a place for a t-shirt and worn-down jeans, but it is not at an upmarket restaurant.  It would be embarrassing.", "That argument makes no sense. People say \u201cItalian restaurant\u201d, \u201cGreek restaurant\u201d or \u201cFrench restaurant\u201d all the time and can imagine wide varieties of quality, price and formality. \u201cChinese restaurant\u201d is not synonymous with junk, and if it is to you, you need to look to either yourself or the culture you grew up in and analyze why.", "OP showed his partner the restaurant before they went, no interpretation is necessary.", "There's no way you go to a restaurant so fancy that it requires a dresscode and you just completely miss that information. Either you already know about the place and then you'd know about the dresscode or you found the place somewhere and then surely you'd have read that information somewhere.\nI would find it very hard to believe that you'd go to a place so fancy that it requires you to dress fancy and that information just completely eludes you when booking.", "They said the dress code is smart casual when I made reservations", "Yeah. Totally. Just thought I'd share the info.", "Yes, because burgers is not an ethnicity or an entire cultural category of cuisine. This comparison makes no sense. Are you under the impression that all Chinese food is casual and cheap?", "Burgers are fast food. China is a huge landmass with several cultures and a huge range of cuisines beyond the dishes invented by Chinese immigrants for western palates.", "Because that\u2019s comparing apples and oranges? Like if you don\u2019t see the difference in those two statements you should probably take a long hard look at your own prejudices.", "OP said he showed the restaurant to her online, so she would have known it isn't one of those Chinese restaurants you're talking about.", "In America perhaps, I can\u2019t say. Ethnically/nationally themed restaurants in my country are invariably shit. Tapas restaurants vs. Spanish restaurant. Sushi vs. Japanese. Pizzaria vs. Italian restaurant. I could go on. Sounds like what\u2019s really problematic is your refusal to see the issue with the terms OP uses to begin with. If you use terms that invoke and imply shitty things, people will interpret shitty things. Maybe stop assuming and admit to the larger issue that we can\u2019t just categorise shit as \u201c*Ethnicity/nationality* restaurant\u201d.", "Having worked many years in the service industry I can promise you people can. You would be absolutely astounded at what people miss. \n\nThe service industry really shows you the depths of stupidity humanity is capable of.", "So not dressy at all and by the sounds of it not upscale? Tshirt and jeans might have been too casual - but you made it sound like cocktail dress would be required. \n\nSmart casual is not dressy.", "Pretty arrogant to state your opinion as a fact and personal attack.", "\ud83d\ude44\n\nEdit: I\u2019m very introspective. You\u2019re just wrong.", "https://instagram.com/hutongdubai?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nThis is their Instagram.

Someone who refuses to do any introspection and confront uncomfortable ideas is someone who will always be ignorant. Bye.", "I don't know about Dubai but I'm used to NYC where dress codes are exceptionally rare. Usually more for clubs. Does it stand out? I don't notice. \n\nShe might've been having a low day and wanted you to focus more on her feelings than any social judgment. It might've meant a lot if you checked on her or shifted to a nice, casual spot. Assuming this was truly out of character for her."]}
