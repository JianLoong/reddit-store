Are you inviting him, by the way?\n\nTell your mom and any of her siblings who's giving you a hard time that they can stay home in solidarity with her if they keep pushing about it.  You deserve a wonderful wedding without having to deal with that awful woman.", "Past trauma does not excuse future abuse. Your mom did you a disservice by subjecting you to her mom's evil attitude.", "Of course. Take care and stay strong!", "No, she is not a good mother. A good mother wouldn't allow someone in her house that treats her child this way. A good mother wouldn't allow someone to stay in her house after she told her child she was the reason her husband died of cancer. A good mother wouldn't allow someone to stay in the house after calling her daughter a dirty slut for having a black bra, or being racists to your friend, or saying you're the ugliest of the sisters, or you're too fat for your wedding dress. A GOOD MOTHER would not sit by and watch someone abuse their child for years and then make excuses for them!

The fact that those family members want to continue the cycle of trauma means that they are the AHs, not you.
