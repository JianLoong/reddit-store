She had a hard life growing up and is cold to most people but she has always been vindictive to me, I\u2019m not entirely sure why but she just takes a dislike to certain people one of her sons is completely estranged from her because she of how she treated him growing up. \n\nMy mother is the oldest and is very sympathetic to her due to witnessing a lot of the abuse that my grandad (her husband) put her through and due to that she moved in with us when I was 15 and she made my life hell. She told me I was the reason my dad died of cancer, she called me a dirty slut because she walked into my room when I was changing and I was wearing a black bra. She said I was the least pretty of my sisters because I looked like my dads side of the family and as teen I just hated my appearance. She was also extremely racist to my best friend when she came round and it was just awful. I felt on edge in my home for years and my mom would get mad at her but she would just cry about her past and my mom would forgive her.\n\nFast forward to now me and my partner are engaged and very happy, we have our own home, good jobs and I feel the stability and love has helped heal a lot of the trauma I suffered. She still lives with my mom I am polite when I visit but that\u2019s the extent of our relationship. \n\nI had my dress appointment and chose a beautiful dress and actually felt beautiful in it. When I went to visit my mom I was showing her pictures and my mom was complimentary and gushed about the dress my Nan asked to see and I stupidly let her look. She smirked and said a girl with my body type could never pull this dress off and said I best start dieting. \n\nI lost my shit. I essentially told her she would not have to worry about my dress because she\u2019s not welcome at my wedding. My mom tried to calm me down but they I just started on her and said she had failed me by allowing her to treat me like shit my whole life, I stormed out and went home. \n\nThe reaction from my family is mixed my sisters and partner has been very supportive and whilst they think I should not have shouted they agree with me that it\u2019s my wedding and I can choose who I invite. My mom and her six other siblings think I was completely out of order. They have said I\u2019m wedding is likely to be the last my Nan attends so I have no right to take that away from her. I feel like I could of handled the situation much more maturely however if someone else would have made the comment I definitely would have been but I just felt triggered and it reminded me of everything else she had said to me over the years.

Weddings are about the couple who is getting married and no one else. You are allowed to invite whoever you want!\n\n2.

You are right in that she failed you.\n\nA hard life doesn't excuse shitty behavior. Being your grandmother doesn't mean that you have to tolerate her mistreatment of you. If your mom and her siblings want to do that, that's their prerogative.  Don't be surprised if some of them don't show up to the wedding, but honestly,  I don't think it's a big loss.

No. NO. Your past troubles and current struggles do not give you a free pass to be an unwarranted knobhead. You're just handing out more trauma and hurt by doing that.\n\nHaving my own trauma, I always try to treat others more kindly than I was treated; showing care and respect usually begets care and respect. You can decide in time who you want to have in your life based on how they treat you in turn. At least make an effort, else just give up and get in the fucking bin, because that's where people will eventually put you if you treat them like shit.\n\nEdit: grammar", "I also have to add, don't forget to eat at your wedding.
