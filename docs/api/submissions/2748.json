Before me, my GF had dated her childhood friend for several years, who passed away when she was 19. I did not know him, but judging from the baby photos et cetera, they knew each other since infancy. Their parents were friends too, and Julia had mentioned when they were younger they were basically expected to marry. Important to add is that they both grew up in the ex\u2019s home country, not my country or Julia\u2019s. \n\nMy GF was understandably devastated when he passed, and even has a tattoo relating to him. In her defense she has never made me feel second place or even brought him up much around me. But I\u2019m not an idiot so I know his death must have been really horrible for her, especially as both of them were really young. \n\nNow, Julia has a month long business trip in another country: the country her ex was from. She asked me if it was ok if she stayed with the ex\u2019s family, as they know her so well they would be really happy to host her for the month rent-free and they actually offered before she even asked. \n\nHowever, I said no. Before I sound like an asshole, let me say my piece. I don\u2019t want her to go there and get lost in memories of some ex, which would be inevitable if she stayed in his old house for a month. I also don\u2019t want to risk our relationship over her suddenly discovering some long standing grief that didn\u2019t exist across our relationship. So, I said no, and said she should get a hotel.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t call me an asshole, but she has been cool with me since I said it. I\u2019m still not sure what\u2019s wrong about that - she wouldn\u2019t go stay with a family of a living ex, so I don\u2019t know why the situation is different here.

The man is dead - he's no threat to your relationship. And if a dead man could damage your relationship, it wouldn't be worth saving. His family are her beloved lifelong family friends, and she should stay with them if that's what she wants.", "YTA. If you compete against the dead, you'll lose everytime.", "YTA. When I read the title, I thought he was still alive and even then I was prepared to vote YTA for using the language \u201clet my GF\u2026\u201d Your girlfriend is not your child, your pet, or your possession. You don\u2019t get to tell her what she can and can\u2019t do.\n\nIn this particular circumstance, it sounds like she\u2019s only ever had one previous boyfriend and he\u2019s dead. How on earth are you threatened by that?\n\nOP, you sound controlling. I hope the trip away opens your GF eyes and she finds a decent man in BF #3.", "YTA- regardless of your relationship her ex wasn't just a boyfriend, he was a childhood friend she grew up and will always be a part of her life. \nShe's clearly close to his family and the fact that you have so much insecurity (for no reason as you acknowledge she's never made you feel to doubt your relationship) that you won't 'let her' stay with them is sad.", "YTA, why is that a big deal?  Her boyfriend is DEAD. Let her have some time with his Family there is nothing wrong about that. Are you jealous of him? Even tho he is dead? Get a grip", "YTA.  First, your phrasing describes this as something you LET her do.  She doesn't actually need your permission, does she?  Second, your response is selfish. You're preventing her from seeing people she cares about because you're afraid there's some possibility that it will make her like you less. Well you can be sure that isolating her is going to make her like you less in the long run.  Also, so what if she needs to grieve? Why would you deny someone you care about the chance to fully grieve?\n\nI hope you can see why you're wrong here. Because this isn't going to go well for you if you continue to try to control her.", "YTA. He\u2019s dead. Even if she felt nostalgic, there\u2019s no threat to your relationship. She\u2019s known that family since she was a tiny kid, and they mean more to her than just her ex\u2019a family. You say you don\u2019t see the difference between that and staying with the family of A living ex, but I don\u2019t understand how you couldn\u2019t see the difference. If it were a living ex, the problem would be the suspicion or possibly that cheating might happen. That\u2019s literally impossible, so that issue doesn\u2019t exist.", "YTA and honestly, this decision is more likely to cost you your relationship. She isn't going to find some new grief she didnt know she had. Losing a loved one will always hurt. She grew up woth his family as an almost second family and you're really hurting her by telling her you don't want her to continue a relationship with them because you're insecure.", "YTA and insecure are you scared she\u2019s going to have a seance and replace you with Casper the ghost . Trust me if your relationship isn\u2019t strong enough to withstand some memories that she probably already thinks about then there\u2019s probably a lot more of life it won\u2019t withstand .", "YTA- especially for saying she may discover she has some unresolved grief. A supportive partner would want her to work through her grief process. Also, it sounds like she will be in a different country- you want her to stay by herself/alone vs. staying with a warm and inviting family to help her adjust over the month.", "YTA. Your issue with her staying there is your insecurities in yourself and in your relationship. You\u2019re worried about they way she could potentially feel, and how that could potentially affect her affection towards you. Saying no to her is expressing your distrust in her feelings for you and your distrust in the strength of your relationship. The fact that she asked how you feel about is a credit to her consideration of you. In a mature healthy relationship, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "YTA \nIf she has unresolved grief she needs to deal with it, it will always haunt her, whether she stays there for a month or not.\nYou do not control her, she can stay where she wants.", "JFC YTA\n\nStop competing with a dead man.", "YTA.  She treated you respectfully by asking for your blessing.  You should know that your reply was unexpected and uncaring.  Why can't you tell the difference between a living boyfriend and a dead one?  IMO, you are incredibly insensitive and childish.  She should find a man that knows his place beside her, not in front of her.", "YTA so very much. \n\nIt would be one thing if the ex was still alive and living there, then yeah, I'd be pissed if she was staying him for a month. But he's dead. What's she going to do, cheat on you with her mom and dad? You know this dude was important to her for a long, long time. Let her get some closure, cry a bit with the dude's parents and get it out of her system.   \n\n\nAnd not for nothing, but if she actually does do what you're afraid of - come home and not want to be with you anymore because of the memories of the ex - then your relationship wasn't going to last anyway. If she loves you, she is not going to leave you for memories a dead person. You're being paranoid for no reason and it's not making you look good in her eyes. If she leaves you for anything, it would be for that.", "YTA \n\n> I also don\u2019t want to risk our relationship over her discovering some long standing grief\n\nSo you decided to risk your relationship by being controlling and jealous of a dead man? \n\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019ll go well for you.\n\nShe\u2019s known his family for most of her life according to your comments. Don\u2019t get in the way because you\u2019re insecure.", "YTA\n\nYou need to get a grip on your own insecurities before that's the reason you're single.", "Wow, this is shocking. You are being irrational and very cold and unemphatic. Also, if for some reason your fears did turn into reality (although you give no evidence why they would), that would be her decision and you have no right to try to control her like that.", "YTA, immensely. She probably wouldn't have fallen out of love with you just by being there, but you forbidding it just might cause it.", "YTA \n\nAlso, if they didn\u2019t break up before he died, it\u2019s not accurate to call him her \u201cex\u201d. But it says a lot about your insecurity here.", "Also the situation is very different. He died FFS!", "YTA!  You can't control her memories, and you shouldn't try to \"forbid\" her from going to see long-term family friends because of your own insecurities.", "YTA. He\u2019s literally no threat. Imagine the joy she must bring to those grieving parents.", "YTA. She is not going to cheat on you with a ghost ffs.", "YTA. He's dead and gone. She SHOULD go there and she SHOULD get lost in his memories. From what you describe her relationship to him was important and she knows his parents. It sounds like a no brainer that she stays with them and visits. I am sure they miss their son and having her there would help continue his memory. You aren't just an AH, you are a selfish AH to deny all of these people the time to cherish together.", "YTA. You\u2019re cutting your partner off from childhood loved ones, and acting jealous of a dead man. \n\nGet over it. This isn\u2019t something for you to \u201clet her\u201d do, or not. This should be her decision, and you\u2019re getting in the way.", "YTA. The man is dead, bro. You're jealous of a dead man. He literally cannot do anything to you because he's been dead for years. If she rediscovers grief, it's not new. It was always there, she just never got a chance to share it with his family before. \n\n\nI mean, you would have been the asshole just for thinking you have any right to tell her where she can stay when she's on a business trip overseas, or ever, but the reasoning only makes it worse. You are so insecure you are trying to prohibit your girlfriend from grieving someone who is important to her. You're also assuming she doesn't just want to go and have a good time with family friends.", "YTA. You won\u2019t \u201clet\u201d her stay with her DEAD ex\u2019s family? Sounds like she has had a long relationship with them. I hope she throws the whole insecure man away.", "Well, I would have to say yes in this sense.  He is dead.  She has to process her grief and it's not up to you to decide how she does so.  It could be incredibly healing for her and his family to see one another.   \n\nI think the impact of you saying no in this situation would have more negative consequences for your relationship than visiting the home of her deceased ex.  It seems like you said no for pretty selfish reasons in all honesty.\n\n  Have you stopped to think that this person who passed on was significant in her life and maybe she needs that closure in order to give you a more healed, full version of herself? It could possibly be very beneficial to your relationship in fact. \n\nI think you should apologize to her and let her know why you said no, and work through this with an open mind and heart.  I would support her going.  \n\n I wouldn't say you're being a complete asshole, but it was pretty insensitive and selfish.   Your concerns are with a dead man influencing your living relationship. \u2764\ufe0f", "Omg \u2620\ufe0f The man died, FFS. If you feel that your relationship is threatened by a dead guy, you\u2019re probably more than a little insecure. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA, he's dead. They are probably like family to her. Plus, she's not your property, she can do what she wants.", "YTA.  What does it matter if she uncovers some new grief?  She might.  She might not.  If you love her you'll support her through that struggle.  If you think your relationship is so unstable that it couldn't handle that then you have a problem that exists whether she stays at her ex's home or not.", "YTA. \n\nYou're jealous if a man who died almost 10 years ago. Having a relationship with his family, especially since it sounds like she new this guy from infancy, obviously means a lot to her. \n\nYou don't get to \"let\" your girlfriend do anything. She is an adult who can make her own choices.", "YTA.", "YTA. How insecure are you to be threatened by memories? He's dead. A month in the house will be nostalgic or sad or joyous for her.", "YTA \n\nNot just for saying no, but deciding how she will/would feel for her. She might be sad. She might grieve. She might find closure. You are denying her of that because of your own insecurities and not wanting to deal with her potentially grieving him. They aren't just her exs parents, they are family friends. \n\nHe is not just some ex, he was her friend, boyfriend and family. He and his family was and always will be part of her life in someway.

There is a difference. \n\nAnd you have now damaged your relationship over your jealousy of a dead man.\n\nAnd if you cannot see/understand the difference between a  relationship ending because a couple broke up and relationship ending because one of the people in it died, then you are far too immature to be in a relationship with anybody.\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you two were to break up, it'd be over your jealousy not her grief.  It's not like she would be able to have an affair with him.  And she would be seeing them anyway, regardless if she was staying there anyway.

Get over yourself.", "INFO: did their relationship end because they broke up or because he died? \nIf it is because he passed away, YTA. That\u2019s not an ex.

Loving and supportive partner would want her to be able to work through any long standing grief she may still have (if she discovers it, then it did exist during your relationship she just didn\u2019t recognize it). \n\nWeird that she \u201casked if it was okay\u201d instead of how you would feel if she stayed there. Also \u201cnot letting her\u201d implies that she has no choice and has to do what you say, despite how she feels or what she wants. \n\nSounds like the biggest threat to your relationship is your insecurity and controlling behaviour.", "Omg he's dead.
