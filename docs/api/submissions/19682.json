I understand how Bea feels because no one likes to be left out of something, especially through no fault of her own. But it\u2019s entirely unrealistic to expect that there would not be any conversation centered around a tv show that many in the group love and watch. At that age, I would have been sneaking watches on my friends devices if streaming had been around then.", "She must be feeling left out and misplacing her anger about it towards you instead of her parents. That being said NTA, that sounds like a her problem. You can offer to have a mature conversation with her about it but if she's not willing/capable to do that, again: that sounds like a her problem.", "I was banned from watching the Power Rangers when I was a kid. That didn\u2019t stop me from going to a friend\u2019s house to watch it. \n\nNTA, and I\u2019m not responsible for anything this inspires you to do!", "NTA- this is classic displacement. She can\u2019t get mad at her parents so she\u2019s taking her frustration out on you.", "N A H if Bea was simply expressing her frustration about feeling left out.  \n\n\n>*being told I wasn\u2019t allowed to.*\n\nN T A if she actually said you weren't allowed to talk about or sing something related to this TV show or others.", "NTA. I was like your friend. I never got to eat fast food. I never owned anything that was on an advert. No TV. Nothing happened in my life apart from school work or prayer. Never once took it out on anyone kind enough to include me in their friend groups. In fact many loved that I was a fresh slate who wasn't influenced by the many distractions in life and thought my opinions were very unique. They also loved explaining to me whenever I didn't understand. So not only did I have to act right, my classmates had to be nice too in order to create a nice environment for all of us. So if your friend is acting up, cut them out.. they'll eventually learn that no one needs to put up with their shit. If you are being mean and teasingly singing songs around them that you know will annoy them then they need to find a new friend group", "NTA but out of curiosity what's the show?", "What did you watch? I am always looking for high quality shows that will oscillate, vibrate, reverberate and resonate?", "NAH - I was that kid who was very restricted with TV. I was so jealous of the kids who were allowed to watch nighttime shows! You're NTA for talking about TV and she's NTA for feeling left out.", "I'd say ESH \n\nYes, you and your friends are free to speak whatever you like, but if Bea is really your friend you'd find ways to incorporate her into the conversation, or just talk about something that she can relate to or just understand. \nTry to put yourself in her shoes for a bit. Think if she's being dramatic or just frustrated because her friends are talking about things that they know that she can't see.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I answered the prompt asking why I could be TA for this scenario that she could have felt left out, which I understand.
