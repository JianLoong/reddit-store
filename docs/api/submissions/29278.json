Then again, she wasn't nearly as selfish and self-centered as your sister sounds to be.\n\nPersonally, I don't understand the urge for expensive weddings, but if you cannot afford it, then you absolutely shouldn't make others feel obligated to make up the difference.", "NTA, but your parents were not wise in taking out a loan for a wedding dress.  That is ridiculous and just enabling this behavior.", "Nta is she the literal worst?", "NTA - someone needed to tell her.", "NTA This is what you respond.\n\n\"Regardless of if it is your special day, your vision should NEVER put all of us in debt. Tone down your vision to a realistic budget and stick to the budget. Stop looking at things outside of the budget and then you won't fall in love with things you can't afford. Our brothers, sisters and I are not your piggy bank and you are financially abusing Mom and Dad. Grow up, put your big girl panties on, and figure out either how to afford this \"vision\" by yourself or tone it down to reality. We are supportive of your marriage to (name). We are wholly unsupportive of this princess entitlement attitude. No one should ever be treated the way you have been treating Mom and Dad.\"", "NTA and I think you know that. She\u2019s asking way too much from everyone.", "NTA \n\nSomeone needs to give her a reality check and good for you! I just feel bad for your parents. They shouldn't have put themselves into debt for a dress. She's going to wear it once.", "NTA.... but you'll definitely be an ass hole if you don't tell the poor groom to RUN !!", "You need to talk to your parents! Someone needs to stop them from contributing anything more.\n\nSis needs to be cut off. Sound the alarm before she gets any more money from anyone!\n\nAnd obviously NTA.\n\nMost people know this already, but there\u2019s a correlation between the amount of money spent on a weekend and the length of a marriage. The more she spends, and possibility it shortens her marital bliss. No one is quite sure why, but a theory is that it starts the marriage out with money trouble, which is one leading cause of relationship issues/divorce.\n\nLook at it like you are helping save her marriage and stop the spending!", "ESH. She can have the wedding she wants if she can pay for it. Your negative response is limited to not going, and not throwing more financial backing her way. I would wonder why others have been entertaining her plans to this point.", "NTA. Someone was going to tell her this sooner or later. Destination weddings are bad enough, but the wardrobe demands are really being outrageous. And I have never heard of a bride asking her whole family to chip in for her dress, especially on top of everything else she is demanding they are already paying for. \n\nI understand a wedding should be special - but it\u2019s not for other people to sacrifice for, especially on demand.", "Simply say no.

Talk about entitled,  selfish, sibling who only care herself.\n\nUnsupportive?  Hell yes!  If my sister made demand like that I will not hesitate to break ties with her.", "NTA.", "NTA. Taking out a loan to afford a ultra expensive dress is ridiculous and if anyone was to take out a loan to do it, it should be her. She can't just demand money off everyone so she can have a more expensive wedding. If she wants the best wedding ever, get a job, save up and pay for it, it's no one else's responsibility.\n\nYou should sit down with your parents and explain that her demands are only becoming more and more outrageous and every time they give in they are hurting the family and hurting her. If she can't understand and live within her means then she's going to get into trouble if she just takes loans for anything she wants and gets into massive debt early in her life for no reason.\n\nI'd tell her that she's being horrifically selfish and manipulated her parents into debt just to get a more expensive dress for a single day.", "NTA... she has put unreasonable strain on the family and this is a selfish act. This is the time to step out of the situation.

But you're right, it would probably have been kinder to approach her more patiently. I still don't think you're the asshole. It's a wedding, not a coronation.  She's not becoming a queen.", "NTA. The fact of the matter is that the wedding industry has sold this whole \"princess\" mentality. \n\nSit down with her and ask her if any of you were to ask what she is asking of Mom and Dad what she would think. Then, ask her if she'd be willing to pony up for a trip to Italy for your wedding as well as help fund your wedding dress. Because the very fact that she is asking all of you to shell out thousands of dollars for her \"vision\" is ridiculous.\n\nRemind her that all of this is supposed to be about two people committing their lives to eachother. Not creating a lifetime of debt for herself and everyone else. That is horrible footing to start a marriage on."]}
