She has stage 4 cancer, and is due for more chemotherapy soon after doing it a few months prior. This was something decided by expert doctors. Because of this all, her health is frail, and as of right now I am pretty much in charge of everything and taking care of her whenever she needs it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I feel overwhelmed at times. I'm pretty much her only caretaker. I have previously asked for help from my relatives, wishing to have some sort of additional caretaker here. It doesn't even have to be them themselves, I am also willing to pay a person to occasionally come by and assist with her. Every time I ask however, it seems that my relatives always downplay the situation, tell me that I am capable of helping her and that her side-effects are just from the medicines she has to take.\r  \n\r  \nRecently I had to make a call to one of my mother's friends, because she had fallen on the floor. She was okay, just had lost senses in her legs. I couldn't physically lift her up again, and the situation was not serious enough for me to call the ER, so I called one of her friends over to help her up again. I guess something clicked there.\r  \n\r  \nOver the next few days, I started getting considerably more visits from mom's friends and relatives. What mildly annoys me is the fact that her church friends also got a whiff of the situation and arrived to the doorstep, just for them to lecture me on how my mother has been cursed and then proceeded to spend the next hour in her bedroom disturbing her rest and reading out bible verses to her. I'm not a religious person, but this honestly left a bad taste in my mouth.\r  \n\r  \nEvery time someone comes over, the general tone is \"she's dying\", and it's not good for my psyche but most importantly it's also leaving an impact on her. She may not be as active as before and may need some assistance walking, but she is usually within her mind and understands what people are implying. As a result of this, I've had to support her a lot more, because she genuinely thinks she's doomed to die. It's gotten to the point where I'm considering refusing letting her guests in unless I know that they're here to help with the situation. Then again, I feel like I should also let them have the right to visit my mother.\r  \n\r  \nI know this is a pretty horrible thing with a high mortality rate, but her current treatment shows improvement, there's doctors checking up on her by call + visitations and I have not gotten the \"she has x months left to life\" talk. The fact that they're also willing to keep on with the chemotherapy, tells me that she still has a chance for life, because if she was dying, I feel like it wouldn't be an option.

No hey, seriously, what TH did I just read?\n\nRight now you and your mom need help, support and understanding. An ear that listens, not a mouth that talks nonsense.\n\n\r  \nYou especially don't need bs or people reminding you how bad stage four cancer is. You know it.\n\n\r  \nCaregiver burnout is real, and it seems to me that these people are hurting your mental health, so I would give them a speech like, \"Look, I know you love my mom, I know you're worried, but your attitude doesn't help me or mum at all, we don't need it.\"\n\n\r  \nIf they understand, well. If they don't understand, at least they can use you the courtesy of not aggravating you.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, you deserve the world for taking care of your mother.\n\nSecondly, both your psyche and your mothers' psyche are INCREDIBLY important. Willpower to continue to get treatment and make healthy choices are dependent on peoples' belief that they will get better. Everybody who isn't you, your mother, or her doctor can take their 'expert' opinions about her prognosis and shove it up their ass.\n\nI sincerely wish you two the best :)", "NTA\n\nAnd no they do not have any right to visit someone and bring them down mentally. When you visit a sick person you want to make them feel better and smile.   \nIf they don't plan to act like adults, they have no reason to keep visiting. She might be dying and they are only visiting for their gossip, not because they actually care.", "NTA. You've been left with the full burden of your mother's care, which is exhausting, and I'm glad others are finally stepping up to help.\n\nBeing in charge, you have every right to limit who visits and for how long, both for your mother's comfort and your own. The religious contingent sound like they were the opposite of supportive and helpful.\n\nDid your mother *want* the church people to visit, or did they just turn up? My point being you've the right to refuse them, or any other potential visitor, access, if your Mother doesn't want them there.\n\nLanguage is important, especially when it comes to serious illness that can be terminal, but isn't always. It isn't appropriate IMO to label someone else with cancer as \"dying\" unless they say it of themselves.\n\nYou're carrying a lot. I hope you are getting the support YOU need, some breaks from this, enough rest. Caregiver burnout is very real, to say nothing of you being young and deserving of enjoying life. Wishing you and your mother strength and better days.", "NTA- if their \"she's dying\" attitude gets to her, it can actually affect her health and make things worse. Tell them if they cannot be positive, they cannot be around right now. Your mother still has a chance to make a recovery, according to her doctors, but if she gets depressed she could give it up because her \"friends\" convince her she is doomed.", "NTA.  Can you tell everyone who comes not to say certain things?  Then if they do, ask them to leave. You can say \u201cI told you that those types of comments increase my stress. I really need some quiet time now so can you please go so I can rest?\u201d  \n\nDon\u2019t argue about what\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d or what your mom can handle. Just say you need them not to say these things for your sake.\n\nIf you have anyone who understands, can you ask them to help spread the word about this?. \n\nI would turn the worst offenders away.  Don\u2019t let them in the door.  Tell them you are not up for visitors.  Unless they are super close with your mom you don\u2019t have to ever let them in.  And really if they were so close they\u2019d have been there months ago.  \n\nIt is totally fine not to let guests in.  It\u2019s your house and you are under terrible strain.  It really is all about you (and your mother).  No one else has the slightest right to be there, and any decent person would understand they aren\u2019t owed a second of your time under these circumstances.", "First, CANCER SUCKS and I am really sorry you are going through this with your mom.  It is a LOT, and I say this speaking from experience, having lost my mom a year ago to lung cancer.\n\nGet mom's input and make sure she wants to see people.  My mom only wanted certain visitors, and that was okay. People did understand.  Anyone causing her or you stress is a NO.  And you can tell, is she agitated after certain people leave?  If so, strictly limit or cease the visits if you can - they are not a comfort to her.\n\nKeep asking for help, but be specific about what you need where possible. I think that makes it easier for friends to respond.  Can you read mom her favorite novel while I pick up her meds or bring dinner on Tuesday?  I think guiding them helps because many just don't know what to do or say in this situation.\n\nAnd she is dying and I don't say that to hurt you, I say it because it's true.  Chemo may extend her life but is unlikely to cure her at Stage 4.  You are helping her on her journey with love and care, and you should be very proud of that.  Don't forget to take care of yourself too.  Love and prayers to you both.  NTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Here, it's usually expected that family helps.\n\nI have however reached out to my local government with some requests I can't do myself, for example helping transporting her to the hospital for her chemotherapy since I don't own a car, my relatives seem to be busy and I don't feel right putting her on public transport with how much could potentially happen. They usually have a social worker willing to help me out with small requests like these, which is honestly a ton of help already.", "NTA and honestly you don't need to deal with it too. These people may mean no bad but they're clearly massive stupids otherwise they would not talk like this in front of you. Start making excuses and reduce their visits (your mom \"will be asleep\" much more from now on. Sorry stupids she's sleeping come back like NEVER)", "Speak with the American Cancer Society.  They are great about providing necessities like a bed, bedside commode, bathing seats.  They deliver & pickup and for me, they charged nothing.

As others have said, visitors really have no rights, especially if they are negative or make you or your mom feel bad.\n\nSecond, look into some organizations in your area. Many offer forms of respite care, where someone else can take over caring for your mom for brief periods while you take a break. If you're in the US, and your mom is old enough, a local Council on Aging.  If that's not a possibility, there may be other agencies in your area that can help.

If they are there to bring the room down, they should leave now. If they tell you one thing and do the other, kick them out! Remind them that the doctor is very optimistic about your mother's treatment, and if they can not get on board with that, they can stay away until she recovers because they are not helping in any way! She needs support and optimism, not gloom and doom. Good luck to you and your mom. Since everyone has her fearing for the worst, plan something for when her treatments end.

My parents went to visit her one last time and took me along. But it wasn't to say goodbye, it was deathbed proselytizing to try to convince her to convert to Christianity so she could be saved. She was dying, and she was a Jew who practiced Taoism. The absolute last thing she wanted was a lecture on Jesus. I'm amazed she didn't kick them out. Even at the age of 7 or so I knew how ugly what they were doing was, but I didn't have the words for it.", "Nta\nIt seems like you're in the unfortunate position of having to be gatekeeper here. And I would do just that to keep those who don't wish well far away. I would keep them away. They don't mean well. Of course allow supportive peeps over, checking with your mom that she is ok with that. \n\nMy aunt is really sick. Every day at 11am she has any potential visitor call and she will then tell them if she is ok with visitors that day. If she says no.. It's no dice. Maybe you could try something like that. If your mom doesn't want to speak you can ask her and relay the messages that's she's not up for visitors that day. My aunt was getting overwhelmed... She has her son monitor her emails and send an automated message that she's not replying for a few days minimum. It's takes the stress off my aunt.\n\nAs a caretaker you'll need rest also as it's a lot of work so make sure you take care of you.

I don't think she need be treated as if she was dying and I'm sure that's not what she wants. She needs love and support and positivity. \n\nChemo and immunotherapy has come a long way.
