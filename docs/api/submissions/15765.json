He\u2019s a paralegal, and I\u2019m a SAHW. Up until now, we\u2019ve split chores and housework more or less 50/50, but I definitely do the more difficult tasks, plus I do all the shopping for groceries etc. I\u2019ve been feeling really burnt out from just doing chores all day and expressed this to my hubby, and basically asked if I could take a mini vacation from housework, just for a few weeks. I feel like a maid and that he just sees me as someone to clean his house for him. He laughed but I told him I was serious, and he said that the way we do it is already more than fair. I asked how is it more than fair if he has PTO and weekends/holidays but I don\u2019t get any of that? He said he gets PTO because he gets paid, and I\u2019m a stay at home wife so the chores are my responsibility just like paying the mortgage is his responsibility. I told him to cut the sexist bullsh-t and if that\u2019s how he feels we should just get a maid or something and the argument kind of went down from there. Since then he\u2019s been making snide remarks every so often about how I should get a job if I don\u2019t want to only do the chores, or stuff like that. It\u2019s really getting on my nerves and all I wanted was a few days off.

You can\u2019t take weeks off, at least outside of a family vacation that upends the life of everyone involved. No adult can! Working adults just have to handle it. Being a SAHW (not a SAHP, a SAHW) is a lifestyle choice\u2014and if you\u2019re doing it voluntarily, it\u2019s a lifestyle choice that even benefits the SAHW. If OP is burnt out to the degree that she wants weeks off, it\u2019s a sign that she isn\u2019t suited it being a SAHW, not a sign that she should get weeks off as an adult contributing to the household. And that\u2019s fine! There\u2019s no shame to realizing that a lifestyle structure does not fit you. It\u2019s not a sign that you can walk away from your looming domestic responsibilities, which literally every adult is responsible for constantly\n\nEDIT: SAHW who are largely filling the socialite life role and/or have alternate domestic responsibilities (like being the primary caregiver to parents) obviously have larger commitments that result in burn out.\n\nBut someone who chooses to be a stay at house spouse without external forces cannot try to clawback 50-50 domestic responsibilities from their spouse or push for a staycation (Actual vacations still exist)\u2014You\u2019re stepping out of the structured employment sphere to enter the endless domestic sphere by choice and benefiting from the immense flexibility of that choice by burdening someone else\u2014a consequence of that choice is sacrificing one\u2019s ability to duck one\u2019s domestic burden.", "They don\u2019t. Period. She is delusional and out of touch.", "After 7 months \ud83d\ude02", "I personally found wedding planning to be overwhelming and difficult. I had a small wedding and it honestly wasn\u2019t that much for me to do, I just found it stressful for some reason so I could understand if she\u2019s stressed about it and finding it hard, especially if it\u2019s a huge wedding with a lot of moving parts. Personally though, I would have continued working at least part time.", "My wife\u2019s ears just started burning.", "I'm the same as soon as I get home from work I am preparing dinner and getting chorea done and my weekends are for the chores I couldn't get done after work during the week.", "If I had an award I would give it to you", "100%.", "That\u2019s nice of you to show her some kindness. But she\u2019s actually doing what your partner is in this case and absolutely not what you\u2019re up against.", "A high maintenance wedding.", "I'm a SAHM and still do most of the chores. My husband does about half of the ones after work(dishes, quick toy pickup and bathtime for kiddo) I do the daily ones. Laundry, bathrooms; pet care etc.\n\nIt's insane that she's acting like 50/50 isn't even good enough.", "Shhhh!  It was Obedrin and all the wives had to take it to keep their husbands from running off with their secretaries.", "X\u2019er here, but I grew up with a neat freak \u201cperfect housewife\u201d mother. I have a very similar philosophy. My house looks neat enough that if someone wants to visit, I don\u2019t run around like a crazy person, but you can also tell I have kids. (The adult children are the worst offenders) I also believe if you want to come see me, come see me, if you want to critique my house, I\u2019ll show you the cleaning supplies.", "Also, the wedding was 7 months ago, and her answer to why she doesn't have a job now was that she left it to plan the wedding. That timeline is important I think lol", "When do you help him? Oh wait\u2026..", "Yes, we are saying you should do more work. You split the chores 50/50 currently. Your chores are not harder they are equal. You have no kids and he works full time. You are an entitled brat.", "Have you spelled out what exactly these \u201cmore difficult\u201d chores are? The group needs to know! Are you doing some light remodeling? Mucking out the horses? Scrubbing the bathroom grout with a teeny toothbrush?", "Yes, you potato!!!  Are you for real right now??!", "But OP doesn't have kids, her only job is to take care of the house. If I had a SAH spouse with kids I would expect an equal division of chores (situations can obviously change that balance). But I don't have the money to support a SAH (& I don't have kids) so it's all based on supposition anyway.", "I need more info in this, too...", "Her husband spills a full pot of dried beans in the fireplace every morning on his way to work, and she has to sift through the ashes to collect them all before she can go to the mall.", "Why not?", "It\u2019s like Robin Sparkles meets Cinderella", "Honestly, I think you\u2019re giving her too much credit. She is 27 and seems to have no comprehension of what \u201cpaid time off\u201d really is in the US, not to mention sick days, but more so the lack of both those in the US. \n\nThis whole thing reeks of privilege. If she was complaining that she was lonely, didn\u2019t get to see her husband, etc. I would agree with you, that she didn\u2019t think about the \u201cday to day life\u201d after her wedding. But this is much worse as she genuinely has a completely distorted view of what working life looks like.", "I don't know either.  Seems OP is unwilling to do much of anything", "If you honestly don't see it then i can't help you", "Well, she also claimed that her parents had to elope because her racist grandparents didn't want their son marrying someone with Native American blood. Research by a Cherokee geneaologist showed that her parents marriage was a typical marriage for that a( performed by clergy and big announcement in the paper ), and that Warren's claims of Native ancestry were vastly overrated. So I'd take any claims that Warren makes with a grain of salt.", "I mean, I'm good with math but I'm still definitely not an accountant. Scored higher than my lil bro in calculus and he is though lol.\n\nBut considering my resume no bank or other financial institutions would hire me for anything more than cleaning. Maybe once both the kids are in school I'll get a chance to actually find a career too."]}
