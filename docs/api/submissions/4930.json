If you don\u2019t want to go out, communicate that. Its not clear here how you are cancelling, but if you\u2019re too afraid to not commit, is it a stretch to say you\u2019re not being honest when you cancel? Its possible to say no in a way that shows you care, but you\u2019re spent socially and need some time.\n\nYour spouse sucks because it\u2019s not really up to them how often or with who you\u2019re social. I can see how you got to this point with that pressure.", "It's sad that you are alone and don't feel able to share this with your significant other.

Instead of being an adult who talks to her husband about an issue, you instead did sabotage behind his back for weeks and then threw a temper tantrum when he finally found out. \n\nIf you are too afraid or embarrassed to tell your husband, \"hey, I need some more alone time,\" then this relationship is doomed. Either you're a horrible communicator or you're scared of him having an angry reaction. Either way, it's toxic.", "ESH.

Your husband needs to back off, he's not your father and you're not ten.", "ESH - COMMUNICATE! There's plenty of room between \"never going out with them\" and \"going out with them every single day\". Live in that space, and let them know that you like them but also appreciate some downtime.", "NTA, for being overwhelmed by the friends. However you should speak up to your husband and tell him that you were just overwhelmed and you needed some time alone.\n\nI also think YTA because you didn't tell your husband, so you kind of put him in a bad light with his friends and I think he's feeling it. \n\nYou should also be truthful with his friends and not just ditch them for no reason just tell him you need some alone time feel overwhelmed you don't like going out everyday multiple time today. If they're real friends it shouldn't be much of a problem.\n\nOtherwise your lack of communication will cause major issues in the future.", "NTA for wanting to spend less time out and just relax at home. You just need to communicate this to your husband and your friends.\n\nThe friends sound lovely and should be understanding of this, I would make sure they know you appreciate the effort they put in and how welcoming they are. \n\nHusband is a bit of an AH for not asking what makes you happy and dictating you to go out all the time.", "NTA, but it sounds like you\u2019re feeling depressed and isolated since you moved.

Be kind to yourself.", "Cancelling or declining invitations? Declining, NTA. Cancelling last minute because you couldn't bring yourself to decline? YTA (though we Americans are pretty flaky when it comes to social appointments, so not a big one.) If your husband's goal is to help you, and you communicate that this type of help is not indeed helping, he should be respectful of that and switch gears by asking you how he can help, rather than prescribing solutions for you. It makes sense that his way of trying to solve your problems without including you makes you feel infantilized. Already, by moving to a foreign country for him, a big part of your independence has been sacrificed. You don't need anymore pressure to do things according to others' plans.", "Communication is everything.
