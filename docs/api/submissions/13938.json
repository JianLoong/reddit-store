He had Gary for six years and he was very close to him. Gary died after being sick for months and my husband says that he saw his last breath. After Gary's death, my husband used to listen to Sia's song \"Breathe me\", and every time he listens to that song, he's reminded of Gary.\n\nYesterday was my niece's 9th birthday, and my whole family gathered to celebrate for her. We were at my sister's backyard, and inside her house the TV was open on some music channel, but you could barely hear anything outside with all the talking. When my sister's husbund came with the birthday cake and everyone were singing and taking pictures, I saw that my husband had his eyes closed and was on the brink of tears. I was quite confused at first, but then I heard \"Breathe me\" playing in the background. I nudged him and told him that it's not the time for it and that everyone's taking pictures. He simply looked at me, slightly disappointed, and then faked being happy for my niece.\n\nOn our way home, he brought that up and said that I ruined his moment, and that he wasn't going to show up in any of the pictures or videos anyway because we sat on the other side of the table. I told him that I think he should get over his bunny already. I mean, it's been 7 years, and it's just a bunny, not a cat or a dog. But what he told me next made me feel like I was a bit too insensitive with him. He said that he wasn't mourning Gary's death, he simply got emotional from listening to that song again after a long time and recalling some of his old memories. I'm still not sure if it was the right time to get emotional when everyone were celebrating, but I understand that he had a special moment there. Was I supposed to leave him alone and let him have his moment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I told my husband that I wrote this post and he asked me to put this 3D photo of Gary: [https://imgur.com/a/VonDBCm](https://imgur.com/a/VonDBCm)", "created_utc": 1680557978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ayuar/aita_for_ruining_my_husbands_special_moment/", "score": 407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was a fresh loss I would have some sympathy but it's not. It's been long enough that he should be able to push it aside and focus on the moment, come back to it later if he needs or wants to. He needs to learn that it's not always appropriate to mourn right in that moment. And honestly, it's still mourning, not just \"getting emotional.\"\n\nOn the other side, it doesn't matter that it was a bunny, that doesn't mean the bond was any less than one can have with a  cat or dog.

You've obviously never interacted with a rabbit. Rabbits have just as much personality as cats and dogs. They can learn tricks. They are social animals and can form deep bonds with other rabbits. They don't belong in cages to be ignored all day. Why do you think they are less? Because they don't bark or meow? Because they're prey animals? If you didn't know better, well now you do.", "YTA.

My girlfriend lost her bunny and it's been extremely difficult for her. \n\nAlso, it's not like he went and put the song on to have a moment, it probably caught him off guard. Those moments can be difficult to push through, especially if you weren't prepared.", "YTA. People who truly care for their pets grieve when they\u2019re gone. There\u2019s no time limit on grief.

Music is one of the things that can still poke through and brings a lot of emotions and feelings to the surface.", "Sorry but Gary is a great name for a rabbit. If you ever get another can you call him Keith?\n\nWe all lose pets at some time or another, it's just something we have to deal with and after 7 years your husband shouldn't still be acting like that, I'm sure he loved Gary and vice versa but he's an adult and I think you were very much in the right on this occasion.", "Eh.. this is a tough one. I believe he could do better.

With a feeling like that too, seemed like he just needed to ride it out, and you calling him on it probably just made it worse", "YTA, \"just a bunny\" and \"get over it already\" are things someone with no empathy says when someone else cares about something and the speaker neither cares at all about the subject nor about the emotions of the person they're talking to.  In that moment, whether he says this to you or not, you broke your husband's ability to be vulnerable with you about his feelings - man, sucks to be him right now.", "Yes, YTA. Policing his emotions when they aren't affecting anyone else is unkind. It might have just been a bunny, but if Gary meant that much to your husband, why would you degrade his memory? No one benefits from you doing this. \n\nRIP Gary. Losing pets absolutely sucks.", "YTA. First of all, any pet's death can be significant even if it isn't a mainstream pet like a cat or a dog. And you don't get to control when you get emotional. That song holds alot of memories for him. Your comments were insensitive. He was just taking a moment, and being emotionally intelligent, which doesn't happen often with most people.", "YTA. People grieve differently and grief is not linear. Absolutely your husband deserved his moment. He didn\u2019t cause a scene and or take eyes off the birthday girl. He was just quietly in the background. He deserves an apology.", "YTA. You can't schedule grieving and emotions. Also a bunny is not any less than a cat or a dog...", "YTA for minimizing your husband's feelings and invalidating them.

What\u2019s your point here? \n\nIt\u2019s the emotional connection he had to his pet?! He\u2019s fondly remembering his friend? You\u2019re totally invalidating his feelings in a very strange and cruel way. You could\u2019ve easily said something nice to calm him down, but you choose to be mean.\n\nIf you had pet bird that you loved to death, and you were reminded of it one day years later.

Wtf?\n\nYTA", "YTA; it's a song that means a lot to him and reminds him of his beloved pet.

I'm split on this because I think he could be further along past emotional triggers but also, in your case, consideration costs nothing.", "YTA, how would you feel if a beloved pet of yours passed away and your emotions are being ignored and not understood by your significant other. He had every right to be disappointed in you and bring it up later for discussion. I think you were being disrespectful.", "YTA.", "YTA, why are you attacking him for being a human with human emotions", "YTA for being so dismissive, even in writing this post, and cuz it sounds like the dude was quietly having a moment of grief and sadness. Doesn\u2019t sound like he was ruining anything or that anyone else even noticed, and I don\u2019t know how much we can control being overcome by sadness. I doubt he wanted to feel that way in that moment either", "YTA. He was just having a moment without interrupting anyone. It's alright to feel sad every once in a while at the loss of someone you loved. You could have just wrapped your arm around him to show that you care. He would have snapped out of it in a couple of minutes. You didn't have to dismiss his emotions like that.", "YTA - You don't get to decide when he is done grieving.", "YTA for insinuating that Gary\u2019s death is any less important or impactful just because he\u2019s not a more \u201ccommon\u201d pet like a cat or a dog, as well as being so insensitive and dismissive of your husband\u2019s feelings in general. It\u2019s been over a year since I had to put my dog down, and I still get emotional when I think about him. He was absolutely the best boy. In fact, reading this post made me think about how much I miss him.

One of the worst parts of grieving the loss of a pet is that people don\u2019t take your grief seriously and expect you to \u201cjust move on.\u201d My pets are members of my family, and losing one is devastating. Grief is not a linear thing, and I can\u2019t imagine ever telling someone I care about to just get over something that makes them sad or emotional.", "YTA for what you said in the car, and the way you said it.\n\nYou're correct that the kids birthday was not the time.\n\nHe sounds like he needs a bit of extra help, from a professional, to process his grief.", "YTA for saying \"its not time for it and everybody is taking pictures\". Grief has no timeframe. With any sort of loss its gross to tell people to get over it. You don't get to judge his grief because Gary was \"just a bunny\" to you when he was clearly very important to your husband. The intensity of the grief has more to do with the love the grieving person has for the deceased than it does the species of the deceased.", "Christ, dude probably needs some therapy, but you should also never tell your partner to \u201cget over\u201d something.

Would seem a bit insensitive, wouldn\u2019t it?", "YTA, yes you should have left him alone.", "NTA about 'ruining the moment', but YTA for the \"it's just a bunny\" comment. You don't get to decide which pets are worthy of emotional attachment.", "It amazes me how many NTA responses their are on this post. You are a major asshole. You told your husband to get over a beloved pet he has had for YEARS and that it wasn't as important as a cat or dog. Your husband DID NOT create a scene, so I'm not sure why you felt the need to talk to him they way you did. I hope you never have pets because if that's the mentality you have, you won't be a good pet owner. Your husband had a moment of sadness, and rather than be understanding or caring, you essentially told him to man up because both of you were at a child's party. You invalidated his grief and made him feel terrible. Shame on you and shame on the other posters here saying that OP isn't an asshole for her response.", "NTA. This was not the time and place to possibly ruin someone else's celebration.
