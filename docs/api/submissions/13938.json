He had Gary for six years and he was very close to him. Gary died after being sick for months and my husband says that he saw his last breath. After Gary's death, my husband used to listen to Sia's song \"Breathe me\", and every time he listens to that song, he's reminded of Gary.\n\nYesterday was my niece's 9th birthday, and my whole family gathered to celebrate for her. We were at my sister's backyard, and inside her house the TV was open on some music channel, but you could barely hear anything outside with all the talking. When my sister's husbund came with the birthday cake and everyone were singing and taking pictures, I saw that my husband had his eyes closed and was on the brink of tears. I was quite confused at first, but then I heard \"Breathe me\" playing in the background. I nudged him and told him that it's not the time for it and that everyone's taking pictures. He simply looked at me, slightly disappointed, and then faked being happy for my niece.\n\nOn our way home, he brought that up and said that I ruined his moment, and that he wasn't going to show up in any of the pictures or videos anyway because we sat on the other side of the table. I told him that I think he should get over his bunny already. I mean, it's been 7 years, and it's just a bunny, not a cat or a dog. But what he told me next made me feel like I was a bit too insensitive with him. He said that he wasn't mourning Gary's death, he simply got emotional from listening to that song again after a long time and recalling some of his old memories. I'm still not sure if it was the right time to get emotional when everyone were celebrating, but I understand that he had a special moment there. Was I supposed to leave him alone and let him have his moment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I told my husband that I wrote this post and he asked me to put this 3D photo of Gary: [https://imgur.com/a/VonDBCm](https://imgur.com/a/VonDBCm)", "created_utc": 1680557978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ayuar/aita_for_ruining_my_husbands_special_moment/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was a fresh loss I would have some sympathy but it's not. It's been long enough that he should be able to push it aside and focus on the moment, come back to it later if he needs or wants to. He needs to learn that it's not always appropriate to mourn right in that moment. And honestly, it's still mourning, not just \"getting emotional.\"\n\nOn the other side, it doesn't matter that it was a bunny, that doesn't mean the bond was any less than one can have with a  cat or dog.

You've obviously never interacted with a rabbit. Rabbits have just as much personality as cats and dogs. They can learn tricks. They are social animals and can form deep bonds with other rabbits. They don't belong in cages to be ignored all day. Why do you think they are less? Because they don't bark or meow? Because they're prey animals? If you didn't know better, well now you do.", "YTA. He wasn't bothering anyone but you. Let the man remember his pet.", "YTA. Who are you to decide when it's time for someone to stop grieving? My girlfriend lost her bunny and it's been extremely difficult for her. \n\nAlso, it's not like he went and put the song on to have a moment, it probably caught him off guard. Those moments can be difficult to push through, especially if you weren't prepared.", "YTA. People who truly care for their pets grieve when they\u2019re gone. There\u2019s no time limit on grief.

Music is one of the things that can still poke through and brings a lot of emotions and feelings to the surface.", "Sorry but Gary is a great name for a rabbit. If you ever get another can you call him Keith?\n\nWe all lose pets at some time or another, it's just something we have to deal with and after 7 years your husband shouldn't still be acting like that, I'm sure he loved Gary and vice versa but he's an adult and I think you were very much in the right on this occasion.", "Eh.. this is a tough one. I believe he could do better.

With a feeling like that too, seemed like he just needed to ride it out, and you calling him on it probably just made it worse", "YTA, \"just a bunny\" and \"get over it already\" are things someone with no empathy says when someone else cares about something and the speaker neither cares at all about the subject nor about the emotions of the person they're talking to.  In that moment, whether he says this to you or not, you broke your husband's ability to be vulnerable with you about his feelings - man, sucks to be him right now.", "Yes, YTA. Policing his emotions when they aren't affecting anyone else is unkind. It might have just been a bunny, but if Gary meant that much to your husband, why would you degrade his memory? No one benefits from you doing this. \n\nRIP Gary. Losing pets absolutely sucks.", "YTA. First of all, any pet's death can be significant even if it isn't a mainstream pet like a cat or a dog. And you don't get to control when you get emotional. That song holds alot of memories for him. Your comments were insensitive. He was just taking a moment, and being emotionally intelligent, which doesn't happen often with most people.", "YTA. People grieve differently and grief is not linear. Absolutely your husband deserved his moment. He didn\u2019t cause a scene and or take eyes off the birthday girl. He was just quietly in the background. He deserves an apology.", "YTA. You can't schedule grieving and emotions. Also a bunny is not any less than a cat or a dog...", "YTA for minimizing your husband's feelings and invalidating them.

What\u2019s your point here? \n\nIt\u2019s the emotional connection he had to his pet?! He\u2019s fondly remembering his friend? You\u2019re totally invalidating his feelings in a very strange and cruel way. You could\u2019ve easily said something nice to calm him down, but you choose to be mean.\n\nIf you had pet bird that you loved to death, and you were reminded of it one day years later.

Wtf?\n\nYTA", "YTA; it's a song that means a lot to him and reminds him of his beloved pet.

I'm split on this because I think he could be further along past emotional triggers but also, in your case, consideration costs nothing.", "YTA, how would you feel if a beloved pet of yours passed away and your emotions are being ignored and not understood by your significant other. He had every right to be disappointed in you and bring it up later for discussion. I think you were being disrespectful.", "YTA.", "YTA, why are you attacking him for being a human with human emotions", "YTA for being so dismissive, even in writing this post, and cuz it sounds like the dude was quietly having a moment of grief and sadness. Doesn\u2019t sound like he was ruining anything or that anyone else even noticed, and I don\u2019t know how much we can control being overcome by sadness. I doubt he wanted to feel that way in that moment either", "YTA. He was just having a moment without interrupting anyone. It's alright to feel sad every once in a while at the loss of someone you loved. You could have just wrapped your arm around him to show that you care. He would have snapped out of it in a couple of minutes. You didn't have to dismiss his emotions like that.", "YTA - You don't get to decide when he is done grieving.", "YTA for insinuating that Gary\u2019s death is any less important or impactful just because he\u2019s not a more \u201ccommon\u201d pet like a cat or a dog, as well as being so insensitive and dismissive of your husband\u2019s feelings in general. It\u2019s been over a year since I had to put my dog down, and I still get emotional when I think about him. He was absolutely the best boy. In fact, reading this post made me think about how much I miss him.

One of the worst parts of grieving the loss of a pet is that people don\u2019t take your grief seriously and expect you to \u201cjust move on.\u201d My pets are members of my family, and losing one is devastating. Grief is not a linear thing, and I can\u2019t imagine ever telling someone I care about to just get over something that makes them sad or emotional.", "YTA for what you said in the car, and the way you said it.\n\nYou're correct that the kids birthday was not the time.\n\nHe sounds like he needs a bit of extra help, from a professional, to process his grief.", "YTA for saying \"its not time for it and everybody is taking pictures\". Grief has no timeframe. With any sort of loss its gross to tell people to get over it. You don't get to judge his grief because Gary was \"just a bunny\" to you when he was clearly very important to your husband. The intensity of the grief has more to do with the love the grieving person has for the deceased than it does the species of the deceased.", "Christ, dude probably needs some therapy, but you should also never tell your partner to \u201cget over\u201d something.

Would seem a bit insensitive, wouldn\u2019t it?", "YTA, yes you should have left him alone.", "NTA about 'ruining the moment', but YTA for the \"it's just a bunny\" comment. You don't get to decide which pets are worthy of emotional attachment.", "It amazes me how many NTA responses their are on this post. You are a major asshole. You told your husband to get over a beloved pet he has had for YEARS and that it wasn't as important as a cat or dog. Your husband DID NOT create a scene, so I'm not sure why you felt the need to talk to him they way you did. I hope you never have pets because if that's the mentality you have, you won't be a good pet owner. Your husband had a moment of sadness, and rather than be understanding or caring, you essentially told him to man up because both of you were at a child's party. You invalidated his grief and made him feel terrible. Shame on you and shame on the other posters here saying that OP isn't an asshole for her response.", "NTA. This was not the time and place to possibly ruin someone else's celebration.

If you don't understand or care about someones grief (regardless of who the deceased is) you shouldn't speak to them about it because it can be more harmful than helpful.", "I may have not been clear enough about it. He said that he wasn't grivieng his rabbit, that's just what I was thinking. Instead, he just wanted to continue listenting to that song because it had brought him some memories of his childhood, not necessarily related to Gary.", "Yep, that's what did it for me.", "Yes, that comment was out of order. It was still a loving pet, it doesn't matter what breed of animal. \n\nEdit; removed my comment about OP's grief after reading another comment I agree with, and I no longer agree with what I wrote.", "I don\u2019t disagree with the vast majority of what you said, and as someone whose heart has been broken by the loss of a pet, I sympathize. But I just don\u2019t see the reaction as appropriate, and I think the person is in need of assistance. Chacun a son gout.", "I think that's why I lean ESH. She's being very dismissive of his very real feelings.\n\nBut I also feel like he should get some grief counseling? Someday people he loves will die and if he's feeling the loss of a beloved pet this much ~~10~~ 7 years later? He's going to have a terrible time without getting some extra tools in his tool belt.", "I lost my brother to suicide while he was living with us, I'm the one who found him and it's an image I'll never forget. I still wonder if there was something I could've done, though I logically know he was bipolar and suffered PTSD from his multiple tours in Iraq. I definitely have things that will trigger me, but I'd never want it to interfere with other people celebrating. I'd welcome my wife pointing it out and I'd step away if needed.", "In this case, however, it was noticed.  By OP.  And it wasn't that she heard the song, and checked to see if he was okay.  He was visibly distressed, and she only made the connection to the song after she tried to figure out what was causing his distress.\n\nAnd if OP could notice, other adults could too.  Even if they had the manners not to comment.  We hope the birthday child didn't notice, because it would be confusing and distressing to a child to see someone visibly sad and fighting back tears at their birthday party.  \n\nEmotional regulation is a thing that adults need to manage. The husband needs to be able to control his initial reaction, excuse himself if necessary, and develop coping methods to get through moments of emotion in a way that is appropriate for the setting they are in.", "I just think it's a good name for a rabbit.", "Emotionally underdeveloped includes not being able to regulate them.", "Wildly unable to manage emotions after 7 years??? Nah. This man needs to learn effective coping techniques related to grief. Everyone in the world has lost someone or a pet they love. It shouldn't be affecting him this badly after 7 years.", "You have to find a good balance. I was raised not to show any \u201cnegative\u201d or serious emotions, but I wanted to work through that and parent differently. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t know how to handle expressing emotions in a healthy way, and I just thought that it meant that I could let my emotions rule most situations, and that there was no inappropriate time to be focused on myself and my emotions. Op\u2019s partner sounds like he operates in that manner in regards to his grief over his deceased pet, and that behavior is rarely isolated to just one subject of grief. \n\nThere are healthy ways to express grief, and unhealthy ones that keep you frequently stuck in misery 7 years later. Op could have been gentler with her confrontation, but her partner is also unfairly putting those around him through his unresolved grief 7 years later. My guess is that this is not the first time that op has felt like her partner has tried to inappropriately express his grief, either due to the situation or intensity of that grief. Op was harsh, but she isn\u2019t wrong. \n\nEmpathy fatigue is a real thing when dealing with people who refuse to try to move on from trauma. I have been that person unable to move on, and people rightfully get sick of your shit and having positive moments ruined because you don\u2019t deal with trauma. I wish that someone would have gently told me that I was alienating myself and my partner from social groups, by being so self focused during other\u2019s moments while I tried to figure out appropriate expressions of emotion. \n\nESH", "rabbits are complex animals capable of forming deep emotional bonds, and can live to the age of twelve or more if looked after well (and they don't develop health issues). I've had rabbits in the past and have three dogs now, and I loved those rabbits every bit as much as I love my dogs. your husband should have excused himself to be emotional in private, probably, but you need to grow some empathy honestly.", "It sounds like your husband's bunny helped him a lot in his life. Some animals in our lives end up being all we have for a time. Was he very lonely during this time of his life maybe?", "that's totally what I think to!! I would actively not be a part of their life and probably leave them because they were too apathetic", "That\u2019s WORSE! So you won\u2019t even let him have a few fucking mins to himself? How completely self absorbed are you? Wow I thought you were the AH originally, but youre 10x worse than I thought before.. YOU ARE RUINING SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR SOMEONE YOU CLAIM TO LOVE. It\u2019s a fact.", "That's almost worse imo. I understand moments of grief randomly hitting you (I lost my mom unexpectedly in my early 20s), but being so nostalgic that you start to almost cry at a child's birthday party isn't normal. If he couldn't control himself, he should have excused himself and gone to the bathroom. Did he have a traumatic childhood or something happen that would bring up particularly strong emotions? Has he always had trouble regulating his emotions?", "A humans death is not automatically more significant to a grieving person than an animals death. It has more to do with the connection between the deceased and the griever. \n\nTaking a moment to quietly remember his deceased loved one when a song that sparked a memory comes on does not indicate to me that he is struggling and needs help. Even if he does need help that doesn't mean he sucks.\n\nOP sucks for being so callous and dismissive  towards her husband. If he was dealing with complex grief this could sink him further into the grief and isolation. The feelings of loss coupled with his spouse blatently implying she doesn't care about his feelings on the subject is not helping him.", "Yeah, I wonder if the pain is due to unresolved issues, but I still have bittersweet moments for list moments and friends/creatures/relatives.\nThere are also a lot of people out there who mourn pets more heavily due to their belief systems. I love seen people lose it over pets and take the loss of a parent in stride. One was innocent and didn't understand what ,  one was elderly, infirm & welcomed the transition.\nThere are also people who believe pets don't have souls. I'm spiritual and would be absolutely devastated if I believed my lost pets didn't get to continue on in some way. \nJust putting some thoughts out tthere.", "... Is your name Keith?", "... Are you a rabbit?", "Yep, my son has 2 that are fixed and run freely around his house. They\u2019re pretty much just like his cats.", "That\u2019s what I was going to say. OP\u2019s explanation makes it worse. (My condolences for your mother).", "Wtf kind of world are we going into that we can now say a bunny\u2019s death is not \u201cautomatically less than a grief of a human\u201d? I hate people saying that the world is becoming \u201ctoo woke\u201d but that\u2019s a joke. A humans life is worth way more than a bunny\u2019s, and the grief from a humans death is way more than a bunny\u2019s. or any animal\u2019s. \n\nI can\u2019t wrap my mind around how you think that. I LOVE my cats, and I will mourn their deaths, but I will never compare a loss of them to a loss of a relative or loved one. It\u2019s just not comparable. Grieving a bunny after seven years is insane."]}
