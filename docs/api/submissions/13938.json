He had Gary for six years and he was very close to him. Gary died after being sick for months and my husband says that he saw his last breath. After Gary's death, my husband used to listen to Sia's song \"Breathe me\", and every time he listens to that song, he's reminded of Gary.\n\nYesterday was my niece's 9th birthday, and my whole family gathered to celebrate for her. We were at my sister's backyard, and inside her house the TV was open on some music channel, but you could barely hear anything outside with all the talking. When my sister's husband came with the birthday cake and everyone were singing and taking pictures, I saw that my husband had his eyes closed and was on the brink of tears. I was quite confused at first, but then I heard \"Breathe me\" playing in the background. I nudged him and told him that it's not the time for it and that everyone's taking pictures. He simply looked at me, slightly disappointed, and then faked being happy for my niece.\n\nOn our way home, he brought that up and said that I ruined his moment, and that he wasn't going to show up in any of the pictures or videos anyway because we sat on the other side of the table. I told him that I think he should get over his bunny already. I mean, it's been 7 years, and it's just a bunny, not a cat or a dog. But what he told me next made me feel like I was a bit too insensitive with him. He said that he wasn't mourning Gary's death, he simply got emotional from listening to that song again after a long time and recalling some of his old memories. I'm still not sure if it was the right time to get emotional when everyone were celebrating, but I understand that he had a special moment there. Was I supposed to leave him alone and let him have his moment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I told my husband that I wrote this post and he asked me to put this 3D photo of Gary: [https://imgur.com/a/VonDBCm](https://imgur.com/a/VonDBCm)\n\nEDIT 2: I think some of you are making out assumptions and taking this situation out of proportions. I thought that I made it clear in my comments, but apparently not. First, my husband didn't cry at any point, and wasn't even grieving. He was simply reminiscing with his eyes closed, listening to that song. It was ME who thought that he was grieving. Second, comparing bunnies to cats and dogs was a mistake, they're no less of a pet.", "created_utc": 1680557978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ayuar/aita_for_ruining_my_husbands_special_moment/", "score": 1224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was a fresh loss I would have some sympathy but it's not. It's been long enough that he should be able to push it aside and focus on the moment, come back to it later if he needs or wants to.

You've obviously never interacted with a rabbit. Rabbits have just as much personality as cats and dogs. They can learn tricks. They are social animals and can form deep bonds with other rabbits.

If you ever get another can you call him Keith?\n\nWe all lose pets at some time or another, it's just something we have to deal with and after 7 years your husband shouldn't still be acting like that, I'm sure he loved Gary and vice versa but he's an adult and I think you were very much in the right on this occasion.", "Eh.. this is a tough one. I believe he could do better.

In that moment, whether he says this to you or not, you broke your husband's ability to be vulnerable with you about his feelings - man, sucks to be him right now.", "Yes, YTA.

I'm split on this because I think he could be further along past emotional triggers but also, in your case, consideration costs nothing.", "YTA, how would you feel if a beloved pet of yours passed away and your emotions are being ignored and not understood by your significant other.

I doubt he wanted to feel that way in that moment either", "YTA. He was just having a moment without interrupting anyone.

It\u2019s been over a year since I had to put my dog down, and I still get emotional when I think about him. He was absolutely the best boy.

One of the worst parts of grieving the loss of a pet is that people don\u2019t take your grief seriously and expect you to \u201cjust move on.\u201d My pets are members of my family, and losing one is devastating. Grief is not a linear thing, and I can\u2019t imagine ever telling someone I care about to just get over something that makes them sad or emotional.", "YTA for what you said in the car, and the way you said it.\n\nYou're correct that the kids birthday was not the time.\n\nHe sounds like he needs a bit of extra help, from a professional, to process his grief.", "YTA for saying \"its not time for it and everybody is taking pictures\". Grief has no timeframe. With any sort of loss its gross to tell people to get over it. You don't get to judge his grief because Gary was \"just a bunny\" to you when he was clearly very important to your husband. The intensity of the grief has more to do with the love the grieving person has for the deceased than it does the species of the deceased.", "Christ, dude probably needs some therapy, but you should also never tell your partner to \u201cget over\u201d something.

You told your husband to get over a beloved pet he has had for YEARS and that it wasn't as important as a cat or dog. Your husband DID NOT create a scene, so I'm not sure why you felt the need to talk to him they way you did. I hope you never have pets because if that's the mentality you have, you won't be a good pet owner. Your husband had a moment of sadness, and rather than be understanding or caring, you essentially told him to man up because both of you were at a child's party.

He can't help that. And if you caught him right as it hit him, you didn't really give him much time to shrug it off.
