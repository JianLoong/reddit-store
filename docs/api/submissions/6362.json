Not only is she persistent in this attempt, but she basically demands it. Last time I was over there she kept pestering me to take a nap so she could watch my baby. Which seems like a nice gesture, but after seeing how she was with my baby last time I was over (forgetting a few times to support her head, having a hard time getting off the couch with her, ect) I was extremely nervous and didn't feel comfortable with the idea. However, I finally conceded. Maybe she had a better grasp of it now since my husband (30M) talked to her? \n\nBefore I left my daughter in her care she told us, \"(father-in-law) and I have two college degrees. We got this.\" \n\nIt was torture listening to my daughter cry and not being able to get up to help, or at least feeling like it would cause problems if I did so. My husband had basically told me I needed to sleep as well, and i felt outnumbered. An hour went by and I couldn't take it anymore, so I got up. \n\nHer diaper was on backwards and her pants were off, because they couldn't figure out how to put them back on. My daughter promptly peed all over herself because of the backward diaper when I went to change it. \n\nShe keeps mentioning watching her alone, again. But that incident, along with some others, pissed me off. \n\nFor example, my baby was moving around in her portable bassinet. I am a little nervous about this one as it doesn't have mesh sides, and so while she is in it, I constantly observe her or go check on her when I hear her shifting. When I got up to check on her, my mother-in-law says abruptly, \"she is fine\". As in, there is no need to check on her, so sit back down. Don't tell me what I can and cannot do for my child. \n\nShe was also talking about sleep training and telling me I should only change my baby's diaper unless it is absolutely necessary at night according to some facebook article. That is a quick way to a diaper rash. \n\nSo, needless to say, don't trust her. \n\nMy parents (52F, 55M), on the other hand, I trust 100%. I have observed them with my daughter and they know exactly what to do, how to interact with her, etc. They are pros at this. And so I let my dad watch her Friday evenings so my husband and I can go on date nights. My mom comes over during the week a time or two to help me watch her while I do chores, or if we have had a really bad night. \n\nAnd I feel a little guilty sometimes because I know my mother-in-law wants to be just as involved. I try to take my daughter to see her at least once a week. But I don't trust her alone with my daughter when she is this young, and I think that hurts her feelings.", "created_utc": 1672732397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1021xkk/wibta_for_not_letting_my_motherinlaw_babysit/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sure ur more comfy with ur parents because they raised you, and you\u2019ve seen them doing things correctly. Is she the type that just wants to hold the baby to help you? Maybe ur mom is more helpful with chores cooking cleaning and baby time so you are noticing the differences in other ways too? Before baby was ur relationship with them decent? If it\u2019s the first grandchild they really do need to learn that things have changed ALOT since they had children and them saying they both have college degrees?

Your baby is not a doll. Nobody gets to play house just because they\u2019re being aggressive about it. \n\nYour parents and in-laws have already had their babies.

If she is unable to take care of your daughter in an efficient manner, then she should not take care of her. It\u2019s ridiculous that both she and her husband were unable to do a simple diaper change properly.

You are your child\u2019s mother, and if, for any reason, you don\u2019t want someone watching her, then they should not watch her. You shouldn\u2019t give in because of guilt or your perceived obligations to let your MIL spend time with your daughter.", "I would never ever in 100 years feel guilty about protecting your daughter from incompetent people.

Your MIL is dangerous and is putting your little one in danger every single time she's around your child, and the worst thing is that she cares more about being right than the kid's wellbeing.\n\nThere have been several posts of negligent family members babysitting kids in this and other subs (including one of a grandma that left a young toddler near a pond by themselves, where the toddler fell and died), enough to be wary of these type of people.\n\nYour MIL sounds equally irresponsible, entitled and selfish, so TBH, even if it causes issues, I think you should not allow them to be alone with your kid ever.
