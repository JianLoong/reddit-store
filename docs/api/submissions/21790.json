NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right that the dog should be leashed if it can't be recalled. Not only is it a safety hazard for others, it's a serious safety risk for the dog. As they can't even hear if a car is coming. \n\nSome people just shouldn't have pets honestly.", "NTA. The law is the law. I agree, a dig shouldn't be off leash unless gated on property or can be recalled back. It's a safety Hazzard, idc if said dig is a good boy and is sweet. Anything can happen.

I have a Golden Retriever who is the friendliest, goofiest, softest dog on the planet but I never have him off lead. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him, I just don\u2019t trust other dogs. You never know how another dog will react or how quickly things will escalate and someone gets hurt.

If the dog is deaf and cannot be recalled then it's not under control unless it's on a lead.", "He needs a leash BECAUSE he\u2019s deaf.  Are there not leash laws in the UK?  NTA", "If that had happened while my (rather anxious) dog had been on leash he would have had a very aggressive reaction. Which is why he was on leash in the first place. NTA.", "The UK laws require dogs to be under control and a deaf dog is not under control if they're off-leash. My parents' dog isn't deaf but has dodgy recall (husky mix) so we are very careful about keeping him leashed so we can avoid situations like yours. \n\nAbsolutely NTA and she needs to sort herself out before a dog or person gets injured", "NTA. You weren\u2019t rude, you were being responsible. \n\nIf her dog is deaf then it not only can\u2019t be recalled but also can\u2019t rely on sound to know whether it\u2019s in danger - like a car coming behind it. \n\nAlso worth noting that in the UK there\u2019s the Dangerous Dog Act. It\u2019s worded in such a way that any dog deemed dangerous *will* be put down. There\u2019s no leniency in the wording. So if her dog got scared and lashed out at a child, her negligence at keeping it on a lead would result in her dog being put down. \n\nMy dog is incredibly nervous around pretty much every other breed of dog. She also has zero recall. We don\u2019t let her off the lead unless it\u2019s an enclosed space we have control over. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of crappy dog owners we\u2019ve met who think it\u2019s fine to let their dog run off-lead and then do nothing to try to control them.", "\"It's not my problem if people can't control their dogs\"\n\nShe says as she doesn't even attempt to control her dog\n\nNTA\n\nMy parents have a deaf dog and even when on family property, he's always leashed unless inside or at least in a fenced area", "We have control laws instead, dogs must be kept under close control (either leash or verbal) with specifics areas designated as \"dogs must be on leash\"", "So she violated the control law.

You don't know if she was telling the truth about her dog and if she was that's all the more reason she should keep it leashed. It's her dog that wasn't being controlled, as she quite deliberately let it roam free. And she was obviously the one who was inconsiderate. NTA  \nShe's a crazy woman.", "My dog has the best recall, I still keep him on leash. It's for his safety. He can have amazing recall and still ignore me at any point for something that's high enough of a reward, no dog is 100%. And because hes 120-130 lbs, he's attacked often by off leash dogs even if he is ignoring them. I need to be able to have him under complete control to protect him, a leash provides that where recall works on mutual respect and that's not good enough for me."]}
