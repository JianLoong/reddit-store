I had forgotten I had put it there as Beth sat down in the passengers seat and failed to mention it.\n\nMy nephew suddenly started crying in his seat because he couldn\u2019t find the toy and that\u2019s when I remembered that I left it on the passenger seat. I was gonna ask Beth to hand it to him but she shook her head at me. \n\nShe was all like \u201cyou can do it, let it pass.

She got frustrated and said she read a book about it and if I give into him then he\u2019ll cry every time he wants something. I told her that he\u2019s just panicked because he adores that specific toy and I promised him it would be safe in the car but he can\u2019t find it so 1. His precious toy is missing and 2. He thinks I lied. \n\nShe told me to stop reaching and started ignoring me so I parked the car in the grocery store parking lot again and told her to get out and ask my brother or a friend for a ride because I\u2019m done. She was shocked but left after insisting that I\u2019m going to create a spoilt brat. My brain was exploding because my nephew was still crying so I ignored her and just grabbed the toy (she put it in the side pocket) and gave it to my nephew who was very grateful. \n\nShe very childishly flipped me off while I drove away and I thought that was it. But she sent me a screenshot of some article about manipulative child behaviour and my brother called me to ask if she was telling the truth about what I did.

Your SIL is an idiot who sent an article, not loads of scientific data to restate her opinion. This is failed circular logic.

He is crying because he wants something, no one is questioning that. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget as an adult, but a three year old is still learning to understand different emotions and JUST figuring out how to identify their emotions. But that does not mean they have emotional regulation skills! Crying is the one thing that they know gets them what they want. When they\u2019re overwhelmed or upset, they\u2019re gonna cry to get what they need. It\u2019s not manipulation, it\u2019s the anticipated response at this stage in childhood development. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any issue with having the toy! He is not screaming constantly in the car, throwing his toy and expecting someone to get it, or anything else disruptive! She hid his toy so he freaked, which again, is a developmentally appropriate response \n\nHer disdain for kids is concerning and I genuinely would not leave her alone with any child.", "NTA.  It's not like he's throwing a tantrum because he doesn't want to eat vegetables or because you said no to an expensive trip to disneyland.  Passing a kid a toy is such a minor courtesy.

Does she think a grumbling stomach is manipulative too? Crying is a physical response important like hunger. What a psycho.", "NTA. Listen, I am childfree. I would give a BABY his toy.

Well 1 each kid is different. 2 it isn\u2019t my place 3 most importantly parents deal with their kids 24/7, they are in the trenches. They are picking their battles. They are exhausted. They are always trying to figure out if they are screwing up their kids.
