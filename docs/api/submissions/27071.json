She sounds insecure, it\u2019s a picture from a big event in your past. She needs to get over that, like someone else said, it\u2019s not like you have it in a frame in your lounge, it\u2019s literally in your basement. That\u2019s not an issue at all. You\u2019re entitled to keep memories if you want to", "NTA - it\u2019s your PROM pic. She\u2019s immature and needs to get over herself. Either that or WYBTA if you stay with her.", "NTA!  She\u2019s insecure AF.  Is she going to worry about your middle school dance too?", "NTA. It\u2019s a happy memory from your past. You didn\u2019t grow up in a vacuum.  I would be concerned about being with someone so insecure that they can\u2019t handle a simple picture from your past. The insecurity tends to eat relationships alive.", "NTA and don't destroy your photo. It's ridiculous that your girlfriend would ask you to do this and you shouldn't have to pretend that you didn't have your own life before you met her. That's just absurd.", "Nta and red flags", "NTA.  It's your prom photo, which is a fun memory from high school.  Her insecurity is worrisome, however.", "NTA. You have a right to have memories and stuff to keep them. If there were pill causing instant memory loss, would it be ok to ask your partner to take them each time you meet them? \n\nIf she's insecure about you having a past, it's very sad for her. But unless she asked for a virgin and you lied about it, she has no right to do an autodaf\u00e9 on your past life memories.", "NTA - This girl sounds crazy insecure to be worried about a prom picture. Is she the type that gets upset if you say hi to another woman?", "NTA I would maybe put those photos in a lockbox and get them scanned so you have digital backups. Maybe I've read too much of this sub or it's the horrified archivist in me. But this is kind of a flag. Of course you both have a past. You love a person, you love the experiences that made them into the person they are. She is bringing a weird puritan petals-on-a-flower mindset to this.", "NTA. Keeping it in the basement is fine. It's not like it's in a frame in the lounge. It's nice to have pictures to remind you of fun times. It doesn't mean you want have more fun times or even better times.", "NTA\n\nI get not wanting to see pictures of your partner with another person but it was a prom photo, it's not that deep. Look keep the photo and maybe give it to someone else (parents etc) who you trust to keep it safe and away from her line of vision. At least this way, you eat to keep your pic and also don't have to deal with her insecurities.", "She's jealous of a high school prom picture???\n\nThat's controlling, jealous, insecure... did she have a bowl of crazy for breakfast?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If she is insecure about a picture, daily life may become difficult soon enough. Will you be authorized to be friends with female coworkers, talk to female neighbors\u2026\n\nYou need to discuss this and she probably needs therapy to get over her insecurity. You can hide that picture if it helps her, but destroying it is not acceptable", "NTA, and she needs to grow up. That's just picking for a fight and being unreasonable on her part. If she can't view you as a person outside of your relationship independent with memories and a life story - then she's on some whack level shit.\n\nJeez, some women are really taking the piss.", "I've never heard of such a thing.   I didn't keep pics of my ex husband, but prom?  And it was my choice.  NTA.", "NTA for keeping your old prom photo.  However, hopefully you see the huge red flag that your GF is controlling and manipulative.  \n\n>she doesn't like that I have a photo of me with another woman in the house and wants me to cut it(it's the only paper copy)", "This is the thin end of the wedge. Get the photo where she can't destroy it and have at least one digital copy made and stored in the cloud. Erasing your past is just plain wrong, and your girlfriend is TA. I'd say ditch her controlling self, but that's just me. Nevertheless, preserve that photo!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We were both tall and ridiculously skinny (which is probably why he asked me) and I had no cleavage to speak of so my dress kept gaping open. Ugh.
