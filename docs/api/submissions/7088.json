Tim has a 9 year old child with his ex \u201cCandace\u201d. My sister has essentially been this child\u2019s stepmom for the past 7 years and spends more time with the child than either bio parents. \n\nMy sister has always wanted to be a mother. It was her greatest dream. When she first started dating Tim he said he was open to having more kids. Over time she fell in love with his kid and raised her as her own, but Tim later admitted he never actually wanted kids. \n\nMy sister was heartbroken. She didn\u2019t want to lose Tim or his child. They fought about this for quite some time. When she would try to break up with him he would say that had changed his mind. He did the same thing about marriage. He would say he was wanting to marry her and then he would backtrack. \n\nI have gotten countless phone calls over the years from my sister just sobbing over this. She is far too attached to his child to leave. The child has said that if my sister and Tim ever break up then she would rather live with my sister than either of her parents. \n\nYesterday my sister called about a dog that she wanted to adopt. Her last dog died and she\u2019s been very upset.  She has been looking at dogs to adopt with Tim for quite some time. I visited them and he was talking about it at length and she showed me dogs they had signed up to meet. However when she told Tim about this dog he was upset and started saying he never wanted to get another dog and thought looking at dogs was just to help her grieve. He claims he didn\u2019t think it was serious. She is the one who paid for all animal related expenses but suddenly he\u2019s upset about how much dogs cost as if she wasn\u2019t caring for her last dog for 15 years. \n\nShe was devastated by his response. He refuses to even meet the dog! She was told she has until today to decide if she will adopt him. Today is also my sister\u2019s birthday. The only thing she wants is for Tim to meet the dog but instead he is spending the entire day with his ex girlfriend Candace! He is helping her move houses. Candace hates my sister because she is stealing her role as her child\u2019s mom.\n\nI have sat by for years watching Tim treat my sister poorly and dangle his child over her head. Any time they fight he threatens to leave and says she will never see his child again. \n\nI sent him an angry text this today saying I was disappointed in him and how he treats my sister and that I was sick and tired of watching her give up her dreams only to be walked all over by him. I said it was wrong to spend my sister\u2019s birthday with a woman who hates her and that it was ridiculous he couldn\u2019t take an hour out of his day to come meet this dog. I said I understood that getting a dog is a huge decision and I didn\u2019t expect him to get it but that this issue was about more than that and it was about prioritizing your partner. I didn\u2019t use any foul language. \n\nHe told me my message was out of line and that he wasn\u2019t going to respond to it.

The action I took was sending a long angry text to my sister\u2019s long term boyfriend tell him that he needed to treat her better and prioritize her more as a partner. I said that spending her birthday with his ex girl friend was wrong and hurtful. I also said that it was unacceptable to constantly lead her on about having more children, getting married, and adopting a dog only to back track and change his mind every time and that he was being manipulative. He thinks I\u2019m the asshole because he considers me messaging him about that to be out of line. \n\n2. I think I may be the asshole because it\u2019s not really my place to meddle in their relationship and I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t appreciate receiving that text this morning when we rarely talk in the first place. I think I may not be the asshole because she is my sister and my best friend and I think he\u2019s been emotionally abusing her and manipulating her to get his way for far too long and no one ever calls him out on it. If she stands up for herself he threatens to take his child, who she loves deeply, away from her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know it's hard to watch a sister in an awful relationship, I watched my own go through years of abuse, but at the end of the day she's a grown up and she's got to be the one to say/do something about her situation and all you can really do is validate and support her, maybe ask leading questions to help her see through the fog, but outside of that you could do more damage than good.", "Look up future faking.
