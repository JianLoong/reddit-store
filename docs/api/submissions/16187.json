The doctor says its going to take a mircle for them to have kids since they recently found out the her husband is infertile. They told them it was better to look for other alterntives and maybe attend couples therapy to get through this hardpatch in their marrige.(they have been pointing fingers at whos fault it was) the options were1. Adoption or 2. Surrogracy they chose the 2nd option as her husband wants to continue the blood line with his own blood. (Their choice) so they were looking at a couple of opti9ns for surrogates with the doctor, what they didnt realize that ut would be pricey, so the doctor reccomended a family surrogate. So they did. They first aked her husbands sister, she declined. Now we didnt know why she declined they just had told us she did. They later asked an older cousin of ours, she agreed at first but later said no way. We were all confused as why she said yes and then no. We would later find out as they went and went through diffrent family members on both sides and they all declined. Later we the younger girls of our side of the family got involved. My cousin and her husband sat us down and asked straight out, if one of us would be their surrogate. Mind you were a group of teens the oldest being 18 f and the youngest 16 f. This is what they said in short term, \" we already asked your parents and they said no, but ot isnt their bodies its yours, please help us with this.\" We sat there stunned at what they were saying, out of respect we sat and listened to what they had to say, they told us if we agreed this would be the list of rules we had to follow: 1. No eating junk food 2. No eating anything thay isnt approved by the couple themselves 3. We had no say on how the birth was going to be 4. It was going to be a home birth 5. We had to move in straight after we got pregnant 6. We had to stayed glued to my cousin at all times7. After the baby was born we couldnt contact the baby until he/she turned 3.After they set the rules we were shocked. We all instantly told them no way in hell we were going to do it. They told us why not, we had our whole lives ahead of us and soon we would forget we even did this.

Their rules are super inappropriate and unnecessary. The whole thing is creepy and coercive and no effing way should they be approaching teenagers about it.", "NTA. No legitimate doctor would agree to it in the first place given your ages and I'm assuming most if not all of you have not carried a pregnancy to term without major complications.", "NTA. Honestly, they don't even sound fit to be parents. Surrogacy should be done with enthusiastic consent. Pregnancy takes a big toll on the body in the short term and the long term. No one should be badgered and harassed into doing it. \"No\" is a complete sentence. You don't owe anyone an explanation as to why you don't want to put your body on the line so that they can have a baby. Besides all of that, you are still a child yourself. At 17 you aren't completely grown and pregnancy can be disruptive of your own physical development. Even for fully grown adults, pregnancy is risky and complications can occur that affect you for the rest of your life. Not to mention that it is really shady that they are approaching minors with this request. There's a reason kids aren't allowed to enter into legally binding contracts: it's because sometimes adults abuse their power to coerce younger people, and also that inexperienced people aren't always aware of the risks of making a big commitment. You are still in school. This should be your time to have fun and be a kid, not be coerced into being an incubator for your creepy cousin.

That doesn't make sense to me.) \n\nIf I were your parents, I'd be getting a restraining order to keep them away from you.", "NTA. This was beyond inappropriate, and honestly that surrogacy contract is a joke. No actual surrogate would agree to those terms- they were absolutely trying to take advantage of your youth. \n\nMy understanding is that most doctors would never agree to impregnate someone your age who has ever had children as a surrogate anyways- they typically will only work with women who are done having their own kids. \n\nYour cousin is off her rocker.", "Nta. Your cousin is a creep, doesn\u2019t have any boundaries, and she just sounds desperate", "Nta\n \n\nAlso I don't know where you live but in most places you wouldn't even meet requirements to be a surrogate  anyway. \n\nYou need go have at least been pregnant and carried to term once (however they actually prefer that you be done havin your own children before accepting you as a surrogate, and there is a good reason for that. secondary infertility  is a real thing,  or if something goes wrong you could end up infertile. It's not a risk they suggest to take so they want you to be done having your own children first.) \n\nAnd as a minor your automatically not even a possibility.  \n\nUnless your cousin is planning some shady way of doing it at home.", "NTA. This is creepy. They shouldn\u2019t be having kids in the first place with this attitude. Asking teens to be their surrogate behind their parents\u2019 back? Tell your parents. I hope there isn\u2019t anyone younger left that they can try to manipulate.\n\nNo wonder that cousin changed her mind. They probably scared her away. Also I see a divorce in the future if they\u2019re really blaming each other for something that can\u2019t be helped. I never cared about having children, and I have a huge fear of giving birth so I might be lacking empathy, but it sounds better not to bring a child into this marriage, surrogacy or adoption. They don\u2019t sound like pleasant people.\n\nAnd what is this with the \u201ccontinue the bloodline\u201d bs?

Its like they didnt even think it through", "It\u2019s not unless that person already has children of their own. So no legit fertility clinic would ever allow this. Heck a 30 year old without children can\u2019t be a surrogate. So, assuming this is true, either the couple is going to a scam facility, they plan on doing the turkey baster option or husband just found a way to sleep with underaged girls. \n\nI am curious though, if it\u2019s husbands sperm being the issue why do they need a surrogate and not as sperm donor.", "Agencies have a minimum of 21 and generally want you to have had a child.

So sperm and egg are introduced in vitro, where it's easier to manipulate them to actually meet.  \n\nWhy the resulting zygote(s) would not be carried by the actual ovum provider, I have no idea.", "U doubt they were planning on using a clinic.  Move in with them and home birth sounds like they will keep the girl hidden until they kick her to the curb after the birth.  The scary part is how do they plan on getting the girl pregnant.", "NEITHER of them should have kids!", "As it was to be a home birth, I doubt they would use a clinic or that there would be any prenatal care.", "True but it only says the husband is infertile, either way a surrogate wouldn't be the solution as the husbands sperm would still be an issue", "The type of people who would ask minors to carry a child for them are not the kind of people that would consider how that would affect the minor's lives.", "If they are going through proper channels it's not even legal to have someone be a surrogate who hasn't had a successful pregnancy before to increase the chances of a healthy birth.\n\nPelase talk to your parents, it's fucked up they would even consider that", "They don't care about school. They don't care about you. They want what they want and the whole world can go to hell as long as they can get that baby.

Would also explain why they've been going to the doctor for three years already; they've been trying to treat *her* alone not realizing it was a mutual problem.", "So true the rules how the birth will be and that it will be home birth means that they will not have any prenatal or postnatal care.  That the girl has to stay at their home (hidden away).", "They need to call the cops on them.  Next, they will set their sights on a family member that has barely hit puberty (13-14) and guilt them into doing it behind their parent's backs.", "See, I assumed it was because they *finally* badgered the dude into getting tested and *finally* found out that the problem is that they're *both* infertile, not just her. Lots of dudes basically refuse to accept that they could be infertile and refuse to get tested until the doctors have gone through the whole kitchen sink of treatment on their wives, and it would make it make sense that their options were surrogacy or adoption."]}
