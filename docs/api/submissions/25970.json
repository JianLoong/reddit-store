You simply aren't vacation compatible.  There are very few people I will vacay with because we simply don't want to go to the same places and do the same things.  I would be at a complete loss with someone who brought two hair dryers with her.  You two can be good friends but not vacation friends.", "NTA - you're not her caretaker", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYou don't look down on her because of her disability. Nothing abeist that I can find in the post. \n\nShe sounds like a lot of work and I can wholeheartedly understand taking a step back.", "NTA. I don't think you not wanting to travel with her is about her disability but more about you differing travel styles. She seems like a someone who does not plan/think ahead very well. \n\nIf you had a friend with the same health issue who packed properly, knew their physical limits, asked for assistance ahead of time and wasn't rude to people, you would probably be great travel partners.", "NTA.\n\nThis is less about her disability and more so about her not planning ahead and not being properly prepared.", "NTA\nShe needs to stop vacationing and use that money to buy herself a wheelchair", "NTA. Being disabled doesn't mean she can throw tantrums and disparage people to get her way.", "NTA I\u2019m disabled and travel with someone willing to help me(arranged ahead of time) and it\u2019s definitely necessary to inform businesses ahead of time if you need assistance or it won\u2019t be available. Those resources are limited. I do take longer walks to enjoy the environment and I do usually need a taxi home after - this isn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever stop or suggest someone else to not do. Some of us only have so many steps and on vacation I\u2019m enjoying every single one - cabs are NBD. That bit was a little ableist but the rest of it is not(maybe the clothing too but it\u2019s not coming across that she needs multiple outfits due to sensitivity issues rather she just likes options - tho some people with fibro have fabrics they cannot tolerate during a flair). You were not asked to be her caregiver. \n\nThrowing a fit like a toddler at a counter - TBH if I saw that I\u2019d call an ambulance, grown human on the floor bawling and carrying on - MH issue needing professionals imo.", "NTA. It's not ableist to decline further vacations with someone whose company you no.longer enjoy.", "NTA\n\nYou're not being ableist; you're just refusing to be around Ashley's poor behavior on a vacation again.", "NTA, while fibromyalgia is no joke, it appears she did quite a few things to make her own situation worse. Even with those things aside, just her flat out yelling at the employees at the station would have been it for me.", "NTA!  \n\n\nYou just aren't compatible traveling together. You aren't being ableist, you're uncomfortable with the way your friend acts.", "NTA. I was totally ready to say YTA through most of it, but the tantrum at the station changed my mind.", "Nta. As someone who has lupus and something called Ehlers Danlos\u2026I understand what she is going through. Her behavior is NOT ok on any level. She can pack appropriately. I can pack my two girls and myself clothes for a 3-4 day trip in my backpack. (I do it regularly for medical appts.) If one of us is struggling\u2026the rollator comes along. (It\u2019s a walker with a seat and 4 wheels.) It\u2019s not being ableist to want to enjoy a vacation. It\u2019s narcissistic behavior to think you have a right to throw a temper tantrum at her age bc she didn\u2019t plan appropriately and thinks everyone owes her. No one owes her ANYTHING because she\u2019s disabled!!!", "NTA: For those that don't know about this disability it is very easy to assume that your ability will be the same all the time.  It is actually a very fluid scale some days your at 80% others you are at 20.  Others you start at 100% and crash down to 10% out of no where.  It is very hard to plan a vacation around that.  If you pack for being at 10% that can lugging around a bunch of medical aids that you end up not needing.  Then there is judgement of someone seeing a person stand up out of a wheel chair.  The first half of this is some of that inability to plan around a disability, which if that was all that was you would totally be an AH.  The rest is poor needs management and different vacation styles.  The last bit at the train station was unacceptable on her part for treating the people poorly.  Don't vacation with her and call it a day being clear that it is about poor planing not her disability.", "NTA. Fibromyalgia is a disability? As a person with it, That is news to me.
