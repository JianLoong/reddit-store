If you pack for being at 10% that can lugging around a bunch of medical aids that you end up not needing.  Then there is judgement of someone seeing a person stand up out of a wheel chair.  The first half of this is some of that inability to plan around a disability, which if that was all that was you would totally be an AH.  The rest is poor needs management and different vacation styles.  The last bit at the train station was unacceptable on her part for treating the people poorly.

Does it cause pain yes does it require forethought and special medicine yes does it require sitting on a floor and behaving like a spoiled toddler no..\nI'd never vacation with her either", "Agreed,  I have MS. I know I can only walk so much each day,  so I plan my life around what I can do. When I overdo it, it's my fault. I don't abuse others because I didn't budget my limitations properly.", "Yelling at staff because she failed to make advance arrangements during the peak of the tourist season makes her a poor traveling companion for anybody.", "I also have fibromyalgia, and although it can be debilitating at times, I have never heard of it being classed as a disability.

Change \"refusing to vacation with my disabled friend\" to \"refusing to vacation with my friend because I just realized she's a jerk.\"", "NTA. I also have a friend similar to Ashley. She stresses about every little detail, overexplains everything, etc. The worst is when she sometimes disregards her own physical and mental limits so she can do certain things, and then wonders why she has a mini health crisis when she does them. Forget a vacation, she's stressful to be around for even a few hours. So, I know where you're coming from.", "NTA, also I\u2019m pretty sure fibromyalgia is about as much of a disability as like asthma or diabetes or RA.

There is a tiny bit of AH for you, but not enough to change my vote, and that is your comment about the taxi. When you have a variable disability like fibromyalgia it can be very hard to predict how far you can comfortably walk since it can change so much day to day. \u201cI will walk as far as I feel up to and get a taxi home\u201d is one of a number of perfectly acceptable techniques to handle this issue. She should have given you a heads up about it in advance so you knew what to expect, but if she\u2019s paying for her own taxi then that shouldn\u2019t be a massive issue unless she\u2019s refusing to let you also get in the taxi and leaving you by yourself somewhere unsafe. I have autoimmune arthritis and \u2018I\u2019ll just call an Uber\u2019 is absolutely a thing I\u2019ve kept in mind as one option.

I have fibromyalgia. It has 200 different symptoms. Everyone who suffers from it can have different symptoms and reactions. You know what isn't a symptom? Being an ass on a vacation. A lot of people aren't completely disabled from it. Unfortunately for me I have a bad back that cannot be corrected, I have been to so many doctors trying. And osteoarthritis. I'm a huge medical mess. I am in constant pain and nothing takes away my pain. But I get up every day and do my best. I love to travel but know my limits. I have over done it but blame no one but myself. Don't travel with her anymore. It's not worth it.", "NTA, I have fibromyalgia, so I understand about getting overwhelmed from sensory overload. I always carry headphones and I never take out my pain on anyone. I always stop walking before I hit my limit because I do worry about being able to get back. I just had my knees replaced so I get tired very quickly. I would have lost my temper at her and I would never go on vacation with her again. Actually, our friendship would be over if she didn\u2019t acknowledge and apologize for her actions.", "That's not how fibromyalgia works", "NTA\n\nI'm disabled and it can be challenging to do things on trips which can make things annoying for able bodied friends, BUT I go out of my way to plan for these issues by doing things like renting mobility scooters and making sure to let everyone know if they want to do something that I can't that I'm all for them having fun and to take pictures...\n\nShe sounds like she doesn't plan around her issues at all...\n\nBeing disabled myself, I wouldn't want to travel with her either...And I'm likely in worse shape than she is...lol", "NTA.

I don\u2019t have the energy for that level of drama.", "If someone only needs a wheelchair occasionally doctors usually advise doing without as much as possible because it is better to be using your legs than sitting.\n\nHOWEVER in many places these days there are rental companies that rent mobility scooters and wheelchairs to people for a day or a few days, plus facilities like train stations often have things as long as you plan in advance. Her failure is not planning in advance.", "Yeah true. I get the overpacking for clothes as a woman myself, doesn\u2019t sound like an extra hair dryer etc is a medical need.. Nta op her behaviour would have annoyed me too.", "The diagnosis doesn\u2019t define the disability, the degree to which it interferes with your life does. So you could have two people with the same diagnosis and severity (just pretend) and one is in a situation where they have lots of support and resources to help, and the other one has none of that. The one with a lot is likely to experience their condition as far less disabling than the one with very little, because so much of the stuff that helps them is just kind of baked in to their life or otherwise not a big deal.\n\nLike having eyesight bad enough to need glasses is technically a disability and the glasses are an assistive device, but people rarely feel like they are disabled just for having glasses because they are so common to get and use in many places. (However if someone were to try to ban wearing glasses for some random reason, that may well count as discriminatory under whatever laws there are protecting people with disabilities in whatever place.)", "A lot of stuff can be a disability. A disability is basically something that affects your quality of life...aka ability to drive, live alone, and hold down a job.\n\nAnyway...yeah OP NTA.\nFriend didn't do anything to lesson her own pain or make the vacation enjoyable which is all on her.

Heads up though, there are certain things that RA and fibromylegia share, one of which is how sudden flares can occur. I can be walking fine one minute and then the next my feet feel like I'm attempting to walk on very  hot, very jagged rocks. So while this girl's behavior is atrocious, I don't doubt the flares can start that quickly.", "All of those things are disabilities. Some of them can be managed with medication that negates the disabling factors of the illness. But people with untreated asthma and diabetes can die and people with untreated fibromyalgia and RA endure more pain than you could imagine. What are you on about?\n\nClearly this person's behavior is the problem and OP is NTA. But stop with the minimizing serious medical conditions.", "Yep. I have autoimmune arthritis. My SO and kiddo know occasionally I might find a place to go and sit for a bit while they do whatever. It\u2019s no huge deal.", "Yeah I don\u2019t care who claims disability or not.

Is it possible to plan a trip with her that is much less physically demanding?", "NAH.  She doesn't know how to plan ahead. You're not obligated to use your limited vacation time and money to go with her if you don't want to.  But you could help her to fix this stuff.  You clearly understand the problems and she hasn't figured it out. That doesn't make her a bad person she just needs to figure out a lot of things like planning ahead.  If this friendship is valuable to you you could help her prepare for her next trip and set boundaries that you don't want to spend the whole trip dealing with things that you knew about in advance.  I don't think it's unreasonable for her to hope you'll do that and it probably hurts to hear that you don't want to.  That doesn't mean ESH... it just means you guys both have valid feelings and I hope you can figure something out that works for both of you", "NTA Being a drama queen isn\u2019t a disability.", "Yeah your fine.

People with disability's aren't \"different\" human beings. They are just people, who happen to have a disability! So they should be decent and polite ESPECIALLY if it's their fault something isn't right. Only in extreme circumstances where the encounter is NOT their fault and the people behaving towards them are being rude and making their life difficult because of ignorance and discrimination, would I ever condone that sort of behaviour. \n\nI actually (only once) years ago stepped in and had my say in a situation. A woman with a guide dog was being refused entry into a cafe because of her dog. I stepped in and told them in NO uncertain terms that she was allowed in legally and they had NO right to not let her in with her dog. I might have been a bit rude? But they deserved it.", "My mother has several similar physical disabilities like your friend. And also like your friend, she refused to plan trips with her limitations in mind, and lashes out when she inevitably melts down and can't go on and also can't use mobility aids because she refused to accept them earlier. \n\nI had to tell my mother a few years ago that I couldn't travel with her anymore because of this. And when she visits me, I just ignore her ideas and plan everything accessible and as if by magic, it all somehow works out lol. \n\nMy advice is to hold to your boundaries. It's ridiculous, childish behavior that has nothing to do with ableism. But my mother and your friend aren't likely to change, so just focus on protecting your piece.", "Say im not an ableist. I am not able to spend more time around your disguating behaviour.\n\nNta.", "NTA, but as someone with a chronic illness and chronic pain, I would hope my friend would talk to me about the specific issues before telling me they won\u2019t go on vacation with me. I know it was difficult because she asked, but there are ways to get around a direct answer.\n\nFor now, please send her a letter or email that lets her know how much you value her friendship and that what you said is not because of her disability. It will be hard to separate the way she copes from her disability, so tread safely and perhaps ask another person with a disability to review first. \n\nThings to consider when writing so you can get out of an abled head:\n\n\nShe should pack lighter, but is it possible she was packing some comfort items? \n\nWith walks, she should have talked through with you the potential of walking to her limit and taxing home, but sometimes we don\u2019t know our limit until it hits us like a truck.  \n\nHer yelling is inexcusable, but it may be understandable. If she doesn\u2019t normally act like that, then is it possible her body was pushed well past her limit and the pain combined with anxiety to cause a melt down?  Can you help your friend figure out how to cope with things like this in the future?", "NTA.  you have the right to not be burden by her.", "NTA. You clearly don't have an issue with her disability, so you aren't ableist. You have an issue with her not being able to take care of herself or be aware of her limitations. Even if she was fully abled and did that, it would be completely exhausting. Her disability has nothing to do with it.", "NTA. You are her friend, not her caretaker. You can only do so much. Taking care of an ambulent person can be a stressful task and it isn't for everyone.", "Info:  How long has she had it?  Has she had it long enough to know her limitations?  It\u2019s a tricky disorder. A very frustrating disorder.  But you get used to knowing your limitations and what helps over time.  And is she actively trying to come up with pain relieving methods?  Things like using a lacrosse ball as a self-massager can work wonders on trigger points. A TENS unit for $40 can relieve pain in areas really well.  And a wonderful Chinese analgesic called Zheng Gu Shui you can get off Amazon can give hours of pain relief. Trigger point massage is great.  And there are, of course, medications. But the best thing I found was dealing with underlying trauma. There is a mind-body connection to it they don\u2019t understand it at all, but I had EMDR to deal PTSD and honestly almost 10 years after I could barely lift a frying pan, I rarely have to deal with much that can\u2019t be handled with the occasional lacrosse ball massage.  Just speaking from personal experience being proactive can help you deal with it and not ruin experiences for other people. I get her pain, but not her reactions.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting a repeat.

I suffer fibromyalgia myself and some days are better than others. Your aware of her medical issues so having to take a cab home because she couldnt walk futher a little ableist. I truthfully wouldnt want to be next to anyone making a scene. That alone should have been the cause behind no more vacations.", "NTA. I am disabled and when I travel, I take this into account. I make arrangements for disabled/handicapped assistance *in advance* for services like planes/trains/busses/transport. And if something goes a little sideways (like all wheelchairs are being used, so there is a wait for one) I never *never* take it out on the staff. Rudeness and discourtesy is not acceptable behavior.  If I know I\u2019m going to be in a place with a lot of walking, I plan ahead to take breaks and talk with my companions about reasonable limitations. And if they want to do something I can\u2019t do, I check out a coffee shop or bookstore while they do their thing. I don\u2019t make their trip miserable. Frankly, from the sounds of it, I would not want to travel with your friend either.", "NTA!! I have fibro as well but I still manage to not scream at customer service workers then sit on the floor like a child!", "Agree with the NTA decision you\u2019ve made.   Being a \u201cgood traveller\u201d takes experience - I\u2019ve nearly lost my cool a few times traveling with a friend who ticked the first three boxes but knowing what is too much to pack and too much to carry solo, and knowing your limits are things you\u2019ll never really know until you try - and that\u2019s half the fun of becoming a traveler - normally I keep the complaints in my head and forge ahead, and I have definitely started walking in a new city and only realized once I was too far and too tired to trek back that that\u2019s how I was feeling, so I can allow room for that learning curve.

I def always had to overpack because of that so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue but if she can\u2019t manage her bags herself then of course it is an issue.", "Travelling with her would give anyone anxiety, and her disability isn't even on the list of reasons why. Definitely NTA, OP.", "Dude seriously. I have fibromyalgia ( which basically means they can't figure out why I am in constant pain) and I opt our of anything I know I can't handle. I warn everybody well ahead of time what my limitations are and they absolutely are not obligated to help me through any of it. NTA", "Yup. Navigating conflicting access needs. Solution hang out at a table not on a walk :)", "Thank you for offering an option that a good friend should be following. OP going from silence to \u201cI\u2019m never travelling with you again\u201d would be SO hurtful, especially to someone struggling to adapt to disabled life. In my opinion Ashley was also an asshole and her behaviour isn\u2019t excusable, BUT it is easily explained by someone feeling crotchety from pain, overwhelmed by learning the world isn\u2019t accessible & you have to ask/book basic things like a chair not to mention coming to terms with not being able to keep up anymore.\n\nTo me the travel issues would be easily resolved if Ashley learns how to travel as a disabled person but it really seems like she is in early stages of adjusting to disability. I feel like a good friend would be there for her through that and gently nudge her to get help (therapy, support group etc) to adjust to life with her disability. Refusing to travel with her just seems cold. \n\nHope OP takes your advice & Ashley and her are able to travel again when Ashley had come to terms with her disability and all the annoying extra life admin that goes with travelling with a disability.\n\nPersonally never been more grateful to have become disability as a kiddo. These poor adults have such an steep climb to navigate joining the disability club later in life", "Ya but the point is you talked to your mother before putting down that firm boundary.", "\u201cThreats\u201d what is she threatening????", "And a dick to regular staff.", "All of this is true, but as a friend she should be helping her break out of that denial not just refusing to travel with her. I feel like MANY steps were skipped over here. If it\u2019s an acquaintance ya not your circus not your monkeys, but it doesn\u2019t seem like OP did any checking in to ask if support was needed, or even empathetically asking her friend how she is doing adjusting to fibro life. Personally I\u2019ve been disabled since I was a kid so it was easier & I was raised knowing/accepting all the extra steps I need to take to just exist. Fibro isn\u2019t usually diagnosed in kids so the friend is probably struggling to adapt. As a friend OP should be trying to help her not just isolating her by refusing to travel together.", "There are multiple locations around the US that treat EDS and do amazing jobs with it. Kansas City Children\u2019s hospital has a wonderful holistic EDS program as does Tulane Medical Center (for adults).", "And how the world is designed to accommodate/exclude you based on your bodies different abilities. Eg: most ppl can use stairs therefore stairs not ramps are the default design choice.", "It\u2019s interesting that you go off on how bad it is that I am \u201cexcusing\u201d behavior that I wrote is \u201cinexcusable\u201d. \n\nI said it may be understandable which does not mean that it was excusable or that she should be forgiven or given permission to act like this again. I also wrote that OP may be able to help her friend figure out how to cope in the future which is actually having the friend do introspection and work on herself but giving some assistance to get it going. \n\nI also didn\u2019t address the friend calling OP ableist because I believe a conversation about what and why the meltdown happened should have occurred before that.\n\nOne thing about friendship is supporting friends as they try to become better people. If I had a meltdown like that in public around either of my two longest friends, they would know something was wrong with me because I don\u2019t normally act like that. They would be horrified and embarrassed, but also worried. They would follow up after to try and find out if I am experiencing a mental health crisis or if something else is wrong. If they couldn\u2019t deal with me because it was so bad, that would reach out to someone in my family. \n\nIt\u2019s different if she has always acted like this. But the behavior at the station sounds like something OP hasn\u2019t seen before.", "Having been disabled since I was a kid\u2026 do you want a gold star for this? I\u2019d encourage you to read Eli Clare writing, just because we CAN climb the mountain doesn\u2019t mean we have to. \n\nBeing disabled doesn\u2019t give us the right be assholes, but pretending life isn\u2019t harder doesn\u2019t make life easier, it just makes it easier for people to make access barriers our personal problem not a community challenge that can be easily resolved/avoided with universal design of infrastructure/policies. \n\nThere are bathrooms in airports because people flying need to pee, it is possible to estimate how many people might need a wheelchair and maintain a decent number on hand, but airlines are allowed (legally & culturally) to not do so and make it something the disabled person needs to be responsible for.\n\nDisabled people all learn to do that extra work with a smile on our face, but it is a skill we tend to learn, I don\u2019t think Ashley is there yet and a good friend would call her out on that but also support her emotionally as she adjusts to disabled life. \n\n\nMind you flying + wheelchairs is always a nightmare anyway\u2026 we can\u2019t even get them not to accidentally lose or destroy our chairs so we have bigger ableism fish to fry with airlines and Ashley\u2019s tirade doesn\u2019t exactly help her community lol", "See my pain and fatigue path is different, and I have in the past been \"that friend\"...\n\nBecause I was a teenager. And had my spine broken in a traumatic and terifying way, as opposed to subtle symptoms and long and troubling battle to get diagnosed and finally get helped to learn and accept my own limitations. I'd leave my walker or cane at home because \"I'm better now, mom! YOU wear a sweater!\"... for like, the first 3 months after I was finally able to walk a staircase safely and leave the home without assistance. The results involved predictable cab rides home or crying alone in a bar's bathroom and so I quickly got on board and learned, almost unconsciously, to adjust myself and my activities.\n\nok, maybe 5 months of bitching to family (6 for my mom, who was my rock, and remains one of my closest friends), if I'm being fair to the emotional labour even my siblings did back then? But society itself got no more than 90 days or so of pouting before I learned to buck-up, or stay in, or at least have emergency meds and a plan for a meltdown or pain flare-up. Because otherwise you only end up hurting yourself, your own self-worth, and your progress. \n\nThank you for stating that, this thread had been restorative to read over 15 years later, on a low energy day.", "Eh, the girl sounds so immature that she would probably accuse OP of infantilising her if she did that.", "Yep. Disability is not super straightforward in how people experience it or in how society recognizes it.", "Ya, but you probably learned that over time, and being bitchy is a sign of ketones and lows right? Ashley was an asshole, but OP not having the \u201chey our trip kinda sucked, if we go again can you work on figuring out what support you need in advance, happy to help but if you aren\u2019t willing to plan for what you need I don\u2019t think I can go with you\u201d instead of \u201cI\u2019m never travelling with you again!\u201d Is what a good friend would do,", "totally unrelated, because I love your point and quite like your comment overall. It displays maturity and self-awareness without self-deprication and I needed to read something like that today.\n\nBut I have never been able to really \"get\" or at least get behind, the spoons metaphor myself. Learned to walk again at 19 after a car accident, likely TBI, have a psychosis based not-trendy, not cute heavily medication dependant M.E, I've gotten the T-shirt figuratively speaking.\n\nBut who would ever carry more than one, maybe 5 spoons max in a real world situation? A battery, I can relate to. Food on a plate not being infinite? sure it's a concept I can buy. Putting a mask on yourself before trying to even help someone else like in an oxygen deprived flight situation or emotionally draining caregiving or psudo-codependency health situation (like in the post)? Yes, sure. But I have trouble explaining as a health care professional the spoons concept to others because I feel I don't quite understand it.\n\nI just picture myself with a bag or pocket full of useless and heavy ultimately-disposable spoons weighing me down and getting all mixed up and contaminating one another, even on a good day. In lieu of thinking about washing, maintaining, and not filling any utensil with more than I can chew, or the more realistic and much better idea of just having one possibly two dedicated litteral spoons. I'm not a housewife, I don't live my life close enough to my silverware drawer to relate. Spoons are for eating, and don't come in multiples, packs like crayons or nails, when being used day to day, so what am I missing to really get it? (I know it's isn't meant to be litteral. and I have seen an understanding of the concept do wonders for chronic condition sufferers and their caregivers or support people, just kn terms of clear communication alone.)\n\nIf it's not too much trouble or patronizing of me to ask, can you explain the spoon method for me as though I've never heard it before?  I really do want to \"get it\" as it does seem universal and understandable for laymen, professionals, and the person learning to cope with chronic changes themselves. I'd like to use it mkre in my practice, but my clients are even older than me, and the meaning still alludes me, so I worry my teaching is hollow.\n\nPlease, feel no obligation to explain\n\nTLDR: I don't think I have enough cognitive spoons to understand the spoon concept, today especially but most days, it alludes me. Would anyone be willing to try to explain it earnestly?", "He is on a different medication, but we will have to read up on that!

It was more of an \u201cin the moment\u201d explanation that then kind of took off and became its own thing. While I am glad it is helpful to others, I am totally with you in that the spoon theory does not click for me, personally. I tend to use faulty battery or money budgeting as my analogies when I try to explain pacing/energy management to others.\n\n[https://cdn.totalcomputersusa.com/butyoudontlooksick.com/uploads/2010/02/BYDLS-TheSpoonTheory.pdf](https://cdn.totalcomputersusa.com/butyoudontlooksick.com/uploads/2010/02/BYDLS-TheSpoonTheory.pdf)", "I think of it as a bank account.
