If you pack for being at 10% that can lugging around a bunch of medical aids that you end up not needing.  Then there is judgement of someone seeing a person stand up out of a wheel chair.  The first half of this is some of that inability to plan around a disability, which if that was all that was you would totally be an AH.

I know I can only walk so much each day,  so I plan my life around what I can do. When I overdo it, it's my fault.

She stresses about every little detail, overexplains everything, etc. The worst is when she sometimes disregards her own physical and mental limits so she can do certain things, and then wonders why she has a mini health crisis when she does them. Forget a vacation, she's stressful to be around for even a few hours. So, I know where you're coming from.", "NTA, also I\u2019m pretty sure fibromyalgia is about as much of a disability as like asthma or diabetes or RA.

There is a tiny bit of AH for you, but not enough to change my vote, and that is your comment about the taxi. When you have a variable disability like fibromyalgia it can be very hard to predict how far you can comfortably walk since it can change so much day to day. \u201cI will walk as far as I feel up to and get a taxi home\u201d is one of a number of perfectly acceptable techniques to handle this issue. She should have given you a heads up about it in advance so you knew what to expect, but if she\u2019s paying for her own taxi then that shouldn\u2019t be a massive issue unless she\u2019s refusing to let you also get in the taxi and leaving you by yourself somewhere unsafe. I have autoimmune arthritis and \u2018I\u2019ll just call an Uber\u2019 is absolutely a thing I\u2019ve kept in mind as one option.

I have fibromyalgia. It has 200 different symptoms. Everyone who suffers from it can have different symptoms and reactions. You know what isn't a symptom? Being an ass on a vacation. A lot of people aren't completely disabled from it. Unfortunately for me I have a bad back that cannot be corrected, I have been to so many doctors trying. And osteoarthritis. I'm a huge medical mess. I am in constant pain and nothing takes away my pain. But I get up every day and do my best. I love to travel but know my limits. I have over done it but blame no one but myself. Don't travel with her anymore. It's not worth it.", "NTA, I have fibromyalgia, so I understand about getting overwhelmed from sensory overload. I always carry headphones and I never take out my pain on anyone. I always stop walking before I hit my limit because I do worry about being able to get back. I just had my knees replaced so I get tired very quickly. I would have lost my temper at her and I would never go on vacation with her again.

Her failure is not planning in advance.", "Yeah true. I get the overpacking for clothes as a woman myself, doesn\u2019t sound like an extra hair dryer etc is a medical need.. Nta op her behaviour would have annoyed me too.", "The diagnosis doesn\u2019t define the disability, the degree to which it interferes with your life does. So you could have two people with the same diagnosis and severity (just pretend) and one is in a situation where they have lots of support and resources to help, and the other one has none of that. The one with a lot is likely to experience their condition as far less disabling than the one with very little, because so much of the stuff that helps them is just kind of baked in to their life or otherwise not a big deal.\n\nLike having eyesight bad enough to need glasses is technically a disability and the glasses are an assistive device, but people rarely feel like they are disabled just for having glasses because they are so common to get and use in many places. (However if someone were to try to ban wearing glasses for some random reason, that may well count as discriminatory under whatever laws there are protecting people with disabilities in whatever place.)", "A lot of stuff can be a disability. A disability is basically something that affects your quality of life...aka ability to drive, live alone, and hold down a job.\n\nAnyway...yeah OP NTA.\nFriend didn't do anything to lesson her own pain or make the vacation enjoyable which is all on her.

Heads up though, there are certain things that RA and fibromylegia share, one of which is how sudden flares can occur. I can be walking fine one minute and then the next my feet feel like I'm attempting to walk on very  hot, very jagged rocks. So while this girl's behavior is atrocious, I don't doubt the flares can start that quickly.", "All of those things are disabilities. Some of them can be managed with medication that negates the disabling factors of the illness. But people with untreated asthma and diabetes can die and people with untreated fibromyalgia and RA endure more pain than you could imagine. What are you on about?\n\nClearly this person's behavior is the problem and OP is NTA. But stop with the minimizing serious medical conditions.", "Yep. I have autoimmune arthritis. My SO and kiddo know occasionally I might find a place to go and sit for a bit while they do whatever. It\u2019s no huge deal.", "Yeah I don\u2019t care who claims disability or not.

You're not obligated to use your limited vacation time and money to go with her if you don't want to.  But you could help her to fix this stuff.  You clearly understand the problems and she hasn't figured it out. That doesn't make her a bad person she just needs to figure out a lot of things like planning ahead.  If this friendship is valuable to you you could help her prepare for her next trip and set boundaries that you don't want to spend the whole trip dealing with things that you knew about in advance.  I don't think it's unreasonable for her to hope you'll do that and it probably hurts to hear that you don't want to.  That doesn't mean ESH... it just means you guys both have valid feelings and I hope you can figure something out that works for both of you", "NTA Being a drama queen isn\u2019t a disability.", "Yeah your fine.

People with disability's aren't \"different\" human beings. They are just people, who happen to have a disability! So they should be decent and polite ESPECIALLY if it's their fault something isn't right. Only in extreme circumstances where the encounter is NOT their fault and the people behaving towards them are being rude and making their life difficult because of ignorance and discrimination, would I ever condone that sort of behaviour. \n\nI actually (only once) years ago stepped in and had my say in a situation. A woman with a guide dog was being refused entry into a cafe because of her dog. I stepped in and told them in NO uncertain terms that she was allowed in legally and they had NO right to not let her in with her dog. I might have been a bit rude? But they deserved it.", "My mother has several similar physical disabilities like your friend.

And when she visits me, I just ignore her ideas and plan everything accessible and as if by magic, it all somehow works out lol. \n\nMy advice is to hold to your boundaries. It's ridiculous, childish behavior that has nothing to do with ableism. But my mother and your friend aren't likely to change, so just focus on protecting your piece.", "Say im not an ableist.

I know it was difficult because she asked, but there are ways to get around a direct answer.\n\nFor now, please send her a letter or email that lets her know how much you value her friendship and that what you said is not because of her disability. It will be hard to separate the way she copes from her disability, so tread safely and perhaps ask another person with a disability to review first. \n\nThings to consider when writing so you can get out of an abled head:\n\n\nShe should pack lighter, but is it possible she was packing some comfort items? \n\nWith walks, she should have talked through with you the potential of walking to her limit and taxing home, but sometimes we don\u2019t know our limit until it hits us like a truck.  \n\nHer yelling is inexcusable, but it may be understandable. If she doesn\u2019t normally act like that, then is it possible her body was pushed well past her limit and the pain combined with anxiety to cause a melt down?  Can you help your friend figure out how to cope with things like this in the future?", "NTA.  you have the right to not be burden by her.", "NTA. You clearly don't have an issue with her disability, so you aren't ableist. You have an issue with her not being able to take care of herself or be aware of her limitations. Even if she was fully abled and did that, it would be completely exhausting. Her disability has nothing to do with it.", "NTA. You are her friend, not her caretaker. You can only do so much. Taking care of an ambulent person can be a stressful task and it isn't for everyone.", "Info:  How long has she had it?  Has she had it long enough to know her limitations?  It\u2019s a tricky disorder. A very frustrating disorder.  But you get used to knowing your limitations and what helps over time.  And is she actively trying to come up with pain relieving methods?  Things like using a lacrosse ball as a self-massager can work wonders on trigger points. A TENS unit for $40 can relieve pain in areas really well.  And a wonderful Chinese analgesic called Zheng Gu Shui you can get off Amazon can give hours of pain relief. Trigger point massage is great.  And there are, of course, medications. But the best thing I found was dealing with underlying trauma. There is a mind-body connection to it they don\u2019t understand it at all, but I had EMDR to deal PTSD and honestly almost 10 years after I could barely lift a frying pan, I rarely have to deal with much that can\u2019t be handled with the occasional lacrosse ball massage.  Just speaking from personal experience being proactive can help you deal with it and not ruin experiences for other people. I get her pain, but not her reactions.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting a repeat.

I truthfully wouldnt want to be next to anyone making a scene. That alone should have been the cause behind no more vacations.", "NTA. I am disabled and when I travel, I take this into account. I make arrangements for disabled/handicapped assistance *in advance* for services like planes/trains/busses/transport. And if something goes a little sideways (like all wheelchairs are being used, so there is a wait for one) I never *never* take it out on the staff. Rudeness and discourtesy is not acceptable behavior.  If I know I\u2019m going to be in a place with a lot of walking, I plan ahead to take breaks and talk with my companions about reasonable limitations. And if they want to do something I can\u2019t do, I check out a coffee shop or bookstore while they do their thing. I don\u2019t make their trip miserable. Frankly, from the sounds of it, I would not want to travel with your friend either.", "NTA!! I have fibro as well but I still manage to not scream at customer service workers then sit on the floor like a child!", "Agree with the NTA decision you\u2019ve made.   Being a \u201cgood traveller\u201d takes experience - I\u2019ve nearly lost my cool a few times traveling with a friend who ticked the first three boxes but knowing what is too much to pack and too much to carry solo, and knowing your limits are things you\u2019ll never really know until you try - and that\u2019s half the fun of becoming a traveler - normally I keep the complaints in my head and forge ahead, and I have definitely started walking in a new city and only realized once I was too far and too tired to trek back that that\u2019s how I was feeling, so I can allow room for that learning curve. My friend now is literally the only person I\u2019d travel with but I think it\u2019s because she had a great attitude (even when she didn\u2019t) and we laugh about it now lol  It\u2019s the berating staff that makes OPs friend an automatic \u201cdo not travel with\u201d friend - there\u2019s no excuse to pull hissyfits and the like. To me, if you\u2019d pull that  in a different city, then there\u2019s a chance you\u2019d pull that in a foreign country and I don\u2019t eff around in foreign countries. I understand traveling is stressful but if you\u2019re stressed, it\u2019s nobodies problem but your own.", "Yeah, my sister has RA.  She travels with a rolly backpack and that\u2019s it.", "I have fibromyalgia, along with *multiple* other things. I feel bad for OP, because her friend really self sabotaged this trip. Is she *brand new* at being a fibro patient? Because she should know she can't do all that walking, and all that overpacking, and *none* of that carrying, guuurl, carrying should be a NO. Gotta get the rolly suitcases with the 360 wheels. And the long handle. And put your purse on top, wrapped up all tight and secure so no one can steal it.\n\n\n\nBut damn, that sounds like someone who does not know how to assess her own physical capabilities and boundaries. Poor summer child wants to *do it again,* oooh no, baby, nooo.\n\n\nNTA.", "Fibromyalgia can be a disability, but isn't for every patient.  Same with asthma, or RA. It comes down to the severity of that patient's individual case, and how much it impacts their lives. And that is true of any potentially disabling condition.", "Go kick rocks", "Hell i have fibro and most of those things OP is complaining about aren't even related to common symptoms. The walking maybe. I can't imagine not booking assistance and then having a meltdown because of a wait.", "I have a usually very mild healtg issue but it makes travel difficult. I really battle on public transport so usually just walk(or pay for private trantport). But yeah if im travelling with friends ill leave early by myself or foot the bill on yhe transport\nI usually insist if we visi a city that we pay for location of accommodation, and ill foot the difference relative to something on the outskirts", "It should be noted that untreated RA (which is the systemic autoimmune one, not just achy joints) can also die, as it can cause inflammation of the organs, including the heart and lungs.", "I have RA/SLE. I just spent a couple weeks vacationing with friends. A couple weeks because I know I need rest days. The friend I do the most walking stuff with (museums, etc) also has some health issues so we pace each other well. If we know we have to wait an hour, we quietly retire to a cafe or shaded bench. Our need to pace ourselves is ours to deal with, not staff unless absolutely necessary. This person's friend isn't dealing with anything NTA", "Didn\u2019t say it did. Being disabled in no way prevents someone from also being an AH. Everyone can be disabled, not just pleasant well-mannered people.\n\n(I know someone who is disabled who I absolutely will not do stuff with, although I am also disabled, because EVERYTHING is a Drama.  She claims to be an equal rights activist then claims if someone doesn\u2019t read her mind and just KNOW she needs something, they\u2019re being ableist. It\u2019s exhausting and imo sets actual rights movements back because it puts people off and they don\u2019t want to hear what she has to say, even if there are legitimate issues buried in her Drama.) (Lest anyone jump on me for tone policing or whatever, I am talking about behavior where it is completely unreasonable to expect someone to know to do something or know you need something. Not when someone has done something actually ableist, just when someone has not somehow magically Just Known she will need a wheelchair at this point but not at that other time, that sort of thing.)", "NTA  I am in the process of a diagnosis (EDS and/or fibro) and am autistic with adhd and I'm honestly second hand embarrassed for Ashley.  And I'd probably never ask you again out of embarrassment. \n\nI mean, I had a meltdown a few weeks ago, at home, but my husband was on a zoom meeting in another room and his mic picked it up, and I feel like I can never face those colleagues again. (They are all support workers for disability so it's FINE but they have never actually seen/heard me struggle, so I'm just horribly embarrassed even though I didn't do it on purpose.)", "NTA - As someone with myalgic encephalomyelitis, I always make sure I don't overdo it when travelling. I'm not sure if your friend is new to being disabled, but she definitely didn't take her own needs into account and ended up ruining your trip. \n\nI understand her becoming frustrated and upset, but screaming at staff isn't acceptable, and I too wouldn't want to go on a trip with her again. \n\nMe and my best friend both aren't abled people, but we make sure to plan our trips in advance with breaks in-between sightseeing to make sure we don't become overwhelmed and upset.", "NTA, I have celiac, RA, POTS, EDS and many other disabilities. I always plan ahead and book accommodations and I don\u2019t snap at people. she sounds horrid", "NTA it sounds like you don\u2019t want to go on vacation with your friend because they are an asshole, not because they are disabled?", "I\u2019m also disabled (not in the same way) fuck her. \nHaving a disability isn\u2019t an excuse to treat people badly nor does it make you a good person and you don\u2019t owe anyone a relationship of any kind.", "It is not ableist to have boundaries.\nWhatever Ashley\u2019s challenges are, you can not enjoy a vacation with Ashley.\nI have a friend who is in a wheelchair.\nI can\u2019t push her for long due to my own medical issues.\nI don\u2019t go for walks with her because she says she can propel her own chair but after a short time she always asks me to push her.\nIt\u2019s not ableist of me to not do that.\nWe meet places now or visit at her place.\n\nKeep your boundaries. NTA", "NTA. A full on meltdown? Fibromyalgia doesn\u2019t cause one to lose sense of their mental facilities.\n\nIt causes severe pain. Your friend should know that by now and take adequate precautions for herself.\n\nDo yourself a favor and stop going on vacation with her. She obviously can\u2019t be bothered to take care of herself, so why should you have to deal with it?", "NTA you're not comfortable with being around behavior like this again without accountability and willingness to do and be better. You don't owe anyone your time.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard being called ableist or slapped with any \u201chot button\u201d label, but that\u2019s not at all accurate here. If Ashley was without a disability and acted the same way that she did, you wouldn\u2019t want to vacation with her again. The issue isn\u2019t her disability, it\u2019s her behavior. Rather than taking responsibility for her actions, she\u2019s lashing out and hoping to guilt and manipulate you into doing what she wants (much like she did to get a wheelchair). Setting and keeping boundaries in this relationship will serve you well.", "NTA. I have friends and family with fibro and not one of them is an arsehole because of it. That's a separate issue.", "NTA. I have fibromyalgia. Ashley sounds annoying af\u2014nothing to do with her disability, though.", "NTA. I have fibromyalgia and many other disabilities.\n\nSounds like you don't want to spend time with her because of her behavior and her lack of coping mechanisms rather than because of her disability.", "NTA at all, it's your holiday too! It's fine to say no.\nI'm sorry your friend was such a nightmare on your most recent trip. I'm trying not to judge your friend as everyone experiences things differently but I don't think you're being ableist at all. Not many people would be comfortable going on holiday with someone who is whining, rude and has a sit down tantrum on the floor.  I say this as someone married to a person with a severe disability and who works with severely disabled people as a day job. As my partner would say 'having a disability doesn't make you an angel. People with disabilities are can be AH just like everyone else'.", "NTA - OP doesn't want to travel with friend not because she's disabled, but because she's not a compatible travelling partner...but maybe come up with a softer excuse that you turned her down in the heat of the moment but really, you've been under a lot of pressure at work and the timing wasn't great...and can't commit to next year until the staffing shortage is resolved. \n\nMaybe plan a dinner if you still want to maintain the friendship and instead of giving her a hard no, blow off the vacation plan blaming yourself instead.", "Nta.  Packing 7 outfits and several hairdryers has nothing to do with her illness and all to do with her bad planning. \n\nAnd her not booking assistance was a her problem, not anything to do with anyone being ableist. \n\nShe is actually being insulting throwing around words like that.", "Definitely NTA. While it\u2019s not your friend\u2019s fault she has fibromyalgia, the onus is still on her to manage her condition and calling you ableist isn\u2019t cool. I have ME/CFS and always plan ahead, letting friends know what I need to do so we have a plan that suits everyone.", "NTA\n\nYou're not being ableist. \nShe's not being an adult about her own situation and needs. \n\nShe's trying to twist it to sound like you're the one at fault here, when it's her own chosen behaviour and attitude that has caused her to lose a travel buddy.", "You\u2019re NTA, but also Ashley is not managing her fibro properly. Whether she is knowingly doing so, or doesn\u2019t know how to is unknown, but given what you\u2019ve said, it\u2019s a seems like a bit from column A and a bit from column B. \n\nTake it from someone who has a partner who suffers terribly with fibro; dealing with it, even when you know how is constantly an uphill battle. The condition defies logic. You are not being ableist in the slightest.\n\nDoing anything that involves leaving the house requires a check list and prior preparation:\nMedication packed? Does the wheelchair have air in the tires? Has accessibility stuff been sorted out for public transport? Is there enough money in reserve in case we need to get a taxi home? Is there anywhere to stop off between here and where we need to go for a rest? If you do anything that involves a longer trip, how do you split it up to include rest days in between? \n\nAshley needs to come to terms with condition and realise that it\u2019s not up to other people to accommodate it.", "Heck I have fibromyalgia and a broken knee and I can't relate to this at all. Fibromyalgia is already very stigmatized we don't need this kinda crap", "NTA\nYou can be an asshole and disabled and that's exactly what Ashley is. I'm sure there's some mental health issues involved but in your 30's you manage your durability by preparing and planning ahead. Ashley has an awful attitude and threw a tantrum whem she didn't get her own way.   Don't be manipulated into spending time with somebody with such entitlement.", "NTA, also your friend is an asshole more than she is disabled.\n\nI deal with a lot of people who have fibro and they all know their limits and work within them.  If they plan a walk they consider the return journey so they don't have to rely on a lift back.  They take regular breaks and certainly wouldn't pack luggage they couldn't physically carry.  All too often. I find as well is that the young ones (under 40) are often too proud to use walking aids or wheelchairs as they think its embarrassing at their age to be visible disabled/appear to have the mobility of a pensioner.\n\nYour friend is being pretty rude and giving a bad name to fibro sufferers in the process.", "My partner has fibromyalgia as well as a plethora of other chronic illnesses. \n\nWe travelled to the Netherlands with our own personal chair and they did well. \n\nIf she needs a chair she should get one - ours was \u00a3300", "B\nC the he q4rr7rhter$", "I'm disabled and have to do a lot of travel prep. I have to repack my bag several times to make sure I'm able to carry it on my own, I've gotta reserve tickets and shit, have to tell the hotel not to book me in a room that requires stairs, ect. Traveling while disabled is a lot more work and I don't blame people for getting frustrated, especially when they're in pain. However it's not the fault of the workers on the ground that corporations don't care about us. It sucks that cities aren't built with disabled people in mind, but that means we have to be prepared and know our limits. It sucks!!! I'd never blame someone for having a meltdown over it. \n\nBut again, traveling while disabled requires extra panning to make it a good experience. If she won't do that, then traveling with her won't be that much fun, and I don't blame someone for not wanting to spend the money on it. It's why my parents and I have always done so much prep work to make it worthwhile!", "Im a overpacker but then again im capable to carry all the heavy luggage by myself in korea and japan train station stairs with no issue. You just need to know ur limit imo.", "Also you have to budget in financial and energy costs with stuff like fibro and ME. Sometimes I am having a good day, forget to pace and suddenly crash. I can\u2019t walk back. I apologise, offer to pay for a cab for me and the person I\u2019m with or make a plan I get a cab back and nap while they walk back via X place and we compromise on dinner plans for example. Or if I can\u2019t carry my even rolly case because random steps (fuck you TfL) and they keep lifting it for me I shout them coffee, not shout at them.\n\nIt costs me more money to still get to do less but I also warn my travel companions: hey, I am the early bird special, day times are good but I cannot go out clubbing. Are you up for early flea markets or all nighters? Funny enough I get up so early often I have to entertain myself on holiday until people wake up at even 7am. It\u2019s a constant balancing act.\n\nI do not mesh with many people travelling wise. Some are disability related, but it\u2019s mainly compatibility generally. This isn\u2019t like OP insisted on the Spanish Steps knowing Ashley uses walking aids. It was about knowing your limits generally including baggage. And I don\u2019t just mean luggage.\n\nNTA. Ashley would make me \u2018ableist\u2019 toward myself with this hoo ha.", "I have Fibromyalgia, and exactly this.", "Yep! I rolled my eyes when I started reading this because I also have fibromyalgia and then immediately changed my mind. Your friends fibro doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the fact that your friend is budgeting her energy inappropriately, and then proceeding to take it out on others, that\u2019s all happening because she\u2019s an asshole and she\u2019s blaming her illness, which makes her more of an asshole and makes the rest of us look bad.", "Certain things I could *kinda* handwave, such as packing extra garments because with fibro, your temp often fluctuates wildly and so you really don't know if you might need a sweater or a tank top, even when others are not dressed the same.
