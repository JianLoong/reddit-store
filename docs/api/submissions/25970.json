If you pack for being at 10% that can lugging around a bunch of medical aids that you end up not needing.  Then there is judgement of someone seeing a person stand up out of a wheel chair.  The first half of this is some of that inability to plan around a disability, which if that was all that was you would totally be an AH.  The rest is poor needs management and different vacation styles.  The last bit at the train station was unacceptable on her part for treating the people poorly.

Does it cause pain yes does it require forethought and special medicine yes does it require sitting on a floor and behaving like a spoiled toddler no..\nI'd never vacation with her either", "Agreed,  I have MS. I know I can only walk so much each day,  so I plan my life around what I can do. When I overdo it, it's my fault. I don't abuse others because I didn't budget my limitations properly.", "Yelling at staff because she failed to make advance arrangements during the peak of the tourist season makes her a poor traveling companion for anybody.", "I also have fibromyalgia, and although it can be debilitating at times, I have never heard of it being classed as a disability.

Change \"refusing to vacation with my disabled friend\" to \"refusing to vacation with my friend because I just realized she's a jerk.\"", "NTA. I also have a friend similar to Ashley. She stresses about every little detail, overexplains everything, etc. The worst is when she sometimes disregards her own physical and mental limits so she can do certain things, and then wonders why she has a mini health crisis when she does them. Forget a vacation, she's stressful to be around for even a few hours. So, I know where you're coming from.", "NTA, also I\u2019m pretty sure fibromyalgia is about as much of a disability as like asthma or diabetes or RA.

There is a tiny bit of AH for you, but not enough to change my vote, and that is your comment about the taxi. When you have a variable disability like fibromyalgia it can be very hard to predict how far you can comfortably walk since it can change so much day to day. \u201cI will walk as far as I feel up to and get a taxi home\u201d is one of a number of perfectly acceptable techniques to handle this issue. She should have given you a heads up about it in advance so you knew what to expect, but if she\u2019s paying for her own taxi then that shouldn\u2019t be a massive issue unless she\u2019s refusing to let you also get in the taxi and leaving you by yourself somewhere unsafe. I have autoimmune arthritis and \u2018I\u2019ll just call an Uber\u2019 is absolutely a thing I\u2019ve kept in mind as one option.

I have fibromyalgia. It has 200 different symptoms. Everyone who suffers from it can have different symptoms and reactions. You know what isn't a symptom? Being an ass on a vacation. A lot of people aren't completely disabled from it. Unfortunately for me I have a bad back that cannot be corrected, I have been to so many doctors trying. And osteoarthritis. I'm a huge medical mess. I am in constant pain and nothing takes away my pain. But I get up every day and do my best. I love to travel but know my limits. I have over done it but blame no one but myself. Don't travel with her anymore. It's not worth it.", "NTA, I have fibromyalgia, so I understand about getting overwhelmed from sensory overload. I always carry headphones and I never take out my pain on anyone. I always stop walking before I hit my limit because I do worry about being able to get back. I just had my knees replaced so I get tired very quickly. I would have lost my temper at her and I would never go on vacation with her again. Actually, our friendship would be over if she didn\u2019t acknowledge and apologize for her actions.", "That's not how fibromyalgia works", "NTA\n\nI'm disabled and it can be challenging to do things on trips which can make things annoying for able bodied friends, BUT I go out of my way to plan for these issues by doing things like renting mobility scooters and making sure to let everyone know if they want to do something that I can't that I'm all for them having fun and to take pictures...\n\nShe sounds like she doesn't plan around her issues at all...\n\nBeing disabled myself, I wouldn't want to travel with her either...And I'm likely in worse shape than she is...lol", "NTA.

I don\u2019t have the energy for that level of drama.", "If someone only needs a wheelchair occasionally doctors usually advise doing without as much as possible because it is better to be using your legs than sitting.\n\nHOWEVER in many places these days there are rental companies that rent mobility scooters and wheelchairs to people for a day or a few days, plus facilities like train stations often have things as long as you plan in advance. Her failure is not planning in advance.", "Yeah true. I get the overpacking for clothes as a woman myself, doesn\u2019t sound like an extra hair dryer etc is a medical need.. Nta op her behaviour would have annoyed me too.", "The diagnosis doesn\u2019t define the disability, the degree to which it interferes with your life does. So you could have two people with the same diagnosis and severity (just pretend) and one is in a situation where they have lots of support and resources to help, and the other one has none of that. The one with a lot is likely to experience their condition as far less disabling than the one with very little, because so much of the stuff that helps them is just kind of baked in to their life or otherwise not a big deal.\n\nLike having eyesight bad enough to need glasses is technically a disability and the glasses are an assistive device, but people rarely feel like they are disabled just for having glasses because they are so common to get and use in many places. (However if someone were to try to ban wearing glasses for some random reason, that may well count as discriminatory under whatever laws there are protecting people with disabilities in whatever place.)", "A lot of stuff can be a disability. A disability is basically something that affects your quality of life...aka ability to drive, live alone, and hold down a job.\n\nAnyway...yeah OP NTA.\nFriend didn't do anything to lesson her own pain or make the vacation enjoyable which is all on her.

Heads up though, there are certain things that RA and fibromylegia share, one of which is how sudden flares can occur. I can be walking fine one minute and then the next my feet feel like I'm attempting to walk on very  hot, very jagged rocks. So while this girl's behavior is atrocious, I don't doubt the flares can start that quickly.", "All of those things are disabilities. Some of them can be managed with medication that negates the disabling factors of the illness. But people with untreated asthma and diabetes can die and people with untreated fibromyalgia and RA endure more pain than you could imagine. What are you on about?\n\nClearly this person's behavior is the problem and OP is NTA. But stop with the minimizing serious medical conditions.", "Yep. I have autoimmune arthritis. My SO and kiddo know occasionally I might find a place to go and sit for a bit while they do whatever. It\u2019s no huge deal.", "Yeah I don\u2019t care who claims disability or not.

Is it possible to plan a trip with her that is much less physically demanding?", "NAH.  She doesn't know how to plan ahead. You're not obligated to use your limited vacation time and money to go with her if you don't want to.  But you could help her to fix this stuff.  You clearly understand the problems and she hasn't figured it out. That doesn't make her a bad person she just needs to figure out a lot of things like planning ahead.  If this friendship is valuable to you you could help her prepare for her next trip and set boundaries that you don't want to spend the whole trip dealing with things that you knew about in advance.  I don't think it's unreasonable for her to hope you'll do that and it probably hurts to hear that you don't want to.  That doesn't mean ESH... it just means you guys both have valid feelings and I hope you can figure something out that works for both of you", "NTA Being a drama queen isn\u2019t a disability.", "Yeah your fine.

People with disability's aren't \"different\" human beings. They are just people, who happen to have a disability! So they should be decent and polite ESPECIALLY if it's their fault something isn't right. Only in extreme circumstances where the encounter is NOT their fault and the people behaving towards them are being rude and making their life difficult because of ignorance and discrimination, would I ever condone that sort of behaviour. \n\nI actually (only once) years ago stepped in and had my say in a situation. A woman with a guide dog was being refused entry into a cafe because of her dog. I stepped in and told them in NO uncertain terms that she was allowed in legally and they had NO right to not let her in with her dog. I might have been a bit rude? But they deserved it.", "My mother has several similar physical disabilities like your friend. And also like your friend, she refused to plan trips with her limitations in mind, and lashes out when she inevitably melts down and can't go on and also can't use mobility aids because she refused to accept them earlier. \n\nI had to tell my mother a few years ago that I couldn't travel with her anymore because of this. And when she visits me, I just ignore her ideas and plan everything accessible and as if by magic, it all somehow works out lol. \n\nMy advice is to hold to your boundaries. It's ridiculous, childish behavior that has nothing to do with ableism. But my mother and your friend aren't likely to change, so just focus on protecting your piece.", "Say im not an ableist. I am not able to spend more time around your disguating behaviour.\n\nNta.", "NTA, but as someone with a chronic illness and chronic pain, I would hope my friend would talk to me about the specific issues before telling me they won\u2019t go on vacation with me. I know it was difficult because she asked, but there are ways to get around a direct answer.\n\nFor now, please send her a letter or email that lets her know how much you value her friendship and that what you said is not because of her disability. It will be hard to separate the way she copes from her disability, so tread safely and perhaps ask another person with a disability to review first. \n\nThings to consider when writing so you can get out of an abled head:\n\n\nShe should pack lighter, but is it possible she was packing some comfort items? \n\nWith walks, she should have talked through with you the potential of walking to her limit and taxing home, but sometimes we don\u2019t know our limit until it hits us like a truck.  \n\nHer yelling is inexcusable, but it may be understandable. If she doesn\u2019t normally act like that, then is it possible her body was pushed well past her limit and the pain combined with anxiety to cause a melt down?  Can you help your friend figure out how to cope with things like this in the future?", "NTA.  you have the right to not be burden by her.", "NTA. You clearly don't have an issue with her disability, so you aren't ableist. You have an issue with her not being able to take care of herself or be aware of her limitations. Even if she was fully abled and did that, it would be completely exhausting. Her disability has nothing to do with it.", "NTA. You are her friend, not her caretaker. You can only do so much. Taking care of an ambulent person can be a stressful task and it isn't for everyone.", "Info:  How long has she had it?  Has she had it long enough to know her limitations?  It\u2019s a tricky disorder. A very frustrating disorder.  But you get used to knowing your limitations and what helps over time.  And is she actively trying to come up with pain relieving methods?  Things like using a lacrosse ball as a self-massager can work wonders on trigger points. A TENS unit for $40 can relieve pain in areas really well.  And a wonderful Chinese analgesic called Zheng Gu Shui you can get off Amazon can give hours of pain relief. Trigger point massage is great.  And there are, of course, medications. But the best thing I found was dealing with underlying trauma. There is a mind-body connection to it they don\u2019t understand it at all, but I had EMDR to deal PTSD and honestly almost 10 years after I could barely lift a frying pan, I rarely have to deal with much that can\u2019t be handled with the occasional lacrosse ball massage.  Just speaking from personal experience being proactive can help you deal with it and not ruin experiences for other people. I get her pain, but not her reactions.  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting a repeat.

I suffer fibromyalgia myself and some days are better than others. Your aware of her medical issues so having to take a cab home because she couldnt walk futher a little ableist. I truthfully wouldnt want to be next to anyone making a scene. That alone should have been the cause behind no more vacations.", "NTA. I am disabled and when I travel, I take this into account. I make arrangements for disabled/handicapped assistance *in advance* for services like planes/trains/busses/transport. And if something goes a little sideways (like all wheelchairs are being used, so there is a wait for one) I never *never* take it out on the staff. Rudeness and discourtesy is not acceptable behavior.  If I know I\u2019m going to be in a place with a lot of walking, I plan ahead to take breaks and talk with my companions about reasonable limitations. And if they want to do something I can\u2019t do, I check out a coffee shop or bookstore while they do their thing. I don\u2019t make their trip miserable. Frankly, from the sounds of it, I would not want to travel with your friend either.", "NTA!! I have fibro as well but I still manage to not scream at customer service workers then sit on the floor like a child!", "Agree with the NTA decision you\u2019ve made.   Being a \u201cgood traveller\u201d takes experience - I\u2019ve nearly lost my cool a few times traveling with a friend who ticked the first three boxes but knowing what is too much to pack and too much to carry solo, and knowing your limits are things you\u2019ll never really know until you try - and that\u2019s half the fun of becoming a traveler - normally I keep the complaints in my head and forge ahead, and I have definitely started walking in a new city and only realized once I was too far and too tired to trek back that that\u2019s how I was feeling, so I can allow room for that learning curve.

Each of my wives has been just like that-- a weekend trip to anywhere requires at least three full suitcases, five or six outfits, twelve pounds of toiletries, eight pairs of shoes, and assorted odds & ends. And then complain about how it all weighs too much. \n\nIf that doesn't get enough attention, throw a hissy fit every half hour. \n\nYou have done the right thing.", "I too have fibromyalgia. \n\nNone of what you're describing is because of her being disabled. It was because of poor planing. \nWe can plan how much we can carry, we can plan a route which won't exshust us. And we absolutely can plan to call ahead to book assistance at a train station. You don't have a problem with her disability, you have a problem with her terrible lack of planning. \n\nNTA.", "She sounds like the entitled lady in a tiktok going off on employees at an airline because they weren't pushing her wheelchair fast enough or where she wanted.\n\nNTA.

You\u2019re not trapped into annual holidays because she is is disabled. You just don\u2019t seem to have compatible styles.

Not a fun person to travel with.", "She\u2019s disabled because of fibromyalgia? Lmao. \n\nNo, her disability is clearly of another sort.", "It\u2019s possible that in addition to having fibromyalgia your friend is also neurodivergent. There is a strong correlation between chronic pain conditions and diagnoses like autism and executive processing issues. The latter would explain her difficulty making decisions, planning in advance, not being realistic about how much she can handle, etc. Would it be possible to talk to her about these specific issues, separate from her fibromyalgia? It\u2019s hard to hurt all the time, and it can be hard to be a friend to someone with a chronic condition. She probably saw the trip as a success. Maybe if you were able to set some guidelines you might be able to do something together in the future? NTA", "Nta. She\u2019s entitled", "Nta. Sounds like you'd end up being her carer in a way", "NTA, someone this selfish and close minded about their own disability is toxic. You don't owe her anything. It's not even just about the vacation, it's about your friendship. I would break contact with someone this toxic, because in the long run, it's better for you.  \nIf she is allowed to be selfish (especially the meltdown at the station), why shouldn't you?", "NTA.  I have CFS and know my limitations.  I am on 12 different vitamins and supplements because finding a doctor to treat this is impossible.   The one I did have years ago, gave up.  I would not put my best friend through that.  You are not \"Ableist.\"  I think she needs to take a step back and realize that she needs to make her own accommodations.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not ableist to not  want to vacation with Ashley due to her disorganization. It seems like in the moment, you were pretty graceful helping deal with her needs as best you could. You didn\u2019t tell her that her disability was bothering you \u2013 you told her she just wasn\u2019t the person you wanted to vacation with. And that\u2019s OK! I went to Palm Springs last December with a friend and I\u2019ll never go on vacation with her again ha ha. Some people just aren\u2019t suited to travel together.", "NTA. I think her actual disability is her personality.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re not responsible for her needs. She\u2019s an adult.\nI have fibromyalgia & arthritis.

Not all friends are travel compatible and that\u2019s ok.

Based on OP's account, aside from an extremely patient partner/caregiver/parent/aide, I don't think Ashely would travel well with *anyone*.", "No this is absolutely ridiculous, I have what can be technically classed as a physical disability and no matter the pain, exhaustion, fear whatever is going on that day I have NEVER used it as an excuse like her trash friend did.

I don\u2019t care what people have \u201cwrong\u201d with them being \u201cdisabled\u201d is not a license to act appallingly and her abled friend doesn\u2019t need to be disabled to call her out on her shit\n\nThis new identity game people play where they have to be the most disadvantaged and disabled and special is gross and you excusing it is just giving people like this the permission to keep doing it. Someone having a hardship is not a magic shield to hide behind when they mistreat people. It\u2019s not defendable, she\u2019s a huge dick and she sounds miserable to be around but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s easier for her to blame someone and call them ableist than do any type of introspection and work on herself. Nasty", "No", "This is a very kind take on your part, but I'm not sure that it's accurate. She doesn't know how to plan ahead could certainly be the case for the over packing and walking so far that she needs a taxi. Some disabilities are variable day to day, so even if she's had fibro for a long time, it can still be surprising, sure. If it was just that, I'd agree NAH. \n\nBut she literally sat on the floor and started screaming and insulting employees. That's...not poor planning. That's a giant temper tantrum. It has nothing to do with her disability. And then when OP tried to politely decline another vacation, Ashley threw another fit and called her ableist. Both of these things are conscious choices within her responsibility, so they move her into AH territory, and OP into NTA.", ">Maybe OP could give her friend something more to work with than \u201cwe\u2019re not a good fit.\u201d You can draw an infinite number of conclusions from that.\n\nAnd those infinite conclusions are her own problem to deal with. OP did not enjoy the vacation, so she won't be joining for the next one. Case closed. If her friend wants to find out *why*, she can ask clarifying questions, and OP can answer them if she wants. \n\n>A lot of people don\u2019t handle rejection very well and lash out as their first reaction.\n\nThat's asshole behavior.

But I'm going to a convention with a friend next month and this is reminding me to be extra mindful so I don't overdo it and end up making the trip unpleasant for anyone.\n\nOP is definitely NTA. If you have fibromyalgia, you learn your limits and try to operate within them, which means don't overpack, try to arrange rest breaks throughout the day, and sort out accommodations as far in advance as possible. If you fail to do those things, it's on you, not your travelling companion. I wouldn't want to holiday with her either; it's not because she's disabled, it's because she's unpleasant and entitled about it.", "As someone with fibro, sorry I\u2019m not super dramatic and obsessed with how awful my body feels.   \nThat\u2019s a bit crappy from a person with fibro to generalise about others with the same condition.
