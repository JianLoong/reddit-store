Nothing abeist that I can find in the post. \n\nShe sounds like a lot of work and I can wholeheartedly understand taking a step back.", "NTA. I don't think you not wanting to travel with her is about her disability but more about you differing travel styles.

Some of us only have so many steps and on vacation I\u2019m enjoying every single one - cabs are NBD. That bit was a little ableist but the rest of it is not(maybe the clothing too but it\u2019s not coming across that she needs multiple outfits due to sensitivity issues rather she just likes options - tho some people with fibro have fabrics they cannot tolerate during a flair). You were not asked to be her caregiver. \n\nThrowing a fit like a toddler at a counter - TBH if I saw that I\u2019d call an ambulance, grown human on the floor bawling and carrying on - MH issue needing professionals imo.", "NTA. It's not ableist to decline further vacations with someone whose company you no.longer enjoy.", "NTA\n\nYou're not being ableist; you're just refusing to be around Ashley's poor behavior on a vacation again.", "NTA, while fibromyalgia is no joke, it appears she did quite a few things to make her own situation worse.

As someone who has lupus and something called Ehlers Danlos\u2026I understand what she is going through. Her behavior is NOT ok on any level. She can pack appropriately. I can pack my two girls and myself clothes for a 3-4 day trip in my backpack. (I do it regularly for medical appts.) If one of us is struggling\u2026the rollator comes along. (It\u2019s a walker with a seat and 4 wheels.) It\u2019s not being ableist to want to enjoy a vacation. It\u2019s narcissistic behavior to think you have a right to throw a temper tantrum at her age bc she didn\u2019t plan appropriately and thinks everyone owes her. No one owes her ANYTHING because she\u2019s disabled!!!", "NTA: For those that don't know about this disability it is very easy to assume that your ability will be the same all the time.  It is actually a very fluid scale some days your at 80% others you are at 20.  Others you start at 100% and crash down to 10% out of no where.  It is very hard to plan a vacation around that.  If you pack for being at 10% that can lugging around a bunch of medical aids that you end up not needing.  Then there is judgement of someone seeing a person stand up out of a wheel chair.  The first half of this is some of that inability to plan around a disability, which if that was all that was you would totally be an AH.  The rest is poor needs management and different vacation styles.  The last bit at the train station was unacceptable on her part for treating the people poorly.  Don't vacation with her and call it a day being clear that it is about poor planing not her disability.", "NTA. Fibromyalgia is a disability? As a person with it, That is news to me.

I know I can only walk so much each day,  so I plan my life around what I can do. When I overdo it, it's my fault. I don't abuse others because I didn't budget my limitations properly.", "Yelling at staff because she failed to make advance arrangements during the peak of the tourist season makes her a poor traveling companion for anybody.", "I also have fibromyalgia, and although it can be debilitating at times, I have never heard of it being classed as a disability.

Change \"refusing to vacation with my disabled friend\" to \"refusing to vacation with my friend because I just realized she's a jerk.\"", "NTA. I also have a friend similar to Ashley. She stresses about every little detail, overexplains everything, etc. The worst is when she sometimes disregards her own physical and mental limits so she can do certain things, and then wonders why she has a mini health crisis when she does them. Forget a vacation, she's stressful to be around for even a few hours. So, I know where you're coming from.", "NTA, also I\u2019m pretty sure fibromyalgia is about as much of a disability as like asthma or diabetes or RA. Like, she has health needs, but shes able to meet her own needs and chooses not to\u2026such as walking in one direction that she can\u2019t walk back like what", "NTA. There is a tiny bit of AH for you, but not enough to change my vote, and that is your comment about the taxi. When you have a variable disability like fibromyalgia it can be very hard to predict how far you can comfortably walk since it can change so much day to day. \u201cI will walk as far as I feel up to and get a taxi home\u201d is one of a number of perfectly acceptable techniques to handle this issue. She should have given you a heads up about it in advance so you knew what to expect, but if she\u2019s paying for her own taxi then that shouldn\u2019t be a massive issue unless she\u2019s refusing to let you also get in the taxi and leaving you by yourself somewhere unsafe. I have autoimmune arthritis and \u2018I\u2019ll just call an Uber\u2019 is absolutely a thing I\u2019ve kept in mind as one option.

I have fibromyalgia. It has 200 different symptoms. Everyone who suffers from it can have different symptoms and reactions. You know what isn't a symptom? Being an ass on a vacation. A lot of people aren't completely disabled from it. Unfortunately for me I have a bad back that cannot be corrected, I have been to so many doctors trying. And osteoarthritis. I'm a huge medical mess. I am in constant pain and nothing takes away my pain. But I get up every day and do my best. I love to travel but know my limits. I have over done it but blame no one but myself. Don't travel with her anymore. It's not worth it.", "NTA, I have fibromyalgia, so I understand about getting overwhelmed from sensory overload. I always carry headphones and I never take out my pain on anyone. I always stop walking before I hit my limit because I do worry about being able to get back. I just had my knees replaced so I get tired very quickly. I would have lost my temper at her and I would never go on vacation with her again. Actually, our friendship would be over if she didn\u2019t acknowledge and apologize for her actions.", "That's not how fibromyalgia works", "NTA\n\nI'm disabled and it can be challenging to do things on trips which can make things annoying for able bodied friends, BUT I go out of my way to plan for these issues by doing things like renting mobility scooters and making sure to let everyone know if they want to do something that I can't that I'm all for them having fun and to take pictures...\n\nShe sounds like she doesn't plan around her issues at all...\n\nBeing disabled myself, I wouldn't want to travel with her either...And I'm likely in worse shape than she is...lol", "NTA.

Sometimes I will go to venues earlier/later/via a different method to my friends to allow myself time to rest etc. If my friends have a massive day planned, I might just attend the first half.\n\nIt sounds like she is in denial about her limitations and expects everyone/the world to cater to her needs.

I don\u2019t have the energy for that level of drama.", "If someone only needs a wheelchair occasionally doctors usually advise doing without as much as possible because it is better to be using your legs than sitting.\n\nHOWEVER in many places these days there are rental companies that rent mobility scooters and wheelchairs to people for a day or a few days, plus facilities like train stations often have things as long as you plan in advance. Her failure is not planning in advance.", "Yeah true. I get the overpacking for clothes as a woman myself, doesn\u2019t sound like an extra hair dryer etc is a medical need.. Nta op her behaviour would have annoyed me too.", "The diagnosis doesn\u2019t define the disability, the degree to which it interferes with your life does. So you could have two people with the same diagnosis and severity (just pretend) and one is in a situation where they have lots of support and resources to help, and the other one has none of that. The one with a lot is likely to experience their condition as far less disabling than the one with very little, because so much of the stuff that helps them is just kind of baked in to their life or otherwise not a big deal.\n\nLike having eyesight bad enough to need glasses is technically a disability and the glasses are an assistive device, but people rarely feel like they are disabled just for having glasses because they are so common to get and use in many places. (However if someone were to try to ban wearing glasses for some random reason, that may well count as discriminatory under whatever laws there are protecting people with disabilities in whatever place.)", "A lot of stuff can be a disability. A disability is basically something that affects your quality of life...aka ability to drive, live alone, and hold down a job.\n\nAnyway...yeah OP NTA.\nFriend didn't do anything to lesson her own pain or make the vacation enjoyable which is all on her.

Heads up though, there are certain things that RA and fibromylegia share, one of which is how sudden flares can occur. I can be walking fine one minute and then the next my feet feel like I'm attempting to walk on very  hot, very jagged rocks. So while this girl's behavior is atrocious, I don't doubt the flares can start that quickly.", "All of those things are disabilities. Some of them can be managed with medication that negates the disabling factors of the illness. But people with untreated asthma and diabetes can die and people with untreated fibromyalgia and RA endure more pain than you could imagine. What are you on about?\n\nClearly this person's behavior is the problem and OP is NTA. But stop with the minimizing serious medical conditions.", "Yep. I have autoimmune arthritis. My SO and kiddo know occasionally I might find a place to go and sit for a bit while they do whatever. It\u2019s no huge deal.", "Yeah I don\u2019t care who claims disability or not. Doesn\u2019t give an excuse to be an asshole throwing a fit.", "It is classed as a disabilty, but there are different levels. However, not all levels qualify for benefits. \n\nI have Fibro (and arthritis), but I also spend 30% of the year with business travel. Since these trios are large conventions, I have started renting mobility scooters. \n\nTravel isn't impossible with Fibro and such, but it can be more difficult.
