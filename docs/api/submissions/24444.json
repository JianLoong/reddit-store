I live with my husband and our family now.  \n\nWhoever is going to have a shower alerts everyone to check no one needs the bathroom first.   If something urgent does happen I'm happy to get out of the shower and let them have the room.    \n\nMaybe its the way I was raised with family members who have medical issues and sometimes MUST get in straight away but I'll wait to see what reddit says in general", "NTA. Even adults have a point where nothing is holding back the poonami.

If you have sudden diarrhea for example, being an adult isn't going to help you hold it.\n\nI too don't like having others use a toilet in front of me. But when you live together, you gotta make allowances.\n\nAnd he's way overreacting about being exposed to \"poop molecules.\" It's more of a risk to ingest them, not inhale them.\n\nThis would honestly be a dealbreaker for me. I couldn't be with someone like him.", "NTA. You had a natural and urgent bodily function that you could not control. You did what you had to do, and your boyfriend should be more concerned about your health and comfort than his own disgust. Poop molecules are already everywhere, by the way. He's probably breathing them in right now.", "NTA.\n\n\"poop molecules\"  LOL.  Your boyfriend has issues.", "INFO: Did you ask him to hurry up?", "The water molecules are creating a layer of protection from the poop molecules.

That doesn\u2019t excuse him getting super angry at you, and trying to patronize you like that.", "Isn\u2019t it common courtesy in such cases the person showering will come out quickly letting the other person in? That\u2019s how it works in our household", "NTA - my only question is, did you poke your head in when the need first hit and tell him you had to go and ask him to hurry up? If so, then def NTA.

I mean 15 minutes is a good amount of time for a man to shower so what else did he need to do in there? He\u2019s TA 10000%", "NTA! You could only hold it for so long before you have to relieve your discomfort. does your bf poop? Because I'm sure if he does there's poop molecules in his immediate surrounding? How does he deal with it? Also, if he's gross out with poop, how does he clean himself afterwards?", "OP was he reading a book or what else was going on to be in the shower for more than 15 min?  That's my only question I would have to ask him.  You can't be expected to go down to the corner coffee shop.  He needs to understand he needs to get over this phobia since they've done numerous studies that the \"poop molecules\" aren't relegated to only when you're doing the action and the toilet will magically whisk everything away and disinfect everything.  Honestly just let him have his moment because until he learns the truth, no matter what you say it'll make no difference.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to say NAH because both of you have a point and it was just a bad situation, but you said he is  \"extremely angry,\" yelled, etc. and that's not cool.\n\nHe's right about those molecules though.", "Does he have a fear of public restrooms and poop molecules?", "I'm just sitting here stunned with all the <15 min showers. Y'all need a shower beer sometime, savour the time to yourself.", "Poop molecules? What is that? Isn\u2019t that why the poop lands in water?", "YTA. My husband will knck and tell me that he has to go, that he's sorry but that I need to hurry up. You could have done that 5 minutes into you holding it. \n\nAlso, I don't believe your story. I don't believe that he was taking 20+ minutes shower.", "NTA. He should have cut his shower short as soon as you asked him. 15 minutes is bullshit selfish behaviour.", "Who showers for 15 minutes? NTA", "Wtf lol you're NTA, your bf sounds ridiculous.", "NTA he needs to grow the hell up", "Nta you are a human not a bot.", "NTA.\n\nJust remind him of this when the situation is vice versa. There will come a day.", "I am pretty sure he has had that problem in the past. Sometime when you got to go you got to go. And no amount leg crossing will help.  Lol. He is overreacting and clearly not thinking start.  Besides it isn\u2019t like this is a common occurrence. Ask him. So you never had to go and couldn\u2019t hold it.", "Poop molecules are in the bathroom already. Pooping or not pooping when he is in the shower doesn\u2019t change anything. \n\nTell him if he is not interested in therapy to treat his phobia of poop molecules, he needs to pay up for a bigger place with a 2nd bathroom.", "Yta", "We have raised two kids in a one bathroom home. Shit happens. It\u2019s not ideal, but it is what it is.", "NTA. It\u2019s a right of passage. Every couple who lives in a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment goes through this. It\u2019s how you deal with it that\u2019s important. The red flag for me is that your bf can\u2019t laugh at this and is being unreasonable. He needs to grow up.", "Your BF needs to mature and learn that bodily functions can't always be controlled or happen on HIS timeline (like if he's enjoying a longer shower).\n\nHopefully you put the toilet seat down so you can safely tell him his fears about poo particles are unfounded.\n\nI also hope he doesn't make a habit of yelling at you and making you out to be a child.

You did what you had to do.", "Nta - but you would be if you flushed the toilet and it made the water cold. \n\nBut seriously, who showers for 15-20 minutes?", "NTA - He sounds like he needs to get over it.  Emergencies happen and he needs to ask like a grown up about it. Does he freak out when you throw away tampons/pads in your bathroom trash too?", "NTA. When you gotta go, you gotta go. He could have stepped out of the shower for a bit while you went. 15 minutes is a long shower anyway. He should have finished up and gotten out.", "You did say he\u2019s 27 right? Sounds more like 12. Don\u2019t get your cooties on him any more!! Also, sorry for your sex life with this grown baby.", "NTA. 15 minute shower is the issue in such a small place.\n\nStayed in a place with 9 people and one bathroom. Rule was you got 5 minutes of privacy and then anyone could call emergency if needed so you better be dressed again or Hello!", "NTA. \n\nIs he mature enough to be in an adult relationship? \n\nIf you pooping in front of him has him this angry, how do you think he\u2019d react to literally wiping your butt if you were in some terrible accident and were incapable of doing it yourself whilst in recovery? \n\nA friend of a friend of mine had a c-section, got home and had to poop a couple days later, she ended up ripping her stitches and her intestines came out. Literally came out. On to her lap and onto the bathroom floor. Her husband (a doctor) had to wipe her butt, hold/catch her intestines and call for an ambulance. He never whinged about anything. \n\nI had to have major surgery four times, the third time, recovery was really brutal. My better half never once complained or made me feel anything other than being his first priority. He certainly never yelled at me. \n\nYes these two examples are medically related, serious times and this was how the men in our lives treated us, with respect and compassion. You needed to poop and he\u2019s going on about it like a soap opera. \n\nThere\u2019s men\u2026then there\u2019s boys pretending to be men.

It is less than when he is sitting on the toilet reading his phone", "NTA. but you might want to consider division of labour when you have babies. All that poop at inconvenient times \u2026.", "Nta. I don't poop in front of my husband. We live in a 2 br 1 bath, we both are lactose intolerant, we try to hold it as long as possible until the other gets out of the bathroom, sometimes will frantically yell and text to get out saying it's code brown, meaning our ass is kissing our undies goodbye. At that point, we need to sit down on the toilet because it's only a matter of time. We know that feeling all too well, but if our asses are puckering and one of us is in the shower, we'll go if we absolutely can't hold it much longer.", "Did you consider telling him 5 minutes in so he could rush his shower? If he wasn't out at the 13 minute mark, walk in and say her out now if you don't want to be here for it, but I gotta' go. \n\nObviously, when you gotta go, you gotta go. \n\nIt sounds like this has come up before, perhaps several times and he's made it clear he has very strong feelings about this.

But he also needs to come to an understanding that while you would not abuse the privilege, if you give him a 15min warning, he needs to respect and abide by it.\n\nHe does not get to control how your body regulates itself, hell you don't even have that control when it comes to continence most times.
