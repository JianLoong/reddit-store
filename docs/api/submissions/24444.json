But when you live together, you gotta make allowances.\n\nAnd he's way overreacting about being exposed to \"poop molecules.\" It's more of a risk to ingest them, not inhale them.\n\nThis would honestly be a dealbreaker for me. I couldn't be with someone like him.", "NTA. You had a natural and urgent bodily function that you could not control. You did what you had to do, and your boyfriend should be more concerned about your health and comfort than his own disgust. Poop molecules are already everywhere, by the way. He's probably breathing them in right now.", "NTA.\n\n\"poop molecules\"  LOL.  Your boyfriend has issues.\n\nETA: Since it's been repeatedly raised, yes, I know that poop molecules are a thing.

You could only hold it for so long before you have to relieve your discomfort. does your bf poop? Because I'm sure if he does there's poop molecules in his immediate surrounding?

That's my only question I would have to ask him.  You can't be expected to go down to the corner coffee shop.  He needs to understand he needs to get over this phobia since they've done numerous studies that the \"poop molecules\" aren't relegated to only when you're doing the action and the toilet will magically whisk everything away and disinfect everything.  Honestly just let him have his moment because until he learns the truth, no matter what you say it'll make no difference.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to say NAH because both of you have a point and it was just a bad situation, but you said he is  \"extremely angry,\" yelled, etc. and that's not cool.\n\nHe's right about those molecules though.", "Does he have a fear of public restrooms and poop molecules?", "I'm just sitting here stunned with all the <15 min showers. Y'all need a shower beer sometime, savour the time to yourself.", "Poop molecules? What is that? Isn\u2019t that why the poop lands in water?", "YTA. My husband will knck and tell me that he has to go, that he's sorry but that I need to hurry up. You could have done that 5 minutes into you holding it. \n\nAlso, I don't believe your story. I don't believe that he was taking 20+ minutes shower.", "NTA. He should have cut his shower short as soon as you asked him. 15 minutes is bullshit selfish behaviour.", "Who showers for 15 minutes? NTA", "Wtf lol you're NTA, your bf sounds ridiculous.", "NTA he needs to grow the hell up", "Nta you are a human not a bot.", "NTA.\n\nJust remind him of this when the situation is vice versa. There will come a day.", "I am pretty sure he has had that problem in the past. Sometime when you got to go you got to go. And no amount leg crossing will help.  Lol. He is overreacting and clearly not thinking start.  Besides it isn\u2019t like this is a common occurrence. Ask him. So you never had to go and couldn\u2019t hold it.", "Poop molecules are in the bathroom already. Pooping or not pooping when he is in the shower doesn\u2019t change anything. \n\nTell him if he is not interested in therapy to treat his phobia of poop molecules, he needs to pay up for a bigger place with a 2nd bathroom.", "Yta", "We have raised two kids in a one bathroom home.

It\u2019s how you deal with it that\u2019s important. The red flag for me is that your bf can\u2019t laugh at this and is being unreasonable. He needs to grow up.", "Your BF needs to mature and learn that bodily functions can't always be controlled or happen on HIS timeline (like if he's enjoying a longer shower).\n\nHopefully you put the toilet seat down so you can safely tell him his fears about poo particles are unfounded.\n\nI also hope he doesn't make a habit of yelling at you and making you out to be a child.

Emergencies happen and he needs to ask like a grown up about it. Does he freak out when you throw away tampons/pads in your bathroom trash too?", "NTA. When you gotta go, you gotta go. He could have stepped out of the shower for a bit while you went. 15 minutes is a long shower anyway. He should have finished up and gotten out.", "You did say he\u2019s 27 right?

Literally came out. On to her lap and onto the bathroom floor. Her husband (a doctor) had to wipe her butt, hold/catch her intestines and call for an ambulance. He never whinged about anything. \n\nI had to have major surgery four times, the third time, recovery was really brutal. My better half never once complained or made me feel anything other than being his first priority. He certainly never yelled at me. \n\nYes these two examples are medically related, serious times and this was how the men in our lives treated us, with respect and compassion. You needed to poop and he\u2019s going on about it like a soap opera. \n\nThere\u2019s men\u2026then there\u2019s boys pretending to be men.

I don't poop in front of my husband. We live in a 2 br 1 bath, we both are lactose intolerant, we try to hold it as long as possible until the other gets out of the bathroom, sometimes will frantically yell and text to get out saying it's code brown, meaning our ass is kissing our undies goodbye. At that point, we need to sit down on the toilet because it's only a matter of time.

Emergencies happen sometimes. NTA", "What I will say though, is that a healthy adult should be able to hold their poop for 15m. I had an issue where my wife seemed to ALWAYS need to poop the second I got in the shower which after months of being fucked off with her about it I discovered that she was just being lazy and would only go when she was fucking turtlenecking or something so of course she couldn\u2019t wait 15m if I happened to go in when she was just about to burst. I told her she needed to start going as soon as she needed to poop and started saying no when she asked to come in and the problem is much better now.\n\nEdit: wooowww people are going nuts over this so to clarify. I am aware that everyone will deal with unexpected bowel movements occasionally - in that case of course I vacate the bathroom for my wife. But suddenly being DESPERATE  every time I went in to the bathroom (which happens at wildly unpredictable times of day so this isn\u2019t a morning poop thing either) is not an occasional problem, that is a pattern we needed to get to the bottom of. I am certain that there was no other health issue going on because of course my first suggestion was that if she really genuinely can\u2019t hold her bowels for 15m (which she can do in a car though) then I really thought that needed a gastroenterologist and we should arrange for her to see one. She was adamant there was no health problem (and there is no shame between either of us, we both do regular poop updates). \n\nThere is nothing deeper to this, no mystery to solve here. It was at this point that it transpired that when she noticed she needs to poo she doesn\u2019t go then, she hangs around, sometimes for hours until she NEEDS TO GO NOW. That combined with then panicking that me being in the bathroom would mean that when she hit her \u2018you\u2019ve got 30 seconds to save yourself\u2019 came that she wouldn\u2019t have access to a toilet. It was absolutely nothing other than a combination of laziness and not wanting to break focus combined with a smattering of bowel anxiety and probably an ever so slightly weak pelvic floor compared to other healthy 30 yeah old childless women. Not only is holding your poop for hours horrible for your bowels but it also resulted in my request to please let me have my shower time in peace if possible (we live in a very small flat with not much privacy and this was during covid so we were very in each other\u2019s space) being ignored almost every single time. \n\nSince I asked her to please start going earlier on in the process between \u2018it\u2019s on its way\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ve shit myself\u2019 and especially as I pointed out that if this happened during one of my bowel issue episodes I genuinely wouldn\u2019t be able to help her the problem is solved. She shits before she has to waddle to the loo, and I get to shower in peace. There is no drama. I never even locked the door and she knew that so if she really genuinely was going to have an accident she could have come in. \n\nAnd if she ever told me now she urgently needed the loo I would take that as a genuine poo emergency and vacate the bathroom or tell her to just come in if I had a head full of shampoo and she needed it faster than that or something. Even if it was a wine poo or eating a 5 day old chicken salad. \n\nFor any of you that truly believe I should have happily let my wife ask me to do every single shower in two halves please go ahead and start doing this to your partners for every. Single. Shower and see how long it takes them to question what the fuck is going on!\n\nA lot of you also seem to be confusing boundaries and control. I was asking her to please respect that I had asked for 15m of undisturbed private alone time a day, baring genuine emergencies, if there was no medical reason to not be able to respect that need. We talked about it and troubleshooted what the issue was and I would have supported her with any medical issues she was having\u2026.

Heck, if there weren't non-family members in the home, the door was rarely even shut unless someone was taking a poo. Even then, the door still stayed unlocked or at least just touching the door frame. People were in and out of the bathroom like it was a metro station because of everyone's different schedules: work, elementary school, middle school, high school, dates, etc. Whether it was makeup, brushing teeth, using the toilet or showering, if someone needed to do something in there then they were going to be in there.\n\nHalfway through college, I started living exclusively with men. First, my ex-boyfriend/ex-fianc\u00e9, then just guy roommates. Still the bathroom door always stayed unlocked. The door was now shut out of courtesy. Only when I lived with the guy roommates was a knock given as a warning of entry. It allowed a few seconds of closing a shower curtain or, if you felt modest, to throw a towel over your lap while on the toilet (rarely done) After everyone got over modesty, it wasn't anything we hadn't seen before. We all knew each other and we good friends, so there wasn't much we hid since we knew we'd be around each other round the clock for at least a year.\n\nAt one point, I was pregnant living with a guy roommate. I became high risk 4 months in and had to stay off my feet for long periods of time. He'd sometimes use the toilet, wash up, and then wait the few minutes I needed to position for him to help me get up out of my bath. It was a strange dynamic, and we'd hold a conversation the entire time. And after getting dressed, we'd watch stupid movies using my belly as a popcorn table. Best roommate ever.\n\nI am married now, and my husband has a saying: bathroom time is private time. Even when he's shaving, he shuts the door. I now make him leave it unlocked though. I always knock and I never go in if he is on the toilet or in the shower. It's his one thing. But we have 3 bathrooms, 2 up and 1 down. But he knows that if I really *have* to pee when he's in the shower and a kid is in theirs, I *will* use ours when he's washing up rather than risk running downstairs and across the house. But I still leave the bathroom door open in the middle of the night or when he's not in the room. If I hear him coming, I just shout a warning that I'm in there so he's aware if he comes around the corner. Lol.\n\nMoral of the story: your boyfriend sucks. This is a part of living together. Especially with one bathroom. You have to accommodate the moments when your partner will want/need something while you are in the bathroom. Just knock first and give him a warning that you are coming in. It gives him a chance to \"prepare\" himself appropriately.", "Absolutely without a doubt NTA.

Also, judging by the bf's reaction there's a chance OP has done this several times before.\nAnd she could also have told her bf to get out for a sec as well but honestly there needs to be more context to be able to make a conclusion..\nBut telling rhe bf to shower faster isn't a great solution (at least in my opinion)", "I mean\u2026 it can be \u201cin dire need\u201d \n\nI am a healthy person, but sometimes my tummy is just crazy and when I gotta go.

I have absolutely no doubt that me and my wife would feel just generally happier and less\u2026.compressed if we had a second bedroom (to use as an office and when we\u2019re really disturbing each other\u2019s sleep) and second bathroom. Our place is very small and started feeling more and more claustrophobic during covid and subsequently with me spending a lot of time at home due to health issues. And the shared bathroom situation is especially bad since last year because I developed a severe gastrointestinal condition that at its worst meant I had diarrhoea up to 20x a day and night. \n\nBut it\u2019s just completely out of our price range to move somewhere bigger, and we have great security where we are now too which is something you can\u2019t underestimate from a mental health standpoint. Even a one bed privately rented in zone 3 flat in London is \u00a31500 now and unless you go to pretty high end new builds a second bathroom is not common here on a two bed - actually it\u2019s not even uncommon to find three beds with just one bathroom despite them potentially being considered the right size for 6 people! Even just a second toilet would make a big difference to the toilet timing pressure though.\n\nLuckily we have a council flat now which works out at about \u00a31000 a month but does include the service charges and heating (but not hot water for showers because when they converted the bathroom to a wet room for my disability they installed an electric shower meaning I effectively pay for it twice). But you don\u2019t really get the choice to move under the council scheme - most people don\u2019t even get a place at all so we\u2019re luckily in that sense, but this is kind of it for the foreseeable. \n\nTo buy one of those shared ownership (supposedly \u2018affordable\u2019) schemes in somewhere that arguably isn\u2019t even London at all it\u2019s so far out, with 2 beds 2 baths would be about \u00a32000 - \u00a32500 plus bills and a deposit of \u00a310-25k probably so I\u2019m not really sure who that is \u2018affordable\u2019 to! If my wife earned \u00a3115,000 that would put those housing costs in the supposedly affordable percentage range (a third) but the schemes cap at 90k anyway. And\u2026. She doesn\u2019t earn either of those figures. It\u2019s just insane here now and I can\u2019t see it\u2019s going to get any better. And if we\u2019re finding it insane I don\u2019t know how people with a smaller income are even beginning to cost.\n\nSo poop Tetris is the way it is for us sadly!
