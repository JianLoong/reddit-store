I understand that your sister wanted to say goodbye, but what mattered most was that your cat doesn\u2019t suffer unnecessarily! Your sister is old enough and should understand that.", "N A H.\n\nFuture veterinarian here. First, let me say I'm so very sorry for your family's loss & I'm extending my deepest sympathies to you all \ud83d\udc9c\n\nYou're not an AH because you did the best you could in that moment for your cat. The vet told you he was suffering & you chose to relieve him of that suffering, which is one of the greatest acts of kindness you can do. \n\nYour sister isn't an AH because due to the circumstances, she couldn't say goodbye the way she wanted to & she wasn't there to see with her own eyes that he was in pain & distress, so she may think it could have waited. Be gentle with her right now - she's grieving, too. \n\nI'm wishing your family love & strength in this time \ud83d\udc9c", "I'm sorry for your (and your family's) loss. Losing a four legged family member is hard.\n\nI'm going tentatively with NAH. Your sister responded rudely, but she's probably lashing out because she's also grieving. You saw your little old man suffering and you took him to get immediate care. You had no control over when his suffering began, and it would've been cruel to extend it. Death and pain don't circle around our conveniences. You did the best you could for him.", "NTA - I mean, you rushed without waiting your sister because you probably thought that the vet could do something. I think I would do the same thing for my cat.", "NTA. It's totally selfish from your sister to wish your cat would suffer longer so she could get to say goodbye.\n\nThis cat was a living being, not a toy. He was actively suffering, you did what was best for him. \n\nI am sorry for your loss :(", "It wouldn\u2019t have made it any better if you had forced that cat to suffer until she got home, the timing is unfortunate and she\u2019s probably just dealing with her grief in a not so nice way. NAH.", "NTA.  You put the needs of ending the cat's suffering first.  Cats aren't humans, they don't and won't understand the concept of \"hanging on just to say goodbye to loved ones\" they're just suffering.\n\nI understood that when we lost our first cat at 9 years old, your sister may be acting out of grief but is old enough to understand the concepts of mercy and reducing suffering.\n\nThe hug would've been for her, not for the cat and she needs to understand that, and is old enough to.", "NTA.\nAs much as it hurts your sister, you did the right thing. Making sure your cat doesn't suffer longer than necessary should be your first priority.", "NTA\n\nWhile it is sad that your sister didn\u2019t get to say goodbye, you did the right thing in not letting your cat suffer any longer.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "No, no you are not the AH. Thank you for not making the animal suffer. Your sister would have felt worse for making that animal wait for her and realizing she was the cause of unnecessary pain. If it wasn't possible to wait, you shouldn't have, and your sister will understand one day. She's just hurting right now and lashing out. When she calms down, have a talk about it and cry together.", "NTA - when it\u2019s time sometimes it\u2019s time. The cat would have been just suffering longer if you waited longer. I think the situation could have been addressed when the vet said to enjoy everyday that he had left with you. You could have talked to your sister and explained that it could be any time. If it is important to her she could have given him a goodbye hug and spent a moment with the cat any time that she had to leave. It\u2019s hard. She is upset because her pet is gone. Maybe could have better prepared her but you are NTA.", "Very much NTA, & I'm so sorry about your beloved cat. But it was a critical situation, and you acted in the best interest of your pet so he wouldn't suffer. I know how tough that is. I'm sorry your sister is taking her grief out on you, but she's almost an adult and knew your cat was unwell. You weren't being spiteful, just handling a rough situation on your own. I'm sorry if she didn't spend extra time with your cat as he declined, but that's not on you. Sending hugs \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. We owe our pets a dignified death with the least amount of pain as possible; making your cat agonize further would have been cruel.\n\nYour sister should understand this. She is selfish to think that whether or not she was able to say goodbye was more important than the comfort of the cat in its last moments.", "NTA.\n\nThe cat was in distress and the vet was giving the best advice possible. It would have been cruel to make the cat suffer by prolonging his discomfort.\n\nEverything passes in time.", "NTA - you did what needed to be done. It is sad that your sister could not be there, but making your cat suffer to wait for her would have been a total AH move. I am so very sorry you have lost your  \"old man\", but easing his way across the Rainbow Bridge was the last kind thing you could do for him.", "NTA, you did what was best for the cat. I\u2019m sorry for your sister, but it would\u2019ve been cruel to prolong his suffering for who knows how long just so she could say goodbye. I\u2019ve lost two pets long distance in the past couple years and it\u2019s absolutely devastating, but you still did the right thing.", "NTA -\n\nI am sorry you had to do this. It is one of the hardest parts of having pets. \n\nI am sorry that your sister didn't get to say goodbye - however you all knew it was just a matter of time so she should have been making the most of the time she had with him. \n\nYes, it's upsetting but did she want the poor thing to suffer a few more hours before she could get out of school and say goodbye? What if he died before you got him to the vet - before she got home?  \n\nOnly in a perfect world do we get to chose the time or always say goodbye before someone (including pets) passes away. Our world is far from perfect.  It is sad, it is hard, but you are NOT to blame.  Your beloved cat was suffering and needed intervention to be at peace, not let to suffer until school was out or everyone to get home.", "NTA\n\nThis was an urgent situation and it would have been horribly unfair to make the poor kitty suffer when there was no hope of medical intervention.  It's a shame that others couldn't say goodbye, but you clearly did the right thing.  I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. As sad as this situation is, I think you did the right thing.  I'm sure your sister will come around to realize this as well. That poor kitty was suffering and in pain, so it was crucial that you allow him to pass away peacefully as soon as possible.\n\nPerhaps there could have been some level of communication as you did it, like perhaps a family call or Facetime before/during the euthanasia, but, ultimately, what you did was for the best for the cat.\n\nTry to sit down with your sister and discuss this with her. She deserves an explanation and is clearly hurting too, so I'm sure explaining your stance on this will help ease the situation.\n\nI'm sorry for your family's loss, sounds like they were a great little kitty.", "NTA.  You did right by the cat.", "nta..your cat was suffering and would have most likely died a much different death had you waitted, you did the right thing\n\nyour sister is just upset, when she has had some time you can explain to her what happened \n\nI am so sorry for your loss, putting down a pet is never easy", "NTA and you should use this as a learning experience for you sister. Having a pet means being responsible for their well-being and forcing an animal to suffer so you can get extra time is cruel. Animals don't understand the concept of saying goodbye. You did the right thing.\n\nFor anyone who thinks you should have FaceTime, called or waited, when a vet is telling you your pet is suffering and it's time, that's all you're thinking about. Not only that, but most animals will be extra stressed and confused at a vet. Forcing an already sick and old cat to sit in a crate while you get people together to say goodbye, would be a horrible last few moments for the animal. Let your pet go with dignity and love.", "NTA at all. I'm sorry for your loss, the whole situation sounds awful. \n\nIn the end all that matters is you did what's best for your cat and keeping him in pain so your sister could say goodbye was not what was best for him. Saying that, I wouldn't take her comments to heart too much. It must be hard for her too knowing she wasn't there.", "Did the vet say it should be done right then? Was there anything that could have been done to make the cat comfortable until your sister was out of school? Could your sister have gotten out of school early?", "NTA. it can be very hard but you did right by your little old man. he was suffering and scared and the best thing you could have done was relieve him of that, which you did. It's very sad for your sister that she couldn't also say goodbye to your beloved pet, but prolonging the poor cat's suffering, a cat who does not understand or know about the concept of saying goodbye to loved ones before death, would be cruel. Your old man had to go and three hours was too long of a wait. I'm so sorry for the loss OP, and my love is with you and your family in this hard time.", "Edit1 : my cat was sedated and on painkillers. The vet said HE WAS NOT SUFFERING while they waited for me. \n\nEdit 2: I was 3 hours away. Of course I left work early. \n\nYTA, **probably**. My family has put a cat down who was poisoned with antifreeze we suspect. I was at work when my wife took him to the vet but she left him there, gathered up the kids, waited 3 hours for me to get off work, and then we all went and said goodbye to him together. \n\nI don't know if your cat could have survived until your younger sister could have been there but you should have pursued it. Since your story doesn't include asking the vet if that was possible I'm going to assume you didn't ask.\n\nWhen loved ones are dying you need to consider all the family members.
