Your parents' viewpoint would be considered quite silly here.\n\nYour brother is an adult. He is over the legal drinking age of the resort location. He did not break the law.\n\nAbove all, you are not your brother's keeper. His decisions, good or bad, are his alone. For you to attempt to police his behavior risks damaging your relationship.\n\nYour parents are getting \"super pissed\" at the wrong person.

Puts the question (and drinking age law) in a new light?", "NTA. The Stupid drinking age laws are. Do they actually stop any one from drinking? It's 18 here but I don't know a single person who wasn't getting hammered at 14. Better to teach responsible drinking that blanket ban.

You are not his parent nor keeper.\n\nAnd yeah the hypocrisy of legislation that allows citizens to drive, to join the army, to have sex, to have babies, to get married... so much younger than they are allowed todrink alcohol is barmy to me!", "NTA  As you said, your brother was of drinking age where you were.  Neither he nor you did anything that was legally or morally wrong.  Your parents are being completely unreasonable.  At least they had the decency save it until you got home and not to ruin your vacation.", "I\u2019m so confused by this. Why did they take you guys to an all inclusive within a country where it was legal for your brother to drink if they didn\u2019t want that happening?", "The drinking age being 21 in the us is so fucking stupid. Anyways, he did nothing illegal, he\u2019s an adult, no one got hurt, and your parents should not expect you to do \u00abtheir job\u00bb even though it\u2019s not their job to stop an adult from legally drinking.", "NTA.

They are his parents, not you. If they weren't so busy enjoying their time to themselves, they could have prevented him from drinking.

Sounds like a good time.", "Nta, are your parents always babying the little brother?", "NTA I have 2 older teens, when we went abroad last year they were allowed to drink legally in that country. I let them whilst keeping an eye they didn't make any dick moves, that's the way to teach them responsibility in my personal opinion", "NTA, he's an adult and it is legal in the country you are in.

The notion of the age of 21 and being draconian with drinking in the US (I assume where you're from) is why there is so much binge drinking.", "NTA he\u2019s legally an adult and in a country where he can legally drink.

You can vote at 18. You can be tried as an adult younger than 18. You can drive at what, 16? In a lot of states you can get married at 16 or younger. You can own a gun. \n\nBut you can't drink till you're 21. How crazy is that!\n\nAlso, C) see point A).", "NTA. Is they were that concerned about under age drinking they shouldn\u2019t have gone to a country with a lower drinking age and an all inclusive resort.

Hope y'all had fun!", "NTA\n\nYou aren't his parent, the decisions he makes is none of your concern. If they cared that much about it they should've said something at the resort. Even so, it still would'nt have been your problem.", "Correct.\n\nParents shouldn't have created this situation in the first place.\n\nHaving an issue with him drinking and then taking you boys to a holiday resort that legally serves, surprise, alcohol to an 18 yo adult seems pretty counterintuitive to say the least... I mean a blind man could have seen that coming...\n\nNTA, obviously.", "It used to be 18+ in the 80's but they changed the laws because of drunk driving accidents.", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t underage - he was of legal drinking age.", "American drinking age is just kinda dumb considering they let 16 year olds drive cars...\nIt just all over the place with their regulations.", "Old enough to join the military and be taught to kill.", "Absolutely agreed, and this is nitpicky, but you can get a learner's permit in some states, like Iowa, as young as *fourteen*. That's a whole other issue, but it's especially odd when looking at the seven year difference between drinking age and driving age. \n\nI think the drinking age is something to do with religious values that are still being held onto. But what I don't get is the whole \"you can't tell us what to do\" when it comes to masking and vaccines, but drinking? Yeah let's keep that at 21. It's ridiculous and hypocritical."]}
