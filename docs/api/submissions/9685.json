Either a normal one or even an eBike.\n\nIf you are able to cycle on segregated cycle paths then it is a softer way to improve your awareness of navigating around other bikes, dealing with traffic signs and signals, etc. And if it feels too much then getting off and pushing for a bit is an option. There might even be guided rides by bike groups or charities to get you started. There are often women only groups too (British Cycling Breeze rides are one of those).

I have lived on many streets in my life where older women do not drive either. I haven't driven myself for ten years as I have a medical condition like a lot of people.

Plus in the USA so much of it is very unwalkable unless you live in a small town. Your aunts are treating you like your mum's live in carer, but you have your own life to live.
