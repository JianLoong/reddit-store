If you are done with them that's the end of it, why put emotional stress on yourself that you don't need. I've always hated that just because someone is family they expect access to you. \n\nI recently filed a DVRO against my father and my mother tells me he said in therapy that he \"missed me\". My response was \"Why? He has never bothered to get to know me as a person and calls me an idiot despite the fact I am more educated than he will ever be. Something HE pushed for???\" Like what?!?! \ud83e\udd74What is he missing? He has literally said to my face in front of my entire family that he never wanted me. So wtf could he possibly miss????????? It's a guilt trip, they want you to feel guilty for THEIR feelings. I have so much less stress now that I don't have to talk to him. \n\nTell your aunt you have made your choice long ago and it is none of her business.", "NTA,\n\nthis isnt a place to ask for advice....but obviously everyone gives it anyway\n\neverything you described is totally messed up and you acted correctly in my mind\n\n>But she looked really disappointed though, saying that after they raised me they deserve some sympathy or at least proper closure.\n\nbut whats your relationship with your aunt like...you dont 'owe' anything to them or your aunt per-se but obviously it seems to matter to your aunt whom you seem to speak to and it would likely be something she would very much appreciate you doing.\n\nSo you could be the better person they dont deserve and go there to simply 'officially' cut ties", "NTA you don't owe them anything, raising you is what they owe you.", "nta, they disrespected your boundaries and tried to harm your pet. you have every right to prioritize your own well-being and safety.", "nta. they disrespected you and your pet. they don't deserve your sympathy or closure.", "nta. they made their choices and now have to face the consequences. you owe them nothing. family doesn't give them a free pass to mistreat you.", "So, let me get this straight, your parents blamed you when your sister tried to kill your dog?  NTA!", "NTA. That\u2019s the risk people make by having kids. Raising children is a parents responsibility and it\u2019s not something they can hold over your head. I haven\u2019t spoken with my father for over 10 years, my brother spoke to him briefly when he called and demanded our family photos.

Corners were cut long before the fraud conviction, right? \n\nThe best place for family like that is not in your life at all.
