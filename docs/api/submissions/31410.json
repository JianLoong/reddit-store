If you are done with them that's the end of it, why put emotional stress on yourself that you don't need. I've always hated that just because someone is family they expect access to you. \n\nI recently filed a DVRO against my father and my mother tells me he said in therapy that he \"missed me\". My response was \"Why? He has never bothered to get to know me as a person and calls me an idiot despite the fact I am more educated than he will ever be. Something HE pushed for???\" Like what?!?! \ud83e\udd74What is he missing? He has literally said to my face in front of my entire family that he never wanted me. So wtf could he possibly miss????????? It's a guilt trip, they want you to feel guilty for THEIR feelings.

There\u2019s some kind of absurd delusion Americans live in where parents think they\u2019re entitled to their children for some reason. Like they treat you like shit and say \u201cI RAISED YOU\u201d when it\u2019s like yeah you chose to bring a human being into the world that had no say in the matter and you fulfilled your legal obligation to feed clothe and shelter a child great work that\u2019s the bare minimum lol. Your parents made their choices and you have zero obligations to them no matter what anyone says.

Corners were cut long before the fraud conviction, right? \n\nThe best place for family like that is not in your life at all.

If they've sent you letters or whatever then that might hold some truth, otherwise, nah.  And lets be real, once in prison people naturally want \"friends\" and long lost family to start sending them money.", "They chose to have a child.  Raising that child was their responsibility when having a child.  While I am a person that preaches forgiveness, I also understand letting go and cutting people off.  You can forgive without giving someone what they want.  I am not sure if your parents are true A's, but honestly, I definitely don't think you are wrong with your decision.  Their decision to side with your sister and not understanding the fact that you don't want to get rid of your dog, let alone the fact that your sister, a GIANT A, tried to murder your dog.  I don't think you owe them a visit.  It is great that they are reflecting on their mistakes, and maybe they want to apologize, but you have your closure and you WNBTA if you choose to not visit. \n\nAgain, you, NTA.  Parents do suck, sister SUPERA", "You chose well when you chose the dog.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI hope they were convicted for cruelty to animals.  That would be so poetic.", "NTA\n\nParents do not deserve anything from you for doing what they were legally obligated to do once they brought you into this world.\n\nLast I checked, prisoners can write letters. If they miss you and want you to visit, they can write you...starting with apologies for supporting your sister when she tried to poison your dog of 12 years.", "YTA I\u2019m gonna go ahead and disagree with the popular Reddit notion of \u201cyou don\u2019t owe your parents anything\u201d\n\nBy the sounds of it you fell out with them after becoming an adult. If they raised you without abuse, provided for you and at least made some attempt at giving you an opportunity to succeed then the truth is you do owe them, you owe them a lot. Do you have to forgive them and pretend you don\u2019t have any gripes with them at all? No but cutting them off without even hearing what they have to say is immature, especially given the circumstances. Most people on Reddit advise you always to avoid the uncomfortable because it\u2019s far easier in the short term to cut people off than to attempt to make amends. Even if you don\u2019t give a shit now, even if you can\u2019t stand them, the fact is when they\u2019re gone the idea of having that conversation you\u2019re avoiding so much won\u2019t sound so bad after all. When it comes to this kinda stuff, regrets over having not done something is far worse than regret over having done it", "YTA", "My proper closure would be me sending them a letter saying they deserve this", "NTA. Sounds like they had several years out free to make amends and reconnect with you and they didn\u2019t. Even if they really do have regrets and want to fix their relationship with you, I think it\u2019s still on them to reach out and apologize first instead of putting it all on you to make that effort. If you *want* to go see them and think it will bring *you* closure as well, that\u2019s understandable, feelings are complicated. But I don\u2019t think you owe them closure at the expense of your own peace when they were the ones who fucked up.", "Nta\n\nSee ya in 10 years (maybe)", "NTA.  From what you have written it sounds like you aren\u2019t the problem but your family believes you are.  They aren\u2019t in a position to pass judgement over you.  It\u2019s a major red flag when someone commits an act of cruelty to animals and others seek to excuse that behavior.  You don\u2019t need such people in your own home or in your life for that matter.

Probably would have gone to jail too after I beat him senseless. Oof.", "He did. He pulled me aside and was livid. He was like \"did you seriously kill your wife's fucking dog? What the fuck is wrong with you?!\" He loved that dog. He used to come by and pick her up to hangout with her for the day. He calmed down when he realized I didn't actually kill the dog. He just decided to vouch for me to the soulless corporation to get a raise out of it.", "From the sound of it, the boss simply meant it as a joke.
