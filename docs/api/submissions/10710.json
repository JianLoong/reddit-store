YTA for your delivery, but I do get your reasoning", "How old are you?", "You seem young, so I\u2019ll be a bit more explanatory here.\n\nFirst -\n\nBirthday celebrations are also flexible. As you grow older you\u2019ll realize this.\n\nYour grandparent didn\u2019t choose a day to die. Your dad didn\u2019t want to have to change your celebration - but the real life, big picture reality is that arranging a funeral, organizing all of the associated items, dealing with his own grief, dealing with family coming from out of town, is a lot. Try to have just a little empathy and compassion here.\n\nSorry, but it is easier and more logical to change the birthday party - typically smaller, easier logistics, and so forth. I\u2019m a dad, and love my daughters as much as anything in the world, and I\u2019d have done the same thing.\n\nSecond -\n\nIt isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but your own that you feel this need to associate your birthday to your grandparent passing. We don\u2019t really get to choose when we die. Once again, that is not dad\u2019s fault nor would it be his choice. That\u2019s all on you. \n\nThird - \n\nSpeaking of you, you are making all of this all about YOU. Try to be a little less self centered and selfish.

Think about it.\n\nYTA", "I thought you were probably quite young when this happened and maybe now you\u2019re sensing you were incredibly selfish and callous toward your dad.

If you are super bothered by this, you may need therapy to help process all of your emotions because I'm getting more of a feeling that you are still grieving \n\nWould you rather your dad has rushed through planning the funeral, less people be able to attend, and make your grandfather's funeral not have as much nearly meaning? That would take away from his memory. What happened, is what needed to happen", "My grandma died on my 18th birthday. Get over yourself.", "Maybe he did... Feels like something my grandmother might do lol", "I honestly can't make a ruling here. Speaking as someone who has endured a lot of family loss in a very short amount of time ~~8 people in three years; not covid related, happened many years before that~~  , also when I was very young, I understand both sides. Loss is always devastating to the people closest to the deceased. Your father's dad died. He was DEVASTATED. I'm not surprised that he wanted things to move along quickly, and men especially (at least in my family) want to get all this loss and pain over with as soon as possible. He's not at fault for that. But one thing I've learned is that you can't always let grief stop you from living your life, and things like birthdays should still be celebrated even in the midst of the grief. Your grandfather most likely did not mean to pass just before your birthday. I'm sure if he could have prevented that from happening, he would have. I'm sure he would've wanted your birthday to be celebrated as planned too.   \nYou're not at fault for wanting your birthday to go ahead either. And I DEFINITELY don't think you're at fault for not wanting the funeral to be on that day. I know so many of the birth dates, death dates, and funeral dates of the people in my life who have passed, and every year, when they come around, it still stings. And it's been 11 years since the first death. That's not to mention holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Mother's Day, Father's Day, even the 4th of July, and then my remaining family's birthdays, and family reunions...events where you look around the table/room, and see quiet, empty chairs where there should be family and laughter. None of them feel the same now, to the point where I don't look forward to them anymore. The pain is enough on any normal occasion after a family member passes, and I couldn't IMAGINE having that event also be the date of a funeral. You're not at fault for wanting to prevent this extra pain that will only keep on for the rest of your life. Your birthday won't feel the same any more, and that sucks.   \nAll this being said, sometimes these things aren't preventable, and we just have to roll with it. Life happens and gets in the way. Take me for instance! This year was my Golden Birthday (you turn the age that your birthdate is, so if you're turning 14 on October 14th, for example, that's called your Golden Birthday!) I had heard about this when I was about 7 years old, and had been looking forward to it ever since. I knew nothing huge or life-altering was gonna happen, but I was looking forward to all the gold decorations, lol! Well, I planned a party, and bought all the decorations, and trotted out the ones I'd been hoarding for years. Then....I had to get a dental procedure done a few weeks before, and it was supposed to be done before my birthday and all would go as planned. Well, the dentist MAJORLY fucked up. I was in massive amounts of pain and couldn't eat solid food for three weeks, not to mention it induced a big anxiety attack that lasted about a week, including on my birthday. I had little choice but to cancel *everything*. I did not get my Golden Birthday. It sucks major ass, but it's something I will have to live with now. My Aunt suggested that we have a do-over, since I didn't have any celebration, not even cake, and we celebrate on my half birthday instead.   \n\n\nI think you and your family ought to come up with a solution like celebrating your half birthday!", "YTA. My cousin died 4 days before my birthday and his funeral was on my anniversary. I went to a funeral on my anniversary...I didn't mind because there would be more anniversaries to come but only one funeral. And in the years since, his death has not overshadowed my birthday or anniversary. You saying celebrating it a day later just makes you seem like a brat.", "INFO: how old are you? Going by your post I\u2019d guess around 14-15 when you wrote this?\n\nListen, with time you\u2019ll (hopefully) realise that a funeral is more important than a birthday. With even more time passing chances are you\u2019ll be responsible for arranging a funeral yourself and get more insight in what is logistically possible.

Your family was grieving. It is immensely selfish and self-centered to demand that your birthday be celebrated over your grandfather\u2019s funeral. Telling your dad that his recently deceased father will still be dead in two days, as a reason to celebrate your birthday instead, is incredibly callous. \n\nPlease do some serious self reflection. Though I can\u2019t be sure, you sound like a teenager. Basic empathy is something you should understand by now. You need to apologize to your father. A genuine, real apology. Grief and loss trump a birthday. It might help to do some research about the psychological and emotional effects of grief so that you can understand what your family was feeling. Think outside of yourself. \n\nYou seem young. If you don\u2019t do the work now to become a compassionate human, you will end up very lonely. I\u2019ve met people like that, they are not happy.

Your family (and you) would benefit from such growth.", "Honey, just about every day of the year could have a negative association if you have a long life or a big family.  Gotta roll with it.", "ESH\nMainly because your dad raised you to be selfish and lack empathy.", "Okay Ik there\u2019s a lot of Y-T-A votes but I say Esh Ik she handed the situation totally wrong and she could have done better to the people grieving but at the same time every year on her birthday everyone\u2019s gonna think \u201cthis is the day we put grandpa in the ground how dare u celebrate\u201d and she\u2019ll never get to spend her birthday the way she wants because everyone with remember the day differently.", "You have a very low EQ. YTA.", "How fucking old are you? You know what, never mind, you\u2019re still TA.", "How old are u? 8? YTA", "INFO: how old are you? If you are <17 or so, you\u2019re still wrong but it\u2019s understandable. Birthdays come every year so they don\u2019t take precedence over one-time events, like weddings or funerals, especially when you\u2019re juggling extended family schedules. But if you\u2019re a child, of course you wouldn\u2019t have experienced this before, and your parent should have compassionately explained to you and been patient with you. \n\nIf you are a whole ass adult, then I\u2019d say y t a because adult birthdays are just so, so relatively unimportant.", "i had a similar situation and felt this way\u2026 when i was 12. YTA", "ESH \n\nYou for being entitled.\n\nYour dad for being blinded by grief.\n\nThe pastor for not putting 2 and 2 together. \n\n\nBad situation all around.", "I'm going against the grain here, but NTA. I get how you feel. My mother was killed days before my 9th birthday and her funeral was on my birthday.", "never heard something so immature in my life, i'm so embarrassed for you. YTA", "You're choosing to associate his death with your birthday. Simply accept the timeline and move on. \n\nNAH", "No, it's every birthday from now on. It's not about celebrating the birthday, it's about not having the funeral on the birthday. Massive difference here.", "Yeah. OP is a massive TA. My grandfather passed away on my birthday. In our culture we perform the last rites as soon as possible. So funeral happened on my birthday. I didn\u2019t threw a fit like a spoiled teenager even though it was my 19th birthday. \n\nOP I don\u2019t know if you were close to your grandfather or not. But I was and it was devastating. To this day I have bittersweet emotions on my birthday. But never in million years I would say something as hurtful as you said.\n\nI have a huge list of bad birthday\u2019s but I understood long ago that certain things are outside your control l. You sound very young and I hope you mature with time.", "checking their profile, they are 15 and were 13 then\n\nkids are dumb", "My aunt's birthday is Sept 11, as well. Her husband of almost forty years died on Sept 12 (not the same year). You can imagine she doesn't do much celebrating around her actual birthday date anymore. :(", "Yes, everyone is focused on the impact this year but it's the ongoing reminder that would have been better to avoid. My Grandad died on my birthday and after that every year my Nanny would ring me up to wish me happy birthday but couldn't stop herself from mentioning it being the anniversary of his death because the two were then so strongly associated. Had it just been about this year's party I agree she should have been more considerate.", "I\u2019m not trying to argue, but do people actually remember funeral dates? I can\u2019t remember when my grandparents passed away exactly and certainly not the specific day of the funeral.", "i posted this now cuz my friend told me to post here, 2 years ago i didnt even know what reddit was for. Before i posted this i kinda knew that IATA and just wanted to know what people think about this", "How inconsiderate of him!", "My mum died quite close to my birthday and we ended up having a funeral a couple of days before my birthday it was a weird time to say the least", "The fact remains that 2 years after the event you\u2019re still talking about it to your friends who\u2019ve clearly had enough and hope you find another outlet for it. \n\n\nFunerals take way more planning than arranging a priest it very likely couldn\u2019t be moved. Move on from this and try to mature a bit so you can start recognizing that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "Sorry to your family that they have to be around you. I really doubt that this is the extent of your self-centeredness. YTA.", "Which means you still bring it up to your friend enough he decided to shut you up by getting the whole subreddit to tell you that YTA", "I understand that you're disappointed about your birthday, and that's okay.  It sucks for something like this to land on a special day.\n\nHowever, your grandfather's death was bigger at that time than your birthday.  Your family was grieving, and not only that - it takes a lot of mental and emotional energy to handle the paperwork and arrangements around a funeral, and that's in addition to financial matters that can cause a lot of stress, too.  Funerals and burial arrangements are very expensive.\n\nIt's natural that your family had more on their minds that week than your birthday.  They needed you to be supportive in the ways you can be at your age - not causing additional stress, keeping up with chores, being kind to them.  That sort of thing.\n\nLater in life, you are likely to be in their shoes one day or very similar.", "And yes, that's a bummer... but it happens.  There are only so many days for events to occur on.  My uncle's dad died on Christmas day.  Every Christmas he has the memory of his dad literally having a heart attack at the dinner table.  My grandpa died on Halloween.  Whenever I carve a pumpkin, I remember that the day he died I still had to carve a pumpkin and put on a happy face for my really young kids anyhow.  It doesn't have to ruin your birthday going forward.  I remember, but I still love Halloween.  My uncle remembers, but still does Christmas and enjoys it.  You're not the center of the universe.  Your birthday isn't a sacred day when nothing bad can happen.  I wish it were for all of us, but it's just not.", "You're the asshole, big time", "You would if it was on your birthday.", "So did my mother.", "Right?!  \n\nNo seriously, such is life and I don\u2019t go around fussing like OP albeit they are still a kid, a selfish kid. \n\nThe world still happens on our birthdays or other special days, that is life.\n\nMy mom does make sure to make that day about my birthday, about living and we still honor him as well.", "You don't know their family situation, some people are much closer to their grandparents than their mom or dad.\n\nIt doesn't sound like OP wanted to celebrate their birthday, just that they don't want the date to be stained with grief. Every year now they're gonna associate this grief with their birthday and it may take that joy out of the day for a long time. It's completely understandable to be upset about.", "Okay...so thinking about herself when other people are in pain. Basically what I said.", "Aw muffin", "You still don\u2019t get it , if you can\u2019t see the difference then that\u2019s not my problem"]}
