YTA for your delivery, but I do get your reasoning", "How old are you?", "You seem young, so I\u2019ll be a bit more explanatory here.\n\nFirst -\n\nBirthday celebrations are also flexible. As you grow older you\u2019ll realize this.\n\nYour grandparent didn\u2019t choose a day to die. Your dad didn\u2019t want to have to change your celebration - but the real life, big picture reality is that arranging a funeral, organizing all of the associated items, dealing with his own grief, dealing with family coming from out of town, is a lot. Try to have just a little empathy and compassion here.\n\nSorry, but it is easier and more logical to change the birthday party - typically smaller, easier logistics, and so forth. I\u2019m a dad, and love my daughters as much as anything in the world, and I\u2019d have done the same thing.\n\nSecond -\n\nIt isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but your own that you feel this need to associate your birthday to your grandparent passing. We don\u2019t really get to choose when we die. Once again, that is not dad\u2019s fault nor would it be his choice. That\u2019s all on you. \n\nThird - \n\nSpeaking of you, you are making all of this all about YOU. Try to be a little less self centered and selfish.

Think about it.\n\nYTA", "I thought you were probably quite young when this happened and maybe now you\u2019re sensing you were incredibly selfish and callous toward your dad.

Having it on a weekend is what is most convenient for everybody. It's understandable to have such a sad be so close to a day you want celebrate, but there is nothing you can do about. This is something that is totally out of your control. If you are super bothered by this, you may need therapy to help process all of your emotions because I'm getting more of a feeling that you are still grieving \n\nWould you rather your dad has rushed through planning the funeral, less people be able to attend, and make your grandfather's funeral not have as much nearly meaning? That would take away from his memory. What happened, is what needed to happen", "My grandma died on my 18th birthday. Get over yourself.", "Maybe he did... Feels like something my grandmother might do lol"]}
