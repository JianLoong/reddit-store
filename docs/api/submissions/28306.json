There's no need for you to be intruding at your boyfriend's place on his custody time at all, much less kicking the kid out of his Dad's bed on movie night.\n\nYou should have slept on the couch or even better, stay at your own place when it's their time.", "YTA. Sleep at your own place or put yourself on the couch. You're right to not sleep with children, but you ruined this kid's night with his dad. Everyone here is trying to put it on the dad, but he was trying to include you in something special he does sith his kid and you ruined it bc you can't sleep on a couch for a night?", "NAH\n\nhe's being a kid, dad's being a dad *and* a boyfriend, and you're being uncomfortable with sleeping in the same bed as a teen. I don't see anybody really wrong here.\n\nHe's engaging in a bit of teenage angst about it. You probably didn't ruin the relationship with kiddo, he probably realized some natural changes are taking place and doesn't like it. big feelings", "NAH. It\u2019s totally reasonable not to want a 13 year old boy in bed with you for MANY reasons. \n\nBut beyond that, OP\u2019s boyfriend agreed his son shouldn\u2019t sleep in the bed with them and the tradition, according to OP, is NOT that his son sleeps in the bed with him, it\u2019s just that they watch the movie in the bed. OP was on board with continuing the tradition. \n\nI\u2019m shocked at the Y T A responses. Both the adults agreed he should go to his own bed, and children don\u2019t get to make the rules in a household. Children who call all the shots grow up to be entitled adults. That\u2019s pretty much parenting 101.", "I see this as just normal teen behavior/relations act sometimes.   Maybe you alone go tell him you didn\u2019t mean anything by it ?   Tbh if it were me, I\u2019d do it alone with out the bf", "You just met him two months ago and he already has you in the bed with him in front of his kid?  If I were that kid's mother I'd have a HUGE problem with that.  YOU are the one intruding, not the kid.  Why didn't you just go home or sleep on the couch?  Or stay at your own house so he could have time with his kid?", "NAH\n\nHe's used to sleeping with his dad after watching scary movies for Halloween.\n\nYou're not comfortable sharing a bed with a 13 year old boy.\n\nHe'll learn to deal with it.", "YTA, I get being uncomfortable sleeping beside someone you don't know, but you should've been the one to move. The dad sucks too for allowing this.", "NAH. I probably would\u2019ve removed myself once the son started begging to stay just because he was probably frightened by the movie but I don\u2019t think you meant any harm. It\u2019s an odd situation to find yourself in.", "as someone who has had step parents and has previously navigated that as a child BUT has no kid of their own i would say NTA; he\u2019s 13, that\u2019s 8th or 9th grade and i think he was taking the opportunity to be dramatic about it since you only met 2 months ago. To be honest and fair I very likely would have done the same at 13 because not many people will try to confront you about it since you\u2019re still young, but now as an adult if i was your boyfriend and my partner asked me to ask him to go to his own bed i would without a second thought. His son is young, yes, but he\u2019s not at the age where sleeping with his dad and his dads gf is integral to his development, especially since it was in his (the bed you share, i\u2019m sure) bed and not in a shared room like the couch in the living room. i\u2019m not sure why everyone is saying that you should have slept on the couch when his child has his own room, especially with no note of how long you and your boyfriend have been together.", "YTA\n\nYou should have left the bed. You met this boy 2 months ago? \n\nYou overstepped your boundary love.", "YTA \n\nI think you needed to sleep on the couch \n\nYou were invited into **their** tradition. He\u2019s only 13.

You could\u2019ve slept in the spare room", "YTA- if that\u2019s their little tradition they have then let them have it. Idk what\u2019s wrong with a teenager and his mom or dad lying together. Bro is barely 13 too like cmon he is still a kid you have to let them be. I still hug my parents and lay down with them sometimes but idk what\u2019s your deal with it.", "You're fairly new in this kids' life, and everyone is adjusting.  What you did was \"normal\".  You didn't feel comfortable and reacted.  But in the moment, you didn't think about him and how he feels.  It sounds like he's had his dad all to himself, and now he has to share.  I'd have his dad sit down and talk to him about his feelings.  Stay out of it for now, and only talk to him after his dad talks to him.  For now NTA.", "Big NTA!  \n\nIt is weird, awkward and uncomfortable for a teen to sleep the night in bed with a parent and their new dating partner.   Image it we change the change 13 yo boy to a girl of the woman with a boyfriend staying the night!", "YTA\n\nI don't know what weird issue you have by sharing a bed with a 13 year old, but if I were in that situation I would have gone and slept on the couch if I was the uncomfortable one. Kid was probably having nightmares after the horror movie and wanted to be comforted for a night...its not like he's asking to sleep with you all on a regular basis.", "NTA it\u2019s not appropriate for you to sleep with this boy. His dad shouldn\u2019t have you spend the night if the have traditional plans that include him having his teenage son sleep with him.", "NTA, I would not sleep in the same bed with a teenager that I am not related to and also do not know very well. If I were a mother, I think I would be upset to find out my teenage childs father allowed his new girlfriend to sleep in the same bed as them. I think many of the y t a are from families who are used to co sleeping, there is nothing wrong with it, but that's not the normal for everyone so maybe don't their opinions too seriously. Definitely have an open discussion with your bf about it tho, especially since emotions are so high.", "NAH, but I understand why some would think you are.", "NAH-I understand why you weren\u2019t comfortable with him there but I understand why he\u2019s upset too.", "Esh. Next time sleep one the couch or stay at your place during movie night.", "Super Soft YTA... \n\nI think you simply stepped into a slight mess your boyfriend left out for you with no warning. He made the call, but frankly if I had only met a woman's kids 2 months ago I would never ask to kick them out. I would have just taken myself to the couch. I would consider myself the lower priority in that situation and slowly worked towards making sure I was truly welcome in the home by both in all ways before deciding to do anything to potentially alienate the kid. \n\nI think considering it was dad's call in the end you may need to be careful. Make sure you are not letting him try to force the relationship or disregarding his own kids feelings in any way. Alienating his son at this point should be something you become a little extra careful about. Fair or not... you may now be the bad guy in every decision dad makes for awhile because he listened to you and kicked him out.", "I feel like YTA here, if you felt uncomfortable you could have gone and slept in the kids bed or slept on the sofa like why wake them up when they were already asleep?", "Incredibly soft YTA for both you and BF.\n\nYou're of course allowed to feel uncomfortable that someone you don't know that well is in your bed, but both you and BF could've handled that nicer, or moved to sleep somewhere else. Kids don't always care or \"realize\" they're growing \"too old\" for certain things. Kids sleep around adults when they trust them. Waking them to throw them out negates that. This was a show of trust and both of you broke it.\n\nYou don't have to feel overly guilty, though. It was a peculiar situation and what's happened has happened. Maybe make sure BF reassures his son (without \"blaming\" you for stating boundaries) and listen to each others sides of what's happened and work from there?", "NTA for not wanting to sleep with him in the bed. Some 13 year olds are very mature and you wouldn\u2019t want to be accused of impropriety. But YTA for not just going to the couch.", "Going with NTA, but discussions need to take place.\n\nIt's not your house, so you don't really get a say as of yet. However, if the relationship progresses, that will change, so I don't think setting up boundaries for the bedroom is a bad idea necessarily.\n\nThirteen year old boys are beginning to become young men. They are not 7 year olds. It would be fine for a movie night while you aren't there, but when you're present, it's your and your bfs bed. Does the son have a TV in his room? Is there any way that they can move horror movie night to his room? How about purchasing a very nice air mattress and giving them the living room for the night? Or maybe gift the young man a tv for his bedroom so movie night can take place uniterupted there? Make some fun snacks to leave out for their bonding time?", "This whole story is hilarious to me. No, you're not the asshole. Kid's just throwing a tantrum which he shouldn't be doing at his age. At least not for this reason.  \n\n\nAny 13 year old should have a clear understanding that it's weird to share a bed with your parent and their love interest. Unless there's some emergency right.", "NAH, yes it makes you uncomfortable and thats something they should respect. He is just a kid though, he loves his dad and likes to sleep with him after a scary movie.", "NTA you just met that kid two months ago.", "NTA and you did the right thing. He\u2019ll get over it. Imagine the uproar if he told his mom he slept with you!", "Yes, YTA, my boy is 16 and still jumps in the bed with me sometimes. He doesn\u2019t stay all night anymore, but he definitely did up to 14 if we were watching a game or something. I know it\u2019s different because you are not mom, but still, it\u2019s a son and his dad!  These times are special and should not be infringed upon by you. Boys need their dad! My wife/his mom was also in the bed, he slept on the edge next to me not that we cared either way but wanted to share.", "NTA it is normal for teenagers to not respond to ILU. Don\u2019t take it personal and stand your ground.", "NAH. Yeah, you could have gone to the couch, but if dad didn\u2019t want to kick him out he could\u2019ve said so. I also feel it\u2019s strange for a 13 year old kid to want to sleep with their father so badly. If anything, it\u2019s better that he told him to go to his own bed.", "Yta. It's only weird because you're sexualizing a kid, which is why you felt \"uncomfortable\"", "I don't think I would be comfortable with that either. My ex had a son that I ADORED and still do, but I slept on the couch when he was over. HOWEVER  he usually ended up on the other end of the couch sleeping  (we had a huge sectional) because I let him play Minecraft all night if he wanted to\ud83d\ude02, so it was us two with my French Mastiff somewhere in the middle. Seriously though, NTA.", "YTA. 13 is barely a teen, mostly still a kid who needs love and affection. You have no right to come between a father and his son, especially when it sounds like this is their habit and clearly is important to the kid. If you don\u2019t like it, sleep somewhere else.", "NTA... this is weird behavior that needs to stop immediately", "YTA. way to ruin the moment by intruding on your boyfriend\u2019s and his son\u2019s tradition. they fell asleep together while watching a movie, who cares? take the couch, you\u2019re making this a bigger deal than it actually is. you\u2019ve met him 2 months ago and you aren\u2019t his mother.\n\nYTA", "YTA. It's not your house. You have only been dating for 2 months. You joined them in a special tradition. You had been told in advance what normally happened. You could have let them have that time. You could have decided not to sleep over, knowing the plan was for father and son to share dad's bed. \nDad is also an AH for allowing a gf of only 2 months to displace his kid. \nYou owe both of them an apology.", "SOFT YTA . I get not feeling comfortable sleeping in the same bed as a teen boy but at the same time you should\u2019ve moved yourself and slept on the couch man", "NTA because you asked your boyfriend and he agreed to it, which ultimately makes it his decision.", "NTA - From the perspective of the son, you're staying at his house, sleeping in his dads bed, which is HIS thing, then he's forced to stop his regular routine because you're uncomfortable with it. I completely agree with your point of view OP & think 13 is too old for a child to routinely co sleep if not due to a space/housing issue. But from the newly teenage boy's perspective - you're replacing him. Your BF needs to have a talk with his son...", "Nta at his age the son is way to old to ve sleeping with his dad. Especially if you are in the bed too. Son sounds like an immature little shit.  Dad is failing as a patent if he allows his son to treat you this way.", "**NTA**   The kid is being emotionally manipulative...let his dad handle it.", "Nta - but uh oh, further conversations need to be had as the boy may start to feel resentful and that you are taking his dad away from him. He may be 13 but boys do mature later than girls, so he\u2019s still got attachment to his dad.", "NAH, you were uncomfortable and that\u2019s that. \n\nAlso some 13 year old boys are as tall as adult women. I can\u2019t imagine even sleeping comfortably unless it was a California King. \n\nDad is still continuing the tradition, you\u2019re not stopping that.", "Yeah if yu feel weird sleeping in the same bed as a 13 yr old who\u2019s with his dad you mind going places it shouldn\u2019t be in", "NTA.  The appropriate thing is for him to go to his bed.  He will get over it.", "YTA What do you really think he's going to do to you? Especially if his dad was in the bed with you guys. Was he right next to you or on the other side of his dad? Kind of an odd knee jerk reaction that you think this kid - that you're supposed to like cause he could be your stepson someday - is going to do something just because he's 13. \n\nAnd obviously that time with his dad means something if he's so upset he won't even say 'i love you', you put a stain on the whole thing for him. He's wondering what he did wrong just by existing and doing something that was completely fine until you made it weird.", "And here I am at 32, hanging out in my parents' bed whenever I go visit and we watch a movie at night (and sometimes falling asleep). And by parents, I mean my mum and stepfather \ud83d\ude05\n\nYTA\n\nLet the kid enjoy the time with his dad! I doubt anyone expected you to spoon the 13yo, and everyone was fully dressed \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI'm not saying you aren't entitled to feeling uncomfortable, but if YOU are uncomfortable in THEIR home/bed, you should have found another place to sleep. You could have gone to the couch or back to your place", "NTA but for a different reason.\n\nI do think it would\u2019ve been a good idea to just spend the night on the sofa so you didn\u2019t intrude on your partners tradition with his son, but I also understand your reservations about wanting to share a bed with your partners teenage son.\n\nHere\u2019s a story from my life. My parents split when I was 13. A few years later my mum met someone new (who she\u2019s now engaged to currently). Things would start slow, like he\u2019d come over to our house every other weekend. All I wanted was for my mum to be happy after what my dad put all of us through for years. My younger brother (8yo when our parents split) didn\u2019t feel the same about there being a new guy around. Now it\u2019s worth mentioning that I caught my dad having an affair (that\u2019s a whole other story) AFTER my parents had already separated. So my relationship with my dad went from strenuous at best, to just gone altogether. My brother didn\u2019t know about this at the time due to his age. So when mum met her current partner, he tried SO hard to break them up, because he felt threatened. He didn\u2019t understand why our dad had left and he couldn\u2019t adjust to it. Now the reason I\u2019m mentioning this is because this behaviour continued until well after he was 13 years old. It took a long time and a lot of trust building and bonding between him and mums boyfriend. It\u2019s as simple as that, he felt threatened and worried that this new guy would take our mums attention away from him right after our dad left us all. Which is understandable, given his age at the time of course.\n\nIf this relationship is something you could see yourself in long term, it\u2019s definitely worth speaking to your partner about finding ways to build a relationship with his son. Perhaps a day out with both your kids and his son, and find ways for him to bond with your kids, while you bond with his.\n\nTry not to dwell on what is already done, other than to understand it. Going forward you at least know that there is some kind of connection that needs to be made. But make it clear to his son, that you don\u2019t intend to step on his toes and remove/alter any kind of tradition he has with his father. If he decides he wants to include you in these things, great. But it has to be his choice. Best of luck.\n\nEdit: grammar", "I'm not sure I can necessarily vote on this one because I can see it both ways\n\nOn one hand, it sounds like a wonderful lovely tradition that they have. Sounds like this boy is close to his father. You could have just gotten up and slept on the couch for that night or something. Even put a pillow and some blankets on the floor. Instead you chose to wake him up and interrupt his time with his father and argue about it which just makes it look like you feel like you are superior to his own son and you barely even met him. His son absolutely 100% feels like you just walked in and took over and has now forced his father to choose you over him so of course he's going to be pissed off\n\nOn the other hand, that does sound like a pretty uncomfortable situation. I would not feel comfortable having a teenage boy in bed with me and my boyfriend. Even though obviously nothing would happen I would feel very dirty about it. So your logic probably told you that having him go back to his bed with the best solution and I do not believe that you did it to be mean. The three of you sleeping in the bed was definitely weird.\n\nperhaps in the future of this can be moved to the couch? Or you guys can preset so that you have a place to sleep? Something. But I think you may need to talk to the son and let him know that you're not trying to get rid of him and steal his father because whether you agree or not, that is exactly how it came out", "NAH\n\nIt's OK for him to want his moments with his dad, it's OK for you to not want to share a bed with a teenager. \n\nBut now you're dealing with a teenager with hurt feelings, and as the adults, it's up to you to help him through it.   \n\n\nIs there a solution? Can there be an apology for not understanding this is what they do? In the future if that's their thing, maybe on that night you're not staying over OR he's made to understand his dad still loves him but he's now too old to be sleeping in the bed with dad and his girlfriend.   \n\n\nGood luck. Hope you guys work it out.", "YTA. That was messed up. So kid fell asleep in bed with dad, what the actual fuck is wrong with that!? Quit being weird. And In a 2 month relationship? Mind your place lady. And telling bf what to do with his kid to fit your comfort isn't it.", "You've been in this relationship two months and you're already telling this kid what he can and can't do? Jeez, I'm not surprised he isn't a big fan of you. \n\nIt's not your house, not your bed and most importantly not your kid. Slow your role. \n\nDid you ever consider that maybe you could have slept somewhere else if you were uncomfortable?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You don't live there. So you should've been the one to move.", "NAH.  You and boyfriend need to talk about boundaries if he blamed you for his being forced to go to bed.\n\nThe decision ultimately wasn't yours.\n\nIf his dad and him need snuggle time, dad should make an effort to do some activities that promote snuggles.\n\nTeens get mad at their parents for a lot of reasons.", "NTA.  13 year old boy still needs to sleep with daddy after watching scary movie.
