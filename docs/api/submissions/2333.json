It's awful they're doing that.", "NTA\n\nYou grew up near the res, you understand how bad the internal politicking can be. I'm assuming the new council members have been harboring a grudge for a while. I grew up near a couple reservations and they were famous for the revolving door of government issued workers.

That's carrying a nasty stench of a very specific type of White Person Entitlement in the air.\n\nNOTE from history: Over the years, many, many Native tribes decided to disenfranchise / dis-enroll their black members mainly due to racism, partially due to greed (on the part of tribes that had serious casino action going on, or those with valuable land issues).

Also tribes have the right to kick who every they want to. It will just cause a lot of trouble for the tribe. Also op will be seen as using WWT", "The letter to the council seems like a good idea, maybe thank them for all the years of security they gave you. Mention that you would like to pay it back thru your social work. Maybe say that if they need anything that they may contact you. Just because they are being shitty does mot mean that you should be shitty. Good luck to you.", "I don't think you have much of a legal case. You are not native so your being on their land is up to them and they decided you were no longer welcome.  Do you know why they don't want you there anymore?", "Just focus on setting up a life you could be happy with right now. Start networking and meeting new people. We have to remember, the reservation is it\u2019s own Sovereignty and our laws do not necessarily reflect theirs. They have the authority to do it. Is it right? It doesn\u2019t sound so, but again, life is dealing you a hard ball right now. Keep learning and bettering yourself.", "First off, I think going a legal route will burn bridges with people that you don't want burnt but you are NTA for feeling the way you do.\n\nSecondly, whether or not you're allowed back in the future, your family and friends will still be your family and friends even if you have to meet outside. It's still heartbreaking that you can't live within your community but unless I'm missing something about who they're allowed to even be in contact with or how they can come and go within and out the reservation, you haven't lost them. You guys will  just need to adapt, hopefully temporarily, to the situation. I know this is all scary, and again, I'm really sorry if I'm just not understanding something, but while they can decided whether you can come on that specific space of land, they don't get to determine who is your family. You do and the people who cared for you do. You were part of that family when you went away to college, you're still part of it now even if you can't live in their community, which again, I hope is temporary. Best of luck to you and your family.", "I didn't mean as a kid, I meant as you came back as an adult social worker what values have you visibly supported that the rez leaders may not agree with? Because that would count for a lot. My rez took over our own social services also because  a lot of members did not like having white social workers determine situations for our youth. So a big part of it might be your new job lol Maybe they saw views you held on your social media? Who knows, you would have to tell me what those views are and even then it really depends on the values the rez leaders hold, they may just think the opposite of what you do about world events and do not want you there for that reason. \n\nAlso, aside from your adopted family, many of the members may not like seeing a white person living on the rez so they pressure the Chief and council to get rid of you. Could be a few different reasons, hard to tell unless I knew what band it was.", "You'd be better off asking the community to talk with these new members, then.", "I don't want to get into the why of new tribal council's thoughts on the matter, but basically they're of the mindset that non aboriginals are not welcome on reserve land anymore. I am technically not", "I'm sorry to hear that.", "Idk how it works where you are, but where I live my band votes on our council. That means that while legally you have no leg to stand on, without looking like a bad person, the people who love you and are band members have the ability to push for you to be allowed back. I do wonder though, if maybe something happened that they just haven\u2019t shared with you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this.", "Legal action will alienate you from the community in general. White woman using the legal system to strong arm a historically disenfranchised group does not look good.", "Because he's threatening legal action to a native community because of hurt feelings. Sorry, but that's an AH move. I agree, the new elders on the reservation are treating him horribly and it isn't kind or fair, but it isn't a situation he can really fight but as soon as he starts getting lawyers and making it a legal fight, he's taking it too far and becoming an AH.\n\nIt sounds like he still has friends on the reservation, just isn't welcome onsite anymore, sucks but he needs to find a way to maintain relationships with them and move on in a healthy way.", "It seems like you don't have a lot of personal recourse (aside from writing the elders/community an open letter about how much you want to serve the community that has always been your home), but your adopted family and friends could be your advocates to the elders and community. \n\nI wonder if it would help to figure out what resources you use that are tribal (i.e. not intended to support non-tribal members) and what resources you might have access to as a white person that you could bring into the community. If the elders see you as a drain on the community, it might be useful to be able to advocate for yourself in that way.", "It was my home for over 10 years and I lived there permanently with my non legally adoptive family. It's my home", "And you picked the profession of professional baby snatchers and life ruiners?", "They get let off the hook for racism all the time.", "At some point there\u2019s gotta be a statute of limitations on this guilt bs", "I wasn't actually legally adopted.  When my dad started drinking heavily, I would wander over to their house and stay for days or weeks at a time.  When I turned 13, I just never went back to my bio parents again.  There was no paperwork or anything.  My bio parents never tried to get me back and I just lived with my new family until I went to college", "OP mentioned that it's not an official or legal adoption, so they likely don't have many options", "Thank goodness someone made this point. This right here \ud83d\udc4c", "Even if we grew up together?", "But her family wants her there. It is immoral to deny her entrance, as it would be to deport an immigrant person who was raised by parents of their immigrant country.\n\nIf someone was raised by a nigerian family, and the nigerian government decided to deport them, it would be immoral.", "The reason I wanted to get legal involved is because 2 people alone should not be able to decide the will of an entire community when it's a vote.  I was told the 4 council members voted on issues (they were elected, yes), but I know nearly everyone there and no one said they had an issue with me being here.  I pretty much babysat all their kids when I was living there, everyone knew me when I walked down the street, I was very close to all of the elders for an assortment of reasons.  I just want to go home. I don't want land, or anything.  My grandmother isn't well, I want to go home.", "You're right.  This all just happened a few days ago.  The council made the vote, but maybe the community can advocate for me? I've never felt unwelcome by anyone there.  I don't think they unanimously voted me out", "Good advice.  Thank you", "I was told that anyone who is not part of their tribe was being evicted.  A Cree woman was also asked to leave and she's married to a man who lives there", "Ahh, this happened recently on my rez too. New chief elected so he has been purging the rez of white and non-band member employees and they have been let go in the past months.", "Given the legalities of this are way outside of my realm of knowledge I am unfit to judge you in this situation.", "I'm going to drop the legal council.  But I don't want to stop trying to get my home back.  I'm going to try and get the community on my side and see if they can't sway council, instead.  Everyone here has been really helpful in helping me my options.  I just want to go home.  My heart and soul are on this land and I feel complete here", "It's racist. Let a subdivision refuse to allow a member of the native community to live there and there would (rightfully) be hell to pay but it's okay for the native community to discriminate? And don't say they are victims, that's not a good excuse in of itself since even Native Americans understood the concept of right of conquest.", "It's land your people shoved Indigenous people into when they stole the rest of the land. They were meant to be camps where those Nations would die out. It's not your home. You're a settler who is trying to steal the little tiny bit if land that remains. \n\nI know you don't think of yourself as such. I know you're traumatized from your childhood. But you're a settler and the sooner you accept that, the sooner you can find a path forward.", "Today's society if you're having your child taken away from you. Chances are you deserve it.", "When the mistreatment stops and amends are made? But people like you exist who ask ignorant questions like why they have more of a right to their land than the OP. There are people who are still alive that remember being forcibly taken from their homes and sent to live with \"Christian\" families, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their songs or gather to perform their ceremonies. There are languages that only have 4 speakers because the generations that came after them weren't allowed to learn how to speak their own language. Statute of limitations can't really expire while the mistreatment continues.", "You should see if you can be legally adopted as an adult by your adopted family.", "So is the tribal council like an HOA who can make rules for what people do with their property? This couple aren't allowed to let you live in their home?", "[deleted]", "Yes. Especially. You grew up there but clearly have no understanding of the systemic issues at play. That makes you dangerous.", "So clearly you\u2019re missing something about the way that the American legal system works when dealing with tribes. Tribes have sovereignty, meaning they have the right to autonomous governance, including their own constitutions, legal systems, courts, etc. If you have been banished from tribal land, you have no legal recourse. An American lawyer would get you nowhere. The only time that those lines are blurred are in instances of capital murder. Unless you were murdered and are posting this from beyond, there isn\u2019t a darn thing you can do. YWBTA for pushing this", "Wait she\u2019s married to a member and they asked her to leave!?", "This is exactly what happened here", "May I ask your personal thoughts on this issue?  Were you for the measure?  Am I being unreasonable to try and stay if it's the only home I've ever known?", "How does this tribal government work? It sounds like OP was living with a couple who lives on the reservation, but then OP was forcibly removed. Do reservation residents not own their houses and have the freedom to invite who they want to them?", "I am sorry. I have to ask. Are you not even able to see your adoptive parents anymore in their own house? That they can\u2019t even have you over a guest anymore?", "I suggest asking a lawyer if an adoption would change things, but that\u2019s it.", "Going to point out that saying \"But I don't want to stop **trying to get back home**\" reads a lot better than \"But I don't want to stop **trying to get my home back**\" as a white person talking about living on a reservation. That is not your home. Get what I'm saying? Monitor yourself for signs of entitlement. Do some real soul searching on how you perceive your rights to be on that land and why you perceive them so. Words matter, pay attention to why you chose the ones you chose.   \n\n\nYou don't seem to understand some pretty big issues with ever even considering trying to use the US government to force yourself onto Native land. I am very confused as to how you could live in the community and not have learned enough to have never even considered it. It is something an outsider would consider.", "My eyes rolled back so far I saw down my fucking throat.", "The son of the arsonists must buy me a new home then", "That's a very interesting prospect, actually!  I'll bring it up", "Did you miss the part where he said his adoptive family is upset as well?  Do they not get a say as well?", "Are you serious right now? Op literally just wants to be around their family.\n\nI'll give you the benift of the doubt because you sound like a younger teenager, but you are 100% wrong. Op is not being malicious in wanting to enter the reserve to see their FAMILY, whether they are blood related or not, those people are their family.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm not American so I don't know how these reserves work so do take my opinion on it with a grain of salt, but I think if someone has a connection to someone within the reserve (to a reasonable degree, say in Ops case a makeshift family) they should be able to see said person.", "You can say she would not be able to do anything, but why would she be the ASSHOLE? Her family lives there.", "Yup.", "I'm surprised he wasn't as well. \"Marry out, stay out\" is still general practice on quite a few FN reserves.", "Ahh I knew it wasn't my rez you were talking about because you said 2 councillors is 50% of the vote lol my rez has 10 councillors", "hmm I have a few different answers rolled in one lol\n\n\\- Was I for the measure? Yes, the people let go weren't necessary positions/specific skills that our band needed that didn't have within our our own ranks.\n\n\\- I don't blame you for your feelings and feel bad for your lack of family, maybe rent close to the rez so they can visit you? But I do think its unreasonable you would try to force the issue because we're pretty protective over the land we have left and a white person trying to force their perceived rights to be on our land will never go well. I don't have any problems with white people and like most that I have known to some degree. But ultimately I  stand with the natives who want to protect our land and our borders and that refuse anyone who feels entitled to be there that doesn't have the membership right to be.", "I honestly don't know yet.  It happened a few days ago and I haven't tried to go back yet.  I'm really just processing it all and staying at a hotel in the nearest town for now.", "That\u2019s what it sounds like to me. If families living on the reservation are unable to see or allow guests that seems extreme and I would say NTA for trying to get back (hopefully without lawyers)", "Sorry you're racist then.", "Go the traditional adoption route.", "I feel for you about being left out from the community you have known so long. But taking a legal recourse is not going to make them really accept you as one of them.\n\nYou can keep in touch with your adoptive family and keep lines of communication open with the council as much as possible. That way, you get to discuss your views with them in future. Taking legal action alienates you from them, the very people you want to hopefully live with. Hope you understand the fine distinction.\n\nNTA", "I really think it is a good idea actually. Taking legal actions is not the solution but being legally adopted by the family that become your refuge since childhood will be very good for you and for your rights to see them. Talk to them about this.", "Did you miss the part where OP wasn't adopted?", "Lmao...I don't need your benefit of doubt and I do know how these things work. Op has a family, albeit one they don't like. This person is grown and knows how tribal council works. Great just start suing your way into native land. And op CAN see and visit... Just NOT LIVE ON TRIBAL LAND", "I sympathize with OP, I really do. I know that this likely was not due to any fault of their own. But they WBTA for wasting everyone\u2019s time and resources, including their own, for a fight they can\u2019t possibly win. They can try to have a proxy plead their case in front of tribal council, but suing a tribe for making decisions that they have every legal right to make would make them the AH.", "Yikes", "He left with her.  He was given the choice, though", "Do you believe a goverment should be allowed to cut families apart?

Context matters. Not saying OP deserves to be discriminated against, but the history of power imbalance between white and indigenous folks in North America is heavily skewed.", "It\u2019s still reasonable to ask why they can\u2019t have whoever they want in their own home.", "Your point?!  Does not being adopted diminish the feelings that his not bio family has for him?\u2019", "Heck, suing anyone for a decision they had a legal right to make would make them an AH.", "So that means you have racial double-standards.", "Visit is fine", "They can visit but not live on the rez.", "Not according to OP."]}
