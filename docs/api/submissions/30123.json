You should be paying for yourselves - you and your fiance's expenses because you want to be financially independent. That also means that BIL is not YOUR dependent. I think you should have a talk with your fiance and he should broach the subject with his parents. If they want to still finance his brother, that is fine, but it isn't going to be you two that are taking part of that.", "Take your own vacations.  Do not tell anyone until you are there so they cannot invite themselves. \n\nTurn down their invites.....no vacation time, busy time at job....vague reasons.\n\nIn Laws will get the message. You won't feel used.", "NTA. If they wanna coddle him they pay the difference. If you and your spouse go out to dinner with another couple and they bring their minor child, for instance, you don't expect the kid to pay, but you also expect the other couple to cover 3 out of the 5 meals.", "NTA. Now that you are getting married to your fianc\u00e9, he needs to make some changes and stop being a pushover.

Your future in-laws (including BIL) should be embarrassed to even ask. Your FBIL is a fully grown, fully capable adult. Asking other adults to pay for anything, particularly his vacations, is absurd. \n\nWhy should you, a 28 year old, be financially responsible for a 29 year old? That doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Soooooo NTA. It's ridiculous that they would even suggest that", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to cover the BIL expenses. If the parents want to spoil him, then that is on them. Not your circus not your monkeys.", "NTA you shouldn't need to support your in laws decisions financially. Your fianc\u00e9 better be on board though because this is how your in laws show love and care - the discussion can easily devolve into one where they think you're criticising their parenting methods", "~~INFO:~~  You've left out an important detail here---what is your fiance's opinion about this? \n\nYou are correct that the \"math\" isn't fair here.  But that's not the only consideration with a situation like this, especially when there is both financial history with these siblings *and* future relationship harmony with your in-laws.\n\nNTA based on OP's response below.", "NTA.  Your in-laws apparently have no problem using not only their money, but yours, to finance their son's lifestyle.  His finances are not your problem. Pay only for yourself.", "NTA. Why in the world would you pitch in to cover your BIL's expenses. To me, it's not awkward at all. \"We're saving for a wedding and won't be able to cover any of BIL's portion of the bill. He'll need to pay his share.\" \n\nYou really don't even have to give a why (saving for the wedding). This is so ridiculous.", "INFO: his parents seem well off, why wouldn\u2019t they just cover the entire cost of the vacation rental? They were fine paying your fianc\u00e9\u2019s bills until he told them to stop? As far as letting them pay his bills, some wealthier families do this kind of stuff as a form of estate planning.  Giving their children part of their inheritance early.", "NTA\n\nThe in-laws mindset is odd.

If they want to pay for him, they can.", "NTA- and I would be very explicit so there is no misunderstanding.  I will not be covering BIL portion of anything, ever. He can pay, you can pay, I'm not paying. I am not responsible for him or his decisions and I'm not paying for him.", "NTA.  You may have some work cut out for you to bring your fianc\u00e9 around to your point of view. If your future parents-in-law want to subsidize their son, they should be free to do so - but they shouldn't pass that expectation on to you, as well.  \n\nOf course, you could always set aside a bit of that \"don't accept money from them\" and just accept enough over the course of a year to cover what they expect you to pay for holidays ;)", "NTA you do not have to pay for him he is a grown ass adult!", "NTA.

It is you and your fianc\u00e9s choice to pay only for yourselves.  Why would anyone pay all the time for a capable adult who can do so themselves?   They are setting their child up for failure.  I hope they have plans in place if something happens to them because BiL will be clueless.", "Thank you for this. I do really appreciate that this is their love language and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being intentionally unreasonable at all. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll consider in my approach to any future instances", "Good point - he\u2019s supportive of what I think and agrees that we shouldn\u2019t cover BIL. IMO he still struggles to speak out against his parents (thankfully this isn\u2019t required a lot). They\u2019ve made him feel guilty in the past about him being bad with money as a young adult. He generally leaves it right until the last moment to say anything and this stresses me out so on this occasion I came straight out with it right off the bat", "NTA on the exact question about your share of the expense. Maybe the time has come for less-frequent group vacations.\n\nSounds like the parents were fine providing financial support to both siblings in their single lives.  Families who are financially very comfortable often have this approach. \n\nNow that you and your fiance are an almost-married couple, his parents have apparently moved you into the \"independent\" category. *Not mathematically fair* but it probably makes sense to them. They shouldn't be offended that you think otherwise though.", "Thank you for offering an alternative way to look at it and I definitely take it on board!"]}
