The medical profession is  stressful no matter what, so does that mean he has to stop his lifelong hobby because of it? \n\nMy wife's a nurse and is stressed about work stuff, but that doesn't mean she wants me to stop fishing alone. Even though me being alone miles back in the mountains stresses her out. Especially when I would be in grizzly Country. But She would never ever be like \"hey work is really stressful, can you not do something you love?\" No way, she encourages me to go.", "I'd say there's something wrong with it when they use it to prevent a loved one from doing something they love. Especially when it's something they don't like them doing to begin with, that just makes it seem like like an excuse to get their way. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "She doesn't need help, that's the point. She wants him there but she does not need him. \n\nShe can be happy for him that he's going to have a good time or make him stay and be the AH.", "I think the part of this I'm having trouble with is: \"She needs him\", she doesn't need him, she wants him there. She does not need him there.", "She doesn't need it.", "The trip was the first choice, it was planned weeks before this lol and it seems like she's invited, just doesn't want to go. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Having people around can help, sure. Going to actual therapy does a lot more though, and doesn't end with those people resenting you for putting the load of your mental health on them.", "Yeah but they don\u2019t try to hold eachother hostage either. Her not liking flying doesn\u2019t mean he has to stop", "And then she does that with the next trip, and the one after that, and just uses it to get her way and give up this hobby. \n\nAgreed, but this isn't a dire life or death situation, this is a situation that's just been put on hold. If you force a partner to give up their hobby, or not go on a trip, or whatever just because you're stressed you'll never leave the house again lol", "Then this has nothing to do with the husband. But he states this has to do with a loan and a practice. He can\u2019t help the outcome of the bank giving a loan or not. She maybe be depressed with how her like is going not husband.", "We have no way of knowing how much wife truly fears OP\u2019s hobby. Maybe it\u2019s a totally irrational fear however that\u2019s how she feels. It\u2019s really not unreasonable for partners to request help when they are overly stressed. Most partners will try to help alleviate their partner stress, not add to it. \n\nIf OP\u2019s wife has had no previous issues with them flying then it would be a strange request however if this has been an ongoing issue then they should understand why this just isn\u2019t the best timing to add more stress.", "Wtf does that mean? She's depressed, going through a hard time and requested that he stays with her. What more does she need to do to show that she needs help? She absolutely needs help and anyone with an emotional capacity above that of a spoon can see it", "It honestly doesn\u2019t matter if she needs him or wants him. We also don\u2019t know what her mental state is to know if she needs him or want him. \n\nNeither of which will stop her from being upset that he is going. So it\u2019s up to him to decide. Honestly I would pack and leave him if he goes. If I clearly tell my so I would really appreciate it if he stay with me so I can feel better and he goes naw you are fine I am going with the boys. My response will be that\u2019s fine I will find someone else who cares about me instead.", "*when they think they need it. Fixed it.\n\nObviously if it's a consistently repeated behaviour it's unhealthy.\n\nBut if my partner says they need something from me, they get it. I don't debate whether they need it.", "OP said she\u2019s only been like this recently so not enough time to get into therapy and it to have an impact yet. Yeah therapy is great for long term but she\u2019s depressed *now* and wants her husband to be with her for support.", "This is not a situation that will solve itself over night so she is going to be faced with these troubles for a little while, he cannot put his life on hold to be there for the duration. He's not leaving her alone to deal with it for a prolonged period of time, it's 4 days!", "But this is not a quick thing she's going through, she could be facing this issue for months. If it was a short term thing I'd agree with you but I just can't help but feel he can't put his life on hold for months just to be close by phsycially? Where do you draw the line? I'd say at a preplanned, short term trip, personally. I guess we just disagree.", "I would agree with you 100% if she was going through something immediately; an illness, a death in the family, being fired etc. She's not though, this situation could last for months. He has a short term, preplanned trip, I just cannot see the problem", "OP doesn't say \"recently\", they say \"lately\". People usually don't randomly start being depressed for the first time in their 30s. And husband can give her support over the phone for a few days. Why does her mental health take priority over his?", "Yeah, expecting him to put his life on hold until a bank figures out what they're going to do is kinda toxic. Misery loves company though. \n\nBesides, if she is depressed and he stays home he will also be depressed. Then instead of being able to comfort and support her they will both be miserable. I'm not saying op would intentionally not be supportive. However it's hard to cheer someone up when you're also upset.", "Yeah, sure. People who think this way then act all surprised when they come back after leaving a supposedly loved partner/relative heavily depressed and in a shitty situation for days and find out that person ended up in even worse state or, in extreme cases, committed suicide. But who cares, right? It's just a few days alone, afraid and sad. What could possibly go wrong?", "She's not asking him to put his life on hold for months. She's asking him to put her first, this one time, after getting bad news that has effectively ended a dream of hers she's been working towards for a long time. Yes, if she's rational she knows he can't fix it in one night. But having him there that FIRST night will make a world of difference in her feeling supported, loved, and able to face what comes after. \n\nIf my SO asked me to do this, I'd be canceling plans in a heartbeat. I say that as someone who'll be heavily pregnant for an upcoming family event that I am practically shoving him out the door to attend (wedding of another family member) because just because I have to miss out for practical reasons doesn't mean he should! \n\nThis is what you do in a mature relationship.", "I thought I was going insane with these comments! Thank you!", "You cannot live your life in this way, afraid to do anything incase someone kills themselves. Wise up. That would not a marriage it would be a carer.", "My bf tells me all the time to go do things when I have the chance because he knows we both need a break. We're parents and if one has a chance to go out with friends we support the other. \n\nI think a lot of people think couples need to sort EVERYTHING out together. However that is very draining and unintentionally toxic. \nBest thing is fire everyone to breathe, think, and then regroup to assess the situation with a clear mind.", "Marriage means taking care of the other when they need help. If you don't want to do it, why marry someone?", "Marriage is also a two way street and they will be dealing with this situation for a long time, there will be sacrifices they both have to make."]}
