That doesn't mean they don't go flying at all, though. \nMaybe long trips aren't always within his schedule, I wonder if he could try to reschedule it, but then maybe there isn't the time to considering they were to leave soon.\n\nThere is too much assuming to actually make a judgement on it really.", "We can say NTA or YTA all day but bottom line is it\u2019s your marriage and your wife.. what is this trip going to do once you return.. It does seem either her be sad that your going or you and your buddy be sad if you don\u2019t.. you know what is a deal breaker and what going will do to the relationship.. \n\nShe\u2019s not having an emergency maybe feels sad and wants support..  but you also want to enjoy long weekend.. \n\nBut it\u2019s you and your wife in this marriage not your buddy and all of us internet people.. it\u2019s all in how you want it to affect life once you return home..", "Gentle YTA. I understand wanting to go so badly, truly I do. But your wife has already been depressed and literally was just told her actual dream may never come true. This is the type of situation that ends lives and you're not even registering that. If I received soul crushing news and the very next day my husband wanted to leave for almost a week (regardless of what he was doing, but if he was doing something that would further deplete my mental health it would be even worse) I'd be seriously questioning who I married. And if your friend cannot understand that your WIFE genuinely needs you, why would you even want to be friends with him?", "YTA in my opinion for one detail which you included but everyone seems to be ignoring. You said she was already \u201cdepressed\u201d and this is one more thing on top. If she is depressed, not sad, not upset, depressed then she needs your support. She is your wife, your life partner and she should be able to depend on you to put her first, even if it\u2019s inconvenient for your plans.", "YTA just for leaving without her let alone when she's not ok\n\nYou could've go somewhere together for a trip.", "YTA.

I'm curious,  since she's so busy and career driven, how often has she dropped her work plans to be supportive of you?", "NTA, you can't do anything, you don't have regular vacations and your wife sounds annoyed for possibly making passive aggressive comments about going on the trip, many will say you should stay but no one sees that you don't do things like this and you shouldn't always sacrifice your happiness for your wife, you also need to enjoy", "Nta. It's an ah move on her part to manipulate and guilt trip you because she's having a hard time. How ridiculous and I'd say it's extremely unkind to use someone's love for you to try to manipulate them into not doing something they're very excited about doing. What does she expect from you? To stay behind and listen to her whine and watch her sulk? Does she just want you to be be miserable with her?", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nThis is bad news. It\u2019s rough. It\u2019s also not something like the loss of a loved one or a medical issue. \n\nTell her to order her favourite takeout and watch a comfort movie and you\u2019ll make sure to call her each day.", "NTA\n\nMisery loves company.", "NTA. It would be different if she were going through some kind of health emergency, or you were leaving her alone with kids. But this seems like fairly normal - albeit stressful - life stuff.", "I'm going with NAH.  Your desire to go on the trip is valid: you've been planning it for weeks, looking forward to it the entire time, and you haven't been on a trip like this is a couple of years from the sound of things.\n\nYour wife's feelings are valid: she's dealing with a lot of stress, what might or might not be an episode of clinical depression, and found out she may not be able to achieve one of her major goals.\n\nI say go on your trip, and suggest she take a couple of days for herself, maybe stay at a nice hotel in your area, have a spa day, do some things she wants to do to relax and take her mind off things.", "NTA", "Not being able to own her own practice is not a tragedy. It's a setback. In this economy, it might be a blessing, not one she appreciates, and I'm sure she's devastated. \n\nYou get a chance for a trip like this only every 2-4 years? Take it, she's mad about losing a business opportunity, there isn't anything you can do to make it better and I assume she'll be working since you said she couldn't take the time herself. \nSo why stay home if she'll be working?", "NTA but if you knew you would be out of town you could\u2019ve brought a friend or family member around to keep her company / support.", "NTA\n\nI've had a lot of crap dumped on me the last 5-6 months, health wise and work wise. I already suffer from MDD and anxiety so all the new crap made it worse. \n\nI would still never expect my mom (who I live with) to stay home with me from her plans with her friends. Be that a lunch date (retirees) or all day away quilting (when I can't join her). All she'd be able to do is listen to me complain and melt into the couch, which just makes HER depressed watching me. \n\nWhat your wife is going through is rough and maybe she is feeling a bit touchy but it isn't fair to expect you to drop a long made plan to do what? Sit and listen to her complain? You can't fix the situation for her, as much as you might want to. She's just gotta ride it out.", "My only issue here is that you say your wife has been depressed. That can be unsettling for people who don\u2019t live with it all the time, and you leaving could be detrimental. Rather that just making a decision on your own, sit down with her and talk about why she wants you to stay, what that would accomplish, and what would need to happen for you to go. Does she simply need support, or is she in a bad place and doesn\u2019t want to be alone? It seems like you need to have a productive conversation about who needs what right now, and what going vs. staying will accomplish for both of you. These decisions are always better if you make them together and there will be less resentment if you are on the same page before leaving/staying.", "There must be an anonymous forum here on Reddit where she can find other doctors or vets in like minded quandaries for some solace aside from you. It\u2019s hard to feel this depended upon when you are offered a rare 4 days to get away. You need your needs met also.  How long has this conflict with her work been brewing?  I think it\u2019s a reasonable request. Good luck.", "NTA.  She's a doctor and has \"a demanding work schedule\".  As such, I'm assuming she is on call.  Yes or no?", "NTA, you gotta live your life. Wife is being ridiculous. Why does it matter if you're there or not? Kids? What's the logic?", "NTA...your wife is going through a difficult time yes...but when will this difficult time end? My guess will be years from now...the stress of strarting her own practice, finding and retaining, building relations with qualified staff, same for client base, and keeping up on ever changing rules and education she will need is probably not gping to go away for many years. Ball park off the top of my head, id say 10 years if she is successful before she doesnt feel an excessive amount of  stress fron this venture...so what are you supposed to do, never go on a trip, forgo your passions to support her? No!   This is life stress...it will always be present to some degree..its not the type of stress that stops your loved ones from their lives to support her for like if she had a misscairage or death of a close loved one...go enjoy ypur trip..the loan stress will be therr waiting when you get back either way.  I suggest she also find time for a vaction as well", "NTA. But maybe schedule something to pamper her while you\u2019re gone so she knows you\u2019re thinking about her? Facial, massage, girls movie night, etc. Personally, I like have a few days to myself every once in a while, where I can read, not cook, clean up after only me. Maybe try talking about things in that way instead of you leaving.", "Is your wife 5?  NTA. Go on your trip. Your wife is being a controlling and manipulative and she's acting like a child.", "NTA. Sure you\u2019re going to feel bad. It\u2019s your wife. It\u2019s natural. That said there\u2019s nothing much you can do.

Enjoy your trip and encourage her to enjoy some reset alone time. You both deserve it.", "Nta. But I want to say, neither is she. Depression can make things feel bigger than they are. And she didn\u2019t tell you not to go, just expressed her disappointment that you are leaving at this time. That is ok. It doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go, just maybe check in with her in the evenings, if you can, to let her know you are safe.
