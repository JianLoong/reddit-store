But you said you started planning this trip weeks ago, which sounds like it was still during a time your wife was struggling. You could possibly have planned for a better time, though I don\u2019t know your schedule.\n\nThink about it from your wife\u2019s perspective. She\u2019s constantly busy and working all the time. She had a dream which she has been working extremely hard to turn into a reality and has just had that dream crushed, if not forever than at least for a very long time. She\u2019s been depressed. She\u2019s tired. And now her partner is leaving on a trip where he will be doing something she is terrified of.\n\nThat being said, the way she\u2019s guilting you about it isn\u2019t an effective way to communicate these feelings. It\u2019s not behavior that is conducive to getting what you want.\n\nYou\u2019re both a little lacking in empathy for one another right now and a little too focused on yourselves. That happens in relationships sometimes. You can\u2019t ALWAYS put the other person first.\n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH. But you guys need to work on communicating effectively if you want the relationship to thrive.\n\nDoes she have family or friends that could come stay with her while you\u2019re gone so she\u2019s not alone? Are you able to text/talk daily so she doesn\u2019t worry as much? Is there anything you can do before you go to ease some of the burden she\u2019s carrying (clean the house, cook meals she can eat as leftovers, etc.). Is there something you need from her so that you don\u2019t feel terrible the whole trip?\n\nTalk it out. Try to both come into it with open minds, honesty, empathy, and good listening. Don\u2019t cancel your trip because you are looking forward to it and it sounds like you need it. But maybe find a way to set things up to ease her mind a bit.\n\nI hope you guys work it out!", "NTA. Life is unpredictable, and sometimes things come at bad times. A few years ago we had to move suddenly and my boyfriend had already had a river trip to Kentucky planned (we live in Colorado) with his friends. Right at the same time, I was having back problems and was in a lot of pain and could hardly lift or move anything. Did I ask him to cancel his trip just to help move a few boxes and furniture? No, I enlisted help from my other support system, my friends and family. Go on your trip, your wife will be fine.", "Wife is a clear asshole and wants you to be miserable with her. \n\nRefuse, go on the trip, and explain that you can't help her if she makes you feel miserable.", "NTA but do something for her.

While she can't \"get away\" like you can at this moment, she can do other things that bring her peace and joy. Make a list of stuff she could try, give her a gift basket of her favorite things, spend one-on-one time with her before you go and after you come back.

Then encourage her. Tell her to go on you tube and look up Jim Rohn. He will get her seeing a vision on how to go about her goals. Tell he where there is a will there is a way. Tell her that just because someone says no ( like the  bank) that doesn't mean never. Banks aren't the only way of going about things. Does she have any sort of networking system? Can she buy some stuff then rent the other equipment? Tell her to really look outside the box. I is good for her to have these days with you out of her hair. Tell her to resurch how some doctors got their practices going. There even might be people willing to invest or just donate to the cause. Maybe she can do something like a sliding scale for non insurance. People love to donate to that. She's got this. She needs to brainstorm.  Maybe also reach out to some old perfessors from school to get some suggestions.  Tell her to read the book \"Mountains beyond Mountains \" This doctor was broken and did the extraordinary.", "NTA. Would be N A H but I don\u2019t like that she\u2019s making you feel guilty about it. You\u2019ve been planning it for a while, it\u2019s basically just a long weekend, and you don\u2019t do things like this without her very often so it\u2019s really just unfortunate timing. As long as you\u2019re not leaving out some big tragic thing that explains why she\u2019s been depressed lately, as people sometimes do here. \n\nIs it too late to see if some of her friends want to get together while you\u2019re gone for a few fun things this weekend to take her mind off it all? Dinner somewhere nice, wine night, yoga class, movie, brunch, something she enjoys but maybe hasn\u2019t done in a while? I know how tempting and comfortable it is to wallow when you\u2019re depressed. I love myself a good wallow.

They're your friends and it doesn't sound like you spend a ton of time away from her, which is key here. Your wife isn't the only important person in your life and you're allowed to do things that don't revolve around her from time to time.\n\nI wish I would have said this to myself a long time ago, it would have saved a lot of issues in my own marriage and grief for my husband - she's a big girl who can handle her troubles alone sometimes, if it means you get to go have fun for 4 days. You're both still individuals.", "Pardon me for not feeling sympathy towards a DOCTOR who can\u2019t open her own practice.

Who lord's over a vacation because a friend's spouse is having an emotional crisis? \"If you take care of your wife than having fun with me then you can't be my friend anymore!\" What a turd. \n\nIf it were my spouse I would stay with him because it would mean a lot. If that happened to me, and I asked him to stay - I would hope he would support me too. \n\nMarriage is about compromise. Life can seem unfair, but a vacation is just a vacation. Your spouse is someone you agreed to help through thick and thin supposedly for the rest of your life. She's asking for help.

You\u2019ve KNOWN this was a difficult time, and you\u2019ve planned to go on a flying trip which you know she finds incredibly anxiety inducing and stressful. Some seasons of life are more difficult that others, and part of being in a partnership means that sometimes you have to give more than the other person. This is one of those times.", "Yeah I think whether or not he\u2019s an asshole is besides the point. It doesn\u2019t matter if we think he\u2019s in the right or not, she\u2019s asking him to be with her to support her and going on the trip instead will obviously piss off his wife. Requests out of your partner aren\u2019t always rational and sometimes they\u2019re overreactions, but prioritizing this trip over being there for his wife will most likely blow up in OP\u2019s face.

Many depressed people don\u2019t even know they are depressed until they struggle for awhile. \n\nAnd I\u2019m well aware that we are both going off of what is being given us, but as someone with a whole family of doctors, friend circle of doctors, and who has a doctorate in healthcare myself, I can tell you from my own personal experience that being in this field absolutely has contributed to situational depression which over time morphed into clinical depression. Recognizing that my work situation was a contributing factor, I also strongly considered changing my career to private practice.
