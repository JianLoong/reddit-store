June and I were just chatting over a cup of tea when there was a scream from the kitchen and we rushed to find that Steven had tried to eat a whole macadamia nut with shell. For context the nut is a white nut surrounded by the hardest and most smooth chocolate looking shell you've ever seen. He'd obviously thought it was chocolate and tried to eaten it from a closed Tupperware Container on the kitchen island (Was going to cracking them with a hammer later).\nMy friend first admonished Steven for eating something obviously not meant for him and took him to emergency dental where she later learned he has cracked one of his molars and it was apparently quite bad. Apparently as its still his first set of teeth they will just be pulling it out but she wants me to pay for at least half as it was my macadamia and it was on the kitchen island and accessible. aita", "created_utc": 1704642526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190v0mj/aita_for_refusing_the_pay_for_dental_fees_after_a/", "score": 2541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That molar is gonna fall out anyway, and his adult teeth will grow in to replace it.", "NTA - How was this any way, shape, or form your fault? Her kid tried to eat something that in a closed container that wasn't meant for him (which she acknowledged) and *she* wasn't watching him. Some friend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>it was my macadamia and it was on the kitchen island and accessible.\n\nThat's absurd.", "Not the asshole. It was in a sealed container in someone else's house. If you'd handed him the nut and said \"here ya go champ, knock yourself out!\" things would've been different, but he literally went into somebody else's stuff and hurt himself doing it.   \n  Your friend was also THERE - so it's not like you were the one who should've been supervising the kid.   \n  This is on the mum, 100%.   \n  Her kid didn't have the manners not to go into your stuff (I would've been in SO much trouble if I did what he did, and yes I knew MUCH better than to do that at 8 years old, that's not too young to be aware of manners, and right & wrong).  \n  And then to add insult to injury she tries to get you to share the blame because the consequences are financially inconvenient, which is cheeky as hell.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure the cost is unexpected for her but this is entirely her child\u2019s fault. Would she hold you liable if he\u2019d tried to eat the kitchen counter? At what point is she responsible for overseeing her child? \n\n\u201cThank goodness he\u2019s young enough that he would have lost this tooth anyway. It\u2019s too bad that there will be an associated cost, but since I wasn\u2019t babysitting, I am not responsible and won\u2019t be contributing financially. I hope he had a speedy recovery.\u201d End of friendship? Maybe. But if so, that\u2019s on June.", "Counter-sue for the cost of the nut. Macadamias are brutally expensive right now.", "NTA \n\nThough they were at your home, a kid is still under his mother's responsibility. \n\nThe tupperware was closed, it is enough to say that it was not \"accessible\". The fact that he opened it just shows the kid's bad behaviour and the mother's carelessness. \n\nSorry for the kid, but opening boxes in people's home is quite never a good idea", "NTA. He ate something from a Tupperware that wasn't offered to him and cracked his own tooth. That's not on you.", "Your \"friend\" is being ridiculous. She let her kid run around your house unsupervised, didn't teach him manners (8 isn't too young to know you're not supposed to take stuff that isn't yours or specifically offered to you, regardless of how \"accessible\" it is) and now expects you to pay for the consequences? \n\nAsk her this: if he had broken a tooth biting into a nut that he stole in a supermarket, would she ask the supermarket to pay for it? Somehow I doubt it. \n\nNTA, your friend is. I hope you show her this post and the answers.", "I think we need to dig further in order to determine who is truly the responsible party.  If it were me, I\u2019d sue the farmer where the Macadamia nuts were harvested.", "She failed to supervise her child. Who did something he was old enough to know he shouldn't.\n\nNTA", "NTA- I don\u2019t understand how your friend is even wanting you to pay half.

The fact that\u2019s she trying to shift blame is concerning.  This is the kind of accident which sometimes happens with kids.  \n\nIf anything, this could be blamed on her for not supervising her kid properly. You\u2019re kind not to point that out.  \n\nShe\u2019s put you on notice that she will expect payment for accidents she and her kids cause. Combined with her lack of supervision, she\u2019s a liability if you have her in your home.   And if you go only to her home, lack of reciprocation becomes an issue.  Also, don\u2019t ever go near a pool or ocean or other hazard with her and her kid.", "NTA\n\nThe kid did something he wasn\u2019t supposed to, that\u2019s on bad parenting, not you.", "NTA.

Teach 'em not to eat random shit lying around.\n\n8yo is too old to randomly stuff things into your mouth.", "NTA. It's a parent's responsibility to look after their child, not everyone else's responsibility to make everything childproof. And 8 years old should be more than old enough to understand that you need to ask permission before taking someone else's food and eating it.", "NTA, he shouldn't have grabbed it without asking and the fact his mother blames you is ridiculous", "NTA. \u201cOn the kitchen island and accessible\u201d is she saying you\u2019re supposed to proof your house for an 8 year old for every possible scenario? \n\nThe lesson here is for Steven, it is don\u2019t take things that don\u2019t belong to you without permission. Not, you should have predicted my kid would try and eat your macadamia nuts. \n\nNonsense.", "NTA. He's 8yo, not a toddler that has to have the house arranged for him. And even if he was, he shouldn't be without supervision. At 8yo, anyone would've just asked \"can I have one of these?\".", "NTA. She left her child unsupervised. Her child helped himself to food not offered to him. \nNo friend would be asking for half of his dental costs.", "NTA NTA NTA\nHell nah lady that's her problem. I can't even bkame her kid because he is still a kid but she was supposed keep an eye on him .", "NTA. While it's unfortunate that Steven got hurt, you didn't intentionally cause the harm. The responsibility falls on the parent to ensure their child's safety, especially in someone else's home. Offering sympathy and support is reasonable, but expecting you to cover the dental fees seems unjust. It's an unfortunate accident, and your friend should understand that accidents can happen even with the best precautions.", "Nta. Remind her that it was her child who got into your property without permission which is stealing. If she had been a proper parent and taught her child to ask this wouldn't have happened.", "You were not responsible for watching the child. His mother was present.\n\nHe may have made much better choices in the past, but he is only 8 years old - still too young to be left alone. That\u2019s because the possibility of wrong choices is still there, and he needs his parents to help him learn.\n\nIt was unfortunate and I understand she has limited resources. However I would be a lot more comfortable with her saying she can\u2019t afford it and can you loan her the money to fix it. \n\nTrying to make it your responsibility makes me worry if you can afford the risk of having her in your home again. What else might become \u201cyour fault\u201c? What if you don\u2019t hide your purse or your car keys?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to jump to extremes - we will do that for you. Just be careful.\n\nNTA", "It was \"accessible\" in a closed container that he had no business opening. Even his mother admitted this when she admonished him. NTA and you are not responsible for his breaking a tooth.", "NTA\n\nIt was an accident. Per OP\u2019s comments, the kid usually asks before taking food at their house. Kid learned a the same valuable lesson cats learn about curiosity\u2026tho I suppose cats die learning it, and the kid will have adult teeth soon enough.", "Yeah NTA", "NTA he was unsupervised by his mother in your house and went into your kitchen, opened a shut container, helped himself to a nut and cracked his tooth. None of that was your fault it was his and his mothers fault.

If a child is getting into something they shouldn\u2019t be, it is not the homeowner\u2019s fault if something goes wrong! Plus he is 8 years old, he should definitely know to not just eat things that aren\u2019t his or offered to him. \n\nIf you had been babysitting, the situation would be different but his mother was there and not watching him-that is in no way your fault.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t be paying for that", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d needs to parent her child not try to get a free ride on your dime.", "I\u2019m flabbergasted that she would even ask.

You took reasonable precautions.  It\u2019s her responsibility to supervise him.\n\nThis kid doesn\u2019t respect boundaries and is too dumb not to stop biting down on something once he realizes it\u2019s hard.", "NTA - l wouldn\u2019t consider in a container \u201caccessible\u201d; there had to be a conscious effort to get to them, and nor did he ask permission (or what they were). Parent at fault for not supervising, or making sure the kid knows to ask before helping themselves to stuff.", "NTA. Steven is not your child and not your responsibility to monitor. You had the macadamia nuts stored in a container. He's a 3rd grader who should know better. Your former friend June  is a 39 year old mother who should know better than to ask.", "HAHAHAHA absolutely the fuck not.  Her child is her responsibility, and while we live in reality where there are going to be times kids aren't under constant supervision, they are still responsible for whatever their child does when supervised or not.  \n\nYou're NTA.  Good lesson for the kid to learn natural consequences of his actions.", "NTA. My 6 year old knows not to eat things without permission, especially in closed containers, her 8 year old should definitely know better. It's not your fault that her child thought they could get away with something and found out differently.", "NTA. People seem to commonly believe that just because something bad happens in your home, it\u2019s your fault. It was ultimately up to Steven\u2019s mother to supervise him, and I\u2019m still not sure how she\u2019s doing the mental gymnastics to put you at fault. He shouldn\u2019t eat things without asking. She probably knows it\u2019s not, but wants the financial help. Don\u2019t do it. Things happen, it\u2019s not always someone\u2019s fault or responsibility. Kids get hurt and do dumb things sometimes, is she gonna do this every time something happens to the kid??", "NTA, but your friend is.  She hasn\u2019t even taught the poor kid the basics of acceptable behavior.  She\u2019s an awful mother.", "NTA\n\nCharge her for the cost of the life lesson given to the kid to not eat random stuf , especially stuff inside a sealed container \n\nTell her it\u2019s equivalent of half the cost of molar removal", "NTA.  She should have been more diligent with watching him, and should also have drilled it into his mind not to randomly eat something without asking first.  Hard and expensive lesson on her part.", "NTA! What, would she have asked you to pay for his stomach pumping if he drank window cleaner because it looked like blue raspberry kool-aid? The child has poor manners and a lack of judgment and critical thinking. It's not on you in any way.", "NTA. The kid tried to sneak a \"chocolate\" without getting caught. He fucked around and found out.", "NTA. 8 years old is more than old enough to know what you should not touch. She apologized in the moment, so she knows he was wrong. She's trying to shift stuff in her head after hearing the bill but stand strong! Be polite but firm.", "Nope. NTA. Either he is old enough not to put things in his mouth, or he is young enough to require supervision. Either way, no blame accrues to OP.", "NTA. There is no way this should be your responsibility and your friend should never have asked.", "NTA. How long does it take to say \"Hey, (mum's friend) can I have one of those chocolate things?\"", "NTA - her child is her responsibility.", "Wait, what?  Your friend has lost her mind. How exactly is it your fault that her kid doesn\u2019t know to keep his hands off other people\u2019s property, especially a closed container. And he\u2019s 8 - when was she going to teach him not to put just anything into his mouth because he wants it?  I\u2019m sorry but people are getting ridiculous with expecting other people to pay for their kids stupidity and their laziness as parents, not to mention wanting to file lawsuits at any slight or inconvenience. It\u2019s a joke. Do not pay her anything and when she files her small claims case to get the money she thinks she is entitled to, advise the judge of the facts. If she was an attentive mother who taught her kid manners, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. NTA.", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d is an AH for even suggesting this. Hopefully you\u2019ve learned your lesson with this person.", "NTA and also the arguments that it was on a kitchen island and accessible is ridiculous. If you had a decorative fruit made from solid steel that they tried to eat it would have resulted in the same issue, but does that mean it's unreasonable for someone to have decorative fruit in an accessible location in a kitchen? Fuck that.\n\nMacadamia nuts are accessible in a shop. If a child grabbed one and bit into it without purchasing it first is it also the shops fault?", "No, she\u2019s an asshole for blaming you in any way", "NTA. She is responsible to manage her kid. Kids make mistakes, some are minor and some quite costly. Price of parenting.", "NTA, and if all they\u2019re doing is pulling the tooth it shouldn\u2019t be an overly expensive procedure anyway? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to crown it or anything.", "NTA\n\ud83d\ude02 Tell June to be so friggin fr\nHer nosey kid got into something that wasn't his, as he was unsupervised and got hurt. That's a her problem, not a you problem.", "NTA. This is entirely your friend\u2019s fault for 1) not supervising her child, and 2) not teaching them to NOT eat stuff without asking at other peoples homes. It\u2019s ridiculous for her to ask you to pay anything towards it let alone half. It sucks she has an unexpected medical expense but it\u2019s not your responsibility. She is an AH for trying to bully you into paying for her bad parenting. If she threatens your friendship over it I would tell her to piss off.

Oh, hell no.  Kids do stupid things, and they (and their parents) are responsible for it.  He was not offered a nut, he took it without asking.  You are in no way responsible to pay for something you had no hand in other than it was in your house.  The thief pays the price for what he stole.", "nta for bad parenting of your friend.\n\n8 y/o isn't 4, he's well past the oral phase so instead of money you paid her with 2 valuable lessons:\n\nfor the mom: keep your eyes on your child, he's not a responsible adult and letting him go unsupervised in a kitchen could even be ground for Child Protective Services to get involved. what if he found a knife?\n\nfor the kid: you're not entitled to eat whatever you see just because you're small and cute. i can guarantee that this kid will think twice before doing something stupid like that again. just be glad he broke a tooth that would have fallen anyway", "NTA. I'm no legal expert, but for you to be financially liable you would have had to show intention, negligence, and for the nuts to be an attractive nuisance like an open body of water, or open container of food, none of which apply here..NTA and imo worth dropping the friendship over. You don't want to be friends with a person who uses you as a cash cow when she's clearly in the wrong.", "NTA. I mean seriously? I cracked an incisor on a pork scratching once, should the manufacturer reimburse me for the filling? It\u2019s her kids responsibility what he shoves in his mouth, and she should have taught him not to just help himself to everything he sees. The bottom line is he thought it was chocolate so he just helped himself without asking. Very rude. At 8 he should know better. Now he will learn, like I did, to be careful how you bite things. Lucky for him he will get another tooth to replace the broken one! \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her anything.", "NTA \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f people are absurd.", "NTA. She is responsible for her child.", "NTA. Are you sure she\u2019s a friend?", "NTA\u2014your friend is a bad friend for asking. Her kid, her responsibility. Teach the kid to only eat what\u2019s offered at other peoples houses.", "Who the heck leaves an 8 year old unsupervised in the kitchen?!

If you wanted to be a friend, I guess you could. I personally think that your friend is shitty for asking you to pay.

Don\u2019t pay the bill.", "No friend would expect that from a friend.", "Oooohhh so your friend is trying to use you for your money. NTA, but your friend is a loser for trying to make you pay for something that\u2019s her fault. Are you supposed to childproof your whole damn house before she brings her goblin over? I don\u2019t think so. Don\u2019t get guilted into paying for that bullshit, that\u2019s her own fault.", "Your respective financial situations don't negate her responsibility to watch her child and teach him to ask permission before eating someone else's food. Don't pay that bill.", "If it's only a couple hundred, it might be nice to offer half. This was clearly an accident, and even though it's the kid's fault in principle, it may be a nice gesture, if you can.", "No! Totally unintentional and I hadn't even spotted it! ha!", "If my worst fears are confirmed, the entire macadamia supply chain might be part of some sort of global conspiracy.  This might even go as far up as\u2026 the White House.", "Why has God forsaken us!", "Doing something stupid as a kid doesn't magically make the person not related to the kid responsible. it's the parents responsibility. when I was 8 I knew not to touch other peoples belongings without asking first. in my own house yeah I got into shenanigans and broke stuff here and there but never at other peoples houses.", "How is that even relevant? When I was 10, I tried to run up the down escalator at an airport. I fell and split my knee open. I needed 13 stitches. My mom did not demand that the airport pay for half of it.", "Calling CPS over an unsupervised child in the kitchen is absolutely wild lol", "Yep. Leave your kid unsupervised in my house and want me to pay for their stupidity when they steal my stuff? Absofuckinglutely.", "8 is old enough to know you should keep your booger hooks off other people\u2019s stuff without asking.", "Google \"premises liability laws\" and just look up some cases. You'll be furious. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05", "You clearly aren't super familiar with u.s. case law.\n\nPeople have had to pay robbers for less serious injury.", "\u201cEstablish causality\u201d\n\nFound my person. Lol", "NTA \nAnd exactly.  Imagine OP leaving out pet food, or a container of stuff she meant to throw away.", "Right?!  How hard did he bite down?  Macadamia nuts are very hard he should have realized right off that he wasn't going to be able to bite it without damaging his teeth.", "For real. Did he seriously bite down with all of his might on the first try? I bet not. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he took a few \u201ctest\u201d bites, found it was hard, and thought \u201chuh I should bite down with the force of a thousand suns on this super hard chocolate.\u201d", "Sounds like he's the macadamia", "I mean, even smart people have their lapses into dumb. Still she\u2019s def NTA.", "I think the friendship is over.", "Yup how many treats and such has helped himself to that op and mom were unaware of. This time he got caught because  he was fucking around and found out the hard way.", "He\u2019s an 8 year old. You don\u2019t need to say such things about him. He\u2019s not even 10 yet, children make mistakes and do things they shouldn\u2019t. Can\u2019t believe I see adults in this sub talking about a literal child this way.", "Something like that\u2026.the dad blamed it on the friend", "This - my child's safety is MY responsibility, not someone else's.", "Or just even asked!", "\u201cThis is going to be difficult to afford right now. Is there any chance you could help me out with a loan?\u201d looks a lot different than \u201cThis is your fault for having food in your own kitchen and I expect you to pay for it!\u201d", "If she's in financial trouble then she can't afford to let her kid run around unsupervised.", "I agree with this.  I wouldn\u2019t pay because it was my fault, but I would pay if paying was something I could easily afford to do, and if not paying would cause my friend a great financial hardship.  \n\nThe friend could definitely have gone about asking for financial help in a nicer way.  It sounds like the friend may be too proud to ask for help. As you mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of context and nuance that goes into this than just \u201cAITA?\u201d", "i definitely think this is a worth while thought process to go through. i would combine this with also something other commenters were mentioning about talking to her about the insistence on you paying for her half / the implication that it\u2019s your responsibility to do so\n\nif y\u2019all are able to talk it through and she can admit/realize that it\u2019s really not your responsibility and it was unreasonable / tbh unkind of her to put it on you, and after that you have the financial means and desire to help her out with the bill, then that would be a lovely thing to do on your end", "No. The child's mom shouldn't be asking to begin with. That shows disrespect given her kid f'ed up.", "I think this is the best answer.", "Yes it\u2019s the blame shifting more than the money itself which is concerning", "Global conspiracy, White House, this case is nuts! \n\nWho do we call? Who do we trust? PETA? WHO?Rainforest alliance -they always seemed kinda sketchy to me\u2026", "Big macadamia is in bed with big dental", "Yeah, that person is nuts. You're not required to literally have eyes on your child at all times. Parents would go crazy. I teach my son independence and safety, and he gets his own snacks, makes toast, etc.", "I thought doing 'test bites' was something people learned instinctively from a young age just like knowing when something is too hot and not just shoving it into your mouth to get burns.", "He also didn\u2019t bother tasting it. Macadamia shell doesn\u2019t taste like chocolate.", "He's 8, I doubt even the  smartest 8 year old would realize the impossibility till they' d already broke the tooth. (Especially not having seen a macadamia nut before.)\n\nHeck DAE recall the news story about the *adult* man trying to sue a restaurant for not telling him that you are only supposed to eat the tender parts of the boiled artichoke and ended up with digestive distress from the hard leaves?", "And good riddance", "NTA. You are not responsible for the dental fees, and it was unreasonable of her to ask.  And yes, the friendship is over.", "Or, hot take, nothing like this has happened in several years they've known each other, she asked a question that was maybe ill-advised, but also might not push it and accept OP saying no since we're still in the very early stages of this story and she hasn't shown any huge signs of pushiness.\n\nWe don't always have to jump to the worst possible conclusion lol. This is pretty low-stakes compared to the soap opera drama we usually see on here.", "Yes good distinction", "That part. It\u2019s not okay for the friend to make this seem like a responsibility thing just because she needs help\u2014if that is what\u2019s going on. And I feel like accepting to pay out of kindness could be a problem later because it would seem like accepting responsibility. What if there\u2019s some other tooth issue or complication later? I think if OP does choose to help pay, which would be a nice but not necessary thing to do to help a friend with less money, she should explicitly frame it as an offer of help but not a responsibility for what happened.", "I would also add that the friend isn\u2019t allowed to bring the child over anymore until she parents better. Sorry not sorry, the kid\u2019s 8 and did something a toddler would do. Clearly there\u2019s a lack of boundaries & consequences here. OP, regardless if you pay or not, it\u2019s time to set some ground rules for coming over to your house and stick to them.!", "Again with the black and white thinking.", "Yah! Even holding the nut with his hands should have been enough to tell the kiddo how hard it was. It wouldn't have felt like soft chocolate.", "Funny you'd say that... My husband is 60 (!!!!) and he NEVER learned that if something just came out of the oven it's HOT- I have to remind him every time, otherwise he shoves it in his mouth, screams, and then spits it out with \"Why didn't you tell me it was hot??!\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don't ask me why he's like that- no one has any clue, including himself \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44", "I guess, for this child, this is that learning experience. From now on, they will always test bite things to make sure they aren't too HARD.", "Funny little anecdote about test bites. Year before last was my grandpa's last Christmas. On Christmas eve, we had the table nicely decorated, and there were some chocolate balls on the table and they were wrapped with colored foil.\n\nGrandpa, being himself, was chatting with someone and didn't look what he was doing as he popped one of the red foil covered chocolate balls in his mouth, and then started chewing... the look of disguist on that man's face was pure comedy gold. For the next minute or so he spat out small balls of foil. He also spent the rest of the event distrusting all chocolates.\n\nI wish I had a video or photo of that. It was truly hilarious.", "He had to get a closed container off the island, open it & take out the nut. It wasn\u2019t just out there for the taking. Tuff shit for his mum.  But her insurance should cover it. If you Really like her you might offer to help pay, if you can afford it. Keep us updated.", "My husband used to work at a chef at a restaurant where they served tamales. They got a complaint one day from a woman who said the tamales were the worst she\u2019d ever tasted. Turned out she tried to eat them with the husks on. We live in Texas. No tamale anywhere is served without the husk. She did not get a refund, but everyone in the kitchen laughed about her for weeks. People are dumb.", "I don't blame that man. Artichoke is the weirdest food ever, and it's quite hard to tell what's edible and what isn't.", "My husband ate the pods  of the edamame, we just laughed our asses of at him, no lawsuits, lmao!!!", "I mean that's very different, i've never had artichoke before so if it was put on a plate infront of me how am I meant to naturally know what's good and what's bad, it's very reasonable to assume a restaurant would serve you edible food", "There is a type of artichoke that can be eaten whole. I've had one before in a restaurant in New Jersey!", "No, no. Everyone here was perfect by age 8 and already working on their Masters thesis, never making mistakes or injuring themselves.", "As a parent to a 7 year old I mostly agree with this. Not banning her friends child, but while he\u2019s over he must be under direct supervision and earn back the trust that he won\u2019t just go putting random stuff in his mouth.", "Reminds me of the scene from Reba when van shoves the hot pocket in his mouth right after taking it out of the microwave lol \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you wait 30 seconds?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t you cook?\u201d Is frequently quoted between my sister and I when something is hot", ">\"Why didn't you tell me it was hot??!\"\n\n\"Uh, the oven told you. Sorry you weren't listening.\"\n\nAnd that's how an argument would start at my house lol", "Can you PLEASE answer this for me. My wife and I MUST know. Has your husband ever ordered the Mexican fajitas that sizzle in the tiny castor irons? If so, what happened????", "My husband does the same thing. Even if I warned him, he would still do it. So, I started not giving him a fork or drink when dinner is served. He'll sit down, realize he needs a fork and drink and by the time he gets it the food will have cooled enough to eat comfortably.", "Ngl, I don't think I could be married to someone that stupid who also solely blames me for his stupidity. From your comment, the whole thing feels like a \"you met him back in the 70s when nobody cared about dumb dudes taking their own stupidity and selfishness out on their partners\" thing tbh. Like, seriously girl, have some self respect and the next time he burns his widdle baby mouth, tell him he's not a fucking toddler, he's an old ass man, and you won't treat him like a child anymore.", "Yikes honey! So your man is the reason there are so many directions on boxes of frozen food? You have a great sense of humor about it!", "Do you remind him that water is wet?", "First time I ever had a tamale, I was either eight or nine. I was with *four* grown adults at a real Mexican restaurant. Not a single one of those assholes told me that you do not, in fact, eat the corn husk *with* the tamale. (I know better *now*, but I still can't eat them.)", "It might be a shock but there are restaurants that do serve husk-free tamales. There aren't many, but I've found a small handful that do (mostly in TX, but also in AZ).", "I'll admit my first time trying tamales a year or so ago, I did indeed bite into the husk. I pretty quickly figured out you aren't supposed to do that, though; and I definitely call back and complain.", "I don't fully disagree with a sort of litigious culture, but it is a shame that you can't risk giving a refund to someone for that mistake. Since, assuming you aren't on the verge of going out of business, it seems like you may as well refund the poor person who tried to eat the inedible bit. \n\nNow if she tried to eat the shell of an oyster...", "My husband and I did this. We ate I think one each and gave up and said they were awful. My mom and my sister laughed so hard when we told them and we all figured out the problem.", "Same for me, the first time I went to a \u201csushi track\u201d style restaurant. \n\nMe: <points to bowl> What are those?\n\nFriend: Edamame. You\u2019ll like those. <Resumes setting up a dipping bowl with her wasabi and sauces>\n\nMe: <Chewing and making disgusted faces>\n\nFriend: NO! You have to pop them out of the pod! \ud83d\ude02", "You kinda have a point but also imagine saying that about an egg or something. There's heaps of foods that have bits you don't or can't eat, and it's reasonable for a restaurant to assume you know how to eat the things you order or will ask the staff.", "Well, they also put chicken and steak with bones, no?", "The point being \"even adults have awkward encounters with new food items.\".  I got served artichokes by a friend who coached me on how they were eaten an I now love them.", "The point is, even adults have awkward encounters meeting a new food item.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I love that scene so much!! When he's trying to cool it down by huffing really fast. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "When I was about 8 or so, we hard artichokes fir dinner. I had never seen one and was scraping the wrong end if each leaf/petal/whatever. My dad got a good laugh at my honest mistake, and I was embarrassed. All I did was copy what I thought the rest of the family was doing. How was I supposed to know I was doing it wrong if no one taught me better?", "I don't know about you but I've never had a restaurant serve me an egg with a shell on it xD\nI  do get your point too though, it's really all about what's more likely to be known I guess", "I don't think I've ever been given an egg with its shell on in a restaurant. \n\nI also don't think I've been given inedible parts of an artichoke before. Usually when I've had them presented to me, it's just the hearts.", "The HACHACHACHACHA is the best. I do it every time I\u2019m eating something from my sister\u2019s microwave \ud83d\ude02", "Now I'm feeling like the weird one because I used to get boiled eggs and toast every week from a cafe near me lol. I thought it was normal! If I'd known I was going to get two comments about it I'd have used an example like... the rice paper in the steamer basket for dumplings or bones or something haha", "I think people are more familiar with the other examples, tbh. Artichokes are kinda weird."]}
