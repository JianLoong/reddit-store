Me and my gf (26F) are overjoyed as we a couple of years planning and trying for a child (she recently miscarried).\n\nWe have recently told my family the good news as we wanted to wait until the second trimester before we told anyone due to our recent loss. My family were mostly excited for me and my partner and seemed quite supportive. My parents were initially excited that they were going to be having their first grandchildren however this all went downhill when my sister (35F) started to get upset.\n\nFor context, my sister is married and has tried to have a baby for many years although she was unsuccessful and was told that she is unlikely to reproduce. My sister is very against adoption as she wants children with her DNA. \n\nWhen we announced that I was actually having twins and shared that we were going to having both a boy and girl, my sister started to kick up a fuss and told me that it wasn't fair that I a \"Dyke\" was allowed to have children but she wasn't. My sister started to argue and my gf immediately got involved and told me sister that she needs to back off and eventually we left and went home. \n\nA couple of days later my parents phoned me and asked to speak with me privately. I agreed but told my gf where I was going. Once I arrived at my parents home, my sister and her husband was also there. My sister apologised for what she said and said she had a question. She then asked me to give her my son so that she could have a baby to raise. I thought she was joking and chuckled a little. She didn't find this funny and immediately started to say that I was very selfish for keeping both of my babies and that she deserved a baby too and it wasn't like that I wasn't going to have a child to raise. I was taken aback and told her that thought process was rather crazy and said she needed to seek therapy. I told her that I was not going to allow her around my children if she didn't get the help she needed. \n\nMy parents think this was harsh and my sister deserves to raise a baby. I told her that she could adopt or get a surrogate. My sister told me that she didn't want some \"dirty peasants\" baby and that she needed one that \"belonged\" to her, and had her DNA. That was when I brought up that the babies I am carry do not have my DNA as we used my gfs eggs. My sister immediately started screaming that I tricked her... but she still wanted one of my babies. I stated my boundary again and said that if she does not seek help she will not be allowed around my children. \n\nMy parents, sister and some of my extended family think that I am selfish and an AH for not giving my sister the opportunity to raise a child and that as I'm having twins its only fair. I think this thinking is absolutely crazy and will not be allowing anyone who agrees with my sister around my kids. This has created a huge argument with the family with many people saying that I am being very selfish, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1685048648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rtb4v/aita_for_not_allowing_my_sister_to_see_my_children/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess I now know who the golden child is in your family. Your sister is delusional and needs to know that she is not entitled to your babies. And don't take what she said as a heat of the moment thing, she just showed her true colors, and it's best not to have her around.", "NTA\n\nTime to go LC/NC with your family members including your parents. It's cuckoo birds that you're surrounded by people 1) cater to your sister and 2) think nothing of telling you to give up one of your babies so your sister can be a mother. That's just craziness.\n\nYour sister needs help and, I mean...your entire family probably needs therapy, too.", "Holy. Shit. Your sister and your family are way way way off the rails. It isn't only your sister you have to stay away from. She's demented enough to kidnap a kid. You are not selfish to want to raise you're own kids. Wow. I'm floored. Does your family have some sort of communicable brain maggots? NTA", "NTA.  Your are right that it's absolutely crazy.  But you didn't go far enough, your requirement that you have for your sister should be extended to your parents.  It's bat shit crazy they supported your sister in this scheme and you can also add your BIL as well.  None of them should have contact with you or your future kids.", "NTA This demand is beyond bizarre and as a mom of twins myself, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable being around anyone who was vehemently demanding one of my kids. I\u2019d even be concerned about kidnapping and would go NC with everyone who advocated giving her one of my children. She definitely needs therapy and I hope she finds peace because she sounds mentally ill.", "NTA.   You should  move far, far away", "No get a restraining order in case your sister try to steal one of your babies", "Um\u2026what??? How could someone possibly think this is a normal request? I mean I kind of doubt this is real because who would just ask for another person\u2019s child? And then the parents seem to support the request? On the off chance it is real though, very obviously NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m honestly stunned at what I just read. Is your sister (and maybe your parents & BIL)living on another planet? It\u2019s the only logical explanation to this whole situation. I can\u2019t believe your parents went along with that. You\u2019re not wrong for not wanting your children near her. \n1. She made a very homophobic comment and you don\u2019t want that anywhere near your children. \n2. She sounds unstable and the fact that she feels so entitled to one of your children (down to the fact she even \u2018chose\u2019 which baby she wanted) would make me really nervous she\u2019d try and do a runner with one of the babies.\n3. You are not preventing your sister from having a child. There are many different ways to have a child some of which you mentioned above. It\u2019s just that your sister has some really ignorant, twisted views.\n\nWhat did her husband do/ say during all of this? \n\nIt sounds like her fertility journey has really done a number on her and in my completely unqualified opinion she needs professional help yesterday. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing. You\u2019re keeping your family safe. (And congratulations, I wish you the best of luck)", "NTA your parents and sister are unhinged to even think this is a reasonable request.\n\nPlease pass word protect all your medical files. Let the hospitals know that your family is not to be any where the babies with out your or your wife\u2019s consent.\n\nPlace security cameras around your home. Buy a ring doorbell so they record sound. And save all text messages and document everything. This will be needed if you have to get a protection order.\n\nPlease do not look past this. Do not let her around your children. Do not leave your parents alone with your children.\n\nPlease be vigilant and see the threat. Family or not your first priority is your babies. Your family is unhinged.", "\u201cMy parents, sister and some of my extended family think that I am selfish and an AH for not giving my sister the opportunity to raise a child and that as I'm having twins its only fair.\u201c\n\nAs a mom of twins, this thinking really upsets me. Twins are not a \u201ccopy and paste\u201d deal. They are individual beings and they are both your children. To suggest you give away your child, even to another family member, is despicable. \n\nNTA. And I would consider cutting contact with your parents unless they come to their senses.", "NtA. This is just ludicrous, is your sister s cartoon villain? Frankly, I wouldn't even let your parents alone with the kids unless they start to come correct because even entertaining this is wild", "NTA. Just be aware that statistically stranger danger is not something to actually be very concerned about. Kidnappings, abductions, and the perpetrators of sex crimes against children are usually someone the family knows. This family is primed to either hurt or abduct one of your children. Keep them away at all costs and do not let them know what roof your children sleep under.", "NTA. Your sister totally ruined her chance of being an aunt, and enjoying caring for her nephew and niece. She's literally insane for thinking you should just hand over your child, like as if you owe it to her. Her not being able to conceive is 100% not your fault, or your problem. And your parents, and the family members who think this behaviour is okay, are also insane. Holy shit!", "NTA. I would also twll your parents to get therapy too. If they support your sister now, they could kidnap your kids for your sister later on.", "NTA The last thing any baby needs is your sister as a mother.", "Your parents seem to think you're still kids and it's ok to make you share toys and sweets. Holy fuck, this is such an inappropriate request, that you'd have to be crazy to stay in contact with these people. Maybe before you block them you could ask them which one of their children they would have happily given away. NTA", "NTA, inform your doctor, inform the hospital and inform the police where you live if shes really this crazy it may get worse and she may try to take your baby. go full NC and be prepared to file for a RO for fear of child abduction. like legit your family is bananas.", "NTA. This is crazy. Every time you think you've heard it all, someone comes around and tells you about their crazy family.", "What the actual fuck is wrong with your family?  I was not able to have children, so I understand that pain, but her asking you to give her one of your babies is insane.  She needs professional help, and so do your parents because they are just as unwell.  How can they support this?  Everyone is acting like it's the same as asking for one of the two handbags you got for Christmas.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA, and if it was me, I wouldn't allow any of them near those babies, no contact whatsoever.", "NTA. This is seriously effed and your sister (and parents) are unhinged to expect to be given a child like chattel just because they refuse other options to have a child like adoption or surrogacy. \n\nYou and your gf are at an exciting time in your lives to raise children. Your sister can pound sand.", "NTA, that is absolutely insane.  Your sister is certifiable. You should tell anyone who is ok with her thought process that they should consider giving her one of their children or being a surrogate for her if they are all that committed to this idea.  Congrats on your beautiful babies, and be safe.", "NTA! Time to go LC/NC with your family!", "NTA. But I would be very careful and go full NC with her and very low with your parents. Don\u2019t give her any info re. The babies (congrats btw!). Make sure everything is foolproof, document everything you can do that she can\u2019t take one of your kids. She\u2019s insane. And your whole family is insane. They\u2019re your babies. With your wife. You\u2019re not gonna give one up obviously.", "I can\u2019t believe I read this?! Wow you need to keep them all away or one of your babies will disappear.", "This is, indeed,beyond crazy and it is not just your sister who has lost it - it is everyone allowing her to even utter that thought.
