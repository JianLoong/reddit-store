{"id": 19817, "submission_id": "14auxc3", "title": "AITA for saying to my partner he needs to figure out where to hang up a dishcloth on his own because he\u2019s a grown adult?", "selftext": "So, my partner and I have been together for three years now, living together for most of it, and we argue quite a lot about household chores.\nThe other day, we were both in the kitchen, about to make dinner. He wanted to cook for us, but before we started, the kitchen was messy. I asked him if he could clean up his dishes from the day, and I offered to clean the hob and the kitchen side so they would be ready to be used for cooking.\n\nAfter we both finished, he had washed up, but he left the sponges and dishcloths wet in the sink. I politely asked him not to leave them there because they would become moldy, and I requested that he take the sponge out of the sink and hang the dishcloth out to dry. Instead, he stuffed them into a compartment on the drying rack where they obviously wouldn't dry. I pointed out his mistake, and he responded by asking where exactly I wanted him to put them, implying that his choice wasn't right. I told him that as a grown adult, I simply wanted him to choose somewhere to hang them up himself, as I didn't want to be responsible for all the decisions. \n\nInstances like this happen quite frequently. For example, he often misplaces items and asks me where they are, which is fine, but he never puts a system in place to reduce this issue, and it ends up impacting both of our lives. I seem to be the only one to remember what groceries we need, remembering to buy toiletries, towels and bedding laundry, just keeping on top of the household chores in general. \n\nWhen I told him to figure it out himself, he got really annoyed and accused me of being mean to him. I genuinely didn't understand how I was being mean; I just want someone who would take initiative with decisions like that. \n\nHe stormed off and went to play a computer game, while I sat alone in the room. After about 20 minutes, I went into the room where he was playing his game and told him that I would start cooking dinner. Around five minutes later, he abruptly came in, grabbed the saucepans and frying pans out of my hands as I was using them, and started swearing at me. He brought up our earlier conversation about how I had been mean to him, and then he told me to get the fuck out of the kitchen. I complied and left him to it. He then proceeded to shout from the kitchen \u2018I\u2019m only cooking for myself now.\u2019\n\nOn one hand, I think I could be the asshole because it would have been easy for me to say, \"just hang it up on the drying rack or on a radiator\u201d instead of telling him to figure it out himself, and I guess pointing out that he should know where to put it so it dries because he\u2019s an adult is a bit condescending.
