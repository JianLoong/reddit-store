{"id": 19817, "submission_id": "14auxc3", "title": "AITA for saying to my partner he needs to figure out where to hang up a dishcloth on his own because he\u2019s a grown adult?", "selftext": "So, my partner and I have been together for three years now, living together for most of it, and we argue quite a lot about household chores.\nThe other day, we were both in the kitchen, about to make dinner. He wanted to cook for us, but before we started, the kitchen was messy. I asked him if he could clean up his dishes from the day, and I offered to clean the hob and the kitchen side so they would be ready to be used for cooking.\n\nAfter we both finished, he had washed up, but he left the sponges and dishcloths wet in the sink. I politely asked him not to leave them there because they would become moldy, and I requested that he take the sponge out of the sink and hang the dishcloth out to dry. Instead, he stuffed them into a compartment on the drying rack where they obviously wouldn't dry. I pointed out his mistake, and he responded by asking where exactly I wanted him to put them, implying that his choice wasn't right. I told him that as a grown adult, I simply wanted him to choose somewhere to hang them up himself, as I didn't want to be responsible for all the decisions. \n\nInstances like this happen quite frequently. For example, he often misplaces items and asks me where they are, which is fine, but he never puts a system in place to reduce this issue, and it ends up impacting both of our lives. I seem to be the only one to remember what groceries we need, remembering to buy toiletries, towels and bedding laundry, just keeping on top of the household chores in general. \n\nWhen I told him to figure it out himself, he got really annoyed and accused me of being mean to him. I genuinely didn't understand how I was being mean; I just want someone who would take initiative with decisions like that. \n\nHe stormed off and went to play a computer game, while I sat alone in the room. After about 20 minutes, I went into the room where he was playing his game and told him that I would start cooking dinner. Around five minutes later, he abruptly came in, grabbed the saucepans and frying pans out of my hands as I was using them, and started swearing at me. He brought up our earlier conversation about how I had been mean to him, and then he told me to get the fuck out of the kitchen. I complied and left him to it. He then proceeded to shout from the kitchen \u2018I\u2019m only cooking for myself now.\u2019\n\nOn one hand, I think I could be the asshole because it would have been easy for me to say, \"just hang it up on the drying rack or on a radiator\u201d instead of telling him to figure it out himself, and I guess pointing out that he should know where to put it so it dries because he\u2019s an adult is a bit condescending. But, on the other hand, I feel like it's reasonable to expect my partner to take the initiative in situations like this.\n\nEdit: couple people asking our ages im 24 hes 25, also we\u2019re not married", "created_utc": 1686916653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14auxc3/aita_for_saying_to_my_partner_he_needs_to_figure/", "score": 2788, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He eventually would have apologized for overreacting and I would have apologized for trying to boss him around. I feel like your partner had the right to be annoyed with you, but that his reaction was just too much. If he'd done that to me, I'd be reconsidering the relationship.\n\nThird, if you really want a partner that takes initiative to do things the way that you want them done, then find a new partner. I'm dead serious. It's that or learn to let the little things go. I wish I'd learned that lesson earlier. I like things to be done in a very specific way, but then I find myself aggravated if I feel like I don't get enough help.

But be forewarned that some people just seem to be stuck on certain things, and this type of frustration may very well continue.\n\nIf you want someone who takes initiative and is orderly, your SO doesn't seem to fit your relationship as you imagine it should be. Can you perhaps appreciate when he DOES take initiative? Like when he wanted to prepare y'all's dinner? Can you forgive his \"faults\" in tidyness? You might be able to improve his orderly-ness and initiative in some small way, but he will never be orderly/tidy in the way you seem to be imagining.\n\nBut again, kindness is free (and check your sarcasm at the door; sarcasm has no place in a loving relationship)", "YTA for being so passive-aggressive. Plus, the way you describe this encounter is so incredibly slanted in your favor. \n\nEverything you've written tells me to avoid you at all costs.", "ESH\n\nSo, three things\n\n1) He sounds like he has adhd. Do you know if he does? \n\nThat would explain why it happens so often, and why he has not put in place a system to prevent it. \n(This is nased on my own experience, my adhd, I'm diagnosed now and we are happier.)\n\n\n2) Whatever the reason (adhd included), is not an excuse! \n\nI don't like the way he communicates to you, blames you, taking things our of your hands and to claim to only cook for himself. Nothing excuses such behaviour over time. \n\n3) Cleaning is a learned skill\nIt would have been easy for you to give him an answer this particular time. His lack of doing the \"right thing\" points imo to him having little knowledge of cleaning and how it all works.\n\nI am the same way. Also it doesn't help if my boyfriend teaches me one day, my adhd brain forgets, so I have started to make small lists for each room, on which cloths to use, what cleaning products to use, dosage, etc. My brain refuses to retain such information, so I've started to write it down. \n\nThen I'm going to print it, and also have it on my phone in case I lose the prints..\n\n\nYou both can do better than that situation!", "It's never about the dishcloth....", "NTA. I regularly have this battle with my husband too. He's gotten better now, but the \"you're being mean\" came through quite often when I simply didn't have the bandwidth to help him use his own brain. \nHe'll also ask me where the towels are, when they have only ever been kept in the same linen cupboard of the house for the past 5 years. Now when he asks me, I simply tell him I hid them just to spite him. He rolls his eyes and them goes to get a towel from the same place they always are. He doesn't like that I'm sarcastic, and I don't like that he has no memory of simple systems.\nI think this is a fairly common cohabitation gripe.\n\nI feel your pain OP. You are NTA.", "Well.... he sounds like a complete jerk, but OP did, essentially, do a huge passive-aggressive move by telling him to figure it out for himself. He tried two separate solutions (leave the stuff in the sink and put them on the drying rack), neither of which were the **right** answer for OP. There was only one right answer and OP refused to provide it. That would piss me off too. However, the BF blew a gasket over something super trivial. So I'm going with ESH.", "So I am going to go the other way slightly and ESH with a possibility of YTA.\n\nSome people, sadly often men or those with differing neural pathways, have not been taught these things and so the thought processes they need to make these decisions reasonably are not there.  If you have never considered a dish cloth could get mouldy, how do you consider stopping it.  My daughter doesn't understand this yet.  My husband had been given no chores as a child and I have had to teach him the how and why of everything and he still gets concerned and needs reassurance on reasoning and how to as he has only done this for 10 years to my 32 aka in chore age he is 10 so asks questions you would expect from a 10 year old doing age appropriate chores.  Whilst some people do this sort of thing due to weponised incompatance aka completely know what to do but chose not to to take control and get a rise from the other, others truly do not know nor have the understanding to make this choice.  Yes these people are failed due to their upbringing but you cannot get angry or frustrated at them for something they do not know or understand.  If you had already, many times, explained this and helped him to consider this fact in an open and uncondicending manner then you have a right to be considered being problematic.  If this is new information to him or the only way you have talked to him about this is angry, confrontational or derogatory, he has a right to be frustrated and angry that you feel he is meant to make these inferences from thin air and your expectations for him to think like you is not on.\n\nOn the other hand, his behaviour towards you, snatching and grumping back at you was childish.  He had every right to feel what he did and let you know but he took it out on you and escalated the situation.  He disappeared and made no communication he would come back and do dinner and so you gave him some time to cool off and/or communicate, then you started food.  Not on on his end.\n\nBasically I think you both took your own feelings out on each other rather than communicating in an adult manner your wishes, concerns and feelings.  Relationships are a two way street of give and take.  You have to both realise that you need to respect and listen to each other and sometimes you may have to accept something you don't like in the give and take as a counterpoint to them accepting something they don't like.\n\nIf you are unable to communicate effectively with chores and haven't in a long time, maybe you need to consider the will to support each other through thick and thin, sickness and health, and to love and communicate effectively is not there and might never be in your relationship.", "ESH\n\nHe's irresponsible about certain things and instead of accepting him as he is, you are trying to be controlling... but only enough to make him do things your way or to feel bad. \n\nIf YOU have a problem with dishrags in the sink getting mildewed, this is YOUR problem. He doesn't think it's a problem, so it's not his problem. \n\nYou should fix your problems, not his, and you should not expect him to be responsible for your problems, even if your problem is 100% reasonable and his lack of a problem is unreasonable. \n\nI know this is going to be downvoted, but here's why this philosophy is important: If you want a relationship to succeed, it should NOT be permeated by power struggles. Allowing power struggles to take root is nearly certain to ruin the relationship at some future point. By finding ways to NOT finger-point even where it might be justified, you stand the greatest chance of your relationship growing and becoming more important over time.", "ESH, it is clear that neither of you respects the other and probably shouldn't be in a relationship if this is how you both treat each other", "ESH. \n\nYou both need to grow up. Even with your one sided narrative it\u2019s clear you talk down to him regularly, and there\u2019s surely more going on that you\u2019ve left out. \n\nEither break up or you both need to learn how to communicate and treat each other with respect. You obviously don\u2019t respect him.", "Nta but your relationship sounds horrible. The small bickering everyday over household chores would be like death by a thousand paper cuts. Are you happy with your life?", "ETA \n\nYou both sound exhausting. \n\nIf you want him to do something then be specific. Just say \u2018hang this up here so it dries\u2019, don\u2019t use the situation to make a point about him being an adult. Loads of people don\u2019t get it until it\u2019s pointed out to them and then it\u2019s obvious, but if it\u2019s an ongoing issue between you he isn\u2019t going to concede to you being right after you called him out for not adulting effectively", "I know I\u2019m in the minority here but ESH. It would have taken 2 seconds to suggest a place for him to hang the washcloth and kindness costs nothing. You told him he did it wrong twice (was that the only time that day/week you told him he was doing something wrong without offering your solution?) and when he asked what *do* you want you told him to read your mind and figure it out himself. I would have been frustrated too. If you\u2019re the partner with higher cleaning standards then you DO need to take the time to explain step by step how you expect a job to be done, even if it\u2019s minor. If you\u2019ve always been this bratty about expecting him to magically know what you want then no wonder he\u2019s clueless. \n\nHe sucks for the way he reacted. He completely flew off the handle in a totally inappropriate way, which makes me think this isn\u2019t the first time if he used to be a chill and laid back personality as you say. You both need to communicate more effectively. You both ruined the evening with your piss poor attitudes and if you can\u2019t be kind and helpful to each other you won\u2019t last.", "Unpopular opinion here but I think you're both wrong. Maybe after living together for awhile, you should have an idea of what that person's habits are like and if there is something you don't like, then you should bring it up to them and try to work it out. That's how communication works. However, if you had never encountered this issue before now then I don't think you should assume that this person knows how you like things. \n\nIn the house I grew up in we didn't have a radiator to throw towels on and hanging them up to dry was out of the question considering we never had a washcloth rack. Just toss it in the wash with all the other clothes then throw it in the dryer is all we did. Of course we were also never allowed to do the dishes because our mother needed them done in a specific way and only she trusted her own dish washing. \n\nEven now, I probably couldn't tell you proper dish washing etiquette. Just lather it up with soap, scrub it down and rinse it off idk. If you have something that you want or need done in a specific way, try a bit of communication. \n\nAs far as he goes, obviously he's in the wrong. For many reasons. He didn't convey his emotions to you in a way that could have a positive resolution. He only saw you as antagonizing and lashed out. He was probably never taught how to deal with his emotions so when he comes up to a situation that he doesn't understand or out of his control then he just lashes out. So on top of couples counseling I would recommend he sees a therapist. It's pretty easy to do these days, you can even do it online.\n\nHe should not have grabbed the pans out of your hands period and he should not have said he was cooking for himself, because at that point he was doing it out of spite because he felt like you had wronged him. When it was mostly just a case of miscommunication and misunderstanding. So yes, I would highly recommend he gets therapy because there is obviously a lot going on there. \n\nIt's easy enough for people to say \"Just leave them\" but I feel like half of these people have never been in a relationship before, because if they had they'd know that there are a lot of nuances and that things usually aren't that simple. It's not hard to look at someone's situation and tell them what they \"should\" do, but people fail to consider that it's not as easy as it looks to just \"leave\". On top of that, say you leave him. Well, then you've created two potential victims because if not OP, then who? If OP's partner was able to get this far with OP then they would likely do so with someone else should they break up. \n\nBetter to try and get him the help he needs now rather than later lest he just unload on another person. You're not his mother or his care taker by any means, but you are his partner so you should be supporting each other.", "ESH \n\nHe needs to read the comic about the Mental Load.  He\u2019s not thinking more than one step ahead.  If he wants to leave it there, fine but he\u2019s responsible for washing and replenishing them.  \n\nYou can\u2019t criticize and not offer solutions.  At least advise what you would have done in the situation.  I understand it\u2019s frustrating but you were antagonizing.  \n\nCouples counseling doesn\u2019t solve the problems you have.  It teaches you how to communicate better.  I think this would benefit you both.  The anger is overtaking both of you.  Best of luck to you.", "NAH any chance he has adhd and could benefit from a list or reminder system on this stuff?", "ESH. You want someone who takes initiative? Find them. Y'all aren't married. And, yes, you could have simply explained why the rack wasn't good enough and pointed him in the direction of where to hang the dish towel. Subsequently, he should know right? 2nd all of his behavior was foul after the fact. You take something out of my hands? Rude. You take over then decide to be petty and not cook for me as well? You're both disrespectful and seem not to be compatible in the long run if this is how you are going to engage with each other", "Yta... Okay  A**hole is a pretty strong word and I wouldn't use irl in that situation, but  In my opinion you lost respect and that's one of the worst things that can happen in a relationship. \nCould it be, that he has an issue with ADHD or something? Some of the things you described feel oddly familiar to me and I've been constantly belitteled and criticised for things, altough I tried my hardest to do everything right.\n\nI  get your frustration but I  think he made an effort by asking you how you wanted it to be done. Of course it's not okay for him to lash out to you in that way but I think hes been hurt by your remark (which would point towards ADHD even more)\n\nIf you really want to make an effort to solve this relationship: have an open talk to him, where you can both try to find solutions.", "NTA, but I think a different approach here is needed to address the issues. For most human beings, constant criticism is de-motivating and counterproductive. No matter how valid our feelings and criticisms, nit-picking every effort another person makes (even if well-intended, such as in your case) can wear a person down to the point where they just stop trying. I'm not saying this to blame you; just pointing out that this approach, especially in a marriage, rarely works.\n\nAnd I know this from personal experience.\n\nYears back, I was in a similar position/mindset as your husband. On a daily basis, my spouse often pointed out every little mistake I made (dishes not washed right, bed not made right, laundry not folded right, not packing moving boxes right, etc.). He frequently made remarks about how childish it was that I couldn't do these very basic adult chores. That these are things *all* adults know how to do...except me. I think, to him, he was merely voicing his frustrations and desperately wanting us to be in sync, in terms of how the house was managed. I felt bad that he took on all the chores himself (even though he made this choice himself), but truly didn't know what he wanted from me. He didn't want the sponge in the sink, but unless I put it exactly where he thought it should be, it seemed like I was always wrong.  Like your husband, I said to mine: \"Just tell me where/how/when you want this done.\" To me, it felt like I was constantly picked apart.\n\nAfter a series of *massive* blow outs between us, we sat down to talk, where he eventually acknowledged that he wasn't being entirely fair. I *was* doing the dishes, laundry, tidying, etc...it just was done in a way he didn't like.  I owned up to not being the best at consistency and efficiency with chores. Part of it was habits formed from my 20s, when I went from being a foster kid who wasn't allowed to do anything to having to do everything myself. Folding laundry was just wasn't a priority; having something clean to wear was. I was still unlearning these habits and figuring out my approach to chore/work/life balance when we first got married. I think talking this through calmly helped us both understand where the other was coming from. Because it's easy to assume your partner is lazy or being childish, but these habits are linked to our experiences, mental health, and sense of self-worth. It's hard to break them and then form new ones around what others expect us to do.\n\nI encourage you to consider sitting down and hearing him out. Speak from your own thoughts/feelings/perspective rather than listing out what he's doing wrong (which we all tend to do when upset). Allow him the space to do the same. Consider if it's possible that you might be imposing *your way* of doing things onto him, or if there really is an issue of chores not being done in a universally correct manner (there is usually a consensus on the right way to do things in the house). Discuss baby steps to how the two of you can meet halfway. In my case, I started with one chore (dishes) and went from there. We established an \"acknowledgement/appreciation\" system where we thank each other for doing stuff around the house. This might all sound childish to you, but adults need encouragement, too. They need others to have a bit of patience and understanding as they figure out all these \"adult\" things. And learning to do this is also an adult skill. There's a little growth here for both of you, which is pretty much part of marriage.\n\nI wish you both the best, and I hope this issue gets sorted soon.", "Truth is that a lot of stuff that seems entirely obvious to women who are usually brought up doing basic household chores  are totally mysterious to men especially if they've had everything done for them by their mothers.

Obviously  if they've been shown what to do and still don't do it - then get irritated.", "ESH. Yes he\u2019s an adult, but you\u2019re also treating him like a child.

Being talked to like you\u2019re his mother isn\u2019t going to teach him, leaving it in the sink and letting it get gross will teach him. Not correcting him constantly and letting him learn will teach him. You\u2019re not his mother, and he\u2019s not a child.

I stayed with my ex for several years because he was \u201cnice\u201d and my friends/family liked him and I guess on some level I felt like \u201ca bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\u201d And then I reached a breaking point, dumped him, started dating, and realized there are a lot of well-adjusted men who are a delight to spend time with. I have an amazing bf now who is truly a PARTNER and splits the responsibilities of our joint life fairly, without reminding, begging, and cajoling.

Good luck, and you can tell him to start by Googling a chore checklist and printing it out! Instead of asking you what he can do, he can just go down his list until he finds a task that needs doing. (If this feels scarily overwhelming or challenging for him, you can tell him to focus on running the checklist for a single room.
