We have been planning and discussing and so far it's just been the five of us. \n\nMy mom called me this past weekend and said that my oldest sister wanted to invite my cousin on vacation with us and asked what I thought. I immediately said I would not be coming if she was too. \n\nMy cousin has a 2 year old and a 4 year old and she would absolutely be bringing them if she came. I cannot imagine anything less relaxing than being on vacation with two toddlers, and as I said, I haven't been on vacation in six years. My mom said she agreed with me but was pretty neutral on the whole situation, but she would tell my sister that my cousin couldn't come. \n\nFlash forward to last night and my oldest sister called and told me I was a complete asshole for not letting my cousin come on vacation with us.

That's totally fine.", "That\u2019s not a vacation, it\u2019s a trip. \n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nYou worded it right, and you know your cousin well enough to know that the kids would end up there regardless of if you requested they not come. And you seem to already suspect they're going to drop the kids on you so the cousin can get the actual vacation. As you're closer to the situation, and given your sister's reaction... I think you hit the nail on the head but the rest of the family doesn't want to admit it when you didn't take the bait, that or the sister was the main instigator and the rest know this will blow up (as your sister seems to be a \"my way or the highway\" person).", "NTA at all.

Yes I know that likely said childcare would drop last minute as the mom would say she had it taken care of but really didn't and was lying the whole time. Plus whoever talked to her changed your words to stir up the pot...", "NTA. Small children are the complete opposite of relaxing. And you didn't say she couldn't go, you just said you wouldn't if she did which is very different. Stand your ground.", "Absolutely NTA.  Two little kids on vacation sounds like a nightmare\u2026 especially if you don\u2019t have kids and aren\u2019t used to kids. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "Nta", "NTA. There's a lot a group of adults won't be able to do if a 2 and 4 year old come along without having to leave your cousin out of it.

She conveniently forgot the vacation was being planned because your schedule has eased up. Then she complains that you won't let your cousin come on the trip.

Solo, or not.  Now that\u2019s relaxing, or can be if you choose the right line and itinerary.\n\nNTA.", "After I got divorced some friends were going on vacation.  Another family wanted in, no problem.  Then another family said that sounds like fun.  And so on and so forth.  I got in on that as well because it was a great way to be able to take my kids (8 and 11 at the time) on a vacation where we ALL could enjoy it.  The thing is 8 families, 28 people, all close friends, were up for it.  Everyone had kids.  If this was an adult trip and no one else was bringing kids it would never have crossed my mind to include myself knowing I'm imposing and changing the dynamic of the trip for everyone.  \n\nAn adult vacation is a completely different experience than one with kids.  NTA at all.", "NTA. One of my friends has a family member who always shows up on vacations with kids, now 4, 6, & 7, saying it's no big deal, they won't be in the way, and all that.

Worked like a charm.", "NTA.  Tell them you are fine with cousin coming along but that you won't go if it isn't a child-free trip. As in, if cousin shows up with the children you will immediately leave. \n\nBetter yet, ask your parents if they are willing to make this a trip for just your nuclear family.  With everyone grown and having their own lives, who know how many trips you'll have where all five of you can make it?", "NTA.  And I say this as a mother with three children ages 5 and under.", "NTA. It sounds like the original plan was immediate family only. This was not for extended family. Why is your sister so desperate to bring your cousin and her children? I understand why your mom wants to stay neutral in this but the new idea was not apart of the original plan. You should stress that you have not relaxed in 6 years and you want to just spend time with your parents and sisters only. That's a pretty reasonable request.", "NTA - I have a toddler, I love him dearly but a vacation with him would not be relaxing.", "NTA. Hill to die on. Do not go if she is going. You will not just not get a break, you will come back more stressed. And angry. And down money. And you will be crippled for what is next in your life because you are physically and mentally tired. If you think it\u2019s basically ruined at this point, just back out and do a spa week for yourself and reset. You will not regret it.", "Kinda nta So just dont go. Have some me time. Me time can be anywhere. Tell them to enjoy their time. Besides more then likely your cousin will want someone to babysit so she can have some downtime - guess what it would probably be you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your vacation and if you don\u2019t wanna be around kids you shouldn\u2019t have to especially on vacation. Bringing kids entirely changes the tone of the vacation for everyone.

The rest of them are free to do as they please. You can\u2019t stop your cousin from going. You can only exclude yourself from the trip. I think your mother caused this issue by running her mouth and blaming you for not wanting to be around the kids even though she feels the same way.", "You are NTA for wanting to have a nice vacation.", "Grab a Mai Tai, kick back and enjoy your vacation. You arent required to like your cousins kids or go on vacation with him. Your sister kinda has a right to be angry cause she (maybe) views the kids as NBD. \n\nNAH", "NAH.\n\nI get that sometimes kids can be annoying. The crying, the screaming, the misbehaving etc. I can\u2019t imagine relaxing while that\u2019s going on.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t label your cousin as an AH either for being invited to a vacation and bringing her children.", "You could compromise and say the cousin can come, but not the kids", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
