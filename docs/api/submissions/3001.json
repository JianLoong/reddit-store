The thing is 8 families, 28 people, all close friends, were up for it.  Everyone had kids.

Are you saying that OP should pay for her cousin's and not be able to enjoy her holiday OP'S parents don't want cousin there either.", "I'm the youngest but I'm also the drunkest so no one leaves their kid with me.", "And there you go. NTA\n\nI doubt you could force your sister to watch them because that would be a solution.", "Why tf does your sister want them to come", "That's more what I'm worried about. My cousin doesn't really look after her kids but honestly except for my sister, none of us really help. I just don't want the vibe of the vacation to be one that's \"family friendly.\" Her kids are extremely loud and expect to be entertained all the time and that just doesn't scream relax to me. We can go vacation under a train crossing if that's what we were aiming for.", "Lol, yeah she would have, you.\n\nNTA.", "So what stops sister and cousin from planning a vacation? Is it the babysitting they both want to impose on others?", "Welcome! \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f", "Why did I not think of this? Vacations to me were almost always synonymous with the ocean somehow. But I'm now consumed with mountains by a lake imagery of curling up in a good armchair in a cabin wrapped up in blankets and get lost in a good book sipping something hot. This is all I want! I just imagined trying to do this with toddlers around and it just doesn't work. I don't get your sister. I love kids too but I realize they are work and would not think less of someone if they don't want them on vacation.", "Then they really need to step up and not stay out of it and they shouldn't have put the decision on you.", "Did OP say that in a comment somewhere? I am not seeing that written in the post.\n\nEdit: you\u2019re right. Found the comments.", "Solid plan. And good call bailing if the cousin is there. Let her come! You can just have a staycation where you tell everybody you\u2019re going camping, then turn your phone off for 4 or 5 days.", "She freaking loves kids. It doesn't look like her and her husband are going to be able to have any of their own so she flies down to see my cousins kids a lot and always wants them to visit.", "Jokes on her. She has pulled this any time we are all around and besides my older sister no one really pays much attention to her kids.", "Haha probably.", "My sister actually adores the kids and she's the only one out of my family that helps her watch them. I wonder if they will plan their own vacation now. They actually probably might. LoL.", "\"Sister, our planned holiday wasn't suitable for small children, but I understand that you would like to go on holiday with cousin and her children. Why don't the two of you and the kids go on a child friendly vacation together. Obviously we'll miss you sister, but we understand how much being with cousin and her children means to you, and I'd never want to stop you from being with them.\"\n\nEven better if you get the rest of your family on side first before telling her that.", "She adores them, yet she seems unwilling to bring your cosuin and thus the children along if you don't come. So she clearly doesn't adore them enough to look after them. \n\nYour sister had basically planned to hijack this vacation, to turn it into a vacation for her, your cousin, and maybe others. With you as the sucker who gets stuck looking after the kids.", "I adore kids and you could not *pay me* to go on a vacation with my toddler niblings. \n\nYou deserve a peaceful vacation. If your sister and cousin want a vacay with the kids, they can plan their own kid-friendly trip.", "Cousin's kids are cousins...", "Then she can vacation with the kids and cousin separately lol", "So why is this even an issue? Even if you agreed, she still couldn\u2019t go.", "NTA    I wouldn't want to go on vacation with 2 toddlers either.\n\nI understand your sister wants them to go, but at the moment no one is being denied, or left out, because your cousin hasn't been invited yet. If your sister wants to go away with your cousin, and her kids that's fine, but this specific vacation is not the right time. \n\nCongratulations on graduating,  I hope all of your hard work brings you many successes.", "Oh my sister and cousin both know I won't watch the kids. LoL. They aren't quite that dumb.", "Haha you are totally right. Because of my sister's relationship with my cousin that's kind of how we all refer to them.", "Yeah technically but a lot of families refer to second cousins as niblings. My family does this. All my \u201caunts and uncles\u201d are actually my mom\u2019s cousins and my second cousins.", "I'm sure if I agreed my parents and my sister would chip in for her. I'm not sure if my middle sister would help out or not.", "Never heard of that. Live and learn!", "I\u2019m surprised your parents would have any interest in paying for the privilege of babysitting for a week. NTA.", "It's a bit of a long story but my oldest sister and cousin practically grew up together because my aunt and uncle were not the best parents in the world. She was over at our house a lot. As she has gotten older she has made a lot of um, questionable choices but her and my sister have remained extremely close even though my parents have taken a backseat to helping her. But she means a lot to my sister so I'm sure they would begrudgingly help if it came to it.", "The real problem here is your mom \"staying out of it\" when she asked you for your input, agreed, then said that cousin couldn't come, and then blamed you for the decision so she wouldn't have to deal with the drama. Your mom is totally the asshole here.", "I said this in another comment that to be fair, I have no idea what my mom told my sister. I would bet money that my mom told her some variation of \"we just want immediate family there\" and my sister just jumped to conclusions that I was the one behind it."]}
