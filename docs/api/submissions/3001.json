I have not been on holiday for a lot of years for various reasons.\n\nI have always wanted to go to Hawaii, I blame Magnum and Hawaii 5 O (the originals) and decided that I want to go there alone. Simply because I want this holiday to be for me, I don't want to do something just to please the person I am with, I don't want to miss out on anything either!\n\nAm I nervous, maybe a little but I am also excited.

My requirements for a vacation are comfy bed, AC/heat and bathroom facilities ideally attached to my room.", "That sounds lovely as long as it's indoors haha.", "NTA. You deserve a vacation that isn\u2019t flexed around child-friendly hours/activities/etc. Someone else\u2019s kids are not your problem, not even when it\u2019s family.", "Kids are a lot of work! As a mother I can tell you vacations with kids are never relaxing. They\u2019re constantly fighting, crying, screaming etc. It\u2019s an all around stressful situation. Mine thankfully are getting old enough that we might be able to enjoy it but they do still fight a lot. I understand the not bringing kids on vacation thing. lol NTA", "NTA. As a mom of a 6 and 2 year old, there's a reason we just don't go on vacation. It's not a vacation.", "NTA.  Your sister can go on vacation with your cousin, just the two of them (and her 2 toddlers).", "Absolutely NTA\n\n I\u2019m a mother of three. I can truthfully  tell you from years and years of experience that a vacation with little ones is drastically different than adults only \n\nA vacation with toddlers is about toddlers. Restricts the hotels you can stay at, what activities you do, where you can eat, your time table. Everything \n\nAnd that is even with the best behaved children in the world.", "NTA. My FIL called family vacations traveling with kids when my husband was little because it was more work than his job.", "Congratulations on graduating! You deserve a vacation! One without toddlers! Believe me when I say I know how hard it is to be in college working multiple jobs. It's not easy, but you did it! Now go take that well warned vacation away from kids, and the family (if you have to).", "NTA. An adult vacation and a child vacation are fundamentally different. Adding a toddler is going to change literally everything.", "NTA", "Love how your mom dropped you in it even though she felt the same way!\n\nNTA A holiday with toddlers is not something you need.", "NTA - It wasn't a kiddie holiday.  Your sister tried to change the rules.  Kids aren't welcome every time.", "NTA \nWhy was she even invited? Stick to just immediate family.  Who wants to deal with someone else's kids on vacation?", "NTA. People without children tend to enjoy vacations without children more. I am the youngest, so basically when my kids were young, my siblings kids were grown and they were free again. We had several \"sisters vacations\" where kids were not invited. I simply turned down the invite. This year they are doing a thanksgiving dinner, child free. I turned it down as well. No hard feelings, no arguing, just simple Im spending the holidays with my kids and grandkids.", "Idk why your sister wants to invite a cousin to what I assume was a immediate family vacation? Probably more to that, but NTA. However depending on what you are doing, she is going to have to watch her own kids so you may not seeing of her. But I wouldn\u2019t want a bunch of other people", "NTA. Your sister is", "I'm gonna go out on a limb and ask...when Cousin has been invited to past vacations or other events have all the activities had to be toned down for the children? I imagine this might largely be a consideration as to why OP doesn't want kids there. \n\nNTA", "Well, seems like I've got a very unpopular opinion to this...\n\nOP isn't an a*****e but perhaps too worried?\n\nI've got two \"Randalebr\u00e4ute\" (hard to translate, let us say it means ppl that let you think of \"escaping\" to a far away country without extradition agreement ^^) of my own and I absolutely agree that it's no vaccation, even if you call it that and pay the price for it when doing it with little kids.\n\nBut, some things are not clear for me \n\n1) where are you going? Sry, but that seems important to me. Going camping, absolute horror with the kids. Going to an all in resort, great - lots of places to go where the kids are not \n\n2) OP could just deny to \"babysit\" the kids. There are four other grown ups, let 'em toss a dime. \n\nI wouldn't deny myself a very much needed vacation 'cause of to kids.", "NTA. You don't want to be around small children on your vacation. I don't see anything about you telling them they had to cancel their trip, just that you wouldn't go if the kids were there.", "NTA-your mom also totally threw you under the bus \u2026. She agreed with you, but staying neutral???", "NTA. Had a family vacation with inlaws. Sister in law has <1yr and a tantrum prone 3yr. My wife and I regret going as we had little to no time to relax. Since we didn't have kids we got stuck sleeping on the couch in the main are of the hotel room. No privacy in the morning to wake up at our own pace. Couldn't go to sleep until everyone went to their own rooms either. It also cemented why my wife and I don't want kids.", "Nta.  If they didnt want your honest opinion they shouldnt have freakin asked you.  They just assumed you would knuckle under and say ok and didnt like it when u didnt.", "Your sister\u2019s probably pissed because she already invited your cousin.", "NTA and I'm a mom of 2, and if I was going kid free somewhere trying to relax I would also refuse to go if someone else was bringing their kids.", "NTA\n\nYour mom phrased it as your cousin couldn't come. YOU said you wouldn't come if your cousin came on the vacation. Which means she could have come, you just wouldn't have been part of it. I have to wonder if your sister would have been half as mad if you bailed on the vacation because of your cousin and her kids.", "Vacationing with small children is stressful but it\u2019s really bothering me that everyone is calling a four year old a \u201ctoddler\u201d. A four year old is 100% not a toddler.", "I find it nice. Our toddler is at his best behaviour when we are somewhere on vacation so it kinda is relaxing. But kids are different and  I can see the ingredients for nightmarish situations.", "I don't watch the kids and my cousin knows that but they are extremely clingy and needy so even if I'm not actively responsible for them they are still trying to hang off me. Every time they do I just take them back to my cousin but I don't want to do that all trip. Plus they are screamers.", "\u201cChildren are not inheritably a stress factor\u201d\n\nThey are to some people, like OP.

It would 100% not be possible if that wasn't a thing. I work 8-5 then do my school work at night and on the weekends. I teach for an hour Saturday mornings.", "I don't need to verify, I just know she would. The dad wouldn't take the kids for a whole week and she doesn't really have anyone else to ask and can't afford a babysitter for that long. Plus she is also kind of one of those people who believe everything should be child friendly.", "Thank you :)", "Luckily my sister hadn't invited her yet, thank goodness.", "I go to school online so I don't know any of them. LoL", "She doesn't have the money to fund the cousin and the kids on her own. My parents would have to chip in to help. I'm sure if my cousin was coming my sister and I would also lean on my other sister and I to chip in as well.", "It's kind of split in to two camps. My middle sister and parents don't have much to do with the kids and kind of carrying on but my eldest sister and cousin try and push and push. Plus the kids just aren't well behaved. They totally mess up the whole vibe.", "We are leaning towards a nice cabin in the woods because we are all really outdoorsy and like to hike but we also like to kick our feet up and drink. I just don't want them there, even if I'm not watching them. They aren't relaxing or fun to be around.", "Bet your sis wouldn\u2019t have be raging if your mom tried to explain it better or say she agrees with you", "not every family does this", "Are they not? I'm sorry. I am not a big kid person so I don't really know what the line is.", "Ah the side job is miniscule.", "So, did I get this straight: your sister wants to invite your cousin with kids and want all of you to pay for it?! But\u2026WHY?", "Just get on a certain list and you will never have to baby sit again! \n\nThats a joke.", "You're my hero! I'd take a mini vacation alone.  Last month I had a few extra days so I drove a few hours away and sat on a beach with a book.  Completely recharged me.  Good luck!", "No, toddlers toddle. A four year old is a preschooler. 1-2 year olds are toddlers.", "Just because you write zero four times and thrice in caps doesn't mean you're right", "Then you understand incorrectly. Which is rather surprising considering OP\u2019s comment was very clear.", "When I see the word *adulting* my mind immediately goes to stuff running errands and paying taxes lol.", "Depending on accommodations and travel they can still be toddlery, like loud and sticky.", "Honestly I just don't want them there, whether I'm responsible for them or not. Even if I'm not the one watching them, they tend to go from family member to family member just hanging all over them.", "Tell your oldest sister that she can invite your cousin if \n\n1. Either the kids stay with their dad, or \n2. *She* looks after the kids while the rest of you sip drinks by the pool. Preferably she will do so back home while your cousin gets a well-deserved break. \n\nThey are like sisters and she adores those kids kids after all.

That would be a better solution.", "Depends on your culture and native language. \n\nSwedish has different words for first cousins (*kusiner*), second cousins (*sysslingar*) and third cousins (*bryllingar*), so your fist cousins' children are referred to as just that (*kusinbarn*). \n\nWe also have a different word for each grandparent, and for maternal vs paternal uncles and aunts. And for your brother's sons and daughters vs your sister's.", "Type zero again", "To quote from Modern Family, \u201cif I\u2019m in the woods for 5 days it means I\u2019ve been dead for 4 of them.\u201d", "RIGHT?!

Roaches are nastier than beetles, bees and butterclies.", "Wow I can\u2019t believe how many people are bashing camping haha. I love to camp and backpack, nothing better than getting back in touch with our roots and appreciating the world around us that doesn\u2019t care about your job, your past, how much money you have, or what you look like. Honestly pure bliss. But that\u2019s fine, less filled campgrounds for me \ud83e\udd29", "Make that a gas fireplace, getting food delivered, reading, watching movies and/or binge watching tv and I\u2019m all for it. Keep the drinking as-is though. No need to hitch a ride for supplies as that\u2019s what Instacart is for. \n\nThat\u2019s my idea of a perfect camping get-away."]}
