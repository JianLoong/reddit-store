Close 2 preschool & big playground in the courtyard so I assumed its a child friendly place (Apparently not, weve had 2 anonymous noise complaints when he plays but its 3-5pm so not even during quiet hours?) Onto the problem: yesterday Sam & I wait in the lobby for the elevator. A woman is also waiting. Recently he saw KungFu Panda for the 1st time & is obsessed (Po for Halloween) pretends 2 karate chop everything 2 \u201csave China\u201d -hilarious. He never really hits anyone tho.\n\nSam runs up 2 her with a big \u201chiyah!\u201d & makes a karate pose, this lady just scowls at my kid. She scowls at me & turns away before I have the chance 2 even smile at her or anything. I catch up 2 Sam & he says something like \u201cI\u2019m Po! I know karate!\u201d trying 2 engage her & she just flat out ignores him. I\u2019m about 2 say something 2 her when Sam starts pretending 2 karate chop her legs, not even touching her, I pull him back. Not fast enough cuz Sam barely brushes her skirt & she snaps at him \u201cDONT TOUCH ME.\u201d Not a yell but really sharp & mean. I pull Sam close & tell him its ok & ask the woman whats her problem. She said \u201cIm not here to entertain your kid\u201d or smth like that, again really snappy tone! I\u2019m stunned at this point I\u2019ve never met someone so rude. I\u2019m not making Sam share an elevator with her (he wasn\u2019t crying but quietly staring/clearly uncomfortable) so I pick him up 2 carry him up the stairs. Then I say \u201cthere\u2019s no need to be such a B-I-T-C-H\u201d (spelled out) because honestly she needed to hear it. This woman whips her head around at me & I see her face go from angry to smug as she looks from me to my kid and back to me and loudly says \u201cB-I-T-C-H spells BITCH.\u201d (NOT spelled out!)\n\n3hrs later Sam has been echolaliating the Bword any time I dont have him distracted. \n\nShe did this to me on purpose.\n\n2hrs ago my fianc\u00e9 comes home, I tell him the story, first he just laughs at me like it isnt even a problem?? I dont see whats funny about speaking that way to a child or treating children so rudely, he said Sam isnt even effected by the incident and I\u2019m overreacting (if hes not effected maybe a magical fairy just came along and taught him that word?? Srsly!) Over the past 2 hours as Sam keeps saying Bword fianc\u00e9 has been going from not caring at all/laughing at me to being angry at me and BLAMING ME for \u201cteaching our son a bad word.\u201d We arent that household that thinks its cute when kids swear and all that trashy stuff. I admit I had a hand in this but I was only defending myself & my kid & I wasnt the one who was actually rude & teaching Sam bad words.\n\nI want 2 report her but Idk what suit shes in. there are cameras so maybe landlord could id her but fianc\u00e9 wants 2 drop it. Cant believe that this man isnt more protective of his family, his child was shouted at for playing & just being cute & he doesnt even care. Idk how he can be mad at me now when he acted like it was a joke before?

Maybe don't let you kid run up on people acting like he's about to hit them? Like, how can you think that's okay? And then calling her a bitch in front of your kid because she very reasonably acted negatively to that? Pretty crap example to set for your kid. Also, wtf do you think your actually even going to report her for?", "YTA while Sam sounds like a cutie, a lot of people aren\u2019t fans of kids and having one pretend to karate chop them would be annoying. \n\nKeep your child away from peoples personal space.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off, stranger danger. Stop assuming everyone is sweet and nice.\n\nSecond, it is no one's responsibility to play with your child. You and your kid would do well to learn boundaries and about respecting them.\n\nThird. You clearly saw she was uncomfortable and made no effort to vocally or quickly corral your child. \n\nI love kids. They are adorable. Not everyone does and even then, *hands to yourself* and *in your own space*. \n\nYou called her a name, expect to get shit back. You not only let that play out but started it then escalated it because you think everyone should cater to your child. Grow up.", "YTA\n\nThat poor woman is just minding her business waiting for the elevator and your son goes into ninja mode and starts karate chopping towards the woman and gets close enough to at least hit her clothes and the woman is the problem for telling him to stop attacking her?", "YTA. You need to start teaching your son about personal space. Many people are extremely uncomfortable with someone being that close to them. Also, you may think your son going around karate chopping people is the most adorable thing ever. Not everyone will think it's cute. People are going to get annoyed if he does stuff like that.", "Wow, YTA. And this coming from another mom with 4 boys, karate-chopping and everything :) \n\nI will let you in on a little secret but really try hard to understand what I'm telling you - your kids are not the most important people in the world. Teach them that. Repeat it to yourself at least once a day.", "YTA..firstly teach your kid not to touch people without their consent. This lady was minding her own business and your kid  was bothering her. She does not have to engage with anyone even if it's a child. Secondly you are the one who called her a bitch even if it was spelled out so whatever happened next is on you. What are you gonna report about her?", "Oh wow. YTA here for sure. I literally just said in another comment it's ok to not take yourself too seriously... but it's not ok to not respect others boundaries. A literal stranger to you didn't indulge your child so you spelled out a curse at her. She told your child what it spelled and now he keeps repeating it. Sounds like instant karma to me. \n\nHave you thought maybe why your child has been reported multiple times? Are they shrieking? Above normal kid levels? Acting actually violent where other parents can't utilize a shared space? Just wondering because you sound *super* entitled.", "YTA\n\nYour child wouldn\u2019t leave her alone/was taking swings at her and you weren\u2019t sufficiently watching him to pull him away. Your child is not her issue. And you called her a bitch and blamed HER for saying what you called her.\n\nThis is all on YOU. Your fiance is right.", "YTA! Your son is old enough to be taught not to run up to stranger, and should be taught this immediately. It may be a surprise to you but not everyone likes kids and wants them in their space. She was under absolutely no obligation to acknowledge or play with your son. I find her response hilarious!", "YTA\n\nBased on your actual description of the post you pulled him back so that he hardly touched her which meant that he WAS going to karate chop her as if invading her space in that way wasn't bad enough.\n\nYour son is old enough to learn appropriate decorum in public spaces around strangers. I live in a high rise and when there are kids waiting for the elevator or IN the elevator they keep to their own space and if not their parents are in control - no one is karate chopping anyone or invading spaces. The most that has occurred is when a parent asks if the child can push the buttons for the floors but they don't let the kid run amok at the buttons so they press all of them LOL", "YTA, nobody is required to indulge the things you think are adorable which your child does. People don't always like to be touched by strangers, adult or child, and you should respect that instead of starting some witch hunt to ease your bruised ego.", "YTA. People aren't obligated to indulge your kid. Also you said bitch first, spelt or not.", "Not everyone has to engage your child.  Not everyone likes kids. You might know that he isn\u2019t going to touch her, but she doesn\u2019t.  Sure, she didn\u2019t need to be snippy. But you over reacted.  YTA.", "YTA. Look, I get that 4 year olds are hyperactive little monkeys, but you can't let them run up and pretend to hit people who don't consent. Was her reaction a little rude? Yes. But you opened the B word can of worms yourself by swearing at her. And it was your own fault it backfired on you.", "YTA. \n\nTeach your child about personal space now. He touched a stranger without permission. Teach him to have the same consideration for others that he/you want for him.\n\nHow would you feel if she'd reached out and grabbed your son for a hug he didn't want because \"he's so adorable\"? I am sure you wouldn't like it a bit. Give others the same space and boundary courtesies.", "My job is working with kids and I would have not liked your kid doing that to me. I would have been annoyed. Sorry but you were in the wrong here. You should teach your child not to act out karate on other people. Maybe have him take an actual martial arts class because he'd learn some respect and that martial arts are for self defense. \n\nYta", "YTA - so this lady was clearly uncomfortable with your kid, and instead of ENGAGING WITH YOUR OWN KID to keep him from annoying a stranger, you let him continue until he started getting in her space and karate chopping at her legs.\n\nShe says \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d (which is a reasonable response to someone touching you), and you call her a bitch, but you think it\u2019s okay because you spelled it out? You don\u2019t get to call a stranger a bitch and then act all offended when she says the word. \n\nLmao at you \u201creporting\u201d her. Reporting her for what? Standing quietly? Telling a kid not to touch her when his mom wasn\u2019t doing anything about it? Saying \u201cthat spells bitch\u201d after you literally spelled out bitch at her.", "Why did you say \"What's your problem\" instead of \"I'm so sorry\"?\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m sure your kid is completely adorable but no one is required to be happy when a strange kid runs up to them and expects to play. You need to teach your kid not to approach people like that.\n\nAs for your kid now knowing the \u201cb\u201d word\u2026you\u2019re the one who went there first. This is on you.", "YTA. Defending your child against what exactly?? You\u2019re incensed because someone wouldn\u2019t indulge your kid\u2019s bratty behavior and your need to have everyone fawn over your child. Get past yourself.", "YTA put your kid on a leash if you can't parent them.", "Honestly, the entitlement here makes me suspect that the noise complaints about her kid were warranted. I'm going to guess that her kid playing was likely a lot louder than the OP was letting on. I'm thinking a set of pots and pans as drums?", "YTA. Control your child in public spaces. Also you are the one who called someone a bitch first. That is all on you and makes you double the asshole", "I have a 5 year old who currently thinks he\u2019s a ninja. Before that he was convinced he was a Jedi. He would and does try to \u201chi-ya\u201d people and hit them with his imaginary light saber. As his parent, it\u2019s my job to teach him to respect other peoples boundaries. I know he\u2019s little and he\u2019s still learning. You know what I do if I\u2019m not quick enough before he does something like your kid? I apologize and make sure he stands next to me. I don\u2019t call the person that was bothered by my kid a bitch. \n\nYTA", "Yea YTA, even more so for thinking you should report her (to who?) not everyone likes kids and you should be teaching him not to approach strangers period, but they\u2019re not there for him to \u201cplay with\u201d. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around your 4 yr old. Her response was perfectly normal, even if it was a bit harsh sounding to you. Teach your kid a little better where manners and acceptable behaviors are concerned, as he\u2019s getting old enough to understand those concepts better. And your SO is right, drop it and keep explaining to your son that the word he is repeating is a \u201cbad word\u201d or however you choose to correct it.", "**YTA** in a public area you need to have your child under control which clearly you did not, 2ndly, if you didn't want her to say it then you shouldn't have spelled it out for her in the first place, and last, i honestly would have done the same thing. you started the attitude by asking her what the hell her problem was, her problem was you not having your munchkin under control in the public area and treating her like she was the problem.\n\nkids are similar to pets in the sense that, you have to teach them to behave in public because the world doesn't revolve around them nor does the world think they are special, only you think they are special because they are yours and not everyone feels this way. if they break something, you are liable to pay for it. if they make a mess, you are the one responsible to clean it up.", "YTA obviously and she didn't do anything you can report her for.\n\nThis is all stemmed from you not controlling your child.", "YTA", "I have 4 adult kids.  I love little kids.  I think little kids are adorable.  I often think they are adorable when they are (mildly) misbehaving and making their *responsible* parents crazy, the ones trying to keep them in line, quiet, and behaving in public.  I smile at them, and tell them they learn, it gets better, they are doing fine.\n\nI\u2019d also have been angry and disgusted with your ineffective parenting and your child being out of control.  Not the kid\u2019s fault, it\u2019s a lack of proper teaching.  I read this aloud to my husband and daughter.  Much laughter, at the neighbor\u2019s PERFECT petty revenge.  We all agree.  You deserved it. Your fianc\u00e9 is right.  It\u2019s your fault, you brought this onto yourself, step up and teach your son better.  YTA", ">weve had 2 anonymous noise complaints when he plays but its 3-5pm so not even during quiet hours?\n\nI have a feeling those noise complaints were entirely warranted,  considering that you think it's OK for your kid to try and use strangers as punching bags.", "This one is on you. People don't have to engage with kids. She didn't touch him or anything, just set a clear boundary. And that is OK. And then you basically called her a bitch. Because in your eyes she didn't have the right to choose whether to interact with you or not. I'm not like her because I like kids, but her response was totally badass. If you don't want your son to call someone a bitch, then don't do it yourself - no matter how you do it. And you want to report her? For what? For not wanting to interact with you and your son? For repeating what you called her?", "YTA. Your kid has zero right to invade someone else\u2019s space.", "YTA ~ not everyone thinks your kid is as cute as you do", "YTA big time. Uncoordinated child practicing fake karate moves on strangers and you have the gall to think the women being bothered is the issue? If it was me, your child would have learned worse words after your little entitled parent outburst. \n\nShe was not being rude at all asking the child to not touch her. In fact, if anyone in the story has a valid complaint for the landlord - it\u2019s her. You let your child bother her repeatedly and then went nuts when she asked to not be touched. How do you think your the victim here? \n\nStrangers are not your child\u2019s play things. Teach you kid some boundaries. \n\nYou have no idea how that persons day is going or if they are going to have a reaction to someone trying to hit them. They may have an injury they are protective of. Even if it\u2019s a kid - reflexes are weird, especially if a person has past trauma regarding violence or is trying to protect an injury.", "YTA. Not everyone likes kids, and not everyone wants to engage with them. You don't know what her situation is. Maybe she's lost a child. Maybe she's barren. Maybe she had a child kidnapped. Or she just doesn't like kids. Your son should be taught not to run up on strangers like that. You spelled her out of her name, so she just evened it. You should have just apologized, and walked off.", "YTA. \n\nGet your child's behavior under control. Not everyone thinks your kid is cute or wants to smile or engage with your kid. Most people don't want to deal with a preschooler running around pretending to karate chop people. \n\nAnd report her for what? You called her a name. She repeated the name. She isn't responsible for your child's behavior or language.", "YTA. She obviously didn't find your kids cute. Missed an opportunity to teach him to act right in public.", "YTA. Just cause you think your kid is cute does not mean anyone else has to. Learn to parent", "YTA. You chose to have a kid. Other people out in the world just living their lives are not responsible for entertaining your child and have no obligation to interact with them at all. You called a woman a bitch because she didn\u2019t want your son treating her legs like a toy.\n\nYou should probably just parent your kid and teach him not to run up and try to play with strangers.\n\nEdit: omg I just went back and read the part where you want to report her. You can\u2019t report a woman for wanting her personal space respected.", "YTA your kid shouldn\u2019t be acting out karate like that in public", "YTA you want to report her for what? Not being a playmate to your kid? Not everyone enjoys kids running around all over the place. Besides, despite her displeasure she didn't insult you, you insulted her for no reason. Parents always think that their own kid(s) are the most adorable creatures in the galaxy but realistically a large number of people don't share this sentiment.", "YTA Why would you report the other woman? She might be a sourpuss, but is there a law against using mildly bad language round your way?  \n\n\nI've no doubt that your little boy is very cute, but not everyone likes little kids getting in their way - which your kid clearly was if he 'barely brushes her skirt'. I'm sure your son is lovely, but you can't expect all other people to see things your way.", "YTA. You need to teach your child it\u2019s not ok to even pretend to attack others, unless he\u2019s in karate class. You definitely escalated the situation by using the B word with your neighbor. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re thinking of reporting her to the landlord.", "YTA???? Dude I have a four year old too and it\u2019s wild that you thought this was fine? Teach your kid about personal space. Nobody owes your child play and people are in fact allowed to have clear and stern boundaries with our children.", "YTA \nI love kids and will happily indulge their imaginations for hours BUT if a child came running at my legs with what looks like the intention to karate chop them I would also be screaming don't touch me.\n\nI have arthritis in both knees and even on a good day a light touch in the wrong place could put me on the floor with very little chance of getting up.\n\nYou have no idea of the woman history's with children, her health or  any of the factors that could affect her reaction to your child.", "Jesus Christ, how do you not see you\u2019re the issue here? Your kids went up and pretended TO HIT someone. And you did nothing! You had no control over your kid. She did nothing wrong, and I would not have been as calm as she was. \n\nYou are like those people who let their dog off leash and run up to everyone growling because \u201che\u2019s friendly and would NEVER bite anyone\u201d. \n\nHow dare you? YTA", "YTA \n\nBoth you and your kid should educate yourselves, learn social etiquette, and establish proper boundaries- especially with strangers who may want nothing to do with your child. Even if you find his behavior adorable in public, it can be seen as highly inappropriate in situations where other people's boundaries are disrespected. \n\nGoing further to insult the person that was defending their space after numerous chances via disengagment (probably hoping you were going to collect them [your kid]?) is counterintuitive, turning what had the potential to be a teaching moment sour. Her reaction wasn't needed, but tbh I'd 100% do the same in a shitty mood and constantly bothered.\n\nIn the end, you weren't defending your child. You were upset that the other person refused to tolerate/entertain your child's inappropriate behavior- especially so with a stranger.\n\n\nThis is not to compare dogs to children. Just a good analogy for the situation:\n\nYou're walking your small dog in a park while leashed. Your small dog doesn't always enjoy the company of other dogs, but loves the ability to sniff and explore parks. You allow this to happen safely by keeping your space away from other people owning dogs, and having your own dog remaining leashed. A large boisterous dog bolts over offleash, jumping, mouthing, slobbering, and trying to treat your dog and your space like a fun squeaky toy. The dog doesn't seem to have bad intentions, and merely finds you entertaining. But now, here you are, upset, holding your small dog over your head, and screaming for the owner to come and leash their dog. Instead of remedying the encounter, they make eye contact, smile, and say \"Oh! He's just being friendly!\" Your dog doesn't feel the same sentiment. Neither do you. Now, both yours and his time out and relaxing has been tarnished. The owner may find his dogs behavior adorable, but clearly you do not, and wanted to keep your personal bubble sealed. If this scenario was replayed, it might've turned out better if the large dog owner asked permission to come over and play, the dogs may have gotten along, or mayhaps not.\n\n^^^The key to this story is consent and personal space. \n\nThe person did not consent to your child invading their personal space. Just as the small dog owner did not consent to the large dog coming into their space.\n\nTeaching your child to ask permission before engaging in play and substituting impolite behaviors for socially polite behaviors will help model their future social skills, especially so going into grade schools. I don't think you were malicious with your child acting like a child, just misguided in your reaction. \n\nUse this encounter as an educational moment and do better for the both of you.  :)", "YTA. Even though you think it is adorable, everyone else will not. You handled it badly and escalated, when should have just walked away. I don't think you building manager would care that someone was rude to you, so I do not know why you think you should report her.", "YTA and also an entitled parent who thinks everyone should be their free babysitter and playmate for their wild kid", "YTA so your child almost hit the lady. The only reason he didn\u2019t is because you had to pull him away. Not once did you get him to apologise. I understand he\u2019s two, but he can still see it being used in a social setting. He may not get it straight away but they will.", "I don\u2019t think you will get the response you were hoping for. You let him go to far & got a reaction that you didn\u2019t like. But I would imagine she didn\u2019t like what was happening either & his parent (you)  didn\u2019t do enough to control him. You are going to have to be accountable for what your son does and in this instant both you and your son were in the wrong.", "YTA. Your kid is pulling up just short of assaulting random people. One day he's going to miss time that an hit someone. Likely he has already and you are just laughing it off and encouraging him to attack more people.

Now you're fiance is mad because your kid learned the word you used against the lady your child assaulted. Sorry, 'pretend' assaulted. Like that's much better. You weren't protecting your child from anything but the consequences of his own actions, which you should have been on top of. You should have been the one yelling at him, then he wouldn't know this new delightful word. Now you want to get the lady your kid assaulted in trouble?

Close 2 preschool & big playground in the courtyard so I assumed its a child friendly place (Apparently not, weve had 2 anonymous noise complaints when he plays but its 3-5pm so not even during quiet hours?) Onto the problem: yesterday Sam & I wait in the lobby for the elevator. A woman is also waiting. Recently he saw KungFu Panda for the 1st time & is obsessed (Po for Halloween) pretends 2 karate chop everything 2 \u201csave China\u201d -hilarious. He never really hits anyone tho.\n\nSam runs up 2 her with a big \u201chiyah!\u201d & makes a karate pose, this lady just scowls at my kid. She scowls at me & turns away before I have the chance 2 even smile at her or anything. I catch up 2 Sam & he says something like \u201cI\u2019m Po! I know karate!\u201d trying 2 engage her & she just flat out ignores him. I\u2019m about 2 say something 2 her when Sam starts pretending 2 karate chop her legs, not even touching her, I pull him back. Not fast enough cuz Sam barely brushes her skirt & she snaps at him \u201cDONT TOUCH ME.\u201d Not a yell but really sharp & mean. I pull Sam close & tell him its ok & ask the woman whats her problem. She said \u201cIm not here to entertain your kid\u201d or smth like that, again really snappy tone! I\u2019m stunned at this point I\u2019ve never met someone so rude. I\u2019m not making Sam share an elevator with her (he wasn\u2019t crying but quietly staring/clearly uncomfortable) so I pick him up 2 carry him up the stairs. Then I say \u201cthere\u2019s no need to be such a B-I-T-C-H\u201d (spelled out) because honestly she needed to hear it. This woman whips her head around at me & I see her face go from angry to smug as she looks from me to my kid and back to me and loudly says \u201cB-I-T-C-H spells BITCH.\u201d (NOT spelled out!)\n\n3hrs later Sam has been echolaliating the Bword any time I dont have him distracted. \n\nShe did this to me on purpose.\n\n2hrs ago my fianc\u00e9 comes home, I tell him the story, first he just laughs at me like it isnt even a problem?? I dont see whats funny about speaking that way to a child or treating children so rudely, he said Sam isnt even effected by the incident and I\u2019m overreacting (if hes not effected maybe a magical fairy just came along and taught him that word?? Srsly!) Over the past 2 hours as Sam keeps saying Bword fianc\u00e9 has been going from not caring at all/laughing at me to being angry at me and BLAMING ME for \u201cteaching our son a bad word.\u201d We arent that household that thinks its cute when kids swear and all that trashy stuff. I admit I had a hand in this but I was only defending myself & my kid & I wasnt the one who was actually rude & teaching Sam bad words.\n\nI want 2 report her but Idk what suit shes in. there are cameras so maybe landlord could id her but fianc\u00e9 wants 2 drop it. Cant believe that this man isnt more protective of his family, his child was shouted at for playing & just being cute & he doesnt even care. Idk how he can be mad at me now when he acted like it was a joke before? Am I crazy/the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
