They love that place because it\u2019s where they met and has tons of sentimental meaning to them. They also hired my 18 year old brother to work there because they want him to have job experience before going off to college. They didn\u2019t offer to hire me, and I didn\u2019t ask because I already have a fast food job. \n\nAnyway, my house is pretty close to the shop, and my friends and I decided to meet up there yesterday for icecream and to hang out. For reference, we\u2019re a group of four high schoolers. It was pretty busy, so we got in line. About a minute in, we brother came out of the back and waved me over. He handed me an apron and asked me to help out his coworker in the back because they had to clean the machines ASAP but my brother had to open a second register because of how busy it was. \n\nI refused on the grounds that I wasn\u2019t being paid, and he said that I had to help out because it\u2019s the \u201cfamily business\u201d and because of how swamped the place was and how panicked his coworker was. He even offered to let my friends skip the line if I helped out for ten minutes to give his coworker a hand, and said I owed it to him to help out because I \u201cbrought such a big group in\u201d. I decided that that would cause a scene in a packed shop, and refused again. He huffed and waved me off, then went to open the second register. \n\nI went back to my friends and the rest of our meet up went well, but my brother kept giving me dirty looks until we got our cones and left. \n\nLater that night, my parents confronted me and said that what I did was petty. They told me to work a shift the next day to make up for it, but backed off once I reminded them that I have an actual job that I was scheduled to work pretty much all day the next day. \n\nI ended up getting off scot free, however my whole family maintains that I\u2019m petty and lazy, and now I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re right.

Holy f\\*ck this is one of the most black and white situations I've ever seen.  If brother was just working to support the business (not taking salary) then I can see how your family could expect you to step up and contribute.  But he gets paid and your family expect you to work for free?  I think slavery was abolished what, 200 years ago?", "NTA - you were there to give them money you earned from your real job. You were a customer.  It should be fair treatment. If your brother is paid, you should be paid. You are not a slave.", "They just taught you not to go to that shop or you will get commandeered. Your brother had no business telling you to get to work when you are with your friends on your free time.

Hopefully that reminder that actually you already have a job was enough for them to respect you don't work for them", "NTA \n\nYou're right that you shouldn't be expected to perform work without being paid or being an employee.

You were with friends. To expect you to immediately hop to and pitch in was unreasonable.\n\nYou didn\u2019t get off scot-free - your brother did. He had no right to demand that and to continue to hold it against you. Perhaps if he\u2019d asked you for ten minutes of your help and time in the first place in exchange for ice creams for your friends instead of simply handing you an apron, you might have helped out.

Do you technically have to help out? No, I guess. But does it make you the AH to refuse to help your brother for 10 MINUTES at your family's business? YES.

Would helping out your brother for 10 minutes have been such a big deal? However, he should have asked you, not handed you an apron and assuming you\u2019d help, that\u2019s where he sucked.

That\u2019s not how businesses work !!", "NTA", "NTA.yes, you there because you want to hangout with your friends not to became a labour on your family bussiness.", "NTA\n\nYou did your brother and your parents a favor. If he is doing this for job experience, it\u2019s important to learn that you can\u2019t expect unpaid workers to jump in and save you if you can\u2019t handle it. He sounds well on his way to being the kind of manager who would expect people to come in on scheduled vacation days because he messed up. \n\nAnd telling you that it\u2019s your fault for bringing in so many customers? What is that about? As if bringing in business is a bad thing. He needs to adjust his attitude really quickly. \n\nFinally, as many people have mentioned, it would be a huge liability to work there untrained and unpaid as well, for reasons that include health code violations, labor laws, and liability.", "This whole thing is really hard to buy - seems like contrived BS. \n\nSimply enough, a restaurant becomes and ice cream shop.

Government fines, medical bills, etc. It\u2019s not worth the risk for you or them. \n5) They should\u2019ve covered when it got busy. And they need to hire more employees AND be ready to step up. \n\nAnd don\u2019t tell them this, but my advice to you is to never set foot in there again. You don\u2019t need their lack of planning and subsequent drama to ruin your day.", "NTA.  No pay, no work. \n\nThat's also probably a health code violation.", "INFO: were your parents available at all? If they were, I would say NTA .

Sounds petty and lazy to me. Helping your family out for 10 minutes is not a lot to ask. Personally, i think that if you have a good relationship with your family, your brother shouldn\u2019t have even had to ask. And while not being paid seems to be a concern, I\u2019d like to know if you pay rent and buy your own food. Family is give and take.", "This is a \"technically NTA\" for me. You were still petty af, we're talking ten minutes of helping your brother. You definitely chose not to be kind. Your brother should have offered to pay you of course, either by convincing your parents to do it, or taking it out of his own pocket since this was his idea. But man I'm glad you're not my sister, and I've wanted a sister my whole life.", "Absolutely NTA and downvoting every bootlicking blowhard saying otherwise. Expecting unpaid labor from someone who isn't even employed there is not only unethical and almost certainly illegal - more bluntly, it's just unadulterated theft of your labor for ultimately commercial benefit, and \"uh uh family reeeee\" is just the topical anesthetic to avoid having to admit that this conflict of interests is supposed to just be taken for granted in your parents' favor. It's also a huge liability. What would your parents have done if you had complied, gone into the back, and then been injured because you and the other guy were being hurried? Covered that up too? Ignored the L&I report that they would have been required to file if you were a real employee? Pretended that it was ok because \"it was for family\"?\n\nLook, you're gonna spend your entire adult life having various employers and other people trying to get you to spend time, money, risk, and effort without paying you. Moreso because you're a woman/femme and your resources/skills will often be outright devalued because of a passive assumption throughout society that any work that women can do is de facto easy enough to justify paying less for it as well.\n\n\"It's an emergency!\" and \"This office is a family\" is more of the same - a cynical power trip by business owners to try to shame you into forfeiting your own boundaries as a person for the benefit of their own financial interests, laundered as being \"the company's interests\" to make it sound loftier and more abstract than it actually is. That compulsion doesn't go away just because \"we're family\" is literally true, and you know firsthand that it's actually even stronger in that case, or you wouldn't be here asking if you should feel guilty for recognizing it as a scam from people who should have \\*far\\* more concern for your rights and your immediate and future wellbeing than do random strangers on Reddit.\n\nI think you know perfectly well that it never would have been \"just ten minutes,\" or just the one time thing. You deserve to be commended for drawing a hard line for yourself now. You're going to spend the next 50+ years having to do it again and again so you might as well get in the habit.", "This is so wild to me. I grew up in a family restaurant where my friends came to eat all the time, and usually for free\u2026 and I can\u2019t imagine coming to work on a day off and seeing my family swamped and not jumping in to help. Like that\u2019s so far beyond the pale to me. But I love my family and we look out for each other without every kindness being transactional. I can\u2019t believe people are actually like this. I\u2019m so glad I have the big messy family that I have, and not a family like this. How cold and petty and soulless. How sad. How terribly sad.", "Seeeee parents own a business and they are always there and some siblings work there and if they called me and we\u2019re swamped n needed my help I would help and if I\u2019m with my friends guess what you guys can join me to assist until they can manage themselves but if my parents are not even at the family business assisting and they are just lounging nah fam. I woulda told my brother to call them. But also if your parents business goes down and they run out of money. I\u2019m sure you would be pretty upset that you have to go provide for yourself. All I can say is be grateful and help out even if you are not getting paid. I\u2019m sure they provide other stuff for you around the house or for your life to be pretty comfortable.", "YTA not because you were expected to work for free. That is not OK and you should get paid like everyone else. But you left your brother and the coworker in a bad situation which you could have solved with 10 minutes of your time. \n\nYou even said the worker panicked. It is a business under new owner ship. The place was packed. Things can get bumpy in this situation and you could really have shown compassion to your brother, the family and the coworker. \nInstead you choose to make a stand. That's fully in your right. Still makes you the AH here. \n\nMaybe NTA if you continually are refused payment.", "Well you are definitely pretty. There seems to be missing background/context as most families or friends would step up for ten minutes to help out and there was even a reciprocal element to his offer ( letting you skip line for ten minutes of work?", "YTA, it is a family business, and your brother was asking for help not for you to work there all day. \n\nYou could have easily helped your family. \n\nI don't understand why everyone is saying NTA because it's not like he was asking you to work for free everyday, he asked for help and instead of helping you gave him the excuse of \"I'm not getting paid\".\n\nI know it wasn't a great time because you were with friends but your brother needed you for 30 mins? You could have easily said, \"Yeah, sure, I'll help for a bit, but I'm meeting friends, so I have to go after the hour.\" That would have shown you cared, helped your brother/family, and also you wouldn't be in this mess.\n\nYou should have been considerate. He needed you, and you blew him off. In life, people will come and go, (usually) family tends to be there for one another. Know your family knows you will only help them if there is something to gain and not just out of kindness.", "YTA and you know it, you just want the reddit hive mind to validate your self centered bullshit.", "YTA here. When did helping out family become so transactional? Your brother was in need so he asked for your help. He assumed you had his back which is why he handed you the apron. You decided to be petty and show him you still have a lot of growing up to do. You could have negotiated afterward with your family on pay if it really was that important to you.", "YTA.  If it was a regular thing or for hours at a time, sure, definitely refuse and N T A .  Helping out a sibling for 10 minutes one time when they are panicked is not a huge ask.  It seems exactly the kind of thing a family would do.", "Hope you never need help in an unexpected tight spot.

How can they call you lazy  when you have your own paid job? Also, we're your parents at the shop working too?\n\nEdit: I see they took a vacation day from their office jobs and didn't work at the shop. Your parents are AH for buying a passion project shop and essentially leaving an untrained teenager to run it (because that's what I think they wanted your brother working there for) and still wanting you to be unpaid labor. \n\nIf they don't want to spend the time at the 'family business' they shouldn't expect you to be there either.", "NTA. Your brother is an ass", "NTA\n\nGreat way to invest money: In a business that went bankrupt.\n\nAnd how they plan on being successful? By having OP as free employee.\n\nAnd is this your brother's only job ever? If so, how are you lazy if you have a job you got on your own?", "NTA.\n\nI often think one of the reasons many small businesses fail is because they do not draft business plan with projected employee costs, or if they are, they seem to be VASTLY underestimating their employee costs by:\n1. Relying on unpaid family. \n2. Underpaying the employees they do hire. \n3. Under-hiring.\n4. Paying excessive overtime due to frequent double shifts as there are not enough employees. \n5. Not accounting for the costs associated with low pay and low staffing (low morale/ high turnover = frequent hiring, training, etc, rinse and repeat).\n\nIt is not a long- term recipe for business success to rely on unpaid or underpaid labor. They call it \"helping out family,\" but in terms of building a business, it is building on a weak foundation. They are building in a certain cost point expectation that will most definitely disappear, and depending on how integral that free/ cheap labor is to their business budget, it could be the crumbling pillar that destroys the business when it falls out from beneath them.", "YTA\n\nMaybe we just have a different view on family and life.

I dont know how people say NTA. See your brother asked for an help he didn\u2019t ask you to work fully. I know you can refuse to help but jesus thats your family business thats how you get to afford living under a roof and eat lavishly while working part time job to fund for your spendings. These white people amuse me on how much little they care about their family. Its not like he asked you to work daily without pay. The situation was worse and he didn\u2019t expect this and he asked for a help and even gave you a offer. Op and some people thinking that you shouldn\u2019t help family during tough times astonish me.", "If that shop puts a roof over your head and your parents love it, YTA for not stepping up. Imagine how hurt your parents must have felt. Have they ever done more for you than was necessary just to help you or make you happy?", "YTA, although your parents are also TA.  This is a family business and if it is successful you all stand to benefit.  Giving 10 minutes of your time would not have killed you and the appreciation of your Brother would have been payback.  Yes, if it became a regular thing then I get that you would need to have some payment sorted out.  Your parents are also TA because it feels like they bought the business and now expect to sit back and reap the rewards without putting in the work.  Starting a business is always difficult but once established and starts to make a profit then they can employ new people. I feel for your Brother right now.", "YTA you could have helped your brother for 10 minutes, you\u2019d probably have got some free ice cream for it", "Technically, NTA, thats also why you didn't got punished in the end. \n\nBut you now set the rule, that you will only help out family, if you get paid (i mean come on, they asked you to help them out for 10mins, they didn't asked you to help out a whole day for free). Just don't be surprised when now every time you ask your family to lend you a hand, they will tell you as long you are not paying them, they won't. I think you underestimate the long term damage you did to your relationship with your family - and its kind of the worst kind of damage, its not big enough for them to be upset but there will be a underlying irritation now. \n\nYk what i mean? Like if a friend says or does smthg that irritates you, but its not bad enough to get upset or even be openly annoyed, but it changes the way you look at them long term - like you got a glimpse at their true colors. You still like the friend very much, but you suddenly notice their bad flaws more than before. \n\nI would consider to apologize, even if you were technically right. You are young and so are a lot of commentors here - you may didn't learnt yet that sometimes, when it comes to the big picture of important relationships, being right is not always what matters and you should chose very carefully what hills you want to die on - the consequences could be harder and lasting longer than you think. \n\nOh, btw, its kind of obvious in your post that you are bitter your parents didn't offer you a job (and maybe they had good intentions like they know that working in a family business will not be as highly rewarded as another job). And i think this is the main reason you acted like you did. Talk to your parents about it instead of resenting your brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They love that place because it\u2019s where they met and has tons of sentimental meaning to them. They also hired my 18 year old brother to work there because they want him to have job experience before going off to college.

For reference, we\u2019re a group of four high schoolers. It was pretty busy, so we got in line. About a minute in, we brother came out of the back and waved me over. He handed me an apron and asked me to help out his coworker in the back because they had to clean the machines ASAP but my brother had to open a second register because of how busy it was. \n\nI refused on the grounds that I wasn\u2019t being paid, and he said that I had to help out because it\u2019s the \u201cfamily business\u201d and because of how swamped the place was and how panicked his coworker was. He even offered to let my friends skip the line if I helped out for ten minutes to give his coworker a hand, and said I owed it to him to help out because I \u201cbrought such a big group in\u201d. I decided that that would cause a scene in a packed shop, and refused again. He huffed and waved me off, then went to open the second register. \n\nI went back to my friends and the rest of our meet up went well, but my brother kept giving me dirty looks until we got our cones and left. \n\nLater that night, my parents confronted me and said that what I did was petty. They told me to work a shift the next day to make up for it, but backed off once I reminded them that I have an actual job that I was scheduled to work pretty much all day the next day. \n\nI ended up getting off scot free, however my whole family maintains that I\u2019m petty and lazy, and now I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re right.

Pressure is when mistakes happen and then everyone is like \"you're only supposed to wash them with water from the tap on the side, sink water is too hot and you broke it / you can't touch that part now you're hurt and we have to go to the ER and close for the day!!!\" even though they never bothered to teach you where stuff was or how to be safe.", "That's doing something good out of your own heart. Great! OP did not want to do that. That's no more morally wrong than jumping behind the bar. They're both alright choices. \n\nMy concern moreso is that OP was in a position of like unequitable risk and responsibility. It's not really the same as helping a friend out or even chores when its basically a demand you start working for free, 0 training on how the place runs in a rush. Ice cream machines are SO expensive and just using the wrong temperature water can destroy them. You could probably pay your friend back if you busted a glass or a bottle or scalded a pan if you were in the back, and you likely didn't need their approval of your actions to have somewhere to sleep at night. Big decisions like that need agreements from everyone and OP's best case scenario was \"nothing bad happens and I've wasted the time I wanted to see with my friends.\" Worst is a lot worse!", "You MIGHT be one of the parents or the brother", "Don't even bother, reddit is such a selfish place. \n\nYou're right, Family should help family. She wasn't paid because she was asked by her brother, who is not the owner and because it was only for a few minutes. \n\nReading these, i suspect AITA is full of teenagers or people who live alone in a basement.", "He. The brother. If he tried to ask a non employee to do unpaid work at any other business,  that business would be in trouble if caught.", "I think 10 minutes helping when you're actually with friends is  quite a big deal. NTA at all.", "You think the point in Reddit is to argue? Hoo boy. Maybe go outside for a little while.", "because he said, so doesn\u2019t make it true. In cases like that 10 minutes is not 10 minutes one thing after another will come up.\n\nIn another comment OP said that brother has a history of taking advantage of her help. so no 10 minutes would not have just been 10 minutes.", "That'll be why I suggested reading the comments.", "And it would not be the only time he's ask for help. Helping him now would have set a precedent for future instances where the brother needs help.", "3) Ok we can agree that that was a bad wording. I would cut the brother some slack in that situation. \n\n2) I don't think there is a common standard for asshole. And I would evaluate this kind of petty behavior as asshole-ish.", "Be assured I am not. I just have a different opinion than the majority here and some time at work to argue for it. But I have to go now, which is probably better for my karma count \ud83d\ude00", "I have time on my hands to argue for my opinion. I don't mind being downvoted. Who cares for magical internet points. \n\nBut I have to admit that I am really a little bit confused whether my moral compass is that of.", "They were at the back of the line they wanted help with, though. All OP leaving would have done by helping is got them ice cream faster. If you think 10 mins is a big deal to your friends, you are clearly still young.", "So OP couldn't have said: \"10 minutes are up, I did what you asked\"?", "and I did, haha. Thank you for pointing it out :)", "She also states in comments that her brother has a history of taking advantage of her \u201chelp\u201d which further solidifies NOT helping because it likely was not going to be \u201cjust 10 mins\u201d", "3) fair enough, as I said I don\u2019t know if it was malicious so we can give him the benefit of the doubt \n\n2) agree to disagree I guess, I think she\u2019s NTA", "Teaching kids that unpaid labor is expected and the norm is wrong in my opinion. \n\nMy kids always get free food at my restaurant and I don't make them \"work it off\"\n\nMy kids get paid for their time and get trained properly.\n\nIf anything...maybe a few details are left out of this post, but for the information given...I'm glad OP stood her ground on the situation.", "Lets for a second imagine it actually would have been just 10 minutes; despite the vast majority of \"oh its just 10 minutes\" ending up being substantially more in reality.\n\nA) Lets look at this on a professionalism basis; a Worker walks up to a Customer queing and starts demanding they do work if they want icecream quicker and to skip over every other customer in the queue.  \nThis is well the opposite of running a professional buisness and how many stay in buisness long term when such practices are normalised.\n\nB) Lets look at this on a family basis then. The very surface level claim of \"oh help out your family\" is often used solely by family members that are actually selfish. Its substantially more nuanced. If a family member is out with friends: doing their own thing; has not agreed beforehand and its not an actual emergency. How is family trying to demand they drop what they are doing and their life in anyway a healthy family relationship. You can ask sure but a no is a perfectly valid response here. Boundaries are important especially in familial relationships that you want to last for decades.\n\nC) 10 mins a big deal lol must be young. Thats such a dumb take that frankly I have to wonder do you have friends? A lot can happen in 10 mins. Hell a lot can happen beforehand that make said 10 mins actually important to their friends. An easy example here is a best friend in an abusibe situation; trying to have a good day out with the few people they can trust and rely on; perhaps its the one that organised it and seeing themselves get pushed to the side after everyone agreed to hang out for something inconsequential has an actual impact. 10 minutes is always important. Its only unimportant if you live a life of emptiness and refusing to consider anything else.\nNow OP hasnt mentioned this is the case; but also the family has 0 idea at the time. You have 0 idea. I have 0 idea. Hell OP may even have 0 idea. \n\n\nThis was not an emergency; these things almost never are just 10 mins; there was no prior emergency; this is just a family that views someone else as just something to use when needed without care for that persons own circumstances. Just look at how the family tried to force a full unpaid shift on the OP when said OP has a full day of work at the same time. Shows how little the family is actually paying attention to the OPs real obligations \n\nOP isnt an asshole; the family need to learn boundaries and how to handle actual relationships if they want a familial relationship to last through the decades.", "and then brother would be pushing her for more and then that would cause the drama that we\u2019re seeing right now. \n\nThere\u2019s also a shit ton of issues that come with working unpaid and when you\u2019re not an actual employee. Family business or not they still have to follow labor laws.", "Why do you think that boundary would be respected any more than \"I'm not paid, not trained, so I'm not working\"?", "2) Happy with that and I will leave the discussion before being downvoted into oblivion - since I am clearly not with the majority opinion here. \n\nBut let me say: thanks for the fun and civil discussion."]}
