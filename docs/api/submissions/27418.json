My wife (F30) and my SIL have been very good friends since they first met. They regularly meet up without me and my brother. I love the fact they are friends. We also meet up all together and we all get on well.\n\nI suspected my wife was cheating on me. Long story short, this was confirmed with loads of evidence. I confronted my wife and she confessed. We are going through therapy.\n\nSome of the evidence I found was on my wife's phone. While looking for evidence, I found messages between my wife and SIL. The messages show my SIL knew about the affair for months. In the messages she empathised with my wife. She said she would understand if my wife left me. She didn't exactly tell my wife off for cheating. My SIL didn't tell me. I didn't get any \"anonymous tips\" or hints or anything.\n\nShe didn't help my wife cover her tracks and she never lied to me to help my wife, but she could have told me and she chose not to. I don't think my brother knew.\n\nMy wife says its her own fault for cheating and my SIL was just being a good friend to her. My SIL says she has done nothing wrong. My brother backs up my SIL.\n\nBut I feel angry towards my SIL. It means 2 people who I'm close to have been deceitful to me. She helped to prolong my hurt.\n\nSo AITA for being mad at my SIL? Should I expect an apology from her?\n\n*Edit: 3 year old daughter. Married 8 years.*\n\n*My wife said she got bored and fell out of love with me. But she said she realised her mistake after she cheated and now she wants to be back together. She said someone else would be lucky to have me.*\n\n*Edit 2: I'm angry with my wife. So I'm not redirecting anger from my wife to my SIL. I'm asking whether I am justified in being angry at my SIL as well as being angry at my wife.*", "created_utc": 1695414446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pkhhv/aita_for_expecting_an_apology_from_my_sil_after/", "score": 1380, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would expect more from my brother.  \n\nNTA \nBut sounds like you\u2019re surrounded by quite a few.\n\nThis sounds like a lengthy affair. What ended it? What prevents your wife from being \u201cbored\u201d again? Is she expecting you to do all the changing? I\u2019d be long gone personally.  You and your daughter deserve better.", "NTA, but everyone else is. Worst betrayal is your wife, but your SIL not only did not tell you, but condoned it according to texts you read. So she doesn't;t feel guilty because you're trying to get your marriage together. Would she have felt guilty if your wife had given you an STD?  \n\nAnd it's one thing for your brother to support his wife, but she LIED. If I were him, I would be a little upset and leery if my spouse were that dismissive of an affair. Not just dismissive but empathized. \n\nI suspect your wife got dumped. You deserve better.", "NTA. She failed in her familial duty of care, and has quite rightly lost your trust. *What else isn't she telling you?*  \n\n\nINFO: Why would SIL sympathise with your cheating wife? How are you as a husband?", "NTA. But I hope she's your soon to be Ex-wife. \n\n>My wife said she got bored and fell out of love with me. But she said she realised her mistake after she cheated and now she wants to be back together. She said someone else would be lucky to have me.\n\nThat's such a bs statement of her to make. \n\nIt's a choice to fall in love with your partner. It's a further choice to keep watering the grass of your relationship. She saw the grass on the other side of the street and wanted to try having that grass, not remembering that it only stays nice if you water it. \n\nThere are steps you can take when things feel monotonous like sprucing things up with dates and gifts, outfits, hell a conversation with you etc... instead of doing any of that she looked elsewhere.\n\n Why is it only after she went through all the steps, getting the number, messaging for a time, setting up the meeting, doing the deed, etc... suddenly she realized her mistake? I'm not buying it. \n\nSounds more like she had a bad time and remembered how good her life was before her actions. Then couldn't deal with the guilt when you were so loving to her. \n\nDoes she show genuine remorse in her actions or just regret she got caught? \n\nGood luck with therapy.", "NTA, so many people seem to have missed the part where SIL supported the affair and said she would understand if your wife left you. She did not stay out of it, she was in it and on the side of the affair. If your wife really wants to reconcile with you she has to understand that she can\u2019t have the same relationship with the friend that supported the affair, especially if the friend is non-apologetic.", "I\u2019m not justifying your SIL\u2019s behavior, but she was in a no-win situation. If she told you, your wife would be mad at her for betraying her confidence and, for all we know, you would *still* be upset with her for withholding info for any amount of time. Your brother might have been upset for his wife \u201cgetting in the middle\u201d of you and your wife\u2019s business. Or, your brother might have known too and is keeping quiet. We just don\u2019t know. You are entitled to feel deceived by your SIL, but lay the responsibility where it belongs\u2026and that\u2019s at your wife\u2019s feet.", "I think your SIL was in an impossible position. I've seen too many instances where someone told and then it was a shoot the messenger situation. Im not sure if I would have said anything either. No one wants to be the one who blows up someones marriage.", "You feel there's an expectation of mutual trust with your SIL.\n\nShe doesn't feel that way.Your wife doesn't feel that way.Your brother doesn't feel that way.\n\nYou're not as close with your SIL as you thought you were. You're at the level of acquaintances. NAH, but sure hurts.\n\nPS \"My wife said she got bored and fell out of love with me.\" - My advice: use condoms, or you'll eventually get an STD.", "INFO: what were the reasons for leaving listed by your wife?\n\nThat seems intentionally vague.\n\nNTA - your feelings are valid, but you now see that how emotionally close to someone matters as much as familial bond to some.\n\nIf I was your brother, I would be in agreement with you and frankly, also be questioning why my partner was fine with knowing someone was being cheated on. However, the obviously don\u2019t feel the same.", "NTA. Your SIL has questionable morals and if I was your brother id be concerned that my wife was ok with cheating.\n\nBut why are you directing by all of your anger at your SIL and brother (though deserved) and not your wife? Your wife cheated. Your wife disrespected you, your marriage, and your family. You should drop all of them. Your wife fell out of love? Fine. Then be an adult and have a conversation and get a divorce.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you believe your wife? She stated she fell out of love. She cheated. Words and actions match. Believe people when they show you Joe they feel. Your wife is upset that she was found out. Had you not discovered the affair she\u2019d still be fucking another man.\n\nYou deserve more than a cheating wife and complicit SIL/brother.", "NTA. A lie of omission is still a lie.  How could she even look at you straight in the eye knowing this?", "NTA. Now you know your SIL can't be trusted. Your wife can't be trusted, and your brother is spineless.", "Sure be mad at your SIL but expecting her to choose you over her is unrealistic even for moral indiscretions.\n\nWhen it happened to me it was two very close mutual friends but they were her friends first. Of course I was pissed neither said anything. But after the dust settled logic kicked in and while I didn\u2019t like it, putting myself in their shoes I definitely understood it. \n\nAs in your situation, they both expressed their understanding of her situation (text messages) but one discouraged the affair saying to either fix things or tell me and leave while the other actively enabled it. I forgave the first one and stopped speaking to the other. \n\nLong story short, your wife\u2019s indiscretion should be the focus not your SIL, she doesn\u2019t owe you a thing. Letting you know would have been nice but it\u2019s not her responsibility, it was your wife\u2019s to not put her in a situation of having to chose.", "If your brother was cheating on his wife would you tell her?", "Take your daughter and leave. Cut ties with useless bro and sis in law.", "I would also feel betrayed and angry, but don\u2019t expect an apology. She doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. But now you know - she\u2019s not your friend. Cordiality is best moving forward. Good luck with restoring your marriage if that\u2019s what you want!  NTA", "NTA.\n\nnot so much because she never told you, but because she never told your wife off. as her friend, your SIL could've told her something. like \"hey, cheating is bad, mmkay?\"\n\ni get it can be hard to be the one saying someone is cheating. what if you didn't believe her? that would end bad for her. \n\nyou finding out was probably better for your sake. \n\nalso, being a good friend is calling them out when they've done something wrong. SIL letting your wife continue her charade is being a bad friend.", "Dude get a divorce", "NTA for what you expect from your SIL. She may think she did not do anything wrong but she also didn't do things right by protecting the secret of the cheater. YWBTA if you choose to take the cheater back. You will be in for a lot of heartaches if you allow yourself to be a doormat.", "Minimalise contact with all three. Look for better friends.", "You can\u2019t fault a person for staying out of a situation that doesn\u2019t concern them. Everyone ends up hating the snitch. And some hate a person for not snitching. Bottom line we are responsible for our own actions and that concerned you and your wife. Feels like lying ya. But it\u2019s staying out of private domestic issues. If she told, your wife would blame her for your leaving or anger. Friends might stop trusting her. Divides would happen around her. Telling is a decision and an action. With consequences that she knows beforehand. She would be guilty of that. Not telling is nothing. The only people who should exchange words or feelings are you and your wife. She cheated. Kept it from you. Deal with her. Not even the guy she cheated withs fault. Only her and you. Don\u2019t project or deflect. Best of luck man. But people\nMake mistakes. Decide if you love her.  That\u2019s the answer.", "NTA - but dude, she's firmly on your wife's team. And your brother firmly backs his wife. You're not going to get an apology. Know who to trust and who to keep at cautious distance while you attempt to recover from your wife's betrayal. Good luck", "Ditch the wife", "She fell out of love with you but wants to get back together with you?", "NTA. That being said, I wouldn't \"expect\" or demand an apology. It's fine to be upset with her and even build distance between you and her because you find her choice(s) disappointing; but that will likely also build distance between you and your brother. You can build a boundary with her, but you should more importantly be building them with your wife. Trust, once broken, is difficult to rebuild.", "NTA, you have every right to feel upset and expect an apology, but it is illusory to expect him to give you one, however, make things clear with your brother and let's hope that it doesn't ruin your relationship with him, and if it does, tell him that now He knows what to expect from his wife.", "NTA. You are aware she realized it after the other guy left her right? Chances are she doesn't want to be alone.", "Focus on your wife homie.  She\u2019ll do it again.", "I don't think you're an AH, but I do think you have an unrealistic expectation. She's not your friend. She's your wife's.", "NTA you are entitled to feel however you want about anything that happens to you. The fact of the matter is you thought this woman was your friend but instead she encouraged your wife to leave you and kept her secrets. Expecting an apology is really pushing it. It\u2019s obvious that SIL saw nothing wrong with her actions and I don\u2019t think an apology is forthcoming. It also shows her morals and ideas about fidelity. If it was me I would treat her in a similar manner she has treated you.", "NTA for how you feel, being cheated on sucks enough but it's even more painful and humiliating to discover that other people in your life knew about it before you did.\n\nBut... you're deflecting. Your wife is the one who betrayed you, but it's easier to be mad at your SIL, because you don't love her and she isn't as important to you as your wife is. I don't blame you for it, it's a rotten situation for you all around.", "It\u2019s obvious SIL values your wife more than you. That\u2019s fine but operate knowing that moving forward. Your brother is your brother. He didn\u2019t know. He\u2019s cleared. You\u2019ll probably need to be base level cordial to your SIL at family functions but don\u2019t let her in the circle of trust anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s your choice to work things out with you wife whether it be for you or your daughters benefit. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou're right to be mad, but you won't get an apology. You should point out to your brother that his wife approves of cheating so she is a potential cheater herself.\n\nYour SIL should have told your brother and asked him to tell you.\n\nHow did your SIL find out, and why doesn't she like you?", "You're not an asshole but neither is SIL. You're wife is the AH and don't try to redirect the blame to the SIL.\n\nYou should leave SIL out of it. \n\nThis is between you and your wife.\n\nAnd in my opinion, although you are angry at SIL for telling wife she would understand if she left you, that is not a wrong thing to tell someone who has fallen out of love with her husband and is cheating.\n\nIf I found out my friend was cheating, I would encourage them to either talk to their husband to try to save the marriage or encourage them to leave because cheating is just going to make things worse.\n\nI hope she encouraged your wife to talk to you but if SIL felt it was a lost cause based off of their convos (and the fact that wife was cheating) then she wasn't wrong to tell your wife to leave you. \n\nNow that you are fighting for the relationship, you should let it go with your SIL. She is a loyal friend to your wife. \n\nCheater or not, you don't get to say who she is going to be friends with and controlling her is a great way to add more hurtles to what you two are going through.", "NTA for wanting an apology, if she didn\u2019t actively tell your wife she was wrong she was supporting it and condoning cheating.\n\nHowever Y.T.A. to yourself for staying with cheating wife - have some self respect. If your daughter grown up came to you and told you her husband had done what your wife had what would you tell her to do?\n\nIt\u2019s over, cheaters don\u2019t cheat once.", "NTA whether or not your SIL should have told you is questionable but from the messages you shared she seemed to be encouraging your wife\u2019s behaviour so I would make it a condition at least until you and your wife are in a better position for that friendship to go low contact. It doesn\u2019t sound like she thinks you and your wife should be together and so may be sabotaging your relationship when you are not around.\n\nAlso don\u2019t expect an apology from your SIL you are not going to get one", "NTA. But you'll never get an apology because she doesn't believe she did anything wrong.", "NTA. Your brother should be a lot more worried about his wife's cavalier attitude toward infidelity.", "NTA, let your brother know she was okay with you getting cheated on. If she can sympathize with a cheater she may also one day be a cheater", "So here\u2019s what the evidence clearly presents:  \n\n1. Your wife feels remorse about getting caught cheating, not about the actual act of cheating itself. People who feel remorse about the act and want to save their marriage come clean, they don\u2019t wait to be caught before trying to salvage the relationship. Also, it sounds like this was an on-going, not one-time thing. That is not the behaviour of someone feeling remorseful.  \n\n2.  You are not close as close with your brother and his wife as you believed you were. Your SIL in particular has very little respect for you as a person.  \n\n3. Your SIL is absolutely fine with cheating on your brother. She may not be currently cheating on him, but she would absolutely cheat given the right circumstances. She was likely planning to use your should-be ex as a similar co-conspirator, the same way your wife confided in her.  \n\n4. Your brother is either aware of this fact and fine with it OR is legitimately too stupid to realize it for himself. And he has proven through his actions that he is also fine with cheating, at least to some level. He may not like getting cheated on, but he was fine with his wife hiding it from you. This also implies that he also knew, or he would likely be upset that she also hid it from him. Or, again, he\u2019s legitimately too stupid to see that if she hid this from him, there are absolutely other things she is also hiding.  \n\nNTA, and the most self-respecting thing you could do would be to cut ties with all three of these toxic people.", "Dude divorce your wife her excuse \"I got bored\" Is the worst one I've ever heard she doesn't respect you at all.", "Well, I think expecting people to tell you that your SO is running around is not practical, especially in a situation like this where your SIL is your wife's bosom buddy. But in that same respect, she can't rightly expect you not to be angry at her \u2014 if she didn't exactly aid the cheating, she definitely abetted it, and there's no reason she should expect you to let her off the hook.", "Definitely NTA, SIL should not have encouraged cheating, that is never good, and there are better solutions for an unhappy marriage than thay. Also, go NC with wife, and NC/LC woth SIL, probably brother too, although it is reasonable for him to support his wife to avoid conflict, so that is on your own judgement", "NAH telling other people's truths has ended relationships and frankly I wouldn't have told you in her shoes either because \"don't shoot the messenger\" is a phrase for a reason", "NTA. I would have issues trusting her after this and the relationship would be forever changed.", "NTA op. It\u2019s perfectly valid to be mad at multiple people surrounding the same event especially with the stances SIL took. I\u2019m sorry for what you and your daughter are going through.", "NTA but also leave the SIL alone. You have every right to be upset but also Sister in law shouldn't be dragged into your wifes stuff it's not like she was your best friend hiding that info or something.", "NTA Your wife doesn\u2019t love you, but realised fending for herself may be difficult so she is willing to endure being married to you. Doesn\u2019t really have that Hallmark romance ring to it. I think it\u2019s disturbing that both your brother and SIL support your wife\u2019s cheating.", "Is there an update on this? Because OP has a lot bigger problems than just a cheating wife! \n\nOP needs to have a direct face to face and immediate conversation with his brother. Because he had to know, that's why he's backing his wife. If he didn't know about the affair, he'd be mad at his wife for not telling him. Because if she supported wife's cheating, possibly sil would feel the need for a free pass too. Brother is not worried about the possibility of his wife cheating. \n\nSister-in-law facilitated in wife's affair, and she did help cover wife's tracks, by not telling OP. Sil encouraged, empathized, and supported the wife leaving OP, instead of suggesting alternatives. So his brother is of that same mindset, by supporting OPs wife. \n\nWhat has OP done to earn the disrespect of his own brother? And his brother is still not supporting him, after the fact. There's more story here, or OPs family sucks! OP needs therapy on, why his direct family feels he doesn't deserve their respect or support.", "NTA. Your anger is justified & I honestly cannot believe your brother would back his wife. I\u2019d tell him that I\u2019ll remember that when I find out his wife is cheating.", "It\u2019s understandable to be upset with SIL. Sure the honorable thing to do would have been to tell you but the reality is that your bond with her is not as strong as your wife\u2019s. So yeah, be mad at your SIL but expecting her to choose you over her is unrealistic. \n\nWhen it happened to me it was two very close mutual friends but they were her friends first.

Personally, I don't believe you would. You already seem to be more resentful towards her than your wife...the actual cheater.", "NAH. I understand why you feel hurt \nand betrayed, but your SIL didn\u2019t cheat on you, and she didn\u2019t lie to you. It was not her responsibility to affirmatively protect or uphold your marriage. That was your wife\u2019s job. It makes sense that SIL felt more loyalty to your wife than she did to you. You can be upset and disappointed about it, and you can distance yourself from her if you want to. But she doesn\u2019t have to apologize to you for keeping her best friend\u2019s secrets.", "NTA\n\nIn situations like this there are people on your team and people not on your team. Your brother and SIL are not on your team. If it makes you feel any better your brother will probably get what's coming to him with his own wife.", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. I don't care what her reasons for cheating were. Cheating is never okay, and doing nothing is still enabling the cheater. Your SIL's morals are questionable at best. You don't support your friends or family by enabling toxic and questionable behavior. She should have told you. If someone knew my partner was cheating and intentionally neglected to inform me, I'd be pissed at them too.", "This sounds like misplaced anger.\n\nSince you and your wife are trying to make things work, you likely don\u2019t feel like you get to be angry with her. So you\u2019ve got this convenient person at hand to be angry with.\n\nDoesn\u2019t mean that your SIL isn\u2019t innocent. While she was put in a difficult position, she ultimately made poor choices. She condoned cheating. I would never trust her again.\n\nThen again, I would also never get back together with someone who carried on a months-long affair. That\u2019s a deep betrayal.\n\nSounds like you need to really reckon with the anger you feel toward your wife and quit looking for a scapegoat.", "Seems like you have way more resentment for your SIL than your wife. Your wife doesn\u2019t respect you and it\u2019s likely she cheats again.\n\nCut your losses and divorce her.", "\"Hey SIL/Bro, just to be clear, if your spouse ever cheats on you, you'd rather i encourage them to divorce you and help hide the affair? Good to know.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour SIL sucks... and your wife/ex is a horrible selfish person", "NTA. Make sure your brother is aware that his wife empathized with your wife having fallen out of love and being willing to cheat. Not sympathized, but empathized.  Important difference there if he stops to consider it.", "Your brother should be worried and watch his back.\n\nNTA", "I bet your brother knew as well and that why he is defending his wife. NTA.", "You\u2019re being a punching bag. Why would you bother with therapy? Just leave her. She will cheat again. She said she fell out of love with you, she\u2019s not in love with you anymore. You don\u2019t just fall out of love, cheat on your husband and then say you wanna stay together. \n\nNTA. Your SIL is terrible and your brother is just as bad for defending her.", "NTA. This should frankly raise a red flag for your brother in regards to his wife's actions during thus affair. Plus, he should be upset that his brother was allowed to be kept in the dark longer because of her.  She did fail you as someone you thought could be trusted as a beloved family member. So, I guess you know there are at least two untrustworthy people in your life. Tread carefully. These two have shown you who they are and how you fit in their esteem.\n\n**edited for misspelled word", "Nta. Your brother is next or is being cheated on", "NTA. People need to be told when their spouse or partner is cheating on them, at the very least for their health", "WTF dude!! She is only \u201cfighting\u201d to keep you guys together because she was dumped. She is no longer in love with you, she will cheat again and be smart about it. Your brother and your SIL are ash holes y you would be an ash hole if you stay with your cheating wife \nNTA", "I'm more concerned about why your SIL's apology is what's currently gnawing at you..\n\nBut honestly, that truth was not hers to tell. It sucks. Big time. But NAH.", "It's entirely reasonable to be angry at her, but consider yourself warned now. You can't trust your sister-in-law because she is closer to your wife.

If it was me I\u2019d be torn too since she\u2019s her friend but also yours. It\u2019s a tough spot but your feelings are valid.", "Nta. Lying by omission is still a thing. I wouldn\u2019t trust either of them", "Forget the both of them. Tell your brother that when your SIL cheats on him, don\u2019t expect you to let him know.", "NTA. It's lying by omission. She helped cover the cheating by not saying a thing. She's close enough in the social circle. The wife only got remorseful because she got caught. SIL is okay with cheating and her being \"a good friend\" is just enabling.  I'd look out for your brother alao.", "NTA. Withholding information on infidelity is definitely a betrayal of trust. I would consider talking to your brother about how he\u2019d feel if the shoe was on the other foot to gauge how you want to move forward with that relationship. \n\nAlso, seems like your wife didn\u2019t stop cheating out of remorse, but because she was dumped and she just doesn\u2019t want to be alone\u2026 I hope counseling goes well for you both, but unless you know exactly why she fell out of love with you or think you failed as a husband to cause her to fall out of love with you, I would be much more keen on divorce if I were you. I don\u2019t think that staying together for the sake of your daughter or just because of history bodes well for your overall life satisfaction. You\u2019re only 30, you are the captain of your destiny, people co-parent all the time, and you can definitely find someone who won\u2019t cheat on you out there. Good luck and my condolences on this hard time.\n\nEdit: typo", "You shouldn\u2019t take the cheater back. Ever. Trust issues forever if you do. As for SIL I\u2019d be very cold with her from now on. No need to be openly angry just don\u2019t give her any of your time or energy.

What if a child was born of the affair? If those questions change your answer, then you are deluded in your initial response. A betrayal of trust by holding information is still a betrayal. Honestly, as I am, my whole response would not have been forgiveness at all. Divorce would have been absolute. No contact for the brother completely. He is blinded by love.

If they want to have a relationship with someone else then to break up with the person they are with (and then they are free to do what they like).  Tell them you'll give them a chance to tell their partner before you do because it's not fair on the person being cheated on.\n\nBut the relationship you had with your SIL is over.  You can't trust her either.  So I would just be pleasant when you have to see her.  Don't tell her anything of any real value and basically gray rock her.  You aren't obligated to have a relationship with her just because she's married to your brother... but it will make it awkward.  You just smile at her but that smile never reaches your eyes.  The question your brother needs to ask is whether his wife would do the same to him if someone else came along and have that same affair.  Perhaps something to pose to him but not if you are both angry at each other... that's a question for another time.... when the dust settles.\n\nBut the apology would not be sincere... it's just paying lip service to you so I wouldn't bother with the expectation of one.  The apology you want is one from the heart where they really do mean what they say... but you aren't going to get that.\n\nAs for your wife... you can't trust she won't do the same again.  Some couples can make it work after an affair but it's damn hard work and it's never quite the same.    Don't stay if the only reason is your child.

So he\u2019s leaving out all the reasons the SIL is siding with his wife.", "I disagree with you but when you mentioned STDs I really did feel even worse for OPs.\n\nHe didn't consent to a threesome and that makes the wife even shittier. \n\nBut still\nWife and OPs wife are more than just friends, they are sisters. That's a bad position for her to be in. Wife chose to confide in her and SIL chose to be understanding. I don't think she would've been wrong persay to tell OP but she isn't wrong for supporting her sister either.", "It is very simple. Literally all of the blame lies with the cheater. Whoever cheats exposes themselves to all kind of broken relationships. I have been cheated on and I have broken off friendships after learning a friend cheated. They were unhappy but why do I care? They are a cheater why so I want to be affiliated with them anyway? I\u2019d rather have it that way than the guilt eating me up actively watching someone I care about get cheated on.   \n  \nTo me, cheating has become way too normalized and often with few consequences, just break up with someone if you do not want to be with them.", "Why is she fighting to get him back?  Maybe he's just a boring guy, they have a young kid and she married him because he seemed stable and like a good provider and she misses her younger days with more excitement?  \n\nI mean, you can go on and on with this game.  I have a good friend that literally could be op, almost beat for beat, just the ages don't match up.  \n\nYou could try asking for info.", "Where is the benifit in that though? If he is lying then he knows he is lying so anything we say is pointless and he knows it's pointless. If he is self-centered and the person that just wants to be right and always thinks he is right then he would not have even come to reddit in the first place.", "Did you know America's famous serial killer Aileen Wuornos have supporters and they're siding with her.\n\nDid you know Terrorist also have supporters and they will side with them.\n\nDid you know Hitler also have supporters and they sided with him.\nDid you know Megan Huntsman who killed her own 6 children have supporters. \n\nDid you know Lori Vallow who killed her own children for some stupid religious beliefs have supporters and people siding with her.\n\nBTW in previous comment you mentioned why should we believe his story here the example :    \n\nDid you know Brandi Worley who killed her own children when husband filed for divorce because of her cheating on that time cops, her family, friends supported her but she killed her own kids just after 24 hrs and her husband posted his story here in reddit how he caught her wife with neighbor and how she is Narc and he fell threatened for his and kids life and no one is supporting him it even telecast in National news on that his reddit post everything.\nSo that's why I'm telling its our choice if we want to believe stories here or not.", "I guess SIL is a technically sister."]}
