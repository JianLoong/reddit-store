It was pretty hard for us at first, for many reason. \nShe also told me she was in love with the both us but didn't wanted to live in a relationship with the 2 of us.\nAt last she understood she was polyamorous, and if I wanted we could be in a \"free relationship\".\nShe could see him whenever she wanted and i could see people, to have sex or not, if I wanted. Except if one us didn't like the person, we won't do anything.\nI accepted because i didn't wanted to lose her and because i love her so much.\n\nDuring this year of free relationship, i didn't have any adventure, but the three of us we've been pretty close and we went on holyday and did some activities as \"friends\".\nBut it's been several months since i made two transgenders friends. I was happy to have some friends that were \"like me\".\nAt some point we began to flirt, my two friends and me, and we decided that we could have s*x, or at least try.\nI spoke about it with my girlfriend, even if we were in a free relationship I wanted to ask her she was okay with that.\nShe was thinking it was too fast to decide to have s*x with them so early, and she doesn't like at all one of the two person, but she told me to let her some time to think about it.\nI told my friends about this and at first we were sad and decided to stop talking but then restarted to talk.\n\nLast week i told her i wanted to see my friends for the night and some time with them, she told me she was scared that something could happen but in case if anything happen i should take some condoms.\nSo Yesterday I went to my friends place and had fun with them.\nUntil we did have s*x.\nThis morning my girlfriend ask me how the night was, let's not talk about the fact that someone broke a window of my car, so i told her the night was good and that we did things. She then told me \"How could u do that after 5 years\".\nI just had a call with her and she reminded about the rule \" if I don't like the person, u don't do anything\" and when I think this, yes she doesn't really like one of the two person but some days earlier she told me that she could like her maybe one day.\n\nSo I was wondering, and I think the answer is yes after that call, AITA for having s*x with them while i'm in a relationship and that my girlfriend doesn't like one of the person.\n\n(Just for more information but it shouldn't change anything, my girlfriend had been diagnosed with DID, she changes of opinion and personalities but can't control it, so sometimes I don't if what she says is  \"true\")\n\nN.B: sorry about my english, I tried my best to make it redeadable)", "created_utc": 1667572323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym0ljf/aita_for_going_on_a_sxual_adventure_with_friends/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
