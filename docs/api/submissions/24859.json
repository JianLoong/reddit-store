Sure that take some work, but it sounds like you are happy to help your sister out in many areas already- which is very kind of you- so this could be a place where you help.", "NTA. I am high functioning autistic, with an older sister who is also on the spectrum but less independent. Because of this, she's been taught to reach out to me first when it comes to learning finances. Most of it is theoretical in nature (she has a checking account linked with our mothers that she's had since she was a child and no personal accounts, I've done her taxes for the last four years since our father died, and she lives for nominal rent without a lease with our mother) but she'll still reach out when she has questions. At the beginning, this was difficult. I was still learning a lot of this myself, since we didn't have financial prep in school or anything, so I wasn't equipped to answer many questions, and she was ignorant of where the lines of comfort were to be drawn. With time (like 7 years of it), we've drawn those lines so I don't get asked for hard information like paystubs or particulars about my 401k, but I also send her the budget that my husband and I made so she can see our general breakdown of expenses. I let her see copies of invoices from contractors, so she can better understand the pros and cons of owning property. She's seen copies of my last three leasing agreements, so she knows better how to know if she's being taken advantage of in the future. It's a balancing act. You haven't found it yet, but it sounds like you might never because of your stance that finances should be private. That's fine and good, but I doubt you can maintain that line AND a good relationship with this sistee. I recommend you encourage your sister to get a financial advisor (some of them get bored outside of tax season, so I've heard) so the onus of her financial education is no longer on you!", "NTA for not showing her your pay stubs etc. But you could Google some and explain using those.", "NTA\n\n>my other sister has been having ago at me for not letting our sister see my finances such as how much tax I pay, my pay checks,\n\n She can show them *HER*  finances", "NTA but just go online and find samples.

Letting people know your finances leads to them having opinions about what you should be doing and whether they can pester you for money.  \nAlso, she has Autism, and so this can be a great lesson in learning that it is rude to ask other people about their finances.  Generalize it beyond just not asking you, as the rest of your family has clearly failed to do for her.", "I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re an asshole.

Your sister wants to learn via a real world example, and you don't want to be that example. All good.\n\nHowever, it does seem like your views on financial secrecy is a bit extreme. It would be pretty difficult to make a household budget with someone when you won't tell them your income, and that would be a red flag for a lot of folks when it comes time for marriage.

Your other sister can show her her payslip and bank statements if she likes. \n\nI will say that this attitude about never telling *anyone* what you make, not even your SO, is taking things too far and will be toxic to your relationships.

You're right - there are plenty of examples that can be used in place of your own personal banking and financial information.  It's none of her business and she's old enough to understand.

I'm guessing the older sister wants you to share the info because she is just flat out nosey.", "NTA  I'm wondering if another member of your family who is curious about your money is prompting your sister to ask you for this info.

It's so easy to not look at prices and just buy on impulse.", "Yes, I agree.

It may be a good lesson to print out those examples (pay stubs and bank statements) so the sister has something tangible to look at. Then also explain why it is important to keep this stuff private and even go into things like which things to keep secret (account numbers,PIN numbers, and the like) and identity theft.", "Just use reference ones online or take her to a bank and they can show and explain things to her herself and maybe start a savings for her.

But it's like trying to figure out a UI issue with your computer:  If the instructions point to certain menus or displays that are not *exactly* like your setup, it can be jarring to the point of complete misunderstanding - and this can be particularly exacerbating for some users.  If your sister has certain docs (pay stubs, etc.), try and use those to chart a path of execution.
