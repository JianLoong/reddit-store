Our twins are in the 8th grade. Our son, Bayard and our daughter, Addilyn.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday, my husband and I both got texts from Bayard that he needed to talk to us when we got home. We found this odd and were talking to each other before the kids got home. Once they were home, we spoke to Bayard in his room. He told us that he had heard that Addilyn was being rude to her History teacher, this teacher also has Bayard in a different period. The teacher is also Bayard\u2019s baseball coach. Bayard and his friends look up to her, she knows so much about the sport and will talk to them about all the games going on, and she also gives them advice on things. My husband and I have never seen Bayard that mad, he was red in the face. He said he didn\u2019t know much of the specific details, but he heard from some kids that Addilyn asked the teacher if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nWe emailed the teacher and got a reply on Tuesday, she admitted everything Bayard said was true and gave us some of the details. What she said was absolutely horrifying, she said it started when Addilyn was talking to some friends while she was trying to instruct the class, when she told her to stop, Addilyn refused. The kids were learning about Thomas Jefferson and one of the kids asked if he was autistic, as the kid had read it somewhere. Addilyn and her friends then made some joke about autistic people, who basically called them stupid.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the kids on the baseball team and Bayard\u2019s friend, is autistic, and Addilyn is very aware of that. He is a really bright and sweet kid. The teacher told her that wasn\u2019t very nice and tried to educate them a bit on what autism was, this is when Addilyn said that the teacher was \u201coverreacting\u201d and asked her if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nThe teacher admitted she didn\u2019t call because she has had bad experiences with these types of phone calls in the past and was afraid of how\u2019d we react, we told her she didn\u2019t need to worry. \r  \n\r  \nAfter this, my husband and I talked and agreed that Addilyn would lose her phone for at least a few weeks and she needed to write an apology letter both to her teacher and to the boy she made fun of, even though he wasn\u2019t in that period of her class.\r  \n\r  \nAddilyn wrote an apology letter to both but they seemed insincere and potentially AI generated, and when asked about it, she admitted she used AI to write it. We told her it needs to be genuine but she\u2019s refusing to write a letter.

Her words did harm to others including her brother and she doesn\u2019t have a right to express her thoughts if they are meant to hurt others. I would also have her research and write a paper about what disrespectful behavior is and provide examples of different types. Hold firm you\u2019ve got this.", "NTA. Add on another few weeks. She\u2019s a mean girl or at the very least, well on her way to becoming one. And. She refused to write her own letter? You are the parent. What you say goes. I wouldn\u2019t even tell her she doesn\u2019t get her phone back until she asks for it. Then you say she\u2019s not getting it back and that next time when you tell her to do something, you expect it to be done. You need to become more sure of yourself. She\u2019s not listening because she knows you are second guessing yourself and is playing on that.", "NTA. Her behavior is not acceptable. Honestly she sounds like a bully.", "NTA\nWell done, parents, for addressing this head on.\nI don't know where she got this outlook from, but keep an close eye on who she's associating with. If she's that adamant and unapologetic,  there's likely someone encouraging her.\nAnd tell her, the more she resists, the punishment goes up\nAmd give her an education on the true nature of freedom of speech. Being hateful is not without consequences.\nAnd I never thought I'll see the day when a woman tells another woman if she's on her period.\nAll the best.\nI have to say,  you raised a good son if he got that enraged over a beloved teacher being disrespected", "NTA. She was being a brat, & taking her phone for a while seems fair. Buuut a forced apology will always sound insincere because it is. I really don\u2019t know what you were expecting.", "Damn, sounds like your daughter needs a lesson in respect. Making fun of someone's disability ain't cool and she should know better. Maybe try talking to her instead of just taking away her phone? Just my two cents.", "NTA that\u2019s a fair punishment for her. she is incredibly rude for what she did to her teacher and that boy.", "NTA. It's an entirely appropriate punishment for what she did, and her saying this is going against her right to express her true thoughts is entirely BS - she can express her true thoughts all she wants as long as she is prepares to live with the consequences.\n\nThat said - this is just scratching the surface. Making her write an apology letter won't change the fact that your daughter is becoming a bully and a person with no respect for others. This is going to require some real work, probably requiring a therapist, to root out her prejudices against other people.\n\nIt's a shame the teacher said she had to be afraid of calling out behavior like this because of how parents would react - that says that, more often than not, these kids are getting their prejudices from them.", "NTA.  Your daughter is a teenage girl, and unfortunately sometimes that means she'll act very mature for her age, and other times she'll act like a brat.  This is one of the latter.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said, you can't force her to be sorry, but you can let her know why she's being a brat and provide appropriate consequences.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe likes to push boundaries.

She\u2019s going to turn into a bully if her behavior isn\u2019t corrected immediately. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s only 13.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter is behaving grossly inappropriately. In my household, she would lose all privileges including any extracurricular activities. \n\nNo phone. No video games. No outings with friends. No parties. No sports. No anything. Her life would become school, coming home, going to her room, and reading books. \n\nThis should probably be for a very long time given how she has intensified the situation by doubling down and then insulting both of you. \n\nGround her for the remainder of the school year and enforce it without mercy.

I had to hand deliver it and tell the teacher I was sorry in person. I hated it at the time, but now that I\u2019m an adult, I realize that it was good parenting. Stay the course with your daughter. She\u2019s not supposed to like her punishments.", "NTA, if I had used AI to write an apology letter at 13 my parents would have bitten my head off (possibly literally).", "You're NTA, but you're also handling this wrong. Forced apologies are meaningless, and you should know that. Make her write and send apologies if they'll make the other parties feel better, but don't pretend that has actually fixed anything. All you're doing for your child is teaching her to avoid getting caught, which is a *good* lesson, but not the *right* lesson. \n\nThere's an underlying issue, here, that needs to be addressed. Something has changed if she went from \"generally polite\" to \"disparaging the disabled and openly mocking teachers.\" Teenagers are inconsiderate and disrespectful of authority figures, but that crossed a line. Ten years ago, she would have been suspended, and probably faced other consequences. \n\nSend the other kids out for an evening, order a pizza, and talk to her. Be kind, considerate, and **listen to what you are told**. Don't attack her, or offer to lighten her punishment. She did something wrong, and she almost certainly knows it was wrong. That's not the point. Your goal is to get her to explain why she acted that way, because it was completely irrational. The answer could be as simple as \"I'm stressed out, whacked my elbow on the door, and it all boiled over.\" Or, it could be something more severe. Illness. Trauma. A feeling of abandonment and lack of care from her parents. You don't know, which is the problem. Don't just assume everything is fine.", "NTA. She thinks it's forcing because she doesn't understand or agree that what she did was wrong. \n\nThat's why you need to take the time to help her comprehend and keep her phone privileges minimum, it'll let her get distracted and go into that bully echo chamber of her friends. \n\nIf this was my kid, and they used AI, the punishment is still ongoing AND extended. Like, if you told her two weeks? She doesn't get the phone until a correct and understanding apology, the apology is REQUIRED to prove that she learned the lesson, THEN the two weeks start, cause she'll put it off and whine and then argue that you haven't given the phone back and it's been two weeks.\n\nYour daughter made fun of her brothers friend, someone she knows, and was sexist and rude af to her teacher, who was kind enough not to tell on her. \n\nShe HAS TO write this. This is a huge issue that you need to address right away, or you're a shitty parent. Kids deserve parents who love them enough to do the hard work and raise them right.", "NTA - As a teacher, I thank you for giving your daughter consequences. Honestly, from experience, your daughter has probably been disrespectful towards teachers and adults in school for awhile. Behavior gets worse when parents give excuses for their children and do not have consequences for disrespectful behavior. Hopefully, you keeping on her will curtail any disrespectful impulses in the future. Plus, open communication with teachers and school staff will show your daughter that this is important. \nThis personality trait is not going to serve her well as an adult trying to get a job, keep a job, or get promoted.", "NTA, she should apologise but she is correct in that a forced apology is no apology", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Forcing her to write an apology letter isn't going to teach her anything - in fact it's likely to do the opposite and make her dig her heels in more.   \nTell her she doesn't have to write an apology letter but if she starts to feel guilty it will help alleviate the guilt and it will make other people feel better about what happened.   \nTalking to her about why it's wrong and using examples to build empathy is more likely to help. If she's resistant don't try to force her to accept it. Just let the seeds build. The next time someone hurts her feelings or she is on the other end, offer her empathy and then bring it back to remind her why these sort of things are wrong.   \nYou can't control how she feels but also let her know that you won't accept bullying and there will be consequences, like not having the phone, if she continues to do it.", "NTA \n\nGood job actually parenting your kids", "Careful about accepting advice from people here. Most are here to judge people.", "Honestly looking at it from an effectiveness standpoint, she is right that making her write an insincere letter of apology is not going to be effective. I agree that she is becoming a bully. But kids don't act out for no reason, and some of you may roll your eyes at this, but genuinely they have their own perspective and experience. It is inexcusable to treat others poorly. But it might help get to the root of the problem if you discuss with her what her view of the situation is. Like really probe her reasoning. It's easy for a kid to feel attacked and then act defensively- it's how their brain is wired to see conflict where it might not be, it's self protective. In that case they will see their response as reasonable and you as an unfair party. That doesn't really get the message across. I also agree with someone who suggested meaningful punishment, like having her volunteer. But I think trying to understand her would go a long way. \n\nNTA btw. Y'all are obviously trying to raise a kind person and are concerned for your daughter.", "I wish I woulda said that to my parents at that age. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI know y'all have to worry about CPS these days, so get creative.

When someone becomes a bully, disrespects adults, and has no empathy for hurting peoples feelings, these kids usually end up on drugs and/or doing criminal acts. Do what you have to now to put your foot down and hopefully turn things around before she gets too far down the wrong path. Also, you\u2019re not going to be able to force her to write a sincere apology letter until she realizes the gravity of what she\u2019s done, but I would force her to research and write a paper on autism and I\u2019d make her write it by hand and not type it.", "NTA, she sounds like a teenager. People are being a little dramatic here with the punishments. Clearly there's some shaky morals and it sounds like she is just trying to be cool and likely struggling with identity issues. She needs a conversation, an open one validating her feelings but still understanding her behavior is completely unacceptable. It sounds like there is some reason she is refusing to write the letter. Typically when you come at someone confrontationally they go into defense mode even if sometimes they may know they were wrong, but as a parent, coming full force with punishing can make a kid go into defense mode and not even be able to fully process what they did. There's clearly some sort of justification going on in her head for what she said, the only real change will happen if you can deconstruct that.", "NTA - Add a day to the three weeks without a phone for every day she refuses to write the apology. There\u2019s a lot more to correcting her attitude then that though.", "NTA, but a letter and losing her phone doesn't sound like enough of a punishment if she's still acting this way", "NTA\n\nYou are being good parents.

She doesnt have to be sorry.

Make her work with disabled children and see if she has the balls to say that ignorant shit to their face. I'm gonna say no. Your daughter is a bully and you NEED to nip it in the bud. I've never been a fan of unnatural consequences, but I think you need to make your daughter sit at the table until she has written the apology, every single day until it gets done.
