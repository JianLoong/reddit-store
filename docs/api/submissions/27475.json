Our twins are in the 8th grade. Our son, Bayard and our daughter, Addilyn.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday, my husband and I both got texts from Bayard that he needed to talk to us when we got home. We found this odd and were talking to each other before the kids got home. Once they were home, we spoke to Bayard in his room. He told us that he had heard that Addilyn was being rude to her History teacher, this teacher also has Bayard in a different period. The teacher is also Bayard\u2019s baseball coach. Bayard and his friends look up to her, she knows so much about the sport and will talk to them about all the games going on, and she also gives them advice on things. My husband and I have never seen Bayard that mad, he was red in the face. He said he didn\u2019t know much of the specific details, but he heard from some kids that Addilyn asked the teacher if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nWe emailed the teacher and got a reply on Tuesday, she admitted everything Bayard said was true and gave us some of the details. What she said was absolutely horrifying, she said it started when Addilyn was talking to some friends while she was trying to instruct the class, when she told her to stop, Addilyn refused. The kids were learning about Thomas Jefferson and one of the kids asked if he was autistic, as the kid had read it somewhere. Addilyn and her friends then made some joke about autistic people, who basically called them stupid.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the kids on the baseball team and Bayard\u2019s friend, is autistic, and Addilyn is very aware of that. He is a really bright and sweet kid. The teacher told her that wasn\u2019t very nice and tried to educate them a bit on what autism was, this is when Addilyn said that the teacher was \u201coverreacting\u201d and asked her if she was on her period.\r  \n\r  \nThe teacher admitted she didn\u2019t call because she has had bad experiences with these types of phone calls in the past and was afraid of how\u2019d we react, we told her she didn\u2019t need to worry. \r  \n\r  \nAfter this, my husband and I talked and agreed that Addilyn would lose her phone for at least a few weeks and she needed to write an apology letter both to her teacher and to the boy she made fun of, even though he wasn\u2019t in that period of her class.\r  \n\r  \nAddilyn wrote an apology letter to both but they seemed insincere and potentially AI generated, and when asked about it, she admitted she used AI to write it. We told her it needs to be genuine but she\u2019s refusing to write a letter.

Her words did harm to others including her brother and she doesn\u2019t have a right to express her thoughts if they are meant to hurt others. I would also have her research and write a paper about what disrespectful behavior is and provide examples of different types. Hold firm you\u2019ve got this.", "NTA. Add on another few weeks. She\u2019s a mean girl or at the very least, well on her way to becoming one. And. She refused to write her own letter? You are the parent. What you say goes. I wouldn\u2019t even tell her she doesn\u2019t get her phone back until she asks for it. Then you say she\u2019s not getting it back and that next time when you tell her to do something, you expect it to be done. You need to become more sure of yourself. She\u2019s not listening because she knows you are second guessing yourself and is playing on that.", "NTA. Her behavior is not acceptable. Honestly she sounds like a bully.", "NTA\nWell done, parents, for addressing this head on.\nI don't know where she got this outlook from, but keep an close eye on who she's associating with. If she's that adamant and unapologetic,  there's likely someone encouraging her.\nAnd tell her, the more she resists, the punishment goes up\nAmd give her an education on the true nature of freedom of speech. Being hateful is not without consequences.\nAnd I never thought I'll see the day when a woman tells another woman if she's on her period.\nAll the best.\nI have to say,  you raised a good son if he got that enraged over a beloved teacher being disrespected", "NTA. She was being a brat, & taking her phone for a while seems fair. Buuut a forced apology will always sound insincere because it is. I really don\u2019t know what you were expecting.", "Damn, sounds like your daughter needs a lesson in respect. Making fun of someone's disability ain't cool and she should know better. Maybe try talking to her instead of just taking away her phone? Just my two cents.", "NTA that\u2019s a fair punishment for her. she is incredibly rude for what she did to her teacher and that boy.", "NTA. It's an entirely appropriate punishment for what she did, and her saying this is going against her right to express her true thoughts is entirely BS - she can express her true thoughts all she wants as long as she is prepares to live with the consequences.\n\nThat said - this is just scratching the surface. Making her write an apology letter won't change the fact that your daughter is becoming a bully and a person with no respect for others. This is going to require some real work, probably requiring a therapist, to root out her prejudices against other people.\n\nIt's a shame the teacher said she had to be afraid of calling out behavior like this because of how parents would react - that says that, more often than not, these kids are getting their prejudices from them.", "NTA.  Your daughter is a teenage girl, and unfortunately sometimes that means she'll act very mature for her age, and other times she'll act like a brat.  This is one of the latter.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that said, you can't force her to be sorry, but you can let her know why she's being a brat and provide appropriate consequences.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe likes to push boundaries.

She\u2019s going to turn into a bully if her behavior isn\u2019t corrected immediately. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s only 13.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter is behaving grossly inappropriately. In my household, she would lose all privileges including any extracurricular activities. \n\nNo phone. No video games. No outings with friends. No parties. No sports. No anything. Her life would become school, coming home, going to her room, and reading books. \n\nThis should probably be for a very long time given how she has intensified the situation by doubling down and then insulting both of you. \n\nGround her for the remainder of the school year and enforce it without mercy.

I had to hand deliver it and tell the teacher I was sorry in person. I hated it at the time, but now that I\u2019m an adult, I realize that it was good parenting. Stay the course with your daughter. She\u2019s not supposed to like her punishments.", "NTA, if I had used AI to write an apology letter at 13 my parents would have bitten my head off (possibly literally).", "You're NTA, but you're also handling this wrong. Forced apologies are meaningless, and you should know that. Make her write and send apologies if they'll make the other parties feel better, but don't pretend that has actually fixed anything. All you're doing for your child is teaching her to avoid getting caught, which is a *good* lesson, but not the *right* lesson. \n\nThere's an underlying issue, here, that needs to be addressed. Something has changed if she went from \"generally polite\" to \"disparaging the disabled and openly mocking teachers.\" Teenagers are inconsiderate and disrespectful of authority figures, but that crossed a line. Ten years ago, she would have been suspended, and probably faced other consequences. \n\nSend the other kids out for an evening, order a pizza, and talk to her. Be kind, considerate, and **listen to what you are told**. Don't attack her, or offer to lighten her punishment. She did something wrong, and she almost certainly knows it was wrong. That's not the point. Your goal is to get her to explain why she acted that way, because it was completely irrational. The answer could be as simple as \"I'm stressed out, whacked my elbow on the door, and it all boiled over.\" Or, it could be something more severe. Illness. Trauma. A feeling of abandonment and lack of care from her parents. You don't know, which is the problem. Don't just assume everything is fine.", "NTA. She thinks it's forcing because she doesn't understand or agree that what she did was wrong. \n\nThat's why you need to take the time to help her comprehend and keep her phone privileges minimum, it'll let her get distracted and go into that bully echo chamber of her friends. \n\nIf this was my kid, and they used AI, the punishment is still ongoing AND extended. Like, if you told her two weeks? She doesn't get the phone until a correct and understanding apology, the apology is REQUIRED to prove that she learned the lesson, THEN the two weeks start, cause she'll put it off and whine and then argue that you haven't given the phone back and it's been two weeks.\n\nYour daughter made fun of her brothers friend, someone she knows, and was sexist and rude af to her teacher, who was kind enough not to tell on her. \n\nShe HAS TO write this. This is a huge issue that you need to address right away, or you're a shitty parent. Kids deserve parents who love them enough to do the hard work and raise them right.", "NTA - As a teacher, I thank you for giving your daughter consequences. Honestly, from experience, your daughter has probably been disrespectful towards teachers and adults in school for awhile. Behavior gets worse when parents give excuses for their children and do not have consequences for disrespectful behavior. Hopefully, you keeping on her will curtail any disrespectful impulses in the future. Plus, open communication with teachers and school staff will show your daughter that this is important. \nThis personality trait is not going to serve her well as an adult trying to get a job, keep a job, or get promoted.", "NTA, she should apologise but she is correct in that a forced apology is no apology", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Forcing her to write an apology letter isn't going to teach her anything - in fact it's likely to do the opposite and make her dig her heels in more.   \nTell her she doesn't have to write an apology letter but if she starts to feel guilty it will help alleviate the guilt and it will make other people feel better about what happened.   \nTalking to her about why it's wrong and using examples to build empathy is more likely to help. If she's resistant don't try to force her to accept it. Just let the seeds build. The next time someone hurts her feelings or she is on the other end, offer her empathy and then bring it back to remind her why these sort of things are wrong.   \nYou can't control how she feels but also let her know that you won't accept bullying and there will be consequences, like not having the phone, if she continues to do it.", "NTA \n\nGood job actually parenting your kids", "Careful about accepting advice from people here. Most are here to judge people.", "Honestly looking at it from an effectiveness standpoint, she is right that making her write an insincere letter of apology is not going to be effective. I agree that she is becoming a bully. But kids don't act out for no reason, and some of you may roll your eyes at this, but genuinely they have their own perspective and experience. It is inexcusable to treat others poorly. But it might help get to the root of the problem if you discuss with her what her view of the situation is. Like really probe her reasoning. It's easy for a kid to feel attacked and then act defensively- it's how their brain is wired to see conflict where it might not be, it's self protective. In that case they will see their response as reasonable and you as an unfair party. That doesn't really get the message across. I also agree with someone who suggested meaningful punishment, like having her volunteer. But I think trying to understand her would go a long way. \n\nNTA btw.

When someone becomes a bully, disrespects adults, and has no empathy for hurting peoples feelings, these kids usually end up on drugs and/or doing criminal acts. Do what you have to now to put your foot down and hopefully turn things around before she gets too far down the wrong path. Also, you\u2019re not going to be able to force her to write a sincere apology letter until she realizes the gravity of what she\u2019s done, but I would force her to research and write a paper on autism and I\u2019d make her write it by hand and not type it.", "NTA, she sounds like a teenager. People are being a little dramatic here with the punishments. Clearly there's some shaky morals and it sounds like she is just trying to be cool and likely struggling with identity issues. She needs a conversation, an open one validating her feelings but still understanding her behavior is completely unacceptable. It sounds like there is some reason she is refusing to write the letter. Typically when you come at someone confrontationally they go into defense mode even if sometimes they may know they were wrong, but as a parent, coming full force with punishing can make a kid go into defense mode and not even be able to fully process what they did. There's clearly some sort of justification going on in her head for what she said, the only real change will happen if you can deconstruct that.", "NTA - Add a day to the three weeks without a phone for every day she refuses to write the apology.

He doesn\u2019t know about it and someone handing him a letter saying they were making fun of him but sorry, doesn\u2019t make sense and does more damage.

I don't think she should have to apologize to the autistic  child as she didn't bully him directly. Since she wants attention, let her have it. Have AI generate an unnecessarily long apology letter to the teacher and another one to autistic students in general. She can read both at the next school assembly or pep rally.  Offer to live stream on her social media sites.", "NTA though instead of an insincere apology, there might be another angle to take. I got some heat on this when my kids were younger but I never made them apologize for what they said until they were ready. However, I did make them make amends.

The other advisor told me if had a nickel for every time a teen told him that \u2026\n\nI was getting heat because my kid felt completely justified in his feelings and he was not sorry at all (and 15 years later probably still isn\u2019t!) After a couple of weeks of people coming up to me crying on her behalf, yes really, I made him send an email. It was not an apology for telling her to fuck off. It was something like, \u201cIf I had known how much this was going to upset my mom, I wouldn\u2019t have said what I said\u201d. She accepted it. \n\nA long story to say there might be another way to approach it. My youngest is 25 so my creative parenting juices are failing me at the moment.

Let's face it: I know no girl or woman who didn't hear that \"reasoning\" at one point of their life. Why does your daughter  think it is OK to say such things?

OK, Addilyn, you were offered a very clear way to make up for this and refused, and actually went so far as to cheat on the consequence so it\u2019s off the table. Instead, you will create a power point presentation to give at school during lunch about what autism is and how it impacts people and their lives. The presentation needs to be a minimum of 20 minutes and needs to be your original work, we will be running it through a plagiarism app. Until this is complete to our standards you will not receive your phone back, you will also be grounded and there will be no exceptions. In addition, we will be discussing what occurred with your friends parents and if your friends are not also apologetic for the bullying they will not be welcome in our home. Why? Because we do not bully people; we do not make fun of disabilities, and we do not treat teachers or anyone trying to so their job and get through their day with disrespect. This is a family and house rule and it\u2019s not open for negotiation. \n\n2. We understand you are angry at this, but we care a lot more about raising a decent human who treats others well then we do if you are mad at us.

The idea is to have her do something to repair the harm. It\u2019s also a good time to look into volunteering. Good kids, girls especially, Can do this at her age. My daughter tried to bully an elementary friend at that age and I did everything I suggested to you.

Addilyn knew better than to say the things she said, and you're right to take her phone and make her write a letter of apology.

Tell her her \"right to express her true thoughts\" is not absolute and doesn't give her the right to express hurtful, prejudiced, and ignorant sentiments. If her \"true thoughts\" are that awful, she needs additional consequences: she should interview a special ed teacher about autism, what it is, what it isn't, and how damaging it is for kids with autism to hear comments like hers, and she should research how comments about menstruation are considered by courts to be sexual harassment under Title IX.\n\nI would also look into who her friends are. Peer pressure and in-groups are HUGE at that age in shaping kids' behaviors and attitudes. Ask Addilyn how her friend group views autism and how they talk to teachers. My guess is she's getting these attitudes from friends. Tread carefully. You want her to start questioning her friends' reactions, not resent you for trying to separate her from her friends. \n\nYou mentioned that your son plays a sport. Does Addie?

When she is ready to have a real discussion about her behavior and determine an agreed upon restitution things will remain as they are. No phone, no extra activities beyond school and sport until it is resolved. Then move on. It's on her and she needs to repair.

She can also look up some autism success stories (Bill Gates, for example, or Elon Musk who says he's got Asperger's, which is on the spectrum). Often people lash out and create harm when they don't understand something. I think if she writes the report and does the research, you quite likely would see a change in her attitude towards autistic people and the apologies she owes.\n\nRegardless of what she chooses though, she needs to make amends other than with an apology, and that choice should be up to her, though obviously you should guide that discussion and approve of her choice. It might be that she spends some time cleaning chalkboard erasers, or spending time with the autistic boy she demeaned, or something else entirely, but this is the soul of restorative justice and can make a huge difference, and letting her choose makes it something she's more likely to do and do well, and it'll have the most positive impact.\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA\nDo not give in an inch.\nMaybe also take their computer privileges away, and other privileges too.

You have to stay involved and have strong communication.", "That doesn\u2019t even make sense. One kid is the complete opposite of the other.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Hand written letter, no phone, sitting at the kitchen table supervised until its done. \n\nDoesn't seem sincere enough? Write it again. Failure to do so will result in item being taken away or things being canceled.", "I\u2019m also thinking that writing an essay for you on autism with sources (and no AI) assistance is warranted. More work for you and her, but time well spent. I\u2018d also be looking at the \u201cwhy\u201d situation, including friends who might be bad influences.", "This need to be too comment", "She\u2019s free to express her true thoughts. Others are free to hold her accountable for them. She wants the first without the second.", "They might remind her that \u201crights\u201d still carry consequences.  Also - this kid is totally using AI to cheat in school as well.", "She's a bully at 13, thankfully OP seems to have one decent twin. Addilyn needs to lose more than her phone.", "Interesting", "If she\u2019s bold enough to say it in front of a teacher she\u2019s not in the making.", "Bully \"in the making\"? Too late. It's a bully \"already made\". Her parents now have to un-make that aspect of her.", "Honestly, speaking as a mental health counsellor -- counselling doesn't change people's values. We can try, and we can make space to explore what's going on emotionally to underlie this, but we don't have special tools to get around the defensive response someone has when they're told they're in the wrong. I'm concerned this girl would just learn to use therapy speak to justify her behaviour.  What she needs is education and exposure to diverse experiences, and possibly removal from the spaces where she's learning that this is cool or popular.", "I agree. Send her to therapy. She requires empathy and self awareness. It will help understand why she feels compelled to be such a bully.", "My father & uncles were WWII Army. If I had been rude to a teacher or called any adult names, I would have felt a belt on my bare bottom, been grounded for a long time & lost my allowance for the amount of time I was grounded. An apology would have been made in person with an adult family member in the room. While I'm not suggesting that Addilyn's parents use corporal punishment, she should lose all of her electronics and be grounded for a while. If she has a laptop, school work can be done at the kitchen table with one or both parents ensuring that she's not using AI. She should also have to apologize to her teacher and the boy in person, not with insincere letters.", "This is all to common behavior unfortunately.", "Or read several books and discuss them. Which is harder to fake using AI. \n\nOn people like Temple grandin, whose family was told to basically throw her away.  She went on to become very well respected in the animal welfare field. Helping to create  areas that are leas stressful for them.   \n\nNTA ,  dig your heals in on this OP.", "Agreed. I'd make her hand write the apology letters in the kitchen or some room without a computer as well.", "Handwritten, in the presence of parents, so they can see she is only using her computer for research", "That's actually a brilliant idea!! Treat it as they have to do a research paper for extra work", "Turn off the WiFi and make her hand write it!", "Honestly, don't force her to volunteer. She likely would say these things to those kids' faces. They don't deserve her abuse. Unless you mean just helping the teacher, but what teacher would want to spend time with her extra. They have enough to deal with and shouldn't have to be part of correcting the behavior more than they are. The teachers shouldn't have to be responsible for this lesson unless they want to. Was your friend being this confrontational? I am glad it helped them at least, it's just she's treating the teachers badly already. She'll just keep saying her \"honest opinions\".", "Might be best. An apology to the teacher is absolutely necessary. But the boy she called names wasn't in her class. Can you imagine not knowing what someone said about you, and then getting a letter \" I said this about you and my parents made me apologize but I don't want to\"?. Unless the boy heard, don't hurt him by giving that letter", "It likely means that there are some mean girl friends involved and those friendships need to be severed, stat. These things don\u2019t just typically show up on their own.", "Right? It takes how long to type out a short apology letter, they didn't want to supervise their kid that long? That's what school is for now, I guess. Babysitting and morals, but only when they're the right morals, otherwise we burn the books. /s", "Being grounded just means the child can't go out (e.g. to friend's places, parties, dates, etc.). It says nothing about whether the child has access to their phone, computers, TV, etc.", "In my book, grounding is no phone, no computer, no friends over, not going anywhere but school. She needs the computer for school work? Fine, in a common space with supervision. Then the computer is put away until needed for school work.", "Many times, at this age girls will start acting out in an attempt to get the attention of the cool kids. If this is the reason she is acting this way, shut it down. Integrity is way more important than popularity. I was a hard ass when my kids were that age, no electronics except for homework, and if being popular is more important than being nice then you can do it with one pair of jeans and two t shirts. I only had to pack up my daughter's room for her to understand how serious I was about her changing her attitude. She is one of my best friends now and graduating from uni in deaf studies.", "All it takes is one wrong friend.", "She\u2019s in the 8th grade. Clubs right now don\u2019t matter one bit.", "You would hope so but they are oddly specific. Whatever happened to John and Jane as goto proxy names?", "Sorry, English is my third language lol", "Disagree, I  often see parents with kids of same or similar ages creating scapegoat children and this can be a proximate cause to acts such as this", "It is - but that doesn't mean people are giving good advice or judging fairly. It's an excuse to condemn people.", "Old school, hand written using the library and citing sources.", "Or an essay on being an asshole cause that theme seems important for this kid to reflect\nUpon", "She's hyped up on teenage \"righteous anger\".  This is a real life wake up call.  You cannot do this to people with authority over you.  The period question was out of line and sexist. Obviously the autistic jokes were terrible.  \n\nIn my house the phone wouldn't be back and wed probably be doing lessons together on autism, sexism, and whatever else fits the bill until the behavior changes.", "That's not going to make her stop being a bully.", "FAIR", "Lol. When you said exposure to diverse experiences. I\u2019m reminded of my high school days. I\u2019m African and grew up in Africa. I went to a boarding school in Africa for secondary school (middle and high school) and every semester you\u2019d come back to school and find a new student with a different accent. \n\nBasically. Kids with African parents living abroad. If the kids started acting out or developed disciplinary issues, their parents would move them \u2018back home\u2019 to experience a diverse culture. \n\nThey usually went back home after a year or two. Some would finish high school there. But, yea, they usually went home with different attitudes.", "This is a good idea", "Haha. I\u2019d actually say. Ditch the computer completely. She can use hard copy resources and print out articles she might need. She can kick it old school.", "Agreed. Don't subject us to bullies as a teaching lesson for them. We usually have enough of that going on already. :/.", "This, 100%", "That is amazing!", "Even one wrong friend has to exert pressure for a while. Takes more than a few hours for a personality change like that.", "Fair point", "Hey, good for you. I only know one language.", "In cursive.  At the kitchen table.", "She needs to learn this kind of behaviour has consequences she won't like.", "Yes! The kitchen table was my first thought after reading about the AI. Sometimes the old ways are still the best.", "Taking the phone away for a week is a good start but making her write an insincere apology is likely to make her dig her heels in more. It's not going to help. It might make you feel like you've done something about it - but you haven't.", "I hated the kitchen table!  Mom always walking by to make sure you're not goofing off!", "The apology letter should be written, by hand, in front of the parents.  The point is teaching the child a lesson - actions have consequences.  However, this isn't enough.  The parents should be taking everything away for a month - no phone, no table, no TV, no computer, no outside activities - except maybe some volunteer work.", "So you want her to dig her heels in more? Get more secretive about the abuse? Or you just want to punish her?", "Oh, you pretend to follow Jesus. No wonder you're such a big fun of punishment."]}
