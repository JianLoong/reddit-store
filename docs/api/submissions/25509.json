She accepted a contract to work nine months in a major US city before we were committed, so we are temporarily long-distance. I'm a lawyer but I'm working as a public defender for now so Girlfriend earns about 35% more than I do. Because of this, Girlfriend paid for me to travel to visit her this week without a second thought even though I offered to split the airfare. It might be relevant to mention that girlfriend is unusually kind and generous, but she was married to a guy who took advantage of that and was marginally employed while spending her money until she left him a couple years ago.\n\nMy girlfriend's cousin (50f) lives in this city and is basically her connection to the rest of her family. Girlfriend's parents are from Europe but came to the US in their 20s and raised her to be \"American,\" then retired back to Europe. Cousin moved to the US for university and stayed. Girlfriend lived with Cousin in grad school and I know they are very close but don't always see eye-to-eye, and it was very important to Girlfriend that I met Cousin.\n\nWe met Cousin at a nice restaurant, and Girlfriend had previously offered to buy dinner since I had paid roughly the same the night before for dinner and movie. I thought all was going well with Cousin until the bill came. Girlfriend offered to pay the whole bill, and Cousin refused, saying instead she would split it with her. Girlfriend protested but Cousin took the bill, added her credit card, and handed it to the waiter. \n\nThe next day, I was reading while girlfriend was getting ready to go out when I saw my name come up in a text preview on her phone beside me. It was from Cousin, basically saying that I had made a good impression until I was rude and let them buy me dinner. I tried to ignore it but I looked uncomfortable when Girlfriend came over and she went into her bedroom, shut the door, and called Cousin. The walls in her apartment are thin and I could hear her protesting that I had paid for dinner the night before and it was her turn and she was the hostess anyway, but it was clear cousin wasn't budging on her opinion. I also heard girlfriend mention that she had paid for my flight because she earns more than me and she was sick of hearing about it.\n\n After the call, Girlfriend told me not to worry, but now I am worried that Cousin is going to tell the family that I'm a bum who is using girlfriend. I don't always pick up on social cues well.

The degree to which all 3 of you either magnify or minimize the incident will be very telling of your future. \n\nYou probably should have insisted on splitting the bill.  It\u2019s not fair or logical but it\u2019s still that way sometimes. If it really bothers you, you could invite both of them to dinner and pay for it. \n\nBut Honestly, this shouldn\u2019t be a big deal?  Whoever makes it one, including you, needs to settle down & move on.", "NTA. If you just treated your girlfriend the night before, there's nothing wrong with letting her treat you, and her cousin jumped in of her own volition. That said, be careful of a dynamic where, because your girlfriend makes more, she always pays for more - given her personal history, money in relationships is probably still more of a fraught issue for her, and her family and friends may be especially sensitive or paranoid about partners taking advantage of her.", "NTA, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what happened here \u2014 I\u2019m wondering if maybe when Cousin offered to \u201csplit it\u201d she meant that she wanted to pay for her part, and Cousin was expecting you to then offer to chip in for your part at least. \n\nSince they ended up splitting it just between the two of them, it means Cousin paid for part of your meal which is what I\u2019m guessing she was unhappy about. \n\nI\u2019ll say NTA though since she should have spoken up instead of being salty about it later. Everyone seems to be assuming that Cousin is mad about you not paying for the whole dinner but I don\u2019t know if we can assume that\u2019s the case \u2014 it\u2019s possible Cousin was fine with paying for themself, but they just didn\u2019t want to end up paying for half of your dinner.\n\nTo be honest, if I were meeting someone for the first time I probably would at least offer to pay for myself in a situation like that just to double check that they\u2019re ok with covering a portion of someone else\u2019s meal.", "NTA- cousin chose to pay for the meal, no one was forcing them to do it. Guys do NOT have to pay for meals out all the time.  This was not a first date situation (even then it should be split bill or talked about first).", "NTA... i think you are being judged by not picking up on odd social cues in another country.  I have a tendancy to believe people when they offer me something like a dinner out. I certainly mean it with all my heart when I ask someone out for dinner.  Just keeping things honest, and maybe asking GF to let you know if there is an opportunity to fix things, or to understand things better.", "NTA. It's pretty normal for couples to take turns on who pays. Cousin was way out of line.", "NTA but depending on the country gf\u2019s family comes from, this could reflect badly. Some cultures are more traditional than others, and in some countries people would look strangely at a woman picking up the bill.\nDepending on where exactly her family is from, it might not be seen as weird at all though. \n\nI think it might be the combination of having her pay for your ticket and the meal that gave the impression she might be paying for everything.\n\nCousin is clearly looking out for girlfriend, so that\u2019s not a bad thing, and she might yet come around. Maybe you can have a one on one conversation with her and you know she is concerned and just talk about your views on relationships and money.. just an open conversation and see where that goes. If you\u2019re straightforward and honest, she might still like you, and she said her first impression of you was good, so there\u2019s that.", "NTA. But I think your concerns are valid about the rest of the family. You might consider trying to make amends with the cousin - invite her to do something else with you both, your treat.", "NTA, my wife and I took turns paying while dating. Even though it evens out it still feels nice when the other person pays, and then when you return the generosity. It's a subtle thing but it feels more intimate than splitting the bill, becomes less about who owes for what.", "NTA - once you get home, send your girlfriend and her cousin each a reasonably nice bouquet of flowers with a note saying how much it meant to visit them. Kill her with kindness if you must.\n\nIt will prove to your girlfriend that you care about the things she cares about, even if her cousin never changes her tune.", "NTA in the sense you did nothing wrong, but in general this would have been a good time to swoop in and do the whole \"i'm the dude and i'm paying.\"  I HATE this dynamic but it exists.  It's stupid and irrational but first impressions do matter no mater how illogical.\n\nDon't worry about it too much now but do ask your GF to set up a dinner with y'all in the future where you cover everyone's meal for appearances.  That will hopefully smooth things over.", "NTA - there\u2019s this TIK tok that shows what it\u2019s like to date different men from around the world and when a women offers to pay something. It\u2019s just stereotyping, but funny. \n\nAsians - fight and demand to cover the bill and shoves the female card away \n\nEuropean will say ok we split no worries \n\nAmerican - guy side eyes and see girl pulling out her card and he slowly puts his card back in the wallet. \n\nIn general, I always recommend don\u2019t take for granted if you are trying to make a good impression. In this case I would have made sure the cousin didn\u2019t pay for anything of yours and just would have thrown in my card and say let\u2019s split 3 way. \n\nOverall you and your gf know what you spend on. But to be honest if my gf paid for my plane ticket I would be covering all meals.", "NTA. Cousin is. How you and your GF handle bills is up to the two of you and none of Cousins business. Cousin had three options: pay the whole bill, just pay her part (or one third of the total bill if everyone had roughly the same) or accept GFs offer. And in either case, she should have kept her opinions on you paying/not paying to herself.", "NTA, especially since you and your girlfriend seem to have a mutual understanding. If your girlfriend is fine (and seems like she is) covering for you, that's between you and her, not your cousin.\n\nHowever, food for thought...your girlfriend paid for your flights, and presumably, you're staying for free with her. You paying roughly the same price the night before is not really taking turns. She already covered the bulk of your trip, so that justification doesn't really work imo. If it were me, I'd be paying for all the meals, especially the one where you're trying to make a good impression if perception matters to you. And unless you're broke, once the cousin you had never met went to go pay for half the bill (basically covering half of your meal assuming everyone's pieces were relatively equal) then you probably should've at least gotten your part.", "NTA - don\u2019t offer to pay for a meal if you are going to be pissed off if that\u2019s what you actually end up doing\u2026.", "NTA. If it was girlfriend\u2019s turn to pay and she also wanted to pay for cousin that\u2019s fine. If cousin didn\u2019t want her to pay for her, instead of splitting the bill 50/50 with girlfriend she could have paid a third and girlfriend then pay two-thirds which covers your half of your and her meal. \n\nThis is outdated sexism from cousin; that the man should cover the bills. And perhaps a bit of a hangover from the ex who sounds like a grifter. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that your girlfriend defended you/explained to cousin. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "No.", "I think her cousin just might be concerned about her going through another situation like her last relationship. It would probably help to have another dinner with your girlfriend and her cousin and then pay for it. But as long as you and your girlfriend both feel you did nothing wrong, you don't HAVE to do anything.", "YTA. Cousin didn\u2019t know about you paying the night before and naturally concluded she was responsible for one third. You should have chipped in your card and mooched off your gf next night.", "NTA\n\nHer sister is a major turd. Glad your GF knows this.", "NTA. But I\u2019m a little concerned that were snooping in her phone and eavesdropping on her convo.", "you probably shouldn\u2019t be letting her pay for your stuff while there considering she paid for your airfare. It does look bummy. You should have paid your entire own airfare, why would you even offer half? This is all embarrassing stuff.", "NTA. You paid the night before, so faire is faire. Your girlfriend's family have some ex boyfriend problems?! Its their problem. You cant pay for this men's mistakes. \nAlso your girlfriend doesnt really need to tell her cousin or family all she pay for you (within reason, of course). The dinner, the cousin could figure it out. But the flight?! Why your gf tellimg her those stuffs?! \nYou should talk to her to see if she is really ok with this money manegment, if she is, like her cousin, traumatize with this ex. \nHonestly, can you imagine live your life being afraid that gf family will think you are taking advantage of your wife just because she eventually pays for stuff because she earns more?!", "Hmm I'd say NTA, but only because you are American. Depending where from Europe she is from, it could be a cultural thing you are not aware of. From what I know (I'm northAfrican European), the closer you are to the Mediterranean sea, the more you fight to pay the bill (not to avoid it lol). Even if you are invited, you just say you will pick up the tab, and the other will tell you that you are invited (examples to avoid fighting, swearing to god, be the fastest, going to the bathroom and secretly paying on the way back...).\n\nFrom where I'm from, what you did would be social faux pas, you should have not paid the day before when you were only the 2 of you, and proposed to pay in front of her family to make a good impression. But as I said, it's cultural, a culture your gf is probably not really aware of", "Why are you letting cousin bully you?  It's none of their business who pays for what.  NTAH.", "The social norm is to offer to pay or split the bill. That's what you should do.", "Man, this is tough. I think some families are weird about paying. My family, both sides, are obsessive about paying. I think maybe because you sat there and didn't even offer that made you look bad. Next time you're with her family, you always offer. Never forget this. Her family will probably also offer so there might be a fight over the check. If you really want to pay, you sneak off to the restroom and pay. Good luck.", "So I (f) I\u2019ve been married for 20 years and when we are out, I always pull the credit card out and pay. It must look like I\u2019m the one who pays the bill but in all honesty every single thing is in my husband\u2019s name including that credit card I\u2019m throwing out so I may be throwing the card down but I am not paying the bills!!!

So is that really right either ? I don\u2019t think so.

Everyone is different but I know if I were op and even though I agreed I could pay for dinner however you offered to pay for my cousin and I because you wanted to make a good impression i would\u2019ve been so happy and proud of you and just so happy my cousin would be able to see you in the same light as I did. Especially since I already paid for your flight and if you\u2019re capable of paying for dinner it would\u2019ve been nice to know you were considerate of these things and do. You didn\u2019t have to pay your half of the flight and saved that $ which could\u2019ve easily paid for this dinner. I like to date men who have provider mindset and are generous with me so things like this would\u2019ve been a turn off to me (I am upfront to men who are pursuing me that these are qualities I want in a partner) however everyone is different. OP your girlfriend sounds like an amazing girl and how she defended you and gave you the reassurance was very nice to see. Not everyone would do this and some would\u2019ve texted back something hurtful to you if you seen it but it\u2019s nice to see how she was with you and to her cousin and just having your back. I would say if you can just to be just as amazing as her is offer to take her and her cousin to lunch. I know what the cousin said might\u2019ve hurt your feelings but it\u2019s also just her thoughts and I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t say it maliciously. We girls talk to each other and it\u2019s just blunt girl talk without the intent of it going anywhere then the intended receiver. She\u2019s important to your gf so it\u2019ll be nice to show her in an mature bigger person way that it\u2019s okay and show her the qualities that make your gf love you and have that good relationship for your gf. Prove her doubts wrong with kindness. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also see in a good positive light if you did this like instead of being mad or butt hurt your kind and treat the girls to lunch.

By accepting you are taking advantage of her generosity.", "NTA. \n\nHonestly it really doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks. You and your girlfriend know you aren\u2019t being cheap (which is what I would assume cousin thought the problem was), and that you take care of each other.

The cousin will also see him in a new light that even after that he shows this kindness and offering to take her out instead of responding in a negative way. I feel like doing this would make an amazing impact on all of the relationships. If OP\u2019s girl is important and been super generous with him, he should want to be the same and give her this back. When you love someone you\u2019ll want to go out of your way to make them happy and sometimes you\u2019ll want to put your ego or pride away to do so because the outcome is worth it. Also you were able to save half your flight because gf was generous and paid for it, i would think financially you\u2019ll be able to take care of dinner for the girls so why not invite them out a second time and do it just cause.

It\u2019s like how men will hold the door for me all day long, but when I hold the door for a man, it\u2019s like I tried to rip his balls off with my teeth.

She\u2019s not making 3x what you make. It\u2019s not clear why she should be paying for your flights and half of the meals. Who would even think to split the flight?
