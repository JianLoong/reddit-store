I bet they would be offended if your kids names followed a trend that the in-laws made up.  It\u2019s not a tradition if it\u2019s only one generation meaning DH\u2019s parents naming program.

We love our new traditions we made for the holidays! Family is just now starting to see the light and some have apologized and come out of the darkness, but we are keeping *our* traditions now. They get to schedule around us or we just aren't there. Mostly they understand this. \n\nHere's a few we now do. One that we love to do is after Thanksgiving, we go and get the clear plastic (non breakable) ornaments and some art supplies or fun markers and decorate our own pack of Christmas ornaments. Our tree is mostly those now lol. For Thanksgiving we go out apple, pumpkin, or persimmon picking a week or so beforehand and plan out a dessert or food to make with our \"bounty\". One year was just sucky so we ended up making a home made cornucopia/horn of plenty for the table decoration. I don't recommend glitter spray on something that gets kinda moved around to get to various foods... also Christmas day is not to be encroached upon. It is our day. Phones are off, visitors not welcome. We stay in. Christmas eve is done by 6pm because we do our own before bed gift giving. New fresh pj's, a book, a mug and specialty hot coco mix/blend. Get ready for bed in our new jammies, make our decadent hot coco in the new mug, curl up with our book in a comfy spot and sip and read until we fall asleep. It is way more relaxing than the chaos that had been and we love our traditions!", "And make sure they never bring it up around the kids.", "I'm truly curious what a Space Name is.

My MIL suggested a name to me when I was expecting our first, which I thought was really annoying, but then she never mentioned it again.

OP's husband is old enough to have 3 kids, so probably in their 30s. The first Duggar child was born in 1988 and the first special didn't air until 2004. That's only 19 years ago. That's not long enough for them to base their child naming decisions on.", "My family has a tradition, going back 300 years plus, of naming the baby first name from father's side, middle name from mother's side.

Because we are not bat shit crazy.\n\n(Chose my daughter's name as a variant of my husband's.
