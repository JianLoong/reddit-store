It was a dinner at a local restaurant and my parents paid for the dinner, hers didn\u2019t show even though they were at the graduation ceremony and the invite was extended. Prior to the dinner, my brother asked that I interact with her so she could feel comfortable. During the dinner, it was very awkward, she\u2019d respond with short answers to my question, and every conversation I attempted to have with her was short lived. It was very clear she did not want to engage with me, that\u2019s fine I\u2019m also shy around new people. I also want to add that I live a state away, and drove to make this graduation, so casually meeting up with them was possible. (I don\u2019t do holidays due to working retail.  .if you know. . You know)\n\n\nMain story:  After the graduation party, we all went our separate ways, until recently her friend reached out to me via FB telling me about the bachelorette party they were planning, it was a weekend long event. I contacted my brother asking if this was his doing, and he confirmed that he wanted a member from his family to attend. It was a little odd to me because I, again, live a state over, has only interacted to Holly once, knew nothing about her, I did not know any of the other women attending and I was only invited because my brother asked her to invite me, not because she wanted me there. The invite was also extended very last minute (party is next weekend). I responded to the friend explaining that I did not want to attend, but I appreciated the offer. \nI can only assume the friend messaged Holly, and she contacted me very upset that I was \u201cruining her moment\u201d, I explained that I did not want to attend and spend the weekend with 6-7 women I did not know, I explained the \u201cparty line up\u201d was also outside of my comfort zone, very stereotypical drinking, club hopping, ect and since it is her moment she shouldn\u2019t have to invite someone she didn\u2019t know she had no intentions on inviting me to begin with. I explained that even if she only invited me because my brother asked, I was not obligated to accept and a bachelorette party should consist of her closest friends. She started to berate me during the call, to which I informed her I was done with the conversation \n\nShe ended the call by saying I was being an asshole, and stepping on her moment. My brother said I should have just accepted the invitation and stepped outside of my comfort zone, agreeing with his fianc\u00e9 that I am the asshole. She doesn\u2019t even want me to attend the wedding because she\u2019s scared I\u2019ll make it about it. My parents don\u2019t think my brother should have put me on the spot like that and are backing me on my decision. \n\nI\u2019m starting to think maybe I was the AH, and should have just accepted for my brothers sake\n\nEditing for clarification: Hollys friend ASKED if I wanted to attend, to which I responded I did not want to attend.", "created_utc": 1673770571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cehah/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_brothers/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your brother asked Holly to invite you then why was Holly upset that you weren't going?", "NTA.  Even if you did want to go, inviting you last minute shows that you weren't considered and only because your brother seems to not trust his fiance for some reason. Insisting a family member is there is kinda weird.\n\nParties like that aren't spontaneous and planned out  a week before, I guarantee her friends have known about it for months and would be surprised if they didn't. The last stag do I attended I knew about 6 months or maybe even 7 months before it happened. I probably would have declined too if I had only known about it a week before.\n\nAlso expecting someone to do something they aren't comfortable with isn't cool. Trying to make you feel bad about not wanting to is pretty toxic. You haven't \"ruined her moment\" that's a ridiculous thing to say. You barely even know her. Sounds to me like they have some weird relationship going on behind the scenes and I wouldn't get involved. At least your parents are backing you and you shouldn't feel bad about what you said, you were completely right.", "NTA because not only did she really not want you there, but also because the invitation was so last minute making it hard for you to make it work which is bad etiquette on her/the planner's part. \n\nJust because she's marrying your brother doesn't mean you have to jump through invisible hoops to appease either of them. From how she's behaving it almost seems like she's looking for things to justify her behavior towards you. \n\nEither way, you did nothing wrong & she's behaving like a bridezilla. If you not being at her Bachelorette party is really going to ruin it then there's a big problem imo.", "NTA \n\nIf it meant that much to them, either of them could\u2019ve reached out and said \u201cso we know you and Holly don\u2019t know each other that well yet but you\u2019re family and it would mean a lot to us both if you\u2019d attend her party\u201d. Instead, they had a friend FB stalk you to get in contact (even if said friend was in charge of organising the party, if Holly or brother had put OP on the invite list, commonsense would be to include a phone # or something). \n\nI\u2019m still baffled how having you decline an invite to a party with a bunch of people who don\u2019t know you is putting the spotlight on you? If your absence was brought up at all, a simple \u201cdrinking parties aren\u2019t really her scene, and/or she lives in another state\u201d would\u2019ve been sufficient to excuse you. \n\nIronically, uninviting the grooms sister to his wedding is probably going to raise more questions, and actually put a spotlight on you, than if you do attend.", "NTA. Your brother seems worried about the bachelorette party and I am guessing wants someone he knows, but who is unconnected to his fianc\u00e9e, there to supervise things. His apparent lack of trust in his wife is not a good sign considering his upcoming wedding.\n\nEdit: on second thought, it\u2019s possible I am reading too far into this. I\u2019ll leave this up anyway because it might be accurate.", "NTA\n\nIt's a bachelorette party. \"Stepping on her moment\"?! \ud83d\ude44Oh, come on. You've done nothing wrong here. Glad to hear the parents are backing you. Good luck to your brother!", "NTA- you don\u2019t know her well enough and you are not obliged to attend. You had a boundary and told them so and now they are mad they can\u2019t cross it. Don\u2019t worry about it", "NTA. I honestly don't understand how your brother expected you to go to a weekend long bachelorette with you not knowing anyone and with having the invite completely last minute. And what is that thing about ruining her moment? \ud83d\ude44 Holly and your brother are being unreasonable I believe.", "NTA, did the fianc\u00e9 ever really explain WHY she wanted you there? \n\nYou have no obligation to attend any event you dont want to, ever, no matter who'se event it is. Especially not if you dont know anyone else that is going to be there and were clearly only invited last minute out of obligation/appearances!", "NTA, but pls bribe the waiter to listen on that bacherette, they gon be trashing u", "Noooo. No no no. Everything you said in your post is 100% right, until that last bit where you're doubting yourself. There is no reason for you to go on a weekend full of events you won't enjoy, with people you don't know, a significant journey away - unless you want to, and you don't. Your brother just wanted you there to report back to him what she did, and if that's the level of trust he has for her that's not on you. Keeping your distance seems like a superb plan. NTA", " NTA & you don't even need to read past the headline to know that tbh", "NTA. Bachelorette parties are BS.. live your life. Do what you want.", "NTA\n\nIt might have been easier to just say that you couldn't make it rather than saying you didn't want to make it. But that ship has sailed. She didn't want you there in the first place so I'm not sure why she is upset that you won't be there. - It's possible she and your brother had a disagreement about inviting you in the first place and she's now upset that you've declined. But either way none of this is your problem. It was an invitation not a summons.", "NTA - what's wrong with them seriously? Your reasoning for not wanting to go to the party makes perfectly sense. Why banning you from the wedding? They both seem very immature. Are they that kind of people who thinks because it's their wedding everybody should do everything they asked them to? You're not asking to change the ceremony color theme to suit your tan, you are simply not comfortable going to the bachelorette party. They should get over themselves. Not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nWhile it'd have been better if you hadn't lectured her on who she should have invited, she should have respected your decision not to attend. Especially if you most likely wouldn't able to take the weekend off, judging from one of your comments.", "YTA - you don\u2019t decline an invitation by saying you don\u2019t want to attend. And in case you were thinking about saying it, \u201cI was just being honest\u201d is the universal motto of assholes.", "Why couldn\u2019t you just say \u201cI can\u2019t make it\u201d?", "ESH, I think, not for not accepting the invitation but the way you did it. The polite thing to do is say it's too short notice or make another excuse. But instead you said you didn't want to go, which is a rude way to reject an invitation. Then you went on what sounds like a judgemental rant about how stupid it is to enjoy yourself and go drinking and club hopping. It may not have sounded like that to you, but that's how it reads here so I bet you gave that impression as well.\n\nNow of course the fiance is also being ridiculous and you shouldn't insist people you barely know come to a bachelorette party, although by and large it's fairly common. It's *also* possible that your brother insisted you be invited and made a big deal of it, which would make him also an AH for not discussing it with you earlier. And in my opinion unless you murder someone there's no excuse for not having a sibling at your wedding. But you didn't do yourself any favours here.", "Nta funny how you were expected to interact but she couldn\u2019t do it the first time you met. I don\u2019t see this marriage lasting more then a decade", "YTA. From the way you've spoke in this post, i'm going to assume there was a pretty good reason she was so short with you when you first met. You seem the type to say hurtful negative things with no regard for others and then just say \"What, I was just being honest\" like that gives you a right to be a d**k. \n\nFyi, if you don't want to attend an event, have the decency to make an excuse up like every normal person does.", "YTA for how you viewed the invite and how you responded. You\u2019re going to have very little contact with your brother and future nieces and nephews if you continue to treat his wife like a stranger.", "YTA. Honesty without kindness is just cruelty. \n\nYou work in retail. Answer \"Wow! That sounds really fun! I wish I had known sooner. Unfortunately I work that weekend and it's too late to change shifts. I'll be there in spirit! Have a good time!\" \n\nDone. You don't go. You don't have to deal with people you don't know. You salvaged good feelings by putting the blame on work.", "ESH. Who are you to tell her who she should invite to her party? Even with you try to write what you said as if you said it calmly and reasonably (I doubt it) it still comes across judgemental and rude. You had no obligation to go and phoning you to tell you off is definitely an asshole move, but it doesn't sound like you thanked her for the invite and said no nicely.", "ESH they can't expect you to go, especially considering the short notice and all the other factors. For them to expect you to be available the whole of the next weekend when you work in retail is not good. \n\nHowever, a simple 'Sorry I can't make it' would have been more polite. You could have elaborated on your lack of availability instead of focussing on the parts of the invite that didn't appeal to you, but you chose to offend. \n\nInstead, you decided to tell your future SIL's friend that the one member of her new family that was invited didn't want to go. She had to hear that second hand and is probably lashing out through humiliation.\n\nI expect if you had been more tactful the backlash wouldn't have happened.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Along the way the argument becomes less that and more blaming you for saying no. Now they have a joint \"enemy\" instead of fighting each other.

Thats a great way to start a relationship?\ud83d\ude05\n\nIts total BS that we somehow have to justify why we dont want to attend something, or lie about it all together..\nWe all have different things we like and dont like, people need to deal with that or p*ss off...", "Because she didn't feel comfortable attending a party in another state with a handful of females she doesn't know? If she loses brother over that, that makes brother the asshole.", "Genuine question: if she was trying to get to know why. . Why wait a week before the party to have her friend send the invite? Why not invite me personally? \n\nI could understand if everything was supposed to be a surprise for the bride to be, but none of it was.", "Reading comprehension isn\u2019t your thing, huh?", "That's just how some people do it - the bridesmaids organise. I don't understand that personally but it's definitely not unusual. You shouldn't automatically assume bad intentions, and you definitely don't need to be rude just because you're assuming bad intentions.", "Reading comprehension is very much my thing, thanks \ud83d\ude0a I didn't disagree with the fact that OP didn't need to react the way they did, I'm just adding to my previous point. If you don't like my opinion, cool. OP is NTA no matter what way you look at it.", "Thanks for your feedback! I appreciate it!"]}
