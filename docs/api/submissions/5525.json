I work in retail so this is a hectic time of year for me and she had just gone home to her family for Christmas.\n\nI finished working a 12 hour shift without breaks. I had to completely redesign the shop floor for the Christmas sale so was running about all over the place. I get home at 23:30 and just fall straight asleep- getting some much needed rest in before I need to get up at 7am and do it all again. \n\nI wake up to a phone call at 2:30 from my girlfriend who is very drunk. She starts doing the usual drunk call thing and doing silly dances, it\u2019s all very cute. After a few minutes I tiredly ask her if I can please go to sleep as I need to get some rest and I\u2019m shattered. \n\nI hear her friends in the background say \u201coh let him go you\u2019ve woken him up and he\u2019s got work tomorrow\u201d to which she replies \u201cno he\u2019s my little bitch boy he\u2019ll stay on the call, besides he keeps me up every night so he can deal with this\u201d (she is referring to my sleep apnea that I\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with and currently awaiting treatment for)\n\nI say I\u2019ll stay on the phone until she gets home just to make sure she\u2019s safe but then I really need to get some rest. When she gets home she tells me I was being rude and starts calling me names like \u201cprick\u201d and \u201cfucking asshole\u201d- I\u2019ve told her before it really upsets me when she does this as I would never dream of speaking to her that way, and ask her please not to speak to me like that. I\u2019m struggling with my mental health at the moment and am constantly negative towards myself and she knows this.\n\nShe continues having a go at me, so I said I\u2019ll talk to her in the morning when she is sober. The morning comes and I get a text from her telling me she\u2019s was drunk and I wasn\u2019t being fair on her and making her out to be the bad guy. She tells me to stop being dramatic and playing the victim. I don\u2019t trust myself and I\u2019m doubting am I entitled to feel this way? Or am I just being too sensitive?
