Yesterday, I went out to lunch with my husband and some friends and brought the baby along. The restaurant was a trendy gastropub type place. Think $15-$20 burgers in a high cost of living area. We\u2019ve eaten here a couple times a month for the past 6 years and there are often families with kids here, so it\u2019s not like we took the baby to a kid-free environment. We were seated on the outdoor patio. \n\nFor the first 30 or so minutes of us being there, the baby sat on my lap making quiet baby noises. At one point, he started to fuss so I got up to take him away from the restaurant to calm him down. Because I know people are going to ask, this is exactly what happened: \n\n1. Baby starts to fuss\n\n2. I stood up and grabbed a pacifier and blanket out of my bag\n\n3. Baby started crying about halfway between the table and patio exit\n\nHad what happened next not happened, the baby would have been crying in the restaurant for no more than 20 seconds. As I\u2019m exiting the patio, someone from another table called out to get my attention. Thinking he was trying to tell me that I dropped something, I started looking at the floor around me. He yelled again to get my attention and said something to the effect of, \u201cNo one wants to hear your baby. You\u2019re not fucking special.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a confrontational person, so I just turned around a left. Once the baby had calmed down, I came back in the restaurant. The man tried to get my attention again but I just walked past him and ignored him. The baby didn\u2019t fuss for the rest of the meal but we got dirty looks from the man and his date until they left. \n\nI ran this by some of my mom friends and they\u2019re split. Some say he was an ass, some say that I shouldn\u2019t have taken the baby out until he was older, and some say that they don\u2019t take their kids out to eat at all because it\u2019s rude to other people. I\u2019m looking for a wider variety of opinions here, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1682366896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xulsa/aita_for_bringing_my_baby_to_a_restaurant/", "score": 4363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can take your baby places, it's not radioactive.", "NTA. If this place is kid-friendly, bringing your baby in isn't violating some social norm. This guy acted like a complete A-H.", "NTA. Sounds like you were more than considerate, went to a restaurant where kids are allowed, removed baby to soothe them etc... and it's not like a 4 month old can run around slobbering on random strangers food \ud83d\ude44. \n\nKids exist and are a part of society, people who have zero tolerance can isolate themselves to kid free areas if they are so inclined.", "NTA. IMO lunch time is for kids, especially on the patio. A high end restaurant at night is the only time I don't expect to find young children. You didn't even disturb anyone, as soon as your baby got fussy, you left to calm the baby down. It shows more about the person who will complain about a baby than it does about the mom. Like you're an adult, but can't keep calm? Maybe he shouldn't be out in public.", "NTA. Babies are allowed to exist in the public space and you took him out immediately when he started fussing. It's not a space or a time when people can reasonably expect a childfree experience. He was being an ass.", "NTA.  You\u2019re a parent, not a hermit.  You deserve to have a life (and a burger).", "NTA\n\nHow are kids supposed to learn how to behave if we always leave them at home? You behaved appropriately when your baby started to fuss. I wouldn't ask more of any parent.", "NTA you\u2019re perfectly entitled to take your newborn out to lunch with you in a child friendly place. If he has a problem, he could go to a place that doesn\u2019t cater for kids.", "NTA - he was entirely rude. If you dont want to hear babies, dont go out in public.", "NTA - Sounds like he was looking for someone to be an asshole to and you were the one he picked on first.", "NTA. It\u2019s pissing me off so much seeing commenters and people in general thinking babies don\u2019t belong in certain public places. Nothing entitles you to a child free experience of the world, and if you hate children to the point where you can\u2019t be around them in public or display empathy towards parents: you need therapy. It is so sad seeing people be so void of simple empathy.", "NTA - While it's true that people often don't want to hear a baby cry at a restaurant, it also reads as though you removed the crying child quickly. You were very considerate, IMO and there's nothing to feel like an AH about.", "NTA. He was very rude to say that. I can understand if in a movie theater or a live performance but not the setting you described.", "NTA.  Older kids cry too and throw tantrums that may result in being carried out of situations in a football hold.    Are parents just supposed to never take their children anywhere in case they make noise?  We live in a society and that includes people of all ages.   Even babies.", "NTA you went out when he was crying and came back in when he wasn\u2019t. Yes he cried a bit but that happens. The guy sounds like the crazy childless adults that hate kids for even remotely acting like a kid.", "NTA\n\nCrying babies are annoying, sure, but you were doing your level best to remove your baby from the area. It's not like you just left them to cry in their stroller while you ignored them and chatted away. \n\nYou don't have to be locked in your house just because you're a new parent.", "NTA\n\nObviously a baby is going to make some noise, but as long as you are keeping it somewhat reasonable and making an effort, seems fine.  Especially at a gastro-pub... it's not exactly fine dining.\n\nI just hate it when people go to a restaurant with their kids and just let them go crazy and don't make any effort to control them.", "NTA\nFrom your description, children are welcome at that restaurant. So no problems there.\nYou also did the exact right thing by taking your child away from the patio until they had calmed down.", "Nta. \"Sir, you do not get to dictate who can and can't eat here - you are not special.\" \n\nI mean, if you'd let the baby wail and done nothing then obviously that's different but you dealt with it.", "The only obnoxious thing about a crying baby in a normal restaurant is when the parent doesn't take the baby outside to soothe them.  You did the cordial and thoughtful thing I would expect if I was eating next to your table.\n\nIgnore that AH, I wish all parents were like you.\n\nNTA", "No, you're NTA... You'd be the asshole if you just sat there and let the baby cry. But you're a reasonable person and obviously didn't do that, so you walked away to care for your baby... The other people should just stay home if they don't want other people around.", "NTA, you just happened to be in the same restaurant as what I assume was a 20-30 year old baby.", "NTA. I brought my kid to places when they were a few weeks old. My husband or I would take baby out if any fussing occurred.  The sooner you \"socialize\" baby to the public the better. I've never subscribed to the idea baby has to stay home. \n\nThere are few exceptions, like fancy super duper restaurants that require a dress code. Also, movie theaters unless it's a kids movie. \n\nWhat's not acceptable is bringing an infant to a 10pm showing of a r rated movie on Friday night. Yeah, that happened to me.  I got a babysitter and hubby and I had a date, only to be ruined by an infant who wouldn't stop fussing at a late movie showing.", "Babies have the right to exist in spaces too. It\u2019s not like you sat there and watched your baby cry and did nothing. He was a major jerk, and i would be appalled if i was his date. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You were literally taking the baby out of the restaurant to avoid disturbing the other customers. Dude was an ass.", "As a childfree person that loathes screamy babies in restaurants and everywhere else, NTA. You were taking the baby out of the restaurant to calm him down, which is the right and considerate thing to do. That guy is just a jerk.", "NTA, you did everything you could. Kids have the right to be in public spaces. If that guy hates kids so much, maybe he should stay home.", "NTA.\nOutdoor lunch on the patio is the perfect spot to take babies. As shocking as it may seem to some, apparently, children do not wake up one day with restaurant manners. They learn them slowly and early exposure helps.\n\nYou did all the right things. \nDon\u2019t drink his poison.", "People. Are. Not. Entitled. To. A. Baby. Free. World.   \n\n\nNTA. Obviously there are boundaries to this and some parents suck for sure- but you did everything right and he sounds like a d-bag.", "the only doofus was the guy who was pestering you. Yiu were considerate and did everything correctly.", "NTA\n\nThat man was the AH. You could have told him to Go F\\*ck himself in response and I would say you were in the right.", "NTA\n\nIt is actually highly important for child development for them to be socialized from a young age, including infants.  The younger they learn how to navigate socially the more successful they tend to be as adults.  And I don't mean in the career or academic sense specifically, but in the social and civil sense.  And it is especially important when it comes to developing self-esteem and competence.\n\nSo, yeah.  It was the right choice to remove the baby from the patio while fussy.  And then return once his needs were met and his emotions were regulated again.   That person who was making a fuss probably should have excused himself to regulate his fussiness instead of making an issue out of something that was already being addressed appropriately.", "is not like you stayed right next to that man with a crying baby. you did your best to not annoy people at the restaurant, but can't control when the baby will cry. nta in my opinion", "NTA, and to be clear, what you did is 100% not what others have done who ARE the AH. You were literally on your way out to remove your crying baby from the general public when the asshole dude stopped you. If you had sat there with your baby unhappy and crying, you'd have been the AH.", "NTA - you did the right thing in this situation.", "NTA  \nYou did the appropriate actions and it doesn't seem like that place is going to be quiet anyways. That guy, 100% is an asshole. He had no reason to get into your business as you handled it as best as possible.", "If it's a 120$ a plate , gotta wear Jacket and Tie, kind of place maybe....maybe you'd be the AH.  But definitely not in this situation.  What's really weird is that most people have kids and they'd probably ignore anyone else if they had brought their kids, but for whatever strange reason they decided that this PUBLIC place all of a sudden needs to be THEIR place.  Weird social disconnect.  You did the right thing by ignoring them.  It's always best to let fools be fools all by themselves.", "NTA-the guy definitely was one though.", "NTA. People bring children literally everywhere where I come from.  Especially in the summer.", "NTA\n\nBabies are welcome at restaurants and you were already remedying the situation. He was absolutely the AH and probably just wanted to look impressive to his date that he can shut down an infant being an infant.\n\nI take mine out in public from birth on, they learn faster how to behave in public situations through experience.", "Sorry for the negative awards some weirdo gave you. NTA", "NTA. You did the same thing we always did. When fussy one of us would exit until our little one was back to being happy. We did that from birth till around 3ish when they could be seriously entertained with coloring or a small quiet toy.  You may not be confrontational, but you could have spoken to the hostess or a manager and let them know the a$$ was being verbally harassing to you. Even if they only spoke to him, at least he would\u2019ve been put in his place.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. You did the right thing. Baby cried and you took them out to calm down.", "NTA. So what are you supposed to do for the next 18 years while your child grows up? Live like a hermit on a mountain top until he's 18?\n\nTake your baby with you, do as you did and go outside when baby fusses, and tell interfering old (because they're usually old) busy-bodies to get their stickies out of your business.", "NTA at all.\n\nNo one does want to hear a baby cry, which is why thoughtful and aware parents remove their child from the space when they start crying. You did exactly right.\n\nSome people are just AHs. A bit ironic too for him to say YOURE not special, when he\u2019s so fragile that he can\u2019t handle a baby being a baby for less than a minute", "NTA. He was being entitled. Babies cry. He's just an asshole.", "Wow.  I am a child free asshole and I think that guy was out of line.  I would have seen you come in and been concerned, but then relieved that the baby was well behaved.  When the baby fussed and you immediately brought him out, I would have thanked my lucky stars how considerate you were being.", "NTA, I'm a server and have worked in restaurants for my whole adult life. You did the right thing and removed yourself from the dining room with a fussy baby. That guy can fuck off", "NTA. babies are people too. The baby started crying and you took him out until he was settled. You did nothing wrong. That guy was a jerk. Hearing a baby cry for 20 seconds isn't going to kill anyone.", "NTA. I can\u2019t think of a way this could have been better handled. It wasn\u2019t a child free environment and you took a fussy baby out swiftly. Expecting parents to be on lockdown with a baby is a fast track to PPD. Expecting them to always get a sitter every time they want to leave the house is also ridiculous. This anti children movement is getting to be a bit much.", "NTA\n\nThe person who called out at you was/is the obvious asshole. The man was going out of his way to prolong the time you and the crying baby were there. He clearly felt that he was very special and everyone wanted to hear his opinion shouted out. Some people are just shitty people.", "NTA, this is a restaurant not a movie theatre, people are not expected to be quiet there.", "NTA\n\nThat customer was special alright, especially entitled.  I would have complained to the manager of the establishment about that customer.", "NTA. You did it right, and the other guy was a jerk.", "Nta", "NTA you were going to lunch at a pretty relaxed establishment, and you started taking your baby outside when he started crying.", "NTA - Some people, like that man, are just looking for something to be an AH about. I wouldn't take his weird interjection and dirty looks as a personal judgment.", "NTA. If someone has a problem dealing with common noises in public, then they shouldn't go out in public. You did exactly what you should have done and honestly handled better than most would have. I, for example, would have handed my husband the baby and then ripped the guy's face off, but I *am* confrontational. You're doing great, mom. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", ">\u201cNo one wants to hear your baby. You\u2019re not fucking special.\u201d  \n\nAnd good sir know one wants you're particular brand of human near them. \n\nNTA You are, despite what some entitled loud mouthed people think, entitled to function outside of your house, in public and public places with a baby. Cretins like this and their opinions are unwelcome. You are all good, you should not be penalized for having a baby.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly a family friendly place from how you describe it and most importantly you took the baby away from the area as soon as they started fussing. Honestly my brother and SIL took their son out to bars and restaurants from a very early age and it meant he learned very early on how to behave in restaurants. When we had a big party for my mom\u2019s 60th he was 2 and everyone, including the waitresses, were really impressed at how well behaved he was.", "NTA.  Yes, crying babies and children can be annoying, but that\u2019s life and you were literally walking out.  I would much rather listen to a baby crying in a restaurant than some boorish, rude jerk yelling profanities at a mother and her infant.  What a jerk!!!  Kudos for keeping your cool and not throwing a dirty diaper in his face.", "NTA.   I find crying  babies  less disruptive  than a table of noisy drunks.\nPeople talk loud, babies fuss.  Its a public place and he wasn't  crying for a solid 5 min", "NTA. \n\nIf the restaurant didn't allow babies, that'd be different. You did everything you reasonably can be expected to do.  \n\nMr. Sensitive-Ears needs to take his date to a private place if he doesn't want to deal with hearing noise from other members of the public.  Hope his date ghosted him.\n\nI guarantee you his AH-ish outburst made others more uncomfortable than your briefly crying baby.", "NTA. That dude was just a psycho.", "NTA but that guy sure was, and as a father I would have let him know he was a giant ass too.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds as if the guy was drunk. It is perfectly ok to bring a baby to a restaurant. Baby cried, you went outside. Perfect.\n\nIf you were making other diners uncomfortable, wouldn\u2019t the restaurant management have said something?\n\nIgnore the rude person.\n\nETA: the only reason you are questioning this is because you are new to being a mom. Give it a couple years, and you will know, and possibly say, that guy can fuck right off.", "NTA. He was being a boorish lout.", "Looks like you met a Redditor in the wild lol\n\nNTA", "NTA. As someone who had crippling PND, I think it\u2019s really important that we normalise new Mums being out with babies. My house became a very dark place after my first daughter was born. Seeing people and having some normality helped me through. And probably saved my life. You did nothing wrong and were trying to be considerate. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "You are NTA. I\u2019m sorry you had that experience. You left when baby got fussy. You were being respectful of everyone in there. You came back when baby calmed down. That was completely fine to do as well. \n\nLooks like that man is so miserable, he has to take it out on someone. That\u2019s no excuse to take it out on anyone, especially you. I\u2019m sorry", "NTA, honestly I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that man didn\u2019t get another date. The only thing you did wrong here was not informing the staff of the mans harassment. They definitely would\u2019ve made him leave and probably banned him from coming back. In my experience working in hospitality this is how he would\u2019ve been handled. They also probably would\u2019ve comped your meal or gotten you a drink on the house. He absolutely should not have been allowed to harass you especially so blatantly. I\u2019m curious as to if any staff were around/aware of what happened? If so and they did nothing you should call and ask to speak to a manager because staff absolutely should\u2019ve stood in to protect you. This is part of the job for FOH to weed out unpleasant customers who ruin the ambiance of the restaurant. Unfortunately people like that think they are in the right especially when no action is taken to address their behavior. He will most likely repeat this behavior to another mom. Fortunately you held your head high and continued to carry on but a lot of women may have been reduced to tears because of this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate to bring a baby/children to a restaurant as long as they aren\u2019t crying/running around unsupervised. However 3 months is pretty young to start doing so given your baby barely has an immune system. Sitting outside was a good move. Children are the most important part of society and they are humans. We should always treat them in a way that demonstrates the behavior of an upstanding adult. People that think it\u2019s okay to shit on kids are some of the worst kinds of abusers.", "If there's a kid's menu, it's child friendly. You took your kid out when they started to fuss and came back when they were settled. You were considerate of the other patrons. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - You did exactly what a person should do with a crying baby in restaurant. You didn't ignore your baby's cry, you didn't try to sooth your baby at your seat (which again depending on how long they would cry, it's not a bad thing). You got up, walked away not to bother anyone and then came back when the baby was quiet. \n\nYou should be the example and norm not the exception.", "Life hack for people who really hate babies or just can\u2019t deal with them today, GO TO A BAR or stay home. They have places where babies are not allowed, it\u2019s called a bar.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to take a baby to a restaurant. And sometimes they fuss and you gotta deal with it and whatever. I always liked slightly louder places because it\u2019s not as obvious when the baby is fussing but either way, it\u2019s perfectly normal to bring a baby to a restaurant", "NTA. Babies exist. They\u2019re allowed to exist in public too! I am pretty noise sensitive as noise can trigger my migraines. I\u2019ve NEVER been in a restaurant where someone kept their crying baby in the restaurant inappropriately\u2014they leave quickly (like you did) and return when baby is calm (I presume, I don\u2019t really watch for them). Grown adult men being too loud for an environment, on the other hand\u2026well that\u2019s a different story. \n\nAlso you clearly have a sense of when is and isn\u2019t appropriate to have your baby. You mentioned at night you wouldn\u2019t go to that restaurant as it\u2019s more of a bar vibe. To me that says you get that some environments are more conducive to having a baby with you, and you choose to go to appropriate places at appropriate times.", "I'm childfree but people need to appreciate kids in public more. Especially those of us without kids are still going to need future generations. I'm going to need doctors and inventors and pilots and every other service in the world and it's young people that are going to be doing it and hopefully making my life better. So the least we can do is allow them to exist in society. Just out of human decency, if anyone you're dining with no matter the age is making noise for an extended period of time - do as you did and remove them from the situation temporarily but even if you can't, like on a plane, life will go on. Yes, it's unpleasant. But it would also be unpleasant to not have a future generation or to have a future generation of kids raised hidden away from society bc they are loud and annoying sometimes. They're new here, they'll figure it out. Well, they won't all. Like for example, apparently the man who yelled at you at the restaurant never grew up.", "Yeah NTA. Had you let the baby scream uncontrollably inside the restaurant without a care then it would be different but you immediately sensed what was about to happen, took the baby aside to sooth him/her, and then came back. Babies are a fact of life. If someone wants to act like their fucking allergic to babies then they can fucking stay home. He was a dick for what he did. If I was on a date with a guy who did that, it would be my cue to get my check and get the fuck out. He\u2019s a rude AH", "NTA - I personally wouldn't take a baby that young to a restaurant like that, but that's just my opinion/choice \n\nGiven the circumstances, you done everything right!", "NTA. While children can be irritating, people understand intellectually that the child is not at fault; the fault lies with a negligent parent, and you were considerate.", "Dude I am so taken aback by that. And he was on a date? Or at least had a lady friend with him? I hope she runs far away. You are so NTA here. I would have thrown something at him.", "NTA. What you did was perfect. Those people were horribly rude.", "NTA\u2026 I\u2019m honestly sickened by this uptick in kid hate recently. \u201cKids can\u2019t be on plane, kids can\u2019t be at a restaurant\u201d what\u2019s next kids can\u2019t be born?! Expecting parents to stay in hiding until their children are at least 5 is INSANE. Cause that\u2019s basically what people are expecting. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. You did everything right. Hopefully that man wakes up with incurable pink eye or something \ud83d\ude12", ">I ran this by some of my mom friends and they\u2019re split.\n\nSeriously?? This is wild to me. You're allowed to live your life. Nobody likes it when a baby starts hysterically crying or screaming in a public place, but it's not like you were in a movie theatre or a library. You handled this exactly how you're supposed to and that guy was completely out of line.", "NTA, fuck that guy.", "NTA \n\nI see so many of these posts and I truly wonder why people are so mean to parents with small children and pregnant people. This generation being born is very likely the generation that will be changing AHs like that man\u2019s diaper in an old age home AND carry him economically by paying taxes. If not the current generation being born it would be the one after that if he is lucky. \n\nPeople need to be more kind. \n\nYou did an excellent job.", "NTA\n\nNormally I hate kids in any kind of environment thats not specifically for kids, but that's because most parents don't do what you did.

You were considerate of others and the guy was definitely over the line", "Its not that fancy of a place. If you took your baby to a place with $50 a plate or more Id say your a asshole. But this is just a nicer normal restaurant. Your kid is allowed and its not out of the social norm to have them in a place like that. That man was a asshole.", "You did nothing wrong. Mister Man was a jerk. Next time, find your voice and tell him to go fuck himself.", "NTA, it's a public place so that asshole should've expected people with kids and at least a response \"neither are you\".", "Is it a cultural thing to expect restaurants to be completely quiet? I get it if it's a high end place, but taking your baby out to eat isn't frowned upon where I live. As long as you don't let them run wild or they scream without getting them to stop, we have to allow children in our public spaces. We have to allow some noise from them as well, as long as it is being handled by an adult and they remove the child if they can't get them to stop being disruptive. Yes, it's annoying for the rest of us when babies cry. Also, this is what we occationally have to deal with if we decide to eat among 50 other people.  NTA.", "Nope. NTA. He was the clear AH here.", "NTA - if they've got a kids' menu then it's fair game to take a baby there. You did what you could to calm the baby down, rather than sitting there and making other people listen to the crying.", "As long as its not a child free space and you actually gave a damn about the kids wellbeing this will always be NTA (said by a person who doesn't like children and finds screaming babies annoying lol)", "NTA.

Staff didn't do anything ? Idk  anywhere where a guy saying that loudly to a mom with a baby wouldn't cause some problems for him.

Yesterday, I went out to lunch with my husband and some friends and brought the baby along. The restaurant was a trendy gastropub type place. Think $15-$20 burgers in a high cost of living area. We\u2019ve eaten here a couple times a month for the past 6 years and there are often families with kids here, so it\u2019s not like we took the baby to a kid-free environment. We were seated on the outdoor patio. \n\nFor the first 30 or so minutes of us being there, the baby sat on my lap making quiet baby noises. At one point, he started to fuss so I got up to take him away from the restaurant to calm him down. Because I know people are going to ask, this is exactly what happened: \n1. Baby starts to fuss\n3. I stood up and grabbed a pacifier and blanket out of my bag\n3. Baby started crying about halfway between the table and patio exit\n\nHad what happened next not happened, the baby would have been crying in the restaurant for no more than 20 seconds. As I\u2019m exiting the patio, someone from another table called out to get my attention. Thinking he was trying to tell me that I dropped something, I started looking at the floor around me. He yelled again to get my attention and said something to the effect of, \u201cNo one wants to hear your baby. You\u2019re not fucking special.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a confrontational person, so I just turned around a left. Once the baby had calmed down, I came back in the restaurant. The man tried to get my attention again but I just walked past him and ignored him. The baby didn\u2019t fuss for the rest of the meal but we got dirty looks from the man and his date until they left. \n\nI ran this by some of my mom friends and they\u2019re split. Some say he was an ass, some say that I shouldn\u2019t have taken the baby out until he was older, and some say that they don\u2019t take their kids out to eat at all because it\u2019s rude to other people. I\u2019m looking for a wider variety of opinions here, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most people are not going to give you a hard time about it if they can see you're trying to teach them better.\n\nAs far as babies go, OP did exactly right.

Please just continue with your regular lives while your baby sleeps. If you keep everything extremely quiet then you  are the one who has trained your baby to only sleep when everything is very quiet.
