Other guests would have been appalled that you went to a festive event so soon after your husbands death.  They would have gossiped about you, questioning your loyalty and devotion to him.\n2.  At least one butthead would act loudly offended when you refuse to participate in trying to catch the bouquet.\n3.  The rest of the guests would criticize you for having a negative impact on the celebration because you couldn\u2019t hide your sadness.\n4.  Relatives would have asked you, in front of many others, how much life insurance you got.\n5.

How could they expect you to put on a happy face so soon after such a devastating loss?\n\nThey obviously only care about the wedding, so it's up to you to take care of you. You're not \"ruining the wedding\", you're literally picking up the pieces of the life you expected to have.\n\nYour sister's attitude is just the worst - talk about zero compassion. On the bright side, if she keeps up that sort of behavior you'll probably be feeling okay in time to go to her next wedding.", "Wow, your family is full of horrible people. Absolutely NTA!!!

Five days after the loss of a spouse you're supposed to go to a big celebration? If this were my wedding, I'd have postponed it. He's *her* family, too! I would not have been able to dress up and dance around all smiles right after my BIL just DIED at the age of 26!!!

You aren\u2019t just grieving the loss of a best friend but of an entire life. I am so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine the pain you are in!!! It is totally understandable that you decided to miss your sister\u2019s wedding. I can\u2019t even begin to process in my head how you would handle that and I\u2019m not in your shoes.

Wh\ufffcen news of the passing reached the family, everything was cancelled and we had a small wake instead. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your sister necessarily should have postponed her wedding, but it\u2019s legitimately shocking how they\u2019ve treated you since your husband passed.

But you were in a no win situation. \n\nEither you went and weren't going to be as engaged with the wedding as she would have liked/stolen the spotlight as the young widow being brave attending her sister's wedding or you were going to stay at home and mourn. There was no correct choice here expect for whichever brought you peace in that moment. \n\nTurn your phone off for the time being OP.

Lots of assholes in your environment, though. Losing your partner and mourning the loss excuses you from any and all social obligations for a year and a day (with the exception of a visit from your sovereign if you live in a monarchy) or so I was told according to Victorian rules. Your sister is not royalty and her wedding is not a command performance. Take all the time you need to sit with your grief and your memories and if it's not what your family likes, block their numbers until you can bear to deal with them. I am truly sorry for your loss and wish you strength for the future.", "NTA. Two weeks isn't a lot of time to wrap your head around what happened and take care of urgent things when it comes to death.

I give you permission to block them, all of them, until you are ready to accept their apologies.  You don't have to apologize or excuse yourself.  You don't have to forgive them.

I will let if you know if that ever happens.\"", "OMG what have I just read?! Of course you are NTA, you have lost your husband, the love of your life for God sake. Not only do you have to deal with the trauma and grief of your sudden loss, you have your family, who should have at least a modicum of compassion, piling on and abusing you - shouting is emotionally abusive behaviour- as if what is happening is nothing.

OMG, although you are a I'm am absolutely raging and appalled at the treatment to which you are being subjected.\n\nYou do what is right for you, don't be bullied into doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable. \n\nLastly OP, I'm so sorry for your loss, and sending you virtual hugs from the UK", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.", "WHAT THE FUCK! Seriously wtf is wrong with your entire family. They are all inconsiderate and insensitive assholes. I would block every last person that was not in support of you during such a tremendous loss.

I hope your family can take a step back and see the big picture.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, and also sorry that your family are a bunch of inconsiderate assholes that thonk grieving for the recent death of a partner is considered \u201csitting on your ass doing nothing.\u201d That is just fucking callous", "NTA\n\nObviously.\n\nI'm always curious about these scenarios where extended families are \"blowing up my phone\". I can't fathom multiple people harassing a widow b/c of \\*checks notes\\* someone else's wedding.", "NTA.   \nYour family are MASSIVE AHs. You just lost your husband and they expect you to attend a wedding, a celebration, whilst you are deep in mourning?

Man, this situation they are putting you in pisses me off the more I think about it.", "Your sister is clearly TA. Everyone greaves differently and your way of grieving this major loss is ok.

Were you supposed to officiate said wedding? Maid of honor? In charge of the guest book perhaps?

You are absolutely NTA", "NTA - Can you have a friend or someone from your husband\u2019s family screen calls for you? You need a strong gatekeeper!

What exactly are they saying to you as they \"try and reason\" with you? \"We know yours is dead but your sister's-to-be isn't and witnessing them marry is more important\"? \n\nThese people don't care about you, and I'm so sorry that's the kind of family you're saddled with. Maybe this is too drastic but I'd say cut them off. \n\nDefinitely NTA. Everyone else in this scenario sure is though. \n\nAlso, please stop apologizing, your husband just died and that's more than a valid reason to not attend a wedding.", "Sorry for your loss.  I hope you show these comments to your family because they suck. All of them.  Turn of our devices and grieve the loss of you hubby.  Shame on them.  Let me guess your sister is the favorite.

I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through, but it took my mother a month to leave her bubble after my dad died. Grieve.

Anger for missing a wedding DAYS after the death of a spouse?\r Accusing you of ruining their wedding and not being considerate is insane.

It sucks to miss that important event but you weren't feeling fine at that moment.", "NTA.  Holy shit, less than two weeks after your husband of four years passed away they want you to act happy at a wedding?  That is not enough time to grieve and forcing you to sit through a wedding while thinking about what you lost is horrible.  Your family is very unsupportive.  Yes, it sucks for your sister, but it sucks more for you.  Sorry for your loss.  Two weeks is not enough time to grieve a husband passing.", "This is so insane I have to wonder if it's even real.", "Holy fuck NTA and fuck your whole ass family. Go no contact. Who the fuck screams at a woman who just lost her spouse. Fuck them. They should be SUPPORTING you not crying because of a missed wedding wtf. I'd humiliate them publicly.

They'll just cause you more pain. I'm sorry for your loss.", "Nobody said you had to put a smile on your face. You could have gone just to be there as hard as it would have been.

And piss on everyone enabling it", "and then the bride would have complained that \"OP took the spotlight away from her and made the day all about her\"\n\nthere is no pleasing horrible people", "Who wants to bet sister is the golden child?", "Does her husband know she's pulling this? I'd like to see what he thinks of his future wife's behavior.", "> How could they expect you to put on a happy face so soon after such a devastating loss?\n\nBecause people die daily so they living need to keep living and can instantly feel better and support other living lives ones.

What an enormous tragedy!\n\nExcellent way to spell it out.", "And a wedding no less!", "Some can do it when they DO show up...", "Five days even!

The only way to ruin a wedding is if the bride and groom don't get married! (and sometimes that may be the better option)", "No one knoes if you even have a MOH until she shows up. I've been to weddings that didn't have one and no one questioned or gossiped about it at all. \n\nGranted, these were all weddings for grown adults who acted like it. I can't imagine behaving like that at 27 over a party.", "I\u2019m so close to my sisters (the way OP described) and I would be devastated.

If she had a close relationship with her sister, she could have the empathy to understand the loss, and would have a hard time carrying on with the wedding like nothing happened.", "He might well not even have been buried yet, plenty of funerals occur a week or two after the death", "Can we also talk about the awful irony (?) that they are mad she isn\u2019t coming to a wedding cause she\u2019s grieving her husband. Like she picked her wishful life partner well and shouldn\u2019t these people - who about to be married/just married should be happiest in their relationship - understand that the loss of losing the person at the alter with them?\n\nLike get over your husband and come to my wedding. Is that how OPs sister and BIL feel? If they\u2019re so comfortable with thinking people should celebrate a new marriage just after a heartbreaking loss of theirs then I have to question the integrity of their feelings for each other. If they would act the same way they\u2019re telling OP to then they\u2019ve made a mistake. \n\n(I hope this makes sense lol)\n\nBut NTA OP and sending you support in your rough time"]}
