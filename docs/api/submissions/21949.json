My husband passed away 2 weeks ago from an underlying heart problem and my heart has been shattered. \n\nMy sister (27f) was engaged to her fianc\u00e9 (29m) for about a year. They had dreamed of a big wedding together and so they worked very hard to make it possible. \nMe and my husband were so excited to go to said wedding and we were so happy for them. Me and my sister were always close and we always dreamt of getting married so our weddings were big deals to us.\n\nUnfortunately, 8 days before the wedding, my husband was rushed to the hospital. I sat at his bedside the entire time. It pained to see him suffer and I wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy. 3 days after he was brought in, he passed away.\n\nI have been grieving the loss of my best friend since then. I called my sister to tell her the news and told her that I might not make it to the wedding. She then screamed at me through the phone saying that I was ruining her big day for me to just sit around doing nothing. Although I understand how she feels, I can\u2019t put myself through the pain of plastering a smile on my face so soon after losing him. \n\nMy parents called me the next day trying to reason with me. I felt bad about missing something as big as this but I genuinely couldn\u2019t pressurise myself to go.  \n\nI decided not to go and I apologised to my sister and her now husband for not making it.\nMy family and her husband\u2019s family are blowing up my phone for ruining their wedding and not being considerate. \nI\u2019m still mourning my late husband and this isn\u2019t making it any easier. \nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689092499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wvvdn/aita_for_missing_my_sisters_wedding_to_grieve_my/", "score": 2366, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Other guests would have been appalled that you went to a festive event so soon after your husbands death.  They would have gossiped about you, questioning your loyalty and devotion to him.\n2.  At least one butthead would act loudly offended when you refuse to participate in trying to catch the bouquet.\n3.  The rest of the guests would criticize you for having a negative impact on the celebration because you couldn\u2019t hide your sadness.\n4.  Relatives would have asked you, in front of many others, how much life insurance you got.\n5.

How could they expect you to put on a happy face so soon after such a devastating loss?\n\nThey obviously only care about the wedding, so it's up to you to take care of you. You're not \"ruining the wedding\", you're literally picking up the pieces of the life you expected to have.\n\nYour sister's attitude is just the worst - talk about zero compassion. On the bright side, if she keeps up that sort of behavior you'll probably be feeling okay in time to go to her next wedding.", "Wow, your family is full of horrible people. Absolutely NTA!!! I'm so sorry for your loss - you are doing the right thing taking care of yourself. You can go to your sister's next wedding.", "Jesus Christ, NTA! Five days after the loss of a spouse you're supposed to go to a big celebration? If this were my wedding, I'd have postponed it. He's *her* family, too! I would not have been able to dress up and dance around all smiles right after my BIL just DIED at the age of 26!!!

Losing a spouse isn\u2019t just losing a best friend. It\u2019s losing your life partner. It\u2019s losing the life you thought you would have and the kids you thought you would have. You aren\u2019t just grieving the loss of a best friend but of an entire life. I am so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine the pain you are in!!! It is totally understandable that you decided to miss your sister\u2019s wedding. I can\u2019t even begin to process in my head how you would handle that and I\u2019m not in your shoes. There is no way for her to justify your husband\u2019s passing ruined her wedding or you deciding it\u2019s best to not go has ruined her wedding. She is the a hole.", "NTA.

You need to to take the time to grieve the loss you\u2019ve just suffered. \n\nIf you go and get emotional, people come to you to offer condolences, or even just don\u2019t have a HAPPY face, they will be upset because you are taking away from their day.

Her husband passed away a few days before her grandfathers 95th birthday\u2014he was supposed to have like three parties with tons of family and friends invited. (Probably too many for that point in time during the pandemic but I disgress.) Wh\ufffcen news of the passing reached the family, everything was cancelled and we had a small wake instead.\n\n~~I\u2019m not saying your sister necessarily should have postponed her wedding, but it\u2019s legitimately shocking how they\u2019ve treated you since your husband passed~~. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope your friends are giving you the support and empathy your family is clearly incapable of.\n\nEDIT: I've thought about this some more and want to edit my initial comment. It's disgusting that they went ahead with the wedding less than a week after your husband died. I hope you never speak to these people again.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister and you are close, its understandable that she's heartbroken that you've missed a (hopefully) once in a lifetime event for her. But you were in a no win situation. \n\nEither you went and weren't going to be as engaged with the wedding as she would have liked/stolen the spotlight as the young widow being brave attending her sister's wedding or you were going to stay at home and mourn. There was no correct choice here expect for whichever brought you peace in that moment. \n\nTurn your phone off for the time being OP. Mourn the loss of your husband, surround yourself with warmth and caring presences who can make your day to day a little easier and grieve everything you need to in your own time.", "100000% NTA. i\u2019m so sorry for your loss, they\u2019re the ones not being considerate. it\u2019s so awful that people have that mentality, it\u2019s so damaging. this is YOUR mourning period and it\u2019s not just your sisters wedding. what does your sister mean \u201csit around doing nothing\u201d ?? even if you do that, that\u2019s your way of coping. if you went to the wedding and you were spaced out, they would say you\u2019re ruining the wedding, you really can\u2019t win by going or staying home and grieving on your own. selfish people.", "NTA. Lots of assholes in your environment, though. Losing your partner and mourning the loss excuses you from any and all social obligations for a year and a day (with the exception of a visit from your sovereign if you live in a monarchy) or so I was told according to Victorian rules. Your sister is not royalty and her wedding is not a command performance. Take all the time you need to sit with your grief and your memories and if it's not what your family likes, block their numbers until you can bear to deal with them. I am truly sorry for your loss and wish you strength for the future.", "NTA. Two weeks isn't a lot of time to wrap your head around what happened and take care of urgent things when it comes to death. Her wedding wasn't ruined because of you- she and her husband's family ruined it by being AHs.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nGrief trumps everything - even their dream wedding. Noone should be forced to watch someone else's happiness when they are grieving a loved one.", "NTA your family is, they have zero empathy for your loss. I'm surprised they can be this heartless.  Your sister clearly wasnt as close as you think she was.", "NTA.\n\nyour sister is TA if anything. how can she scream at you when you JUST told her you lost your husband? that is beyond cruel. \n\ni'm so sorry for your loss. take the time you need to grieve and don't let her anger effect you.", "NTA\n\nYour grieve is much more importent then the wedding.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you, but a lot with your family.\n\nI wish you all the best.", "NTA.  I give you permission to block them, all of them, until you are ready to accept their apologies.  You don't have to apologize or excuse yourself.  You don't have to forgive them.  You don't have to placate them.  You can just say, \"this is hard enough and you all aren't helping.  I am blocking you all until I can deal your bullshit again.  I will let if you know if that ever happens.\"", "OMG what have I just read?! Of course you are NTA, you have lost your husband, the love of your life for God sake! Not only do you have to deal with the trauma and grief of your sudden loss, you have your family, who should have at least a modicum of compassion, piling on and abusing you - shouting is emotionally abusive behaviour- as if what is happening is nothing. Insensitive parents and entitled sister are the AHs. OMG, although I don't know you, I'm am absolutely raging and appalled at the treatment to which you are being subjected.\n\nYou do what is right for you, don't be bullied into doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable. \n\nLastly OP, I'm so sorry for your loss, and sending you virtual hugs from the UK", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.", "WHAT THE FUCK! Seriously wtf is wrong with your entire family. They are all inconsiderate and insensitive assholes. I would block every last person that was not in support of you during such a tremendous loss.

Your family is heartless.  I'm pretty sure you would cry at their wedding - for obvious reasons; or your friends and family would gather around to comfort you.

I hope your family can take a step back and see the big picture.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, and also sorry that your family are a bunch of inconsiderate assholes that thonk grieving for the recent death of a partner is considered \u201csitting on your ass doing nothing.\u201d That is just fucking callous", "NTA\n\nObviously.\n\nI'm always curious about these scenarios where extended families are \"blowing up my phone\". I can't fathom multiple people harassing a widow b/c of \\*checks notes\\* someone else's wedding.", "NTA.   \nYour family are MASSIVE AHs. You just lost your husband and they expect you to attend a wedding, a celebration, whilst you are deep in mourning? Take time to yourself, forget about them for however long you need to greive and heal. \n\nI honestly cannot fathom how self centred your family must be to expect you to be in any mental shape to go to a wedding so soon.", "NTA. \n\nAnd they will realize eventually that they indeed are the assholes. They\u2019ll rant to someone outside the circle eventually and they\u2019ll say \u201cmy sister missed my wedding because her husband died the same week.\u201d And they\u2019ll get really odd and gross reactions that they won\u2019t like. \n\nYou\u2019re never the asshole for this situation", "NTA \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.

You are NTA.  I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  It's ridiculous to expect you to show up happy to any event less than a week after your husband died.  I mean, even your workplace should have given you a minimum of a week's bereavement.\n\nAlso, you do know that if you had shown up and been less than 100% enthusiastic, they would have claimed that you were either attention seeking or looking to wreck her wedding right?  Based on their reaction to you not going, I could definitely see it going that way anyway.\n\nETA: Did your parents, sister, and sister's fiance come to the funeral activities?  Man, this situation they are putting you in pisses me off the more I think about it.", "Your sister is clearly TA. Everyone greaves differently and your way of grieving this major loss is ok.

The story seems off.", "Yea, that was my secondary, \"strategic\" thought.  At the very least, the sister should (selfishly) *not* want her there simply because its going to put a damper on the day if people are giving the OP condolences and OP is visibly distraught/grieving.", "Worried? I was getting straight mad lol took a deep breath at the /s", "Gross. Get a new family.", "Hey- I can\u2019t control what people do. People are going to lie no matter what.", "Good. It would suck for OP to have to deal with her sister trying to make his funeral all about her.", "Actually yes, depending on denomination many religions do not embalm and funerals are held within 24-48 hours of death. That said most of them also have a morning period that is at least a week, which OP would still be in the middle of. NTA.", "That might be a blessing.  I wouldn\u2019t want them there.", " I am sure you have been planning a funeral you never thought you would be planning so soon!", "Literally. FIL died 10 weeks before our wedding, and we discussed postponing.  We didn't but severely downgraded and left only close family members in the guest list. And that was weeks, not just a few days.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I post phoned our wedding when his brother died 4 weeks prior.", "Slight note: in some cultures you do not postpone weddings for anything. Not even the immediate family of the Bride and Groom dying. \n\nOf course, also in my culture, no one sitting Shivah is expected to be at a wedding. Even within Shloshim it would raise a LOT of eyebrows. So no one would have even the slightest havah mina, of OP being present.", "It'd be one thing to ask if OP was sure or let OP know the invitations still open, offer to zoom/facetime her during the wedding, or even insist someone who would otherwise be attending the wedding (like a parent) sit with OP instead when OP doesn't want the company.\n\nAll of those would be appropriate and well meaning- if in poor taste.\n\nThis was them being deliberately cruel", "Even Connor Roy sent all the guests home.", "Average-bride-on-Reddit comment.", ">Op could've literally had the funeral in the church right before the wedding ffs\n\nShe wouldn't even have to change! Full widow's weeds complete with black veil...", "Sister and family will probably make out that OP tried to take attention away from the wedding by having the funeral so close after. Poor OP", "I can do petty and grief at the same time. If I was OP and this pile on didn\u2019t stop immediately, I\u2019d show up to the wedding in head to toe black, including a veil, and noticeably weep during the vows and any other traditional wedding moment. Make them really regret making my grief part of their happy day.", "right!!! and if OP were to need to leave early/start crying or just not be super excited they\u2019d make it an issue too.", "This blows my mind. Like my former boyfriend who at the time I thought was the real deal love dumped me 3 days before my brother\u2019s wedding. It was devastating and it was incredibly hard for me to to do the happy smile etc for his wedding. I cannot even fathom if my HUSBAND had just died. Just getting out of bed would be an accomplishment.  OP\u2019s family is awful.", "The caliber of that \"sister\", she'd probably would have had no problem with asking OP not to tell people and to make an excuse or something.\n:( Maybe we should stop that weird \"my perfect day\" narrative around weddings, it appears it makes some folks lose their humanity.", "That's why there's the sarcasm label on it.", "Right? OP says she and her sister were close. My sister would forget she had a wedding and would be with me at the hospital as my husband was dying because I needed her. Even if they\u2019re not as close as my sister and I you would think she\u2019d be asking her close sister what she needed in this time.", "That's fair", "It might be a blessing in disguise, but that doesn't stop the ugly feelings of having people you cared about (and thought cared about you) not coming to support you on one of the worst days of your life. \ud83d\ude14 I really hope OP has some good people in her corner.", "My sister wanted me to delay our mom's internment because she was on vacation (her second one in three months). I refused. She missed our sister's husband (also my husband's brother) funeral 2 months before because she was on vacation. She lives in another state and flew in for our BIL's internment but the night before she left our mom passed away. I arranged for a private viewing for her and my brother who both deliberately missed our BIL's internment. If she hadn't missed BIL's funeral I would say fine but really you flew up here for it, actually stayed in our sister's home and then told her she wasn't going, my husband was pissed and so was my sister and her kids. Like WTF!", "Some take ages, though. The last funeral in my family happened nearly a month after death.", "Doesn't even have to relate to religion; a lot depends on where you live. In Ireland, the funeral usually takes place 1-2 days after death. My mother died about 5pm on Christmas Day and was buried on December 27th (we could have gone for 26th but were waiting for some family members to fly there and they couldn't get flights on Boxing Day). And being in Ireland there was of course one hell of a wake!", "/u/IllLengthinesso26 is a bot that copied part of [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wvvdn/aita_for_missing_my_sisters_wedding_to_grieve_my/jrk5hpz/)", "In  my culture  weddings are a huge deal and delaying weddings is considered quite bad  often due to costs involved but also due to various superstitions but the wedding converts to the most basic version possible. Literally no one will expect a grieving widow to attend  and frankly  the close family is expected to mourn for about 40 days and are taken care of by their relatives.  frankly everyone will side eye the family at the wedding for looking happy at any time. OP is NTA and her family is heartless.", "I had a friend who's future father in law pass away the night before their wedding, which I didn't find out till I arrived. They went through with the whole wedding, with her poor MIL being helped down the aisle. It was a very somber ceremony and reception. I think it's likely they felt it was way to late to post pone anything, so guests were informed quietly as they arrived.", "It took us almost two and half weeks to plan my brothers funeral. Between the post mortem and funeral arrangements it takes so much longer then just over a week,", "Connors political advisor was definitely the one behind the scenes pulling strings so Connor REALIZED he should send everyone home.", "I used to work retail, with a company that dealt with a lot of brides. After 9/11 happened, one the brides was in my store, and was complaining and complaining about how people couldn\u2019t fly in and were going to miss her wedding. (It was *that* soon after, that planes still weren\u2019t flying!)\n\nI worked retail for almost 20 years, and I only lost it on a customer a handful of times. This was one of them! After hearing her complain about how it was \u201cruining her wedding\u201d I couldn\u2019t take any more and finally was like, \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry this is so inconvenient for you. Maybe the next time we have a national tragedy where 3,000 people die, they should check to make sure it fits your schedule first!\u201d\n\nI got kind of a blank stare for a minute, and then she thanked me for her things and quickly walked out! I though for sure I\u2019d hear about it later, but I never did!", "Especially if he was cremated. It took me two weeks to get my husband's remains back.", "My sister and I are close.  We have different moms.  I drove 3 hours to go be with her the first weekend after her mom died and drove her around to run errands so that she wouldn't have to be alone and wouldn't be driving in an altered mental state.  JFC this poor woman needs people to rally around her right now, not run her down.", "Lol true", "Maybe you shocked her into understanding.", "it absolutely makes sense.  I thought the same thing.  Imagine being so in love with someone that you can't bear to spend your life without them only to criticize someone who just lost that person!\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, OP!  hugs", "Some people care more about the wedding than they do the person they're standing at the alter with."]}
