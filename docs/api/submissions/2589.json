They were together for 7 years, their relationship was very toxic, like she would hit him toxic and i know this because theres several police reports that he has copies of that he used at court for custody. They broke up 3 years ago and we met a couple months after that, we were friends at first, then we started dating and after a year we got married, he has full custody and she has visitations 1 weekend of the month because shes proven not to be mentally stable, now i sometimes pick up the kids or drop them off in the occasion that he stayed a little over at work, we usually go together but theres been a couple times where I\u2019ve gone by myself but those times were horrible, she would refuse to bring the kids out the car and i had to call local PD, there was a time where she got super aggressive and almost hit me cause the kids ran to hug me. So now instead of going alone i bring either my younger brother (m18) or my husbands sister (f24) just for witness and they usually record incase anything happens. My husband ex called my husbands mom (who doesn\u2019t like me) and said that my brother intimidated her by getting off the car and getting in her face which never happened so she called my husband telling him i was an asshole for this and that i have no business doing that, i didn\u2019t think i was an asshole but shes told several people that story and some are saying that i should imagine how threaten she feels cause there\u2019s two of us and its just her.

She has a history of violence and assault. You are being cautious and careful.  Nothing wrong with that at all.", "NTA - Sounds like you have video evidence to dispute the ex's claims. Not to mention additional police reports from when you have had to call them. So plenty of documentation of why you need someone else there with you to pick up the kids. \n\nBut honestly - if you MIL is siding with your husband's abusive ex, why are either of you in contact with her? If your husband tries to tell you that you have to get the kids on your own from now on, tell him that is his responsibility.", "Um, no. NTA she sounds unhinged. Why are yall not using a mediator type situation to exchange the kids. Or the police station, etc? There has to be a better option than yall going to her house and encountering either violence or threats. Have you reported her behaviors? It doesn't sound safe for her to have even the visitation she does have now.", "NTA and anyone who believes what this woman says (with her history). Anyone who believes her, isn't worth worrying about their opinion. (BTW you did bring your brother to intimidate her into behaving civilly, nothing wrong with intimidation.)", "NTA\n\nYou said the story she is telling didn\u2019t happen. Let the people know she is lying and you record all exchanges.", "NTA - sounds like you need help/backup when you go , I wouldn't go alone either", "Nta but you should definitely talk to your husband about this and tell him what's up. If she was abusive towards him I doubt she'd think twice with you. Matter of personal safety at the very least.", "NTA  but not your circus, not your monkeys. There is no reason for your bf to be depending on you to get the kids, especially with his ex's history. If you weren't in the picture bet he'd figure it out. Tell him you're sorry but he's got to come up with a better solution", "Obviously NTA but perhaps get your brother to stay in the car unless needed\n\nI really feel for the kids here", "NTA\n\nYou've gone alone in the past and it's been horrible.   Taking a safety person sounds like a good solution.", "NTA this lady is insane and your husband needs to go back to court for supervised visits. This isn't good for the kids.", "NTA. If your MIL feels this way, perhaps she should do the picks ups and drop offs with the kids. You aren\u2019t obligated to put yourself in unsafe situations to appease other people.", "NTA\n\nYou do everything you can to make sure you're safe and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Her telling on you is about making her appear like a victim and maybe to cause a rift in the relationship between you and the people around you. Keep recording your interactions so you have proof that there was no wrongdoing on your part - you never know when you might need it privately or in court.", "NTA. You are proyecting yourself and the kids on this situation. When you go, dont go alone, and Tell the perso Who go with you to record. \nDont listen the people Who said its your fault. She is inestable, and dangerous.", "I would not want to be alone around her either. Who knows what her next stunt will be? A friend used to use me as her witness and it was stressful sometimes. (And her husband's ex wasn't full tilt ridiculous like your husband's ex seems to be, She just sometimes would be testy and belligerent.) \n\nNTA. No one signs up for this stuff. He can't expect you to just jump in the deep end with this  woman?", "Info: if it's only once a month, why can't your husband request that time off? Or could his mom bring the children to your house?\n\nIf it was a situation involving a normal person I would say YTA for not wanting to pick up or drop off, but this seems like it could be dangerous for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At the point that it becomes normalized and stable, that would be different. I definitely agree with recording every instance. She sounds horrible and like someone who won't let reality or the truth get in the way of their agenda.", "Nope NTA .\n\nBut try to leave them in the car and try to let your husband pick them up most of the time.\nIf its once a month he should be able fit that in he's schedule", "NTA    you said you record things, show MIL the recording,  it proves the ex is lying.", "NTA and continue to have them record the drop offs so there is proof so she doesn't try to use this lie she's already spewing off to MIL, in court or with police she sounds unhinged enough to attempt that.", "NTA. Tell mil thank you for volunteering to do the pick up/drop off from now until the kids are 18.", "NTA\n\nIf y'all still have to do a kid drop-off/pick up, time to switch to the parking lot of the nearest police station.", "INFO:\n\nWhy does your husband want you to pick up the kids alone? \n\nWhy aren\u2019t transfers being done in a third party location like a the parking lot of a police station? \n\n**There are a lot of red flags here, and they\u2019re all point to your husband.** \n\nHe\u2019s intentionally putting you in an unsafe and uncomfortable situation. Why? He\u2019s dumping his parental responsibilities on you and ignoring your concerns. Why? Either he doesn\u2019t believe you or he doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not sure which one is worse.", "NTA but see if you can change the exchange location to a police station. A coworker told me she ended having to due that due to the same thing. Get a dash cam so you can also have proof of her reactions", "Esh. Meet at police station or other safe public place. Problem solved", "We don\u2019t go to her house we meet in a half way point cause she lives 2 hours from us. We are talking to a lawyer to see if it would be best for her to not see the kids at all with her state of mind or for us to meet at the police station because the courts decided on the drop off/pick up location.", "Yes i brought my brother so she can see that im not alone but he has never stepped up to her or any of the sorts, he usually gets off and stands by his door so when he records the conversation can be heard clearly. It\u2019s ridiculous to me how she can make up all this things that never happened.", "He has a vey demanding job the only day he can\u2019t get off its Friday which is the day we drop off the kids to her, he always has Sundays off so theres never an issue there. MIL said she can\u2019t due to \u201c work \u201c she just doesn\u2019t want to help but likes butting in.", "The court set up the drop off/pickup location. We legally can\u2019t change the place. So were talking to our lawyer to see what our next steps are.", "Ah I see. I read it wrong thinking she wasn't bringing the kids out of the house to the car. I see now. Ugh horrible situation yall are in. It's wild with her history and how she behaves the court thought even a weekend a month would be safe for the kids", "You said your brother records it. Just send her the recording, problem solved.\n\nThen tell your husband that moving forward, he is picking up his own kids. You aren\u2019t dealing with his crazy ex or crazy MIL, especially until your MIL is put in her place and gives you a proper apology.\n\nLike why continue putting yourself at risk. Also with everything that has gone on, your husband is an AH for not hiring a lawyer for full custody, but what do I know."]}
