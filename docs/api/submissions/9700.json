My immigrant parents never forced me to wear salwar khameez at home. It was instead something we\u2019d get as special gifts - some casual, some fancy.

And that means you need to keep them involved in the parts they are going to enjoy: stories, myths, holidays, etc. Whenever there's good or fascinating news from India, read it out around the table. Get heavily involved in the fun parts of holidays from your country, even the obscure ones. Read aloud as a family sometimes, and choose literature from India. \n\nBut don't force your kids to wear things they hate in order to make them feel connected.

But in their quest to expose their kids to Indian culture, I feel like many of them don\u2019t think about whether they will lose their children themselves. \n\nYour approach is also not rational.  Kids in India are completely not wearing desi clothes all the time at home (which is another quandary of the immigrant experience - they oftentimes hold the India of the time of their departure in their minds, and while that home country moves on and changes, the expats do not).  My nephews and nieces that are your kids\u2019 age that live in India- NONE of them wear Indian clothes at home.  It\u2019s all joggers and T-shirts.  I myself tend to be in jeans when I am in India because I feel like if the kids who grew up there are wearing them day in and day out, why not me?\n\nI think you are also putting too much of an emphasis on this clothes thing, and quite frankly, approaching this in the wrong way.  I grew up my entire life in the States and I never wear Indian clothes at home, yet I am super into my culture (visited every year as we grew up, close to all my family, speak 3 languages, took classical Indian dance and music lessons).  And while I limit my Indian wear to functions (poojas, weddings etc) I am actually very much into Indian fashion - shopping online and in India is one of my favourite things to do and I always look forward to functions where I can wear them.  But even though I don\u2019t wear them regularly, nobody would ever say I am not attached to my culture because I wear sweatpants at home. Plus, so many other things keep your kids far more closer to Indian culture than clothes - language (for instance, primarily speaking your native language at home makes a lot of sense to me), food, arts.  The last thing I would actually expect is clothes, especially if they do wear them for functions. \n\nAlso, because you mentioned guests coming all the time - if you are doing this to show your relatives from India just how Indian your kids are, it\u2019s a thousand times YTA.  You\u2019re forcing your kids to do something they hate (at home, of all places, which should be their safe space) to impress people they see once a year.  And people who are used to seeing teenagers wearing western clothes at home back in India.  My parents also, in many ways, bragged about how Indian their kids were, and it really made me resent them for it.  And in many ways, it totally backfired. \n\nYou brought your children to the UK. You seem to begrudge them their westernness.  But your kids ARE British.  Asian British maybe, but thinking that they are primarily Asian when their everyday lives are British is unfair.  My parents had this attitude in many ways, and it was not a smart view to have, in my opinion. And fundamentally unfair.", "YTA. Let them wear what they want.

Forcing me to do something I don't want to do, but you want me to do for a subjective reason will build up resentment in me towards that reason, and anyone else that attempts to force me to follow something that forces me to act in a way I'm greatly uncomfortable with. \n\n\nWearing cultural clothing at home helps you feel closer to your culture. It clearly isn't helping you're children feel that way, and it's instead causing them to resent aspects that you dean your culture. \n\nHomes are where we sleep.

If you want them to value and stay connected to their Indian heritage, speak to them in your language and make sure they are at least fluent enough to talk with non-English-speaking relatives. Make sure they understand how to use the clothing, and which clothing is appropriate for what occasions. \n\nI think it\u2019s fine to insist that appropriate cultural clothing be worn at cultural events and family gatherings, to be respectful.

Bad move, major asshole.", "Yta\n\n\n\nYour children are individuals. They are NOT your property. It IS sexist to force any woman to dress in ANY WAY.

And her relationship with her brothers is only going to deteriorate, as they are now effectively just an extension of your oppressive rules.\n\nThe home is supposed to be the one place a person can relax, dress comfortably how they want, etc. But you've taken that away. Don't plan on having a good relationship with your daughter as an adult unless you change your ways. I once dated a girl just like your daughter. Her parents were 1st generation Indian immigrants. They pushed Indian culture on her too hard. When she got older, she rebelled and went against everything her parents wanted. She completely turned her back on anything traditionally Indian. She would even be intentionally rude if she encountered another Indian person who wore traditional clothing. Needless to say, her relationship with her parents is beyond strained. This can get ugly if you continue.\n\nIf your goal is to see your culture be practiced by future generations of your family, you are going about it wrong. Immigrant families assimilate into the culture they moved into. It's just a matter of if it's the 1st gen, 2nd gen, or 3rd. If you expose her to your culture in a positive and healthy way, there is a better chance she will respect it and take part in it on certain occasions like many other cultural groups do.

Even it won't end up in their being just English, they will probably want to align more with those values than the heritage.\n\nAnd choosing to go to a place where your family can give you a better life does not mean that you should just forget about your heritage and it definitely does not mean that they will fully fit in and have English values. One should celebrate both sets of values. But this is not the way to do it, especially not with older kids who should already know what they want, even for younger kids, fun cultural activities are going to connect them more than having to wear specific clothes, especially as it looks like they are not even being given a choice of what type of Indian clothes to wear because surprise surprise, there are many different types.", "So sarees??

Infant and maternal mortality in the US is impacted by race. You are more likely to die if you're a black woman because of the racism embedded in our medical system. That's also awful. But just like in India, there are people actively working to stop these things. Making blanket statements about culture diminishes the conversations we need to have and how we can uplift each other during these struggles. \n\n(Also, the US has foreign aid conditional on not providing abortions abroad, which is it's own deeply impactful policy that hurts women, but that's a whole other kettle of fish).", "Yeah and let's not forget that it is a normal teenage thing to want to wear clothes your parents don't like when you're a teen.
