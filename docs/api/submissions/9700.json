Get heavily involved in the fun parts of holidays from your country, even the obscure ones. Read aloud as a family sometimes, and choose literature from India. \n\nBut don't force your kids to wear things they hate in order to make them feel connected.

At MOST, make a rule that you want them to INCORPORATE a single traditional item into their outfits. Not 100% one way or the other. And give them the option to wear MEN'S traditional clothing so they at least have the choice of 'culturally appropriate' pants. I'm fairly ignorant of Indian customs, but I've heard gold jewelry is a big thing in your culture. So maybe get them a nice set of bracelet/necklace/earrings and ask them to wear at least 1 item around the house. You could ask them to help you pick them out, find something that would nicely complement even western outfits, something they really like. You might even catch them wearing them *outside* the house if they like them enough!  \n\n\nBecause isn't that what you want? For them to LIKE their cultural heritage? For them to show it off and be proud? If you keep forcing it on them, it'll just be a form of oppression, and they will cast it aside the second they are able. Give them OPTIONS, give them FREEDOM, and they'll be much more likely to be receptive.", "I think I can understand your point, I'm Mexican and very proud, I imagine that if I had kids in another country, I would want them to love and be proud of being Mexican, and do Mexican tradition.\n\nBut I think the problem is that you make them do stuff, when someone enforce you something you don't get to like and even repel that. \n\nI would speak to them , to try to explain the importance that is for me traditions, and try to speak of the history and why stuff is like that, but they need they identity, let them be how they feel more comfortable in their home. \n\nSo I will not say you are the total A , but kind of, but only because you don't how to transmit that importance to your family.\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd1e", "YTA.

My parents used to do certain traditional activities and call us to join them and then they would tell us stories about their childhood, traditions, our history. It was wonderful. I have the most amazing memories connected to my heritage now. Try something like that. This dressing up rule is honestly absolutely pointless and achieves nothing", "YTA.  You could have let your daughter embrace your culture on her own terms, which would have meant her getting more out of it.

What terrible parents.", "YTA - Yes your children are of Indian heritage but from the sounds of it they were born and raised in UK. They are British and only Indian by heritage. Girls don't often wear dresses in the UK and for good reason. Your girls are not Indian, they have Indian heritage there is a BIG difference. Also Indian is HOT the UK at the best of times is luke warm. \n\nKeeping your heritage does not have to affect how your girls have independence and unique personalities. They are western girls and will have a very different out look on their heritage, they may even see it as very sexist and controlling. \n\nI don't know much about Indian heritage (love to learn more though) but a lot of religious and cultural backgrounds can be sexist and male dominated. \n\nMany people who move from middle easten countries try and keep their heritage and it can cause families to fall apart. \n\nSpecial events: totally should be Indian dress even more so if its a cultural event or Indian wedding (I don't know other events you may have) but everyday clothes should be free choice regardless of home, heritage and history.", "This.

I had a friend and her parents forced her to wear \u201cher culture\u201d. As an adult she does not like to wear anything that even reminds her of her culture. Also had another friend from the same culture. Her parents didn\u2019t really care for the clothing so she could wear whatever she wanted. They taught her the things they wanted her to know from her culture. As an adult she now feels rich to know multiple cultures and sometimes wears clothing from her culture.

The culture there isn't that amazingly different than in Europe, when it comes to clothes.  You're not trying to connect to Indian culture, you're trying to connect to a traditional mind set that went away long ago.  Don't try to claim this is about culture, it's about classism and sexism and things that many Indians are trying to leave behind.

There are a ton of loungewear brands in India that specialize in making clothing for people to wear at home.", "Indian traditional clothes are very beautiful and I'm pretty sure that if she let the girls choose their clothes they will eventually realize that too. Even if they don't there are million of other ways to stay connected to the culture. I'm pretty sure there are tons of movies to watch, Indian songs to sing, stories to tell, maybe there's even some Indian club in England they can join. They can learn to cook Indian dishes, visit India when possible, talk to relatives that live there, read books from Indian authors, etc. Why stick with one thing that the girls obviously hate?
