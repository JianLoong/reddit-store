Get heavily involved in the fun parts of holidays from your country, even the obscure ones. Read aloud as a family sometimes, and choose literature from India. \n\nBut don't force your kids to wear things they hate in order to make them feel connected.

But in their quest to expose their kids to Indian culture, I feel like many of them don\u2019t think about whether they will lose their children themselves. \n\nYour approach is also not rational.  Kids in India are completely not wearing desi clothes all the time at home (which is another quandary of the immigrant experience - they oftentimes hold the India of the time of their departure in their minds, and while that home country moves on and changes, the expats do not).  My nephews and nieces that are your kids\u2019 age that live in India- NONE of them wear Indian clothes at home.  It\u2019s all joggers and T-shirts.  I myself tend to be in jeans when I am in India because I feel like if the kids who grew up there are wearing them day in and day out, why not me?\n\nI think you are also putting too much of an emphasis on this clothes thing, and quite frankly, approaching this in the wrong way.  I grew up my entire life in the States and I never wear Indian clothes at home, yet I am super into my culture (visited every year as we grew up, close to all my family, speak 3 languages, took classical Indian dance and music lessons).  And while I limit my Indian wear to functions (poojas, weddings etc) I am actually very much into Indian fashion - shopping online and in India is one of my favourite things to do and I always look forward to functions where I can wear them.  But even though I don\u2019t wear them regularly, nobody would ever say I am not attached to my culture because I wear sweatpants at home. Plus, so many other things keep your kids far more closer to Indian culture than clothes - language (for instance, primarily speaking your native language at home makes a lot of sense to me), food, arts.  The last thing I would actually expect is clothes, especially if they do wear them for functions. \n\nAlso, because you mentioned guests coming all the time - if you are doing this to show your relatives from India just how Indian your kids are, it\u2019s a thousand times YTA.  You\u2019re forcing your kids to do something they hate (at home, of all places, which should be their safe space) to impress people they see once a year.  And people who are used to seeing teenagers wearing western clothes at home back in India.  My parents also, in many ways, bragged about how Indian their kids were, and it really made me resent them for it.  And in many ways, it totally backfired. \n\nYou brought your children to the UK. You seem to begrudge them their westernness.  But your kids ARE British.  Asian British maybe, but thinking that they are primarily Asian when their everyday lives are British is unfair.  My parents had this attitude in many ways, and it was not a smart view to have, in my opinion. And fundamentally unfair.", "YTA. Let them wear what they want.

Forcing me to do something I don't want to do, but you want me to do for a subjective reason will build up resentment in me towards that reason, and anyone else that attempts to force me to follow something that forces me to act in a way I'm greatly uncomfortable with. \n\n\nWearing cultural clothing at home helps you feel closer to your culture. It clearly isn't helping you're children feel that way, and it's instead causing them to resent aspects that you dean your culture. \n\nHomes are where we sleep.

At 17, that's a terrifying situation that most teens could not handle-- being alone, no family supporting them whatsoever. Such a tragic situation for so many young girls.\n\nEdit:  YTA OP. You knew that in western culture, women wear whatever they want and they are not universally treated as less-than entities to be controlled by men. Plus, as other posters pointed out, women do wear pants in India. I had two friends who wore them in Canada and when they went to visit relatives in India.", "Or doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is trying to force the kids to give up their cultural heritage, more that the parents are trying to force them to partake in it when they don\u2019t want to. OP said that moved to London after they got married so more than likely all 3 kids were born there and are British. No one is saying the parents can\u2019t continue to follow their cultural beliefs but why should the kids, one of whom is basically an adult, be forced to?", "OP did say they\u2019re \u201cBritish citizens\u201d. Just a correction.", "Wasn\u2019t forcing anyone to give up anything- I am saying and stand by the verifiable fact that the sons and daughters of immigrants are no longer the same culture as their parents or ancestors. It\u2019s not a matter of anyone consciously or unconsciously being forced to do anything- it\u2019s simply a natural function of being a part of the culture in which one is reared. \n\nFrankly I find your \u2018xenophobic \u2019 comment laughable on one level- not only does it not matter whether it\u2019s \u2018technically\u2019 true or not- the fact is that these parents and children are not culturally the same because they were not reared in the same culture. On another level I find your xenophobia comment deeply offensive because of its inherent racial essentialism- what I am hearing is that folks of  South Asian, Caribbean and other non-white descent will never be \u201ctruly English\u201d in your eyes which is both inaccurate and DEEPLY offensive. I shouldn\u2019t have to mention the fact that national identity and phenotype are NOT the same and equivocating them is racist.", "OP literally says they're English citizens. What are you even talking about. Their kids were born in England. They're British of Indian descent not Indian. And it's also not about erasing heritage, it's about forcing heritage. Did you even read the post or were you too pumped to show how clueless you are and just decided to write this nonsense without any of the context explicitly stated in OPs post?", "I don't live in the UK and I have never been there so I have no clue how many Indians are there. I live in another European country and there are some Indians here but not enough to make the maintaining easy. So yeah my bad \ud83d\ude02", "Are you a bot or responding to the wrong person or missing something?", "I think this is the mom, she says \"my husband and I\".", "She might even claim to like sugar! Gasp! What would make a kid say something like that?!", "Yeah the wording jumped to me as well, OP is so dismissive and patronizing, they're pretty much raising the girls to go NC asap", "Idk how u can say that... they arnt forced to wear anything when they leave the house....", "Oh, I didn't think you were saying it was a good thing.  \n\nOP's internalized misogyny isn't helping anyone, not even her son, who, if she's all about a culture that requires girls (women) to wear dresses, is  more important to her than her daughters.   \n\nMost of the comments are about how shitty she is being to her daughters, but maybe if it's also pointed out to her that she's being shitty to her son as well,  it might make more of an impression.  \n\nAnd, yes, it's also fucked up that that I even felt the need to point that out.", "I had a friend who got sent back and married off because she got a part time job in a taco bell. I know a guy who's mom used to keep a notebook and would write down how many times the kids were 'disrespectful' and would take them back to Jamaica once every 2 years to punish them 'properly'.", "Nah you don\u2019t lose your culture or identity because you are British. They are *also* British. They are British, and of Indian origin. Culturally they are allowed and should be both. \n\nTo say they have more in common with their classmates then with their cousins is a big assumption. There are many many (read literally hundreds of millions) of Indians that have a very similar culture in many ways to the west. They are very \u201c\u2018modern\u201d.", "So what is it actually doing for them while in the house? Do you think they are gleefully absorbing culture through their clothing? Do you think they will be happy to be cultured in this way? No, they will rebel as they are and infight as they are and all will be lost in the end. OP ITA", "It really is. But you\u2019re probably correct.", "Who said that though? I didn\u2019t say anything about India and it\u2019s modernity? What I said, and stand by, is that these kids aren\u2019t Indian because they were literally raised in the UK. Certainly they have a South Asian background but they aren\u2019t from there and they are not Indian.\n\nAnd while sure folks can and do find their way to the intersections of whatever their cultural exposures they have it\u2019s illogical  to deny the impact of the culture in which you are reared. It is naive at best and willfully ignorant at worst. We are indeed the products of the culture in which we grow up, even if our home lives are not culturally the same as the larger culture.\n\nUnless you\u2019re one of those who thinks that phenotype dictates culture. Which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not. Because that would be very very very racist."]}
