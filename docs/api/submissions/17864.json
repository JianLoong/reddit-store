You acknowledged her respectfully and lovingly to have a photo, she rejected you bc she got caught in her own feelings.", "NTA and you are not a brat.\n\nNicole is your stepmother. That doesn't mean you don't care about her, but as you very thoughtfully stated you have a mom. So calling her mom would be insulting to your mother.\n\n\nIf it comes up again ask Nicole/your dad what she wants to be called. If it's \"mom\" then no but if it's something different you could consider it- but you have zero obligation to call her anything but her name. It should be about how YOU feel not Nicole. Sorry sweetie you have to deal with this!", "NTA Is your mom remarried? If so, (or even if not, you could present it as hypothetical) ask your dad how he would feel if he introduced your step-dad as your dad? Nicole is your step-mom and nothing more. It's certainly not your fault you're in this situation and you are definitely not a brat.", "NTA\n\nShe's your stepmom and you called her that.

NTA. \n\nNo, this isn\u2019t on you, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nIt sounds like your dad and stepmom have a few things they need to work out, and if your dad keeps being so dismissive of your feelings, you are absolutely right to be upset with him. It might not be a bad idea to try to talk to them about how you feel if you want to do that, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re still a teenager.

You should have a talk with your dad and Nicole when you go back to their house. Tell them what you told us\u2014 that you love her but do not feel comfortable referring to her as your mom because you already have a mom.

The feelings of the adults around you is not your responsibility. \n\nNichole should talk to you directly if she was offended. She is your stepmom and that is the reality.

It is obviously hard for her. \n\nYour dad is the issue here, getting between you two and taking her side.

She and your dad need to grow up.", "NTA - with that said maybe come up with a mutually agreed upon phrase of endearment for Nicole?

I'd be telling him that if this happens again, Nicole isn't invited.", "NTA \n\nIt is completely unfair that your father would ask you to manage your stepmother's feelings in this scenario. You  had no say about whether Nicole entered your life, and now you're responsible for making sure she feels happy about it? I think not.

It's up to you. Nit to her, nit to your dad, not even to your mom. Only you can decide what you wanna call her and that should depend on what you feel.\n\nsecond: she doesn't like the term stepmom because of the bad image it has. If thats the case I would recommend to find something that is good for both if you. I called my (not even real step) dad my bonus dad for a long time. (Until my bio dad abandoned me for being trans, since then my bonus dad is just my dad).

Your dad reacted poorly. That's not your mom's, Nicole's, or your fault. I'm guessing Nicole has no children and thinks of you as her child (even though she logically knows that your mom is alive, loved, and in your life), that's probably why she was upset.

At 16 you should be able to pick where you live for what percentage of the time.  Currently it is 50/50.  You may want to check into going more time with your mom.

Shopping for prom/formal dresses, graduation, college, wedding, you having children.

Nothing for her to get upset about", "NTA I've been in a similar situation when I was younger and calling your stepmom \"mom\" just doesn't work for some kids and stepmothers need to figure that out. \n\nSince you seem to have a good relationship with her overall, maybe you should try having a direct conversation so you can show that you don't think of her as second class or anything, it's just that you don't feel comfortable with her being called your mom when you have another person in your life who goes by that. Basically have one of those \"I love you equally just in different ways\" convos and hopefully she'll understand.", "NTA at all. She is your Stepmom. Your Dad is out-of line.

Nicole got upset, BUT your mom was also at the track meet? What the hell are you supposed to call her. Someone need to grow up, and it ain't you. This is a Nicole and your dad problem.", "NTA. I\u2019m both a stepmother and a stepchild, and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I adore my stepmom, and she\u2019s one of my favorite people. My mom also passed away many years ago, but I still call my stepmom by her name. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s hard being a stepparent, and I understand to some extent why her feelings were hurt.

That could be an option if you are comfortable with it, of course.", "NTA adults surprisingly do not always think of anything more than their own feelings, or the feelings of their partner, even when dealing with their own children.  When this happens the child often steps up to be the adult.  I did this when my stepfather wanted to adopt me.  I explained that I understood why he wanted to do that, but I was unwilling to hurt my own father by accepting.  You are compassionately maintaining a loving and respectful relationship with two women and have established a reasonable and firm boundary.  You're doing everything right, and I'm sorry your dad abdicated his adulthood, even if it is temporary.  You shouldn't have to fight to do the right thing, and you are doing the right thing.  Not to tell you what your relationships are, but I refer to all of my parents as \"parents\".  Also, when specifying roles, stepfather, father stepmother and mother.  Maybe it would help if you assured your dad, and Nicole, that you do see her as a parent.  A step is still a parent.", "NTA at all. When I was 15 or 16 I had my stepmom ask me point blank to call her my mom instead of my stepmom. My parents divorced when I was 3 and she married my dad when I was 9, but they were together for years before that, basically as long as I can remember. She told me that the word \u201cstepmom\u201d mad her feel like a \u201c2nd class citizen.\u201d It was awkward as hell but I said no. Her feeling that way wasn\u2019t my problem in the slightest. She was my stepmom and that\u2019s how I viewed her. Sounds like your stepmom is feeling something similar. Her feelings are not your problem and not your responsibility to placate or deal with. She needs to come to terms with the fact that she is in fact your step mother and that\u2019s what she\u2019ll always be. I still don\u2019t view my stepmom as a mother figure in any capacity, and it\u2019s not my responsibility to help her come to terms with that. The same goes for you, don\u2019t let anyone guilt or manipulate you into thinking otherwise.", "NTA \n\nIt's not like your mom is out of the picture (not that it would be appropriate to ask even if she were), it's 50/50 custody. And it's not like you've shunned Nicole based on what you said here. I can't imagine why she would think that, at an event your mom is physically attending, that stepmom gets treated as more than as a stepmom. Has she shown jealousy towards your mom before? Especially in your relationship with your mom vs her?\n\nRegardless, it doesn't matter how involved or not your biological parents are, when it comes to step parents, it should ALWAYS be up to the child how comfortable they are with considering step parents to be the parents. To what extent. It should NEVER be anything imposed or forced on them as the children are not the ones that chose to be related to this person. A step parent HAS to understand that their role is NOT to replace another parent, but to support the child in the best way they can and to not expect any return. If at any point the child does choose to call the step parent \"mom\" or \"dad\" that is up to the child to decide when (if they ever are at all) they are comfortable enough to do so. Nobody else.", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand what exactly your dad expects from you. She *is* your stepmom and somehow you care about. Her inability to accept the role of stepmom is her issue to deal with, and hers alone. If you really didn\u2019t care about her she would just be your dad\u2019s wife.", "NTA. She is not your mother. You have a mom. You do not have to replace her just because your dad's wife it jealous.
