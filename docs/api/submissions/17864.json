It's always been 50/50 custody. \n\nWhen I was 8 my dad started dating \u201cNicole\u201d (f40). They got married when I was 12. Nicole has always been kind to me, but I of course have a mom Nicole is just a bonus motherly type figure. I've never called her mom and never will she's just Nicole. \n\nYesterday was my state track meet. My mom, dad, and Nicole drove several hours to watch me race. My dad is very involved in my running career so At the meet he was right there to talk to me after my race. A few people were congratulating me (got 1st in 2 of my races \ud83c\udf89) and asked if my dad and Nicole were my parents I said this is my dad and stepmom. \n\nThen we were taking pictures with coaches, teammates, as well as my parents. It's just a thing you do especially after/ during big meets like State. Everyone is taking pictures it's a thing. I asked a teammate if she could take one of just my mom and me. I noticed Nicole looked kinda upset so I asked Nicole if she wanted to take a picture of just the two of us and started asking my teammate if she would take a picture of my stepmom and me but Nicole declined. Well a few hours later when I got home to my mom\u2019s I got a call from my dad he was telling me how it upsets Nicole I only refer to her as my stepmom. I told him that she is my stepmom and he said I could put in more of an effort to treat her like something more than a stepmom. I do love Nicole but she's not my mom. And I told my dad that and he got mad calling me a brat.

You even tried to make her feel included by asking if she wanted a picture too. Your dad's reaction was wrong. I can understand your step mom being hurt but honestly what else should you call her", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re doing everything right.   \n\n\nImagine asking your dad to treat your mom, more like a wife and less like an ex wife??? It\u2019s kinda along those lines for his conversation with you.   \n\n\nNicole is a stepmom, that\u2019s all. If she\u2019s waiting for something else, it\u2019s not happening.   \n\n\nCongrats on your meet!", "NTA what the heck are you supposed to call her? That\u2019s what she is. You are not obligated to actually call her your mom. Your dad is WAY out of line to call you a brat and owes you an apology. Nicole needs to relax and understand it is unfair to expect you to think she is anything other than your step mom or bonus mom . You acknowledged her respectfully and lovingly to have a photo, she rejected you bc she got caught in her own feelings.", "NTA and you are not a brat.\n\nNicole is your stepmother. That doesn't mean you don't care about her, but as you very thoughtfully stated you have a mom. So calling her mom would be insulting to your mother.\n\n\nIf it comes up again ask Nicole/your dad what she wants to be called. If it's \"mom\" then no but if it's something different you could consider it- but you have zero obligation to call her anything but her name. It should be about how YOU feel not Nicole. Sorry sweetie you have to deal with this!", "NTA Is your mom remarried? If so, (or even if not, you could present it as hypothetical) ask your dad how he would feel if he introduced your step-dad as your dad? Nicole is your step-mom and nothing more. It's certainly not your fault you're in this situation and you are definitely not a brat.", "NTA\n\nShe's your stepmom and you called her that. Her weird hangups about that are her problem, not yours.", "NTA because no one can force you to accept her as your mother when you already have a mom.", "NTA. Nicole *is* and always will be your stepmom. That doesn't change based on feelings. You're not a brat.", "Oh jeez. NTA. \n\nNo, this isn\u2019t on you, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \nIt sounds like your dad and stepmom have a few things they need to work out, and if your dad keeps being so dismissive of your feelings, you are absolutely right to be upset with him. It might not be a bad idea to try to talk to them about how you feel if you want to do that, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re still a teenager. It\u2019s not your job to fix the feelings and issues of the adults in your life.\n\nETA: Congrats on crushing those races!! \ud83c\udf89", "NTA.\n\nShe is your stepmother. Calling her such is not in any way insulting or bad behaviour.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You even tried to include her by offering to take photos with her, same as you did your mom.\n\nWith all due respect, what else does she and your father expect? To just pretend that your mother doesn't exist?\n\nThey are adults and should be setting a better example than this.", "NTA. When your actual mother is right there at the event, your father wants you to call your stepmom \"mom\" when you never do in any other context? That's ridiculous and seems like he was trying to hurt your mother, not just looking out for your stepmom's feelings. \n\nYou have a mom, that label is already taken. You get along with Nicole - tell her you appreciate her, but you won't be calling two people \"mom.\"", "NTA. Your mother was there also. Differentiating between the two of them was respectful to your mother and any of your teammates who don't know there are multiple parental figures in your life.", "NTA. You said it yourself. You have a mom. That mom is not Nicole. Nicole is your stepmother. Your dad needs to wake up.", "If shes like this at a state meeting....what she going to like when ...if...you get married...not the asshole...she's butt hurt ...you aren't responsible for others feelings ...sorry not sorry", "NTA. You should have a talk with your dad and Nicole when you go back to their house. Tell them what you told us\u2014 that you love her but do not feel comfortable referring to her as your mom because you already have a mom. Reassure Nicole that you calling her what she is, your stepmom, does not mean that you don\u2019t value her role in your family.", "NTA \n\nWhat more does he want her to be?? She IS your step mother. There\u2019s a huge range of involvement with that title, but you\u2019re including her plenty", "NTA.  Your mother was literally there of course you wanted a picture.  And you saw Nicole looked out put and OFFERED to take another one with her.  Which means you are kind and generous to her.    \n\n\nHas Nicole done things like this before?", "NTA. \n\nHow would your mom feel about you calling Nichole your mom? The feelings of the adults around you is not your responsibility. \n\nNichole should talk to you directly if she was offended. She is your stepmom and that is the reality. She knew feelings like this could come up when she started dating a man with a daughter.\n\nAt the track meet she was probably jealous of you and your mom\u2019s relationship, and that is just not her place. It is obviously hard for her. \n\nYour dad is the issue here, getting between you two and taking her side. He should be coming to you to understand how to improve your relationship with Nichole (if she asked him to) and Nichole should understand that you\u2019re a teenage girl with divorced parents.", "NTA\n\nYour dads reaction sucked; for that level of reaction is this a repeat issue?\n\nI wonder if Nicole declined the picture because your non verbal queues indicated you didn\u2019t really want to do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My step kids call me bonus mom when talking about me but my name when talking to me directly. Works for us.", "NTA. It's a Nicole problem. She's your stepmom. Your mom is alive and right there. What are you supposed to do about her feelings, whatever they  may be, since no one tells you clearly what they want from you? She and your dad need to grow up.", "NTA - with that said maybe come up with a mutually agreed upon phrase of endearment for Nicole? She's not a mom but shes clearly more important to you than \"hey lady.\"  I have no experience with this but it sounds like she wants a loving title.", "Wow, OP, I\u2019m so sorry your father is being so unfair and unreasonable. Whatever Nicole\u2019s issue is, it is NOT your problem. You have done nothing wrong. NTA.", "NTA - they both need to know that Nicole will always be a stepmom to you. Would they be acting like this if you hadn't done so well at the meet? Does your dad try to take credit for your success? I'd be telling him that if this happens again, Nicole isn't invited.", "NTA \n\nIt is completely unfair that your father would ask you to manage your stepmother's feelings in this scenario. You  had no say about whether Nicole entered your life, and now you're responsible for making sure she feels happy about it? I think not. It's great that you have a good relationship with her, and it already seems like you're making an effort (asking her to join you in a pic, for example). But they don't get to tell you how you're supposed to feel about her.", "NTA - so there are twi possibilities, first, she wants to be your mom equal to your actual mom, that isn't her right. It's up to you. Nit to her, nit to your dad, not even to your mom. Only you can decide what you wanna call her and that should depend on what you feel.\n\nsecond: she doesn't like the term stepmom because of the bad image it has. If thats the case I would recommend to find something that is good for both if you. I called my (not even real step) dad my bonus dad for a long time. (Until my bio dad abandoned me for being trans, since then my bonus dad is just my dad). Because that sounded better in our language.\n\nEither way, you're no ah and they should be more friendly about it. Calling you a brat and shouting makes your dad totally TA.", "How did your dad suggest you refer to her since you already have a mom so that title has been taken? AND your mom was present.\n\nLet's see:\n\n\\- You can call her just Nicole.\n\n\\- You can call her \"my dad's second wife\".\n\n\\- You can call her \"one of my roommate's\"\n\n\\- You can call her \"the woman who replaced my mom at my dad's\"\n\nFact is: she is you stepmom.\n\n*\"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\"*\n\nNTA but your dad is, calling you a brat while you're just being correct.", "NTA.  She is the stepmother.  Fact.  Not sure what else she thinks she would be.", "NTA. I'm 50 years old. I have had a stepmom for 41 of them. Never called her by anything other than her name. You're doing just fine. Congratulations on your races well done.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to refer to her as your step-mom. It doesn\u2019t take away her motherly title, but she should realize your mom is still in your life and she\u2019s not filling the role. It\u2019s one thing if your mom wasn\u2019t in your life, maybe. But it\u2019s 50/50, your mom is still very much so there.\n\nNot to mention, you still treat Nicole like she\u2019s a mother, and even include and care for her. You\u2019re not discarding her from your life.", "Like I definitely appreciate care and even love Nicole and try to include her in things but my mom is my mom and we've always had a close relationship which I don't think I could replicate with Nicole", "Your dad can't force you to feel like she's your mom. It sounds as though you have a good relationship. That's enough to be happy about. NTA.", "Thank you...
