We had a few classes together but weren't close so I didn't rlly think of it. my friends and I weren't the nicest to her but we were young.\n\nFast forward to 8th grade. IDK if she was depressed or faking it but she started doing some really edgy stuff. she would show up late to school every single day, it was very obvious she was hungover. She kept a journal full of depressing quotes and the coverpage was a wall of bad comments that IG was being said to her? I thought it was edgy so I minded my own business until she told a teacher she took a bunch of her moms meds because of it. \u200bAnd who does she tell them was calling her names? Me. I called her fat and ugly on a few occasions but not enough to make her depressed.The cops got involved and blah blah\n\nShe ended up moving away that year bc of family issues but we stayed in contact. She seemed like she was getting better and I found myself falling for her but i was dating her friend. when she found out she was rlly upset. her sister texted me telling me she drank a whole bottle of vodka by herself a few nights later and i was an aH for making her do thst but I didn't. she tried to break us up by telling my gf I told her I loved her which was true but my gf just ignored it because we both thought she was crazy.\n\nover the next few years we were off and on. we would stop texting for months at a time and see each other once a year. it was obvious that she was really in love with me and she told me so and i told her the same because i guess I kinda did. she was very obsessed though and would befriend my girlfriend and stalk my social media so I tried to push her away.\n\nafter the last time we saw each other, she completely changed. she started getting high/drunk all the time and was even hospitalized.after she got out she texted me telling me how much she hated me and that I ruined her life by always making me the second choice and making her hate herself and her looks. I told her she was delusional because I never did any of that. she said she wish she had never met me because I was the biggest asshole she had ever met. I told her she was crazy and needed help again.\n\nI took screenshots of the conversation and sent them to her mother because I knew her Facebook. i don't really know what I was expecting. ig i just wanted her to calm her daughter down. i didn't hear from her daughter for a few weeks and then she texted me out of the blue saying she got thrown back into the mental hospital because of me showing what she said to her mom. i told her I was just trying to get her the help she needed because clearly the first time didn't help. she told me to never contact her again and blocked me.\n\nit's been a couple months and I feel really bad for it. I just broke up with my girlfriend so it's been really hard but I can't stop thinking about what I did", "created_utc": 1667542351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylqlcw/aita_for_telling_a_girls_mom_about_her_behavior/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should feel responsible for how she is.", "I'm going to say YTA here, you might not have needed to say anything to her folks if you hadn't agreed you loved her despite being her sister and then continuing when you were apart.

But you do seem to be stringing her along - you said you loved her because \u201cyou guess you kind of do\u201d and apparently you also had a different girlfriend? You have to understand that if she was in love with you and you only loved her as a friend, that\u2019s going to be confusing for her and cruel of you. \n\nShe sounds like she does have some issues, but she also sounds pretty manipulative. \n\nI\u2019m hopeful that one day she will understand and forgive you - perhaps even be thankful for your help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
