Being single doesn't obligate you to spend your time helping out someone else just because they have kids. Sheesh!", "NTA. Do NOT let her guilt trip you. If she can\u2019t pay you then it\u2019s not worth your time or gas or the miles you\u2019ll be putting on your car. SHE chose to have children and she is clearly still very immature to have reacted that way.

I'm sorry that your mom expects you to make sacrifices for selfish strangers.  Listen to the opinion of your co-worker, who knows you, the woman who needs the ride, and the situation.  Definitely, NTA and I suspect that you may even have dodged a bullet, as this woman sounds as though she could be the type to gradually ask more and more of you if you had agreed to help her.", "NTA.

You're not obliged to be a free taxi service to ANYONE", "NTA even if she offered you gas money. But she didn't and expects you to offer your time, your car and your money because of her bad planing? Because she has kids? So entitled.", "NTA.

While it would be nice to give your coworker rides, if your financial situation doesn\u2019t allow it you simply shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s bold of her to be upset that you said no when she asked you.

I used to ride with a coworker. I met her at her house so she didn't have to drive any extra distance and I gave her gas money every week. \nThis is one of the risks someone takes by refusing to learn how to drive.

That's not going to cutr it - depreciaton, gas insurance .. 50% of that, AND your time .. that would be needed to make it fair.

Thats extra gas you'd be using and you have every right to ask her for gas money.\n\nAnd if you're going out of you way, that means you have to leave home earlier and get home later.  Just because she's a mom doesn't mean your personal time isn't valuable", "NTA So she's perfectly happy taking up your gas and time for free, but if you dare to ask for fair compensation for just the gas that's not okay? No. To ask for something that expensive and inconvenient from someone you have no close ties to and act like that when they have conditions? Truly audacious and selfish. Also stupid because I certainly wouldn't want to give her a ride even once after that.

It's not your fault she doesn't drive (I say this as an autistic person who refuses to drive) and her family and life situations aren't your problems, either. Since she's going to be nasty to you now for not stroking her insane level of entitlement, I suggest you pick up a copy of the local bus schedule and leave it on her desk.", "NTA. Your car, your time, your money - your decision.\n\nHannah is making unreasonable demands on you, your money and your time. She can call an \u00dcber.

Probably not...)\n\nI've got the feeling that it would start with straight runs to/from work, then suddenly it would be \"I just need you to stop here quickly for whatever\", then \"the weekly grocery shopping\" or \"picking up the kids\".

One of those is learning to drive.  Why doesn't she just take public transport.  And if she lives close enough, perhaps she could ride a pushbike?\n\nAnother option is to pay for an Uber/taxi.  Not paying for gas is rude and entitled even you were considering helping her.", "NTA. She\u2019s an idiot. Also super entitled. Your time is just as valuable, regardless of whether or not you have kids. Which, BTW is none of her business anyway!", "NTA. Tell her it\u2019s gas money or nothing. End of. And get payment upfront.", "NTA, and I'm sorry Hannah is being unreasonable. Offering to help in an occasional emergency is more than fine. Her having children has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. Where does her husband get the gas to drive her to and from work? The gas fairy? That gas comes out of her household finances already.", "NTA. Does your town/city not have public transportation? I can't drive anymore, for medical reasons, so I take the bus to work, not inconvenience coworkers. I get to work almost as fast as I used to drive it; but my office isn't too far, so that helps. She should be getting a bus pass and figuring out the route, if that's an option where you live.", "She's being an absolute PITA and you owe her precisely nothing. Your mother doesn't get to volunteer your time, money and energy to other people she feels sorry for. Your colleague needs to find her own independent solution.

Not your problem", "NTA\n\neven if she offered to pay for gas up front, you are still not obligated to do this. \n\nas you said, it would be ok occasionally if her regular lift wasn\u2019t available. She is unreasonable to expect you to give up your time and the extra costs as if your life is not important. I assume you would have to leave earlier in the morning and get home later because of the extra pick up. Also you are stuck doing this if you wanted to make plans after work.\n\nif she got a family member to pick her up , she can keep that going. You are not responsible for her commute", "NTA. Her having kids doesn't mean she can impose on you or get a free ride.", "NTA. She has two kids and a husband and wants you to run your car to her house and back again without gas money? No. Not today.", "NTA\n\nShe can Uber, take public transport, learn that drive, change her work shifts or get a different job closer to her home.  None of this is your problem.  In addition to your gas, this would take time from your life.", "NTA it doesn't matter if you spend your free time at home staring at a blank wall, it is yours and no one is entitled to it.  You would be a good person/ nice co-worker if you gave her a ride every once in a while. Expecting you to do it daily is ridiculous.", "NTA. I had a coworker like that before. He had a house, his wife was a sahm and she kept the car all day. He did live close to our place of employment but it was in the opposite direction of where I lived. It took extra time from my day and my gas money. He never understood why no one wanted to help when he lived so close to work.  But it wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s responsibility but his own. She needs to figure out transportation on her own.", "Getting your co worker to work is not your responsibility.\n\nShe wants you to incur additional time and expense doing so but doesn't want to give you gas money.

If you have children that is your responsibility and not the responsibility of those around you who for whatever reason do not.\n\nNTA. It sucks for your co-worker, but it's also her responsibility to make sure she can get to and from work each day - not yours. You already offered to occasionally help her out which is generous imo. Unfortunately she seems to be a bit of an r/coosingbeggars here by becoming irate and requesting more.", "And after kidney is provided, Hannah would fire OP for missing work for few days."]}
