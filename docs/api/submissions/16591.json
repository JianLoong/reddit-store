Why should you do this and not even get paid for the inconvenience or extra gas?\n\nYou may not have children, but you also do not have a husband to help pay your rent.\n\nWhat if you find a BF who lives in the opposite direction and want to sleep over? Her life, her money, her problem.", "She asked, you answered. Nothing more to say.  Her issue, not yours.", "NTA your life outside of work is none of her business.  You could have 100 kids or 0 and it should make no difference at work.", "NTA. \n\n\\>  she got mad and said I shouldn't be because I don't have kids of my own so I don't understand her situation\n\nThis alone would make me just never give her a ride. She feels entitled to your time because how could you POSSIBLY be busy without kids. She doesn't deserve your kindness.", "I wouldn't do it just because I'm introverted, and my commute is downtime that is peaceful for me. Accommodating someone else ruins it. I'm willing to help if someone is in a bind, but every single day? Nah.", "NTA\nWhy would you be an AH for not using your time and money for someone you don't like?", "NTA. And I wouldn't be giving her ANY rides anymore. The entitlement!!!", "That\u2019s a big Nope. NTA.", "NTA. You are never required to go out of your way to do stuff.  \nHeck, even if she was on your way, you don't have to.  \nIf it bothers you, map out exactly how many extra miles and minutes it would take you.  \nIf it comes up again, show her.  \nIt's not unreasonable to ask her to pay your extra gas.", "There's an old bumper sticker that solves this perfectly. Cash, gas or (grass or ass ive seen 2 versions), no one rides free.\n\nTime is money and it isn't free.", "NTA, it's her job, her life, her family, and her responsibility. She can Uber, take the bus, use other public transportation, learn to drive... her refusal to take responsibility or plan is not your problem. \n\nThat she wouldn't consider chipping in for gas is troubling and would have been an immediate no without apology from me.", "NTA  *oof* I\u2019ll say the AH truth here: she decided to have kids, so any day-to-day stuff with that is her problem and nobody is an AH for not helping. If she can\u2019t handle the responsibility, maybe she should consider what\u2019s best for the kids going forward (surrendering the kids). Any whining she does along the way makes HER the AH.", "NTA. No one is entitled to special treatment and free stuff just because they let some guy creampie them.", "NTA \n\nWhy does your mom think your co-worker should take advantage of you?", "NTA Your mother is.  You are under no obligation. She decided to have two kids.", "NTA. Why does having kids mean she shouldn\u2019t pay for the expense of her getting a ride to work? \nShe lives in a dual income house, whereas you live alone. Having kids is not an excuse for being indecent.\n\nGas is expensive, and time is precious. If your being inconvenienced for being someone\u2019s ride, then paying for gas is the least she could do. I would be paying for gas, and a coffee/breakfast sandwich.\n\nYour coworker can figure out her own way to work. It is not your responsibility to provide a free ride.", "So her children are the most important thing in the world?", "What a entitled little thing is.  She wants you to go out of your way, pay for the gas, and feel good about it...  I don't think so.  NTAH.", "NTA.", "I was the nice guy who picked people up and dropped them off and didn't ask for anything.", "Vacation/personal/sick days too, if they're allowed to transfer. (Or, if they are competing days off!)", "As of now, I\u2019m no longer taking the time to say \u201cpain-in-the-ass\u201d. \u201cArse-ache\u201d it is!! Thank you Racoon.", "To expand my comment further: Anyone who can only manage to half-ass parenting shouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep kids. Parenting is HUGE in terms of responsibility, and if you aren\u2019t all-in for your kids AND a high performer, you will have these moments where you start to try and share your responsibility with others unfairly. \n\nBest case scenario: you get someone to fill in where you lack and the kids get everything they need in terms of parenting, guidance, nutrition, safety, etc. this is passable parenting, but only by the grace of others (I.e. \u2018it takes a village to raise a kid\u2019). \n\nWorst case: you don\u2019t find others who are both willing and able to pick up your slack and the kids suffer for it.", "That's her and her husband's problem, not yours. He put you in this place, but if you don't want him to work and go every day, just say no and keep saying no until he gives up.", "NTA. Her having kids and not being able to drive isn\u2019t a you problem that\u2019s a her problem. She doesn\u2019t get to put that on you and make that your problem. Also the judgment on being without a child is just rude. I\u2019d be clear you won\u2019t be taken advantage off and if your mom feels so bad for her then she should do it instead.", "NTA! She chose not to learn how to drive! Not your problem!!  She needs to grow up and handle her own shit! The guilt tripping is over the top! You owe her nothing!", "NTA. I'll never get why parents feel that they're better and more important because they had a child. She made the choice to be a parent. You made a reasonable request for her to help with Gas. Her first response was to say how tough she has it as a parents and you have no kids so your life must be amazing. You tried to help, and you were insulted for it. Sucks for her. Do not help her out. She obviously proved to you that if the shoe was on the other foot, she wouldn't help you either.", "Is there public transit where you live? Taxis?\n\nI don\u2019t drive and I\u2019ve managed ti figure out how to get to work and have a life without relying on people to drive me.", "Nta. How exactly is this your problem? You were respectful and made very fair points. Her lack of planning isn't your issue. She sounds entitled thinking you some how owe her this. Also I really dislike people claiming child free people have more time.", "Nta", "NTA.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to demand shit for free and her brood isn\u2019t your problem.", "In my lifetime of working, there were people who I would gladly go out of my for and those I simply don\u2019t want to be trapped with and obligated to on a consistent basis. \n\nRide sharing is fine when the other party understands the situation demands they be flexible and generous. \n\nI think it is already clear this person would soon have you picking up her children and taking them to appointments and sporting events.  Essentially being a de facto extra parent/unpaid nanny.", "NTA.", "NTA. She can get a bus/ train pass or ask someone else to be a free chauffeur.", "Exactly this. PLUS circumstances don't really matter; SHE is an adult with a job, responsible to get herself in and out of said job. Nobody else but her is responsible for that. She can ask for charity from others, but she is entitled to none.", "You should have asked them if they wanted to fuck you in the ass too, I mean if you really wanted to be nice.", "News flash, not everyone is the same."]}
