Have your husband address this issue of \"who will be watching the kids?\" with MIL now so you can decide in advance whether you even want to go on this trip.", "NTA. I recommend you and your husband give a flat no because you don't want to be responsible for the kids all week in their parents' absence, and you're definitely going to be expected to lump them into whatever your own son is doing. (I'm using the plural \"you\", as in both you and your husband will be caring for your son, but I know that might be optimistic. The sentiment is doubled if specifically you and you alone are going to be expected to be a parent on the trip.)", "NTA you'll be miserable the entire time. Don't go", "NTA- Not your kids, not your problem. I would make sure to let them know now that you won\u2019t be babysitting them or paying for them on this trip.", "Nta\n\nYou will 100% end up as the babysit, and they'll have every excuse like 'i drank a wine, I want to swim,...'.\n\nI'm sorry, the trip sounds already ruined before it even started", "Will their mother be coming on vacation too?  If not, clarify who is going to be responsible for them.  If MIL says you and your husband, that doesn't seem fair.  Discuss with your husband and have talk with her re you being pregnant, having a 5 year old and not being able to be responsible for more children.  Best wishes on your pregnancy and hope you can have a relaxing vacation.", "Thank you all so much for the advice and comments!!\nUPDATE:\nMy husband sent a message to his mom saying that we do not want to play baby sitter for his brother's kids and she said she understands and also that she will be taking financial responsibility for them. It's all seeming like everything will be fine. She isnt rude and we do all get along, his brother's kids are just a handful to say the least. Fingers crossed this all works out I am nervous but it is also our daughter's first vacation so we will try our best to have a good time and also put our foot down about not being responsible for the other kids!", "NTA, but you need to state it now before you leave and are expected to look after them. Make sure everyone knows what you will and will not do, so that you can also send your child with the family and relax at home.", "NTA, this is your vacation too, if they want a babysitter they can hire one plain and simple.", "NTA, and the idea that you might have to pay for any extra kids is gobsmacking.", "NTA.\n\n>My MIL wants his kids to still be able to go\n\nShe needs to look after them, not you.", "NTA but your post doesn\u2019t say anyone\u2019s asked you to babysit yet so definitely clear that up before you work yourself up over it. It could be a case that they\u2019ve figured childcare out already (unlikely but fingers crossed) Just make it clear you won\u2019t be up to watching all 5 kids so a different plan needs to be in place.", "NTA. Does brother have a wife? If you are driving 1 or 2 kids, you already know you get to do childcare for those if not all. That means no relaxing. Why wouldn't the brother still provide the money for his kids. Not going doesn't mean not paying for them.", "NTA, if you think you can, ask your MIL about who will be watching them. Express your boundary that you also need some time to rest and recharge. If you are still told that you\u2019ll have to watch them, don\u2019t go. Have a staycation or go on a separate vacation if possible. Get a refund as well if you don\u2019t end up going. I hope it works out for you, and you can get some relaxation in!", "NTA, do not watch them kids!", "NTA. This trip was instigated by your MIK, so she can be babysitter.", "NTA \n\nDefinitely talk with your husband about your concerns and make it clear how you want the vacation to look like. It\u2019s your time as well to relax. Maybe husband can talk with MIL and ask her who she thinks will be taking care of kids for most time?", "NTA.  And you don't have to surrender your trip to keep the peace with MIL.  Seriously.  This is the definition of setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.   Some conflicts are worth getting into.\n\nYou would be doing your part to drive the kids down.  Mom can host them.  Be clear.  This is not up for debate, you aren't going to wait until she accepts the right reason, it isn't happening, and no is a complete sentence.\n\nIf MIL doesn't want to watch the kids the entire time, then she only wants the good feelings she gets for saving the trip for them, and not the hassles they will bring.\n\nYour husband better be planning on doing things with you.  This idea that you will stay behind while he parties down is just nonsense.", "Nta. If you dont take care of this quick (and by take care of i mean your husband needs to take care of) you will be on vacation watching kids and out more money than you can afford. You want to buy your son an ice cream cone? You have to buy one for every kid now. \n\nI actually had a family vacation very much like this and I have made it clear we now do our own vacations with our own time/money. We dont have the extra money to take vacations for other people.", "NAH. MIL just asked if you could drive some of them down, hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about watching kids or paying for things. From the post you didn\u2019t say that she was rude or anything, so none of the information makes her seem like one.You also do not have to watch them if you don\u2019t want to, just ask hey who\u2019s gonna watch the kids the whole time? \n\nThis sub tends to jump on things and overreact when nothings even happened yet.
