I must preface that he\u2019s a bichon poodle so a small white fluffy friendly looking dog, who is very good with people (no aggression at all).  I\u2019m browsing in the pet aisle, and I see someone out of the corner of my eye quite close and so I look over to make sure my dog isn\u2019t in the way. When I do I see a middle aged women leaning down towards my dog making cooing noises and reaching out to pet him. I immediately told her \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u201d and when she asked if he wasn\u2019t friendly I clarified that I don\u2019t let strangers pet my dog. While this isn\u2019t true, i don\u2019t appreciate strangers trying to pet my dog without asking first so that\u2019s usually what I\u2019ll say to those that do. In return she looked at my dog and said \u201coh, don\u2019t wanna get my germs on you\u201d and left. I\u2019ve always thought it was very rude and entitled to touch someone else\u2019s pets (in public) without asking so I always politely reject those who do so to my pets. She seemed quite offended so I\u2019ve been feeling slightly guilty about it.\n\nI asked a couple friends and most of them have said that I should\u2019ve lied and said he wasn\u2019t friendly but I think i shouldn\u2019t have to label my dog as unfriendly or even explain myself to a stranger. Some have even said what\u2019s the harm since my dog isn\u2019t a bite risk. Only a small minority of my friends have agreed that I did the right thing by setting boundaries. So AITA?\n\nEdit. I\u2019d like to add that I\u2019m generally non confrontational so that was the best reason I could come up with for her not to pet my dog besides straight up telling her to ask first.\n\nEdit 2. I didn\u2019t think to add this until now but I\u2019m legally blind (can see shapes and objects well but not fine detail like facial expressions unless very close) and so I also have delayed reactions to people trying to pet my dog because I\u2019m analyzing if they\u2019re actually doing what I think they\u2019re doing before taking action", "created_utc": 1672293542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxxhot/aita_for_telling_someone_not_to_pet_my_friendly/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't care if your dog is aggressive or not, people should be considerate enough to at least ask if they can pet your dog before doing so.

You don't owe anybody an explanation or excuse as to why you've created the boundaries you have, especially a stranger interacting with your pet.

I really emphasize it \"thank you so much for asking permission, first! That's very important, especially for strange animals you don't know!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: IF your dog would have reacted poorly, this person would very likely have held you to blame. This is just another reason to uphold your boundaries. Protecting others as well as your dog. I muzzle my dog when he's in stressful situations. I'm not afraid he'll purposefully bite. I'm afraid that he will become overwhelmed in a situation I cannot protect him in, and because of his breed, he will be blamed for the situation.

Being physically capable of overpowering someone is not an essential component of being a predatory creep.

They are dogs,  that's what they do.   And ffs, he's your dog, not a petting zoo display for bored shoppers.  Would you allow a stranger to fondle your child?  You were right to refuse and in the future, remember that \"No\" is a complete sentence.", "I honestly don't even know how to label you right now.
