Maybe he would change his attitude towards the situation if he knew how much harm his enabling is doing. Maybe he can watch intervention. So many parents enable, and it just makes it so much worse for the person addicted", "INFO\n\nWhy doesn't Daddy take him into his home?", "NTA", "Nta, protect you and your family", "Controversial but NAH.\n\nI've been in a position eerily similar to your dad. For me though, it was my best friend.\n\nMy friend had struggled for years with his mental health. He was schizophrenic, depressed, and anxious. He abused drugs and alcohol from a young age, and only got diagnosed with his schizophrenia after the drug abuse started. The medical system wouldn't give him medication for it because our local doctor decided that he would abuse it.\n\nHe struggled for years. He was the kindest, smartest, most charismatic person you've ever met. Then a switch would flip, and he was filled with rage and delusions. He went to multiple rehabs and was forcibly hospitalized multiple times, all while still living with his family. He kept leaving the facilities, would do fine for a few weeks and then fall back into his old addictions. \n\nWhen he was 20 and left another rehab, his family couldn't take it anymore. They wouldn't take him in, and his mom even called his friends, asking that we don't take him in, in hopes that having nowhere to go would push him back to the rehab facility. When he called me though, I couldn't say no. I know what the facilities are like. The employees there were all graduated patients, people who had overcome their problems and want to help others do the same. Except they hadn't, they kept using and started getting drugs for the patients. In my mind, it better he was with him than dying on the street, or being doped up again by another worthless orderly looking for a quick buck.\n\nSo I took him in, and he lived with me for almost a year. In that time, he changed a lot, and I saw firsthand just how bad his schizophrenic meltdowns could be when he tried to forcibly hang himself off of my 2nd floor balcony with an extension cord. But I also saw him smile more than I ever saw before. My brother got him a job detailing at a car dealership with him, and things were good.\n\nThe mistake I made was continuing with my own plan for life. I moved to a different province to start building my life up, and he relapsed while I was gone. His mom messaged me to tell me that he passed away from an overdose in October. We never got him the schizophrenia medication that he needed in the end. \n\nStability isn't enough. To help someone through complex mental health and substance issues, you need to provide economic and housing stability, to isolate them from the substances, to have them under near constant observation, to show them immense empathy and eventually trust, and to directly treat their problems through therapy, psychiatric help, and a proper, aggressive plan of medication.\n\nThere are no assholes here. Everyone is just trying to do the best they can with what they have. Your dad is trying to do right by his son who he knows needs help, your mom is trying to do right by the two of you, and you are doing the same as your mom. Your dad can't just take your step brother in and hope for the best, but I hope this helps you at least understand why he's trying so hard.\n\nI know that's probably not a satisfactory answer OP, and I wish I could give you one, but the answer to your problem is whatever you decide. There is no right or wrong here, just whatever you all choose to do. If you need to talk about your situation or have any questions about how to handle certain things, feel free to DM me. Good luck OP.", "No. Everything \"helping him along\" is enabling. He needs to fix himself or he'll probably end up dead. It won't be anyone's fault but his.

So, bringing him in, you risk your safety and that of your properties (won't be long till he sells or pawn them off for drugs).", "NTA\n\nYou know where he can go with a roof, a bed, and 3 meals a day? \n\nRehab", "He can fuck right off over a bridge.

I appreciate your input though.", "No, it isn't your house. You shouldn't get a say.", "This is so sad, and so common. I hope he\u2019ll start listening. There\u2019s nothing stopping his son from getting violent with him. Saving him all the time isn\u2019t gonna help the way he thinks it will. He\u2019ll end up regretting it", "NTA \n\nAnd if I read you right, wtf???\n\nSo it's okay for SS to go bat shit psycho on you, but not Daddio the Guilt tripper?", "That's an entirely fair position to have. I don't begrudge you for it the same way I don't begrudge my friend's family for refusing. You've dealt with it for years, and you deserve security and rest. I hope you all manage to figure things out okay.

Why wouldn\u2019t it be? They say they have equal veto rights.  Sounds like an adult living with mom in a more roommate situation.  It\u2019s rude to just assume it\u2019s still a parent/child situation.  NTA OP, by the way.

Surely old enough to live alone yourself", "So Dad doesn't have the money to put him in a strict rehab facility but has sympathy and wants to use the family home as a rehab I guess?\n\nNTA, it's always better to put them in proper medical centers with professionals given that none of you are quipped to handle his illness."]}
