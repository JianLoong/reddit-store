We are engaged but have no set wedding date due to issues that keep arising. One of those being him needing to have surgery which occurred on Monday. \n\nAs scheduled, we checked into the hospital Sunday evening. This was his first time going under the knife, we both were nervous but he was especially uneasy. I stayed with him the entire night, there wasn\u2019t much sleep considering the level of anxiety and with the nurses coming and going. \n\nThe surgery itself was moderately risky. As the doctor said, it\u2019s not perfectly ideal but he has age on his side. By morning he seemed to settle down. They took us to the pre-op holding room. Once in there he said, \u201cListen, if anything bad happens\u2026call your mom.\u201d My mom? Call my mom? Really? What an odd request. I thought for sure he was going to say if anything happens, I love you. Nope\u2026call your mom. \n\nThe more I thought about it, the more pissed off I became. I asked him, do you think I\u2019m not capable of handling things should something go wrong? He said, \u201cI\u2019d prefer your mom be with you to help you make decisions.\u201d Ok so he doesn\u2019t fully trust me and feels I need to have my mother \u2018supervise\u2019 me through the process should something go wrong. I mean, God forbid if he passed on the operating table of course I\u2019d call my mom. But he wasn\u2019t even talking about that. And what exactly is my mom supposed to do\u2026gang bust into the operating room and body slam the doctors out of the way so she can work on him? \n\nWe started arguing about it. I was getting increasingly frustrated so I ended up telling him that I\u2019ll just go home and have my mom come to the hospital right now so she can be his advocate. As I walked out, he called me a \u2018dumbass\u2019 and the said, \u201cThanks.\u201d I didn\u2019t leave the hospital, I went to the waiting room and remained there until the doctor came out. About 15 minutes before he came to get me, I started feeling bad because yeah if something does happen, we left off arguing which we never do. \n\nThe remainder of the day we didn\u2019t speak much about anything because he was off and on sleeping, in pain so I sat with him quietly. The next day he was kind of cold towards me, but honestly I let the entire thing go by then. Wednesday afternoon he was discharged home. My mom called just shortly after getting home to ask if she could bring us dinner. I appreciated the offer because I hadn\u2019t even thought about dinner yet. \n\nI asked him if he was ok with her coming over with dinner because I know for myself after a hospital stay I may or may not be up for visitors coming over, depending on how I feel. His response was, \u201cWell that\u2019s up to you because I don\u2019t want you to feel like your mother can cook better than you do.\u201d Because she was still on the phone and overheard what he said, she wanted to know what he meant. When she arrived, I told her what had happened. She was flattered he asked for her, then said I overreacted and scolded me for leaving him alone in pre-op.", "created_utc": 1684513042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m053b/aita_for_walking_out_and_leaving_my_partner_alone/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He requested if anything bad happens to him, that I call my mom. I was irritated by his request, as it insinuated that I wasn\u2019t capable of handling things on my own or that he didn\u2019t trust me. We ended up having an argument and I left him alone in pre-op. I began feeling like an AH for arguing with him instead of just saying ok and lashing it out later. I let things go but he found the opportunity to fire back. Him and my mom are on the same side. Both of them are not taking my feelings into consideration.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The last cancer surgery I could completely see myself telling my husband to call his sister if something went wrong. \n\nNot because I don\u2019t trust him. Not because I don\u2019t have absolute faith in him. But because I love him, and I know the pain and despair that he will be in, and I will want the person who will bring him the greatest comfort in his time of need. \n\nSorry, but YTA. Your husband was only thinking about you. \ud83d\ude15", "Wow YTA\n\n\nHe is the one having surgery...he's terrified. \n\nHe knows that you are also scared and that you've been there for him. So, he tells you that, if anything goes wrong, he wants to know you are being supported. \n\n\nAnd your response is to lash out at him. That he thinks you can't handle yourself? Ummm...obviously you can't.", "YTA. Your level of anger makes no sense. This is extremely petty and ridiculous. Right before he has surgery no less! You sound exhausting. At a time when he needed rest and assurance (I\u2019m sure he was scared), you have a blow out over something so minor? Like what even is this?", "YTA he made a simple request because he wanted to make sure you had the support you might need in order to be able to support him. He was scared. He wanted the security of extra hands on deck. \n\n\nAnd you made it about you. You took it in the worst possible light and made his small reasonable request into an insult and personal attack on you. And you left him without any support at all. \n\n>  I appreciated the offer because I hadn\u2019t even thought about dinner yet. \n\nWow, sure seems like your mom is a good person to have on hand when you're stressed out and emotional. Too bad no one thought to call her.\n\n\nI mean... tbh, I wouldn't trust you to prioritize my care while I was incapacitated if this is how you handle things. It's too bad your mother wasn't already there so he would have at least had someone there with him while you went off to be a drama queen and have a tantrum.", "yta - he was probably thinking that you would not be thinking straight because the person you loved just died. therefore, he wanted someone he know was a strong positive force in your life to be there for you.", "Damn you're cold. YTA.", "YTA. You turned a potentially life-threatening surgery that he was understandably anxious about; into something about you.\n\nHe wanted you to have support should the worst happen, and you threw it in his face.\n\nThe funny thing is, given the way you behaved, your mother would probably have been the better choice to have there should something awful happen.\n\nI think you should take a step back and think about how you feel. It seems to me that you were sonewhat jealous of your mother. As well as upset that your partner thought you might need help in the event his surgery does not go according to plan.", "YTA so much.\n\n\"The surgery itself was moderately risky. As the doctor said, it\u2019s not perfectly ideal but he has age on his side.\"\n\nIn the surgeon's own words, this was a risky surgery.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 was very nervous, even scared about the surgery.  In the event he didn't pull through, he asked that you call your mother.  For you.  He asked you call your mother so you wouldn't be alone.  And you spun that into a negative and took it as a criticism of your capabilities.  And left him alone!\n\nWow.\n\nWhen my mum visited her 91 yo mother for the  last time, as she was saying good bye, about to get on a plane and fly 3,000 miles away, my grandmother looked at her and said, next time bring Wally (my dad).  Did she say that because she thought my mum was incapable?  No, she was thinking of my mum not having to do this all by herself.  It was the last time they spoke as my grandmother died 2 days later.  And indeed, the next time she came, my dad was with her.\n\nYou owe your financ\u00e9 a heart-felt apology for abandoning him in his time of need, when he was so vulnerable and scared. I don't know how, but you need to make it up to him and work to gain his trust. \n\nYou may find he's not in a rush to set a date.", "YTA  He was thinking of you having someone by your side.  You had a very childish reaction taking it in the worst possible way.  He was thinking of you & you were thinking of yourself.", "YTA. You actually proved that he cannot rely on you.", "YTA.\n\nThis post screams that we're missing information, but there's really no scenario where you weren't in the wrong for making your partner *think that you left him alone before a major surgery.* \n\nThe only way I can see for him to also be in the wrong is if he slept with your mother, which somehow I doubt, or if you hate your mom.\n\nHe was thinking both of his own wellbeing-- people who are freaking out because their partner is dying aren't exactly known for their rational decision-making-- *and* of yours. If you call your mom, you have someone there to support you, to take notes and ask questions, to coordinate, and to be a shoulder to cry on. Chances are your mom also has not only way more life experience than you, but also more experience dealing with doctors and insurance. He was being thoughtful of you and looking out for himself, and you were a giant asshole in return.\n\nYou sound *unbelievably* self-centered, to have made his surgery all about your feelings. Are you really so very insecure that even the slightest indication that someone thinks you may need help sends you into a rage?", "[removed]", "YTA, are you always this unnecessarily sensitive? ESP in a high risk situation? C\u2019mon dude, the one time your partner *needed* you, you completely dropped the ball straight into the underworld.", "YTA.\n\nHe could have died, was scared as hell, and probably wasn't thinking that clearly. Let it go.", "Not only are you the biggest AH but you may possibly be the biggest dumb asshole. \n\nHoly overreaction Batman. Maybe bring a book next step instead of creating insane things in your head. \n\nYou better apologize profusely to your poor husband who was only looking out for you. And you better apologize before he realizes he married a crazy person.", "Info: this seems like an unreasonable leap on your end, is there a reason or history you have to assume he doubted your ability to make decisions or him siding with your mom over your opinion?", "YTA; I think he was scared, and it's not that he doesn't trust you but rather he doesn't want you to have to be alone. Sometimes saying \"I love you\" before hand can add to the fear too. You also could have been the one to say you loved him.", "YTA\n\nTf?! Honestly you fought with him, RIGHT BEFORE A RELATIVELY RISKY SURGERY, and are confused hes cold towards you? What was the problem even? The fact he'd rather have someone with you in case he passes, so you didn't have to go through that pain alone? \n\nAnd you fought with him for that. Jesus Christ.", "YTA he was looking out for you", "LOL \"what do you mean I'm not good in stressful situations?\" Then goes off on a Mad full-on toddler level temper tantrum strop.\n\nMost people after reading their own post on this would be like.... Ohhhhhhh THAT's what he means.. I should let mom deal with this because he views her as a level headed adult and not a stroppy child.\n\nLike, that stings and all but he's not wrong, but you are and YTA.", "YTA. He was afraid and had worst case scenarios running through his head and wanted both of you to have the benefit of additional support. It was a reasonable request. But you decided to take it personally, argue with him, and leave him to sit in his fear alone. You were straight up mean and insensitive. You say you've already gotten over it, but this isn't about you... it's about you leaving him in the lurch in one of the most vulnerable situations he's experienced over something extremely petty. This is the type of thing that would make someone rethink an engagement. You need to do damage control. Now. Apologize and admit that you let your ego get in the way of supporting him, and you hope that he can forgive you for letting him down when he needed you.", "YTA. You completely overreacted to his comment, which was likely meant as \"call your mom so she can support you\" and not the way you took it. To argue with someone when they're already super anxious and about to have a risky surgery is just kind of heartless. Did you think about the fact he went into surgery thinking he had been left completely alone? That's cold.", "YTA. Having surgery can be extremely anxiety inducing. You should have supported your partner instead of making it about you and your feelings. Unless someone is actually abusive (which he wasn't in any way), then times like heading into surgery are times that you need to suck it up and be the calm one.", "YTA. You took a simple request of his that was given out of genuine concern for your welfare, and turned it into some weird disrespect marathon.", "You just proved why he preferred your mom's decision making skills than yours. YTA.", "YTA. OP, you sound incredibly exhausting and really easily irritable. What he said was normal and thoughtful. He was thinking of YOU, not himself. Your reaction was not normal. Then you just walked out? In a healthy relationship, even if your partner says something really minor that bothers you, you don\u2019t walk out on them during a time of need. This whole thing honestly seems bizarre.\n\nDo you have a therapist? If not, I strongly suggest you find one. If not for you, for the sake of your relationship (although not sure it will last after this incident). If your fianc\u00e9 posted his side of the story on this sub, most people would be telling him to run.", "YTA. What a ridiculous, childish overreaction to his entirely reasonable request (and note: his request was one that also was meant to make sure you'd have emotional support present if something went terribly wrong for him)", "You seem a bit old to act like this. YTA", "YTA You read a whole lot into a sentence.", "INFO -\n\nWhy are you with your partner? You seem to actively resent him. \n\nYes, you\u2019re an asshole. You couldn\u2019t suck it up while your partner was waiting to go into a risky surgery and threw a temper tantrum instead. \n\nYTA", "YTA - he doesn\u2019t want your mom there to supervise you, he wants her to support you in case you have difficult decisions to make.", "YTA Your fiance wanted to make sure you had support and comfort not supervision in case anything happened during the surgery. You blew an innocent commnet way out of proportion. From my own experience, before you have surgery your mind is in a hundred places and you worried about the people you care about if anything goes wrong. You completely missed the boat and overreacted.", "YTA his surgery was not about you!!!", "YTA. Maybe he was worried about ***you*** dealing with all of the stuff that would have to be dealt with and wanted to be sure that you had help.  I get that this was more to **help** you, OP, nothing more.  I don't see how you feel like he didn't trust you. Your capabilities weren't called into question.\n\nIt doesn't sound like this was the last word he screamed to you down the hallway, and I'm sure that he would have said he loved you at some point as you were still there in the pre-op room.", "YTA \n\nYou made that comment into a much bigger thing than it was and I don\u2019t think he meant any of the negative connotations you placed on it", "YTA, you made yourself the main character in his drama, not fair.", "YTA. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to actually lose a loved one. In your rational everyday life yeah you don\u2019t need your mom to hold your hand and make your choices but when my cousin died in surgery we couldn\u2019t pick his wife up off the floor when they told her she died. She couldn\u2019t drive she couldn\u2019t even catch her breath. You acted like a complete brat when he was just thinking of you and made what had to be a scary moment worse. I wouldn\u2019t be expecting a wedding if I were you.", "Good thing the wedding hasn't happened yet so he can leave your ass without legal matters to worry about.

Nope\u2026call your mom.\n\nSounds like you decided to have a fit before he was even able to finish. It wasn't like he was being rolled away and his last words were that. You were talking with him. Because you decided to get pissed right then and there, you inadvertently made sure his last words to you before the surgery were not pleasant. I'm guessing there's a good chance that if you had not overreacted that before he went to surgery, his last words before the surgery would have been I love you.\n\nYTA", "YTA. ALL surgery comes with some element of risk. This being the first time he\u2019s operated on, he understandably is highly nervous and anxious and wants extra support, so he asks you to call YOUR mother if something happens to him, and your reaction is to take it as a snub and leave.\n\nOP, from reading some of your other comments, you sound like a person who actively looks for reasons to be offended. The kind of person who reads WAY too much into simple things, spins them into the worst scenario, and then acts like your negative imaginings are real.\n\nDo yourself a favor, print out this post and take it to a psychiatrist so they can figure out where your thought process goes wrong and how to help you overcome it, because the issue here is definitely you.", "YTA, I hope he realizes his mistake and breaks off the engagement.\n\nYou sound like an awful person.", "I'm going to go ahead and vote YTA. His request is actually very reasonable. In times of fresh grief, people don't necessarily know what to do or how to process and that sort of thing. He was looking out for you. That means more than saying \"I love you\" which I'm sure, had you not stormed off, he likely would have said before being wheeled in.", "YTA. No offense but it seems like quite a petty thing to make a fuss about in any circumstances, never mind these circumstances...", "YTA -  it sounds like he wanted her there as support for you in the event of something catastrophic happening, not questioning your capability.", "YTA - Reflect on how you flipped out and overreacted to his request. Now consider why he made the request. Looks to me like he knows you are prone to flipping out and going to pieces. And you made his case.", "YTA\n\nWhen I had a medium risk surgery, I told my husband that if something went wrong,  he should call a specific friend of mine.  That person is a great advocate,  loves my husband almost as much as I do and knows my wishes as completely as he does.  I asked that of him because I didn't want him trying to navigate complicated medical questions  and make difficult decisions alone when he'd undoubtedly be scared, sad and a hundred other emotions.  I wanted him to have backup that we both trusted,  literally,  with my life. \n\nIn your case, your reaction kinda proves that you shouldn't be making big decisions by yourself when you're under tremendous stress.", "YTA", "YTA.

I've had several surgeries, and so has my wife, and you know what we don't do? Get mad or pick a fight with whoever is about to go under. Granted, it's usually more like *I* don't react to anything my wife says because surgery and hospitals don't scare me, whether or not I'm the patient, and she's always the terrified one, but still.", "Yep. YTA. I suspect you have completely read something in to his comment that wasn\u2019t there. I suspect his meaning was he wanted you to have support, not for your mother to make decisions rather than you. There are clearly some communication issues here and you need to work on them but the continuing  pettiness is ridiculous.", "YTA. You doubled down on his anxieties and fear. Rather than communicating like an adult you left.", "YTA.  He was trying to look out for you.  If anything had happened, you would have been ab emotional mess and not thinking clearly.

If you were my intended, you wouldn't be anymore.", "YTA \nBased off your other comments it\u2019s clear you have an issue wit your fianc\u00e9 wanting an older persons support. I\u2019m having a hard time accepting how it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t trust you, with it seeming more like he wants an older voice of reason since he doesn\u2019t have one of his own.

You took a moment when he likely needed both and then turned it against him right before he went through something that had the potential to be traumatic", "YTA You interpreted his request to have  the most insulting motivation possible and left him alone while he was preparing to go into surgery.

Never in a million years would I do this as he was heading into surgery. \n\nI know as the caretaker you are under a lot of stress, but you do not pick a petty fight over nothing and make them feel as though they\u2019re alone being rolled back to surgery.

You sound exhausting. Terrible partner", "So you knew he was terrified, and you just left him?? Alone?? Before surgery??? YTA x10000. Your level of anger is odd, and you should have waited until AFTER the surgery to argue about it.", "YTA! If my husband were having surgery, he wouldn't have to tell me to call my mom if something went wrong because my mom would already be there. I promise, having support in difficult times is NOT a bad thing.", "YTA  he didn't think you were incapable of making decisions he wanted to make sure that you weren't alone Incase something happened to him that way your mom would be able to comfort and support you if something did happen.", "That honestly left me speechless at first... that honestly would be a deal breaker, I've been with my boyfriend for 8 years and at a moment he needed my support more than I've ever seen him and I give him a pissy attitude over something so petty, that would be relationship ending for us. How selfish would I have to be? It shows a serious lack of understanding and that I clearly don't care enough about him that something so petty would cause me to leave him on a hospital bed?!

I say this respectfully: you may need to unpack some issues in therapy before getting married.", "Yeah YTA here. People going into surgery will say all kinds of odd things and requests because they are worried and anxious.  You got bent all out of shape with his request getting offended and thinking the worst and not thinking of your BF and his fears and what he was about to go thru while he was still thinking of YOU just in case something went wrong.  You should have sucked it up and comforted him and tabled this issue for a discussion MUCH later.  He needed you in pre-op to be there for him and he went into his procedure likely very upset and worried.  Not a good move.", "YTA and yikes. Dude was thinking about you and your well-being and you decided screw you", "YTA, oh no, your fiance wanted you to have a support system of something really bad happened to him which would not allow him to be your support system, what a truly atrocious person who deserved to be abandoned right before a risky surgery by the person who supposedly wants to marry them.  Are you always this dramatic and do you always twist things up to make them into an insult to you?  No wonder you don't have a date set, I can't imagine how awful wedding planning with you would be if this is how you reacted to your fiance just wanting to make sure you had support from someone you trusted if the worst happened to him.", "YTA. You took \u2018over-thinking\u2019 on a long joy ride.", "Yes you are the asshole.", "You mentioned he is effectively estranged from his own parents. What's the relationship dynamic between him and his parents? I'm leaning YTA if he trusts your mother over his own family.", "YTA. While it's an odd request and I see why it would be upsetting, you need to remember that he's about to go through SURGERY. You just left them to be terrified alone because of unsuccessful comment. \nCouldn't wait with at least after you know he's safe?", "INFO: is your mom in the medical field?", "YTA but I am curious was there any context that he gave explaining why he wanted you to call your mom? \n\nIn my mind I see it as quite caring, if anything happens call your mom. Why? Because he doesn\u2019t want you to be alone during a traumatic event. He doesn\u2019t want you to feel like you have to burden the decisions alone. I feel like from what I\u2019ve seen, when people lose someone important a part of them shuts down and it can be hard to cope or be mentally capable enough to make some of the hard decisions. It\u2019s not saying anything about who you are as a person either. (I could also be wrong, just speaking from personal experience). Grief has a huge impact so I can see where he was coming from a place of caring and love. \n\nNow if you have more context and he gave reasonings that we\u2019re AH-ish than obviously the judgment would change. But I have a feeling if he did give the reasons and they made him look like an AH, you would\u2019ve already mentioned them.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA - it's not a question of trust but likely he wanted someone there with you to support you just in case. You handled this so incredibly poorly.", "YTA. He needed you the most right before going under the knife, and you see his request as a sign of distrust? Unbelievable.", "YTA\n\nThe person in the hospital bed kind of gets a free pass to say pretty much whatever. Your response is \"OK honey, I love you\".", "After reading your comments major Yta. How can you now see how seriously wrong you are. I think you might be jealous that your husband trusts your mom period. You would benefit from some therapy because you\u2019re reaction there and on here are unhinged.", "Op YOU ARE THE AHOLE!!!\n\nYou abandoned your poor husband right before his surgery? What's wrong with you?? even if u wanted to argue with him couldn't u waited atleast when he would recovered.. wtf!

Sometimes saying I love you is different words and actions. Here he was saying he loves you by making sure you had someone to be your rock if he couldn't. You in turn left him at a very vulnerable time and caused him more anxiety. You brushed it off but obviously he was very hurt by this.

And while we think \"well duh, of course it is, I'd do \\[XYZ\\],\" sometimes our brains just bluescreen from the stress and the autopilot that kicks in doesn't always do what we need most. If you're traditionally a very strong and independent personality and tend to take on more than most people do in hard situations, he may also be worried you would try to solo those tough calls on your own before your support network is there to help.\n\nHe may also have been simply trying to minimize his own anxieties and fears pre-op by stating obvious things to feel a semblance of control in a situation where he was feeling no control over his own fate.\n\nI think your mom is right, you may have overreacted, but given the situation at the time, you were both in a fragile place.

And his relationship.", "NTA- From what I am gathering based on the post and comments this is not a new issue in your relationship. \n\nIt is not like you reacted like this out of nowhere. This is a reaction based on years of him valuing your moms decision making skills over even asking your opinion as his partner in the first place or undermining the decisions you and he have made in favor of your mother's opinions. This is based on years of him prioritizing the relationship with the mother over the needs of his partner. \n\nThis was a reaction based on him once again disregarding your feelings not only about a topic he knows is going to trigger a fight but that you have been very clear causes resentment and deeply hurts you. He knew this and chose to bring up your mother and he was not looking out for you but because he trusts her more. He has shown this time and time again. \n\nNow the fact that you are both are under a lot of stress and sleep deprived just added fuel to the fire that has already been burning for a while. I think anyone would expect thier partner to say I love you in this situation and instead of validating the deep commitment of your relationship he brings your mom into it. \n\nNow could you have made different choices and not walked out, sure. However, chosing to leave a situation which was escalating to a fight is exactly what therapists say to do. Giving your self the time to cool down so you can actually think instead of just reacting is good. Had you stayed I am not sure you would even feel bad about your reaction because you would have been stewing in resentment and hurt. \n\nWas your parting words really necessary, nope. You were deliberately lashing out to hurt him in your response to him hurting you. This reaction isnt immature it is very normal.

I get she was trying to be nice by bring over dinner but the fact that she is also dismissing ops feelings and inserting herself into their relationship is telling. Why is mom more invested in her relationship with the partner than her daughters feelings. Why is she not backing off when she knows the resentment that her daughter is experiencing. It is honestly not to much to ask that mom does not encourage the partner to take her opinions more seriously than her daughters who is actually in the relationship.", "Honestly, with context I'm gonna say ESH.

We are engaged but have no set wedding date due to issues that keep arising. One of those being him needing to have surgery which occurred on Monday. \n\nAs scheduled, we checked into the hospital Sunday evening. This was his first time going under the knife, we both were nervous but he was especially uneasy. I stayed with him the entire night, there wasn\u2019t much sleep considering the level of anxiety and with the nurses coming and going. \n\nThe surgery itself was moderately risky. As the doctor said, it\u2019s not perfectly ideal but he has age on his side. By morning he seemed to settle down. They took us to the pre-op holding room. Once in there he said, \u201cListen, if anything bad happens\u2026call your mom.\u201d My mom? Call my mom? Really? What an odd request. I thought for sure he was going to say if anything happens, I love you. Nope\u2026call your mom. \n\nThe more I thought about it, the more pissed off I became. I asked him, do you think I\u2019m not capable of handling things should something go wrong? He said, \u201cI\u2019d prefer your mom be with you to help you make decisions.\u201d Ok so he doesn\u2019t fully trust me and feels I need to have my mother \u2018supervise\u2019 me through the process should something go wrong. I mean, God forbid if he passed on the operating table of course I\u2019d call my mom. But he wasn\u2019t even talking about that. And what exactly is my mom supposed to do\u2026gang bust into the operating room and body slam the doctors out of the way so she can work on him? \n\nWe started arguing about it. I was getting increasingly frustrated so I ended up telling him that I\u2019ll just go home and have my mom come to the hospital right now so she can be his advocate. As I walked out, he called me a \u2018dumbass\u2019 and the said, \u201cThanks.\u201d I didn\u2019t leave the hospital, I went to the waiting room and remained there until the doctor came out. About 15 minutes before he came to get me, I started feeling bad because yeah if something does happen, we left off arguing which we never do. \n\nThe remainder of the day we didn\u2019t speak much about anything because he was off and on sleeping, in pain so I sat with him quietly. The next day he was kind of cold towards me, but honestly I let the entire thing go by then. Wednesday afternoon he was discharged home. My mom called just shortly after getting home to ask if she could bring us dinner. I appreciated the offer because I hadn\u2019t even thought about dinner yet. \n\nI asked him if he was ok with her coming over with dinner because I know for myself after a hospital stay I may or may not be up for visitors coming over, depending on how I feel. His response was, \u201cWell that\u2019s up to you because I don\u2019t want you to feel like your mother can cook better than you do.\u201d Because she was still on the phone and overheard what he said, she wanted to know what he meant. When she arrived, I told her what had happened. She was flattered he asked for her, then said I overreacted and scolded me for leaving him alone in pre-op.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Either way, I've been in situations that are very stressful like what OP has described and I could easily see emotions running high and things being said or construed incorrectly where the individuals may not act that way normally (which is why I didn't reach for the ESH tag).\n\nI don't really think people are assholes when these things happen (outside of targeted malicious intent disconnected from the situation itself), I just think people need to give each other the space to calm down and communicate better afterwards.", "She was throwing a tantrum over him asking her to call her mom (who seems to be a mother figure to him as well) to be there to help her with decisions if there were complications, and then she told him she was leaving him alone before a major surgery! \n\nAs far as he knew she was walking out of the room and going home, meaning he was gonna wake up alone and hospital would have to get hold of her by phone if there were complications. \n\nShit dude, I'd call someone a dumbass too if they did something so cruel to me because they were having a major overreaction to something completely normal.", "Girl you just used an alt account to agree with yourself.", "Did you come here for actual judgement, or just in an attempt to be vindicated? So far, this is the ONE comment that thinks you were in the right. Do you want to actual address your issues with your fiance, or just cling to the extreme minority of people who will agree with you?", "LOL, typical. Gravitate to the only comment on your side. Between this and your other comments, I can only come to the conclusion that you have some insane need to be the only right person, at all costs. You know who else thinks like this? Narcissists.", "You said he has \"issues with his parents and they\u2019re nonexistent\" so he would be angry for a completely different reason if the roles were reversed.", "Wow maybe he wanted your mom there because your an emotional child who can\u2019t keep there emotions in check. Looking at your comments I\u2019d bet it is especially considering you couldn\u2019t wait to have the fight till after he might die you child.", "You feel like a child and you're acting like one, so at least you're consistent.", "Op, please don\u2019t ignore the sea\u2019s of YTA just to focus on this one NTA. The issue is not your capability. You could have reacted totally differently to his statement. He was the one going under the knife. And if roles were reversed, the same rules applies; the one undergoing a potentially dangerous situation should be granted some leniency. The other is there to SUPPORT.", "Get couple s therapy asap so he can get the message he s YOUR PARTNER not your mother's.\n\n And if he keeps disrespecting you and your feelings you are done.\n\n I judge nah due to the lack of sleep and stress/worries on both of you in this case only otherwise he's the ah for walking all over you to ask your mother disregarding what you think and feel.\n\nIt's great he loves and respect your mom but he needs to cut the apron strings and start giving you the respect you deserve as his partner and equal .", "You literally admitted in a comment that he barely has a relationship w his family so of course he\u2019d be mad if you wanted to call them however your bf told obviously sees your mom as a mother figure seeing as his own relationship w his mom is bad", "How do you get \"high risk surgery\" when she stated it was moderately risky?", "She didn\u2019t actually work in the medical field but she was employed for 20 yrs with the local hospital chain. She worked at an office building separate from the hospitals processing paperwork and data. She doesn\u2019t have actual medical knowledge or proper training.", "She had our daughter the entire time, and actually she\u2019s still with her. She\u2019s coming home over the weekend so I could focus on taking care of him at home. And I said I hadn\u2019t thought about dinner YET. It was still early, not dinner time when my mom called to ask if she could bring dinner over.", "No I\u2019m irritated that a lot of things in our lives have to be ran by her first. Like I wanted to refinance our house. He says\u2026let\u2019s talk to your mom about it before we jump into anything. Why would we need to talk to her? She\u2019s not the bank or a financial advisor.

If I had a family member like that and I needed to make a tough judgment call, I'd absolutely ask them, if I had the time to do so.\n\nHow do you know that it's because he doesn't think you're capable? You have made a ton of assumptions on what his intent was.", "So you would\u2019ve gotten dinner taken care of eventually and your daughter was with your mom? That\u2019s better, but I\u2019m still sticking with YTA because, again, you were mainly thinking of yourself when you snapped at your partner, not about him or your daughter.", "Your problem is that your fianc\u00e9 trusts your mother too much? A lot of people would love to have your \"problem.\" So many conflicts arise between in-laws. \n\nYou have such an enviable situation here. Quit fighting it and use your mother to help you.", ">And its ALWAYS yOuR mOm. Like never my dad, my uncle, my grandparents, the neighbor, his 1st grade teacher. aSk YoUr MoM\n\nBecause he trusts and respects your mom. That's generally seen as a good thing. Refinancing a home is a big thing to do, and its helpful to get advice from another person. Would you actually feel better if he wanted to talk to your dad instead? Or would you be upset that he was looking for advice from another person?", "How would you feel if he did have a good relationship with his family and he was always calling his parents?\n\nMy partner often calls his parents to ask for advice on things like finances and other things. \n\nAs humans we often want our parents to help us out, guide us, and support us. Even as adults. I think it\u2019s natural. And it sounds like he may be leaning on your mom more because this is the first time in his life he *has* had a mom to lean on.", "It is an absolutely awful time to refinance. It sounds like you think you have everything under control and don\u2019t want to learn or grow.", "As someone who\u2019s worked in the mortgage/\nrefinancing world, it\u2019s actually a good idea to ask people in your circle that you trust for advice. Your bank and financial advisor aren\u2019t going to lie to you but their biggest concern is getting more money for the bank, not you.", "Bro, you're jealous of your mom lol", "He trusts your mom and probably misses having one. This whole argument could have been avoided though if he had advanced directives. You can use a form online and answer all the questions about how you want certain situations handled. Then share it with the doctors. It\u2019s especially important in situations like this where a person is estranged from their next of kin. You may not have the legal right to make decisions for him if he\u2019s incapacitated. Both of you should look into this in case something else happens. NAH for the situation as it unfolded in the hospital. You were both very stressed. But maybe E S H for not having a plan already in place and for still fighting about it. It sounds like there\u2019s some stuff to work out between you two with regard to how much he depends on your mom and how much you don\u2019t like it.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you indicate it wouldn't be as bothersome if he brought other adults into it such as a father or uncle reeeeally makes it seem like you are jealous of your mother.\n\nHe trusts her in a way it sounds like he could never trust his own mother. Can't say I've ever heard of a couple fighting because he likes in in-laws too much.", "If your fiance has emotional issues around family and parents because his own family is shitty, it's not surprising that he might view your mom as a surrogate mother, and have an unusually strong connection to that relationship. If he didn't get maternal love and support growing up but now has free access to it from your mom, it makes sense that his attachment to her would be strong.\n\nIf he's basically taken her as his adoptive mother, then this is all totally normal. I would call my mom before I refinanced my house. That's normal. He doesn't have a mom of his own so he calls yours. \n\nYour rage at this fact seems excessive, irrational, and childish. More importantly, you appear to be incapable of extending any empathy to your partner. Not once do you appear to have considered why he might be doing this. \n\nHave you ever seen a psychologist?", "Yes, you did. The key to using an alt is changing the tone and inflection, while not using the same exact attitude. You at least have to try to pretend to be a different person.", "Yes.", "Not when you walk all over your partner to ask her Mom s opinion , it isn't .it will destroy their relationship if he doesn't respect his partner opinion and feelings as well.", "That was actually 3 years ago\u2026.", "No normal person would be THAT PISSED for YOU! it makes no sense, you wrote it. Just admit it", "You\u2019re making yourself look stupid right now to whoever that is\u2026", "YTA.", "Asking for someone else's opinion doesn't mean you don't respect your partner's opinion. OP didn't say that he'll do what her mom thinks regardless of what OP wants, OP just said that he asks for the mom's opinion for a variety of things.", "Sounds like a mother wound you need to address in therapy. I had a challenging relationship with mine too.", "Ah yes, I certainly care about your alter ego judging me.", "It does if you do it every time and without your partner's consent. It get tiresome really fast and it's the same 'momma s boy' s  case just instead of his own mother he s attached to op s mother.", "The examples that OP gave was not depicting it as \"every time\", but was regarding some serious decisions. Refinancing a house, what to do in an emergency medical situation, how to deal with preventative treatment for a young child. Its not like he's asking the mom where they should go out for dinner, these are real issues."]}
