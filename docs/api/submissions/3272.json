Probably not. This is not honoring anyone. YTA", "YTA. \n\n\"She begged not to\" yet you did it anyway. How do you even type that and not understand how inappropriate this was?", "YTA, normally you don\u2019t own a name, but this was a time when you really needed to respect your sister.  You loved and grieve your niece, but your sister lost a child.  I don\u2019t know if there is a more painful heartbreak. This is awful to her. At the least, you could have used it as a middle name instead. You think of it as celebrating her life, but your sister probably views it as her daughter being replaced or a painful reminder of her death. Unless you change her name, you most likely lost your relationship with your sister for good.", "Your sister's life burned down when her child died, and she lives every day in the ashes. You know that. You know it. You are a mother too, now, so you know what she lost. The scale of it. A whole lifetime of it. Every day waking up and realising, over again, that it isn't a dream. That her baby is gone. Will never finish school, or grow up, or have children of her own.\n\nI think that you haven't really accepted that grief. Her grief, or your own. You can't shoulder it. You can't climb out from under it. I think naming your own daughter this way was an attempt to write over it. To find a way to hear that name and not feel the pain. \n\nI get it. But it's not the right way to do this. You don't have the right to that name. It belongs to a dead child. Your own beloved niece, who you miss so much every day too. I think you need to work through your grief so you can find healthy ways to honor your niece that don't hurt the people around you.", "[removed]", "I know you lost your daughter, but isn\u2019t it more important that I like that name? \nI mean, your daughter is dead, mine will be alive.

You are feeling smug and superior because you claim your \u2018pure\u2019 motive was to celebrate your niece\u2019s life, and to hell with the feelings of the dead child\u2019s parent.", "It\u2019s selfish and kind of evil what you\u2019ve done YTA", "YTA. What else did you expect would happen? Have you no empathy? Your sister lost her child and you deliberately chose to hurt her. You\u2019re not just the AH, you\u2019re much much worse.", "My friend\u2019s daughter named her child after the baby\u2019s deceased uncle (my friends deceased son).

You were told how hard it would be for your sister and you decided it was a memorial? Good grief.", "YTA she repeatedly said no. Why are you now confused she's not talking to you?", "Stolen from a similar post a while ago:\n\nOK, your daughter was born in October and you love her. Think about watching her grow, and your love grows with her. You raise her as she starts pre-school, then regular school, and then middle school. You take care of her when she's sick, you comfort her when she's sad, and as she becomes a teenager you hold space for her during the emotional minefield that puberty brings. And you know that one day you'll get to see her become an adult, maybe have a family of her own. She's the thing you are most proud of in the whole world. \n\nThen she dies. \n\nYou bury her, you grieve not only for the loss of her but for the loss of her future that you had imagined. Maybe you figure out how to keep living your life, or maybe you just go through the motions because such a huge part of you has died with her.\n\nThen, a year or two or five later, a family member comes along with the exciting news that they are expecting a baby girl and they could not be more thrilled. It *does* turn the knife of your grief, but you also know that life goes on and you want them to be happy. Then they tell you that they are going to name their new baby the same name as your dead child. Every time you see that child, every milestone and accomplishment, you have to call them the name of your dead baby. \n\nNow, with that scenario, are you cool with it because \"they want to honor your daughter?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA! \n\nYou can honour your niece by using it as a middle name. \n\nMy son uses my cousin\u2019s name as a middle name as he died years before my son was born. My daughter died in 2006 and when my brother had his daughter in 2014 he used her name as a middle name. \n\nI would find family get togethers so hard if I had to hear her name being called and her not being there -in the family. \n\nI know I don\u2019t own the name Samantha and that there are 1000\u2019s of people worldwide with the same name, but within my family, especially a close one, would be so very very hard.", "YTA.\n\nYou are beyond cruel to your sister and the whole of your family. Anna died in 2021 and you think everyone will be happy for a new \u201dAnna\u201d. Your sister is still grieving, and everyone else too. And you makes it more painful by steeling Annas name for your daughter. Shame on you. This is not right for your daughter either, everyone will think of the first girl and be sad everytime you bring your daughter, your daughter will forever remind them of the first girl. And now the whole family will also remember how you steeling Annas name ruined your relationship with your sister.\n\nThere are some things you don\u2019t do, and this is one of them.\n\nYou can still heal the relationship to your sister by appologising and find a new name for your daughter.", "It is troll morning (well, morning where I am.)", "YTA, you're cruel and cold hearted, now your sister has a constant reminder of her loss and you've permanently damaged your relationship and your daughters relationship with your sister.

She may have been your niece but she wasn't your daughter.", "YTA I can't even imagine the entitlement!", "Wow!!!.. Heartless Ppl like you really exist?..\nYou're a Self Centered, Self Entitled Asshole. All you did was expose your deep rooted childhood hatred towards your sister so you mine as well update us on your childhood upbringing with her in an attempt to make this make sense... Smh..", "The moment you decided to proceed despite your sister\u2019s objections you became the AH.

My son died I would incandescent with rage if my siblings disrespected my wishes in the way you have. \n\nI would never speak to them again and would have nothing to do with their child. \n\nI can't believe how absolutely insensitive and disrespectful you have been to your sister and her child's memory.", "Huge YTA", ">I told my sister about it.

She begged not to, because she doesn't want to associate her name with someone else in the family.\n\nAfter this, do you seriously still need to ask? YTA", "YTA for all the reasons other people have said. Not only this but as your daughter gets older family and friends will associate that name with her more than your sister's child and you'll unintentionally be part of the reason people start to forget your niece. I'm in a family with a lot of generational names and all the stories get muddled between the various Robert's and John's.\n\nAlso, I want to add, I was named after my dad's first daughter who died as a toddler. It has affected the relationships I have with my siblings because they viewed it as me being the \"favourite\", and my dad has always been overprotective of me because of it. The trend repeated when my mum named her youngest after her grandmother and she is treated differently because of it.\n\nI desperately want to change my name because I feel like part of my identity has been swallowed up by the ghost of someone past but I know it would devastate my dad. Middle names I think sit better in memory of those past, it allows you to have a clear identity but a kind nod to the past.", "Info: what is wrong with you?", "YTA.\n\nShe was your neice, but HER child.\n\nWhen your child starts running round and to hear you calling her name? Addressing presents/cards to her? Hearing family talking about Anna, but not her Anna?\n\nIf you'd have said middle name, yes fair enough. That's  nice way to honour your neices memory, but first? This is ALL ABOUT YOU. Not your neice, and certainly not your sister.", "YTA in a big way. You thought your sister would love the idea of you running around after your kid calling her deceased child\u2019s name? Telling her about what \u201cAnna\u201d did today? Yikes. She suffered a horrendous loss and didn\u2019t feel the same way about this naming decision as you did. She told you how it would hurt her. You ignored her entirely. No wonder she\u2019s not speaking to you. I wouldn\u2019t either.\n\nNormally I\u2019m very \u201cyour kid, your choice\u201d\u2026but definitely not in this case.", "YTA are you fucking serious? Really? If it were your child that has died and you had to hear her name at every family gathering but *it's not her*. It's not her growing and changing. It's just a sad reminder of what you're missing, what your deceased child is missing. Salt in the wound every time you're around the family who is supposed to love, protect and support you.\n\nYou are a MASSIVE AH. I wouldn't blame her for never speaking to you again.", "Goodness, this is horrendous. Why ask her permission if you feel so entitled? \n\nYou are absolutely TA.", "YTA. There is absolutely no way you can possibly spin this where you are not the AH.", "Solid YTA. \n\nDo you care about other people than yourself? It sure doesn't seem like it.", "YTA.\n\nHer mother said no and it'd be too painful for her and you still went and named your kid after your niece. You can still change her name. If not enjoy being nc with your sister.", "I'm reading from this that your sister is Anna's mother, is that correct?\n\nIf so, you decided to deliberately trigger a grieving mother for the rest of her life against her express requests.\n\nYou can't claim to care about your sister after this. Your niece would be ashamed of you.\n\nYTA", "Wow. That's easily the most cruel and disrespectful thing you could have done to your sister. She lost her daughter. She told you it would hurt her, hearing her deceased child's name, and you just thought she'd eventually be okay with it?\n\nNot only did you just ruin your relationship with your sister, but you also ruined your daughter's chance at ever having a good relationship with her aunt. She will never be able to look at your daughter knowing that you have your 'Anna' and her Anna is no longer with her.\n\nI honestly don't know how you could ever reconcile with her. You asked her, she said how she felt, and you should have accepted it. You stepped all over her grief to make yourself happy. \n\nYTA.", "Wow so you could care less about how your sister feels. Don't expect her to ever come around. YTA", "YTA. I understand you want to celebrate your niece\u2019s life, but this move is interfering with your sister being able to grieve properly. I\u2019m sure your sister really would like to celebrate the birth of your child, but she can\u2019t do it properly because she will only be reminded of what she has lost. Perhaps \u201cAnna\u201d could be the child\u2019s middle name, or you could choose a name inspired by Anna, such as \u201cAnnabelle\u201d or \u201cSuzanne\u201d. Your sister would be able to use a nickname like \u201cBelle\u201d or \u201cSuzy\u201d in order to not connect your daughter with her own daughter\u2019s death.", "YTA. What you have done is practically erased that young girls existence by naming your child the same name. Anyone who brings up your sisters Anna, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s about your daughter. You\u2019ve told your sister that her child that passed has been replaced. You\u2019re an awful person for doing that. It will hurt your sister greatly by doing that, every time she hears Anna, she\u2019ll feel the pain over and over again", "Wow\u2026YTA. Why would you think that\u2019s ok? You\u2019re replacing her daughter with yours. Also it\u2019s painful for her to hear the name.\n\nAlso it\u2019s likely your daughter will also hate this once she\u2019s old enough to know", "YTA-I\u2019m usually quick to point out no one owns a name but what you\u2019ve done is unbelievably selfish, crass  and cruel.", "Yeah YTA. Your relationship with your niece was very special and it\u2019s absolutely devastating that she passed away so young. However, you should have tried to at least put yourself in your sister\u2019s shoes, as you now have a daughter, too. Perhaps you would\u2019ve found it to be a very sweet gesture if the roles were reversed, but your sister as you stated \u201cbegged\u201d you not to, and you went against her wishes. Why couldn\u2019t your nieces name be incorporated in you daughter\u2019s name? I know the name \u201cAnna\u201d is not the real name but if it was, for example maybe a middle name? Or naming your daughter something like Julianna, Lillianna, etc. Your sister most likely does not want her daughter to be replaced. A name is more than just that- it\u2019s your identity. By naming your daughter after her, you\u2019re taking away her individuality in your sister\u2019s eyes.", "Huge, major and complete YTA. Who tf would actually do this. Your poor sister!", "A hundred years ago this would have been a non issue- my great grandmother shared a first name with her youngest sister, once she married/moved out they just used her name again for the next baby. \nBut things have changed. You may have had good intentions, but in asking your sibling and then ignoring her no, YTA.  As others have pointed out, you could have used it as a middle name, which is the generally accepted location of a family name honouring someone not the parent or grandparent who has passed. Instead you have doomed your child to a lifetime of being compared to the original Anna, and not seen as their own person by any of the people who knew your sisters child. Which is pretty much everyone in your family. \nIt\u2019s not too late to change it, or to start referring to your child as their middle name, or both names (like Anna Maria or Mary Jo) to differentiate. I doubt your sister will forgive no matter what you do at this point though, so your kid is down an aunt which is too bad.", "YTA, your sister told you it was too painful for her! Your sister had to bury her child! That is something someone never gets over! She begged you not to do it, and you did it anyway.", "I\u2019m gonna go NTA. Just because y\u2019all should have talked it out and Anna is such a common name. There is no reason wanting to honor someone\u2019s life should cause a split.", "YTA\n\nEspecially because you told your sister your plan, she expressed how it would make her feel and yet you still decided to name her \u201cAnna\u201d.", "You\u2019re beyond assholery you\u2019re are so heartless\u2026\nI can imagine the pain of your sister.\n\nMassive YTA", "YTA. Your sister told you no. That should have been the end of it", "You\u2019re vile and disgusting.

This is why we have middle names, so you can have the memorial name somewhere where it doesn't get yelled across the Thanksgiving table and traumatize your sister.

And you\u2019re still expecting your sister to be happy about what you did, and to come see Anna? Start accepting that you\u2019ve messed up and your daughter will never meet her aunt and even have a relationship with her. You may even get sidelined from family events because Anna\u2019s presence will only be a painful reminder to your sister. Do the honorable thing. Change her name. That\u2019s the only way you can honor your niece.", "YTA. There are so many names available\u2026why choose the one that causes your sister pain?", "Yeah if she asked you not to and was clear about her reasons, you\u2019re the asshole", "You could celebrate somebody else's life. One who wouldn't cause pain to your sister whenever she hears it. \n\nMild YTA and also insensitive.", "Middle name is tribute, first name is cruel after you were asked not to YTA massively, yes Anna was your niece but she was your sisters child I repeat YTA", "Of course YTA. Your niece passed away tragically young and that's something a mother never gets over. Naming your daughter after her isnt memorializing your niece, it's driving a knife into your sister's heart every time she hears her daughters name reused.

This is heartless and cruel.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s impossible for me to even\u2026wrap my head around your callous selfishness.\n\nChange the baby\u2019s name. \n\nThis is so awful.", "YTA!!!! Hard YTA! You asked and she begged you not to do it and you selfishly did it anyway. I hope the name was worth losing a sister.", "Your sister went through something no parent should ever have to go through. While other members of your family, yourself included, may have grieved the loss of this child, I guarantee you, nobody, absolutely nobody felt more pain than her parents.

Her birth will forever be associated with this conflict, and your daughters relationship with her aunt will forever be tainted", "So it is true. Common sense is not so common. Common sense of hurting others and humiliating yourself in front of the community by asking such stupid questions. Next level of hurt you've caused your sister, OP. I hope your daughter gets someone sensible to raise her.\n\nPS: you're a major AH with no sense of peoples' hurt.", "YTA and honestly how dare you. You really asked your sister just to say you did and not because you cared about her feelings. Good luck with that. I can\u2019t stand people who are this selfish. She lost her daughter. You have zero idea what that is like and you decided to honor her when no one asked for that. \n\nHonestly what I want to say would catch me a ban", "Probably won\u2019t see this comment, but your baby is just over a month old and a name change is still possible.\n\nApologize to your sister in law and let her know how much your niece meant to you. Apologize for not understanding how people grieve in different ways and let her know you will be changing her name. Don\u2019t expect immediate forgiveness but let her know you\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s right. Eventually she will come around, but make amends by selecting a different name ASAP and apologizing.", "Yes!! YTA", "YTA\n\nYOU lost your neice... YOU think it's an honor.....YOU want to call your daughter by her dead daughter's name...YOU asked her input, then ignored her pain...\n\nYou made the loss of her daughter all about YOU.", "YTA. Yes, Anna may have been a lot of things to a lot of people, but the relationship of daughter supersedes all of those. So stop with the \u201cbut she was also a niece, a granddaughter, etc\u201d BS. It honestly makes you look even worse. There is no justification for why you didn\u2019t take your sister\u2019s feelings into account. You probably ruined your relationship with your sister, and the relationship between your daughter and her aunt. All because you selfishly couldn\u2019t pick another name out of thousands and thousands of possibilities.", "I normally don't respond to these AITA questions cuz I always think someone else will do a better way at explaining this but I will make an exception for this one. Not cuz I think I can voice it in a profound way but because you need to realise OP how much this makes YTA and need to have as many people as possible tell you that.\n\nThe fact you say you told your sister, not you asked her for permission shows how insensitive you're being towards her feelings about the name, her grief for he dead child and now the pain you will cause her everytime your daughter gets brought up.\n\nNot only did you ruin your relationship with your sister maybe irreparable but you also fucked over your own daughter in the process and might've cost your daughter and sister to have a great aunt-niece relationship.\n\nSo if it wasn't clear from the 3 paragraphs, OP you are very much the asshole.", "I'm sure OP wouldn't like it one bit if they were in their sister's shoes.

If you wanted to honour your niece you could have gave her Anna as a middle name maybe instead.", "YTA cause that's just selfish and insensitive. Yes she was your niece and family, but was your sister's daughter! That's way more of a big deal. Imagine the pain of loosing a child, she is probably still grieving and you are already using the same name of her daughter, with your child.", "YTA.

YTA a thousand times over.", "I\u2019ll add \u2014 change Anna to her middle name if you want to honor your niece\u2019s life without punishing your sister every time.", "Simple and to the point, I like this! I don\u2019t think there needs to be any explanation besides \u201cYTA\u201d for this. It should be common sense to OP that what she did was wrong.", "If the mother or father of the deceased asked the new parents not to though, would they still use the name?", "That\u2019s fine for your family but OP\u2019s sister does not have this kind of tradition and OP should have respected this. OP is definitely YTA", "You are getting 100\u2019s of YTA\u2019s and you still think you\u2019re right? Wow", "Do you honestly think your sister was ever going to forget her daughter? YTA, you should have respected your sister\u2019s (the MOTHER\u2019S) wishes. She literally begged you not to do this, how callous of you.", "And who arrogant of you 'we are not forgetting Anna'. Her daughter died. She will spend every single day of the rest of her life painfully aware her child is dead and will never forget her.", "You also have put the burden of naming her the same name on your daughter like the replacement for the grandchild who died. \nIf your niece had not died you wouldn't have considered using her name for a second. You have been so disrespectful of your sister and her daughter. \n\nIt is all types of messed up. \n\nChange her first name and keep it as a second name if you want to 'honour'", "I don\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t honour the wishes of the parent \u201cwhere the name came from\u201d. At what point did you think, your wishes mattered more than her\u2019s in this regard? I mean why go asking her for permission if you thought it was okay to be only your decisions anyways. Honouring deceased relatives, especially those who have passed young, by naming others in the family after them is a sweet gesture but only when some time has passed and the impacted party gives you their blessings. I don\u2019t understand how or why you refuse to understand that. YTA", "There are plenty of other ways to celebrate Anna's life and keep her memory that won't include traumatising your sister who recently lost her daughter.", "Your poor daughter. She will forever be tied to her cousin in a way that hurts her relationship with her family.  Her aunt will not be in her life because of your choice.   A meaningful relationship with her aunt would have been worth a lot more to your daughter than knowing her name is a tribute to somebody she\u2019ll never meet.  \n\nYou may be honoring the dead but your hurting your living family.", "And yet your choices mean your daughter will never know her aunt.\n\nWill you include that as part of the story of her name? And how is you telling her better than her having a relationship with her aunt, the person who knew her best and loved her most?", "I mean she told you not to so don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a tribute to her dead daughter. You did it against the wishes of the parents, so it\u2019s not in honor. It\u2019s because you selfishly liked the name", "This is cruel to everyone involved. Your daughter now lives in the shadow of someone else, and your sister will be constantly reminded. If you wanted to honor Anna, a middle name would've been a way better choice.", "Will you also explain that her name is the reason your sister doesnt talk to you or want to meet her? Cause that's a fucked horrible thing you did that now your child is gonna have to deal with", "No. It\u2019s your way of saying - gee, my sister got way too much attention when her daughter died. Let\u2019s bring the focus back to me!", "YTA:\n\nAnna: Who was Anna? \n\nOP: Aunt Becky\u2019s daughter who died at 14. \n\nAnna: Who is Aunt Becky?", "My heart is breaking for your sister. YTA", "Why? Don\u2019t want people to see how much of an Ah you truly are?", "That's so recent! Her mother is still grieving and this is how you treat her? That's so incredibly disrespectful of you. YTA.", "You're a foul woman.", "I\u2019m sorry but this makes it worse, you don\u2019t care about your sister or her daughter\u2019s memory. Legit a year ago and you think it\u2019s okay to do that? I hope this post brings you some clarity but if not I hope your sister does so well for her self keep toxic people like you away.", "It's only been one year?! Wow YTA.", "You are not honouring her by hurting her mother and you are giving your daughter a legacy of harm and family strife for no reason", "It probably hasn't been a year yet and you are digging your hand into an open wound. That's cruel. \n\nYou didn't do this to celebrate Anna's life, there are plenty of other ways to do so. You just did it because you wanted to feel better about yourself and that's horrible. \n\nCongratulations, you showed your sister how little you care about her and her grief. Yes, it was also part of your family but it was her daughter. No one will grieve and suffer the way she is doing, a mother isn't supposed to see their daughter die it's the other way around. \n\nYTA and a cruel one.", "Unbelievable. Anna passed a year ago, her mother asked you not to, and you still chose to name your child Anna\u2026 i wouldn\u2019t speak to you either. Awful", "So it\u2019s also only been a year. Wow with every comment I feel sorry for your sister and for your daughter to have you for a mother.", "THAT\u2019S SO RECENT HOLY HELL?? Yeah you\u2019re a major asshole for that.", "You lost your niece in 2021 and your sister in 2022. Well played. YTA.", "You're a monster.", "That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing using her name. Your poor sister, every time she hears her name - the pain that would bring. \nYour more than an asshole to do that to her \n\nAnd to do that to your daughter. Starting off as one of the worst mothers ever.", "Then why the fuck are you bringing a new Anna to this world to rub into your sisters face after she said NOT to? You are not honoring her daughter-- you are disrespecting her.", "What you should have done was made the name a middle name. That way you have honored your niece, but your sister doesn't hear the name all the time. It was very insensitive of you to go against your sister's wishes. How long has your niece been deceased? \n\nYTA", "Yeah, that would make sense.", "I don\u2019t see where she said it was within a year. And I didn\u2019t call anyone the asshole.", "You're going to make your daughter forever live in the shadow of a ghost.  It will always be what could've been. \nDaughter is 1 month old and already she has a part of her family resent her. YTA. For being selfish and for being insensitive to a mother's pain. Fix yourself before motherhood becomes a chore for you.", "I obviously missed it or I wouldn\u2019t have asked an innocent question. YTA", "Thank you", "Thanks.", "I understand but I think OP's reason is to honor the niece which means that she loved her and that she doesn't want her to be forgotten. For that reason alone, I'll give her my MILD.", "Dumb on top of heartless.", "You asked her. She answered you. No, she begged you and you completely disregarded her.  YTA totally 100%. I can\u2019t get over how selfish you are.", "No your wrong. Imagine your child do you think anyone loves her as much as you. How would you feel if she died and someone used the name when you said no.", "Ok but nobody's pain matches that of a parent whose child died. You asked, she told you it would cause her great pain, you did it anyway. It was wrong to do it, and it was wrong to think she would eventually get used to it. \n\nIt's not too late to change your daughter's name. Make it Annabelle or Annalise or switch Anna to this middle name.", "I\u2019m sorry but that is a very bad excuse, yes she was all that to your family but she was not YOUR daughter. To lose a child that you took the time in choosing the name, plus carrying and raising for 14 years. Then to be ripped away from you at such a young age is one of the hardest things to go through. Yes you mourned but it is nothing like that of a parent. Also info how long ago did she pass away? \nI hope it wasn\u2019t within the past 5-10 year or even a year to two because that is like putting salt in a wound. You will lose your sister over this and she has every right to never speak to you again. Think of it like this the one person who should be having her back and helping her is the one giving her the most pain. She might come around a couple years from now but don\u2019t expect her to be all happy rainbows and butterflies.\n\nEdit: OP confirmed it was last year her sister lost her daughter. YTA big time", "She was your sister's daughter first and foremost. \n\nHuge YTA.", "This is incredibly insensitive. You've damaged your relationship with your sister and also potentially your daughter's relationship with her aunt because you choose to ignore people's feelings. YTA. Change the name.", "Imagine your sister naming a son specifically because she liked an ex of yours who was abusive to you. You would be here calling her insensitive and how much memories it brought back. Out of the entire universe of names\u2026.you chose this!", "So if your daughter dies then you\u2019ll be okay with everyone saying that to you huh? Or are you that vile of a human being. I dare you to say that to her face", "YTA no matter how your brain try\u2019s to spin it! It was your sister\u2019s daughter and she said no. You think it\u2019s an honor, but your sister probably thinks of it as you trying to replace her child. This was wrong on sooo many levels. I don\u2019t think your sister will forgive you any time soon.", "You need to change your daughters name. Because I promise you that your daughter will have little to no relationship with your family if you keep insisting on being this spiteful.", "She was all those things, but her memory isn\u2019t honored if how you honor her hurts the people she loved most.", "Her daughter was more important to her than she was to you because SHE WAS HER DAUGHTER. You are so selfish and heartless! I feel sorry for your child to be stuck with an asshole like you.", "Wow\u2026 I have no words for how entitled you are.", "Uhh yeah she was all of those things but did you go around asking for \u201cpermission\u201d from all the cousins, grandparents, uncles and aunts. No, right? At best, you probably threw around the idea with some of them (I hope?) but you knew you had to ask the mom. Why? You understand what\u2019s wrong here and yet you act as if you don\u2019t.", "Very wrong and you knew it. You just needed to have your way, forget everyone else. You\u2019re an AH.", "God. She was primarily your sister\u2019s daughter. Take whatever sense of loss you felt when Anna died & multiply it beyond infinity, and you\u2019ll get close to your sister\u2019s feelings of loss.\n\nNaming your daughter your dead niece\u2019s name was profoundly cruel and grossly selfish.", "You are downright CRUEL, self absorbed, and heartless. I would go totally NC with you and I am not someone who really believes in that sort of reaction to family. But this story has me totally rethinking my philosophy on that because this is beyond the pale.", "I mean, technically you can name your daughter whatever you want but it should have been obvious you would lose your sister with this name. If I were her I would definitely refuse to ever meet my niece.", "You've robbed yourself of a sister and you've robbed your daughter of an aunt with your selfishness.", "> But I was wrong.\n\nWe all got that. So what's your plan now? Change name? Or unsuccessfully waiting for sister to change her mind? Because you have a clear choice - a life where your daughter can have an aunt and one where your daughter doesn't have an aunt and you, a sister.\n\nIf the overwhelming YTA judgements you got indeed made any impact on you, please do the decent thing and dont implode your family.", "You are an awful human being. I lost a son and if anyone ever did this I would never speak to them again.", "How much time do you think it will take for your daughter to get used to having a profoundly narcissistic and unempathetic mother? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve proven you are. Deciding your method of honor is more important than her own mother\u2019s method of grieving is centering yourself in the conversation when you aren\u2019t in the center of grief. I hope you\u2019re putting money away for Anna\u2019s therapy, because she\u2019s going to have a lot to recover from after a lifetime with you.", "That is literally the worlds crappiest response. No matter how long the time she will always grieve her child.  You are the worst.", "How dense can you honestly be this poor mother is grieving and you won\u2019t listen to anyone. Why even come here to ask if you didn\u2019t want a real verdict? That\u2019s the point of this sub so take the L and switch the first and middle name.", "You stated her daughter passed and what you are doing is vial.", "If she doesn\u2019t?   You\u2019ve lost a sister too.", "I think she not getting used to it and going NC with you and your baby is a real possibility. So, think about that. YTA btw.", "I initially intended on suggesting you change the baby's name to her middle name and honor your niece that way.  But, this comment shows your true intent, which is not to honor your niece, but to do what YOU want, no matter what. \n\nIs naming your child Anna worth losing your sister over?  And when Anna grows up and she finds out the real story, not just your version, how do you think that is going to go over?\n\nYTA big time", "No. It\u2019s time for you to change the baby\u2019s name.", "My dad was named after a dead close relative who had died young. He\u2019s 78. He STILL hates it", "Please think  about what you keep repeating: you are saying you would rather risk losing your sister, the strongest connection to your niece, then consider you were wrong. You are okay waiting for your sister to come around.\n\nDo you understand the message you give when you say that?\n\nYou are banking on your sister loving you more than you love her.", "I can completely understand the tradition if it is already established, it sounds a nice way to honor the past loved ones if all are on board with it", "All I can assume is this new account is yet another troll. There is no way my brain can understand the level of asshole OP is if any of this is true.", "Well I got pregnant soon after my niece passed away... I thought it was the perfect name.", "N T A ruling means the other person in the story is an AH. If you don\u2019t think there are any assholes in the story, the appropriate ruling is N A H. That\u2019s why the other commenter thought you were saying sister was the AH.", "WRONG", "OP says in another comment that Anna passed in 2021. Heartless.", "The girl died in 2021\u2026see comments above. It is so cruel.", "Same. If my any of siblings did this I would never speak or lay eyes on them again.", "Wtf? Why not as a middle name? That would honor her and not shove the very recent death of your niece in everyone\u2019s faces! Good lord you are heartless and cruel.", "Wow. So your sister is also still very deep in her grief and you throw this name in her face. You're an AH and a B and a C. You're a trash human and honeslty, your daughter is going to hate the story behind her name", "This makes you even a bigger AH. She is still grieving, the loss is too recent and too painful. \n\nNot that being after a few years would make it ok, just that it makes it even worse.", "You only thought about what you wanted. You ignored your sister's wishes and feelings , and decided only your wishes and feelings mattered. You essentially hijacked your niece's memory from her mother. YTA, completely.", "Are you 12?", "Sorry, you were wrong. YTA.", "God, even the thought makes me itch a bit. Like how can anyone be this heartless to their grieving sibling?!", "A middle name as a way to honour her, I could get behind. It\u2019s understated and not in your face, fronting her own kid as the \u201eAnna that\u2019s alive\u201c", "Exactly! If this was about honoring her niece she would have gone that route, or used her niece\u2019s middle name, etc. Something that connects them but doesn\u2019t cruelly shove the reminder of her death in everyone\u2019s face."]}
