Now! because it's my house.' I was literally in shock and didn't know what to do so I went to go look and I saw the period pad in the bin. I wasn't on my period and I don't use pads either, so I grabbed the bin and took it to show BIL and asked if that was what he meant.

The Period of itself is not something to be shamed. Its part of life as a woman in child years.

And here we are . Well well well.\n\nThird, you can use this situation to identify future people who will have a problem with this situation. The one Person having the Period if known to you needs to understand the first thing about Periods and nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nThe rest of the people in that group will not be taught anything. They are set in their ways and thus you have chaos.\n\n4th... I dont do a damn thing inside anyone else house. Its not mine to do. Its their home, their problem. Now.. that eventually circles back to the girl who left the pad there with the period material that needs cleaning. She should know better.\n\nMaybe she does now in the future bring the necessary things to make sure that kind of disposal is not a problem and the clean up without fuss.\n\nThe last thought is for those who never had been around Periods and need to understand its a form of biohazard and needs cleaning up properly when someone has it inside a space like a bathroom.

You have strangers on the internet more upset on your behalf than your 'mutual friends.' They don't want to hear about it because it's inconvenient for them, or they'd be more concerned with your husband's acquiescence with his family's racism than with 'fairness' to your husband.", "Me too. ALL the things said. You can do better than a husband who doesn\u2019t care enough to stand up for you and in-laws that are openly racist and go out of their way to embarrass you. \n\nNTA", "> They don't want to hear about it because it's inconvenient for them, \n\nOr - and a hot take here - talking about it exposes the same problems they have with their husbands that they're too scared to do anything about."]}
