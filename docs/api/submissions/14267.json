I'm assuming the use for \"alimony\" is parental support and not spousal support after a divorce. In which case, it's unfortunate but I do believe there are laws in China that dictate children must support their parents since I read that generally, there is no such thing as retirement plans there. \n\n It was cultural for boys/men to be favored to be born over girl because they would pass on the family name and their wife would be the one to stay home and help take care of his parents which is why the one child policy changed to the two child policy as the ratio of boys/girls became out of wack. \n\nI don't know how the alimony would work if said child is in college and therefore has no (I'm assuming) income.", "I am just as lost.", "This is definitely a language barrier.

While most filial responsibility laws contemplate civil enforcement, some include criminal penalties for adult children or close relatives who fail to provide for family members when challenged to do so. \" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial\\_responsibility\\_laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_responsibility_laws)\n\nOn the one hand, children should take care of parents out of love; on the other hand, offspring should not be responsible for abusive or neglectful parents.", "I\u2019ve just never heard of anyone in the US being court ordered to look after a parent or put in jail for not doing so.
