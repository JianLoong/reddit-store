My partner\u2019s states he needs sleep so he doesn\u2019t have an accident working. I had myself and son being sick, our baby daughter screaming because she\u2019s seen me throw up in the sink whilst holding her due to clinginess. My son and I took turns using the toilet, my son threw up on his bed and on the landing, I was struggling with my own sickness, our baby daughter\u2019s clinginess and screaming, and trying to sort out my son\u2019s sickness.\n\nI went to my partner with our baby daughter in my arms screaming, explained that I need help as me and my son are being sick and struggling.\n\nMy partner asked me what do I want his help with. Told him that I would like help sorting out my son\u2019s bed. My partner ended up taken our daughter downstairs as I\u2019ve been sick again.\n\nI hear our baby daughter screaming downstairs so once sorted I\u2019ve rushed back to her. My partner made a comment that apparently I\u2019ve given everyone food poisoning (the night our baby daughter started being sick he was away at a hotel and is blaming me for the situation, I hadn\u2019t cooked for the family that night, instead I ordered a KFC for the family, so can\u2019t imagine how I could\u2019ve given everyone food poisoning, the next day I got in touch with the doctors regarding our baby daughter as I was concerned with the amount of vomiting and was informed that she had caught a nasty tummy bug that was going round at the moment. My partner was gone til 6pm and I hadn\u2019t pestered him with our baby daughter\u2019s sickness and dealt with it myself as I was giving him his space) naturally snapped at the comment and felt asking for his help had been a mistake. I ended up clearing the sick on the landing and had to get my son to sort out his own bed.\n\nAfter finishing I took our daughter back and my partner went to go back to bed. I did make the comment that I was sorry for waking him up and felt he didn\u2019t care to help when it involved me or my son.\n\nLater on in the night I was sick again and our baby daughter started screaming again. I had her on my lap as I still couldn\u2019t put her down and she was refusing to sleep. This time my partner came down taking our baby daughter downstairs as I was still being sick in the sink.\n\nI finished sorting myself out again and ensured my son was alright. His bedding situation was sorted and he was finally able to get some sleep.\n\nDownstairs, our baby\u2019s daughter was going back and forth between me and my partner but refusing to sleep and struggled to settle.\n\nMy partner ended up sleeping on the sofa and I ended up sat up on the sofa focusing on our baby daughter the rest of the night, got her to sleep but if I moved she would cry and wake. My partner ended up waking and getting ready for work after a few hours. I said thank you for helping and good luck with work but he brushed off my words as in a mood with me.\n\nBut was I the one being out of order?", "created_utc": 1702133078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ef18h/aita_for_wanting_my_partner_to_help_in_the_middle/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anything else is Selfish Man Thinks A Wife is Maid, Babysitter and On-Demand Booty Call.", "He\u2019s a big fat jerk and a poor excuse for a dad and a partner. It\u2019s one thing to grant him some consideration on a regular night. But if you guys are sick and struggling, he needs to help. I say this as a surgeon \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine not getting up to help my partner and every single colleague I know would do the same. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and I promise he can survive with one night of disrupted sleep.", "You were throwing up, and your kids were throwing up and the other adult in the house wanted nothing to do with it.  Instead of helping, he blamed you for making the children sick.\n\nIt's not you.  It's him.", "He. Let. His. Young. Son. Clean. His. Own. Bedding. While. Violently. ill.", "ITS NOT HELPING \n\nIT IS NOT YOUR JOB, HE IS NOT HELPING", "Does he not have any sick leave? I know it's the busy time of year, but if the whole house is sick, he should be calling in. He should not be blaming you, or demanding sleep. If he wants you healthy enough to take care of the kids alone, he needs to take over and let you rest.", "My husband works as a manager for a major airline. If he messes up it is major. He is up at 4am. \n\nHe would never have behaved this way.", "I doubt it was the KFC anyway...Right now norovirus and rotovirus are going around. Super contagious.", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. He doesn\u2019t seem like a good fit for fatherhood. If you can\u2019t make it financially on your own, just be realistic that you\u2019re really a single parent and keep that truth in front of you. Good luck! You seem like a strong woman.", "Leave. As soon as you can.", "Oh he realizes she will want him to- and he realizes he can constantly cite \u201cbeing a postieee who needs his sleeeeep\u201d as the reason he won\u2019t.", "He is an AH in that situation, everybody is sick besides him, his attitude sucked\u2026 English isn\u2019t my primary language so I had trouble understanding but did he ended up helping in the end? \n\nThat being said he is the sole breadwinner, she is a SAHM. If he does most of the cooking, laundry and some other stuff, then it pretty much balanced itself out in terms of house chores. He might even be doing more than her because planning meals/cooking and laundry are a big chunk of chores.\n\nOP didn\u2019t mention anything about how much time he spends with his kids. So can\u2019t say anything about that.", "I looked up what a postie is, and all that came up was a postal carrier. I'm not convinced that's correct, because I can't understand why that career would grant him extra priority on sleep. I mean, we're talking about delivering letters, right? My uncle was a mailman for forty years; he liked that he got to walk so much and that he didn't have to work in an office. OP's husband is not using dangerous machinery, or defusing bombs, or operating on people, or working in hazardous conditions. He's delivering letters, not directing air traffic. I get his job will be more stressful around the holidays, and it comes with a generally demanding workload with tight deadlines. But OP is talking as if hubby is fighting in the trenches. Dude needs to take a 5 hour energy and be part of his family.", "Driving tired is just as dangerous as driving drunk. He should he helping more but acting like mailmen just skip down the road delivering letters is disingenuous"]}
