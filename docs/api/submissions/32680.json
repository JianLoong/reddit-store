My partner\u2019s states he needs sleep so he doesn\u2019t have an accident working. I had myself and son being sick, our baby daughter screaming because she\u2019s seen me throw up in the sink whilst holding her due to clinginess. My son and I took turns using the toilet, my son threw up on his bed and on the landing, I was struggling with my own sickness, our baby daughter\u2019s clinginess and screaming, and trying to sort out my son\u2019s sickness.\n\nI went to my partner with our baby daughter in my arms screaming, explained that I need help as me and my son are being sick and struggling.\n\nMy partner asked me what do I want his help with. Told him that I would like help sorting out my son\u2019s bed. My partner ended up taken our daughter downstairs as I\u2019ve been sick again.\n\nI hear our baby daughter screaming downstairs so once sorted I\u2019ve rushed back to her. My partner made a comment that apparently I\u2019ve given everyone food poisoning (the night our baby daughter started being sick he was away at a hotel and is blaming me for the situation, I hadn\u2019t cooked for the family that night, instead I ordered a KFC for the family, so can\u2019t imagine how I could\u2019ve given everyone food poisoning, the next day I got in touch with the doctors regarding our baby daughter as I was concerned with the amount of vomiting and was informed that she had caught a nasty tummy bug that was going round at the moment. My partner was gone til 6pm and I hadn\u2019t pestered him with our baby daughter\u2019s sickness and dealt with it myself as I was giving him his space) naturally snapped at the comment and felt asking for his help had been a mistake. I ended up clearing the sick on the landing and had to get my son to sort out his own bed.\n\nAfter finishing I took our daughter back and my partner went to go back to bed. I did make the comment that I was sorry for waking him up and felt he didn\u2019t care to help when it involved me or my son.\n\nLater on in the night I was sick again and our baby daughter started screaming again. I had her on my lap as I still couldn\u2019t put her down and she was refusing to sleep. This time my partner came down taking our baby daughter downstairs as I was still being sick in the sink.\n\nI finished sorting myself out again and ensured my son was alright. His bedding situation was sorted and he was finally able to get some sleep.\n\nDownstairs, our baby\u2019s daughter was going back and forth between me and my partner but refusing to sleep and struggled to settle.\n\nMy partner ended up sleeping on the sofa and I ended up sat up on the sofa focusing on our baby daughter the rest of the night, got her to sleep but if I moved she would cry and wake. My partner ended up waking and getting ready for work after a few hours. I said thank you for helping and good luck with work but he brushed off my words as in a mood with me.\n\nBut was I the one being out of order?", "created_utc": 1702133078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ef18h/aita_for_wanting_my_partner_to_help_in_the_middle/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter screaming is not an excuse to run downstairs. Let him figure it out with her while you focus on you and your son. He took her downstairs and that WAS helping. Every time you vomitted while holding her it riled her back up. Had you simply let him take her, despite the screaming, she would have settled down.\n\nI'm a Mom.

Work or no work, if he\u2019s the only one not sick, he SHOULD take care of everyone, both kids and you! If that means he has to take one or multiple days off work, so be it. We\u2019ve had situations where, before our 3rd was born, all 4 of us had a stomach bug, or, after she was born, all 5 of us were sick, and in those cases, the parent who was the least sick, was taking care of everyone.\n\nOh, I remember those days, with my husband holding a sick bag behind the baby\u2019s back for me, so I could throw up while breastfeeding. \ud83d\ude31 Or me fainting in the corridor while on my way back from the bathroom, and waking up on the floor 2 hours later, deep joy\u2026 out of my mind with worry for the kids\u2026 I\u2019m so glad those days are over! Never in my life have I had so many stomach bugs as during the first years after my eldest started school (at age 2,5 in my country).\n\nI feel for you, hang in there!

The other takes over. He can have a coffee before work, he\u2019s fine. He did the absolute bare minimum.", "NTA and if anything you are doing a disservice to yourself and your kids by letting him get away with this. \nAn example of a good partner - I had a similar stomach bug, coming out both ends whilst trying to look after my then 8mo daughter. I tried to do what I could but I realised that there was no way I could manage on my own so called my husband. He went straight to his boss and told them that he was going home to look after his wife & child. He got in the car and drove the 50min home, walked in and got the baby settled. He also cleaned up the bodily fluids (I don\u2019t want to paint too much of a picture here) and sent me straight up to bed. \nHe got me water, rehydration drinks, etc whilst looking after our daughter.\nAnd the only thing he said as I sobbed and blubbered how sorry I was he was dealing with this\u2026 \u201coh hunni it\u2019s not your fault.

I don\u2019t expect my partner to be 100% perfect. I don\u2019t mean to make it seem like he does nothing for the family. He works hard, even if he gets ill he\u2019ll still do his best to go into work to financially help the family.

I'm going nta but something feels off about this whole situation", "Rich coming from a dude who can't mind HIS own business, think I'll ignore your opinion, thanks \ud83e\udd23", "Maybe the fact that the only healthy person got grumpy when asked to care for a baby while the sick adult was throwing up and cleaning up another person\u2019s vomit? Could that be the thing that feels off, that the only healthy person was acting rude when their help was needed? Or is the thing that you think is \u201coff\u201d the fact that OP needed help while she was sick in the first place?", "Good. Ignore me please. That would make me happy.", "I'm very much not on husband's side. To the point that thanking him at all seems to me strange, which is why I was wondering if it was genuine or not. I.e is op so used to him being completely useless that it was a genuine thanks, does op have something going on that predisposed her to saying thank you just to keep the peace, or was op using a sarcastic thanks as poor communication of her reasonable dissatisfaction? Genuinely saying thank you in that situation is what seems off to me and speaks to other major issues that would certainly impact this situation. \n\nIn the end he was absolutely contributing to his own sleeplessness, it would have been much faster to just get up and help properly, not to mention that's just the right thing to do"]}
