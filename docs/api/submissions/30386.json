Mary set up a separate chat with just the 2 of us and she shared stuff and asks questions there regularly throughout the day \n\nThis morning we compared braxton hicks experiences", "Agreed. The host is trying to stir up drama and move up on the friend list.", "Set it up to exclude her or of jealousy", "C\u2019mon, it\u2019s totally reasonable to ask someone to CHANGE THEIR FLIGHT or SKIP WORK to attend a *baby shower.* Psycho is right.", "This is the most accurate statement", ">idk what her deal is\n\nOP is the only mom in the group so Shelley is definitely angling to burn the bridge and ruin OPs relationship with the friend in common. All the fake outrageous solutions Shelley is offering about abandoning her parents or own child are so she can have a clear conscience when she goes to tell the other friend that \"I even tried so hard to convince OP to come and offered a bunch of solutions to her objections but it's almost like she was *trying* to make a point about not supporting you...\"\n\nShelley is trying to make OP look like a selfish one-way friend to open up the special avenue OP has being the only other mom by Shelley becoming the friend who was \"there for her\" when other people disappointed. The relationship between OP and the new mom is obviously close if she's texting just her outside of the group chats that include Shelley and Shelley can't stand it.", "Yeah I totally understand if that\u2019s the most convenient time for the other people it\u2019s fine! It\u2019s just not possible for me!", "You'd be surprised. One of my SILs is giving me the silent treatment over me not responding to her messages right away (and subsequently leaving our group chat) because my child wiped out and needed me. \n\nNTA OP. Some people just can't be reasoned with.", "Yeah after the shower (you don't want to spoil any surprises and accidentally become an ahole) I'd explain to Mary. Depending on whether she seems upset with OP and whether she believes her I'd keep it at casual check in up to showing her screenshot evidence (take screenshots now in case it's e.g. WhatsApp and she deletes for all or edits or something)", "Lol at summons.", "OP didn't try to make the baby shower revolve around schedule. Husband had work, no babysitter, parents needed a ride to the airport. She simply explained why she couldn't make it. She didn't say \"can you accommodate my schedule?\"", "lmao you blatantly didn\u2019t read my post\n\nif she wants me there she can include a time I can make it. I had no problem not going.\n\nShe\u2019s the one insisting I go.\n\nShould I leave my 1yo home alone? Just give him a juice box and some cartoons maybe?\n\nAnd a 90 minute drive to a max 90 minute brunch is a fucking long drive even if I did have childcare which I don\u2019t!", "How is politely saying you can't attend the same as \"revolving it around your schedule\" in your mind? No really I would like to understand how your brain functions with that level of mental gymnastics. Is it because OP explained WHY she couldn't attend? Is that the part that makes it all about her?\n\nAre we also ignoring the fact that none of this was actually planned by the expecting mother but by a 'friend' and OP is still keeping in contact with the actual expecting mother and on good terms?\n\nIf your friends are planning an event and asked everyone for the times they're available and you made it clear in no uncertain language that you absolutely can't make it on a certain day then the event is still scheduled for that day then are you the asshole for not attending?", "Found Shelly.", "It seems to be a thing now. I don\u2019t have kids so I wouldn\u2019t know, but from what I\u2019ve seen with friends the second baby shower is smaller (a sprinkle) unless they have a baby of the opposite sex.", "Shelly has a baby- I haven\u2019t seen any mention that Mary has another child?", "Plus, the fact that Shelley reacted like that is a huge red flag in terms of friendship. I suggest you maybe consult Mary and let her know that her baby shower organizer is a psychopath.", "Definitely share with Mary how disappointed you are that the best day for everyone else to have her brunch is the one day you had previous commitments.  That way she hears from you that Shelley knew you couldn't make it and not whatever story Shelley wants to spin.", "NTA.  Your kid should come first.  What is she smoking?  You told her not on Saturday, she scheduled it for Saturday, you can't go.  Plain and simple as that.  Is she going to pay for your parents to reschedule their flight, or your husband's list wages?", "Just let her know why you cannot attend, ignore the host. Edit: typo", "That's awesome! Host of the brunch sounds even more like a ponce now.", "Be sure to invite Shelly to a future event 3 blocks away from your place.  Let her see how fun it is to commute 40min each way with a baby in tow.  Bet she declines the invite.  NTA.", "If OP is responding to Shelly, she should stop. It\u2019s done.", "Besides appearing malicious in her choices of date & venue, Shelley is behaving like an invitation is an order that you attend rather than a request for your presence.  Shelley is rude AF & OP is NTA.", "International flight, at that. The cheapest ones.", "OP isn\u2019t the only mom though. She said Shelley has a 4mo old", "You are definitely NTA.  I don't see Shelley offering to take your parents to the airport or send them an Uber!", "Just curious: is there a reason you can\u2019t bring your baby with you to the brunch? Is this gathering child free or are you just not comfortable bringing your baby along?", "Best advice!", "Yeah it honestly sounds like Mary wants OP there and doesn't know the full story. Shelley just made it whatever Shelley wanted and is nowpanicking by guilt tripping OP. Shelley sucks", "Yes exactly this \n\nNTA", "Don't say how disappointed you are it makes the passive aggressiveness of it too obvious, give her a baby shower gift early and bring it up that way", "Better yet is plan something extremely fun that \u2018Shelly\u2019 would like to do on a day she isn\u2019t going to be available. When she replies she can\u2019t come and \u2018that the date should be changed to accommodate her\u2019 she should be told nope.", "Shelly is the one. Mary is the pregnant one. I was wrong in ned too", "Mary isn\u2019t the one harassing OP about missing the brunch. Shelley is.", "The sentence right before saying Shelley has a kid OP says she's referred to as the only mom. I'm not sure why Shelley doesn't qualify with a four month old, but that's how OP characterized it.", "The restaurant doesn\u2019t allow under 12s", "This was my question too. I have been to baby showers where babies were brought, and they're usually non-alcohol events anyway.", "Why punish Mary for something she isn't doing? Shelley is the one organizing all of this.", "Thank you!  Fixed it :)", "My bad.  Thanks!  Fixed  it.", "Shelley referred to her as the only mom. It\u2019s obvious Shelley is nuts.", "I was reading those two posts hoping that they accidently switched names and meant Shelley and not Mary.", "I think they mixed up the names.", "Yeah it\u2019s the \u201cMary Shelley\u201d thing that\u2019s making my eyes cross; I can\u2019t keep track of who is who because I keep getting distracted by the 19th century author.", "Oops got the names wrong I\u2019ll\nEdit", "Mary/Shelley\u2026Whatever yikes!"]}
