All the fake outrageous solutions Shelley is offering about abandoning her parents or own child are so she can have a clear conscience when she goes to tell the other friend that \"I even tried so hard to convince OP to come and offered a bunch of solutions to her objections but it's almost like she was *trying* to make a point about not supporting you...\"\n\nShelley is trying to make OP look like a selfish one-way friend to open up the special avenue OP has being the only other mom by Shelley becoming the friend who was \"there for her\" when other people disappointed. The relationship between OP and the new mom is obviously close if she's texting just her outside of the group chats that include Shelley and Shelley can't stand it.", "Yeah I totally understand if that\u2019s the most convenient time for the other people it\u2019s fine!

Some people just can't be reasoned with.", "Yeah after the shower (you don't want to spoil any surprises and accidentally become an ahole) I'd explain to Mary. Depending on whether she seems upset with OP and whether she believes her I'd keep it at casual check in up to showing her screenshot evidence (take screenshots now in case it's e.g. WhatsApp and she deletes for all or edits or something)", "Lol at summons.", "OP didn't try to make the baby shower revolve around schedule. Husband had work, no babysitter, parents needed a ride to the airport. She simply explained why she couldn't make it.

I had no problem not going.\n\nShe\u2019s the one insisting I go.\n\nShould I leave my 1yo home alone? Just give him a juice box and some cartoons maybe?\n\nAnd a 90 minute drive to a max 90 minute brunch is a fucking long drive even if I did have childcare which I don\u2019t!", "How is politely saying you can't attend the same as \"revolving it around your schedule\" in your mind? No really I would like to understand how your brain functions with that level of mental gymnastics. Is it because OP explained WHY she couldn't attend? Is that the part that makes it all about her?\n\nAre we also ignoring the fact that none of this was actually planned by the expecting mother but by a 'friend' and OP is still keeping in contact with the actual expecting mother and on good terms?\n\nIf your friends are planning an event and asked everyone for the times they're available and you made it clear in no uncertain language that you absolutely can't make it on a certain day then the event is still scheduled for that day then are you the asshole for not attending?", "Found Shelly.", "It seems to be a thing now.

I suggest you maybe consult Mary and let her know that her baby shower organizer is a psychopath.", "Definitely share with Mary how disappointed you are that the best day for everyone else to have her brunch is the one day you had previous commitments.  That way she hears from you that Shelley knew you couldn't make it and not whatever story Shelley wants to spin.", "NTA.  Your kid should come first.  What is she smoking?  You told her not on Saturday, she scheduled it for Saturday, you can't go.  Plain and simple as that.  Is she going to pay for your parents to reschedule their flight, or your husband's list wages?", "Just let her know why you cannot attend, ignore the host. Edit: typo", "That's awesome! Host of the brunch sounds even more like a ponce now.", "Be sure to invite Shelly to a future event 3 blocks away from your place.

Shelley is rude AF & OP is NTA.", "International flight, at that. The cheapest ones.", "OP isn\u2019t the only mom though. She said Shelley has a 4mo old", "You are definitely NTA.  I don't see Shelley offering to take your parents to the airport or send them an Uber!", "Just curious: is there a reason you can\u2019t bring your baby with you to the brunch? Is this gathering child free or are you just not comfortable bringing your baby along?", "Best advice!", "Yeah it honestly sounds like Mary wants OP there and doesn't know the full story. Shelley just made it whatever Shelley wanted and is nowpanicking by guilt tripping OP.

If she wants it that day then she needs to accept that you can't attend for good reasons, you clearly told it doesn't work for you! She clearly doesn't understand the word no or that people have responsibilities!  To harrass you through your husband's phone as well is not ok!

Let her know that you tried to work with the planner and let the planner know well in advance the dates that will absolutely not work for you.

I only have one kid and didn't even have one...Here's a response;\n\nI would be happy to make it if you send me $$ for the babysitter I will have to obtain and $$ for the gas I will need to get to the desired location since the day was booked on a day that I said I could NOT make it because of these things. Otherwise, accept my no because it is not going to be feasible for me to attend otherwise.", "NTA.

Is it possible that Shelley knows you and Mary are in contact and that Mary seeks you out for advice?  Is Shelley a little jelly and trying to drive a wedge between you and Mary so *she* can be the fountain of Mommy advice?", "Absolutely NTA.

You clearly told her your limits and she intentionally ignored them. My Spidey senses tell me she's deliberately doing this so she can look like the good one and put a wedge between you and Mary.
