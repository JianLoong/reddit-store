I have finished my law study 1 year ago. I am currently 2 months pregnant with our first child. My husband has his own company where he works. When we got married he wanted me to sign a prenup which stated that I am not entitled to any of his assets if we get a divorce and he is not entitled to my assets. (I have significantly less than him). My husband said he didn't want me to work for any boss or whatsoever. We are not struggling financially and he gives me money but I still want to make something for myself as well. My husband is renting homes as well and he gives me the rent of 2 houses on top of everything else. So he said I don't have to work. I told my husband that I am gonna work and we got in a fight. He asked why I insisted and I said \"let's say you leave me today then what? I won't have anything left for myself besides what I already had. I don't want to depend on you for everything I want to be able to handle myself if I have to\". This happened 4 month ago before I got pregnant.\n\n2 months ago my husband surprised me with my own office. I found out the office was in his name (2 weeks ago) and I asked him to put it in my name as it is my office and I am the one who is working here. He said no and said that it doesn't matter because we are a team. I told him that he was the one who didn't want me working for a boss so he should put the office in my name then. We again got in a fight and he accused me of planning to leave him once our child is born. I again explained that I just want to be independent and make my own money. He said that the office being in his name doesn't change it and that I don't trust him. I told him that if I am the one managing everything and going there every day than the office is mine and should be in my name. My MIL has been calling me none stop to tell me that I am TA and she is saying I am trying to get his money. Which is not the case at all. I feel like I might be TA for asking this and my husband is now thinking I don't trust him. So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I see some people are concerned whether I have a personal account or not. Yes I do have an personal account. The money I get goes there. And the prenup is meant for our own assets. Joint assets are to be spilt if we get a divorce or something. But we have almost 0 joint assets he puts almost everything in his name. The only thing we share is a an appartement (where we don't live) and the car.

What he's done here is open a business in his name that he expects you to run for him.

It's that he's trying to own your actual business. Tell him you will accept his generous offer of office space but will open the actual business in your own name. Offer to rent the space from him. If you even pay him one dollar, then it becomes clear that he is the landlord and not the owner of the business. If this is not agreeable to him, get your own office space and do it totally on your own.\n\nAlso, most prenups protect assets each party brought into the marriage. They normally say money earned by either party DURING the marriage is joint property. Therefore, depending upon how the prenup is worded, he might still be entitled to half your money in the event of a divorce even if he is not a part owner of your business. But then you would also be entitled to half the money he earns as well.\n\nAlso, are you in an arranged marriage? Why does your husband think you are trying to leave him.

I get he doesn\u2019t gift you the space but the company in his name? Nope! That just means that you work for him. Meaning that when he doesn\u2019t want you to work (probably once the baby is born) he can just \u201cfire\u201d you.

If he doesn\u2019t relent then just create your own. Really, set up your own company, if you have to rent out space. If you can use his then make a rental agreement. Protect yourself.\n\nAlso when he says that you don\u2019t trust him turn it around: he doesn\u2019t trust you. He even said that you might leave him. Turn it around on him, that you are hurt by his lack of trust. \n\nOh and if none of the above works just get a job. He doesn\u2019t want you to work for someone else? Tough luck, not his choice.

We don't know what her husband has been saying to her but even she said she doesn't want to depend on him, now she just has to act on those feelings. That's the hard part but very doable, since, unlike most people in abusive relationships, she knows how to get out. She has that knowledge and all she has to do now is be brave enough to act on it. She's not an AH in this situation but she is an AH to herself and her child if she continues to stay in this situation any longer.", "It\u2019s not victim blaming.

Here, the pre-nup would only apply to assets brought into the marriage.  Any assets acquired during the marriage, even if they are in his name, would be marital assets.  So that includes the business.  HOWEVER, if she started the business in her name as her asset, it could also be a marital asset.  It's a fucked up position to be in - he has the assets, she has the earning power.  Needs to hash this out legally right away because she could wind up with part of her income going to him even if they split, if the business is a marital asset.", "Normally you are correct, this is a little confusing for me as well. It\u2019s likely that the husband has a corporation (which would be covered by the prenup) and **that** is what he is putting things under.
