It's been a while and I'm not sure if anyone would even care at this point but I accidentally logged into my throwaway on an old laptop and remembered this.  \nQuite frankly, I'm really embarasssed and ashamed to reread my original post. My attitude was terrible and it's one of those moments I wish I could go back in time and shake some sense into my past self. As many people in the comments predicted, I know longer have a relationship of any kind with my daughter, or two of my other kids. COVID and lockdowns did a number on our family, I'll just say that.  \nI've been doing a LOT of reflecting and therapy over the last year and I realise I've not been the kind of mother my children have needed in their lives. I have no contact with my daughter now - who has married and moved abroad now - and, from her wishes, this will not be changing anytime soon. I also have very little contact with two of my other children. My relationship with my final child is strained and I am doing everything I can not to break it.  \nAfter having logged into this account again and seeing that post, I find myself desperately wishing to go back in time and maybe I could've stopped the breaking of my family if I'd behaved differently here.  \nI don't really know what I want to say here. Maybe just hopefully encourage one person who has been deemed 'the asshole' to reflect sooner rather than later and maybe their lives won't go the same way as mine.", "created_utc": 1697063426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175qy8m/update_aita_for_ruining_my_daughters_graduation/", "score": 778, "replies": ["Hey,\n\nI know that probably wasn\u2019t an easy post for you to write, but I\u2019m glad you did.\n\nYour original post was a lot. \n\nBut it sounds like you have turned a corner in therapy and have developed a lot of self awareness. My mum too ruined my graduation and my wedding too by making it about her. \n\nWe were no contact for many years but even when we did speak again, she had absolutely no remorse for any of the things she did. She passed away a few years ago and whilst I have no regrets about going no contact as it was necessary, I find it very difficult that I will never get an apology from her.\n\nI\u2019m not saying contact your daughter, respecting her wish of not being in touch is the right thing to do but take what you have learned from therapy and demonstrate that you are sorry to the kids that you are in touch with, in how you behave, not through words.\n\nIt might not pan out but they deserve that from you and once they see it\u2019s genuine they may be able to reassess how they feel about the relationship. But good on your for going on this journey, a lot of people don\u2019t.", "I know comments saying your kids won\u2019t talk to you can feel like an attack, but it often comes from people that have been there and can tell the child is at a breaking point. \n\nWhat really caught me was that YOU\u2019VE been there with your own mother. \n\nI hope others see that and reflect on their own actions as well. Just bc we\u2019ve cut out the toxic people in our lives doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t end up in the same position if we don\u2019t work on our relationships.", "I'm sorry you learned your lesson too late. That happens sometimes.", "Congratulations on taking the very difficult (and often scary) step of attending therapy. I wish you and your family the best :)", "Quick question. Why are the other kids also NC or very little contact with you? Just curious to hear why all of your kids would do this. What were the instances that led to this? \nWell done though on trying to salvage your relationship with your youngest.", "I appreciate your reflection, but you got exactly what you bargained for.\n\nI hope you find peace.", "Sad to say, sometimes you can't apologize enough.  There's just regrets to carry,  And perhaps, learning to be a better person.", "My mother died a year ago. I hadn't spoken to her on over a decade and that didn't change even with her impending death. She lived ten miles away. I don't miss her. I don't regret cutting her off. My children wanted nothing to do with her either.\n\nFall on your knees if you want a relationship with your remaining child. Honestly, completely admit your failings. Make no part of this about your feelings. Just accept theirs and listen. It's your only chance. Bite your tongue, pinch your arm, and dig your nails into your palm wherever you get the instinct to explain or excuse your behaviour.\n\nYou can't take back whatever caused them all to leave you. Your only hope is tightly bind whatever toxic thing it is you leak. Your therapist is your plumber. They are the only one who should be asked to help you deal\nwith it. Never spill another drop on your children.\n\nMy mother had 40 years to be a good mother. A decade to take accountability. She chose to die never seeing me or my children again. Pathetic and alone with her twisted view of the situation. Unable to just listen. Never once admitting fault, just pretending it never happened and, if it did, she had an excuse.\n\nShe's your ghost of Christmas future.", "It might be too late to repair your relationships with your children, and that is sad. My flawed, mother\u2019s heart feels the ache for you. \n\nAll you can do now is focus on what you can control, and that is yourself. It sounds like you have taken some huge steps. It might be too late with your kids, but it\u2019s not too late to help others and spread love and peace within your circle, as small or large as that might be. You could look for ways to help other mother\u2019s identify and process their own unhealthy behaviors and lack of boundaries. Or get involved with an organization that provides mentors to at risk kids. Maybe you can provide them a slice of the healthy and supportive mothering you wished you had given to your kids. But don\u2019t do it to prove you\u2019re \u201cbetter\u201d now. Don\u2019t broadcast your actions or hope for approval or credit. Only do it to help others and for your own knowledge that you didn\u2019t waste the lessons you learned.", "I hope your children are doing well and have the love and support they need.", "As a mother (50yo) I feel disappointment in your update. \n\nYou are ashamed of who you were 4-5 years ago. Now that you read that post accidentally, now you start reflecting on your past actions. I mean, you could have reflected 4 years ago. \n\nThink about it, your daughter was asking you to reflect on your actions that hurt her, and acknowledge her feelings. You said no. Your husband agreed with your daughter. You again said no. You come here where thousands, thousands of people tell you YTA. You again, repeatedly, stubbornly, said no. \n\nThree kids have gone no contact with their mother. You didn't reflect on your actions after the first kid, nor after the second, not even after the third one. No. It takes an old laptop and a forgotten Reddit post to get you to see the light. \n\nI'm glad so many people are cheering you on. I hope you end your reflections soon enough that you don't lose the fourth kid too. So I guess I'm on your corner, cheering for you also, because all of us need kindness and love. And if you have finally, finally realized your mistakes, and you want to be a better person, please start right now.", "I'm estranged from my mother. I told her she's never going to see me again. I intend to keep that up until the day she dies. I'll be skipping the funeral.\n\nI can only hope she manages to see the missing missing reasons I cut her off my myself and my wife, like you have with your daughter (and hopefully your other estranged children).", "Maybe if your kids see the changes, things might change. Keep trying therapy.", "Sounds nice but the shitty parent having a moment of realisation and then feeling the need to update Redditors on how right they were sounds more like creative writing than how most shitty parents behave. I presume this is all made up.", "I never interact on this subreddit, but this post moved me. \n\nMy family has a history of abuse, estrangement, and, I suspect, narcissism that goes back generations. I didn\u2019t notice it as a young kid, but it broke my family as I knew it apart when I was in middle school. That was 13 years ago and we have never been the same. \n\nMy dad is estranged from his father, his sister, and most of the rest of his family. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to estrange myself from any of our relatives myself\u2014 I was 12 at the time. It was a major point of contention and to this day, it\u2019s an awful conversation that goes terribly every time you have it. \n\nReading your original post and comments were like reading something written by my dad, his dad, or someone else in my family. He\u2019s said some of those exact words to me about how wrong it is of me to keep in touch with my other family members. So to say that it was therapeutic to read a follow up like this is an understatement. I can only hope that my family members come to these realizations before it\u2019s too late. In a lot of ways, I\u2019ve already given up.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that it may be too late for you to fully repair the relationships you\u2019ve lost, but for what it\u2019s worth, your ability to finally come to this conclusion is admirable. My grandfather is 91, and as far as I\u2019ve seen, has never reached that point himself. I\u2019m also sorry that if you, like me, my father, his father, and even further beyond that were raised in an environment that made this endless cycle of estrangement inevitable. I hope that if you\u2019re able to turn your relationship with your remaining child around, that the two of you can work together to establish healthier family dynamics for any future generations. \n\nRegardless, thanks for sharing. I hope this post does snap someone out of it before it\u2019s too late. And genuinely, good luck to you.", "You have not done any reflection and this post tells a lot. \"COVID did a number in my family\" still not taking responsibility. It's because of COVID that you don't have a relationship with your kid. It's definitely not because you're a narcissist lol", "Oh wow! Look at that! Reflecting on your wrongdoings 4 years after you daughter tried to fix things like an adult. Impressive! You want people to clap? Honestly you deserve it. Your own mother doesn't speak to you; your partner is no longer with you; and more than one of your children has thrown you out of their lives... Hmmm, is almost as if a narcissistic attitude has consequences. I'm glad your daughter realized she deserved better than to tolerate you.", "To say \"It was my fault and I wish to take back the things I did\" means absolutely nothing.  \nUnfortunately saying sorry wont turn back time.  \nI would feel sorry for you but its hard to believe just a couple of forgivable actions here and there causes a parent to lose their relationship with each and everyone of their children.  \nI really dont wish to know what else you did.  \nI dont want to kick you when you are down, maybe you can dedicate the rest of your life to charity and help others but there is no such thing as redemption, thats just a religious thing that is valuable for the wrongdoers, never for their victims.", "It might be too late to repair your relationship with any of your children. \n\nI feel terrible for your kids.\n\nBut at least you are working on improving yourself and seeing your wrongs.", "So you have no contact with one kid, very little with two others and your relationship with the last kid is also going sideways, you have no contact with your own mother, you have an ex-husband you couldn't even sit next to for a couple of hours during your daughters graduation buuuuut COVID is probably the reason?\n\nI think you still have a lot of reflecting to do, best of luck.", "I do wonder if her mother cut her off for the toxicness instead of the other way around.", "I don\u2019t expect to see this much gentle thoughtfulness and grace in real life, much less on an anonymous social media forum, but here we are\u2026.\n\nThanks, Redditor for unexpectedly reaffirming my faith in humanity.\n\nI started to type Thanks, Sloopypoopypoppy, but had to call you Redditor to get it typed out with all sincerity.\n\nAnyway, good response.", "We all wish we could acquire wisdom at less of a cost. Alas, we wouldn\u2019t wish it if it didn\u2019t happen.", "Mine was the same. I tried explaining, even before I moved out (at 17!), but in the end it was more important to retain her toxic behaviours than it was to keep me around. She made her choices, though she wasn't happy with them. I don't think she had it in her to be happy. \n\nThe choice I made to leave and go NC saved my life.", "For OP to have 3 of her 4 children not speaking (or barely speaking) to her she must\u2019ve had a really toxic behaviour towards them for a very long time. Children with healthy relationships with their parents do not cut them off for no good reason, and the fact that her 4th child\u2019s relationship with her is also strained speaks volumes.", "If you notice, the OP blames COVID for a lot  even though the problems clearly existed before COVID.", "\\- My son was (is?) a COVID denier and we clashed during the height of lockdown on the best way to go about things and our relationship has not recovered since\n\n\\- Similarly to my eldst daughter, my daughter has been struggling with issues from her childhood (my fault) and being forced in one home during lockdown exacerbated her feelings and she is now taking time to put some space between us until she's ready to decide how and if she wants to move forward. I have respected this.\n\nWhen I say my relationship with my youngest is strained, I mean in the sense that she very clearly feels conflicted about staying \"loyal\" to me vs. her siblings. As she still lives at home, I see the fallout of this personal conflict and see hopw it strains our relationship and am doing my best not make her think she has to \"pick sides\" while also trying to improve the quality of our relationship. As I dont have contact with her siblings, I don't know if they also feel like their relationship with my youngest is strained.", "Because she's a narcissist. This is just a pity party, I don't honestly think she did and reflecting.", "Bad wording on my part. I didn't mean logging into this account made me reflect, I just meant logging into this account made me remember that I'd posted about this.", "She's still making excuses. It was covid, it was lockdown! I hope she sorts herself out before the fourth kid goes NC but step one is to stop making excuses.", "Again, poor wording on my part I suppose, but \"COVID did a number on our family\" was shorthand for:\n\n\\- My son was (is?) a COVID denier and we clashed during the height of lockdown on the best way to go about things and our relationship has not recovered since\n\n\\- Similarly to my eldst daughter, my daughter has been struggling with issues from her childhood (my fault) and being forced in one home during lockdown exacerbated her feelings and she is now taking time to put some space between us until she's ready to decide how and if she wants to move forward.

Forgiveness is for victims, from victims, by victims.\n\nRedemption does not require the consent or explicit approval of a victim to be necessary in order for someone to be redeemed.\n\nRedemption is a mechanism of social judgment and all it requires is a general consensus of a community to overlook prior transgressions based on current behavior.\n\nIf someone was an extremely hurtful bully during their freshmen years and then isolated from the student body for their actions, they do not require the forgiveness of the the people they victimized to be effectively redeemed in their senior year by that same student body.\n\nGod, there is nothing I despise more than when someone has a holier-than-thou punitive opinion that they have to share with anyone and everyone who has done a bad thing.\n\nRedemption and rehabilitation exist, live with that reality.", ">I dont want to kick you when you are down\n\nEntire comment is kicking OP while she's down.", "My mother and I have begun to repair our relationship over the last three years.", "Thank you.", "Have you seen her replies to her previous post?  \nShe was saying \"my daughter should respect my word and not have contact with her grandma\"  \nLike she as a mother should be obeyed but she as a daughter can do whatever she wants.  \nAlso when OP gets called narcissist she says \"if anyone is a narcissist here thats my daughter\".  \nWhat a way to deflect guilt.", "yes, I don't think Covid was to blame here.
