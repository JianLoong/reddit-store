It's been a while and I'm not sure if anyone would even care at this point but I accidentally logged into my throwaway on an old laptop and remembered this.  \nQuite frankly, I'm really embarasssed and ashamed to reread my original post. My attitude was terrible and it's one of those moments I wish I could go back in time and shake some sense into my past self. As many people in the comments predicted, I know longer have a relationship of any kind with my daughter, or two of my other kids. COVID and lockdowns did a number on our family, I'll just say that.  \nI've been doing a LOT of reflecting and therapy over the last year and I realise I've not been the kind of mother my children have needed in their lives. I have no contact with my daughter now - who has married and moved abroad now - and, from her wishes, this will not be changing anytime soon. I also have very little contact with two of my other children. My relationship with my final child is strained and I am doing everything I can not to break it.  \nAfter having logged into this account again and seeing that post, I find myself desperately wishing to go back in time and maybe I could've stopped the breaking of my family if I'd behaved differently here.  \nI don't really know what I want to say here. Maybe just hopefully encourage one person who has been deemed 'the asshole' to reflect sooner rather than later and maybe their lives won't go the same way as mine.", "created_utc": 1697063426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175qy8m/update_aita_for_ruining_my_daughters_graduation/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Hey,\n\nI know that probably wasn\u2019t an easy post for you to write, but I\u2019m glad you did.\n\nYour original post was a lot. \n\nBut it sounds like you have turned a corner in therapy and have developed a lot of self awareness. My mum too ruined my graduation and my wedding too by making it about her. \n\nWe were no contact for many years but even when we did speak again, she had absolutely no remorse for any of the things she did. She passed away a few years ago and whilst I have no regrets about going no contact as it was necessary, I find it very difficult that I will never get an apology from her.\n\nI\u2019m not saying contact your daughter, respecting her wish of not being in touch is the right thing to do but take what you have learned from therapy and demonstrate that you are sorry to the kids that you are in touch with, in how you behave, not through words.\n\nIt might not pan out but they deserve that from you and once they see it\u2019s genuine they may be able to reassess how they feel about the relationship. But good on your for going on this journey, a lot of people don\u2019t.", "I know comments saying your kids won\u2019t talk to you can feel like an attack, but it often comes from people that have been there and can tell the child is at a breaking point. \n\nWhat really caught me was that YOU\u2019VE been there with your own mother. \n\nI hope others see that and reflect on their own actions as well. Just bc we\u2019ve cut out the toxic people in our lives doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t end up in the same position if we don\u2019t work on our relationships.", "I'm sorry you learned your lesson too late. That happens sometimes.", "Congratulations on taking the very difficult (and often scary) step of attending therapy. I wish you and your family the best :)", "Quick question. Why are the other kids also NC or very little contact with you? Just curious to hear why all of your kids would do this. What were the instances that led to this? \nWell done though on trying to salvage your relationship with your youngest.", "I appreciate your reflection, but you got exactly what you bargained for.\n\nI hope you find peace.", "Sad to say, sometimes you can't apologize enough.  There's just regrets to carry,  And perhaps, learning to be a better person."]}
