I live in Western Europe. We became best friends. After a year and half I traveled to Brazil to meet her. It turned into an on-off thing, one month of official dating and back to on-off, officially we were friends. Very confusing for me. We lived together for 5 months until I went back home. We both hurt each other. Two months ago, we had an argument when I asked her to be more respectful and she blocked me instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have an eSIM of Brazilian provider TIM. It's a subscription in her name but linked to my creditcard. The subscription is for me, when I was in Brazil. After she blocked me I kept paying so she wouldn't get into trouble, get a bad credit score or something like that. My ex suddenly reappeared and asked me about the sim. She asked if I could cancel it and I said I would try. There was also another argument and she blocked me again. Told me I should send an email about the subscription.The problem to cancel is that there was a bug in my settings and I can't see the phone number. I also don't have a signal here so I can't call anyone to know the number. Without the number I can't log in on the TIM website to cancel. Also can't use the Whatsapp bot. I don't know enough Portuguese to call the helpdesk. I tried finding a TIM person online to help. I also tried looking for a way to figure out the phone number or a way to talk English to the TIM helpdesk. But no luck. I don't know what else I could have done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my email to her about the subscription I apologized for hurting her and took accountability for my mistakes and how I made her feel. She ignored it and she replied with an email where I felt like she was ordering me instead of asking. A bad habit she often did when we lived together. I let it slide the first time but the second reply was even more demanding. So I was angry and told her not to do that. I also didn't like that she just expects me to keep paying until she had time to take care of it, without telling me when. So I said I would give her until July to cancel the subscription. It's 6 weeks until the July payment, I think that is more than enough time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was super angry. She send me several angry emails, minutes apart, telling me I'm selfish and entitled. That she was helping me and cancelling is my responsibility. And that I should never talk to her again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my mistake was not telling her that I realize this should be my responsibility but giving the unusual circumstances, me being in a different country, there's not much I could do. I had it even typed out but then deleted it, which makes me feel dumb now. And maybe I should have asked how much time she would need instead of setting a deadline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I have tried harder to cancel it myself? Am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'm heartbroken and feel really sad. This is a person I deeply care about and even though she has hurt me deeply, I still only want what's best for her. I tried to help and this feels like a kick in the nuts. It made me cry.", "created_utc": 1685196030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t89ro/aita_for_not_cancelling_my_phone_subscription_in/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Box up the phone and send it to her where she needs to sign to cancel.  More than likely if it\u2019s in her name you won\u2019t be able to cancel it anyways. You\u2019re just the one paying the bill which doesn\u2019t always matter.  Send her the phone. Tell her you will pay the next bill, which should give her time to cancel it and then it\u2019s done. Probably cheaper than you going back to Brazil. Then she knows it\u2019s done and you can stop payment or dispute the payment with your credit card company. Make sure you send registered mail so that you have a paper trail and confirmation that she got the phone back.", "NTA. You seem like a lovely person who got screwed over. It\u2019s not your responsibility", "NTA.  Call your credit card provider and explain the situation - they might be able to help.", "To clarify: She is going to cancel now. She will have to visit a TIM store. That's why she's so mad. She thinks it's my responsibility.\n\nThis was her email to me:\n\n>With my CPF and name, I can only cancel it in person, which will be such a nuisance.  \nAsk the Reddit person how they did it and let me know. Try sending Tim an email asking about it too.   \nIf that doesn\u2019t work, keep the subscription until I\u2019m able to visit a Tim store the cancel it. \n\nI felt like she was ordering me. Especially because last week she was mad at me for assuming something and said I should always ask from now on. And then she doesn't ask me. So I pushed back and told her she had 6 weeks. I was angry. But if she had replied she needed more time I would have given it.\n\nInstead I got multiple emails saying I'm selfish and entitled.", "ESH. You two clearly need to just stop talking to each other, there is no possibility for a civil friendship while you\u2019re still getting over each other like this. It\u2019s clear from both sides that your emotions are getting in the way, causing you to both be petty and mean. Can\u2019t say on how to cancel the phone, but once this is all done you need to block each other. You can\u2019t be friends while you\u2019re getting over someone like this.", "NTA - call your credit card company and block all future charges. Email her and tell her she needs to cancel the plan or it\u2019s her bill from now on. Then block her completely on everything and move on with life. She sounds like a drama llama.", "NTA.  You might be able to find someone who speaks Portuguese at the foreign language department at a University in your country.  Also, check with hospitals.  They often have a list of interpreters for many different language.  Sorry you are going through this.", "You need to call from a working Tim number. So I would need to go to Brazil.", "She doesn\u2019t use TIM. It was solely to help me. I feel really bad about it.

So the only thing you can do is take a step back and look at the situation and determine if anything she said is true, if so try to be better in the future.  If not then you know that she was simple hurt and trying to make you hurt too which isn't right.", "If you still have the phone a eSIM working with TIM you can call 144 or 1056 to reach a support person at least according the TIM website.

I am assuming she has the bill and the account number and any security questions TIM might ask to cancel the account.  Tell her to call and cancel and if she doesn't you will cancel payment and it will leave her owning the last statement balance.  Tell her it is not what you want too do but at this point it is your only option since you cannot cancel from where you are.  Do not continue to pay for a service no one is using particularly if the money can be spent better elsewhere.
