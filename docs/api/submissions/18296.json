I live in Western Europe. We became best friends. After a year and half I traveled to Brazil to meet her. It turned into an on-off thing, one month of official dating and back to on-off, officially we were friends. Very confusing for me. We lived together for 5 months until I went back home. We both hurt each other. Two months ago, we had an argument when I asked her to be more respectful and she blocked me instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have an eSIM of Brazilian provider TIM. It's a subscription in her name but linked to my creditcard. The subscription is for me, when I was in Brazil. After she blocked me I kept paying so she wouldn't get into trouble, get a bad credit score or something like that. My ex suddenly reappeared and asked me about the sim. She asked if I could cancel it and I said I would try. There was also another argument and she blocked me again. Told me I should send an email about the subscription.The problem to cancel is that there was a bug in my settings and I can't see the phone number. I also don't have a signal here so I can't call anyone to know the number. Without the number I can't log in on the TIM website to cancel. Also can't use the Whatsapp bot. I don't know enough Portuguese to call the helpdesk. I tried finding a TIM person online to help. I also tried looking for a way to figure out the phone number or a way to talk English to the TIM helpdesk. But no luck. I don't know what else I could have done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my email to her about the subscription I apologized for hurting her and took accountability for my mistakes and how I made her feel. She ignored it and she replied with an email where I felt like she was ordering me instead of asking. A bad habit she often did when we lived together. I let it slide the first time but the second reply was even more demanding. So I was angry and told her not to do that. I also didn't like that she just expects me to keep paying until she had time to take care of it, without telling me when. So I said I would give her until July to cancel the subscription. It's 6 weeks until the July payment, I think that is more than enough time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was super angry. She send me several angry emails, minutes apart, telling me I'm selfish and entitled. That she was helping me and cancelling is my responsibility. And that I should never talk to her again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my mistake was not telling her that I realize this should be my responsibility but giving the unusual circumstances, me being in a different country, there's not much I could do. I had it even typed out but then deleted it, which makes me feel dumb now. And maybe I should have asked how much time she would need instead of setting a deadline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I have tried harder to cancel it myself? Am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'm heartbroken and feel really sad. This is a person I deeply care about and even though she has hurt me deeply, I still only want what's best for her. I tried to help and this feels like a kick in the nuts. It made me cry.\n\nEdit:\nMy conclusion is that I'm the asshole. I overreacted to what I perceived as her ordering me around. I should have asked her how much time she would need instead of setting a deadline.

Box up the phone and send it to her where she needs to sign to cancel.  More than likely if it\u2019s in her name you won\u2019t be able to cancel it anyways. You\u2019re just the one paying the bill which doesn\u2019t always matter.  Send her the phone. Tell her you will pay the next bill, which should give her time to cancel it and then it\u2019s done. Probably cheaper than you going back to Brazil. Then she knows it\u2019s done and you can stop payment or dispute the payment with your credit card company.

Tell her it is not what you want too do but at this point it is your only option since you cannot cancel from where you are.

Not the other way around. \nAnd because she had told me I should always ask from now on.

Changing numbers should be left as a last resort.", "Thank you. It seems like everyone is glossing over how he's getting angry with her for setting and enforcing a boundary. She doesn't want to continue any form of relationship with him or discuss it, she just wants this one thing taken care of. He used it as an opportunity to bring up something unrelated and then got angry when she redirected the conversation. Red flags all around. YTA, soft due to lack of info. If you can't use this cell service in your current country you should have cancelled before you moved. You're not doing her a favor by continuing to pay the bill, you're fulfilling an obligation.", "Based on this comment I would say Y T A because it\u2019s stupid to get bent out of shape over this wording. Plus you state that cancelling it is for her when in another comment you mention having financial issues. \n\nSend them an email already or cancel the payments and let her deal with it. And them move on. There are many women that would value you", "Look. I'm Brazilian, and when I lived there, my provider was TIM. Cancelling it is really not that much of a nuisance. She won't have to pay anything, and it won't even take long. And there are TIM stores everywhere (at least, there are in capital cities, I don't know where she lives. If she lives in a smaller town, I can see that getting to a TIM store might indeed be a nuisance).\n\nBut honestly, this is in HER interest, much more than it is yours. After you stop paying, you will have zero consequences, while her CPF (her taxpayer number) will be associated with a debt, and THAT will be a thousand times harder for her to solve. She should be hurrying to solve this herself, I'm shocked that she isn't. Debts associated to your CPF are hell.\n\nYou tried your best to cancel it, and couldn't; you've already given her the deadline. If you want, send her another email: \"I tried cancelling it on my side and couldn't. I have no TIM service here. TIM people don't speak English. This is easier for you to solve than it is for me. As I said before, you have 6 weeks, after which, the payments will stop.\" And then call it a day.", "On the carrier website, there is a possibility to send them a letter requesting the subscription cancellation: https://www.tim.com.br/rj/sobre-a-tim/regulatorio/novas-regras-de-atendimento/cancelamento\n\nOther thing I suggest you is to try enabling the roaming option in your smartphone, if your esim still working, I think it should be able to connect to one mobile carrier from your country. If works, than you can call or send an sms to another phone and see what number pops up.", "I came to the same conclusion earlier so I agree, I think I was wrong. I overreacted. I feel guilty. \nI\u2019m clearly still very hurt by how she treated me. \n\nThe first two payments I was in bad financial shape. It\u2019s okay now.", "Yeah, this is why I was still paying even though she blocked me and had banished me from her life, with no idea when or if she would come back. I had no ill intentions towards her.\n\nIt's possible she was so mad at me because she felt like I was threatening her financial status. I should have asked if 6 weeks was ok instead of telling her. We went to the mall every weekend when i was there. It's only a one hour drive from her small town, which I have been told is not far for Brazilians. :p\n\nBut she could have just told me she needs more time and I would have had no problem with it. Instead she became irrationally angry.\n\nShe told me  \"Honestly, you are just the most entitled and selfish person I've ever met. \"  and \"You've made yourself a problem for me. And I just want this problem solved and gone. \" and other nice stuff.\n\n:( :(", "Roaming doesn\u2019t work. \nThanks for the link.", "Then i\u2019m sorry for the assumptions. And I\u2019m sorry this has been so painful for you. I know the sooner this is over with the less reminders of the hurt you are having", "Yes you are overreacting. It almost seems like you want to keep a connection with her. Even though it\u2019s negative. Even though it\u2019s for a stupid reason.", "I\u2019m sorry, helping her? To cancel a subscription you put in HER name? That solely benefited YOU? You must have been exhausting to date", "I'm confused, was the phone account for your use or her use?", "It\u2019s really hard to get a phone plan in Brazil as a foreigner, especially if you don\u2019t have a CPF (which anyone can get easily but people aren\u2019t necessarily aware of) and if you don\u2019t speak Portuguese. That being said, English is probably not her first language so what OP sees as rudeness is probably just a language barrier. I highly doubt she has to go to the TIM store. She should easily be able to contact them on WhatsApp. Just cancel the payment on your end, inform her politely and thank her for her help and move on. ESH", "Yes, this is her point of view. \nDo you not think we have to take into account the fact that she doesn\u2019t want me in her life. And so there was no obligation anymore on my part to care about any of it. Most people would have just blocked the payments. I tried to solve it but I failed. \n\nI wish I handled it better.", "For me. While I was in Brazil.", "Thanks for explaining how that works.", "Her IQ is 140, she speaks really good English with an American accent. You wouldn't notice she's from Brazil. \n\n  \nThe whatsapp bot didn't work.   \n\n\nBut yeah, I agree I acted wrong. And I feel guilty and bad about it.", "Then I'm unclear on how this is a favor for her. She let you use her name to establish an account for your use. Why did you not cancel the account before you moved to a country that doesn't have support for this cell service?", "You ARE dragging this out. This whole thread is dripping with you not happy with this relationship being over, crazy lame reasons for getting mad about email verbiage, helpless to cancel this subscription (which only benefitted you). By the way, you are \u2018not helping\u2019 her by continuing to pay for this service. You are preventing causing damage to her for a situation you created. \n\nYou are using this to hang on to continue contact. Peel the band-aid off. Cut this out. \n\nYou already found the solution. You gave her a deadline. Keep it. Cancel payments. Send one last email letting her know it has happened. And then LEAVE HER ALONE. \n\nShe is hostile with you because YOU WILL NOT LEAVE HER ALONE.", "My conclusion is that I'm the asshole. I overreacted to what I perceived as her ordering me around. I should have asked her how much time she would need instead of setting a deadline. I think she felt that I was threatening her credit status and that's why she blew up on me. \nI regret not dealing with the situation well.", "NTA. I'm Brazilian, but in Europe.  let me know if I can help, we can tey to figure out the number. But if it's in her name, she should be the one to cancel it.", "Tey?", "If you used her CPF, cancelling payment will mess up her credit.", "I know. I said 6 weeks, thought it was enough time to deal with it. But honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have canceled it without hearing from her if it was ok to do so. \n\nThe whole point was to prevent bad credit for her.", "Sorry to hear that :( But honestly, if things between you two came to this, then it really is best to just call it quits, for both of you.\n\n(And yes, a 1h drive is nothing for us XD The country is too big; in many capitals, you drive for 1h and still haven't left the city itself!)\n\nI bet there's a TIM store at that mall, and that this mall is the main attraction in her area, if you guys went every weekend. She'll be going there soon.\n\nYou can lay out in an email everything you tried to do, like you did here, and if you want, ask her how long she needs.\n\nBut don't give her TOO long: she's probably already been to that mall a few times since you left, she could've easily cancelled the number then. But it's not coming out of her pocket, so she doesn't care. It's wild that she thinks the guy who lives on the other side of the Atlantic and doesn't speak Portuguese should deal with TIM instead of her, who's just a bus ride away from their store and under whose name the number is. One of you seems very entitled, and that person is not you.\n\nAsk her how long she needs, if you want, but if she keeps insulting you instead of working *with* you to solve this, you should really just let her know that you're canceling the payments and call it quits.", "If it\u2019s using her CPF she might be able to cancel it by going into a store. Arrange a time where you can be available by video call and make sure she has all available info", "She told me to never contact her again so there's nothing left to do.  \nIt's sad, really.", "Relationships \ud83d\ude14 Then, yeah, respect her wishes, and stop payments when you said you would. \n\nFwiw: while you seem to have overreacted about her phrasing, she's also overreacting on her side. It's really better for you to go your separate ways."]}
