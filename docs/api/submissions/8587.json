Every time we have dinner it has to be a whole family thing because that\u2019s how his parents like it. They don\u2019t like it when we all make our own thing or get our own thing, which is okay I don\u2019t mind. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that my boyfriend and I (20) always get sent out to retrieve the goods.\n\nI think his parents always ask us because we\u2019re the youngest, but it is SUPER annoying. His parents could be out already and ask us to pick up dinner in the same shopping center they\u2019re already at! His brother and girlfriend could be out and will ask us to pick dinner up before they get home. It\u2019s pretty annoying but what has gotten me really upset recently is I\u2019ve started school again and I\u2019m taking 4 classes. They keep on asking me to pick up dinner even though I\u2019ll be in the middle of taking a quiz (it\u2019s online school). I\u2019ve done it, but it\u2019s annoying. Today they ordered pizza and asked me to pick it up but I was in the middle of a test and I told them it would be an hour. They told me to forget about it. I was like, \u201ccool\u201d because I assumed they had asked their other son and girlfriend. Nope. I finish my test and I have a text from my boyfriend saying he\u2019ll be late coming home because his parents asked him to pick up the pizza. Mind you, the pizza place is on the opposite side of town of where he works. It\u2019s about a 35 minute drive. Someone could have gotten the pizza and been back by the time he got out of work. \n\nI feel like I might be being kind of a brat, but it\u2019s very annoying when there are two other young adults here to get the food. Also, I don\u2019t even eat the food half of the time because I\u2019m sick of fast food so I\u2019ll wait until everyone is asleep to make a sandwich. I feel like an Uber eats driver. \n\n(Also, the times taking the quizzes they would keep texting me asking for updates. 10 minutes would go by and they\u2019ll ask \u201chow much longer do you think?\u201d).\n\n**My boyfriend and I pay $800 a month for the room and for the internet for the house.", "created_utc": 1674964777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nyb9q/wibta_if_i_stopped_picking_up_dinner_for_everyone/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don't set them early, you'll never be able to. You need to be able to say that you're happy to get dinner when you're not otherwise occupied, but you can't drop other things that are important when they're equally able to get dinner themselves.  Also, you and your bf need to start doing your own thing for dinner once in a while and establish that you have that right.

For $800, you could maybe have your own place without being treated like servants.

Your boyfriend needs to also set  boundaries with these type of unnecessary stuff.

And firm.\n\nDon't want them bothering you during your online school? Put a sign on the door saying \"in school. plz do not disturb.\" and put your phone in silent mode or set it up for an automated response.\n\n**You** have the ability to say No and when you do, they have shown that they will respect it. For you to get annoyed that you are saying Yes at other times when you do not want to say Yes, is not their fault, its **your** fault.  You getting annoyed at the parents that your boyfriend says Yes, when he should have said No, is again not the parent's fault.  Its your boyfriend's fault.  He could have said, \"No I'm on the other side of town, it's unreasonable for me to drive so far when you are closer.\"  But he didn't.\n\nDon't hate people for not respecting a boundary you do not communicate to them.  That's your responsibility to do that.\n\nNext time you're busy, say No and then suggest that they get their other son to do it.\n\nYTA, don't blame other people for you lacking a spine.", "INFO:  Who's paying for the food?  \n\nIf you're not paying for the dinner, than the least you can do is go pick it up.", "ESH\n\nI'm going to have to suggest the medieval perspective may apply and say you're simply outranked in the family and are being subject to a sort of polite hazing that is designed to both put you in your place and give you and your boyfriend a stronger foundation over time. It is considered outdated and you do not have to actually put up with it, unless you want to stay there. But if you stay, you have to follow whatever the family rules are.\n\nBetter for you to negotiate than act unilaterally.", "They are going to drain you guys dry.

If you have a cash back cc, you can maybe make up some of the gas/maintence costs by using your cash back card, and then when they cash app you, pay the card.

You have no idea where they live. My mortgage is $800 for a 2bedroom 1 bath condo.", "If it weren't cheap, they wouldn't live there. Partnered couples don't live with parents because it's so fun.
