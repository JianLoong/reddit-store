It worked and he paid for her to attend a top university which she got into which is actually better than the one my son went to.\n\nMy daughter after leaving also confided to me that she does not believe our religion anymore and started living a different lifestyle, one I can never have. She recently graduated, got a work visa and stayed in the western country and has a good job there.\n\nMy husband got really angry when he heard and is feeling really cheated and blames me as I pursuaded him to pay for her education and let her go.

Allowing her to make her own life choices is awesome!  You knew she no longer followed or believed so why would forcing her into a marriage be anything good?", "NTA. And when you said a lifestyle you could never have I could \u201cread your pain\u201d. You did what every parent wants, you gave your daughter the best opportunity to have a choice in life.", "You are a hero. You found a way to give your daughter the life she deserves. The only reason you don\u2019t have money is because of your repressive culture and that is not your fault. And as you know, your daughter is entitled to her own relationship with religion. Please don\u2019t regret this for a minute. NTA.", "Nta. What you did was give your daughter a chance. A chance you weren't ever given. A chance to learn. Have a job.

You did what you had to do to give your child a better life.  I don't believe your husband will ever understand this, though.", "NTA. It is both of your money that paid for her education, because you are a married couple. Good for you for helping your daughter gain an education and live the life she wants to live. You are an awesome parent. Too bad your husband is a sexist bigot who wants to repress you and your daughter. He sounds really controlling and I hope you have support in standing up to him.", "NTA.

NTA, NTA, NTA.\n\n\nEdit to add: Also NTA because there was no conspiracy between you and your daughter. It wasn\u2019t your money, but you also did not force your daughter to make any of the decisions that she did. He took the risk, knowing that it could happen. You gave her an education as good as your son\u2019s. The rest, she chose for herself.", "You did amazing, mama. You're not the asshole.", "Your English is fine and your judgement to help your daughter get a top tier education is spot on. Not knowing your culture I am not equipped to fully understand the family dynamic, but I can certainly say NTA.", "NTA.  You gave your daughter the freedom to live a life she wants, rather than being trapped.  In many places, even when only one spouse works, their income is considered to belong to both spouses (my husband and I are this way, and I have no income due to disability).  If he\u2019s angry, it\u2019s because he wanted his daughter trapped in a patriarchal system where she wouldn\u2019t have control over her own life.  He can sit and spin!", "NTA.   In my opinion,  you are an incredibly brave woman.", "NTA for doing what you needed to save your daughter from oppression and misogyny. You gave her freedom, autonomy and a chance to choose how to live her life. I\u2019m sorry your husband can\u2019t see that this is a good thing.\n\nI\u2019m not generally in favor of lying to one\u2019s spouse but when you\u2019re in a paternalistic, oppressive marriage embedded in a paternalistic, oppressive society, sometimes you do what you have to.", "**NTA!** Stop feeling guilty right this second! You did what any amazing mother would and gave your daughter access to the world, something she wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise. And you\u2019ve educated yourself too! Be very proud of both of these things! As a mother myself, I am very proud of you! Your kids are so fortunate to have you as their mother. I do hope you get to see her again one day, but do not feel bad about your husband spending money on giving her an education. I imagine she feels extremely grateful for what you did for her. If I had been in your shoes, I would\u2019ve tried to do the same thing for my daughter. I\u2019m just sorry you live somewhere that makes you feel unsafe in not following the religion anymore or that forced you to lie simply to educate your daughter. \n\nBe very proud of yourself and of her.

Not trying to be a fear monger, but both you and her need to be more careful because it's obvious he likely feels emasculated.  You also don't mention your son's reaction, so hopefully he's on your side but again you and she have more obstacles than most for choosing your own happiness instead of someone else's.", "NTA a 1000 times over! \nYou\u2019re an amazing mother for making sure your daughter would have a bright future ahead of her and for going against outdated and sexist customs about women. You have nothing to feel guilty about. If anything, you should be extremely proud of yourself", "NTA cheating against the religious patriarchy is never bad. You did the right thing by you and most especially your daughter but you probably did something that will also affect her children positively as well. There is multi generational good from what you did.", "This is so sweet what you did for her. Nta at all. Sending you so much love.", "NTA\n\nIt is not HIS money that paid for her education. It is YOUR JOINTLY HELD money, and you have an equal right to it and how it is spent, according to most western nations' laws on marriage and property rights.  \n\nYour husband may have had a job where he earned that salary. However, courts around the world have ruled that the job you were doing at home, raising your children and keeping house on his behalf, was equally important to the well-being of your family. Think of it this way. If you had not been taking care of your home and children, he would have had to hire nannies and housekeepers. Their salaries would have been deducted from his salary. Therefore, your \"salary\" = the money he saved by having you at home. Both of your jobs resulted in money in the bank and children who were fed and healthy. You had equal rights to that money, and still do, even now that your kids are grown. Because the courts have ruled that your job, doing as your husband wants at home, is valid labor.\n\nI understand that such laws aren't world-wide, and things may be LEGALLY different where you are. But I believe that things are MORALLY and ETHICALLY the same world-wide. You co-own every penny he earns because you feed him, care for him, and raised his children. You had the right to pay for your daughter's education, too.\n\nYou didn't deceive your husband to the extent you're implying. Everything you said was accurate. That you had private, secondary motives was not wrong.\n\nWould it have been better if you could've openly prepared your husband for the possibility that your daughter might choose a career instead of marriage? Of course! But it doesn't sound like you have the kind of relationship where that was a possibility. So you acted in your daughter's best interest, *which is your job.*\n\nAs a mother and a wife, sometimes we have divided loyalties. Ideally, our husband will be united with us in doing what's best for our kids. But when you have to choose between what's best for your daughter, and what will keep your husband happy, you are obligated to prioritize the daughter you've been given to care for. She was the vulnerable one who needs protection and an advocate in the world while growing up. Your husband is a grown man who is not in any way suffering from your daughter's choices.", "NTA, at all. You are an amazing woman for doing everything you had to to give your daughter the life she deserves. \n\nYou also deserve to live the life you want.

The only reason he's able to earn money is that you put in unpaid labour to keep the family running. We like to pretend that women's labour isn't worth anything, but actually, the value of the labour you've put into the family is probably more than enough to pay for your daughter's education. You do free labour so that he can do paid labour. You both contribute labour to the family so you should both be able to reap the financial benefits of that labour.", "No, no, no. It is your money too! Because don\u2019t you work in your home by raising the children? Making sure food is cooked and the house is clean? Your role in your family is just as important even if you don\u2019t get paid for it. I imagine your culture has taught you that only he is allowed to have money because he works outside the home and because he\u2019s a man. But you have worth too! You carried and birthed his children. You raised them so they could live their lives, including convincing your husband to get your daughter a university education.
