It is YOUR JOINTLY HELD money, and you have an equal right to it and how it is spent, according to most western nations' laws on marriage and property rights.  \n\nYour husband may have had a job where he earned that salary. However, courts around the world have ruled that the job you were doing at home, raising your children and keeping house on his behalf, was equally important to the well-being of your family. Think of it this way. If you had not been taking care of your home and children, he would have had to hire nannies and housekeepers. Their salaries would have been deducted from his salary. Therefore, your \"salary\" = the money he saved by having you at home. Both of your jobs resulted in money in the bank and children who were fed and healthy. You had equal rights to that money, and still do, even now that your kids are grown. Because the courts have ruled that your job, doing as your husband wants at home, is valid labor.\n\nI understand that such laws aren't world-wide, and things may be LEGALLY different where you are. But I believe that things are MORALLY and ETHICALLY the same world-wide. You co-own every penny he earns because you feed him, care for him, and raised his children. You had the right to pay for your daughter's education, too.\n\nYou didn't deceive your husband to the extent you're implying. Everything you said was accurate. That you had private, secondary motives was not wrong.\n\nWould it have been better if you could've openly prepared your husband for the possibility that your daughter might choose a career instead of marriage? Of course! But it doesn't sound like you have the kind of relationship where that was a possibility. So you acted in your daughter's best interest, *which is your job.*\n\nAs a mother and a wife, sometimes we have divided loyalties. Ideally, our husband will be united with us in doing what's best for our kids. But when you have to choose between what's best for your daughter, and what will keep your husband happy, you are obligated to prioritize the daughter you've been given to care for. She was the vulnerable one who needs protection and an advocate in the world while growing up. Your husband is a grown man who is not in any way suffering from your daughter's choices.", "NTA, at all.
