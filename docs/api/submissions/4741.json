Of course he is going to whinge about being the victim. But this is gross. NTA", "My exact thinking! Definitely NTA because I feel like even if OP didn\u2019t report, someone else eventually would and possibly have gone after him for his job over it.", "You mean it\u2019s probably something he does *to* everyone?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Randomly shoving our religion into people's faces will not get them to join the church. It will turn them away. They will see us as harassers. See someone by the food Pantry by the church? Invite them to coffee and donuts. Someone getting medicine delivered? Absolutely not. They are their representing COMPANY. And in case you have forgotten, THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE IS A REAL FEDERAL LAW.", "And so are you.", "Nobody cares if you're wearing a cross because that's on YOU. Keep your crap off OTHER people's stuff. You're not supposed to tamper with customers' packages.", "Yeah I thought that too. Like, when I have prescriptions delivered usually they come with little inserts with the prescription number and dosing instruction stuff on them in case you mess up the label on the bottle, extended lists of side effects, stuff like that. I would be *pissed* if Rev. Deliveryman's staples ended up messing those up.", "Yeah like, there's probably at least a few people who might not use that delivery service again because they'd be afraid of getting that guy again and him getting more obnoxiously pushy with the proselytizing the next time around. I know that's certainly been a problem in my area.", "This. I\u2019d wanna know for sure.\n\nI think you did the right thing. You didn\u2019t sign up for delivery and doctrine. \n\nNTA", "I think that was the real motivation from the beginning: to gain brownie points for being \"persecuted for his faith.\" (I can't even imagine how his actions would do anything but further alienate those who aren't already Xtians.)

You see more politics than anything and speak on that I however do not. That is why we are completely different my dude!", "And I sure will be!", "You may feel that way, but you can't tell other people that they must feel the same way.  People have trauma about religion -- as OP mentioned -- and even being handed a pamphlet can feel similar to community pressure (\"hi, we're reminding you that you are doomed unless you join our sect!\").  And then there's people who belong to traditionally-persecuted minority religions in the U.S., like Judaism or Islam.  Absolutely do NOT tell someone who's Jewish that Christians shoving pamphlets at them is \"not pressuring\".\n\nHanding out pamphlets IS proselytizing. It may be a low-key version of it, but it's still an indication that they think you \"need\" to be exposed to their religious beliefs so that perhaps you will be won over and thus be saved.  It is, at its root, a gesture of disrespect towards your own beliefs (or right to a lack of belief).\n\nIt does NOT belong in the workplace.", "What I find funny is that people like the delivery guy would have a fit if a Muslim or Buddhist did the same to them.", "[removed]", "It takes zero seconds not to hand them out.", "[removed]"]}
