I use a national pharmacy chain that has same day delivery through their app. Last week I needed to get my birth control refilled, so I made the request and got a text that my driver was on my way about two hours later.\n\nThe driver (probably mid-30sM) arrived, handed me my bag, I thanked him, and that was that (I was trying to stop my dog from getting out so I honestly didn't give him any space to talk to me if he was going to try to do that). When he handed me my bag, I noticed that there were two business cards stapled to it, one of them an ad for a local church, and another with a typed out message that said he \"prays for everyone he delivers to and that he would be praying for me today\". \n\nHonestly, this made me pretty uncomfortable and I really don't think it was appropriate. For one, I'm wondering if it had something to do with the fact that I was getting birth control, although admittedly the bag was sealed and I don't know that he could see that through the app. Secondly, the community where I grew up (not where I currently live) is deeply religious and conservative and I have some trauma associated with it. Overall, I just think religion should stay out of things like this entirely, no matter what the religion is. \n\nI was really hesitant to report him as I think service workers get a lot of bullshit, but it was bothering me so I decided to just fill out a complaint on the app. I made sure to mention the delivery was fine and that the driver was nice and I didn't want him to get in trouble, just that I thought the business cards were inappropriate. The rep said they would investigate and I didn't really think about it until today when I was cleaning out my desk and I found the ad for the church. I looked them up on Facebook and there was a post from the delivery driver. He said he was under investigation and his account was suspended for a few days, although it's been reinstated since, and that he thought I had treated him unfairly. A lot of people from the church were responding saying I was the AH and that they were praying for me (lol). I feel really bad that I cost him a few day's pay.

He should have known  he was risking being reprimanded by doing that and chose to still do it anyway.

(Not saying you were embarrased at all)\n\nYou have the right to believe or not believe. He has the right to believe or not believe.

If you worked together in person, he\u2019d be in HR faster than you could say fuck off.

He crossed a line that he had no business crossing, and his action absolutely were inappropriate.  You have nothing to feel bad about.\n\nDeep down he probably loves it.

I appreciate you standing up for your fellow human beings who have never imposed their personal beliefs on uninterested strangers, and simply want the same courtesy extended to them.  Thanks.", "NTA - He was trying to force personal beliefs through a service that was completely unrelated. Extremely uncomfortable and uncalled for, he has NO right. If he wants to go around being a missionary then he needs to quit his pharmacy driver job and do that, you deserve to obtain your medication without religion being pushed on you. It\u2019s one thing to have someone tell you they\u2019re praying for you, weird and uncomfortable but I just blankly stare at them and say okay, but stapling the cards is next level. You did the right thing reporting him, he should be punished for this. He\u2019s soliciting through a private business which is illegal in most countries as well. How creepy.", "NTA\n\nWait\u2026 did he actually name you!?  Because that might call for another reporting.", "Last I checked, a meal/delivery/etc shouldn't carry with it religious weight just cause you want the comfort of receiving the item in question in your own home.\n\nNTA.

His message wasn't offensive at all. As he stated, he prays for everyone. That's just his way, like many religious folks, of being saying \"have a great day,\" their way of being thankful, etc. You definitely blew it out of proportion. \n\nBtw, I'm atheist. When I have people tell me, \"I'll pray for you,\" or \"Have a blessed day,\" I just say thanks and move on.", "I have people constantly telling me to have a blessed day or give me religious pamphlets at work, I just ignore it or throw them out soft yta", "ESH - He shouldn't be including advertisements from his church and stamping them on deliveries. That's unprofessional but he didn't include one those terrible fake $100 bills telling people they are sinning and going to hell. Also the note he left had a kind message in it not a preachy one. \n\nI think reporting him and getting him in trouble is a bit over the top. That's messing with someone's lively hood over something that wasn't meant to be preachy or malicious.  I would have tossed the two business cards in the trash and not given them a second thought and gone about my day. \n\nI'm also saying this as someone who has a lot of religious trauma and really does not like most of anything to do with christians or christianity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Which in turn can reflect if people use that company again, or write bad review or in extreme circumstances sue.\n\nIts more like if you went to a restaurant and had a bad waiter. Maybe the other servers, the cooks, and owners were all nice and hard working, but you didn\u2019t interact  with them.

If the owner doesn\u2019t know this server is rude then he can\u2019t fix it and continues to lose money.\n\nThat\u2019s like what happens when a driver does something like put religious material on deliveries. It could upset some people(I know not you, your better at being able to move past it but others aren\u2019t) enough to stop using it, etc. That\u2019s why business have rules about that sort of thing. They don\u2019t want to be judge/lose money  based on one employee taking liberties with their job to preach religion.

I was there because I needed medical treatment, not to be prayed over. \n\nI changed insurance companies at the next chance so that I could use a secular hospital that would respect my beliefs."]}
