I use a national pharmacy chain that has same day delivery through their app. Last week I needed to get my birth control refilled, so I made the request and got a text that my driver was on my way about two hours later.\n\nThe driver (probably mid-30sM) arrived, handed me my bag, I thanked him, and that was that (I was trying to stop my dog from getting out so I honestly didn't give him any space to talk to me if he was going to try to do that). When he handed me my bag, I noticed that there were two business cards stapled to it, one of them an ad for a local church, and another with a typed out message that said he \"prays for everyone he delivers to and that he would be praying for me today\". \n\nHonestly, this made me pretty uncomfortable and I really don't think it was appropriate. For one, I'm wondering if it had something to do with the fact that I was getting birth control, although admittedly the bag was sealed and I don't know that he could see that through the app. Secondly, the community where I grew up (not where I currently live) is deeply religious and conservative and I have some trauma associated with it. Overall, I just think religion should stay out of things like this entirely, no matter what the religion is. \n\nI was really hesitant to report him as I think service workers get a lot of bullshit, but it was bothering me so I decided to just fill out a complaint on the app. I made sure to mention the delivery was fine and that the driver was nice and I didn't want him to get in trouble, just that I thought the business cards were inappropriate. The rep said they would investigate and I didn't really think about it until today when I was cleaning out my desk and I found the ad for the church. I looked them up on Facebook and there was a post from the delivery driver. He said he was under investigation and his account was suspended for a few days, although it's been reinstated since, and that he thought I had treated him unfairly. A lot of people from the church were responding saying I was the AH and that they were praying for me (lol). I feel really bad that I cost him a few day's pay.

I\u2019m a delivery driver(specifically usps) and we\u2019re told that when we are in uniform we can\u2019t express political or religious beliefs onto costumers or fellow employees. (Apart from wearing head coverings or cross or star Of David necklace , things like  that) but it is made clear that we can not push it on others cause it is inappropriate. We can when outside the uniform but by accepting the job we agreed not to when representing the usps. \n\nHe crossed a line even if he thought it was harmless and went against his companies policy (guessing since he was investigated). He should have known  he was risking being reprimanded by doing that and chose to still do it anyway.   All you did was point it out, but it was his choice to break the rules and take the risk.", "NTA. \n\nThere probably is a rule against altering deliveries. \nThere probably is a rule against promoting anything that is not company dictated.\n\nEven if he puts those on every single delivery, the juxtaposition is that he is praying for you because of your birth control. That's unacceptable for a delivery. \n\nThat could mortify someone who is too embarrassed to buy them in person into not ordering them again. (Not saying you were embarrased at all)\n\nYou have the right to believe or not believe. He has the right to believe or not believe. But if in choosing to promote his religion through his job (not part of a church) gets him in trouble, that's his problem. Those are the consequences of his actions.\n\nTruthfully, you tried to raise a concern without getting him fired. That was very kind.", "NTA.\n\nYou're paying for the delivery, not his proselytizing", "NTA\n\nHe should know better than to bring his personal beliefs to work, or force them on unsuspecting strangers. Any trouble he does get in is more to do with the service's policy than you", "NTA. It\u2019s not his place, it\u2019s not his job, and it\u2019s not his business. Stapling that card of his to *your* delivery was extremely unprofessional and rude.", "NTA. I\u2019m a Christian who is devoted to her faith, I don\u2019t think what this man did was appropriate. You shouldn\u2019t be discussing religion or politics at work. I doubt he gave you the cards because you had ordered birth control though. I think this is something he does for everyone", "NTA, I hate when people do this stuff. It's so presumptive and rude. He should be worrying about your packages, not your soul.", "NTA.  If you worked together in person, he\u2019d be in HR faster than you could say fuck off.  Religion in a secular workplace is completely inappropriate, and he should not be using his job to preach to unwitting birth control users, and yes, that is a factor here.  It feels like a judgement at best, and an invasion of privacy at worst.  He needs to learn propriety.", "NTA\n\n\nA note saying he was wishing all his customers a healthy and happy holiday season is a nice gesture. \n\nTrying to recruit members for his church is way out of line.", "NTA. Unless you work for the church, as a service provider your own religion, ideology and views are your own and not your customers.", "NTA. If it was acceptable, he wouldn\u2019t have been suspended.", "NTA\n\n> this made me pretty uncomfortable and I really don't think it was appropriate\n\n#It is WILDLY inappropriate!", "NTA. Although I don't agree with you snooping on him afterwards. What he did was unnacceptable, and not only for \"religious\" reasons, but for using work time/resources to the benefit of other jobs or organisations.\n\nEdit: a word", "NTA.  He crossed a line that he had no business crossing, and his action absolutely were inappropriate.  You have nothing to feel bad about.\n\nDeep down he probably loves it.  He gets to play martyr for being the righteous Christian proselytizer.  I'm sure the entire episode as he described it on FB is garnering all the attention he craves.\n\nYou didn't overreact.  I appreciate you standing up for your fellow human beings who have never imposed their personal beliefs on uninterested strangers, and simply want the same courtesy extended to them.  Thanks.", "NTA - He was trying to force personal beliefs through a service that was completely unrelated. Extremely uncomfortable and uncalled for, he has NO right. If he wants to go around being a missionary then he needs to quit his pharmacy driver job and do that, you deserve to obtain your medication without religion being pushed on you. It\u2019s one thing to have someone tell you they\u2019re praying for you, weird and uncomfortable but I just blankly stare at them and say okay, but stapling the cards is next level. You did the right thing reporting him, he should be punished for this. He\u2019s soliciting through a private business which is illegal in most countries as well. How creepy.", "NTA\n\nWait\u2026 did he actually name you!?  Because that might call for another reporting.", "Last I checked, a meal/delivery/etc shouldn't carry with it religious weight just cause you want the comfort of receiving the item in question in your own home.\n\nNTA. He can absolutely get in trouble for doing that though, depending on the business.", "NTA. He was inspropiate, he dont Lost the job, only a cuo of days and its all his fault. If was another person no so nice like you, he was Lost his job.", "I hate it when people feel the need to shove their religion down people's throats. You aren't an asshole. He is. That was far from professional.", "You may be on the fast track to hell but definitely NTA\n\n /s", "YTA. He has no way of knowing what's inside your bag. The driver is just there to deliver it. His message wasn't offensive at all. As he stated, he prays for everyone. That's just his way, like many religious folks, of being saying \"have a great day,\" their way of being thankful, etc. You definitely blew it out of proportion. \n\nBtw, I'm atheist. When I have people tell me, \"I'll pray for you,\" or \"Have a blessed day,\" I just say thanks and move on.", "I have people constantly telling me to have a blessed day or give me religious pamphlets at work, I just ignore it or throw them out soft yta", "ESH - He shouldn't be including advertisements from his church and stamping them on deliveries. That's unprofessional but he didn't include one those terrible fake $100 bills telling people they are sinning and going to hell. Also the note he left had a kind message in it not a preachy one. \n\nI think reporting him and getting him in trouble is a bit over the top. That's messing with someone's lively hood over something that wasn't meant to be preachy or malicious.  I would have tossed the two business cards in the trash and not given them a second thought and gone about my day. \n\nI'm also saying this as someone who has a lot of religious trauma and really does not like most of anything to do with christians or christianity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not something to make an issue out of.  \n\nBut he didn't say it as a nice gesture. He stapled an ad for a church and stapled something saying he was praying for her. That's now beyond someone saying have a blessed day. That's recruiting.  Which he shouldn't be doing while representing a company without the company's permission.\n\nAnd I agree he probably didn't know what was in it and it's happenstance that what OP ordered was something that is controversial in most religions.
