The same idea, that real men wouldnt care if they touched pads or not, could have been presented without targeting a likely fragile area for a member of your partners family-for instance that well either hes wrong that it shouldnt concern men or he thinks his son is failing as a man for being concerned for you, or that that means that men should value their masculinity over people they care about, even if it was gross (its not) touching gross stuff is no worse than taking out garbage. Or even that its just an old fashioned view. But targeting his masculinity is a called shot thats cruel, seems intended to hurt, especially when you will have to keep interacting with him, which is kind of assholish and short sighted.\n\nI would say maybe hes worse, but if you like your boyfriend and your boyfriend likes his dad, then an apology may be very useful to just make interacting with them go easier in future by appearing as less of an asshole to the dad.", "NTA.

It's not progressive, just part of being good to those you care about.", "ESH. I smell exaggeration. A 30 minute rant before \u201cstorming off\u201d is astronomically unlikely. \n\nHe sounds like an exaggerated version of a middle-aged guy who still has 1950\u2019s era ideas about gender roles, while you parsed your participation here in a way you thought made you look like you held the high ground in morality and basic intelligence, but that failed when you claimed your response was \u201cclearly he\u2019s not a real man if he can\u2019t buy some fucking pads\u201d.\n\nThe only thing clear here is that in this instance, if it actually happened as you wrote it, YBA.

Guess what I go and buy for my wife every few weeks?\n\nHaving said that, you hit a mosquito with a sledgehammer on this one. His attitude was outdated, but you didn\u2019t need to challenge his masculinity.", "OP, I think you can agree that you insulted your  boyfriend's father. Your boyfriend's father has a concept of appropriate male behavior that is different from yours. He may possibly be a nice guy overall, but simply believes that women's periods are something that only women should deal with. \n\nYou have managed to alienate him rather dramatically & completely with a few simple sentences. Asking questions & discussing his attitudes might have led him to a different understanding. I'll leave it to you to decide if you were the AH.\n\nEdit to add: Derision and name-calling does not foster communication or understanding. Why did you feel the need to insult your boyfriend's father?", "\u201cThings are awkward now.\u201d You think?! \ud83d\ude02 YTA", "YTA you were a guest in their home. You may disagree with his views, but they way you called him out was inappropriate. How does his view on pads affect you at all??? His son is ok with buying them. That's all that matters. \n\nYou were rude. Flat out.", "ESH but you're right, he isn't a real man. If he was a real man he'd be compassionate and do anything to assist in his wife or daughter being comfortable. It's hard enough having to deal with a period let alone deal with one of the people in your life aren't willing to grab you toiletries. I mean a guy who goes out of his way? To do something for his partner? That's hot and masculine. Truth hurts.", "ESH. Your comment about your boyfriend's dad not being a \"real man\" was a bit harsh. Yeah, his attitude towards buying pads is outdated and pretty ridiculous, but calling his masculinity into question was a low blow. It's understandable that you were annoyed, especially with the whole period situation making things extra stressful, but snapping back like that escalated the situation.\n\nOn the flip side, his reaction to your boyfriend buying pads is pretty laughable. It's 2024, not the 1950s. Guys can buy pads. It's not a big deal. His bragging about never having bought pads as if it's some badge of honour is pretty silly.\n\nSo, while his views are definitely out of touch, and it's great that your boyfriend is more progressive, it might've been better to roll your eyes internally and let it slide. Or maybe a more chill response like, \"Times change, and it's no big deal these days.\" But hey, we've all said stuff in the heat of the moment.\n\nApologising could smooth things over, but it's up to you. It might help to clear the air, but it's also okay to stand by your belief that there's nothing wrong with a guy buying pads. Just maybe without the \"real man\" jab next time.", "Nta", "I wouldn't say he's worse, I don't think you need to clarify a 'worse' in this situation, but OP attacked someone's gender identity and that's absolutely not okay. \n\nI hope OP is ready for this relationship to be on the rocks, because a heated argument for thirty minutes with his dad after attacking his masculinity is not - for both parties - going to disappear with an apology.", "Right?!? OP you're not progressive if you think that the appropriate response to sexism is to attack someone's sense of their gendered self. Attack the ideas, not the person.", "They were laughing about OP and her boyfriend and he said his son is not a real man. Why is that ok?", "Agree and I like that metaphor.

They laughed and said the younger generation are so progressive. The dad just said that he personally didn't have anything to do with them as they didn't concern men in his opinion. There was no mocking either of them, there was no having a go at her for making him get them, there were no insults.", "Exactly.", "the FIL said something outdated and mildly sexist, OP instantly went for something FIL obviously holds at the core of his personhood. \n\nOP brought a nuke to fistfight. \n\nAlso, what do you mean by \"few\"? Are you meaning to say \"view\"?", "What next? A real woman wouldn\u2019t have asked her boyfriend she would have brace herself and drove to get her own pads! Like a real woman!!!\nPlease this was a ridiculous, outadated but commonly shared between people of past generation idea, that got blown out of proportion by OP. What her insults generated?\nWill he go now buy pads for his wife now? Nope, probably cause also the woman has passed the needs for them.

I don\u2019t think so.\nBut for sure she ruined the relationship with her boyfriend\u2019s family.", "she will be a \"real woman\" who probably will never be invited into his home because she couldn't express her views in a civilized manner. not every time someone says something you disagree with you get to insult them.", "FIL said real men dont touch pads.\n\nOP said real men tuch pads.\n\n\nWhy is FIL opinion totally OK and OPs opinion is absolutely disgusting and its Ok to laugh about OP?", "This man laughed about his son and his girlfriend and called his son \u201enot a real man\u201c\n\nOP said, she as an other opinion on that.\n\nWhy is OP an asshole for that?", "Account created yesterday.

It\u2019s ridiculous the shame girls are taught about basic bodily functions. The boyfriend\u2019s father was shaming both her and her bf for needing to purchase the pads. \n\nNow the people in the comments are shaming her for standing up for herself. Newsflash, just because it\u2019s the guy\u2019s house, it doesn\u2019t mean he gets to blatantly act like there\u2019s something wrong with the boyfriend buying pads.

Periods happen to almost every biological female for decades. Saying he went to the store for pads isn\u2019t a big deal, it\u2019s certainly not something out of left field to say when talking to your boyfriend\u2019s parents. \n\nThey were out of line though. If they want to have antiquated and harmful views then they can keep them to themselves. I personally don\u2019t find a problem with calling out and fighting back against misogynist bullshit with targeted hits at their precious masculinity.", "NTA\n\n>they exchanged looks with each other before breaking into laughter about how progressive kids of today are and that some private woman things should remain between women.\n\nThis reads like *progressive kids* is a euphemism for \"woke\" with plausible deniability built in. \n\nMenstruation is a private woman thing that should remain between women? The mom has her own internalized misogyny to contend with. \n\nWhat \"real man\" pops off for 30 minutes about something like this? \n\nNTA and don't apologize. Being cOnSeRvAtIvE isn't a free pass to act like a jerk towards others. He knew exactly what he was doing and what the two possible outcomes were. Either you'd stay quiet and he could feel smug about \"owning a lib\" or you would react. Because you reacted (and swore!) he (they) got to go into gaslighting mode to make him the victim and you the mean progressive girl. \n\nYou didn't take things too far, your boyfriend's dad did. He needed reminding that \"free speech\" can come with consequences. In this case his ignorant and outdated views, which he's so proud of, got his manhood questioned. \n\nPersonally, I'd have gone for the jugular after dad admitted he's \"never even touched a pack\".", "NTA. I think your reaction to being shamed when you feel like shit was very understandable.

I\u2019ve been beaten and starved. Stabbed and shot at. I dare anyone to question my manhood because I\u2019m helping someone I love. Your boyfriend\u2019s father is a jerk.

Could it have been avoided, yes. But it isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s job to placate a man who won\u2019t even buy his wife pads because it\u2019s not masculine. Anyone saying that you attacked his masculinity needs to understand that those comments would barely affect anyone who is actually secure in their masculinity. He instigated it with his outdated views, was inseccently rude about it to a guest in his house, and then overreacted when he was slightly challenged. \n\nAnyone saying ESH values placative \u201cpeace\u201d more than a woman feeling comfortable to voice her opinions", "NTA. I don't believe in coddling outdated and harmful stereotypes because someine is older or related to someone you like.

But being a man who takes pride in refusing to touch feminine hygiene products when they have a wife and daughters, yeah that\u2019s not it.", "Ok, thanks.", "they asked where their son was and she told them", "But the glass table the mosquito is sitting on doesn\u2019t.", "So big and manly and masculine and yet repulsed by a bit of blood lmao.", "Well hopefully they are but a guy like that will probably be salty about the \"not a real man\" forever lol. Good on you for those boundaries, It's good to set them soon, it's so hard to fake smile through so much bullshit with my in laws I can't burn bridges with them yet but one day I'll snap too I swear.", "Problem is, you don't do it in this manner.  You insinuate it in such a way as to make them reach the conclusion on their own. \n\nNo one is going to change their mind if you just say they're not manly, they'll see it as an attack and just disregard what you say. \n\nIf you get them to reach the conclusion on their own, then it becomes their idea and they can reconcile it easier. \n\nThe better way for OP to approach it would be to say something like \"well I'm glad you raised your son in such a way that he cares more for me than for the ridiculous societal taboos surrounding feminine hygiene products\".\n\nOr some such.", "Is this a serious question? The only response you can think of in your head is to attack the masculinity of the guy who\u2019s house you\u2019re staying at? \n\n\u201cI think men should take care of their girlfriend no matter what it looks like\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful that your son loves me enough to go to the store no matter what you think about it\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the big deal in running to the store to help someone you love?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different times now, periods aren\u2019t as taboo as they used to be\u201d\n\nHaven\u2019t even had my morning coffee yet and it took me 15 seconds to think of 4 better responses lol.", "Where is the disrespect, tho?", "> 'How dare you mention his gender when he specifically made a point to express that periods are shameful and should be spoken of only by women because it's a women's issue????'\n\nCompletely fucking agree. This whole thing is so absurd. We know women are often held to a higher social standard, and these comments are really showing that in action. People act like sexism is dead and gone and like women are treated like equals now, but no. The pressure to keep your head down, be agreeable, tolerate disrespect, accept sexism and dehumanizing views from family members, ONLY if you are woman, is just absurd.\n\n\"Being a real man is actually showing empathy and being confident in yourself enough to buy period products\" is a COMPLETELY normal, and extremely relevant and valid rebuttal. He didn't understand her point and instead took it personally, but that's not HER fault, and you shouldn't avoid countering sexism and pointing out its hypocrisies just to avoid hurting men's feelings.\n\nThe only way women don't get tons of shit in situations like this is if they're literally 1000000% perfect in every single way. Every single word has to be exactly perfectly phrased, and she must still have an air of agreeability and kindness in her voice, or she'll be called an asshole. Never mind if she's defending herself, or has a right to be angry.\n\nThis is just what the most modern version of sexism looks like, in places where women technically have equal rights under the law. We are still shamed for not being agreeable, polite, literally perfect. We are still pressured into being quiet and accepting misery and dehumanization into our lives. We are STILL called assholes for defending ourselves -- and then people wonder \"why do women date abusive men instead of breaking up??\" as if it exists in a vacuum -- shit like this entire comment section is why! Women are constantly made to feel unreasonable and ridiculous and straight up called *assholes* for standing up for themselves, and people think that doesn't affect women in other ways??!\n\nI hope this shit changes in my lifetime, but honestly, it just feels like we're sliding backwards and getting worse and worse in how we treat women.", "Never allowing her as a guest again is definitely the best way for dad to prove how masculine he is.", "\\*bear.", "I would have said he went to the store to get me pads to literally anyone. It\u2019s not baiting or antagonizing to be on your period. It\u2019s also not sone shameful secret. If I had a blister and sent bf to the store to get supplies for my blister I would also say that, there is no difference lol", "In this case, not even a bit of blood, just mention of *a box of pads*. \n\nImagine having pride in the fact you never touched a *box*.  We can probably guess how many diapers he's changed.", "honestly why would he invite her? who needs the headache. his son can deal with her, OPs not the dad's problem.", "Where did I say \"FIL opinion totally OK\" and \"OPs opinion is absolutely disgusting and its Ok to laugh about OP?\"\n\nI don't understand why you're getting upvotes when you are so very obviously strawmanning me.", ">FIL said real men dont touch pads.\n\nNo, he said he has never bought pads, and never will because it doesn't concern men. \n\nYou're adding words where there are none and spinning what he said to have a new meaning. \n\n>Why is FIL opinion totally OK and OPs opinion is absolutely disgusting and its Ok to laugh about OP?\n\nIt isn't necessarily ok, no one said OP's was disgusting, and no one is laughing at OP.", "It doesn't matter", "Another example, is if someone said their partner was going to the store to buy diapers, no one would say \"ugh don't bring up gross things while people are eating.\" If it's socially acceptable to say that, then getting pads should not be taboo. The only reason it's treated that way is because of ***misogyny***.", "And being so insecure about your masculinity that anybody even lightly questioning it warrants a blow up. Fuck off. I can't stand guys who can't regulate their emotions, I've never reacted that way to anything past my toddler years lmao, does acting like a toddler make you a man?", "Civility? Respect? Diplomacy? Emotional maturity?", "That\u2019s COMPLETELY different , how is hearing about your siblings sexual experiences in great detail at all similar to hearing someone is on their period? She didn\u2019t even go into detail", "Those are not equivalent lol", "> it\u2019s not that deep maybe some people just don\u2019t wanna hear their son\u2019s girlfriend announce that she\u2019s on her period.\n> \n> \n\nShould she never mention when she has a cold too? How about when she needs to use the bathroom should she instead say she is going to the laundry or just 'another room' so they don't know she's performing a bodily function. Should she never ask to be passed a tissue in case they note she has a runny nose?", "But no one was discussing periods. Mentioning where the boyfriend is in no way constitutes a \"discussion.\" \n\nIf anything, the boyfriend's PARENTS made it into a discussion by criticizing the younger generation's practices and saying that the father was more of a man for not being responsive to his wife's needs.", "I\u2019d let it rest here, except you\u2019re completely missing the point. It\u2019s not about who the dad is, how old he is, or how right or wrong he is. He\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s part of my judgement. \n\nIt\u2019s about the severity and context. She decided to escalate the situation from a shitty comment into an all out verbal brawl, and do it at HIS HOUSE sitting at HIS TABLE. My whole mosquito metaphor wasn\u2019t about the mosquito; it was about the hammer. Both a fly swatter and sledgehammer will kill the mosquito. The hammer will damage a hell of a lot more in the process, though. And now her boyfriend is left to manage this whole mess. As the actual member of the family, it was really for him to challenge his dad. OP should have kept her peace FOR THE TIME BEING and talked to him about it.", "Of course no one wants to hear about bodily functions while eating! But saying her bf went to pick up pads is not the same as describing her period or talking about being on it. Like picking up pads from the store is very normal and while no one wants to hear the gritty details of ANY bodily function it\u2019s bad imo that women feel they have to hide any evidence of their period. \n\nI feel a good comparison is that let\u2019s say you weren\u2019t feeling hungry at breakfast because you\u2019ve been having diarrhea. No, you shouldn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019ve been having really bad runny poops so don\u2019t want anymore bacon\u201d but maybe \u201coh I\u2019ve been having some stomach troubles\u201d is fine. Similarly I think it would be ok to mention period related things that aren\u2019t descriptive of what\u2019s going on. So \u201cI\u2019m anxious because I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to bleed through my tampon all over the chair\u201d would be gross yeah, but saying \u201cit\u2019s my time of the month so bf is running to the store\u201d seems totally fine. We talk about bodily functions all the time in our lives and there are ways to make those discussions less gross. I feel that periods are often not given the same grace in that regard as other things that we all deal with.", "She didn\u2019t describe her bodily functions, she said he went to buy pads, how is this any different to saying he went to get toilet paper? Do you seriously think any normal person would react that way to being told someone is getting toilet paper? I\u2019d guess not, it\u2019s equally weird to get that riled up after being told someone is getting pads", "Clearly you dont have kids. I have 3. Morning poops are pretty standard table talk. Usually by the end of the meal they have had either a burp or fart contest as well. My 13yo daughter just started her period (poor girl got it new years eve), and we all learned about it at the table. My husband just said \"man, that sucks\" and we moved on.", "Why tf would I say I have a cold. You act like it's a crazy taboo thing for someone to be on there period it's not. Grow up and get over it.", "Or toilet paper. For real. \n\nIt's just groceries, guys. She wasn't changing her pad on the table.", "Where exacley he said his son is a lesser man because he cares about his partners? Guys you are building your own personal and valid! struggles and life injustice into this situation. From one comment where he state he never touched pads and this things don\u2019t concern him as a man. You are building a castle. Yes her period do not concern him. And unless his wife felt the need to share it (which clearly she didn\u2019t cause grown up with same views) he still do not concern him.\nThe problem will have arisen if he forbid his son to go buy them. Do you understand the difference between forbidding people to their on existence and beliefs and having different one while still being ok and let you practice your own and be yourself?"]}
