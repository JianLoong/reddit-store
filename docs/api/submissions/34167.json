His mother calls me down for breakfast and now I'm sitting at the dining table with his parents. His dad asks where my boyfriend is and I tell him he's gone to the stores to get me pads. Both their faces dropped and they exchanged looks with each other before breaking into laughter about how progressive kids of today are and that some private woman things should remain between women. His dad then said he's never even touched a pack of pads in all his years despite growing up with girls and being married for 40 years and never will because it doesn't concern men. Slightly pissed off, on top my already bad mood, I decide to respond (was quiet until now) and said that it was funny how he said that with so much pride because then clearly he's not a real man if he can't just buy some fucking pads. After trying to stare me down he blew up shouting about how dare I say he wasn't a real man and ranted for 30 minutes about how much of a real man he was (and yet you can't even buy it some pads?) before storming off. \n\nThings are now awkward and I'm contemplating apologizing and leaving to make things better.

His viewpoints are trash but I would have just ignored it and kept moving especially since you are staying at his parents place. I feel like the reaction was just too much", "ESH. He carries the generational weight of thinking that certain products are impure because of menstruation being ritually unclean and unfit for men, which is awful and fucked up on a sociological cultural level.\n\nYou sniped at him aiming at a location that that kind of worldview makes into a fragile and easily damageable area. The same idea, that real men wouldnt care if they touched pads or not, could have been presented without targeting a likely fragile area for a member of your partners family-for instance that well either hes wrong that it shouldnt concern men or he thinks his son is failing as a man for being concerned for you, or that that means that men should value their masculinity over people they care about, even if it was gross (its not) touching gross stuff is no worse than taking out garbage. Or even that its just an old fashioned view. But targeting his masculinity is a called shot thats cruel, seems intended to hurt, especially when you will have to keep interacting with him, which is kind of assholish and short sighted.\n\nI would say maybe hes worse, but if you like your boyfriend and your boyfriend likes his dad, then an apology may be very useful to just make interacting with them go easier in future by appearing as less of an asshole to the dad.", "NTA. He definitely has some huge insecurities. If they didn\u2019t want to hear your unwanted opinion on the matter perhaps they shouldn\u2019t have given you an unwanted opinion in the first place.", "ESH\nHim, for is outdated ideas.\nYou, because you can\u2019t express your ideas in a proper manner.", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriends father has some antiquated ideas that you don't agree with (for valid reasons), but ultimately don't impact you since your boyfriend obviously doesn't share his views. You responded to this by attacking him where you knew it would offend someone who has demonstrated mild misogynistic behavior the most. You attacked his masculinity. \n\nIt wasn't a great call. He's your loved one's parent, and you are a guest in his home. You could have let this go. Or you could have expressed more mild disagreement without attacking him. \"I understand some people can be uncomfortable with it, but I really appreciate how considerate and helpful your son is when I need something. \"\n\nYou owe him an apology for the personal nature of how you handled the disagreement even though your feelings were valid.", "Just leave", "YTA, yeah his ideas were outdated, but they didn't seem to have a problem with his son treating it differently than he did, just stated you were both progressive. I don't see why that would piss you off enough to swear at him and tell him he isn't a real man.", "ESH. Yeah they have shitty values and obviously aren't afraid to share them, but that doesn't really excuse you going for him like that.", "He said a slightly stupid opinion and you disrespected his entire identity to his face in his own house. If someone close to you told you \"you're not a real woman\" because you said something a bit stupid like \"my boyfriend should fix my car for me\", in your own home, you'd probably burst into tears and kick them out.

But you can also say that without insulting them. I also very much doubt he was yelling for a half hour.", "NTA- I've bought feminine hygiene stuff for my daughter (and even for women I was dating) plenty of times. It's not progressive, just part of being good to those you care about.", "ESH. I smell exaggeration. A 30 minute rant before \u201cstorming off\u201d is astronomically unlikely. \n\nHe sounds like an exaggerated version of a middle-aged guy who still has 1950\u2019s era ideas about gender roles, while you parsed your participation here in a way you thought made you look like you held the high ground in morality and basic intelligence, but that failed when you claimed your response was \u201cclearly he\u2019s not a real man if he can\u2019t buy some fucking pads\u201d.\n\nThe only thing clear here is that in this instance, if it actually happened as you wrote it, YBA. Yep. Both of you. You just as big of one as he is.", "ESH. I\u2019m a man in my 40\u2019s and I do all the shopping for my family. Guess what I go and buy for my wife every few weeks?\n\nHaving said that, you hit a mosquito with a sledgehammer on this one. His attitude was outdated, but you didn\u2019t need to challenge his masculinity.", "OP, I think you can agree that you insulted your  boyfriend's father. Your boyfriend's father has a concept of appropriate male behavior that is different from yours. He may possibly be a nice guy overall, but simply believes that women's periods are something that only women should deal with. \n\nYou have managed to alienate him rather dramatically & completely with a few simple sentences. Asking questions & discussing his attitudes might have led him to a different understanding. I'll leave it to you to decide if you were the AH.\n\nEdit to add: Derision and name-calling does not foster communication or understanding. Why did you feel the need to insult your boyfriend's father?", "\u201cThings are awkward now.\u201d You think?! \ud83d\ude02 YTA", "YTA you were a guest in their home. You may disagree with his views, but they way you called him out was inappropriate. How does his view on pads affect you at all??? His son is ok with buying them. That's all that matters. \n\nYou were rude. Flat out.", "ESH but you're right, he isn't a real man. If he was a real man he'd be compassionate and do anything to assist in his wife or daughter being comfortable. It's hard enough having to deal with a period let alone deal with one of the people in your life aren't willing to grab you toiletries. I mean a guy who goes out of his way? To do something for his partner? That's hot and masculine. Truth hurts.", "ESH. Your comment about your boyfriend's dad not being a \"real man\" was a bit harsh. Yeah, his attitude towards buying pads is outdated and pretty ridiculous, but calling his masculinity into question was a low blow. It's understandable that you were annoyed, especially with the whole period situation making things extra stressful, but snapping back like that escalated the situation.\n\nOn the flip side, his reaction to your boyfriend buying pads is pretty laughable. It's 2024, not the 1950s. Guys can buy pads. It's not a big deal. His bragging about never having bought pads as if it's some badge of honour is pretty silly.\n\nSo, while his views are definitely out of touch, and it's great that your boyfriend is more progressive, it might've been better to roll your eyes internally and let it slide. Or maybe a more chill response like, \"Times change, and it's no big deal these days.\" But hey, we've all said stuff in the heat of the moment.\n\nApologising could smooth things over, but it's up to you. It might help to clear the air, but it's also okay to stand by your belief that there's nothing wrong with a guy buying pads. Just maybe without the \"real man\" jab next time.", "Nta", "I wouldn't say he's worse, I don't think you need to clarify a 'worse' in this situation, but OP attacked someone's gender identity and that's absolutely not okay. \n\nI hope OP is ready for this relationship to be on the rocks, because a heated argument for thirty minutes with his dad after attacking his masculinity is not - for both parties - going to disappear with an apology.", "Right?!? OP you're not progressive if you think that the appropriate response to sexism is to attack someone's sense of their gendered self. Attack the ideas, not the person.", "They were laughing about OP and her boyfriend and he said his son is not a real man. Why is that ok?", "Agree and I like that metaphor. I'll also add, you don't have to be mean to say what you mean.", "And only because her FIL has a strange few of things, OP is not allowed to tell him her few?\n\nThat sounds ridiculous", "It was not harsh, it was true.\n\nA real man would not talk about that topic like a boy.", "No they didn't. They laughed and said the younger generation are so progressive. The dad just said that he personally didn't have anything to do with them as they didn't concern men in his opinion. There was no mocking either of them, there was no having a go at her for making him get them, there were no insults.", "Exactly.", "the FIL said something outdated and mildly sexist, OP instantly went for something FIL obviously holds at the core of his personhood. \n\nOP brought a nuke to fistfight. \n\nAlso, what do you mean by \"few\"? Are you meaning to say \"view\"?", "What next? A real woman wouldn\u2019t have asked her boyfriend she would have brace herself and drove to get her own pads! Like a real woman!!!\nPlease this was a ridiculous, outadated but commonly shared between people of past generation idea, that got blown out of proportion by OP. What her insults generated?\nWill he go now buy pads for his wife now? Nope, probably cause also the woman has passed the needs for them. Willie he become the paladine of women\u2019s rights after getting insulted? I don\u2019t think so.\nBut for sure she ruined the relationship with her boyfriend\u2019s family.", "she will be a \"real woman\" who probably will never be invited into his home because she couldn't express her views in a civilized manner. not every time someone says something you disagree with you get to insult them.", "FIL said real men dont touch pads.\n\nOP said real men tuch pads.\n\n\nWhy is FIL opinion totally OK and OPs opinion is absolutely disgusting and its Ok to laugh about OP?", "This man laughed about his son and his girlfriend and called his son \u201enot a real man\u201c\n\nOP said, she as an other opinion on that.\n\nWhy is OP an asshole for that?"]}
