I 46M have 3 kids and a foster daughter 8F. Our foster kid has adhd and takes meds for it everyday. Today  while i was making dinner she took her pills in the living room and apparently she dropped her pill while our dog was standing next to her and she didn\u2019t know what to do so she just stood there in shock while our dog ate her medicine like it was candy. When i saw the look on her face and our dog chewing on something i immediately knew what happened but it was too late cause he had already swallowed it. \n\nI was so mad at the fact that she didn\u2019t stop him from eating it and just stood there, we have a pretty big dog but he\u2019s not scary at all so i don\u2019t understand why she couldn\u2019t have stopped him. \nAnd after that i yelled at her like never before and told her that he could die now because of what she had done, and she started crying and i told her to her room. Me and my sons called around to different veterinarians and they said he would be fine and he also was surprisingly . When my wife  found out about how mad i got at her she accused me of being to harsh because shes just a kid. I don\u2019t personally think i owe her an apology when her stupidity could have hurt our dog.

My daughter sometimes doesn\u2019t know how to act in a situation that requires little to no time to think. I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this to her.

If you can't control yourself in the \"heat of the moment\" enough to keep from screaming at a likely previously traumatized child then you don't need to be a foster parent and probably need some anger management therapy.", "Dude- I saw your edit but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll listen. \n\nAs a dog owner, I understand your fear. If my dog ate a pill of any kind that wasn\u2019t prescribed, I\u2019d be freaking out!\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing- IDK how long your foster daughter has been with you, but just because your dog is good natured doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be scared of him. She may be fearful of dogs in general, especially large ones, and she froze in response. She likely thought if she reached down to pick it up, the dog might growl or bite at her.\n\nCalling an 8yo stupid over an accident like this is verbally abusive. \n\nThe correct course of action would have been to stay calm around her, immediately call your vet or poison control, and then after you make sure the dog is okay, gently talk to her about what happened.\n\nInstead, you shamed her, made her feel like an outsider in your home. You owe her a BIG apology. YTA", "YTA. A big dog is often scary to people who aren\u2019t super familiar with it, and kids/non-owners would likely be intimidated by telling a big dog not to eat whatever it pleases. \n\nI\u2019m sure she felt bad about it but instead of helping the dog or understanding that it was an accident, you went off on her. \n\nThat was bad and you should feel bad.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t do it on purpose and it sounds like it happened pretty fast. Kids panic when they know they\u2019ve made a mistake, and sometimes they freeze up like that. Especially if this is your foster daughter, you don\u2019t know what kind of trauma responses she\u2019s had to form. \n\nScreaming at her and flying off the handle, telling her if the dog died it\u2019s her fault\u2026 that\u2019s horrible. A truly horrible thing to do to a child. She made a mistake. She isn\u2019t stupid or malicious. She\u2019s a small child and she made a mistake.\n\nYou should have remained calm, because you were the adult in the situation. You should have called the vet, brought the dog in, whatever, and then had a *calm* conversation with your foster daughter about how important it is to keep medicines/certain foods/whatever out of the dog\u2019s reach because they could hurt the dog. But made it clear that you understood she didn\u2019t mean to do something that could harm the dog.\n\nWhen children make honest mistakes and they\u2019re met with verbal abuse, shaming, screaming, etc. it only exacerbates the problem. This is probably why she panicked and froze in the first place.\n\nWhy are you fostering this child if you\u2019re so quick to lose your temper? Are you this harsh with your biological children? Seriously consider taking some parenting classes, reading some books, etc. do some work on your parenting skills, please.", ">AITA for screaming\n\nYes, YTA. You should be able to handle situations without screaming.", "Screaming at anyone generally means YTA.  Just throwing that out there.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't control your temper then you shouldn't be fostering. Many kids in care come from abused backgrounds and \"yelling at her like never before\" is not a safe environment for her. It was an accident, she is 8, control yourself, you're the adult here.", "YTA - A kid freezing up in an uncomfortable situation is normal for a kid and guess what, if you wanted to build her confidence so that she doesn't freeze up like that in the future, you really shouldn't have yelled. It's actually a very good reaction to not quickly reach your hand in front of a dogs mouth when they are picking something up unless the dog is well trained. This is how dog bites happen even with typically friendly dogs.\n\nIn the future, try to pause and assess the situation fully before reacting. In that situation, you call the vet before freaking out. And going forward, watch the kid take the medication before walking away from you.", "YTA. She\u2019s a kid\u2026. But even if she had been an adult, accidents happen. I dunno what\u2019s wrong with you??? My dog ate some Imodium before that I dropped and all I did was call the vet, a logical next step. I could see being mad if someone was intentionally poisoning your dog but it was an honest mistake.", ">i feel like you guys don\u2019t understand what a stressful and scary situation it was for everyone and i got mad in the heat of the moment\n\nNo, we understand. We also understand that you are an adult and she is 8 YEARS OLD. It was stressful and scary for her -- you can tell by the way she froze up, which is not out of \"stupidity\" but clearly out of being freaked out that she made a mistake and dropped something -- and what you needed to do was HANDLE the situation, not SCREAM AT A CHILD. How did that help? Did it get you calling the vet faster? You need a lesson in empathy and also a lesson in how to handle emergencies responsibly instead of lashing out. YTA", "Yta. She is a CHILD.

I learned tryst from the vet emergency hotline.", "YTA, I do understand your split second reaction was anger but you do owe her an apology. She is 8 years old but she has had to be in traumatic situations in her life and freezing at the moment may very well be a result of trauma. You should apologize but also come up with a better way to take her meds.", "YTA.  She didn't \"give\" your dog her ADHD pills. She dropped a pill on the floor and may not have known how to respond in the moment.  Maybe she has received harsh punishments in the past for dropping things, triggering a trauma response.  Or maybe her unmedicated ADHD brain was trying to decide if it was better to still take a pill that fell on the ground or ask for a new one. Or who knows what else was going on in her 8-year-old brain.  Doesn't matter.  She's 8. You're not.  YTA.  \n\nAnd double YTA for claiming that you don't owe her an apology because \"her stupidity could have hurt our dog.\"  She's not stupid.  She's <scared, traumatized, 8, a kid, oblivious to potential consequences>.

Also you say it's a big dog. Though you might not be scared of it, doesn't mean that she's not scared to take something away from the mouth of a big dog at 8 years old (or any age because where I'm from you are told not to mess with a dog if it's eating something because it could bite you).", "YTA sounds like your foster daughter froze like a deer in headlights as a response to the spontaneous problem, which isn\u2019t a helpful response but it is common. What you did, OP, was not a helpful response either; in fact it was a very harmful one. Now she has learned that when she makes a mistake to not come to you, because that will only result in being yelled at and punished. She made a mistake, and you reacted like she did it on purpose. It is completely understandable that you were upset by what she did but you did not have a fair reaction. In fact, she should have never been alone with her meds in the first place. It is very irresponsible to leave an 8 year old with a bottle of pills, even if it\u2019s theirs.

You don\u2019t think an apology is needed? There\u2019s probably a lot more work needed than an apology. You\u2019ve probably broken her trust and done more damage than you realize. \n\nShe\u2019s only eight years old, practically a baby. Given the fact that she\u2019s a foster child, who knows what kind of situation she had been in prior\u2014the emotions at hand here.

I don't know what's going on and if she's only staying temporary with you, but from the way you talk it's clear that you consider your dog as a member of your family (which is fine) while you clearly do not regard that HUMAN CHILD in the same way, which is horrible and makes me wonder why on earth you would take in a foster child to begin with?

I 46M have 3 kids and a foster daughter 8F. Our foster kid has adhd and takes meds for it everyday. Today  while i was making dinner she took her pills in the living room and apparently she dropped her pill while our dog was standing next to her and she didn\u2019t know what to do so she just stood there in shock while our dog ate her medicine like it was candy. When i saw the look on her face and our dog chewing on something i immediately knew what happened but it was too late cause he had already swallowed it. \n\nI was so mad at the fact that she didn\u2019t stop him from eating it and just stood there, we have a pretty big dog but he\u2019s not scary at all so i don\u2019t understand why she couldn\u2019t have stopped him. \nAnd after that i yelled at her like never before and told her that he could die now because of what she had done, and she started crying and i told her to her room. Me and my sons called around to different veterinarians and they said he would be fine and he also was surprisingly . When my wife  found out about how mad i got at her she accused me of being to harsh because shes just a kid. I don\u2019t personally think i owe her an apology when her stupidity could have hurt our dog. Aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
