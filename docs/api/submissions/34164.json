I was off to the side and dancing a little bit to pass the time. COWORKER had asked why I was dancing, and when I responded she proceeded to try to touch my butt with her foot. When I backed away she told me to come closer and turn around. I repeatedly told her no, but she kept on caressing my butt with her foot. I then walked out of the kitchen to try to calm myself down.  Both Dining Room Assistants later asked if I was okay, and said they\u2019d be willing to talk to whoever to confirm this story. \nSimilar inappropriate incidents have happened with residents with this same employee. I don\u2019t expect to be sexually assaulted in my place of employment. This is making my work environment very hostile and I don\u2019t feel comfortable in this current situation. I love working for COMPANY and I love my job, but I do not want to work with someone who feels entitled enough to touch another employee inappropriately. \nI hope this incident will be taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.\n\nThank You. \nOP", "NTA, your coworker crossed a line.\nThere's a decent chance this will escalate into a formal review/investigation at your work. Because of this I'd suggest removing this post for your own protection - if HR/the touchy lady find this they will comb it for the slightest inconsistencies in the story and potentially use that to challenge/undermine you. \n\nI believe you, but the fact that your summary above is not identical to the email you sent HR could be used to make the process more difficult for you.\nBest of luck.", "NTA. If the younger colleagues think you should report it, and the older ones don't, that's pretty good evidence that you were in the right", "NTA, that lady\u2019s creepy.

Stand your ground, it is DEFINITELY worth reporting her.", "NTA No one should be putting their foot on anyone else.  You're in a healthcare facility.  There are all kinds of things on the floor, and she just transferred them onto your clothes.  Even if they wanted to deny it was sexual harassment and you took it wrong, you clearly told her not to.  She crossed a boundary and contaminated your uniform with possible urine, feces, dirt, etc.  Every resident bathroom and employee bathroom is contaminated with this stuff.  The fact it was your backside makes it sexual.  I hope they listen to you.  If she harasses you or does anything with a resident at work, file a report for each offense.", "Proud of you for reporting! You did the absolute right thing!", "NTA\n\nThis definitely goes WAY beyond being even remotely acceptable if you two were friends and just having fun at work together. From the sounds of it, she's basically a stranger, who is more than old enough to be your mother. This feels predatory and as you mentioned, similar incidents to this has happened before to others. She shouldn't be around people who can't take care of themselves. You are in the right, and should stand your ground. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.", "Hahahaha wtf", "[deleted]", "HR is NOT your friend, they are there for the benefit of the company, reporting someone to HR puts YOU on the radar & endangers your position... reporting a co worker should be a LAST resort, you should at the least talk to the individual unless it was harassment or hate related.

If you feel like dancing and it's done in a way that's not hindering anyone preforming their job and it's done briefly and tastefully, you do you :) \n\nYour body is to never be touched by any coworker in any manner unless it is for medical emergencies or you personally invite the touch, ie wanting a reassuring hug when appropriate (say grieving for a nice resident who has passed away)\n\nThe people who are wanting you to dismiss it are not comfortable with dealing with the reality of trespass that coworker did to your personal safety. They want to not be involved. Which is their right, and they have a right to their personal opinion on the situation. But it's only your business to make the decisions you make to protect yourself first. And the mature thing to do is for others to respect that.  \n\nThat being said, however, do not be surprised if you get negative or non-supportive pushback from other coworkers or even HR for doing this reporting. But as long as you feel you did the right thing for yourself, trust yourself and keep doing your job the best you can. At any place of employment, you are allowed to access the state of the environment you work in and if someone is making it too unsafe or toxic for you to do your job, you have the right to speak up for yourself.", "If anything this is more polite than I was expecting, well done", "This is incredibly well written and uses all of the right words to make sure HR takes you seriously.

Me doing jazz hands as I talk to my cook about what I need to serve to my residents. Also, the way my job works, I only see patients a few hours of my day and there is a severe amount of downtime. No this is not me excusing the dancing, but there is no harm in me wiggling my fingers around.", "1. How is it Boomer bashing\n2. imo the post and the email aren\u2019t that much different ones just more professional than the other.", "I totally had my mom help me write it, think I should remind people that I\u2019m 19 so a lot of my high school real life learning experience was screwed up by covid\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Ah, then you might appreciate some extra context:\n\nMost US sexual harrassment laws were passed in the 1990s, depending on the state. While there was limited liability before then, it didn't amount to shit. When your 50+ coworkers were your age, their coworkers wouldn't have gotten in trouble for something like this (which means they absolutely should know better)\n\nThis doesn't excuse their behavior at all. They would have been upset by it then, and if they were mature adults, they wouldn't want to create a better world now. But what you're seeing from the other coworkers is probably a bit of a hazing mentality of \"we had to deal with this shit and we came out okay, so everyone else deserves to suffer like we suffered\"", "i get that i\u2019m part of the \u201cwoke\u201d generation so there\u2019s going to be some pushback for sure, she\u2019s just not the company i\u2019d prefer to be around if that\u2019s how she acts", "The \"woke\" generation is everyone under 40.
