If she had apologized and promised not to do it again I'd maybe have a different answer, but she didn't and tried to make you feel bad about being upset that SHE was doing something wrong to you. NTA a thousand times.", "NTA I do think there's things missing from the story here because it seems dramatic she lost all her friends.\n\nBut you don't pay the time if you don't do the crime.\n\nOr whatever people say.", "Nta, next time just put a lot of hot sauce on the food, or mix in a lot of laxatives. Make them suffer", "NTA I mean you just told your friends about what happened, I mean how could you have known that they would follow up with another confrontation with your roommate? She shouldn\u2019t have touched your food, and let me emphasize it, YOUR FOOD!

If she's really upset about you \"ruining her life\" maybe she should be upset at **HERSELF** for stealing your food.  I'm calling it stealing because that's what it was.  She didn't have your permission, after all.\n\nShe is 100% the AH here.  If she didn't want to lose her friends, maybe she shouldn't have been an AH and stolen your food in the first place.\n\nShe was also an AH when you confronted her with it.  If, say, she were on medication that gave her midnight munchies, and apologized **and bought you replacement food**, she'd not be an AH.  Instead, she got angry and doubled down.\n\nThe consequences of losing her friends are 100% her fault.  You just showed her friends a truth she wanted to hide.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time.", "NTA - cuz unless you're intention was to cost her friends, it was the consequences of the situation playing out. People vent about fraustrating problems that is life. (Venting doesn't equal bashing fyi)\n\nIdk I feel like it's a bit harsh to end a friendship over that though... My first thought is concern of your roommate not having food for themselves and why that is... Like does your roommate need food assistance?\n\nIf your roommate was just eating your cheese cake cuz it's cheese cake that is shitty, but if they were eating food because they need help that's another thing and probably needs to be fixed... Roommate might need help adulting if that is the case.", "ESH, this in no way should a roommate eating food they shouldn\u2019t be eating turn into losing her friends, there is something missing here and we need to know in order to gauge who the AH actually is.", "INFO: did you ask her why she was doing this?  Does she have money for food?", "Technically NTA, but you sound a little melodramatic. She stole your food, but she didn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d anything to it.

It's not a public place, you made your roommate feel really unsafe, I bet.\n\nAnd more, you should have talked to your roommate first, bc there might be reasons for such behavior.

Your roommate is an AH for stealing the food in the first place and getting defensive.\n\nYou're an AH for talking about this issue with other people, who have nothing to do with it. It's not your fault that these friends dumped your roommate and \"ruined her life\", but it is your fault that they found out.", "YTA\n\nYou're too old to be acting like an 8 year old.
