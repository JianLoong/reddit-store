Look, I understand you wanted to be generous with family, but you're 28.\n\nToo young to assume you wont need those savings for your own projects or a rainy day fund. \n\nToo old to be dragged into the drama of a teen. \n\nSis has yet to learn she isnt the center of everyone s universe and will take for granted any sacrifice you make so her life is easier. Let her parents deal with that. \n\nFor your own mental health, let anyone know the plan has changed and they need to find an alternative solution because you cannot give away those savings. \n\nThen stop trying to get youngest sis to tell you about her plans. If she does it on her own, great; if she does not, you'll wish her the best and be busy with your own life anyway.", "NTA At the very least, you should not be contributing to her finances until you find a new job. I would also talk to your father about her distance and contribute to your father's (parents) living situation. If they chose to use some of that money on her education, cool. I don't know how this would flow with your culture, but I wouldn't give her more than you can afford beyond your own saving goals.", "NTA\n\nCollege's fees are dependent from the country and the college. So understand you want to be updated. Did you give your sister any limit regarding budget & time you can support her financially?\n\nIt's valid that you have to support siblings when your parents spend all the money for you. But you shouldn't be forced to pay more than you got, e.g. when your sister wants to be at some expensive places.", "NTA, you don't even have to say why,  just that you lost your job and need to be careful", "NTA - I wouldn't give her anything. She treats you like a ATM and nothing more.\nIt also seems like that's she isn't close to you at all. Not from her side", "EDIT: I just noticed the bit about having lost your job. Honestly I think it probably WOULD be best for you to withdraw or at least reduce your offer to pay for her university fees because you aren't in a position to do so financially. I just can't picture spending your savings on that when you don't know how long the savings will last you to cover living expenses. So changing my judgment to NTA.\n\nHowever I think the rest of what I said is relevant for consideration...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It isn't out of any spite or revenge\n\nWell, if it weren't for the job loss it would be...\n\nThis is a somewhat odd dynamic for me to understand and I'm not sure why your parents/dad wouldn't sort of be the 'default' ones paying, but I chalk that up to cultural differences.\n\n(IF NOT FOR THE JOB LOSS,) I think you'd be punishing your sister for the simple fact that you aren't close. You admit that, it's due to differences between you, not a fault of either of you necessarily. You may have a standard or an expectation of being kept in the loop, because you're paying, and I can understand that somewhat, but it doesn't suddenly change the fact that she is not as close to you as she is to the other sister. She may not be intending to keep you OUT necessarily, but isn't comfortable sharing mundane details of a plan that is in progress. Withholding money over this would strike me as excessively punitive and controlling actually.\n\nAll I can suggest is that you sit down with her and explain you would like to use this opportunity to do something together, that you want to support her but are uncomfortable with the plans being made without any involvement from you. Emphasize this as something you're doing together.", "NTA it's a horrible financial decision to pay her college fees if you're unemployed", "NTA. She keeps biting the hand that would feed her. You owe her nothing. She is your sister, not your child. Inform your father that you have decided to withdraw your offer of support for her since it is his responsibility as her parent. Then, completely disengage from her, which is clearly what she would prefer.", "NTA. If I was in your position, I'd want to be kept in the loop to know what amount I would be expecting to pay. You certainly have a right to be able to know your own financial position, and u can't very well do that if you have no idea what a future expenditure might be. And I sure wouldn't want to help a person who deliberately hides parts of their life from me that they literally share with the rest of the world (IG posts)", "YTA.  If this were solely about being unable to contribute because you are unemployed or the fees ended up being more than you anticipated, I would be on your side for that.  But you are trying to use the money to coerce your sister into certain behavior that ultimately has nothing to with the money under the threat of pulling the money out for under her if she doesn\u2019t.  That\u2019s not going to create the closer relationship you seem to want, it will only alienate her and make her distrustful of you.", "OP, gently, YTA. Sounds as if you thought that because your parents asked you to finance her tuition you have a right to control and take decisions about her college status. This is very controlling behavior and I don't wonder why your sister stopped sharing information which wasn't finalized with you - because she didn't want your opinion on the matter (you know already how different your styles are). \n\nYou get to decide what you do with your own money, but don't lie to yourself that it is because of your sister's behavior. You are trying to use the money as a punishment - yet another controlling behavior.", "ESH, her for intentionally hiding info from you. You for trying to secure relationship with money.\n\nAll in all, stop being petty and tell your family you can't shoulder her fees coz YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB. At least that is somewhat true and will help you stop this mess of a family feud", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Old is making sound decisions is not controlling when it is the older sister\u2019s money she is spending. OP is not a blank check. Any parent who would be footing the bills would want the same level of informatio.   \nOP isn\u2019t tracking her movements or questioning each decision, she simply wants to be looped in to ensure her money isn\u2019t being wasted or potentially used on bad decisions. It isn\u2019t like an 18 yr old is always the role model for perfect decision making.", "It was a joint decision (me and my parents) to send her abroad and i offered to cover her expenses since i am the one with the most savings in the family.", "She does have a saying in the decision. If OP Sister choose an way to expensive college OP can't effort or not for to long the sister will be upset again because \"OP never told her limits and is now ruining her dream college.\" so better to keep each other update before hand", "I feel like this situation warrants an ESH. Yes, I agree that OP is quite controlling but the youngest sister seems to be a little rude to OP. She treats OP as an ATM and doesn't seem very grateful. If she had an issue with OP, she should have talked to her instead of being rude while expecting OP to part with her hard-earned money. While OP shouldn't push too much for info sis should be a little nicer in her response. OP is sacrificing quite a bit for her. The both of them should learn to communicate better.", "Not you for not paying could affect her choice / future it's her behavior that affects it.\nShe can't treat you like you have nothing to do with it but hold her hands open for money at the same time", "Realizing you have been clear with her asking to be 'kept in the loop', I find myself wondering if this is partially a communications or misplaced expectations issue. It should be enough that you've asked that, but...I guess I'm unclear on what you expect and why. Are you expecting to have options presented to you that you choose for her from a limited set? You mentioned you didn't offer any budgetary restrictions and didn't want her to be limited so, what would she be asking you for in terms of input, exactly?", "Obviously we don't have the details but there are some mentions in OP's post that show some level of conversation *with OP* was occurring, like this: \n\n>However, i would sometimes find myslef lost and missing details in the conversation which was due to the fact that she wasn't keeping me entirely updated\n\nOP 'found out' information about hostels had been mentioned to someone else (the other sister) but honestly WHY is that information so offensive? The youngest sister might have mentioned in passing that she's checking out hostels and suddenly she's completely screwed up the situation with OP? I don't think so. \n\n\"Entitled little shit\" is a reach. OP admits *they are not close*. OP gifting this money doesn't  suddenly change that fact.", "That 18-year-old is sharing the plans and asking for advice the other sister, with whom she is closer and more connected.

The younger sister is sharing more of the details with the middle-sister with whom she is in a better relationship and it sounds as if OP is almost jealous of the information the other sister is getting but they aren't.", "I expect her to share her findings about college and we can all be discussing together as to which is a better option, considering her choice and preference as well.\nI guess i am mainly hurt for being kept out of discussion and not being respected enough.\nThis leads to consider to not have my hard earned money be spent on her and instead on myself as originally planned.", "I guess it's also about sharing a private bond. I am happy to participate in the life of family and friends.

I understand that but if you could try to suspend the feeling of being offended, you might be able to resolve this. Even with your response, I can understand an aspect of confusion playing a role here - you just want her to sort of tell you regularly what she's finding so that you can... respond somehow and influence her choices. But you did previously say you didn't want her options to be limited, hadn't given a budget, etc. so perhaps in her understanding it IS her choice solely.", "So? The youngest sister SOUNDS LIKE she's still in the exploratory phase. Should she call up OP daily to say \"Today I looked at websites for x, y, and z - just FYI\". Of course not.", "that'd be my expectation, i'd expect her to have looked at a handful and picked out one or two, then had a conversation around what's financially viable - the variance in hostels is a hell of a lot larger then what she plans on having for dinner each night...", "Mm hm, and if she doesn't have the same expectation she's an 'entitled little shit'.
