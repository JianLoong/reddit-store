Look, I understand you wanted to be generous with family, but you're 28.\n\nToo young to assume you wont need those savings for your own projects or a rainy day fund. \n\nToo old to be dragged into the drama of a teen. \n\nSis has yet to learn she isnt the center of everyone s universe and will take for granted any sacrifice you make so her life is easier. Let her parents deal with that. \n\nFor your own mental health, let anyone know the plan has changed and they need to find an alternative solution because you cannot give away those savings. \n\nThen stop trying to get youngest sis to tell you about her plans. If she does it on her own, great; if she does not, you'll wish her the best and be busy with your own life anyway.", "NTA At the very least, you should not be contributing to her finances until you find a new job. I would also talk to your father about her distance and contribute to your father's (parents) living situation. If they chose to use some of that money on her education, cool. I don't know how this would flow with your culture, but I wouldn't give her more than you can afford beyond your own saving goals.", "NTA\n\nCollege's fees are dependent from the country and the college. So I understand you want to be updated. Did you give your sister any limit regarding budget & time you can support her financially?\n\nIt's valid that you have to support siblings when your parents spend all the money for you. But you shouldn't be forced to pay more than you got, e.g. when your sister wants to be at some expensive places.", "NTA, you don't even have to say why,  just that you lost your job and need to be careful", "NTA - I wouldn't give her anything. She treats you like a ATM and nothing more.\nIt also seems like that's she isn't close to you at all. Not from her side", "EDIT: I just noticed the bit about having lost your job. Honestly I think it probably WOULD be best for you to withdraw or at least reduce your offer to pay for her university fees because you aren't in a position to do so financially. I just can't picture spending your savings on that when you don't know how long the savings will last you to cover living expenses. So changing my judgment to NTA.\n\nHowever I think the rest of what I said is relevant for consideration...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It isn't out of any spite or revenge\n\nWell, if it weren't for the job loss it would be...\n\nThis is a somewhat odd dynamic for me to understand and I'm not sure why your parents/dad wouldn't sort of be the 'default' ones paying, but I chalk that up to cultural differences.\n\n(IF NOT FOR THE JOB LOSS,) I think you'd be punishing your sister for the simple fact that you aren't close. You admit that, it's due to differences between you, not a fault of either of you necessarily. You may have a standard or an expectation of being kept in the loop, because you're paying, and I can understand that somewhat, but it doesn't suddenly change the fact that she is not as close to you as she is to the other sister. She may not be intending to keep you OUT necessarily, but isn't comfortable sharing mundane details of a plan that is in progress. Withholding money over this would strike me as excessively punitive and controlling actually.\n\nAll I can suggest is that you sit down with her and explain you would like to use this opportunity to do something together, that you want to support her but are uncomfortable with the plans being made without any involvement from you. Emphasize this as something you're doing together.", "NTA it's a horrible financial decision to pay her college fees if you're unemployed", "NTA. She keeps biting the hand that would feed her. You owe her nothing. She is your sister, not your child. Inform your father that you have decided to withdraw your offer of support for her since it is his responsibility as her parent. Then, completely disengage from her, which is clearly what she would prefer.", "NTA. If I was in your position, I'd want to be kept in the loop to know what amount I would be expecting to pay. You certainly have a right to be able to know your own financial position, and u can't very well do that if you have no idea what a future expenditure might be. And I sure wouldn't want to help a person who deliberately hides parts of their life from me that they literally share with the rest of the world (IG posts)", "YTA.  If this were solely about being unable to contribute because you are unemployed or the fees ended up being more than you anticipated, I would be on your side for that.  But you are trying to use the money to coerce your sister into certain behavior that ultimately has nothing to with the money under the threat of pulling the money out for under her if she doesn\u2019t.  That\u2019s not going to create the closer relationship you seem to want, it will only alienate her and make her distrustful of you.", "OP, gently, YTA. Sounds as if you thought that because your parents asked you to finance her tuition you have a right to control and take decisions about her college status. This is very controlling behavior and I don't wonder why your sister stopped sharing information which wasn't finalized with you - because she didn't want your opinion on the matter (you know already how different your styles are). \n\nYou get to decide what you do with your own money, but don't lie to yourself that it is because of your sister's behavior. You are trying to use the money as a punishment - yet another controlling behavior.", "ESH, her for intentionally hiding info from you. You for trying to secure relationship with money.\n\nAll in all, stop being petty and tell your family you can't shoulder her fees coz YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB.

There is a term for this called \"forced solidarity\" You need to make your family think you have no savings available.\n\nTo the financially uneducated, money in the bank is \u201cjust sitting there doing nothing\u201d so it seems perfectly reasonable to demand it be shared. In some countries, people have to actively hide savings from their relatives. \u201cFrom field observations of credit cooperatives in Cameroon, we find that 19% of the loans taken are fully collateralized by savings held in the same institutions. This behavior is costly to the borrower, as it represents a net interest payment of about 24% per year\u2026interviews with members of the cooperatives suggest the following new rationale: *members resort to borrowing to signal to friends and relatives that they are poor and do not have savings available. By doing so, they can avoid requests for financial help. * Individuals, who took loans fully collateralized by their savings, claim that they use loan repayments as an excuse to oppose demands for money made by friends or family. One member summarizes it as follows: \u201cWhen I take a loan from my savings, my children and my wife think I have no money. I do it on purpose. If I simply withdraw my money, it will end, so I tell them that I borrowed. Then, when one complains he has a problem, I say I have to pay back my loan. It protects me from my children\u2019s demands.\u201d While taking a loan may seem an expensive mechanism to escape solidarity obligations, it needs to be examined in light of the African context. Social pressure for interpersonal redistribution in the form of cash transfers is high in Africa and several studies reveal a large family demand for hidden or protected saving https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227629940_Pretending_to_Be_Poor_Borrowing_to_Escape_Forced_Solidarity_in_Cameroon", "NTA.\n\nBut I found this pretty funny:\n\n> Now my youngest sister and I always shared bittersweet relationship, her being a gen-z and me a millennial.", "NTA ,for 2 reasons:  1.

Is it possible that she's using you so she can backpack/travel through wherever she's going?", "From reading some of your posts, it sounds like miscommunication and the age difference are playing havoc here.\n\nFirst off, you just lost your job, so that kind of puts the kibosh on paying the fees anyway, from my perspective.  \n\nSecond, you should have EXPLAINED to your sister that there is only so much money.  Teens, a lot of the time, haven't quite grasped the realities of budgeting for this kind of thing and tend to think that where they want to go is just simply affordable somehow.\n\nThird, I think by not giving the above explanation to your sister, she didn't think it necessary to keep you in the loop.  Therefore you felt slighted by, what in your view, was her typical teen behaviour of disrespect.\n\nESH because everyone had a part to play in this.  Although, it's kind of mild.", "YTA - I agree with everyone else. You shouldn\u2019t pay her fees. You aren\u2019t that established and should focus on your own finances right now and let your dad cover her education. \n\nBut your reasons are ridiculous.

I would tell sister that since she feels like she don't have to talk to you about her choices, then you feel like you don't have to contribute towards her college education.  Let her know that it works both ways.  Her telling you her choices allows you to be able to budget your finances/savings so that you can help her.  Now if she keeps you firmly in the loop as she do towards your other sister, then you are amiable towards financing her but it's her choice to do so and it's your choice to help or not help her due to her choice.", "NTA least she could do is keep you informed about what you\u2019d be paying for.

It hurts that you are helping her out and she does not want to share information with you. \n\nThat being said, while you can control where you put your money, you CANNOT control what she tells/shares with you or what her decisions are regarding schools or hostels or whatnot. She is growing up and becoming her own person as well, and she needs the freedom to make those without feeling smothered. Otherwise, this is just going to ruin whatever sisterly relationship you are trying to build. \n\nYou have the perfect reasoning right now --- you just lost your job. No one needs to know how much savings you have, or what you are doing with your money.

But I doubt that as the youngest sister expands her world view that she will be wanting to get a great job to continue to support the family back home, including OP.  At this point, being a bit selfish is necessary. OP's been hurt and felt like an outsider. They should keep money. Sounds like they'll need it.", "Depending on her culture- yes the younger person should be keeping the older one in the loop. There might be no 'independence' for younger siblings.\n\nIn any case, OP shouldn't feel obligated to pay for her sisters education now that she has lost her job. Other relatives can step up or younger sister can get a job.", "You\u2019re too old now to pay for anyone but yourself. You are unmarried and may not have kids. You are not getting you her.

It is the older sister contributing and risking her savings without much information. Not many people would be comfortable with this scenario.   \nOp isn\u2019t asking for much just basic information, which is particularly crucial once she lost her job.", "Yes one could look at it this way, that i am jealous of her sharing info with other sister, but she has always shared more with other sis than with me\nI have mentioned thats its okay and i understand, i dont ask to be told everything that they share. Only this once, since i am contributing with my savings, i felt like i deserved to know and be kept in the loop.", "I think that's a nice goal to have but suddenly having this arrangement doesn't magically make them close. Is it entirely fair of OP to assert a new closeness or expectation of closeness due to this financial agreement? I don't think it is. I don't fault her for wanting it, but OP should see the reality is that to her sister they still aren't close. Lil sis acting like they aren't close - becuase they aren't - isn't necessarily offensive.", "\"Op isn\u2019t asking for much just basic information, which is particularly crucial once she lost her job.\"\n\nPretty sure OP described wanted to be looped into everything, not just basic information.", "I agree it isn\u2019t necessarily offensive, but if a gesture as big as paying for college abroad isn\u2019t enough for little sister to make an effort, she doesn\u2019t deserve the money", "It is easier to say to say \" I don't feel respected\" rather than \" I don't feel important, loved\". Op is not little sister's ATM.", "She doesn\u2019t need to suspend any feelings, her sister is treating her like an ATM and the solution is very easy. OP shouldn\u2019t spend a thin dime on sending her sister anywhere, especially given her own financial situation", "I guess that comes down to what is basic information. As stated above, it is not like she is looking for every detail. However, if the sister has started to narrow down her decisions so that she may be finalizing the hostel to stay in, then yes that is basic information which needs to be shared.", "I get that perspective, but I maintain that if the emotions in the situation could be extinguished a bit it might help. Saying \"I am going to withdraw this money because I don't feel respected\" is pretty loaded. I don't feel we have enough going on to say the sister is treating her like an ATM - she is treating her like a sister that *she isn't close with*. The 'Please keep me in the loop' is reasonable on the surface but what does that mean exactly? I think it's likely the sister believes she IS keeping OP in the loop, and simply isn't giving frequent updates on decisions she is exploring but isn't ready to actually make yet. Meanwhile it's not meeting OP's expectations so she wants to punish the little sister.", "Don't get me wrong, OP can do whatever she wants with her money and is in her right to withdraw the financial support. But trying to play the card that she is doing that because she feels disrespected that her sister is \"hiding her IG stories\" from her is a bit ... manipulative. The sister has a right to her privacy too - this isn't anything connected with the university. For that matter - hostel I assume is the temporary stay until she gets the college accommodation settled - so why is this such an important piece of information. I thought that the elder sister is helping pay the college tuition fees, not everything?"]}
