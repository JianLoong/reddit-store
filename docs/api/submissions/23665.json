He and my Mom are separated and she lives in a different city. I still have a good relationship with her and see her every holidays. She has a new Boyfriend that I also get along with really well.\n\nMy Dad hasn't had a relationship since he and my Mom split up. We live together with 2 of his close friends, Nikita and Galina, who are like family.\n\nYesterday, I came home and thought nobody was there. I couldn't find my phone charger so I went to my Dad's room to get his. I had headphones on and didn't think anyone was home so I just went inside.\n\nLong story short, I wasn't home alone. My Dad and Nikita were both in bed and naked. They both looked shocked and I  didn't know how to react so I just ran to my room and locked the door.\n\nMy Dad knocked on my door a few minutes later and asked to talk to me but I told him to go away. He asked me to let him explain. I told him I didn't want to hear it and that I'm disgusted that he would do something like this and won't accept it. I grew up with them as my family. Nikita is basically an uncle to me.\n\nMy Dad left me alone after that. I didn't see him before he went to work today but he'll probably try to talk to me again when he gets back. \n\nWas I wrong for how I reacted?\n\n\nEdit: Why do make up your own versions? I never said I have a problem with them both being men. It's not about that. Can't you read?\n\nEdit 2: I want to thank the people who commented and gave genuine advice on what I wrote. I'll decide if I want to talk to my Dad tomorrow. I have questions I want to ask him but I don't know if I really want to know the answers. Thank you for your help and support\n\n\nTo those who couldn't be bothered to stick to what I wrote and had to create their own narrative: why do you even bother commenting if you're too lazy to read?

He handled this whole thing poorly.  \n\nAs an outsider reading about this situation, I can see that the relationship makes perfect sense.

It\u2019s normal to feel this way especially due to your age, of course you are going to feel emotions about it. However, your dad cannot always be single. He deserves a chance to find love again.

I think you know that you spoke out of shock, which is why you're here asking if you're the asshole.\n\nJust hear them out, OP. It sounds like you have a good relationship with all of the parties involved, so there will be an adjustment period, but at least you know they're all good people, right?\n\nYou should probably explain your thinking when you made that comment. And also spend this time coming to terms with that even if you do not accept it yet, it is happening. You're not going to break them up, but you will succeed in making yourself miserable.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good dad, OP. He has primary custody and that doesn't typically happen if he was a bad dad. Just let him know you're shocked and you just don't know how to parse it all out because what's going on does not match what you thought was happening.", "NAH, they are both consenting adults, its none of your business who your father sleeps with. That being said, at your age i understand you are upset and confused. Just give it time", "INFO: Does it make your uncomfortable that your dad is with a man? Or is it that your dad kept his relationship with an uncle figure a secret and kind of betrayed your trust that makes you feel bad?", "YTA\n\nI hate to say it but you are.  Not for being shocked...that happens.  For your response.  If your father found love, regardless of who it is, it doesn't matter who it is.  Your parents are separated and your mom is already in a relationship, how exactly is this any different?  Because Nikita is a male?\n\nYou need to have a real conversation with your dad as he may have been gay this whole time and just went through the motions with your mom to not stand out.

And I think it's okay for you to need to take time to adjust your view of that relationship.\n\nIf I'm right about this, then I'd suggest you write these feelings down and show your dad if you're ready for a face to face conversation. You were surprised yes, and he did not prepare you for the news in any way either. I'm sorry you had to see that, no-one wants to see that, but i think it's important to know what you're finding \"disgusting\".", "YTA.\n\nI think the big lesson here is KNOCK before you go into someone else's room.

You don't.  You are acting like a spoiled brat toddler.  \n\nIt was a an unfortunate situation, and I get you are both a bit embarrassed and uncomfortable, but it time to grow up and bit and show your dad some grace.", "NTA.

But I wouldn\u2019t continue to call it disgusting as that is very harsh. The reason you didn\u2019t know about it was probably his fear to tell you. Just make sure that when you guys do talk that he knows you didn\u2019t say it was disgusting because it was another man. I mean, I sure hope it\u2019s not because of that.", "YTA. \n\nAre they both consenting adults?  Is there some kind of insane age difference?  If not, they are adults.

You are still quite young and have a lot still to go through with understanding relationships, including that of your own in the future. \n\nParents sleep with eachother...it's normal...how do you think you and perhaps younger siblings came along? They don't wait for you to leave the house on all occasions. \n\nSound like it was more of a shock knowing it is with someone you have known your whole life. This could be the reason behind your parents separation, but he didn't know how to navigate telling you.  They may have been together for a long time and were planning to tell you when the time is right. \n\nPlease hear him out. At the end of the day he is still your father and nothing will change that.

You're entitled to your feelings, but calling him disgusting is a bit much. However, I understand your pain. This is probably the reason your mom and him are separated, and while there's nothing wrong with being gay, it's understandable that you feel betrayed. \n\nAnyway, talk to your dad, listen to whatever he has to say, and don't forget he's still the same person even if you're now discovering things you didn't know about him.", "Soft YTA. Anyone would be shocked walking in on a naked parent with a naked partner. It's ok to be shocked and surprised. But you need to talk to your dad and let him tell you what's happening. He might be gay, he might be bi, or it might have been some weird naturist thing with no sex involved at all. Your dad's sexuality might be the reason his marriage broke up. He might be incredibly unhappy at having to keep his sexuality hidden from you. Just talk to him, and listen to him.", "Soft YTA\n\nAlthough this may have shocked you, you shouldn't be upset at your father. Do you disapprove of him being with another man (OP called Nikita \"like and uncle\", so I'm assuming this is a man). I think it's important to be respectful of your father's sexuality while you sort your own feelings out.", "NTA. Gay man here. \n\nYou are entirely entitled to your initial reaction to this situation. You\u2019re a 15 year old child, you walked in and saw your dad and his close friend, who you consider to be an uncle. Your dad, who you always thought was a straight man. It\u2019s shocking. It hurts for a myriad of reason. Hell, my dad died 10 years ago and I still can feel a way about my mom\u2019s boyfriends. \n\nHave a conversation with your dad when you\u2019re ready. Tonight might be too soon, and thats fair. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re entitled to a freak out over this. But your dad is still your dad - he loves you, he takes care of you, he wants what\u2019s best for you. He\u2019s a human being and he has some kind of relationship with this man.\n\nYou guys will get through this. Take some time, feel what you need to feel, express yourself, and work through it. You now know your dad is either gay or bisexual, and that isn\u2019t going to go away, Nikita or not. Take some time and hopefully you will learn to accept him for who he is. You love him, you can\u2019t let this destroy your relationship. And it won\u2019t if you guys give each other space to feel what you need to feel. \n\nTo everyone saying that OP is homophobic, perhaps that\u2019s true. But if you\u2019re seriously telling me that at 15, seeing your separated father in bed with another man wouldn\u2019t shock you, I think you\u2019re lying to yourself. Let\u2019s not write off a young person discovering something shocking.", "It's because the relationship isn't normal.\n\nMy Mom dated her boyfriend and eventually moved in with him. My Dad and Nikita have known eachother for 20 years and live together with another friend and me. They should've told me about it when it started so I could've chosen to stay with my Mom instead", "Is galina Nikita\u2019s wife? Or do you think they are all just roommates?  I can\u2019t tell either way but one of these situations make it not okay.", "No, they aren't dating", "INFO: Well it says that Nikita is like \"an uncle to him\". So it sounds like Nikita is a male and that the OP just had no realization that his father was gay or bisexual.

It just feels wrong", "We all live together. It makes me uncomfortable to think they might be doing those things while I'm home", "He\u2019s a child", "Find your dad in bed with another man and keep that same energy maybe as an adult I might process it differently but he's just a kid. How do you expect him to react.?", "Neither of them is gay though. We all live together. It makes me uncomfortable to think they might be doing those things together when I'm home. I don't even know how long it's been going on. They both lied to me all this time", "It seems fairly normal. They have probably been close for a long time. You really can't control who you're attracted to.\n\nIt also says a lot that he didn't raise you to be accepting of other lifestyles. This is probably a burden he has carried alone his entire life. And your reaction probably breaks his heart.", "There is no strict timeline for love and relationship to blossom. Some people date and never move in together. Some are just roommates first then later turn to dating. Some people get married within months of getting together. There are no rules got relationships. What I am saying is, if you are trying to make sense of the the chronology of the relationship, it will not yield any result.\n\nYou can be upset that they didn't tell you. But at the same time, your father is a single man and he has every right to date and meet someone. The only thing is Nikita was already in his life and they chose to pursue it forward. You need to try to understand that your dad and Nikita are probably together because they have known each other for so long and seen many ups and downs together.\n\nMoving away to your mom's will not help your cause.

If this is the reason behind the reaction.", "your dad found love with a trusted person who loves you. what is wrong with that?", "Ok, but there's no actual issue with it, you just don't like that you knew the person he's sleeping with so well.\n\nIn which case, this was a severe over reaction, while you may have been shocked there's no reason to call him disgusting or that you could never accept it.

You don't get veto power over their personal lives.", "What about your mom and her bf doing those things while you're there?", "That\u2019s no excuse.", "I think both of them are either gay or bisexual.", "Imma be honest. \nYour dad should have told you sooner about the relationship with Nikita. However it sounds like he\u2019s been trying to keep his personal life separate from you. \n\nThe thing is is that although Nikita might be seen as an uncle to you has no bearing on what your dad sees in Nikita. From the sounds of it they have had a much longer adult relationship (platonic and otherwise) that you were not a part of, and don\u2019t know.\n\nIt may be good to talk to your dad about his relationship and what he has to say, but you can not control if he stays in the relationship. That\u2019s not your choice to decide. You could state your opinion but I\u2019d keep a really open mind about their relationship instead of this knee-jerk reaction of uncomfortablility to an adult relationship.\n\nThe way that you are talking about your dad and Nikita\u2019s relationship makes me think you may be homophobic or biphobic or have some of it internalized. They are two adults in a consenting relationship, they\u2019re not harming anyone. \nAs other commenters said, all parents do it when kids are home, even your mom and her bf- which lends it self to you potentially having some internalized homophobia because you couldn\u2019t possibly imagine your dad or Nikita as gay or bi. That\u2019s something that you need to figure out for yourself", "Sorry kiddo but if they aren\u2019t gay they are at the least bi- or pan- sexual. Neither of them owe you information about their sex lives. Even if you weren\u2019t all living together it\u2019s possible they would be \u201cdoing those things\u201d with you in the house. \n\nYTA for calling a consenting adult relationship disgusting.", "No parent has to share every aspect of their personal life with their children.

Again, don't let your shock/feeling of betrayal turn into homophobia.", "How did they lie? Did they claim *not* to have a sexual relationship? Or did they just not talk to you about their sexual relationship?", "Agreed. I think more info is needed for sure. Having said that.. I'd be somewhat upset as a 15 year old to know that the parent I was living with was having a full blown secret relationship with the aunt like figure we were living with. But yeah like you said if the reaction is to the previous said situation.. that would not be okay.", "He should've told me so I could've made the choice to live with my Mom", "I wouldn't have a problem with that. That's the normal thing to do. If he meets someone and starts dating he'll eventually introduce us and maybe she moves in with us after some time", "I'm aware that they're probably doing things while I'm staying with them but they have a normal relationship. They're dating  and I haven't known him all my life", "I think somewhat upset, is reasonable, telling them they are disgusting and that you'd never accept it, is not so reasonable. Either way, this seems like an over reaction to the situation.", "But your mom will still be banging her boyfriend at the house if you lived with her so why is it any different that your dad is doing the same thing?", "If him being gay makes you want to not live with him I see why he didn't tell you about it. Being homophobic is gross. They're both adults if they wanna have sex it's fine. Grow up and get over yourself.", "Your feelings are understandable but your dad is allowed to do what he's doing.", "Yeah. There was a complete lack of acceptance in this situation. And maybe that's why the dad didn't say anything in the first place.\n\nSorry OP. But YTA.", "This. Soooooooo much fucking this.", "Where did I say it's because they're both men?", "Okay, I\u2019ve ready your comments, I gotta go with soft YTA. You\u2019re equating Nikita to being an uncle & I think you\u2019re calling their relationship \u201cunnatural\u201d *because* you see him as family, when in reality you serve no blood relation to Nikita and their relationship is perfectly normal. I can see how it would be a shock to a 15 year old, but to say two consenting adults who share no blood relation to each other are being unnatural is a stretch. Apologize to your dad and talk to him to see where he is coming from & why he never told you, but don\u2019t go making rash decisions or being upset because you\u2019re shocked and confused.", "Yes. You are immature and selfish. Who your father has intimate relationship with is none of your business. Let him be happy.", "Bro, Nikita has always been your dad's boyfriend. Nothing has changed, other than you found out about it.", "Did you find your phone charger?", "Gently YTA\n\nI know this was shocking, but adult relationships are complicated and messy. Not like the fairytale romances Disney sells you. Yes, your father could have so many reasons for not telling you and Ik that hurts, but he sounds like he made a call to not tell you.\n\nIk it probably is shocking, but parents do not always have to tell their kids about their relationships. This could be a new thing and he may not know if it will last. It could be more complicated and he is trying to understand his own identity. This is where you need to be your most mature and understand where he is coming from. \n\nYour father still seems like he loves you and keep in mind your mom has also moved on. I think you need to talk to him and really find out what is going on, but also don\u2019t name call, don\u2019t be judgemental. He didn\u2019t plan for you to find out this way and trust me this is one of those things you will understand so much more when you are older.", "INFO: I've been reading your replies.\n\nSo, your problem with your dad and Nikita's relationship is that they seemed to be friends with benefits? If they were dating, like actual boyfriends, would you be ok with that?", "YTA. i was willing to give you a pass at first cause you\u2019re a kid and this must all be a lot to process, but it\u2019s obvious from your comments that the only\nreason you have for being disgusted with the relationship is cause they\u2019re both men", "YTA Your comments have made it clear this is about homophobia. You said outright you wouldn't mind your father having a girlfriend because that would be \"normal\". And to everyone saying he's just a teenager, that does not excuse being a bigot!\n\n Edit: fixed a typo that led to accidental misgendering", "You keep using the word \"not normal\" when referring to the relationship between your dad and Nikita. I would have brushed it off as not homophobic if weren't for the fact you have now said it more then handful a times, as well as citing it as wrong and disgusting.\n\nNAH for now, but if you continue stand on this ground of vague \"wrongness\" you will be the AH.", "YTA. This is why some people feel they can\u2019t be out to their family - they don\u2019t want to see disgust from loved ones. \n\nYou have a chance to redeem yourself.

Leaving everything else aside you\u2019re being incredibly selfish to punish him by refusing to talk. \n\nYes, 15 year olds have big feelings. Sometimes those feelings lead you to being an asshole. This is one of those times.", "Very gentle YTA. Your dad didn\u2019t tell you about this because he knew it would upset you and he never meant for you to walk in on them like them.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be angry, but once you calmed down, talk to him. Please. This is your dad. He loves you. Just talk to him.", "INFO: Why exactly do you find this to be \u201cdisgusting\u201d? Is it a \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see my dad having sex\u201d thing or a \u201cmy dad is gay\u201d thing?", "When I was young I walked in on my father with another woman who I was familiar with. It was very painful and confusing. She was our masseuse and I was furious. I only say this because I don't want you to fear that this response exclusively stems from your father's attraction to men.\n\nEncountering your parents being overtly sexual in any capacity can be jarring.\n\nI'm sure with time the stress response will subside. Science says exercise can speed it up, but I'm sure that's the furthest thing from your mind. Don't rush yourself. Hold space and compassion for yourself.", "You need to talk with your dad and tell him that you\u2019re hurt he kept this a secret from you.

Hopefully he didn\u2019t cheat on your mom with his friend. \n\nPlease know that this is a normal relationship.  Often people are friends first and develop romantic relationships later. Maybe it just started and your dad needed to be sure it was a strong relationship before telling you?\n\nPlease talk with your dad.  Tell him you hated finding out that way. Ask him for the story.

Did it contribute to the parents separating? Is that why they chose to live with that family friend? \n\nI know that if this had occurred when I was growing up and I caught EITHER of my parents sleeping with ANY of our long time family friends I wouldn\u2019t have handled it elegantly. Teenagers don\u2019t tend to have the experience and autonomy to shrug it off and move on. They literally have to live with these decisions because as their tax status claims, they are dependents. OP is dependent on his parents and now he\u2019s forced to live with the fact his parent is sleeping with someone he viewed as family.", "Ok\\_Smile9222 has the best advice.\n\nAll I can add is... let your dad know that you will want to talk to him about this and *when you are ready*, you will let him know.\n\nNTA", "Hey.

It's understandable that you were in shock but I can't even imagine how gutted your dad must feel after you said that. The entire reason Nikita may feel like family to you is probably because they've been in this relationship a while and he saw you as family. Now you turn around and stab them in the heart like this not to mention your dad wasn't ready to come out to you yet but was so suddenly outed beyond his control. \n\n He may be your dad but he's a human being with feelings too.

Your youth is what stops me from calling you the AH here.\n\nBut there is not an infinite amount of grace here. Your reaction was juvenile, but the follow up doesn't have to be. When your father returns, have the conversation with him on what happened, what you can expect moving forward, and do your best to be understanding. Trust me, he didn't want you to learn the way you did either, and it's likely going to be just as challenging for him to talk to you about it as it will be for him.\n\nYour father has enough room in his heart for you and Nikita, so make enough room in your heart for him and his needs.", "NTA.

Would you think it was sweet that they found companionship with someone they love and trust? Or would you also think it is appropriate? Some people can only be attracted to people they know well. \n\nBut also, kids tend to hold their parents to unrealistic standards. Your dad has a right to privacy, as do you, and it would actually be inappropriate for him to share details about his sex life with you. You keep using the term \u201cnormal\u201d in your comments, but I think you mean traditional. Your dad may be bi/pan/poly/demi or any other non-traditional identity. This could be why your parents split. You reaction seems to be triggered by the fact that your concept of your dad is now changed.

But I do think that you need to think about your dad and Nikita. Are they happy? Are they fooling around? It could be that they are in a committed relationship with each other.

Does the fact that your dad is seeing him makes a difference in that sentiment?", "What exactly is the issue?

Because the way you talk about it sounds like your homophobic unless you give the right context.\n\nI think what you are trying to say is that you considered Nikita as family and that you were under the impression that your dad thought the same thing. Basically Nikita was like a brother to him and why would you sleep with a family member. Which is why you're ik with your mom because her partner was a stranger. You need to talk to your dad and apologize for your comment, at the very least so he can give you the history of what's going on. You're pretty much at the age where you learn that your parents are people with their own stuff, like to you they are mom and dad, but to others they are regular people that some wanna befriend or sleep with.

So...why are you upset? Because you consider Nikita family? I mean--I'm sure there are lots of couples in your family, and you'd consider both halves of the couple family. Why is it wrong for two people you consider family to be intimate if they aren't related to each other? Is it because they're hooking up in the house you live in? I assume your parents were too when they were together, that's also normal. It would be a problem if your dad was loudly and openly hooking up (whether with Nikita or a stranger) and exposing you to it, but it sounds like they were being discreet and you accidentally walked in. Otherwise you never would have even known. And as for who your dad has a relationship with or hooks up with--honestly that's his business, not yours. YTA and you should apologize, and also explain that it wasn't that Nikita is a man that upset you because your dad is probably assuming that too.", "NTA, similar situation here & trust me, it\u2019s fkn weird seeing someone you used to consider as family become your step parent ur feeling are 100% valid dw", "You probably felt blindsided because you\u2019ve been living there the whole time without knowing.

I would say give them a shot to explain.\nEdit- oh and YOU are NTA, sweetie. Also, I am so sorry this happened to you, and I am inclined to think your Dad is too. Still big hug, it\u2019s beyond awkward and I can imagine why you would be upset- mostly feeling betrayed, amirite? On many levels? Understandable.

Catching one's parent naked, mid-coitus, can be a jarring experience, one that you cannot unsee. Catching your separated parent mid-coitus, with someone of the same sex (when you had no idea he was even gay) is even worse. Now you may have some idea as to why your parents have separated. The fact that Nikita has been living under your roof and you saw him as an uncle figure just adds insult to injury.

I would expect you to be equally as shocked if you found your dad in the same situation with an \u201caunt\u201d.  \n\nI would take some time and think about why you\u2019re really upset. Consider what your dads viewpoint may be.  Also realize that your dad has emotions, wants and needs just like anyone else. When it comes to adult relationships it can get kind of complicated.

She\u2019s transgender but before we knew about it we had added (at the time) him on a mobile game. The avatar was a female character with a feminine name.

He needs to take a step back and examine the actual \"whys\" behind his feelings so it can be resolved in healthy way (just talking his part of it here, I'm not saying that he's solely responsible for fixing the entire situation or anything). Hopefully he'll get some kind of help with that kind of self-examination, since at his age he probably hasn't developed the tools for it yet.", "Oh, absolutely. I do empathize with the fact that this is a pretty big shock! I probably didn\u2019t make that clear enough in my original response, which is my bad.

But it\u2019s how we react and act on those feelings in ways that effect other people\u2026 well, you know. \n\nThe way OP keeps calling the relationship \u201cdisgusting,\u201d for one. I understand that no one wants to walk in on their parents naked (or worse), but saying that they wouldn\u2019t even want to live with their dad if they\u2019d known this was on the table? How they\u2019d be much happier if their dad had a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship? The way they acknowledge how their mother is probably intimately involved with her boyfriend, but it\u2019s somehow wrong solely if it\u2019s their father? OP clarifies in several comments that they aren\u2019t being homophobic, but also doesn\u2019t seem receptive to the knowledge that an uncle-like figure to *them* is probably just a close friend to their dad. I understand, too, that this is OP\u2019s immaturity and lack of perspective at play! But that same immaturity and reactivity of theirs is what lands them in the wrong to me. \n\nIt also rubs me the wrong way that OP wanted to be told everything right off the bat about their dad\u2019s relationship, but we also don\u2019t know how new/old it is \u2014 or what even are the particulars of the relationship! What if this is a week old relationship? I totally understand OP\u2019s dad not saying anything. What if this really is a FWB situation? It\u2019s a complete accident that OP walked in on them, and totally unfortunate, but it\u2019s also different matter than it being two grown men dating. \n\nThere\u2019s just a lot that we don\u2019t know, because OP didn\u2019t want to hear it.

You seem to be under the delusion that you are directly involved in their relationship.  You're not. You're an outsider looking in. \n\nThink of it like this, if they went on a romantic date, would they invite you along?? No, then it's pretty clear you are not part of the relationship and don't get to dictate the terms of it. \n\nBe happy your dad found companionship. Explain to him that you were just shocked and that it took a minute for you to realize that they both are still the same people you have always known them to be, and make sure he understands that as you see him as an uncle that you don't want their relationship to effect your relationship with them individually", "Why is their relationship disusting Then?", "[deleted]", "Ahh, yes, that Russian guy..", "It's not a \"yay\" moment at all, but \"your relationship is disgusting and I'll never accept it\" is an asshole choice of words. And the question as posed by the Op was \"am I the asshole for saying...\" not \"am I the asshole for being shocked\" or \"am the asshole for feeling lied to\".  \n\nBut I guess it depends why Op feels the relationship is disgusting? Like, if he's worried something was going on while Mom and Dad were together...I understand that more?

It would be every bit  confusing as it would be disgusting to see your father sleeping with someone you deemed an uncle. Let\u2019s not throw homophobia labels at people unless they clearly display signs of homophobia. OP simply is not. \n\nOverall, no one is an asshole.

So I\u2019m assuming they were lying by omission and having to sneak around because they didn\u2019t want OP finding out. My impression is that OP wouldn\u2019t have cared as much if they approached him and were honest. He would have had time to process it. But being blindsided and walking in on them having sex is about the worst way he could have found it. Honestly he needs time to process his emotions.

I reacted more negatively towards my parents about situations a lot less traumatizing than what OP saw. I think most commentators are being disingenuous trying to hold him to adult standards. \n\nI also had close family friends that I called uncle and aunt. I was closer to them then my actual blood relatives. It would be disgusting to me if I walked in on my parents or siblings having sex with them. It\u2019s about the length and closeness of their relationship. It\u2019s in the realm of step siblings hooking up to me. \n\nOP clarified his moms normal relationship was about how it progressed not the genders. OP was kept in the loop and was able to process his emotions. He felt part or included in their relationship which is important when you parents are divorced. \n\nI don\u2019t think it should come as a shock that OP wanted to be kept in the loop with what is happening with 2 parental figures that he lives with.

OP shouldn\u2019t have just barged in without knocking.", "Exactly! I'm 42, and as far as I'm concerned, my parents had sex exactly thrice, and I'm only willing to concede that much because they have 3 children, lol.", "\"Maybe use some critical thinking instead of jumping to extreme conclusions after hearing one thing...\"\n\nSorry, this is Reddit, we don't do that here.", "I think it's assholeish to see it as incestuous. Adults have good friends, and roommates, and those are the people they get into relationships with. Adults don't become automatically related to each other in those situations just because a kid is in the mix and in that social bond.\n\nBut, if the friendship preexisted the separation and that seems \"suspicious\" to Op, or the separation was messy or there was cheating, I can understand the reaction more.\n\nAlso, of course I don't want to see my Dad butt naked with anyone. It should be equally gross flinging the door open to him and anyone getting it on. Would Op have used those words about never accepting the disgusting relationship in any scenario where he accidentally saw something none of us want to see?", "How about disgusted that his dad is FUCKING HIS UNCLE?\n\nFuck the homophobia angle. I'd be freaked out if my dad was fucking someone I considered my aunt.", "I mean, I\u2019m fairly certain his dad didn\u2019t intend for him to find out this way. Without more info, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s fair", "Like I said, I don't have a problem with them being 2 men. The confused people are the ones who can't seem to read properly without inventing and adding things of their own.\n\nTo make it as simple as possible so everyone of you can understand: if he has a normal relationship with another man or woman I'll be happy for him", "Because he spent his whole life thinking of the other man as a family member.", "When I was 7 I walked into my parents room because I wanted to tell them I was home from school, my naive self still just barged in. Not too scarring because I had no idea what they'd actually been doing till later in life.. my dad died 3 years ago. I'd be weirded out if she were with certain of their friend group for sure.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve come to that conclusion after being in here a while now", "I'm with you, NTA for the reaction, but definitely YTA for the explanation and not elaborating", "Agreed. Very messy and OP has a justified freak out. They\u2019re only 15 after all. But OP needs to bring it back in and get some answers until they do this whole situation will remain messy and unsolved.", "I agree. But I think op immediately going to \u201cthey\u2019ve been lying to me for years\u201d is a bit harsh. Also my point was more that we don\u2019t know if they where together when OP and their dad moved in.", "Yessss. Everyone is so quick to jump to homophobia. Like imagine if you caught your father sleeping with someone you considered an uncle, at 15 years old. Combine that with not knowing his father is into men and that makes for quite a shock", "Pansexual here, and yeah that's my thinking as well. \n\nThis fifteen year old kid just got a hell of a shock in finding out that not only does his father who he previously believed to be straight, like men, but that the man he is currently having a relationship with is someone that they consider the be like family. \n\nThat is a LOT for any human being to have to process. Let alone a hormonal teenager who is dealing with his parents divorce, and is still living with said parent.", "I see where the disconnect happened in my comment.\n\nI think the dad should have been more careful, lock the door etc.", "Wouldn\u2019t the fact that you\u2019ve known Nikita all your life be a positive? I\u2019m not sure I understand why two people you love dearly, being together and loving each other bothers you so much.", "What is abnormal about their relationship?", "Thank you for taking the time to reply to this. Would you now reply to the far more important post I sent to you about the actual issue then?", "There are options", "Totally fair (although I think careless would be the better word)", "Nothing, but I think OP is hung up on his perception of Nikita as his surrogate Uncle, which gives this relationship incestuous vibes (from his perception) even if it isn't actually incest.", "I agree it is OPs responsibility to self reflect and process his emotions. But that is my issue with so many commentators. They are attacking OP and calling him homophobic for his shocked response. He is a teenager and will need time/help to really come to terms with how he feels. That\u2019s basically the point I\u2019ve been trying to get across. This was a traumatic event for him. Everybody reacts and processes traumatic situations in their own way and own pace. But I think it\u2019s unfair and lacks empathy to call him homophobic from his story. \n\nI have to push back a little on it not being his dad responsibility about being walked in on. Dad could have locked the door, he could have done it at a time he knew his son wouldn\u2019t be coming home, or a place his son wouldn\u2019t have gone. I have siblings and lived in a small house growing up. None of us ever walked in on my parents having sex. We also never caught each other. It was all of our responsibility to be discreet because we lived under the same roof.", "While his reaction can be explained by his age and the situation at hand it doesn't mean OP wasn't an asshole with his reaction, calling his dad's relationship disgusting was too far. Teenagers are notoriously not rational and therefore act like assholes because of it, that's why we give them some grace, but correct their behaviour so they don't continue to act like that going forward", "But it is a very common way to start a relationship. Many people are friends before they become lovers. \n\nIt might be a shock, but there is nothing anormal with their relashionship. Unless your parents separated because of it. That would be an entire other story. \n\nYou are 15 years old, you still know very little about life. You will need to do a little work on yourself. You say you are not homophobic, but you clearly have a problem with it. In your mind, your dad can only be friend with him, he can\u2019t be in love with him.  But that\u2019s not how love works.", "Totally see that (that could be his perspective, even if I disagree with it) I was legitimately trying to give a runway for an answer that explains where he\u2019s coming from regarding his discomfort outside of the homophobia suggestions. Sorry if it came across as a gotcha attempt", "You're totally right. How dare I want my Dad to tell me the truth about his relationship to the people we live with", "Where?", "You kniw me so well, huh? I guess if you, a complete stranger, says so it must be true.\n\nI have the same relationship to Galina as I have to Nikita. If it had been her and my Dad I would've reacted the same.\n\nBut of course you know better", "You said you would have moved out if he *had* told you. If you don\u2019t want to be perceived as homophobic you need to explain why it would have been an issue had you been told before you found out like this. When you call this relationship unnatural, you have to ask yourself, is getting into a relationship with someone that *youve* known for years unnatural? Because that\u2019s how many, many, relationships begin\n\n(Or, more appropriately,\nget off the internet and talk to a therapist about this whole thing)", "You still don't know the truth because you didn't let him explain. Reacting emotionally at first makes sense, but don't blame him for not talking about it when he's trying to. Let him explain first and try to listen with an open mind, it sounds like your dad cares about you.", "They\u2019re right. You\u2019re 15 and your dads an adult entitled to his own privacy.
