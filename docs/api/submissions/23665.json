It\u2019s normal to feel this way especially due to your age, of course you are going to feel emotions about it. However, your dad cannot always be single. He deserves a chance to find love again.

I think you know that you spoke out of shock, which is why you're here asking if you're the asshole.\n\nJust hear them out, OP. It sounds like you have a good relationship with all of the parties involved, so there will be an adjustment period, but at least you know they're all good people, right?\n\nYou should probably explain your thinking when you made that comment. And also spend this time coming to terms with that even if you do not accept it yet, it is happening. You're not going to break them up, but you will succeed in making yourself miserable.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good dad, OP.

Not for being shocked...that happens.  For your response.  If your father found love, regardless of who it is, it doesn't matter who it is.  Your parents are separated and your mom is already in a relationship, how exactly is this any different?

And I think it's okay for you to need to take time to adjust your view of that relationship.\n\nIf I'm right about this, then I'd suggest you write these feelings down and show your dad if you're ready for a face to face conversation. You were surprised yes, and he did not prepare you for the news in any way either. I'm sorry you had to see that, no-one wants to see that, but i think it's important to know what you're finding \"disgusting\".", "YTA.\n\nI think the big lesson here is KNOCK before you go into someone else's room.

You don't.  You are acting like a spoiled brat toddler.  \n\nIt was a an unfortunate situation, and I get you are both a bit embarrassed and uncomfortable, but it time to grow up and bit and show your dad some grace.", "NTA.

But I wouldn\u2019t continue to call it disgusting as that is very harsh. The reason you didn\u2019t know about it was probably his fear to tell you. Just make sure that when you guys do talk that he knows you didn\u2019t say it was disgusting because it was another man. I mean, I sure hope it\u2019s not because of that.", "YTA. \n\nAre they both consenting adults?  Is there some kind of insane age difference?  If not, they are adults.

You are still quite young and have a lot still to go through with understanding relationships, including that of your own in the future. \n\nParents sleep with eachother...it's normal...how do you think you and perhaps younger siblings came along? They don't wait for you to leave the house on all occasions. \n\nSound like it was more of a shock knowing it is with someone you have known your whole life. This could be the reason behind your parents separation, but he didn't know how to navigate telling you.  They may have been together for a long time and were planning to tell you when the time is right. \n\nPlease hear him out. At the end of the day he is still your father and nothing will change that.

You're entitled to your feelings, but calling him disgusting is a bit much. However, I understand your pain.

Anyone would be shocked walking in on a naked parent with a naked partner. It's ok to be shocked and surprised. But you need to talk to your dad and let him tell you what's happening. He might be gay, he might be bi, or it might have been some weird naturist thing with no sex involved at all. Your dad's sexuality might be the reason his marriage broke up. He might be incredibly unhappy at having to keep his sexuality hidden from you. Just talk to him, and listen to him.", "Soft YTA\n\nAlthough this may have shocked you, you shouldn't be upset at your father. Do you disapprove of him being with another man (OP called Nikita \"like and uncle\", so I'm assuming this is a man).

Gay man here. \n\nYou are entirely entitled to your initial reaction to this situation. You\u2019re a 15 year old child, you walked in and saw your dad and his close friend, who you consider to be an uncle. Your dad, who you always thought was a straight man. It\u2019s shocking. It hurts for a myriad of reason. Hell, my dad died 10 years ago and I still can feel a way about my mom\u2019s boyfriends. \n\nHave a conversation with your dad when you\u2019re ready. Tonight might be too soon, and thats fair. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re entitled to a freak out over this.

He\u2019s a human being and he has some kind of relationship with this man.\n\nYou guys will get through this. Take some time, feel what you need to feel, express yourself, and work through it. You now know your dad is either gay or bisexual, and that isn\u2019t going to go away, Nikita or not. Take some time and hopefully you will learn to accept him for who he is. You love him, you can\u2019t let this destroy your relationship. And it won\u2019t if you guys give each other space to feel what you need to feel. \n\nTo everyone saying that OP is homophobic, perhaps that\u2019s true. But if you\u2019re seriously telling me that at 15, seeing your separated father in bed with another man wouldn\u2019t shock you, I think you\u2019re lying to yourself. Let\u2019s not write off a young person discovering something shocking.", "It's because the relationship isn't normal.\n\nMy Mom dated her boyfriend and eventually moved in with him.

I don't even know how long it's been going on. They both lied to me all this time", "It seems fairly normal. They have probably been close for a long time. You really can't control who you're attracted to.\n\nIt also says a lot that he didn't raise you to be accepting of other lifestyles. This is probably a burden he has carried alone his entire life. And your reaction probably breaks his heart.", "There is no strict timeline for love and relationship to blossom. Some people date and never move in together.

What I am saying is, if you are trying to make sense of the the chronology of the relationship, it will not yield any result.\n\nYou can be upset that they didn't tell you. But at the same time, your father is a single man and he has every right to date and meet someone. The only thing is Nikita was already in his life and they chose to pursue it forward. You need to try to understand that your dad and Nikita are probably together because they have known each other for so long and seen many ups and downs together.\n\nMoving away to your mom's will not help your cause.

However it sounds like he\u2019s been trying to keep his personal life separate from you. \n\nThe thing is is that although Nikita might be seen as an uncle to you has no bearing on what your dad sees in Nikita. From the sounds of it they have had a much longer adult relationship (platonic and otherwise) that you were not a part of, and don\u2019t know.\n\nIt may be good to talk to your dad about his relationship and what he has to say, but you can not control if he stays in the relationship. That\u2019s not your choice to decide. You could state your opinion but I\u2019d keep a really open mind about their relationship instead of this knee-jerk reaction of uncomfortablility to an adult relationship.\n\nThe way that you are talking about your dad and Nikita\u2019s relationship makes me think you may be homophobic or biphobic or have some of it internalized. They are two adults in a consenting relationship, they\u2019re not harming anyone. \nAs other commenters said, all parents do it when kids are home, even your mom and her bf- which lends it self to you potentially having some internalized homophobia because you couldn\u2019t possibly imagine your dad or Nikita as gay or bi. That\u2019s something that you need to figure out for yourself", "Sorry kiddo but if they aren\u2019t gay they are at the least bi- or pan- sexual. Neither of them owe you information about their sex lives. Even if you weren\u2019t all living together it\u2019s possible they would be \u201cdoing those things\u201d with you in the house. \n\nYTA for calling a consenting adult relationship disgusting.", "No parent has to share every aspect of their personal life with their children.

I'd be somewhat upset as a 15 year old to know that the parent I was living with was having a full blown secret relationship with the aunt like figure we were living with. But yeah like you said if the reaction is to the previous said situation.. that would not be okay.", "He should've told me so I could've made the choice to live with my Mom", "I wouldn't have a problem with that. That's the normal thing to do. If he meets someone and starts dating he'll eventually introduce us and maybe she moves in with us after some time", "I'm aware that they're probably doing things while I'm staying with them but they have a normal relationship. They're dating  and I haven't known him all my life", "I think somewhat upset, is reasonable, telling them they are disgusting and that you'd never accept it, is not so reasonable. Either way, this seems like an over reaction to the situation.", "But your mom will still be banging her boyfriend at the house if you lived with her so why is it any different that your dad is doing the same thing?", "If him being gay makes you want to not live with him I see why he didn't tell you about it. Being homophobic is gross. They're both adults if they wanna have sex it's fine. Grow up and get over yourself.", "Your feelings are understandable but your dad is allowed to do what he's doing.", "Yeah. There was a complete lack of acceptance in this situation.

Soooooooo much fucking this.", "Where did I say it's because they're both men?", "Okay, I\u2019ve ready your comments, I gotta go with soft YTA.

I can see how it would be a shock to a 15 year old, but to say two consenting adults who share no blood relation to each other are being unnatural is a stretch. Apologize to your dad and talk to him to see where he is coming from & why he never told you, but don\u2019t go making rash decisions or being upset because you\u2019re shocked and confused.", "Yes. You are immature and selfish. Who your father has intimate relationship with is none of your business. Let him be happy.", "Bro, Nikita has always been your dad's boyfriend. Nothing has changed, other than you found out about it.", "Did you find your phone charger?", "Gently YTA\n\nI know this was shocking, but adult relationships are complicated and messy. Not like the fairytale romances Disney sells you. Yes, your father could have so many reasons for not telling you and Ik that hurts, but he sounds like he made a call to not tell you.\n\nIk it probably is shocking, but parents do not always have to tell their kids about their relationships. This could be a new thing and he may not know if it will last. It could be more complicated and he is trying to understand his own identity. This is where you need to be your most mature and understand where he is coming from. \n\nYour father still seems like he loves you and keep in mind your mom has also moved on. I think you need to talk to him and really find out what is going on, but also don\u2019t name call, don\u2019t be judgemental. He didn\u2019t plan for you to find out this way and trust me this is one of those things you will understand so much more when you are older.", "INFO: I've been reading your replies.\n\nSo, your problem with your dad and Nikita's relationship is that they seemed to be friends with benefits? If they were dating, like actual boyfriends, would you be ok with that?", "YTA. i was willing to give you a pass at first cause you\u2019re a kid and this must all be a lot to process, but it\u2019s obvious from your comments that the only\nreason you have for being disgusted with the relationship is cause they\u2019re both men", "YTA Your comments have made it clear this is about homophobia.

Leaving everything else aside you\u2019re being incredibly selfish to punish him by refusing to talk. \n\nYes, 15 year olds have big feelings. Sometimes those feelings lead you to being an asshole. This is one of those times.", "Very gentle YTA. Your dad didn\u2019t tell you about this because he knew it would upset you and he never meant for you to walk in on them like them.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be angry, but once you calmed down, talk to him.

It was very painful and confusing. She was our masseuse and I was furious. I only say this because I don't want you to fear that this response exclusively stems from your father's attraction to men.\n\nEncountering your parents being overtly sexual in any capacity can be jarring.\n\nI'm sure with time the stress response will subside.

Your youth is what stops me from calling you the AH here.\n\nBut there is not an infinite amount of grace here. Your reaction was juvenile, but the follow up doesn't have to be. When your father returns, have the conversation with him on what happened, what you can expect moving forward, and do your best to be understanding. Trust me, he didn't want you to learn the way you did either, and it's likely going to be just as challenging for him to talk to you about it as it will be for him.\n\nYour father has enough room in his heart for you and Nikita, so make enough room in your heart for him and his needs.", "NTA.

This could be why your parents split. You reaction seems to be triggered by the fact that your concept of your dad is now changed.

Basically Nikita was like a brother to him and why would you sleep with a family member. Which is why you're ik with your mom because her partner was a stranger. You need to talk to your dad and apologize for your comment, at the very least so he can give you the history of what's going on. You're pretty much at the age where you learn that your parents are people with their own stuff, like to you they are mom and dad, but to others they are regular people that some wanna befriend or sleep with.

Why is it wrong for two people you consider family to be intimate if they aren't related to each other? Is it because they're hooking up in the house you live in? I assume your parents were too when they were together, that's also normal. It would be a problem if your dad was loudly and openly hooking up (whether with Nikita or a stranger) and exposing you to it, but it sounds like they were being discreet and you accidentally walked in. Otherwise you never would have even known. And as for who your dad has a relationship with or hooks up with--honestly that's his business, not yours.

Catching your separated parent mid-coitus, with someone of the same sex (when you had no idea he was even gay) is even worse. Now you may have some idea as to why your parents have separated.

We do not have everything figured out as much as we would like to try and say we do.\n\nWe are still just people.\n\nGive yourself some breathing room but when you approach your father remember that he is just a person just like you are just a person and we all go through stages in life and we learn different things.\n\nHe is still the man that raised you...

Consider what your dads viewpoint may be.  Also realize that your dad has emotions, wants and needs just like anyone else. When it comes to adult relationships it can get kind of complicated.

I understand that no one wants to walk in on their parents naked (or worse), but saying that they wouldn\u2019t even want to live with their dad if they\u2019d known this was on the table? How they\u2019d be much happier if their dad had a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship? The way they acknowledge how their mother is probably intimately involved with her boyfriend, but it\u2019s somehow wrong solely if it\u2019s their father? OP clarifies in several comments that they aren\u2019t being homophobic, but also doesn\u2019t seem receptive to the knowledge that an uncle-like figure to *them* is probably just a close friend to their dad. I understand, too, that this is OP\u2019s immaturity and lack of perspective at play! But that same immaturity and reactivity of theirs is what lands them in the wrong to me. \n\nIt also rubs me the wrong way that OP wanted to be told everything right off the bat about their dad\u2019s relationship, but we also don\u2019t know how new/old it is \u2014 or what even are the particulars of the relationship! What if this is a week old relationship? I totally understand OP\u2019s dad not saying anything. What if this really is a FWB situation? It\u2019s a complete accident that OP walked in on them, and totally unfortunate, but it\u2019s also different matter than it being two grown men dating. \n\nThere\u2019s just a lot that we don\u2019t know, because OP didn\u2019t want to hear it. And I get it, because that was a heat of the moment thing. But I can\u2019t support OP\u2019s reaction in the slightest.", "I\u2019ve read your post and all of your comments here. It\u2019s clear that you have homophobic views. That\u2019s the root of your problem. The fact that you can\u2019t see that is worrisome. Get therapy.", "Cuz your dad is a grown, single man who is allowed to find love.

Grow up dude.", "It's not your relationship. Their relationship doesn't involve you in any way, shape, or form. You seem to be under the delusion that you are directly involved in their relationship.  You're not. You're an outsider looking in. \n\nThink of it like this, if they went on a romantic date, would they invite you along?? No, then it's pretty clear you are not part of the relationship and don't get to dictate the terms of it. \n\nBe happy your dad found companionship. Explain to him that you were just shocked and that it took a minute for you to realize that they both are still the same people you have always known them to be, and make sure he understands that as you see him as an uncle that you don't want their relationship to effect your relationship with them individually", "Why is their relationship disusting Then?", "[deleted]", "Ahh, yes, that Russian guy..", "It's not a \"yay\" moment at all, but \"your relationship is disgusting and I'll never accept it\" is an asshole choice of words. And the question as posed by the Op was \"am I the asshole for saying...\" not \"am I the asshole for being shocked\" or \"am the asshole for feeling lied to\".  \n\nBut I guess it depends why Op feels the relationship is disgusting? Like, if he's worried something was going on while Mom and Dad were together...I understand that more? As opposed to \"it's disgusting because you've known him for a long time and he's your roommate\". I mean, yeah dude, that's how relationships start.", "[deleted]", "It being new doesn\u2019t help.  What it doesn\u2019t work out and that impacts the living arrangement and OP\u2019s relationship to N without understanding why?\n\nIt being someone OP deeply knows and is living with makes it WAY more complicated than a new stranger", "Also if it\u2019s an old relationship may have caused the divorce?  Messy", "Not homophobic, so much as shocked to find his uncle and dad together in bed.

I would have shown similar displays of emotion. \n\nJust because they\u2019re disgusted, does *not* mean homophobia is the reason. Let\u2019s put into account that OP grew up looking at Nikita as *an uncle* and her dad and mother separated. It would be every bit  confusing as it would be disgusting to see your father sleeping with someone you deemed an uncle. Let\u2019s not throw homophobia labels at people unless they clearly display signs of homophobia. OP simply is not. \n\nOverall, no one is an asshole. OP is extremely valid, however this isn\u2019t something Reddit can help them with. It\u2019s something that needs to be discussed between them and their father.", "The person I replied to was talking about a potential girlfriend and it's not about him bringing home a random man", "That's what he thought about Nikita", "From OP\u2019s perspective it\u2019s tantamount to incest. Nikita is like an uncle to him and he assumed Nikita was like a brother to his father.

When did it start?", "He\u2019s 15\u2026..They all live together under the same roof. So I\u2019m assuming they were lying by omission and having to sneak around because they didn\u2019t want OP finding out. My impression is that OP wouldn\u2019t have cared as much if they approached him and were honest. He would have had time to process it. But being blindsided and walking in on them having sex is about the worst way he could have found it. Honestly he needs time to process his emotions. Seems unfair that so many commentators are attacking him and calling him homophobic. \n\nIt\u2019s OPs dad and uncle figure. It\u2019s a parent\u2019s or adults responsibility to nurture/protect his child not the other way around. I also know if I was a teenager I probably wouldn\u2019t have had the tools/experience to have a healthy reaction if I was in the same situation as OP. When I was 15, I had a lot worse attitude towards events that were no where near this complicated.", "That\u2019s my point he is 15. I reacted more negatively towards my parents about situations a lot less traumatizing than what OP saw. I think most commentators are being disingenuous trying to hold him to adult standards. \n\nI also had close family friends that I called uncle and aunt. I was closer to them then my actual blood relatives. It would be disgusting to me if I walked in on my parents or siblings having sex with them. It\u2019s about the length and closeness of their relationship. It\u2019s in the realm of step siblings hooking up to me. \n\nOP clarified his moms normal relationship was about how it progressed not the genders. OP was kept in the loop and was able to process his emotions. He felt part or included in their relationship which is important when you parents are divorced. \n\nI don\u2019t think it should come as a shock that OP wanted to be kept in the loop with what is happening with 2 parental figures that he lives with.

That's everything they though was normal isn't. And their parent has sex.\n\nFact is, OP is a confused kid. Not a homophobe. \n\nThank you for being the voice of reason.", "That's my thought exactly, that after seeing him as an uncle, a member of the family, for so long that seeing them in bed has the VIBE of incest, like the porn trope about stepsiblings, and thus felt disgusting to this young teenager.", "I really don't get why it's disgusting just because this man has been a long term friend of Op's father, and has known Op since childhood.  Close friends often get into relationships and get married.  That's not incestuous.

Like worrying that his Mom would be hurt by this?", "\u2026\u2026 so you would have issue with him bringing a boyfriend home?", "In fairness, his dad isn't responsible for him walking in on him. Like that was not some active choice on the dad's part. It was the result of a normal oops moment that would usually have resulted in nothing, but in this case was a disaster. \n\nAnd yeah, it's not his responsibility to nurture and protect his dad. Which is why I never said that it is. But internal work is important, it's for his sake. Understanding the why of how you feel is an important part in being able to deal with it constructively, and a parent can't self-examine for you.

It seems like there\u2019s a lot of questions you should ask your dad to understand what it means if anything.

The fact you use the qualifier \"normal\" is proving that.\n\nI also get teenagers hate having adults tell them they are wrong makes their brains instantly tune out, but just stay put for a second.\n\nYou are allowed your feelings. You are allowed to feel shocked. What you do not get to do is use your feelings to define reality. Your feelings are not facts. How they came about is normal. There is not one way people start relationships. In fact it's not uncommon for longterm friends to try having a relationship.\n\nThe upside is you are reacting in your age. You are immature and still learning to handle situations. Talk to your dad. Don't tune him out. Talk to both of them. **Listen** to them instead of already having a response readied to tell them how wrong they are. Parents are human, just like you. You've had the realization we all have when they stop being on a pedestal. \n\nIt's time to grow as a person. Life throws lessons at us.

There is *nothing* wrong about that. Again, it's understandable that this is shocking to you at first, but you are seeing things only from your perspective.
