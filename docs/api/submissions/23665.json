He and my Mom are separated and she lives in a different city. I still have a good relationship with her and see her every holidays. She has a new Boyfriend that I also get along with really well.\n\nMy Dad hasn't had a relationship since he and my Mom split up. We live together with 2 of his close friends, Nikita and Galina, who are like family.\n\nYesterday, I came home and thought nobody was there. I couldn't find my phone charger so I went to my Dad's room to get his. I had headphones on and didn't think anyone was home so I just went inside.\n\nLong story short, I wasn't home alone. My Dad and Nikita were both in bed and naked. They both looked shocked and I  didn't know how to react so I just ran to my room and locked the door.\n\nMy Dad knocked on my door a few minutes later and asked to talk to me but I told him to go away. He asked me to let him explain. I told him I didn't want to hear it and that I'm disgusted that he would do something like this and won't accept it. I grew up with them as my family. Nikita is basically an uncle to me.\n\nMy Dad left me alone after that. I didn't see him before he went to work today but he'll probably try to talk to me again when he gets back. \n\nWas I wrong for how I reacted?", "created_utc": 1690921582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fnqu5/aita_i_told_my_dad_i_wont_accept_his_relationship/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure it would be a shock finding your dad naked in bed with anyone, especially someone you see as a relative.  But you reacted pretty harshly.  You may want to clarify why you find the relationship \"disgusting,\" that it's not homophobia, but more like an incest-y vibe to you. \n\nYour Dad should've told you about him & Nikita, and that's his fault.  He handled this whole thing poorly.  \n\nAs an outsider reading about this situation, I can see that the relationship makes perfect sense.  They're good friends, they've been living together...looks like a relationship from here.", "Your not an asshole. I couldn't Imagine finding my dad in bed with another man that was probably really traumatic and you probably should talk to a professional.", "I don\u2019t think asshole is the right word. It\u2019s normal to feel this way especially due to your age, of course you are going to feel emotions about it. However, your dad cannot always be single. He deserves a chance to find love again. You accept your mom moving on so I think it\u2019s only fair you give this a chance too", "YTA wait til he busts in your room when your doing the deed", "NAH.\n\nYou're really young and your dad should have figured out how to tell you that they were involved before you found out in such a shocking way. I think you know that you spoke out of shock, which is why you're here asking if you're the asshole.\n\nJust hear them out, OP. It sounds like you have a good relationship with all of the parties involved, so there will be an adjustment period, but at least you know they're all good people, right?\n\nYou should probably explain your thinking when you made that comment. And also spend this time coming to terms with that even if you do not accept it yet, it is happening. You're not going to break them up, but you will succeed in making yourself miserable.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good dad, OP. He has primary custody and that doesn't typically happen if he was a bad dad. Just let him know you're shocked and you just don't know how to parse it all out because what's going on does not match what you thought was happening.", "NAH, they are both consenting adults, its none of your business who your father sleeps with. That being said, at your age i understand you are upset and confused. Just give it time", "INFO: Does it make your uncomfortable that your dad is with a man? Or is it that your dad kept his relationship with an uncle figure a secret and kind of betrayed your trust that makes you feel bad?", "YTA\n\nI hate to say it but you are.  Not for being shocked...that happens.  For your response.  If your father found love, regardless of who it is, it doesn't matter who it is.  Your parents are separated and your mom is already in a relationship, how exactly is this any different?  Because Nikita is a male?\n\nYou need to have a real conversation with your dad as he may have been gay this whole time and just went through the motions with your mom to not stand out.  That doesn't mean he loves you any less.", "INFO are nikita and galina in a relationship?", "Your reaction is your reaction. But you\u2019re 15 years old and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely appropriate for you to know the ins and outs of your dads relationships. He didn\u2019t intend for you to find out, and you had no idea previously. \n\nYou need to hear him out. He is probably just as upset as you, if not more. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole.", "Of course YTA. \n\nLook, you get *some* leeway for accidentally seeing your father in a compromising position; no teenager wants to see that. No adult wants to see their parent like that! So, yes \u2014 some grace can be extended for how shocking and embarrassing it must have been to walk in on that. \n\nBut good lord, grow up. \n\nI saw your replies and your problem is apparently that *you* consider this person an uncle-figure to you? That your dad knew him for some number of years?? Uh, newsflash: *that\u2019s how people decide whether they want to date.* Which, you know, your dad and Nikita probably are! Maybe they\u2019re just FWB, but it literally doesn\u2019t matter because *their* relationship doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Besides any of that, Nikita probably knew your dad while you were just a malcontented little twinkle in SOMEONE\u2019S eyes. And if they didn\u2019t, who cares? Their relationship still doesn\u2019t involve you. \n\nCalling it disgusting was uncalled for, and I\u2019m sure you know it or else you wouldn\u2019t be seeking validation for your reaction. Your relationship with both people is an entirely different experience than what they themselves may have with one another. Is your dad\u2019s entire life supposed to be on pause for you? Is he just never supposed to date? Is he only allowed to date women that you exclusively approve of? Is this you being homophobic? Is this because you can\u2019t stand the thought that your dad and HIS friend could be romantically or sexually entangled? \n\nYou\u2019re a kid, so normally I would moderate myself! I\u2019m not going to this time. \n\nYou\u2019re being a dick, and your dad probably thinks you\u2019re a homophobe too. You may have totally crashed and burned your relationship. I hope for HIS sake that you aren\u2019t, and that you offer him \u2014 *and Nikita* \u2014 a sincere apology. \n\nDo better. *Be* better.", "Oh OP,  I feel for you.\n\nI think what it is is that Nikita feels like a blood relative to you and that is how you've always viewed his relationship to your dad, as a brother, perhaps?\n\nSo seeing them in anon-platonic manner threw your whole life out of turn because it feels inappropriate, not because of their gender or sexual orientation, but because it felt wrong for two \"brothers\" to be intimate. \n\nI think it's far less the idea of your dad being with a man, it is WHO that man is. And I think it's okay for you to need to take time to adjust your view of that relationship.\n\nIf I'm right about this, then I'd suggest you write these feelings down and show your dad if you're ready for a face to face conversation. You were surprised yes, and he did not prepare you for the news in any way either. I'm sorry you had to see that, no-one wants to see that, but i think it's important to know what you're finding \"disgusting\".", "YTA.\n\nI think the big lesson here is KNOCK before you go into someone else's room.  (I assume the door was closed.)\n\nAnd your dad should have been more careful and locked the door.\n\nSo you are both at fault.\n\nBut you are the AH for thinking you, a 15 year old, gets to dictate to your father how he lives his life and who he has intimate relationships with.   You don't.  You are acting like a spoiled brat toddler.  \n\nIt was a an unfortunate situation, and I get you are both a bit embarrassed and uncomfortable, but it time to grow up and bit and show your dad some grace.", "NTA. You were hurt, shocked and probably feeling a lot of other things. Your dad went about this in a very, very weird way and I\u2019m sorry you got caught up in it", "INFO: What is actually the problem with the relationship, just that you're close to Nikita?", "I would say yes but you\u2019re 15 haha. But I wouldn\u2019t continue to call it disgusting as that is very harsh. The reason you didn\u2019t know about it was probably his fear to tell you. Just make sure that when you guys do talk that he knows you didn\u2019t say it was disgusting because it was another man. I mean, I sure hope it\u2019s not because of that.", "YTA. \n\nAre they both consenting adults?  Is there some kind of insane age difference?  If not, they are adults.  Sometimes relationships change once one person suddenly becomes single.  \n\nMaybe they should've locked the door, but otherwise they did nothing wrong.", "How is this relationship any of your business?", "This is a tough one. You are still quite young and have a lot still to go through with understanding relationships, including that of your own in the future. \n\nParents sleep with eachother...it's normal...how do you think you and perhaps younger siblings came along? They don't wait for you to leave the house on all occasions. \n\nSound like it was more of a shock knowing it is with someone you have known your whole life. This could be the reason behind your parents separation, but he didn't know how to navigate telling you.  They may have been together for a long time and were planning to tell you when the time is right. \n\nPlease hear him out. At the end of the day he is still your father and nothing will change that. If your issue is only with that he's with someone you've known for ages and not because he is with a man then NTA", "NTA. you are still a child and it can be weird to see people who were friends become something else especially when you walk right in the middle of it", "YTA Obviously, how could you not be?", "Soft YTA\u2026 seeing your dad having any type of relations is going to be a shock to the system. But he\u2019s allowed to love who he loves, you don\u2019t get a vote.", "YTA and a bigot. Educate yourself.

You're entitled to your feelings, but calling him disgusting is a bit much. However, I understand your pain. This is probably the reason your mom and him are separated, and while there's nothing wrong with being gay, it's understandable that you feel betrayed. \n\nAnyway, talk to your dad, listen to whatever he has to say, and don't forget he's still the same person even if you're now discovering things you didn't know about him.", "Soft YTA. Anyone would be shocked walking in on a naked parent with a naked partner. It's ok to be shocked and surprised. But you need to talk to your dad and let him tell you what's happening. He might be gay, he might be bi, or it might have been some weird naturist thing with no sex involved at all. Your dad's sexuality might be the reason his marriage broke up. He might be incredibly unhappy at having to keep his sexuality hidden from you. Just talk to him, and listen to him.", "Soft YTA\n\nAlthough this may have shocked you, you shouldn't be upset at your father. Do you disapprove of him being with another man (OP called Nikita \"like and uncle\", so I'm assuming this is a man).

Gay man here. \n\nYou are entirely entitled to your initial reaction to this situation. You\u2019re a 15 year old child, you walked in and saw your dad and his close friend, who you consider to be an uncle. Your dad, who you always thought was a straight man. It\u2019s shocking. It hurts for a myriad of reason. Hell, my dad died 10 years ago and I still can feel a way about my mom\u2019s boyfriends. \n\nHave a conversation with your dad when you\u2019re ready. Tonight might be too soon, and thats fair. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re entitled to a freak out over this.

He\u2019s a human being and he has some kind of relationship with this man.\n\nYou guys will get through this. Take some time, feel what you need to feel, express yourself, and work through it. You now know your dad is either gay or bisexual, and that isn\u2019t going to go away, Nikita or not. Take some time and hopefully you will learn to accept him for who he is. You love him, you can\u2019t let this destroy your relationship. And it won\u2019t if you guys give each other space to feel what you need to feel. \n\nTo everyone saying that OP is homophobic, perhaps that\u2019s true. But if you\u2019re seriously telling me that at 15, seeing your separated father in bed with another man wouldn\u2019t shock you, I think you\u2019re lying to yourself.

I don't even know how long it's been going on. They both lied to me all this time", "It seems fairly normal. They have probably been close for a long time.

And your reaction probably breaks his heart.", "There is no strict timeline for love and relationship to blossom. Some people date and never move in together. Some are just roommates first then later turn to dating. Some people get married within months of getting together. There are no rules got relationships. What I am saying is, if you are trying to make sense of the the chronology of the relationship, it will not yield any result.\n\nYou can be upset that they didn't tell you. But at the same time, your father is a single man and he has every right to date and meet someone. The only thing is Nikita was already in his life and they chose to pursue it forward. You need to try to understand that your dad and Nikita are probably together because they have known each other for so long and seen many ups and downs together.\n\nMoving away to your mom's will not help your cause.

However it sounds like he\u2019s been trying to keep his personal life separate from you. \n\nThe thing is is that although Nikita might be seen as an uncle to you has no bearing on what your dad sees in Nikita. From the sounds of it they have had a much longer adult relationship (platonic and otherwise) that you were not a part of, and don\u2019t know.\n\nIt may be good to talk to your dad about his relationship and what he has to say, but you can not control if he stays in the relationship. That\u2019s not your choice to decide. You could state your opinion but I\u2019d keep a really open mind about their relationship instead of this knee-jerk reaction of uncomfortablility to an adult relationship.\n\nThe way that you are talking about your dad and Nikita\u2019s relationship makes me think you may be homophobic or biphobic or have some of it internalized. They are two adults in a consenting relationship, they\u2019re not harming anyone. \nAs other commenters said, all parents do it when kids are home, even your mom and her bf- which lends it self to you potentially having some internalized homophobia because you couldn\u2019t possibly imagine your dad or Nikita as gay or bi. That\u2019s something that you need to figure out for yourself", "Sorry kiddo but if they aren\u2019t gay they are at the least bi- or pan- sexual. Neither of them owe you information about their sex lives.

Again, don't let your shock/feeling of betrayal turn into homophobia.", "How did they lie? Did they claim *not* to have a sexual relationship?

I'd be somewhat upset as a 15 year old to know that the parent I was living with was having a full blown secret relationship with the aunt like figure we were living with. But yeah like you said if the reaction is to the previous said situation.. that would not be okay.", "He should've told me so I could've made the choice to live with my Mom", "I wouldn't have a problem with that. That's the normal thing to do. If he meets someone and starts dating he'll eventually introduce us and maybe she moves in with us after some time", "I'm aware that they're probably doing things while I'm staying with them but they have a normal relationship. They're dating  and I haven't known him all my life", "I think somewhat upset, is reasonable, telling them they are disgusting and that you'd never accept it, is not so reasonable. Either way, this seems like an over reaction to the situation.", "But your mom will still be banging her boyfriend at the house if you lived with her so why is it any different that your dad is doing the same thing?", "If him being gay makes you want to not live with him I see why he didn't tell you about it. Being homophobic is gross. They're both adults if they wanna have sex it's fine. Grow up and get over yourself.", "Your feelings are understandable but your dad is allowed to do what he's doing.", "Yeah. There was a complete lack of acceptance in this situation.
