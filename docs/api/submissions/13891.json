Was the comment uncalled for? Yes absolutely. It was a dumb comment to make, but he is 13 years old. He is going to make dumb comments. That\u2019s when the parents step in and say listen, those comments aren\u2019t okay and teach him. I think it\u2019s great he is doing everyone\u2019s chores. It\u2019s important for him to see how hard housework can be. He is learning those comment from somewhere, school, social media, etc. I said dumb stuff too because I picked up from somewhere and I thought it was funny or cool. But as I got older, I started to learn and grow. \n\nYour family is wild and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not apart of that family. I\u2019d be terrified to say or do anything knowing any thing little can set them off and they disowned me. Your family is more TA than your child. They are taking one little dumb comment too far. Your son isn\u2019t a full grown adult where he\u2019d know better, he\u2019s still a child who is still learning and testing boundaries. \n\nI\u2019m a women and honestly I\u2019d be like \u201cyeah, you might think it\u2019s women\u2019s work, but it\u2019s actually family work. The most important work you will ever do is within the walls of your home. So remember that when loading the dishwasher it\u2019s not a women thing but a family thing. It helps make it so everyone can spend time together at the end of the night. Both men and women can do work around the house. It doesn\u2019t make you less of a man to load dishwasher or fold some laundry\u201d", "I understand you are trying to teach him a lesson and I don't necessarily think YTA for how you went about it, but every one else is an AH for shunning him so hard. It's supposed to be a lesson learned. He's 13.", "YTA and your family moreso", "YTA no question, the punishment should be proportional to the crime. You turned into the town cryer and shamed your son because it made you feel good to humiliate him as a lesson.", "ESH.\n\nSo your son made an idiotic, sexist comment. It's common among teenagers, it's an asshole thing for them to do. So yes, he's an asshole. I think it's fully appropriate that he take over what he considers to be \"women's work\" until he gets that particular type of assholery out of his system.\n\nBut you couldn't leave it at that, a learning experience. You decided to publicly shame him - and you did so with apparently the biggest bunch of assholes you could come up with. Seriously? \"You made a sexist, idiotic, asshole comment at 13. Therefore you're no longer a part of the family (e.g., not invited to holidays), we're going to insult/bully you incessantly, we're going to ruin your friendships.\" You and your family utterly suck.\n\nHopefully he learns to correct his own asshole behavior, but congratulations on waking him up to yours. He will never forget how awful you are at this moment.", "YTA\n\nI'm a proud feminist, raising a boy (7) and a girl (3). They'll both know all about chores, and help whenever needed. However, they are allowed to make mistakes and say stupid things (definitely in puberty!). If you can't parent your child without involving your family as a punishment, you are doing quite poorly. Talk with your children, be a role model, explain how things are done in live. I've always wondered how young boys get under the influence of Andrew Tate and the likes, but I think I just witnessed a way. Being shamed merciless for some stupid shit you say as a 13 year old teenager (picked up easily enough from  media, friends,...), creating a divide from family and loved ones and making the world feel like a very unfair place for you. Yep, that'll do it. One pro tip in parenting: always aim to repair and create a closer bond instead of alienating your children.", "ESH. Your son was completely out of order with what he said - however you\u2019ve got no right going round shaming him to your family and consequently, his friends.", "YTA \n\nHe's 13. Being sexist isn't okay, but kids test boundaries. Teaching him that no work is gendered by taking on his sisters' chores for a week or two is totally reasonable. Turning his family against him over an off-the-cuff jerky kid comment is going way too far", "YTA. He said something stupid and likely not even something he actually believes, but probably more to antagonize. It deserved some kind of basic corrective punishment fitting for a rude/inappropriate verbal violation. You went full Capital Punishment on him as if he mowed someone down while drunk driving in the family car.  This should never have been shared with the extended family in the first place and how they are doling out their own punishments is unacceptable, WTF!  He's not sexist, he's just a typical snarky teenager. Congratulations, Bad Parent of the Year Award given.", "So you took what could have been a teaching moment at a crucial stage in his life, and instead of finding out where he was getting that from, you completely destroyed his family relations? You\u2019ve taken away everyone that\u2019s suppose to be a support system from him. You\u2019ve made it so he has no one he can rely on for guidance and mentoring in his life. He now has no trusted people he can look to to learn from his mistake. Even managed to isolate him from his friends. \n\nSo now instead of this being about righting a wrong, this is now about how his whole family turned his back on him. This isn\u2019t about the shitty thing he said, this is about the fact that he got *disowned* and completely shunned at 13. So instead of feeling bad about what he said, now all he probably feels is that the world is unfair to him, his family betrayed him, and he can\u2019t trust anyone. \n\nGood job. Instead of a teaching moment, you\u2019ve made him the victim. Solid parenting. A+. YTA\n\nNow he never learn from this mistake.", "YTA. Your punishment is disproportionate to the offense.\n\n- Your son is 13. He is still a child, he will be prone to immaturity and making mistakes. \n\n- As YOUR child, who YOU raised, he got the idea that household chores are \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d. \n\n- You mention he\u2019s now doing your wife and daughters\u2019 chores. The chores he thought were \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d, in your household are in fact left to the women. \n\n- Instead of addressing the singular behavior, you decided to brand a child a sexist (again, the child YOU raised). \n\n- Instead of wanting to help your son develop understanding, you wanted to hurt him. You wanted to shame your 13 year old son and alienate him from the rest of the family, along with his friends. Hurting is not teaching, it\u2019s abuse. \n\nI\u2019m curious, given you are a supporter of women\u2019s rights, why you are the one choosing the punishment? Shouldn\u2019t this be a matter for your wife to decide? Why does her opinion not matter compared to yours? You may want to do some self-reflection on your own behavior and mentality around gender equality. \n\nUltimately, the hatred you are displaying towards your son is not healthy or appropriate. Your wife is correct, you went way too far, and it will likely have long term damage for your son.", "YTA. You need to apologize to your son. How can you just destroy his world like that? He's 13!!!!! Kids at that age say whatever they can to get out work, regardless of if they believe it or not. What he said was pathetically tame. You overreacted big time! Apologize and keep your toxic family away from your son. YTA.", "ESH. Though it's very close to Y T A. \n\nYour son said something sexist, and apparently backed it up with some sexist reasoning (since you say he \"explained why he said it\"). But he's 13 years old and that kind of immature thinking is not unexpected. He has you and his mother to guide him and help him understand why such a thought and behavior is wrong. He's an asshole but he's still growing. \n\nYour \"punishment\" is completely failing to teach him anything. \"He deserves to lose those relationships\"? \"He'll never learn unless the consequences of his actions really hurt\"? No, you're way off base, and this is terrible parenting. \n\nYou're not teaching him that women are equal to him and to every other man. You're teaching him that if he ever voices a thought that offends women, he'll lose things. Not the same. And giving his phone to his younger sister is absolutely ridiculous. Take his phone alright, but leave your other daughter out of it and don't reward her when she didn't do anything to earn it, don't pitch your son against her by giving her his things FFS. \n\nFinally, if your nuclear and extended family has never been the kind to voice sexist opinions, you need to dig and find out where is your son getting the idea that emptying a dishwasher is women's work. Friends? Internet? Your son, who in a few years will be a man out in the world, is incorporating sexist notions from somewhere. The solution is not to make his cousins hate him. You need to actually parent him, before it's too late.", "Yta", "Congratulations! You just isolated your son from having any potential positive role models in his life. Since he is being shunned by his family and friends, the only thing left to him will be making new friends who will probably be sexist. Your punishment will likely backfire, and he will grow up to be an even bigger misogynist. Good job Dad. YTA!!!", "YTA. He\u2019s 13. It was fine making him do the chores around the house as a consequence. \nBut telling the family went too far. \nAnd the reaction of your family is extreme as well.

I was on board in the beginning but now I feel sorry for him.", "ESH he absolutely needed teaching the lesson regarding his sexcist remark but your extended family need to calm tf down", "YTA\n\nIt's all about scaling, you don't bring a real flamethrower for a game of airsoft.\n\nThe kid should have been punished yes, but the response is way too much for this case.\n\nWith no friends and no family what is stopping son from going the sexist way the moment he turns 18 ? You can't hold him back once he is 18, nobody can.\n\nYour son, as a modern day human, has the wonderful right to cut you off the moment he turns 18 and literraly disappear to begin anew from nothing somewhere else. And now you gave him a reason to do so : he has no one now whom he can trust and confide in.\n\nAn animal that has nothing to lose is the most dangerous kind, don't be surprised if you solidified his views.", "I'm sorry, but this sounds crazy. Your whole family and your son's friends have pretty much disowned him? Over that comment? Something is off here.

Like why?\n\nHe's stupid 13 year old boy. Teenegars say stupid stuff all the time. It wasn't great what he said and I agree he should  be punished, but also explained why is it not acceptable. This is such an overreaction, your son has still a lot of growing and maturing ahead of him. You and the others threat him like a criminal. \n \nI'm also quite doubtful about this story.

Kinda sounds like that not all your family is \"respect wahmen\" as you believe they are since he picked this up somewhere.", "you raised him", "He's 13. He can use their guidance. Keep this up and you're all going to push him into incel territory.", "You do realize that by pushing your son's cousins/friends who are not sexist out of his life, the only people he will have left to turn to will be sexist misogynists, don't you? \n\nYTA!!!", "They don't have to be, but they will live pretty lonely lives if they cut off everyone who has ever said something dumb as a child.", "He\u2019s 13. He needs to be guided and parented, not disowned. The nuclear option was overkill. No one is speaking to him anymore, so he\u2019s likely to go find comfort online, and when he does, the Tater tots of the world will be waiting for him. The punishment could have stopped at the chores. As a feminist mother of a teenage son myself, you took it way, way too far. YTA.", "He was raised by you....what does that say?", "Because he's not a sexist. \n\nHe made one comment, that doesn't make him a sexist. If it was a pattern of behavior then ok. But this is one comment. \n\nYou might have isolated him and taken away his entire family because of this. \n\nYou didn't need to tell thw family private business. \n\nYou could have sat down and taught him about many great women doing \"men\" things. \n\nBut you chose to go nuclear and destroy all of his family relationships. \n\nYou'll be lucky if he doesn't double down or cut you off at 18.", "He\u2019s not a sexist though. He made a sexist comment and this could have been a teaching opportunity for you.", "He is 13, maybe ask yourself where he learned this. FFS you are way worse than your son. Just wait until he disowns you. Like you deserve.", "Do you even love your son?", "He\u2019s 13, he\u2019s not anything but a kid right now!", "He\u2019s not a sexist, he\u2019s 13 that\u2019s probably picked up a shitty attitude from the internet, gaming or a friend. You correct it but don\u2019t shame him as a sexist for one stupid comment.\n\nAnd I say this as a very loud feminist.", "Must be nice to be related to so many perfect people who never step a foot out of line.\n\nYou\u2019re suppose to love and guide your child. This is abuse.\n\nYTA. A flaming one. And your family is, too.", "YTA.\n\nWhy should your son have be to friends with the AHs that are your side of the family? I was raised by a female dominated family, and not one of us would consider treating a 13 year old so atrociously over one comment. \n\nBased on your comment, you expected your family to disown him and you are glad they did.   You are going to Easter dinner without him; therefore, you have also disowned him.  You could have used this as an actual teaching moment, instead of a moment of ridicule and bullying.  \n\nDo you think for one second that your son should forgive you for this?  I don't!\n\nYour wife should seriously think about the kind of man she has married and whether or not it was a good idea that should continue.", "[removed]", "I guess if he harms himself it will be no great loss for you, his cousins, his grandparents because, well, he is all of thirteen and he said that one stupid sexist thing, clearly he isn\u2019t worth caring about and it was foolish of him to think he could ever make a mistake.", "If only he had a good role model who could help teach him that he was wrong and to not be sexist... He's a kid, he probably heard some sexist stuff from somewhere and repeated it. It's your job to teach him not to be sexist not to make sure everyone he knows treats him like a terrible person forever.", "As a female this I feel this is a bit over the top, they\u2019re young they\u2019re learning, and I mean he learned that from somewhere so maybe from YOU", " I wish I could believe that, but some of the things I've seen on the news lately..smh.", "could end up being the next school shooter ... yes the kid needs to learn a lesson but isolatiing is not just punishing the kid its causing permanent long term damage .... lets not create another andrew tate", "Im really glad the incredibly dumb shit I said as a teen wasn't during the social media era.\n\nJesus", "Exactly, and I think this quote from the post is getting glossed over. \n\nMy wife and I don't tolerate that kind of talk, so he's doing my wife, and both his sisters chores so he knows what womens work entails until further notice. \n\nI would love to know what chores the women do in their house to make him think that is women's work. Don't get me wrong, the comment is ridiculous and needed to be addressed. I think doing the sister's chores is the perfect punishment... but this comment came from somewhere.", "Exactly. The only road this will lead to is resentment against women!", "No, no, OP is correct. Why, one time when I was 6 months old I spit up my vegetables, and my grandparents disinherited me.
