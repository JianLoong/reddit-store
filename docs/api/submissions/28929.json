If you\u2019re in Canada and TD/Scotiabank I can give you a rundown of how it works lol", "NTA. By taking your car, you\u2019re actually reducing the cost for everyone because a rental would be the rental cost plus gas. You wouldn\u2019t ride in the rental ever because you would be driving your own car. But you should figure out how to split the gas charge. If it\u2019s not too far and wouldn\u2019t result in you paying more than the others splitting the rental costs, maybe you just pay for the gas in your car and everyone else splits the costs of the rental, even if they ride in your car?", "I think your offer was generous. The dude that wanted you to pay for the second rental despite supplying one vehicle was trying to freeload. Sometimes, you have to make a point. NTA.\n\nYou could reiterate your initial offer: you drive, and don't pay for the second vehicle. But if they won't do that, hold to the position that everyone's equal.", "NTA. I would drive yourself alone and force the remaining 8 to have to rent another car AND pay for it, since that\u2019s what would be going on if you didn\u2019t offer up your vehicle. You are actually making it cheaper for them bringing your own car and they have the audacity to still demand you to pay for something you aren\u2019t using? This is exactly why these kinds of trips don\u2019t interest me. Someone always gets the short end of the stick.", "NTA. You offering your vehicle to be one of the two needed is completely separate from whether or not you do some of the driving or your friend does some of the cooking.\n\nMaterial costs (cars, gas, tools, food) are separate and distinct from labor costs (driving, cooking). If you're already providing one of the two cars, you should not have to pay for any part of the cost to rent a second vehicle.", "NTA. You are absolutely right to expect not to pay for the second rental car when you have offered your car as the first.", "I think the person that does all the cooking is getting a raw deal, and he may be revisiting the arrangement he has with your group.\n\nAnd you are within your rights to withhold your vehicle.

They should\u2019ve shut down the naysayer who felt entitled to your car.", "NAH\n\nThere needs to be a more open discussion about this. I think it makes most sense to divide the AirBNB and food amongst the whole group, but transportation should be split in two.", "Nta. You are technically  correct. But is it worth making everyone mad over an insignificant  amount of money. Never let money be the cause of relationship  breakdown.", "NTA\n\nHow far away is the event, how many hours of driving and for use of your vehicle?  Because if the cost for airbnb is $500 per.person then you being excluded from that probably isnt equivalent to the financial impact of your vehicle being used. \n\n If everyone including you is splitting gas, tolls but your car has tires, oil that are impacted and your time spent driving the car is not being considered  or the risk to your car and if your car is in an accident \nare they going to split the deductible with you like they would on a rental.car?  I would learn the answer to that and have them sign something saying they will split any costs if your car is damaged or in an accident.\n\n Without knowing how far away the airbnb is for evaluating impact to your car, and the cost of airbnb it is difficult to say how fair or unfair they are being.\n\nThey are being petty because if you dont offer your car and drive yourself then the other people will be splitting an additional car rental cost because surely they wouldnt expect you to chip in for the car of gas or tolls if you are having to pay your own gas & tolls and use of your own car.   So i think it will cost them a lot more money than to have agreed to give you some amount of discount for the use of your car.   I also think they are kind of crappy friends to not have OFFERED you something for driving and use of your car. And risk to your car.  You shouldnt have to ask .\n\nBut if \"everything\" is being split why only charge them gas & tolls,  why not count oil used, wear & tear to tires,risk to your vehicle, and the amount of time you are driving and cant relax.  Im being a bit facetious, but the point is why are some costs considered but others arent. But to me you need to gain an understanding about whether they will split an damage that may arise to your car.  There could be an accident,.or maybe they spill food.and stair the seats and they need replacing, or maybe someone vomits in the car, any number of things could happen that coat to fix that you shouldnt have to cover", "The average car depreciates by $0.08 cents per mile.

I can see their side, that they weren't expecting that, given the trip was always going to happen and that, as you said, necessitates 2 cars. Since the 2 cars are imperative for the trip, I can see their side that that would be part of the overall expense, especially since gas is part of the split. I understand, and if I were on the trip, I would be more than fine with that as a compromise, but I can see how that wouldn't occur to them as overall expenses were split.", "YTA Sir this person cooling will be cooking for 9 people.
