I was able to do it through a family loan (which I'm grateful for) and a lot of grit and insane hours.

Although I have no regrets, I do want to find love. This is a topic of frequent discussion during family dinners with my parents and sister. It's not an unwelcome discussion, and my parents don't nag (they just ask normal things like \"how was that coffee date last week?\" or \"did you like so-and-so?\") and if things don't work out they don't say anything much.  \n\nNormally it's not a sad discussion, but this week I was sharing a bigger than normal disappointment in a recent failed date (we'd gone out a few times and I thought it would turn into something, but our schedules were incompatible). After hearing this, my sister piped up and said she wasn't surprised because I had \"a negative and unfeminine aura that turns away men\". My parents tried to shut her up, but she kept going on and on about how men would find my \"energy\" aggressive because I \"set too many boundaries\". \n\nShe ended with saying that I should try \"manifesting a positive love story\" and that by going into relationships with negativity I was \"manifesting failure\". \n\nI was honestly so mad at this point, that I just blurted out \"well maybe if you manifested a job, you wouldn't be fighting with \"Tom\" (her children's father) over child support payments\". She has two kids with Tom, split 50/50 custody, and tries to live off of her child support payments by staying with my parents. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with that, except she *always* complains about not having nice things (i.e. she wanted a Chanel bag and was jealous her friend got one for her anniversary), and refuses to work (my dad offered her an admin job at his company, but she \"hated sitting for so long\"). \n\nShe immediately started crying at the table, causing us to cut dinner short. My parents are trying to not take sides, but have recently asked me to apologize because my sister has been making social media posts about me \"weaponizing her poverty\" and being a bully (btw, to call herself \"poor\" is honestly a slap in the face to people actually facing poverty. She lives in a gated community in my parents' home). She refuses to come to my mom's birthday party next week if I don't say sorry. I personally feel like she deserved it, but I can tell my mom's upset. \n\nBTW, the \"boundaries\" my sister say that result in me \"manifesting negativity\" are things like me turning down a date 4th of July weekend because I own a BAKERY and it's a huge weekend for my business, requiring me to be all hands on deck pumping out pies and pastries.

She just started working a few years ago after hitting 40, and she doesn't understand why she is struggling not having built up a real career over the last 20 years and she complains about the card's life has dealt her, and don't get me wrong I have empathy for her.

So to my understanding he is trying to positively redirect the core traits he hasn\u2019t been able to change about himself. \n\nI can\u2019t say if he\u2019s a nice person or not in real life but he does have some interesting insight into what it\u2019s like living with a disorder you usually only see from someone\u2019s behavior and don\u2019t know much about their inner thoughts.", "Was coming here to comment similarly. NPD (actual clinical diagnosis in the DMV) is a Cluster B personality disorder, alongside Antisocial Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Funnily enough, there are a good few (read: scarily high numbers) people in the medical/psychiatric field who see BPD as untreatable/unmanageable and write patients off as difficult, manipulative, dramatic, *insert any other negative judgement here*, and deny them access to support and resources to treat/manage the condition. There\u2019s literally hundreds of studies and research papers evidencing negative attitude to patients with BPD as being exponentially higher than any other psychiatric condition, and the impact that has on the care and treatment that\u2019s given (or not). \n\nWhilst it may not fit the definition of \u201ccured\u201d, it is possible to reach a point in treatment for BPD that you no longer meet the requirements for the diagnosis. \n\nI think, like many things to do with mental health conditions, there\u2019s a lot of confusion, misunderstanding, and misinformation due to how the language is used/overused/misappropriated in every day life.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t mean to direct the discussion to BPD, or imply that they\u2019re the same condition. They are both Cluster B disorders, and both misunderstood and misrepresented both within the medical/psychiatric profession and in wider society. BPD is much more commonly diagnosed than NPD, so a lot of the research and studies focus on the attitudes among professionals towards BPD specifically. I\u2019d argue, given how little is understood about these diagnoses as a whole (beyond specialists) that the data collected and conclusions reached in those studies could be similarly applied to NPD (and other Cluster B diagnoses).", "Therapy, boundaries, no contact, therapy, reinforcing boundaries, therapy... \n\nHonestly, no contact followed by lots of therapy is best for those with an NPD in their life. I have chosen to remain in mine's life for my own personal reasons, but I honestly don't recommend it for most. The personal work required with my decision is difficult and constant.", "Yes! To everything you said. I work in disability advocacy, and the disgust I\u2019ve seen providers show to their patients with BPD is alarming\u2014it makes me wonder if they should be practicing at all. Based on what you said I bet we have similar opinions on the DSM. I hope that the criteria can be rewritten to emphasize the immense psychological pain these patients are in (they\u2019re not doing it for fun! It\u2019s not a choice!), but even that may not be enough to change the tide. \n\nI\u2019ve seen patients with cluster b disorders try so hard to find help, only to be met with hostility from medical providers who utilize the DSM not as a compass for treatment, but rather as a sorting mechanism to determine who is a hopeless monster who ought to be avoided at all costs. Increased visibility of these diagnoses in pop culture has not resulted in increased understanding or compassion. I\u2019ll stop ranting now. What a sad state of affairs!", "In dealing with a sister like OP\u2019s, I\u2019ve come to realize my parents always asked ME and my brother to apologize to her because they (1) knew we would and (2) it was waaayyyyyy more exhausting to correct my sister\u2019s behavior. Usually the more rational, peaceful sibling gets sh1t on because parents don\u2019t want to put in the energy to address the behavior of the problem sibling.\n\nYou might have to make some hard decisions, OP, especially if your parents always ask you to apologize and \u201cdon\u2019t choose sides\u201d when their other child is out of line.\n\nNTA", "NTA she needs to get a job!

Meanwhile there is a doctor in own family that has made between 2 and 3 million in single years. Both the average and the peak salary for things like doctors, lawyers, and a dozen other things is much bette than the average baker. Would never want any child of mine to be a baker and I laugh at someone calling that ambitious.\n\nI also know a law degree is one of the most common backgrounds of CEOs.

To avoid doing that you sometimes have to say the hard truth. So that is why I said it. Is it kind and helpful in the short run? No, it can be heartbreaking.

It used to be somewhat common that the father would leave the house, pay alimony and child support while only being a weekend dad, especially if the family was well off. This was considered less disruptive for the kids. \n\nConsidering how expensive childcare is, and that were still in a pandemic, I actually don't necessarily think it is a bad thing that someone would live with their parents so they didn't have to work while raising children. I think the issue here is that she's complaining about this when she's had opportunities to work and turned them down. I'm actually shocked the parents are putting up with this because at this rate she's never going to leave home and have financial independence, this is likely also limiting herself when it comes to things like finding a new spouse/partner.", "Sorry what? You're tripping balls fam.\n\nThis woman's only financial issue is she can't afford a Chanel bag. She lives in a gated community with mum and dad like? They're fine, they're well off.

No where does OP state that the sister doesn't receive child offer. She literally states that the sister lives off of child support.
