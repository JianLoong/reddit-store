I was able to do it through a family loan (which I'm grateful for) and a lot of grit and insane hours. The dedication  led me to miss out on a lot of things, and while I'm incredibly proud to have built something that's turned into a super popular spot in my neighborhood, I've definitely missed out on a few things.\n\nOne of which is that I'm 35 and single/childless. Although I have no regrets, I do want to find love. This is a topic of frequent discussion during family dinners with my parents and sister. It's not an unwelcome discussion, and my parents don't nag (they just ask normal things like \"how was that coffee date last week?\" or \"did you like so-and-so?\") and if things don't work out they don't say anything much.  \n\nNormally it's not a sad discussion, but this week I was sharing a bigger than normal disappointment in a recent failed date (we'd gone out a few times and I thought it would turn into something, but our schedules were incompatible). After hearing this, my sister piped up and said she wasn't surprised because I had \"a negative and unfeminine aura that turns away men\". My parents tried to shut her up, but she kept going on and on about how men would find my \"energy\" aggressive because I \"set too many boundaries\". \n\nShe ended with saying that I should try \"manifesting a positive love story\" and that by going into relationships with negativity I was \"manifesting failure\". \n\nI was honestly so mad at this point, that I just blurted out \"well maybe if you manifested a job, you wouldn't be fighting with \"Tom\" (her children's father) over child support payments\". She has two kids with Tom, split 50/50 custody, and tries to live off of her child support payments by staying with my parents. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with that, except she *always* complains about not having nice things (i.e. she wanted a Chanel bag and was jealous her friend got one for her anniversary), and refuses to work (my dad offered her an admin job at his company, but she \"hated sitting for so long\"). \n\nShe immediately started crying at the table, causing us to cut dinner short. My parents are trying to not take sides, but have recently asked me to apologize because my sister has been making social media posts about me \"weaponizing her poverty\" and being a bully (btw, to call herself \"poor\" is honestly a slap in the face to people actually facing poverty. She lives in a gated community in my parents' home). She refuses to come to my mom's birthday party next week if I don't say sorry. I personally feel like she deserved it, but I can tell my mom's upset. \n\nBTW, the \"boundaries\" my sister say that result in me \"manifesting negativity\" are things like me turning down a date 4th of July weekend because I own a BAKERY and it's a huge weekend for my business, requiring me to be all hands on deck pumping out pies and pastries.

You did not weaponize her poverty anymore than she weaponized your single status. She struck you hard, and despite being being told to stop, she kept going until you punched back. Bet she won't do that again. She is TA, not you.", "Nta. If you apologise now then she will think she can say or do whatever she wants and get away with it. You defended yourself against her attack that\u2019s on her if she doesn\u2019t like what came back at her.", "NTA. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it. And she\u2019s clearly lazy if she\u2019s turning down a job offered to her by your father.", "ESH Dinner with your family sounds delightful. You and your sister pushed each other's buttons. Both of you said things that did not need to be said. Whether the two of you want to talk about it and clear the air entirely is up to the two of you. I think your parents don't want to be in the middle and want their children to get along.", "NTA this a she can dish it out but can\u2019t take it thing.", "Neither of you were right, BUT that's what happens in sibling conflicts.  I don't think it was too far out there that you should worry over it.  Your sister does need to stop trying to manifest things and work for them though.", "I can't give you any advice because I'm too busy really, really laughing about, \"maybe if you manifested a job.\" NTA", "NTA...This sounds like  normal family give and take. Your response to your sis met her on equal ground. You owe no apologies.  She shoulda been over that before desert...or she could learn to stay outta your biz.", "NTA.\n\nBut to appease your mom, you could always apologize to your sister by saying \"I'm sorry your feelings were hurt.\" Is not really apologizing for the true statements you made...just that she couldn't handle the truth. Also doesn't really have to mean your actually sorry about what you said since your sister was extremely rude and mean to you.", "NTA. Your sister is, though. It looks like she needs to do some work on herself before judging others. She sounds like a child.\nAlso: boundaries are a good thing to have. Don't lower your standards, and don't settle.", "NTA. Tell her to manifest an apology from you and if it doesn't happen, she's just been manifesting with too much negative energy and an aggressive unsisterly aura.", "NTA - You just offered the same advice tailored to her situation.   \n\n\nOf course, it probably cut deep since she truly believes the LoA claptrap that has her convinced when life isn't going as desired or planned it's because she's not trying hard enough. Versus the reality that we can't control other people and sometimes shit just happens.", "NTA.   She wants to fling crap?  She should expect crap back.  Time to start distancing from her, she's got a.../checks notes...negative aura that turns you away.", "ESH.  What she said was wrong, but don't rise to the bait.", "NTA. \nAnd, although it\u2019s not really relevant, I disagree with your saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with her living off the child support payments. That money is meant for her children, not for her own needs.", "NTA, nuff said.", "NTA. She said mean things and fucked around and found out. If you apologize you should also get one in return.", "NTA.  Your sister seems jealous.  (I\u2019d speculate because you exerted yourself to make your business successful and consequently are able to be financially independent, whereas she is wholly financially reliant on your parents and her ex.)  You didn\u2019t \u201cweaponize\u201d her poverty, you observed it.  Are there gentler ways to point out that she isn\u2019t qualified to be giving you life advice?  Yes.  But given that her criticism of you was neither requested nor constructive, she has no right to expect you to be protective of her feelings in that moment.  I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology.", "NTA.\nYour sister is one of those people who can dish it out but can\u2019t take it. She was giving \u201cadvice\u201d that she knew would hurt you and when you returned that she decided to throw a fit. Let her have a tantrum and if anyone presses the issue tell them it is time for her to grow up.", "NTA.  Misery loves company and she\u2019s just so determined to put you down or one up you because she is unhappy with her lot in life.  If you want to be the bigger person and let her have this, that\u2019ll be really nice of you but you won\u2019t be an asshole for not apologizing.", "NTA.\n\nSis has opportunities to make more money. She just refuses to work.\n\nI agree that she should take her own advice and try to manifest money to come out of her rear end.", "Definitely NTA.  She started it, and quite frankly she sounds lazy and entitled.", "Don\u2019t start none; won\u2019t be none.  NTA\n\nIf you really want to keep the peace I\u2019d give a super non-apology just to appease your mom. \u201cSomething like I\u2019m sorry you got upset by what I said.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister more so for taking the feud to social media.\n\nI never think it's a good idea to respond 'in kind' to someone's mean remark.

Fucking heroic. Normally I try and keep a peace but you shouldn't throw stones from a glass house. The only way I would apologize in this case is \"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, don't come at my life and I won't come at yours, were sisters (I think?), can we please just get along for moms sake\". If that's not good enough then id say \"fine, your problem, don't bother me until you grow up\". Don't dish it out if you can't take it. Her bursting into tears, trying to assemble an internet army, and using her personal presence as a reverse hostage negotiation with not you, but against your mother, tells me that this person is unreasonable and if you keep caving to their narcissism it only gets worse.

She's not broke because of some reason outside her control, she's broke because she refuses to work. Shaming people who refuse to work isn't a bad thing.", "OP will continue to be roasted on SM because of this, she will be pressured by parents to apologize.  She is getting support here because she controlled the narrative.  It was a mistake to rise to the bait, that is how real life differs from reddit."]}
