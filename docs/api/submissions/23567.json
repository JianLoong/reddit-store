As mentioned before, 700 sq ft apartment, so she\u2019s all of 10 feet away from me doing this.

She is a guest and should not be lying about when she leaves it\u2019s your home. I do think blowing up was a bad move and you should definitely talk to your wife especially now that you blew up.

You are well within your rights. This lady is just using you as much as she thinks she can get away with, kick her sorry wrinkled butt to the curb and let her sleep there if thats what she wants to do lol", "If you don't want her there, then don't let her in.

Monday changed the dynamic from interfering with your home life to interfering with your work life.", "Well I definitely think you should have done it differently rather than just blowing at her. She was an ass for not respecting your boundaries and work in your own home, but I\u2019m sure you could have a better talk with her or your partner about it.", "[deleted]", "YTA for not speaking with your wife first about it.
