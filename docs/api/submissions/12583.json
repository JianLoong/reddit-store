Not that you didn't like the smell but were being made to suffer it as you ate at the dinner table, not that she was smoking around her children (I am not sure how old you are - maybe the risks of second-hand smoke weren't understood at the time), but the fact she was smoking around her asthmatic child.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She's feeling hurt because of what she did, not because of what you said.", "NTA\n\nthey tried to pick on you for something and it backfired on them.  I'd eat in my room too if it meant avoiding cigarette smoke.", "NTA\nI feel you. My mum a a heavy smoker and stank up everything. If she is hurt that's her lack of maturity. Yeah, the culture around smoking was different those days, I get that. But when people try to tell me that it was not actually bad instead of saying \"I'm sorry, it was wrong\", I get annoyed as f...\nAlso, they can pick on you for ages but not take some mild criticism? Lose me with that.", "NTA. They were making comments about you being 'antisocial' and were making fun of you for eating by yourself, and you did nothing more than tell them the truth.\n\nIt seems weird that your mom was 'hurt' by this... why? Because she jumped to the conclusion her child was 'antisocial' for eating alone? Because she caused her child to prefer eating alone to avoid her cigarette smoke? Because she failed to have a real conversation with that child for what seems to be at least a decade about eating alone?\n\nI mean, she wasn't the one forced to eat alone each night because of someone else's actions, yet she was the one 'hurt'  by this?", "NTA - She was inconsiderate for smoking while you ate, but especially with asthma. Smoke is problematic for people with asthma. The appropriate reaction from her is to feel sorry for what she did, don't do it anymore, and move on...can't change the past, but can avoid repeating mistakes.", "NTA, if she\u2019s hurt\u2026 that\u2019s unfortunately her own doing and she should reflect on that. The way you felt about her smoking near you while eating is valid.", "NTA. \n\n>they jokingly said they're surprised I didn't turn out like him. After about 10 minutes of this I finally told them why I ate alone. \n\nWhat did they expect you to do in this situation? Just sit there?", "NTA. Your mother was very selfish for doing that. If she's upset it's on her - you only told the truth.", "NTA.  Subjecting you to secondhand smoke at the dining table probably hurt you physically and long-term.", "NTA.   \nMy father did this. We all got so sick of the smell that we made him go outside if he wanted to smoke.", "NTA. Your mother's bogan behaviour is your mother's fault, not yours. She should've known better", "NTA. I hate that smell, too.", "NAH look - your mum isn\u2019t saying you were an asshole for saying it.\n\nBeing a mother is honestly 90% guilt and she\u2019s just found out she has yet another thing to feel guilty about.\n\nLet her feel upset about it.  Her feelings don\u2019t mean you were unkind or wrong to say something.", "YBTA, you easily could have explained why you wanted/were eating in your room with out your family when you were a teen, by not saying anything you allowed them to come up with their own perception of what was happening which would then turn to hurt feelings due to the fact had you said something earlier she potentially could have changed her habits so you would have eaten with the family and all of you wouldn\u2019t have lost that time together", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mom is hopefully  feeling shame for potentially  endangering her child's health.", "NTA. They labelled you antisocial when it was mom who was the issue.  She should have asked you at the time, or maybe the hurt was that you didn't tell her then.  But she should learn not to ask a question the answer to which you don't want the answer.", "NTA they asked a question and you answered it.

You\u2019re not responsible for coddling your mother\u2019s feelings from the consequences of her actions.", "Im sorry but to light up a cig while people are eating is genuinely disgusting. Nta.", "Definitely NTA. Your Mom is in massive denial about smoking and refuses to believe it impacts anyone else. My Mom was the same way. She died of lung cancer smoking (burning) 3 packs a day. She refused to believe the cigarettes caused her lung disease or caused any issues at all. My Mom\u2019s denial/addiction ran so deep she would regularly tried smoking while wearing oxygen. I wasn\u2019t usual to find 2 or more cigarettes burning at the same time. Mom\u2019s sense of entitlement to smoke when, how and where she wanted ran so deep she never met new babies born into the family. OP if your Mom admitted her smoking is hurting someone else she would have to admit it is hurting her.  My Mom could never do that.unfortunately the older my Mom got the more entitled and salty she got.", "NTA\n\nSmokers never understand the impact to others of their addiction.", "It's great that this is now practically consensus, but just 20 years ago you v where a wimp and a spoilsport and overly sensitive if you voiced that opinion. When you went to a restaurant, you were lucky if the smokers in your party didn't smoke while you were eating, but the people at the next table never waited for you. I remember travelling to Scotland in 2006 and being so delighted that we could actually go to a pub or restaurant without having to throw out our clothing afterwards.", "It\u2019s triply rude when it\u2019s your own child who has asthma. Like imagine knowing your child has asthma and STILL smoking at the table next to them while they\u2019re eating.", "It\u2019s wild that mom is hurt because OP didn\u2019t want to be eating cigarettes for dinner\n\n(For those that haven\u2019t been around smokers, the smell impacts the taste, hold your nose while you eat and see how the taste of your food diminishes)", "Smoking in the same house that your child who's asthmatic is? At the table no less, as they eat?

Restaurants inside malls don\u2019t let you smoke anymore but it\u2019s no guarantee elsewhere. I usually love to eat outside but that\u2019s almost certainly going to have smokers. I still remember flying when you were allowed to smoke inside the cabin in the \u201csmoking section\u201d - it was rough. Trapped inside a tin box with no escape for fresh air.", "The weirdest thing that happened when I moved out of my family's heavily smoking house was the withdrawals I went through. It was a couple of weeks of headaches and irritability that I didn't understand. Until I went back to visit for a week. Then it happened again. Withdrawals. \n\nI find tobacco abhorrent. But even the secondhand is \"addicting\" in a physical sense. I have never smoked myself, I am a never smoker except for that which was unavoidable and environmental.", "You do know that second hand smoke can cause lung cancer right? It\u2019s not about stunted growth", "I remember my mother whining when they got rid of smoking on airplanes...
