He is a year older but he was held back so we're in the same grade. Ever since I was little, I've felt like I don't really matter and the only reason my parents had me was for my brother to have a friend. To be clear, I'm not neglected or abused, but my parents expect me to build my entire life around my brother. When I was younger, they would always force me to do whatever my brother wants because we had to do everything together. When I wanted to learn piano and he wanted to do karate, we both had to do karate. When my friends invited me to playdates, I could only go if he could too. \n\nWhen I was really little, my parents would basically just force the other parents to take him, but as I got older, I just stopped going anywhere because I didn't want to take my brother with me. To make things worse, we moved when we were in sixth grade and it was almost impossible for me to make new friends because my brother was with me all the time. Middle school was also horrible because 7th grade was online and my brother was constantly clinging to me in 8th, Once we got to high school I just stopped caring about what my parents said and did whatever I wanted. \n\nMy \"rebellion\" mostly consisted of joining leadership and a bunch of clubs. I made lots of friends and started hanging out with them. My parents very clearly expressed their disapproval but they weren't going to lock me up to stop me from doing things without my brother. I love my brother, but being forced to share my whole life with him as a kid has made me deeply resent him. He has no friends so he just sits in his room pretty much all the time. Whenever I go out with my friends or go to extracurricular events he throws huge tantrums. I feel bad for him but I'm sick of being his constant unwilling companion and there is nothing I can do to help him. \n\nMy parents always take his side and try to make me feel bad for living my life. Our latest conflict was about homecoming. I'm a princess and I'm really excited because I couldn't go last year because I was sick. My brother asked a girl to go with him but she rejected him so he's really upset and wants me to not go because he's not going. Today there was a picnic to kick off homecoming week and he didn't go but when I got back he threw a huge tantrum when I left and was still crying when I got back hours later because he doesn't want me to go to homecoming. \n\nMy parents asked if I could just not go but I told them that I don't really care if my brother doesn't like it and he can't control my whole life. They said his mental health is suffering because he has no friends and doesn't have the best grades and watching me have fun and do great at school isn't helping. I told them that his mental health is not my problem and I'm going to homecoming whether they like it or not. My brother is still crying in his room and didn't come out to eat dinner.

We all have difficulties processing emotions in one way or another. Some, like my closest friend, don't really react to much and are very capable of going with the flow of things and never really express anger. Others, like myself, are prone to outbursts of anger and sadness, much like your brother.  \n\n\nTruth is, everyone on the autism spectrum has inherent challenges that allistics (or neurotypypicals, if you want to use that term instead) just don't have and aren't going to understand well AT ALL but will *convince* themselves that they do. I'm in my mid 20's and I still have a whole host of emotional outburst issues. I still very much struggle to make friends. I have to mask A LOT. Its emotionally exhausting, mentally draining, and creates issues with my father when I talk about work. I work at a barcade, it gets very loud. I mask to hide a lot of my reaction to it and he's prone to just kinda...ignoring it. Contrast that with my mother (may the gods bless her soul) who understood *exactly* how hard the restaurant job I had at the time she was alive was for me and would give me time to reset before getting me to do my college course work.  \n\n\nI go into all of this to provide some context to what I'm about to say: Your parents are doing neither of you ANY favors, and are probably pushing you away wholeheartedly. They basically made your childhood about HIM, not YOU because of HIS unique problems. They raised him with the routine that he gets to decide what you BOTH do. Now, I'm not going to sit here jumping to assumptions, but I do know that people on the spectrum generally arent a fan of breaks in the routine. So I dont think its out of the realm of possibility that his \"routine\" has become doing what *he* wants with you. And you're rightfully breaking that routine. Your parents have made you take a backseat in *your own life*. Its ridiculous of them to expect you to continue like that at this point. Hell, that probably should have stopped around middle school. The pandemic probably put a massive dent into any remote possibility of that happening, which probably worsened all of this.  \n\n\nYour parents need to let you live your life, and your brother needs to get used to the fact that you need to be allowed to become your own person. Thats not going to be easy for him, but it will be better for everyone in the long run.  \n\n\nI don't want to go into the full reasons why, but my siblings and I are all at a very...rough place with our father. To the point where the second all of us have the financial well being in order not need his help, we are likely to go low to no contact. I don't wish that on ANYONE. Yes, all three of us have our reasons, but it still pains me to be put in the situation where I am better off minimizing contact with my parent. If things continue the way they are for you, I could see a similar situation happening for you.   \n\n\nGood on you for standing up for yourself. Your brother is their problem, not yours.

You need to put yourself out there and fail a few times to understand it.\n\nLuckily, learning how to be social is not impossible, even for autistic people. Yes, the way \"we\" (I am using quotation marks as everyone will have a different experience) do such things is probably a bit different, but it's not impossible. Most of my contacts are online, but I consider those people my friends and I enjoy talking to them over the internet. It's less draining than being in person, so I can do it more frequently.\n\nYour brother needs to find his own friends, because he can't expect you to be always there for him. It's also important to think a bit ahead: What if you find a partner and want to start a family (assuming that's what you wish for)?

I feel really bad for him because they could be supporting him developing his own interests or helping him connect with other autistic people or a million other things but instead they seem to think that him being an unwelcome third wheel is a reasonable way to meet his needs.

Obviously I don't know where on the spectrum your brother falls, however, if your brother, who is now 16, is throwing tantrums over you going to homecoming then they have failed to help your brother develop both coping skills, social skills and his own sense of independence.  You are not responsible for your brother's emotional and social wellbeing and it's really wrong of your parents to keep trying to put that on you.

I have read so many stories on here of similar things happening, and the outcomes later on are insanely bad, all because the parents refused to do anything about it until they have lost all control.

They are all adults now, and her sisters love spending time with her because it was never forced on them - I am the parent - it was, and is, my job to look after her.

My dad called my a selfish b*tch and accused me of being jealous of my sister (not true, I truly love her despite everything, she\u2019s sweet when her needs are met). It was the lowest I\u2019ve ever been. But it opened the doors for the conversation I\u2019d always wanted to have, and my mom helped my dad understand how she had affected my life and given me too much responsibility at a young age.
