Hoping you guys can give me some insight as to if I've been inappropriate or not?\n\nLast week my niece (8) stayed with my husband and I and our two kids (M9 and M4) for the week due to my brother and SIL going on a business trip. It was my brother's business trip but he was allowed to bring my SIL along as like a mini-vacation thing so we babysat their daughter while they were gone.\n\nMy son and niece go to the same school, Son is in 3rd grade and Niece is in 2nd. They generally get along great with each other. My husband drives the kids to school and I pick them up. \n\nSo basically what happened is my son is a very dramatic child. He is the classic theater kid, but without having the theater outlet at school yet. So we are pretty silly at home because of it but it's all in good fun. On the last day of school last week as they were heading to the car to leave in the morning my son turned to the screen door, planted his face and arms against it and quietly screamed \"NOOOO!!\" as he slowly dragged himself down the door to pretended to 'die' on the ground. He's a kid, he didn't want to go to school and he was being silly. I responded be maniacally laughing and shouting through the screen door \"Go! Go suffer the school day! AHAHAHAHA!\" as I closed the door on him. He got up, laughed and went to the car. I thought all was well and good.\n\nWell apparently not because when my brother and SIL got back my SIL called me furious and yelled and me about how I traumatized her daughter by telling her to suffer at school and now she doesn't want to go anymore. Said I was being mean by laughing in their face when they had to go to school when I knew they didn't want to. (I mean of course they don't want to. They're kids) I tried to apologize but she said she was just too mad and didn't want to hear my excuses and hung up. (The way their schedule worked was they got back in time to pick her up from school that day)\n\nNow my brother is annoyed at me and said maybe I just shouldn't do that kind of stuff anymore. I thought it was harmless fun but I don't want to be one of those people who think they are having fun but actually are bullying everyone else ya know? So tell me. AITA for doing this to my son and niece? Son never mentioned anything about it and carried on like normal after school.", "created_utc": 1677589486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e5khh/aita_for_telling_my_son_and_niece_to_suffer_the/", "score": 246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you were just having fun. Whether your niece took it the wrong way isn\u2019t even the issue. The parents are choosing indignant outrage, instead of even listening to how it happened. You\u2019re not a paid babysitter that they can admonish for damaging their precious little angel. You\u2019re the aunt/uncle and obviously they know you, know your personality. To make it seem like you purposely set out to destroy their little precious angel\u2019s view on school, is insulting at best.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about whether they found it funny. You should have built up enough \u2018credits\u2019 at this point in your relationship that they instinctively know that no harm was meant. And imo, this is the real issue.", "NTA-your B/SIL haven\u2019t bothered to figure out the whole story. If they had, they would have learned that a) you were actually responding to your son, not your niece, and b) it was very clearly a joke and niece knows that, and c) that at 8yo, parents are supposed to INVESTIGATE a situation, not blindly believe their kid. \n\nParents like your B/SIL is exactly why we have a teacher shortage. They think their kids are always right. \n\nS/BIL owe you an apology, and I would make it clear to them that their attitude toward you on the phone was inappropriate. \n\nBTW-the reason why niece needed to complain about you is that she missed her parents! An 8 yo who doesn\u2019t see her parents for an entire week can act that way. She found an 8yo way to make sure her parents didn\u2019t leave again. Normal parents would know this.", "NTA.

I don't know why your brother wouldn't want to explain this to his daughter, because the alternative is to let her stay traumatized by the situation.\n\nI do think you should explain to your niece in person (probably with your son present) that you were not being serious and that the two of you were pretending. I would hope your brother and SIL would allow that, but quite honestly they should have just explained this themselves!", "NTA. You were joking around with your child. Telling a kid to \u201csuffer the school day\u201d is a pretty mundane statement lol.

It just sounds like you have a different communication style/ relationship with your son. I understand apologizing to them about the miscommunication, but I wouldn't feel bad about it. Just make a mental note to be careful how you communicate around your niece. I'm glad they are listening to their 2nd grader, but I can't believe they are only taking her side of the story.

These people sound a little *too* serious and need to lighten up a little bit. You were having fun with your child, in your home, the way it sounds like you typically would. Your niece (or her parents) can't seem to handle this. That's their problem and not yours. \n\nYour son sounds like he would be a blast to hang around with!

It sounds like your niece has a bit more serious of a household than you. She's also a year younger than your son, less dramatic than your son, etc. and has a different way of interpreting what you said. Your brother can coach his kid back into going to school and explain it was a fun game but he has no real business telling you how to run your house.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL need to get a sense of humour. They are the ones traumatizing their kid", "NAH. SIL sounds like a bit of a drama queen herself. Niece was probably more bothered by them leaving than she let on and SIL feels guilty. She spent a whole week with mom, that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want to go to school. You don\u2019t owe them to change how you interact with your own child. It sounds like they\u2019re making a mountain out of a molehill but niece clearly didn\u2019t catch the vibe. If they really refuse to recognize this then I think it just needs time to blow over.

Both dramatic over silly things.", "NTA. Tell that family to get a sense of humor.", "NTA\n\nAs others have claimed already your SIL and brother are tho for not even listening to your pov.", "NTA. That's ridiculous - your SIL should simply be thanking you for providing free childcare for her daughter while she went on a fun trip, not berating you for making a joke. The whole scenario with your dramatic son sounds very amusing and pretty cute to me. I doubt your niece was actually \"traumatized\" at all. You sound like a kind, fun aunt.", "For doing it? No. If you continue to do it to your neice, then yes. You haven't tho. You've just done it the once. Also NTA at all for doing it to your son, he seems to enjoy it. \n\n> I traumatized her daughter by telling her to suffer at school and now she doesn't want to go anymore\n\nStill NTA, and I see your sister doesn't want an apology (that's a her problem, not a you problem at this point.) That being said, it could be beneficial for your niece if you (and maybe your son?) to explain to your niece when you have to opportunity that you were kidding.", "NTA. At all. Not even a little bit.\nFirst of all, the lack of gratitude is killing me! You took care of their child as your own. \nSecond, this could be their child\u2019s way of punishing them for going away without them (I\u2019ve seen this way to many times! A child would have an amazing time away from parents, but would tell them otherwise as a an attention seeking angle or to trigger guilt for abandonment).And third, if you truly \u201ctraumatized \u201c their child, rather than explaining the situation to her they got angry with you?! This is over sheltering and bound to harm the child in the long run!", "NTA. They need to lighten up because they\u2019re teaching their daughter to be dramatic, but not in the fun way. You sound like a great parent, keep it up!!", "NTA explain what exactly happened then say you will never change how you interact with your kids and if they cant deal with it they need to find someone else to babysit.", "WTF even is this? Is this real?? NTA unless you know something about your niece not being able to handle this kind of joking around. Is she very literal?", "Esh. Mainly you. \n\n\nIt does t sound as if sil and your brother knows what happen. Nor does it sound like the niece fully understand what happen either. \n\nIk you were having fun but she's in the second grade she cant tell if you're serious or not. It doesn't sound like you tried to explain what happen to your brother.", "NAH\n\nThere are people which find dark humor funny most of the time and people who never find it funny.   You now know where your niece is on that scale.  You now know not to use that kind of humor around her.\n\nDo what you can to apologize and control the damage.", "Guess not right lol FAFO", "Nope. Lol", "I would not do this. We don\u2019t know what the niece said exactly and how the parents interpreted it. Talking with the niece could turn a mole hill into a mountain. What if it\u2019s the parents who are making this into a big deal and the niece has already forgotten about it?

Your SIL can stay home now and you don't have to worry about an extra child.", "NTA. Does your niece tend to take things very literally and have trouble understanding jokes a lot of the time? If so, it might be time for a screening for autism and other mental health conditions. 8 years old is old enough to understand when someone is joking around, so she might have something else going on. It's also possible that she's having a bad time at school for some reason and needs support there.", "In my opinion:\n\nWow. Yeah definitely NTA. Her kid obviously didn\u2019t inherit her parents lack of humor.", "Boy was I concerned when you called your kid dramatic. You are a great parent. Keep it up! This is how you turn little humans into successful, healthy adults. NTA", "Your son is lucky to have you and your humor. My son (and I) are also very dramatic. When he loves something, like a new food or a fantastic piece of clothing, he pretends to faint, and I fan him back to life. We also laugh openly, dance in stores, hug violently, and say inappropriate things to each other born from our dark humor and love of Wednesday Addams. He is 9, and we have been like this since he was old enough to talk. My cousin is like my sister, and she has two kids that we see often. I can promise you that her kids are not traumatized by us, because they know we are silly. You are NTA at all here, but you may want to sit down with your niece and talk to her about your sense of humor. One of my cousins kids is the sweetest human on the planet, but we have discussed our inappropriate sense of humor with him, so he knows we are just being silly. He even joins in on the silly with us sometimes now. He is a very literal kid, so making sure he knows we are joking went a long way in his comfort. That being said, your SIL does not get to dictate your relationship with your kid, whether you discuss it with your niece or not.", "NTA but maybe it might be worth speaking to your niece about it. It sounds like she didn't realise it was a joke and thought that you genuinely wanted them to suffer. I know, it seems obvious to you and your kiddo, but sometimes kids don't always pick up on an obvious joke and if something seems a little mean or menacing, it can get to them.\n\nSit down with her and apologise for scaring her, but you were just trying to be dramatic and silly. You're her auntie, so of course you love her and don't want her to suffer. Offer plenty of hugs and reassurances if need be.\n\nThis could be a great bonding moment for you two if you take the time to work it out with her.\n\nHer parents sound like they suck, but that doesn't mean this isn't fixable.", "NTA - it was a misunderstanding by your niece. She didn't read your son's behavior correctly and therefore misread your response to him, your SIL is definitely overreacting.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt was obviously in good fun. \n\nI'd send a message to your brother, that it's best he find other childcare in the future, that you don't appreciate the abuse instead of thanks, from their direction.", "NTA Time to end the free childcare service.", "NTA. They sound exhausting. I joke with my kids all the time, and that\u2019s an important part of our relationship.

It is, at best,  lightly tanned humor.", "NTA.\n\nApparently your son isn't the only overly dramatic one in the family.\n\nYour niece either told her parents the line and they freaked out without getting the context or your niece is playing them and trying to get out of school by blaming you.", "NTA, lol. I totally understand where you're coming from, because we do a lot of this stuff as well. SIL needs to put some more energy into her parenting, seems like. Every child is different, I get it, but 8 years old is way enough to understand basic humor and wordplay (like \"suffer the school day, HAHAHAHA!\") Our 8 year old frequently comes up with her own jokes - granted, they're mostly about poop, farts, vomiting and dying (courtesy of our latest reading, \"Kay's Marvellous Medicine\") - and would've loved the bit you and your son did. Regardless of all this - even if SIL's kid didn't get the joke, SIL should've just explained. It's not rocket science.", "NTA SIL sucks. What a crazy reaction! Every parent knows that you don't just go by what your kid says!! You ask others about the situation to get context and find out the full story. I guess she'll have to find alternate childcare the next time she wants to go away for a week without her kid.", "NTA.

Abuse at home? Is she un-diagnosed on the spectrum?   \n\n\nMy half brother is on the spectrum and my Mom did not tell me. I am about 19 years older than him. She basically called me a few states over after being semi-estranged for years and asked me to babysit for kids I've never met. I jumped at the chance to get to know my half-siblings without having to deal with my Mom. It sounded perfect.   \n\n\nMy one brother seemed a bit \"off\" but I was a stranger in his house so I chalked it up to that. One day I turned on the vacuum and my brother had a nuclear meltdown. I was dumbfounded. My other brother explained, as best he could for his age, how his brother didn't like loud noises, or certain textures, etc. Of course then I realized what was going on. Poor kid. My Mom figured she wouldn't get her \"Free Babysitting\" if I thought the boys would be hard to deal with. They weren't once I understood their issues.   \n\n\nI wonder if the early morning time and the loud dramatic laughing was just \"too much\" for the poor girl.

Have some fun with it, for crying out loud.", "NTA   \n\n\nI think your niece witnessed the equivalent of an inside joke between you and your son. \n\nShe didn't get the joke, probably because she's only 8 and didn't grow up around these sort of theatrics. I bet she was confused, talked to her parents to look for guidance, but off course as she was eight and didn't understand what happened she was unable to explain the story in all it's nuances.   \nHer parents misunderstood and made it worse because their reactions showed this is something to be upset and traumatized about, and so that's the emotional behavior the niece conformed to. \n\nIf you want to mend bridges tell them you're sorry you excluded her from an inside joke and by doing so caused a misunderstanding. \n\nDon't feed into the 'it was traumatizing' narrative that her parents came up with, because in the long run that'll only hurt the kid more.", "NTA Tell them as your parenting bothers them no more free childcare or carpool.
