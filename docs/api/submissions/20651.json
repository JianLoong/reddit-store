{"id": 20651, "submission_id": "14jj4rz", "title": "AITA for buying an investment property against my partners wishes?", "selftext": "30f. Been with \"John\" for 12 years now. For the past 6 years I have desperately wanted to flip houses. I've wanted to do this since I was a kid but these past 6 years is when I really started to get a bit fixated on it. Every single year I bring it up to my partner and every single year he says \"that would be fun\" and he will help me search for fixer-uppers but it's like he goes out of his way entirely to turn me against every single property that I want, that's within budget. Then, after a month or two of searching with me, he will find reasons why it can't happen this year. \n\nLast year really sucked. I have all my own money saved. It's not like I need him financially or even need his approval honestly BUT given that this is the love of my life, I do want his approval, you know? So I've just sucked it up and given in to the \"well it probably won't happen this year but it can be our 5 year plan\" talks. But again, last year sucked because I found a property that I was absolutely in love with. I wanted it in the worst of ways. It was an old victorian home with 6 bedrooms, built in bookshelves and dressers, etc etc. It was only $6k. It needed work, obviously. The electric was bad, the plumbing was bad but there was no water damage and the roof/beams/frame was solid. I know how to do plumbing but electric would have been an issue. That would have been a thing I hired someone to do and it would have cost a good penny BUT the place was only $6k. I had well over $80k saved. I pulled numbers from the surrounding homes and the RSV was roughly $190k for the area. I wanted it, desperately, and he found a reason for me to not get it (ie: \"it's in a bad part of town\"). So, I didn't get it. \n\nWell, I stepped away from it all. I got a bit discouraged and just stopped looking. But I went on last week and that property was still listed. Same price. So, I told him I was getting it. I want it. He tried telling me it was a bad idea, there was too much work that needed to be done (I have the construction experience, he only has chef experience). I went and looked at it anyways. I determined that with my connections (dad and uncle- who both do construction, other uncle who does foundations, me- who does plumbing) it would only run me top dollar of $50k to renovate and I signed on the property and closed the same day for cash. He's mad at me for doing it and thinks it's a dumb investment.\n\nETA: we do not have merged finances. It is my money going in to the place. I understand house flipping is something that is often looked down on to some people. I'm not doing it is a \"get rich quick\" thing. The profit would just be a bonus. I truly just love renovating and it's something I've always wanted to do. If I fail, which I might, I'm not going to go cry about it.", "created_utc": 1687790364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jj4rz/aita_for_buying_an_investment_property_against_my/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His son is the one who showed me the home (with the real estate agent and appraiser). He said he has no use for it and wants it gone.", "While I agree with you, I don't think eminent domain is something OP needs to worry about since she would still likely recoup everything she put in when they assessed the property for fair market value. If OP completely renovated the house to a proper standard, she would likely still make money since the other properties in the neighborhood are worth $190k. \n\nThe only issue would be if the city claimed eminent domain before the renovations were completed and the house was still in poor condition.

An inspector would be required to determine whether the property was in livable condition; and to what extent the damages are. \n\nI would not trust the structural safety of a 6K property.

Last time I saw a house that cheap it was just the house and it had to be moved onto new land.", "Did you get your own appraisal, or just trust the guy he provided. Have you checked your city comp plan? Or state/federal land contamination warnings?

But even 60k, where is this? Like just give a country and a state/province.", "They would only have to assess her fair market value for what is taken, and you are assuming the whole property would be taken. More often you'll fine portions of the property taken with the return rate being laughable, and the end result being the property is now unsellable For example, when a 2 lane rural road becomes a 6 lane highway, houses along it might have the first 30 meters of setback taken, and be paid maybe 10-25k because the house itself isn't touched. But now the house is right against a 6 lane local highway and is unsellable.\n\nHaving your entire property taken is usually a great deal, and would help her in this case. But that's not the usual/common use for this sort of thing.", "If other houses in the neighbourhood are worth 190 and she paid 6, you don't think at some point in the last year someone else would have bought it, even for the land?

Any associated fees. The time.", "He says it's a \"bad area\", but he says that about every house I look at. Every home that he's wanted me to get is somewhere out in Florida (we live 26hrs driving distance from Florida so it's unrealistic).", "Yep, big on covering up problems instead of fixing them.", "Yeah that's a negative not a positive.", "That's not how leins work. They don't transfer like that. Upon sale of the property the lein would have to be paid off. Can't sell if a lein is on place. That's the point of them.", "I guess I misunderstood your original comment. I live in a small town so that vast majority of eminent domain issues we have here involve the city taking the whole property for some major project. \n\nYou're definitely correct about what would happen if they were only taking part of the property to widen a road/put in additional lanes or whatever. Still, those types of projects usually take years to plan and get approved, and they have to notify the public by putting everything on file in the city planning office. \n\nAs long as OP made sure there weren't any such proposed plans, she should still be in the clear. If there is already any type of plan or even proposal in place, then she's screwed as the value of the property is likely already vastly decreased.", "Absolutely. I'm not debating that at all, and something definitely seems extremely fishy both because of the price and how long it sat on the market. My point was merely about eminent domain and how they assess fair market value. If she were somehow able to renovate the home so it's up to code and a similar standard to the other houses in the neighborhood (which seems highly doubtful since no one else jumped on this \"incredible deal\"), the house would almost certainly appraise at a similar value to all of the others on that street.", "No, I mean have you talked ot him about why he's clearly against the idea in general.", "Not always true. HOA dues and excess fines can be written to follow the title rather than the owner, same with some construction and city fines. They aren't always covered at sale of the property, but will be reassessed after transfer. It depends on what state/country you are in.", "He's just different than me. Doesn't like getting his hands dirty and likes finished projects. He has been a chef his whole life and has no background on homes or what it takes to maintain/fix them. So to him, buying a fixer-upper is a burden that would do nothing but inconvenience him. To me, it's the opposite. I love doing it.

It's your decision.\n\nThat said- I think you need to have a sit-down, forthright conversation with about what his concerns are, why every year he goes from \"yes to not right now.\"\n\nThis is your thing. Your money. You get to say- this is my fun thing that I'm going to spend my fun money on, even if I lose every penny. And that's okay.\n\nThe reality is that you have experience in construction. You have family in construction. You probably have friends in construction.

Needless to say, don\u2019t expect him to pick up a paintbrush or screwdriver toward your project.", "NTA. And I love that you're restoring a Victorian house. I love old houses with character. This is your hobby and your project. Sometimes, you just have to keep your hobbies separate. Your money isn't tied together, so I say, more power to you.  He probably won't complain if you end up making money on this.", "YTA\n\nYes buying a house without your partners okay is definitely an asshole move. All major decisions should require either 2 yesses or 1 no. Especially ones that have significant impact on both partners. And yes, there is a high likelihood that this affects your partner. Any loan you take out for this project will affect your partner. Any extra time commitment you make to this project will affect your partner. Any major financial setback will affect your partner.
