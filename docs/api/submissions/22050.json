I forgot to throw away the bag it came in and left it on the table.\n\nMy wife comes home from work at about 4:50pm and I hear her go into the fridge. Then she asks where her food is at that I ordered. I told her I didn\u2019t get her anything because I figured 1. She didn\u2019t want to heat up a cold fast food, which is kinda gross and 2. She would\u2019ve already had lunch at work or was planning on what her and I would cook for dinner later.\n\nShe said I was an asshole for not thinking of her or asking her if she wanted anything to eat since I was ordering. I told her that I ordered it for my lunch nearly 5 hours ago and didn\u2019t think it mattered, since it didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t eat lunch together when we were both in separate workplaces.\n\nAnyone have any insight on this?", "created_utc": 1689184245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvkm5/aita_for_not_ordering_my_wife_food/", "score": 1467, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s been venting to me that she\u2019s worried about the future of her career.\n\nAnd a little over three weeks ago, her car broke down and the cost to repair it is pretty steep.

I was considering discussing the feasibility of only having one car with her anyway before that happened.\n\nWhen we met, I was making way less than her, so she was the one who had more money for dates and doing special stuff for me, just because. She was the one who lived independently. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she wasn\u2019t living in luxury and if anything happened to her job, she would\u2019ve only had a few weeks worth of funds before being in a dire financial situation. But she was an independent woman and that\u2019s all that really mattered to her.\n\nAfter we got married last year, I found a job that paid quite a bit more than her. The commute was about an hour though and after about 9-10 months of doing that commute I started looking again, found this job that\u2019s WFH and pays similar.\n\nShe said she\u2019s embarrassed because she now feels dependent on me. She said seeing that bag of fast food felt like a slap in the face because it shows that I have enough to do with money and I don\u2019t need to think about it while she feels like she needs to work many more hours to contribute financially in any significant amount. I found that odd because in my mind as a married couple, it\u2019s our money to use however one of us deems necessary, without \u201cpermission\u201d from the other. Sure, she might be using my (in name only) debit card for some stuff right now, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, she still has every right to do with it as she wants since she\u2019s my wife.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m such an asshole because she\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t even think about her at all when I ordered that food. I just saw the lack of leftovers that could easily be microwaved (she ended up getting hungry and eating that last night after I went to sleep) and only some bread and eggs to make a quick sandwich. The remainder of the food was raw chicken and vegetables, which would\u2019ve taken most of my lunch break to prepare, never-mind eat. I just opted to order something quickly on my phone about 10 minutes before lunch, mop the floors as I waited about another 10-15 minutes into my lunch break (which is 30 mins) for it to be delivered, and eat.\n\nI never even considered what she might be feeling and that makes me the AH. \n\nThanks for your input and points of view, everyone.

But as a long term GF who gets internally disappointed at stuff like this, maybe a little insight/guestimation to her thoughts:\n\nI also don't eat lunch at work. I hyper fixate and often don't feel hungry until I'm relaxed at home. My partner starts work about the time that I get off work. When I come home, I tend to stare at the cupboards and fridge for a while, uncertain what to eat. Sometimes, something sounds good and I'll cook, but often I'm tired and just want instant gratification foods (I find grab and go snacks helpful. Uncrustables, crackers, anything I don't have to wait on, etc). If my partner ordered food while I was at work, I sometimes see the bag and want to eat absolutely nothing but food from that place. It sounds good, smells good, and over rides all other cravings. So I get upset that he couldn't wait to eat with me. I keep it inside, and we talk about it when it's bad, but sometimes I get in my feelings about it. \n\nMy guess, is she probably faced a similar thing. Maybe she hopes you would have snacked, and ordered food closer to her being home. Maybe she's upset from work, and now craving the food now that she's seen the bag. Maybe she assumed since the bag was still out, that you ordered recently, and she got upset before having the facts. \n\nMy advice: From time to time, order something for her to come home to.
