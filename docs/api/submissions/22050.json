Unfortunately, I\u2019m still bound to a work schedule and need to take lunches as assigned and such.

For whatever reason, there was no food to eat for lunch. At least nothing that I could quickly make and eat within 30 minutes. So I just ordered something from a delivery app. I go ahead and order from a fast food place a few minutes before my lunch and finish it right before I clock back in to work. I forgot to throw away the bag it came in and left it on the table.\n\nMy wife comes home from work at about 4:50pm and I hear her go into the fridge. Then she asks where her food is at that I ordered. I told her I didn\u2019t get her anything because I figured 1. She didn\u2019t want to heat up a cold fast food, which is kinda gross and 2. She would\u2019ve already had lunch at work or was planning on what her and I would cook for dinner later.\n\nShe said I was an asshole for not thinking of her or asking her if she wanted anything to eat since I was ordering. I told her that I ordered it for my lunch nearly 5 hours ago and didn\u2019t think it mattered, since it didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t eat lunch together when we were both in separate workplaces.\n\nAnyone have any insight on this?", "created_utc": 1689184245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvkm5/aita_for_not_ordering_my_wife_food/", "score": 874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
