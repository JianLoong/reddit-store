I forgot to throw away the bag it came in and left it on the table.\n\nMy wife comes home from work at about 4:50pm and I hear her go into the fridge. Then she asks where her food is at that I ordered. I told her I didn\u2019t get her anything because I figured 1. She didn\u2019t want to heat up a cold fast food, which is kinda gross and 2. She would\u2019ve already had lunch at work or was planning on what her and I would cook for dinner later.\n\nShe said I was an asshole for not thinking of her or asking her if she wanted anything to eat since I was ordering. I told her that I ordered it for my lunch nearly 5 hours ago and didn\u2019t think it mattered, since it didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t eat lunch together when we were both in separate workplaces.\n\nAnyone have any insight on this?", "created_utc": 1689184245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvkm5/aita_for_not_ordering_my_wife_food/", "score": 472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely agree with you\u2026 what would she expect to have? Soggy Taco Bell?", "She thought you ate dinner with out her and didn't order her anything because the restaurant bag was still out. When she found out it was for your lunch, she was already irritated and hangry, so she didn't want to back down. Just order dinner tonight and tell her you love her. she will get over this minor tiff.", "INFO: What is going on in your relationship that she would pick a fight with you about this? You said that you left the bag out and you knew somehow that was a mistake. Is there a pattern?", "She just saw the bag, and got that \"ooh, a treat\" feeling. She just didn\u2019t realize that bag was from 5 hours ago. Your only mistake, OP, was not tossing out the bag. NTA", "not enough information.\n\nYou saw at lunch there was no food.  Did you prepare a grocery order ?  lodge it online and try to get groceries for the evening", "NTA with respect to the fast food lunch. \n\nHowever, Y T A for depending on your wife for dinner planning and not having noticed food was running low in the fridge and doing something about it so you had to (chose to) pay an exorbitant amount for fast food delivery. \n\nYour wife over reacted. Statistically, your best action is for you to apologize and promise it will never happen again. Then suggest joint meal planning once a week and offer to take over grocery shopping.", "OK so I'd say not TA for not ordering her food that would be sitting there for 5 hours and be long cold but YTA for leaving the mental load of groceries/food to your wife. You're an adult, it's your responsibility too.\n\n> For whatever reason, there was no food to eat for lunch\n\nYou didn't buy groceries, that's the reason why. It's not your wife's job to keep the fridge stocked for you.\n\n> At least nothing that I could quickly make and eat within 30 minutes.\n\nReally? Not even a Sandwich? \n\n> She would\u2019ve already had lunch at work or was planning on what her and I would cook for dinner later.\n\nWhy didn't you plan what to eat for dinner and get the groceries? Or ask your wife to bring what you need for dinner on her way and than cook it for her? You're an AH if you leave all meal planning to your wife.", "NTA, if she was heading home for lunch and you knew and didn't get her something, yes. If she was ALSO working from home and you didn't even ASK her if she wanted something, yes. But she was in a completely different building with a completely different schedule than yours. If I came home at 4:30 and my husband was like \"there's some burger king on the counter..\" I would be confused. That's too late for lunch and almost too close to dinner for a full meal let alone cold fast food.", "NTA  can there be an update so we can have some sliver of understanding of where she is coming from.\n\nSeems a little insane", "INFO what restaurant was it?", "NTA - but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a love language thing. She buys groceries and handles food and providing for him is caring for him. She doesn\u2019t even do that for herself for lunch. So when he ordered his food and not hers, he was being thoughtless in her eyes. She wants that same caring.", "NTA\n\nWhat is her thought process here for this ridiculous request. Does she usually keep insulting you after you explain things to her?", "Nta. I wouldn't order for anyone especially since I would have assumed they bought their food at work as well. She should have also texted to inform you that she would want you to order her food as well. I don't know why people think we have to by psychics and read minds.", "NTA she's being irrational", "NTA This is an easy one", "NTA!   When she goes out to eat with co-workers,  does she bring you home food?    I doubt it.  Sorry to say but your wife sounds a lot like my crazy ex-wife.", "NTA, delivery take outs these days are very common and it's not like the delivery fee is so high that you have to order more food to justify it. Unless you ordered it just before she was meant to get back home there is no reason whatsover why you would get food for her too.", "You\u2019re NTA, but on the future I\u2019d just text \u201chey, I\u2019m ordering Applebees for lunch, you want me to get you anything for when you get home this evening?\u201d  Most likely she was just hangry!  But it will let her know you were thinking of her. \n\nAgain NTA!!!!  There was no reason to assume she\u2019d want something hours later. Now they you know, just be sure to ask in the future. It will mean a lot to her!", "NTA\n\nIt was a whole different mealtime from when you ordered. If she wasn\u2019t home and wasn\u2019t going to be home for hours, of course you don\u2019t have to order for her.", "NTA at all. However, I would offer to get her food next time, and it might suggest meal prepping so you both have lunch.", "YouR wife is the AH", "NTA.  Your wife is being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nLunches are FFY and dinners are together. \n\nBoth my wife and I work from home and we fix food separately or we order separately", "NTA - It was 5 hours ago, and she wasn't going to be home any time soon. I honestly don't see the reasonable expectation.", "Info: Did she think you ordered supper and didn't ask her if wanted anything?", "NTA. Any chance she posted here earlier? With less info. Lol", "NTA", "NTA. No reason for you to order her lunch, she was at work. This is nuts that she\u2019s mad.", "NTA\u2026", "NTA, she wasn\u2019t home so why would you order her anything?\nPeople who expect you to order food for them when they aren\u2019t home are so weird", "NTA. Sounds like she was hangry.", "NTA.  But you could order delivery for dinner.  Ijs", "NTA", "NTA but rookie mistake. Always get something for the wife.", "NTA. She seems hangry. Feed and revisit.", "NTA", "So let me get something straight... you were supposed to order your wife takeaway when she wasn't even there to eat it?? WTF? NTA.", "Divorce immediately", "That's a dick move considering you're her husband. If I'm ordering, I'm asking her or ordering something for her. Fast food or not, cold or not. You said there was nothing to eat at home.", "Same, I honestly don't understand her thought process or I guess lack there of", "Yes, totally. If this isn\u2019t normal behavior, it\u2019s just a person who has had a bad day and thought she wouldn\u2019t have to cook. When she found out she did, she had a little hangry, stressed meltdown. We\u2019ve all been there!", ">If she was home or you expected her to be home shortly after ordering it would be a different story.\n\nThat's the only thing I can think of where a \"why tf didn't you order me something as well?!\" would be appropriate. Like, he'd only just eaten it before she got home (instead of dinner together), which she might have thought because he forgot to dispose of the evidence. But hearing that he got himself some takeout for lunch hours ago? That should have been an \"oh, okay, never mind\". NTA.", "It\u2019s simply just our arrangement. I do the laundry and the general cleaning throughout the day because I\u2019m at home. She does the shopping and food. She does the dirty dishes and I put them away (that was actually her preference when we first starting living together.) And we take out the trash together.\n\nIt\u2019s more or less the same splitting of chores we\u2019ve done in the past 3 years of living together. I just added on doing all the cleaning while before she would vacuum and I would mop. She\u2019s always just done grocery shopping after work and she genuinely enjoys cooking.\n\nWhatever chores she didn\u2019t want to when we first moved in together, I just took over lol", "If that's their chore split, it absolutely is her job. Individual couples split chores differently.", "How are y'all warming up your food?\n\nBecause if you're not using **a combi oven**, you should be. Even hours-old fries turn out great if you put them in at like 10% humidity at 260F.", "Ugh, microwave reheated fries are the saddest food... Air fryers have changed the game", "Holy crap I could not imagine going through the workday with no food.   I meal prep and even with a substantial morning snack (I don't eat breakfast), a full lunch and small afternoon snack, I'm usually still hungry.", "Because the mess in the kitchen was still around, did your wife think you had only just bought and eaten the food?   If she has a sliding lunch time and tidies as she goes them she might not have realised that the empty containers were from food you bought some hours ago.", "It wasn't a big deal.  Don't let her gaslight you into thinking it was.  She's being insane about this.   My husband and I are in the exact same situation as you and your wife (except he does the cooking as well since he's home to do it) and it would never even occur to me to have him order me something for lunch when I'm not home until after 5 anyway.   That's bananas.  Sometimes if he finds out I went to lunch at a place he likes he'll tease me about not bringing him anything home but we both know he's not being serious.  Because that would be crazy.", "I don't want 5 hour old fast food. It's been sitting in the fridge for all that time.", "I \u2764\ufe0fmy air fryer  even more than my family ( sometimes) lol", "Ehh, since you've posted this reply there's another 8 replies that aren't NTA, and are either making excuses for OPs partner or trying to figure out if there's a way to minimalise her AHness.", "My mum lives off pistachios, black coffee, and wine. What kind of mum is that?", "i doubt that a lot since she seems to be accustomed to it", "Depends on the break room.  Some are stocked with snacks.", "MOAR FOR ME!", "Completely understandable.", "I visited a friend recently who I think is turning into an almond mom. At like 4pm she mentions how she\u2019s fine cause she had a yogurt earlier. I said that was at like 10am?? What? Ahhaha", "winemom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine\\_mom", "Oh she defs an almond mom!", "I got really accustomed to it during my eating disorder. Didn't make me less grumpy!", "You can be accustomed to it and yet still get hangry. I forget to eat a lot during the day minus a couple snacks. Thats unfortunately pretty normal for me, but my roommates still point out that they noticed when I get hangry. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "If she is snacking but not actually eating proper meals she is just revving up her blood sugar and insulin throughout the day, definitely setting herself up for hangry", "Like not to be cruel but there's a reason people with eating disorders can be really mean", "Well I'll be a monkeys uncle.", "your point, while still valid, is kinda moot in this situation bc you missed the very next sentence, where he says she uses *his* debit card to buy groceries. \n\nlike yeah that might make life easier and is a very good piece of advice, but its not the issue in this situation", "He mentioned above in a comment in this thread that his wife uses his debit to pay for the groceries, not hers.", "I giggled at this.", "hm yea I didn't see that thanks."]}
