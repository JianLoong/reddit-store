I forgot to throw away the bag it came in and left it on the table.\n\nMy wife comes home from work at about 4:50pm and I hear her go into the fridge. Then she asks where her food is at that I ordered. I told her I didn\u2019t get her anything because I figured 1. She didn\u2019t want to heat up a cold fast food, which is kinda gross and 2. She would\u2019ve already had lunch at work or was planning on what her and I would cook for dinner later.\n\nShe said I was an asshole for not thinking of her or asking her if she wanted anything to eat since I was ordering. I told her that I ordered it for my lunch nearly 5 hours ago and didn\u2019t think it mattered, since it didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t eat lunch together when we were both in separate workplaces.\n\nAnyone have any insight on this?", "created_utc": 1689184245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvkm5/aita_for_not_ordering_my_wife_food/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She could be ordering take out with coworkers sometimes but I doubt it.

Her office is right next to a grocery store, so she will stop in and shop after work on the days she gets out at like 3:30 or 4:30. Because she\u2019s usually the one who cooks, I assumed she knew we were low on food and would\u2019ve bought after work like she usually does. Other times when we needed food and she didn\u2019t go shopping, we would just run out grocery shopping together after work. \n\nThere was bread and some cheese to make a grilled cheese, and some cereal I could\u2019ve made for lunch.

She said \u201cwell it doesn\u2019t matter because I would\u2019ve thought of you and asked if you wanted anything to eat.\u201d Which is a moot point in my opinion because that scenario of her being at home and I\u2019m away for a bit has never existed. If I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m probably at home anyway and when I am gone, I\u2019m either with her anyway or visiting my parents.
