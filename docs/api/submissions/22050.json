Unfortunately, I\u2019m still bound to a work schedule and need to take lunches as assigned and such. My wife [30M] does not work from home and works at an office with varying hours. \n\nAny way, yesterday my lunch was at 11:30am, and my wife was at her job until 4:30pm. For whatever reason, there was no food to eat for lunch. At least nothing that I could quickly make and eat within 30 minutes. So I just ordered something from a delivery app. I go ahead and order from a fast food place a few minutes before my lunch and finish it right before I clock back in to work. I forgot to throw away the bag it came in and left it on the table.\n\nMy wife comes home from work at about 4:50pm and I hear her go into the fridge. Then she asks where her food is at that I ordered. I told her I didn\u2019t get her anything because I figured 1. She didn\u2019t want to heat up a cold fast food, which is kinda gross and 2. She would\u2019ve already had lunch at work or was planning on what her and I would cook for dinner later.\n\nShe said I was an asshole for not thinking of her or asking her if she wanted anything to eat since I was ordering. I told her that I ordered it for my lunch nearly 5 hours ago and didn\u2019t think it mattered, since it didn\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t eat lunch together when we were both in separate workplaces.\n\nAnyone have any insight on this?", "created_utc": 1689184245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xvkm5/aita_for_not_ordering_my_wife_food/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that your wife was at work and wouldn't be home for several hours makes a difference. It wouldn't be reasonable for you to order her something.", "NTA\n\nI work from home 2/3 days a week.  Wife has summers off.  If either of us are home alone, we 95% of the time have left-overs.  The other 5%, we order or go grab something.

Are you guys watching your budget?\n\nI just offer up that as a compromise. \u201cTreat yourself to fast food lunch out tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIf she was eating out anyway then I genuinely I\u2019m confused and you\u2019re even more NTA.\n\nHer response seems a bit childish to be honest as well", "NTA\n\nIt was for your lunch.", "NTA.

Why were you surprised there was no food in your own home, and how do you not know how that happened? And when you noticed you were now magically out of food, did you consider what dinner was going to be like and if you should text your wife to discuss this mystery of the empty fridge and how it would solve itself for dinner?", "NTA", "NTA. Why can\u2019t she just order her own food and have it fresh?", "NTA - If she was home or you expected her to be home shortly after ordering it would be a different story.\n\nThat being said, you may want to have a conversation with your wife about expectations when it comes to food in your relationship to avoid these types of confrontations in the future.", "NTA. I second the questions about why would she want 5-hour-old fast food. I wouldn't die on this hill, but if she feels slighted, apologize for not asking, then change the subject to planning other meals, together. It's not a big thing, really, unless she generally feels like you are treating her like an afterthought, which certainly merits a discussion.", "NTA. That doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. If you\u2019d just ordered it knowing she\u2019d be home soon, that would be one thing, but unless she made or ordered a portion of her lunch for you, why would you be expected to do that for her?", "NTA.\nAh, does she expect you to ask at every single meal every work day if she wants food?\nThis is a weird hill to die on.", "NTA- I never get annoyed if my hubby orders food while he is working.   Its not like she was physically there to eat the food when you ordered. She has just as much access to getting food, so she could order her own.", "NTA. I legitimately can't imagine any circumstance in which I would even think to ask my partner if he wanted me to order him anything with my order when he wasn't home and wouldn't be for hours. You are both independently responsible for your own lunches - that's not the least bit complicated. Is it possible there was something else going on here? Because that's how unhinged this situation sounds to me.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is being silly and she knows itZ", "Nta. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with her but ummm. I might make the joke to my husband where my food was\u2026but it would just be a joke. 5 hr old fast food is NASTY.

I ask because I'm like 80% sure that my husband does and he pulled the same crap when I took our kids out to lunch while he was sleeping (he works nights) and when he woke up around dinner time he commented that I didn't get him anything... even though it was also about 5 hours after lunch. The next time I took them out when he was asleep I bought him food, he ate it out of obligation but 5 hour old fast food that you have to reheat is a struggle meal and no one actually wants to eat it", "NTA. This is what keeps me happily single \ud83d\ude02 The fact she just expected it to be ordered for her, and couldn't just accept that you had fast food for lunch on your own makes her the A H here in my mind.

Do you want some?\" And then give her the chance to respond. \n\nHowever, just because it would be nice doesn't mean you were obligated to do so. You're not wrong. But your wife isn't wrong to feel a little left out either. \n\nCommunication is the key!", "Instead of fighting taking yourselves grocery shopping, wtf??\n\n\u201cNo food for some reason\u201d like a magic food fairy just appears when you need lunch ideas?

She could be ordering take out with coworkers sometimes but I doubt it. She\u2019s been this way with her lunches at work for so many years I have mostly stopped bringing it up that she should eat more so she\u2019s just not eating dinner every day as an actual meal.

If there\u2019s no more leftovers because we both had it for dinner and didn\u2019t cook, I would just skip lunch and clean the home or just make a sandwich, can of soup, cereal or whatever since there\u2019s not enough time for me to actually cook and eat before my lunch is over.", "I was just going to ask this! \n\nOr when they both worked at different offices and one went out for lunch instead of having packed lunch from home, do they text the other always about takeout for later?", "I usually finish the previous night\u2019s dinner for my lunch break. We have an arrangement where I do the laundry and the cleaning, while she takes care of the cooking and the shopping. Her office is right next to a grocery store, so she will stop in and shop after work on the days she gets out at like 3:30 or 4:30. Because she\u2019s usually the one who cooks, I assumed she knew we were low on food and would\u2019ve bought after work like she usually does. Other times when we needed food and she didn\u2019t go shopping, we would just run out grocery shopping together after work. \n\nThere was bread and some cheese to make a grilled cheese, and some cereal I could\u2019ve made for lunch.

There was food available, but it was like frozen beef and frozen chicken, rice that had to be cooked, etc\u2026 The kind of stuff that could be made in a half hour lunch but I wouldn\u2019t have time to eat.  I\u2019m pretty much doing Inbound Sales over the phone, so it\u2019s not like I can just sneakily take another 10 minutes to eat. The job knows if I\u2019m working. \n\nAnd yes, I was still called inconsiderate after I explained my reasoning. She said \u201cwell it doesn\u2019t matter because I would\u2019ve thought of you and asked if you wanted anything to eat.\u201d Which is a moot point in my opinion because that scenario of her being at home and I\u2019m away for a bit has never existed. If I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m probably at home anyway and when I am gone, I\u2019m either with her anyway or visiting my parents.

Fast food does not keep. Also as someone in the same \"I wfh and my spouse works in office situation\" I would do exactly as OP did and my spouse wouldn't bat an eye bc he isn't oversensitive. He'd be like \"Oh did you order X food for lunch?\" \"yeah\" \"cool\" and that would be the end. If seeing the bag made him crave it he would be like \"i'm gonna get that for lunch tomorrow also\". Communication is key but this isn't a scenario where a reasonable person would expect the courtesy. Mostly because in no world is 5 hour old fast food a courtesy of any kind.

You'd never get work done because \"you aren't really working\".", "Yeah, if she does that for him, this is a different situation.", "Maybe she was just hangry but the fact that you posted means that this argument lasted... it makes no sense unless yall are struggling financially and it was a splurge or something?

She\u2019s usually on top of it and to be honest, she gets annoyed if I inform her on things she was already going to take care of (or ask her to stop by after work.) It makes her think I don\u2019t trust her, so I\u2019ve learned to keep my mouth shut.\n\nClarification: it makes her think I don\u2019t trust her to know that we need stuff or that she won\u2019t do something.", "She works next to a grocery store and usually just stops in there a couple times a week. Most of the time I just have the leftovers from dinner for lunch.
