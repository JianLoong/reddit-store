I don't exactly remember what we were arguing about but she called me a j*rk and I was so angry at the moment that I stopped the car and told her to walk the rest of the way. It was a 30 min walk and in a safe neighborhood so I wasn't worried about her safety. My brother called me and said I'm an asshole and he hasn't been talking to me eversince then.

You\u2019re the asshole \u2728\n\nBtw kids/adults get kidnapped and harmed in safe neighborhoods. She could have been injured by tripping falling or hit by a vehicle.", "Wow! A 10 year old little child hurt your feelings so you got in a huff and made her walk a couple of miles all by herself - something she had never done before. That\u2019s just irresponsible of you - and a little pathetic. YTA.", "YTA no where is safe these days let alone letting a 10 Year old girl walk home. I know ur only 21 but seriously she could have been kidnapped, sex trafficked or hit by a car. Poor kid was probably terrified. You're her uncle she looks up to you. You are yo protect her always even if she hurts ur feelings. Bring her for icecream and apologise for over reacting.", "Call me a snowflake, but making a 10 year old girl walked by herself for 30 minutes is completely unacceptable in this day and age.

There\u2019s no such thing as a safe neighborhood. Be thankful she made it home safely. Your feelings weren\u2019t more important than her safety.", "YTA \n\nAre you serious right now???", "WTF? YTA", "YTA. She\u2019s ten and you\u2019re likely three times her age. There was a way to hold her responsible without putting her in danger. You\u2019ve just modeled to her that she can just remove anyone whose opinion she doesn\u2019t appreciate from her space without a second thought about that individual\u2019s safety instead of addressing the issue and modeling deescalation/communication, not to mention bad things happen to kids in every kind of neighborhood. It\u2019d be one thing if you followed her in the car, or dropped her off down the street and made sure she got home, but you didn\u2019t. You let a child have *so* much power over your emotions that you made a very foolish mistake.\n\nI know these moments are trying, I\u2019m just starting to experience them with my toddler, but the times where we want to lose it with our children are the most crucial times to model the behavior you want to see them perform in these situations. They are especially the times where we need to take a deep breath and understand that these tiny humans are still learning their people and emotional skills and we need age-appropriate expectations. That\u2019s the only way to break these cycles and give them the tools they need to succeed. Telling them to act a certain way and then failing to hold yourself to those expectations only loses you respect as an adult figure.", "YTA\nI\u2019m almost positive you remember the argument and were probably in the wrong hence why they called you a jerk \n\nAlso wth are you doing getting into such a heated argument with a 10 year old that you feel the need to kick them out?\n\nYou aren\u2019t the parent, you don\u2019t get to discipline them in this manner", "YTA, should not be let around children", "YTA Children can get snatched even in 'safe neighborhoods'.

You probably should have just driven her home and told her father you will no longer be driving his disrespectful daughter.

I\u2019m in my mid teens and I get scared if someone walks past ok?", "YTA obviously. \u201csafe neighbourhood\u201d yadayada ure missing the point.

She was in a safe neighborhood. It does seem odd that an elementary school is so far from her home with no bus service. If your brother can afford private school, he's the asshole, he can afford to hire a babysitter or utilize ANY of the options for after school care. He made the kid, not you. She's not your responsibility. You said he's a single dad, is mom dead or does he just have terrible taste in women and you have to pay the price? I'm sure he expects a marching band for doing normal parent stuff. He sounds like an entitled ass and the apple didn't fall far from the tree", "YTA. And your niece was spot on. She's 10.

Extremely rare. Do you know how many?", "Being a good parent has nothing to do with foisting his responsibility onto his family. No good answer why her school is so far away with no bus service.", "My bad, I didn't see it. You know half of these commenters also post the crap about kids are so soft these days, in MY day.....ad nauseam", "?\n\nNo by my logical nothing is inherently safe and should always be approached with a degree of caution until proven otherwise.", "You went back ????    So you left her alone to talk home but drove back around??\n\nYTA", "Look up Amanda Berry and the Ariel Castro kidnappings.", "I notice you only mention checking on her when people suggest this as an option. You\u2019re not convincing anyone. Still AH.", "Imagine losing your shit on a kid who hasn\u2019t even hit puberty yet, leaving them to walk thirty entire minutes alone, for the very first time. \n\nYou are certainly not equipped to be responsible for any kind of child care. Which is what this was. \n\nYou failed to care for the child you were in charge of. Plain and simple. What you did was purposefully endanger the child because you have the emotional maturity of a walnut. \n\nStop getting defensive here. You know you did something terrible. \n\nYTA", "Ok. You went back once. You realize it only takes a couple seconds to snatch a child right? Pull up in a car drag her in and drive off. It dosent matter what she said. You're an adult.

You are responsible for her.", "Take the possible kidnapping/danger to your niece out of it since, at 21, you\u2019re such an expert in neighborhood safety that you\u2019re qualified to make that assessment. \n\nYTA because you got into an argument with a 10 year old and threw a tantrum. You\u2019re not qualified to make adult decisions. You clearly have terrible judgment since you not only did this but continue to defend it in the comments. Grow up. You\u2019re acting like a child and a spoiled child at that.", "But what if something did happen? What if she got kidnapped? That would've been on you 1000000%.
