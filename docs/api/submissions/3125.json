This was and still is a difficult adjustment for some members of my family. \n\nLast year we went on the first family holiday since I was teenager, me, my sister, her partner, nana, mum and him. \nWe went on a 10 day holiday and night 2, we explored & find a bar. We were walking past a cleverly named bar that was clearly run by a queer drag queen but offered entertainment for everyone. \nMum and me were slightly a head of the rest and had a giggle at the name and continued walking. My sister asked why don\u2019t we try in here.\n\nHe eventually saw the place and said he wasn\u2019t going in a place where there\u2019s [drops slur]. I immediatley turned around and demanded to know what he just said. mum was pulling at me telling me to just leave it, it\u2019s fine & not to start anything. \nI looked at my sisters bf & asked him to repeat what mums bf said. More to confirm I did hear what I heard. He repeated it & it took everything in me not to kick off. I walked off in the direction we\u2019d been walking to get distance & calm down. \n\nI stood my ground,I couldn\u2019t look at him when we found the a bar & eventually went back to the villa. \nThere was a massive argument that night when they all got back. He refused to see how he did wrong & still hasn\u2019t apologised to this day. \nIt\u2019s put a massive rift in our family almost a year later but it\u2019s rearing it\u2019s head again as me & my bf are now engaged and have said we dont want him at any of our celebrations for engagement or wedding. \n\nMum has said that this makes it difficult for her, my sister is heartbroken that the family is divided. \nIif we are at birthday or something else we\u2019re all invited to that I will be civil and polite, I wouldn\u2019t ignore him outright but I dont want him in my life & he makes me uncomfortable to be around. I set a boundary 1yr ago for my own health & safety but I\u2019m being told that if they have to accept me for they way I am that I should have to accept him for the way he is, that everyone is entitled to their opinion & that it wasn\u2019t personally about me so I shouldn\u2019t take it personally. In my view he was talking about all queer people which includes me so why wouldn\u2019t i take it personally?\n\nI\u2019acknowledge that everyone is entitled to their opinion but that I can chose to not be around people who\u2019re saying hate speech. \n\nI want to have a relationship with my mum & sister. it\u2019s not impossible for us to do things without him. They\u2019ve told me it\u2019s difficult for them & hurtful to have a divided family but if either of us goes along with what the other wants, one of us will always be unhappy. \n\nI usually just go along with whatever someone else wants to make them happy but I don\u2019t want to compromise my own happiness or mental health anymore. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669290028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3hspn/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_mums_homophobic_bf_to/", "score": 567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
