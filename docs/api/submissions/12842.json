My wife has an older daughter (21F) who is in college and wants to pursue a career in fashion. I have tried to generate stronger bonds between mi new wife and her daughter with Lucy because I think she needs active female figures in her life. Lucy's mom lives travelling around the world because of her work as an humanitarian worker. She is a great mother and person but she is obviously not as present in our daughter's daily life as we all would like.\n\nLucy's relationship with my wife is very good now but she doesn't seem to connect with her stepsister. Last weekend, my daughter was sleeping at a friend's house and my stepdaughter was visiting us. At one point she entered my daughter's room. I am not sure why, she said she wanted to look herself in Lucy's makeup mirror. She saw my daughter's cheerleader uniform that was folded over the chair and asked me if she could use it to take some pictures for instagram. She is very active in social media for her fashion carreer, posting different outfits and looks. \n\nI say yes without doubt, I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like that spcially as it was her stepsister, not a stranger. She posted the pictures and very soon my daughter texted me very mad and said that I shouldn't have let her use it. I honestly don't think I did nothing wrong, I think Lucy is trying to generate conflict because she does not like her stepsister. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679406457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xhec6/aita_for_letting_my_stepdaughter_use_my_daughters/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Others have mentioned that this is your daughter's clothing not yours. A text would have cleared up if she minded.\n\nThe other level is that if this is the uniform for your daughter's school, then they might have issues about the use of their logos, colors and branding. If they do, those concerns will fall on your daughter's participation in cheer.", "YTA. Yes, girls borrow each others stuff.....with permission. \n\nYou do realize your daughter could get in trouble with her  squad, especially if she goes to public school. I dont know how it is everywhere but when I was in high school and my two daughters, the younger of whom is graduating in 2 months...students were not permitted to let other students wear their activities and sports uniforms and arent to wear their uniforms unless it was for school sanctioned activities and events. Letting an ADULT wear her cheerleading uniform for social media clout could land her in hot water.", "YTA Your stepdaughter should never have even been in the daughter's room without her permission. That was her uniform and it wasn't your right to give permission to wear it. Apologize to your daughter and set new rules with stepdaughter about other people's things.", "YTA\n\nThey\u2019re not teenage girls, your daughter is a teen and your step daughter is a full grown adult\n\nWhy would your daughter bother trying to form a bond with her stepsister who:\n\nA) doesn\u2019t live at home\n\nB) who you support more than her\n\nI\u2019ll just add, as a SWer, the only time fully grown women wear cheerleader uniforms is for adult stuff. As a mom, I\u2019d be livid if my daughter\u2019s *school cheer uniform* were defiled for such things. She could\u2019ve easily gotten something off Amazon if she wanted to roleplay as a cheerleader instead\n\nEdit: clarification and formatting", ">I say yes without doubt, I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like that spcially as it was her stepsister, not a stranger.\n\nThere is one key thing that is missing here but is usually the reason teenage girls don't mind sharing clothes with friends/family - consent.  As in getting consent from the owner of the clothing before giving permission. Your stepdaughter knew she wouldn't get permission from the owner which is why she asked you instead of Lucy. And instead of being the adult and protecting your daughter's belongings,  you gave permission that wasn't yours to give. \n\nI also wonder why you let your stepdaughter into your daughter's room without her there in the first place. Or why you don't have an issue with a 21 year old trying on a 16 year olds cheerleading outfit since they are probably not the same size. Her taking pictures of herself in a teenager's cheerleading outfit to put on Instagram as \"fashion\" is bizarre.  That kind of school girl outfit on an adult is more fetish than fashion. \n\nYTA", "Yes YTA\n\nThose are her personal belongings. You had absolutely no right to give someone else permission to use her things.", "Are you sure you are the parent of a teenager? Heck, are you sure you are an adult?\n\nI'm pretty sure everyone knows that step one is asking permission. Stepdaughter asked if she could wear **Lucy**'s clothing. So the person that should have been asked was Lucy. You should have said- let me call her and ask since Lucy wasn't there.\n\nLucy may have been fine with it or not. But we'll never know cuz you didn't do that.\n\n(All of which ignores that cheerleading uniforms don't typically belong to a person individually and are generally on loan from the school or organization so there is added responsibility if something happens to it- like it gets damaged.)\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYou made an assumption and oh buddy was it the wrong one. \n\nThe two things the majority of teenagers hate more than anything, is -\n\n1. When their parent tries to force their new family down their throat, and \n2. When their things are moved, taken, or borrowed without their permission\n\nGood job on doing both of them. And even outside of her just being a teen and your daughter, you didn\u2019t have the right to allow your stepdaughter to use Lucy\u2019s things. That\u2019s just basic human decency.", "YTA \n\n> I say yes without doubt\n\nYour answer should have been \"Ask your stepsister.\" Your daughter is 16 and damn near an adult. You shouldn't be giving other people permission to go rummaging around in her stuff for Instagram likes.\n\nAlso real shocker that these two don't get along if this is how you and her stepsister act.", "HUGE YTA. You shouldn't have even allowed her in your daughter's room!", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your outfit to give permission to use/wear, it\u2019s your daughters.\n\nAlso, never assume people like to share clothes. Your daughter earned that cheerleader outfit and stepdaughter, who isn\u2019t a teenager, used it for social media, for likes and followers.", "YTA - not yours, not yours to lend out. Some schools also have strict rules about uniforms, your daughter was using your step daughters uniform as a costume. Do you not see how that\u2019s rude?\n\nYour lack of respect for your stepdaughter is gross. You only seem to care about your daughter and how she gets along with your new wife.", "YTA. You have no right to give anyone permission to use anything that doesn\u2019t belong to you. Also, nobody who isn\u2019t Lucy should be in her room without her knowledge and permission.", "Not your uniform, not your decision. YTA.", "YTA you let someone else use your daughter's things without her permission. You should have never agreed to let her into your daughter's room, that was an invasion of your daughter's privacy.", "YTA. It\u2019s pretty simple, you don\u2019t have the right to lend someone else\u2019s belongings without their permission, which you did not have. You wouldn\u2019t want anyone lending out your belongings without your permission, and the same courtesy should be extended to your daughter. The relationship between the two daughters has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s about respect, and you had none. The 21 year old shouldn\u2019t even have been in her sisters room to begin with, she didn\u2019t have permission from the person who\u2019s space she invaded.", "YTA: you should have told your step-daughter to ask your daughter directly.\n\nIf your daughter already does not have a good relationship with her step-sister this just made it worse. Oftentimes children feel jealousy towards the children of their parents' new partners, due to some subconscious fear of being replaced. If that was the case for Lucy, your actions reinforced those fears.\n\nBoth you and your step-daughter also demonstrated that you do not respect Lucy's space and privacy. There was no need for either of you to be in her room while she was not there. If you do not learn and respect your daughter's boundaries, you'll just mess up all of the relationships you actually wish to grow.\n\nIn short: talk to each other!!", "YTA. Dad you don't loan your daughters clothes. What's really bad is you say she doesn't like her stepsister. But damage to your relationship with your daughter a good possibility. Find another way to bond with your stepdaughter.", "Yta, never assume things..those are your daughter's and could have sentimental value. Not only that but like it's her stuff.

Sharing clothing and personal property is negotiated between two people. This was not that.\n\nIf Lucy didn't like your SD before she SURE AS F isn't going to like her now. Although the stepdaughter, unless she is as EQ deficient as you, knew when she asked that what she asked was over the line and not okay.

It literally makes no logical sense to know that someone dislikes someone else and invite the person they dislike to do something as intimate as wearing their clothes.", "YTA dude you never let anyone touch your daughters stuff unless she gives you the ok. This is why most females stick to living with mom, they get it. Dads don\u2019t think about it the way we do.", "YTA\n\nThe stepdaughter should NOT have been allowed in your daughter's room. \n\nYour daughter should have been ASKED about lending the uniform. If she refused, no lending, period. \n\nAny pictures the stepdaughter made with that uniform should be DELETED immediately. \n\nIt should be made clear to the stepdaughter - by you - that she may NOT go into your daughter's room or touch her belongings without her permission.\n\nLucy has every right to be furious at both of you.", "Unless you\u2019re actually a cheerleader, I\u2019ve never seen someone wear a cheerleading outfit outside of sexy times.

YTA.", "YTA, even if you didn't realize it. From my high school experience, teenage girls were very particular about their possessions, especially someone snooping around in their stuff, even if it was a stepsister. You should have asked 21F to leave 16F's room, and tell her to ask her stepsister if she could wear the uniform. Even as their father, you didn't have the right to allow 21F to wear 16F's clothes without permission.", "YTA.\nYou are allowing stepdaughter to disrespect Lucy. \nWhy did stepdaughter feel that she could go into Lucy's room without permission?? What does a 21 year old need to be doing in a 16 year olds room?\n\nLucy has a mind of her own, stop trying to force relationships on her that she clearly doesn't want. You seem to hold your stepdaughter in higher regard than your own daughter. You're slowly destroying your own relationship with Lucy.", "YTA. I doubt your stepdaughter really wanted to look in your daughter's mirror. (Are there no mirrors in the bathroom?) Stepdaughter wanted to snoop through daughter's things and see if there was anything she could use. If I were your daughter, I would feel disrespected in many ways, and I would probably never feel comfortable around the stepdaughter.", "YTA - your wanting to score points with your stepdaughter has cost you more than you realize with your daughter. You are blaming your daughter for wanting to start conflict; but it was actually the stepdaughter that started it and then rubbed your daughter\u2019s face in it.", "YTA, although older daughter ain't a saint in this scenario either.\n\nYou lent out something that didn't belong to you, always assholish.  You enabled your SD to snoop (seriously, \"I have to look in only this one particular mirror\" is not the convincing line you think it is).  Sisters, step- or bio-, do NOT always want to share their things with one another... and this is a much-older step sibling of extremely short vintage.\n\nIt's very easy to see why Lucy hasn't bonded with her stepsister.  Now you've made it worse.", "YTA.

Not yours to lend out.", " YTA\n\nYour stepdaughter clearly doesn't respect your daughter's boundaries, and you're only encouraging it.\n\nNot only should you have refused permission for her to wear the outfit, you should have stood up for your daughter.

And told her that if she wishes to borrow your daughter's clothes, she needs to ask your daughter, and respect the daughter's answer if it is \"no.\"\n\nYou married your new wife, and got a stepdaughter in the process.  Your daughter did not have a choice about the matter.  She got two housemates not of her choosing. \n\nWhy on earth would you think that your daughter would be happy to share her private possessions with someone you know she doesn't like?  Someone who doesn't even have enough respect for your daughter to ask your daughter's permission both for entering you daughter's room, and borrowing your daughter's clothes?\n\nIf anyone was stirring the pot and trying to cause trouble, it was your stepdaughter, by ignoring your daughter's privacy and boundaries.  And by using you as a way to justify ignoring your daughter's privacy and boundaries - I'm sure she knew that your daughter would not be willing to let her in her room or loan her the clothes, and your stepdaughter asked you in order to have your \"yes\" override the \"no\" she knew she'd get from your daughter. \n\nPlus, your daughter is a minor.  You need to protect your daughter's boundaries and limits from her adult stepsister.  Your stepdaughter has her mother as her advocate in the household, it is your responsibility to advocate for and protect your daughter in a situation that is awkward, uncomfortable, and not of her choosing. \n\nIf your stepdaughter is just walking into your daughter's room without permission whenever she feels like it, you need to get that behavior under control.

My wife has an older daughter (21F) who is in college and wants to pursue a career in fashion. I have tried to generate stronger bonds between mi new wife and her daughter with Lucy because I think she needs active female figures in her life. Lucy's mom lives travelling around the world because of her work as an humanitarian worker. She is a great mother and person but she is obviously not as present in our daughter's daily life as we all would like.\n\nLucy's relationship with my wife is very good now but she doesn't seem to connect with her stepsister. Last weekend, my daughter was sleeping at a friend's house and my stepdaughter was visiting us. At one point she entered my daughter's room. I am not sure why, she said she wanted to look herself in Lucy's makeup mirror. She saw my daughter's cheerleader uniform that was folded over the chair and asked me if she could use it to take some pictures for instagram. She is very active in social media for her fashion carreer, posting different outfits and looks. \n\nI say yes without doubt, I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like that spcially as it was her stepsister, not a stranger. She posted the pictures and very soon my daughter texted me very mad and said that I shouldn't have let her use it. I honestly don't think I did nothing wrong, I think Lucy is trying to generate conflict because she does not like her stepsister. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know porn and Hollywood movies make it sound like girls are always having sleepovers, doing each other's nails and sharing clothes, but real life doesn't always work that way. Your daughter's clothes are your daughter's clothes. She should always be asked for permission to borrow her belongings, and she has the right to say no. \n\nAlso? This isn't even your daughter's personal clothing; it's a sports uniform that your daughter wears to *represent* the school/club.

She has a right to say no to anyone borrowing her stuff. **You** generated conflict by treating your daughter like she was second class in her own home, and like her opinion on sharing her own belongings doesn't matter. \n\nAlso, your stepdaughter generated conflict when she went into your daughter's room without permission:\n\n>At one point she entered my daughter's room.

Lucy's makeup mirror isn't a magic item that's substantially different from her own or her mom's makeup mirrors, or even a bathroom mirror. She didn't need to be in there.

I did gymnastics so for sanitary purposes we purchased our leotards and kept them but for football/cheer/soccer etc. they \u201cborrowed\u201d their uniforms from the athletic program. So if a cheerleader let her sister wear the uniform and the sister went and posted a picture and the school happened to see it the student could get in trouble or be fined (required to pay for the uniform). \n\nIt also depends on the type of picture, another commenter pointed out that the stepsister may have been taking more \u201csuggestive pictures\u201d. A girl was kicked off of our cheer team for twerking in her uniform and posting it because the school claimed that she was representing the school while in uniform and she was behaving in an \u201cinappropriate manner\u201d. So OP\u2019s daughter could also be in trouble if the pictures were deemed \u201csuggestive\u201d by the school. \n\nEdit to add: I know every school is different so this might not be the case here but I still think OP is the AH.", "Because a uniform is identifiable to the school or organisation, so any use of it is linked to that school or organisation. So it needs to be regulated.", "It's not the step daughter's property. She is borrowing it from the school and representing the school when wearing it.\n\nA high school athlete wearing school athletic gear is appropriate. She will have clear guidance on what she may and may not do while wearing the uniform. This will include makeup and hair styles and shoes. \n\nAn adult wearing high school gear in potentially sexy poses or with heavy makeup is not okay at all. Her use of the uniform is not sanctioned by the school.", "As others have pointed out, athletic and activities uniforms (sports, marching band, cheer and dance, color guard, winter guard etc) often don't actually belong to the student. They are returned at the end of the year. \n\nAside from that, when in these uniforms, which are usually pretty conspicuously identifiable to Individual schools, students are representing their school and their organization. Their conduct while in uniform is taken VERY seriously. That is why the uniform is not supposed to be worn unless it is specifically sanctioned by the school. Meaning not putting it on to go to the mall, for example. \n\nAn ADULT wearing a students uniform is not only misrepresenting the cheer squad but also could be seen as impersonating a student and if these photos were in any way suggestive, it's out of the schools hand. High school athletics are governed by the state high school athletic association. The entire squad could face consequences. \n\nThis is more serious than an adult wanting to play dress up.", "A grown woman isn't wearing a high school cheerleaders outfit in an innocent way. It's basically soft core porn. The daughter could get in trouble because she's supposed to be responsible for her uniform and it that uniform represents her school and/or squad. It's bad light", "Fetishizing underage girls is very fashionable. And also liable to get her kicked off the team/suspended if they deem that she lent it out to her sister.", "Right?! Sounds like a calculated move on the 21y/o\u2019s part. Adults should know that thirds parties CANT lend out someone else\u2019s stuff. The fact she even asked the dad is weird to me. \nAnd OP as an adult should have obviously known that he can\u2019t lend out his daughter\u2019s stuff. If he really didn\u2019t think she\u2019d mind, he could have told SD: \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll mind but why don\u2019t you shoot her a message to ask her?\u201d\nThey both played dumb for whatever reason.", "And this make me question op motif.. You know letting 21year old stepdaughter wearing his 16th yrs old CHEARLEADER uniform.. Whatever his fantasy is...", "I think it depends on the school. Some schools don\u2019t have enough money to continuously buy cheerleading uniforms, and I guess maybe some do.", "As said elsewhere, it depends on the school.  But it is VERY common in U.S. public schools for this to be the case.  So common that the student owning it would be an exception.  Its the same for things like choir and band outfits.  When I was in high school I was in choir, I also played piano and was going to accompany some of my band friends for a school event.  Since I didn't have a band uniform I asked if I could wear my choir one.  Both the choir and band directors and I think someone else had to sign off on me wearing the choral uniform for a non-choral event.  Also, because that uniform room would not be unlocked for the event I think I had to store the uniform in the band director's office temporarily.", "Even if OP's daughter owns the actual outfit, the colors/logo belong to the school and she could face consequences if the outfit is misused like say her adult stepsister posting what were possibly sexual/fetish pictures in a high school cheerleading outfit possibly taken in the high schooler's room.", "There's also typically an honor code for wearing any type of sports or band uniform. Or letter jacket. (In the US you get a letter when you reach Junior Varsity or Varsity level.) So you can get kicked off the team or out of the band if you post inappropriate pics of yourself in your uniform or letter jacket. Or if you lend it out. \n\nThis is super important in the US because unless your parents are rich, that's probably your only chance of going to college with a scholarship. \n\nYes. You can tell what high school you go to by your uniform or your letter jacket. (Yes. They literally award you a big letter. You are either gifted or must purchase the jacket. You sew the letter on.)", "what I quoted just reeks of being intentionally obtuse", "I assumed the same but didn\u2019t want to jump on that.", "Fucking foul ISNT it. Nothing worse than morally bankrupt parents who put others in front of their own kids", "Oh cool, I didn't know they had to give them back. Sitcoms have lied to me.", "Agree, if you remember that movie call Fab Five about those cheerleader. I think after that story was everywhere they up thw rules", "Haha, It\u2019s actually a really good system for students who may not be able to afford the uniforms but it has its cons", "This varies from school to school for cheer. Some schools lend cheer uniforms; some require the cheerleader to buy them.", "Band does this too!! We had to sell my clarinet when I was in middle school, in highschool I was loaned a clarinet that I could either buy when I graduated or just give back!", "This! Two of our granddaughters made the squad and they had to work extremely hard to pay for their uniforms and camps etc besides the $1500 (each) paid by their families! Their uniforms were over 1/3 of what they had to raise. One granddaughter had a sleepover and her spanky pants came up missing-she got demerits, and had to buy a new pair. \n\nYTA Dad! This is not how you get girls to bond!", "I mean it makes so much sense now you've said it! My school didn't really have any programs like that (and cheerleading isn't really a big think in the UK, at least not when I was in high school) but yeah, I always just assumed everything was owned by the students", "Oh god this reminded me how expensive marching band uniforms were, they didn\u2019t even let us take those home and stored them in a dedicated room"]}
