My wife has an older daughter (21F) who is in college and wants to pursue a career in fashion. I have tried to generate stronger bonds between mi new wife and her daughter with Lucy because I think she needs active female figures in her life. Lucy's mom lives travelling around the world because of her work as an humanitarian worker. She is a great mother and person but she is obviously not as present in our daughter's daily life as we all would like.\n\nLucy's relationship with my wife is very good now but she doesn't seem to connect with her stepsister. Last weekend, my daughter was sleeping at a friend's house and my stepdaughter was visiting us. At one point she entered my daughter's room. I am not sure why, she said she wanted to look herself in Lucy's makeup mirror. She saw my daughter's cheerleader uniform that was folded over the chair and asked me if she could use it to take some pictures for instagram. She is very active in social media for her fashion carreer, posting different outfits and looks. \n\nI say yes without doubt, I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like that spcially as it was her stepsister, not a stranger. She posted the pictures and very soon my daughter texted me very mad and said that I shouldn't have let her use it. I honestly don't think I did nothing wrong, I think Lucy is trying to generate conflict because she does not like her stepsister. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679406457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xhec6/aita_for_letting_my_stepdaughter_use_my_daughters/", "score": 603, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Others have mentioned that this is your daughter's clothing not yours. A text would have cleared up if she minded.\n\nThe other level is that if this is the uniform for your daughter's school, then they might have issues about the use of their logos, colors and branding. If they do, those concerns will fall on your daughter's participation in cheer.", "YTA. Yes, girls borrow each others stuff.....with permission. \n\nYou do realize your daughter could get in trouble with her  squad, especially if she goes to public school. I dont know how it is everywhere but when I was in high school and my two daughters, the younger of whom is graduating in 2 months...students were not permitted to let other students wear their activities and sports uniforms and arent to wear their uniforms unless it was for school sanctioned activities and events. Letting an ADULT wear her cheerleading uniform for social media clout could land her in hot water.", "YTA Your stepdaughter should never have even been in the daughter's room without her permission. That was her uniform and it wasn't your right to give permission to wear it. Apologize to your daughter and set new rules with stepdaughter about other people's things.", "YTA\n\nThey\u2019re not teenage girls, your daughter is a teen and your step daughter is a full grown adult\n\nWhy would your daughter bother trying to form a bond with her stepsister who:\n\nA) doesn\u2019t live at home\n\nB) who you support more than her\n\nI\u2019ll just add, as a SWer, the only time fully grown women wear cheerleader uniforms is for adult stuff. As a mom, I\u2019d be livid if my daughter\u2019s *school cheer uniform* were defiled for such things. She could\u2019ve easily gotten something off Amazon if she wanted to roleplay as a cheerleader instead\n\nEdit: clarification and formatting", ">I say yes without doubt, I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like that spcially as it was her stepsister, not a stranger.\n\nThere is one key thing that is missing here but is usually the reason teenage girls don't mind sharing clothes with friends/family - consent.  As in getting consent from the owner of the clothing before giving permission. Your stepdaughter knew she wouldn't get permission from the owner which is why she asked you instead of Lucy. And instead of being the adult and protecting your daughter's belongings,  you gave permission that wasn't yours to give. \n\nI also wonder why you let your stepdaughter into your daughter's room without her there in the first place. Or why you don't have an issue with a 21 year old trying on a 16 year olds cheerleading outfit since they are probably not the same size. Her taking pictures of herself in a teenager's cheerleading outfit to put on Instagram as \"fashion\" is bizarre.  That kind of school girl outfit on an adult is more fetish than fashion. \n\nYTA", "Yes YTA\n\nThose are her personal belongings. You had absolutely no right to give someone else permission to use her things.", "Are you sure you are the parent of a teenager? Heck, are you sure you are an adult?\n\nI'm pretty sure everyone knows that step one is asking permission. Stepdaughter asked if she could wear **Lucy**'s clothing. So the person that should have been asked was Lucy. You should have said- let me call her and ask since Lucy wasn't there.\n\nLucy may have been fine with it or not. But we'll never know cuz you didn't do that.\n\n(All of which ignores that cheerleading uniforms don't typically belong to a person individually and are generally on loan from the school or organization so there is added responsibility if something happens to it- like it gets damaged.)\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYou made an assumption and oh buddy was it the wrong one. \n\nThe two things the majority of teenagers hate more than anything, is -\n\n1. When their parent tries to force their new family down their throat, and \n2. When their things are moved, taken, or borrowed without their permission\n\nGood job on doing both of them. And even outside of her just being a teen and your daughter, you didn\u2019t have the right to allow your stepdaughter to use Lucy\u2019s things. That\u2019s just basic human decency.", "YTA \n\n> I say yes without doubt\n\nYour answer should have been \"Ask your stepsister.\" Your daughter is 16 and damn near an adult. You shouldn't be giving other people permission to go rummaging around in her stuff for Instagram likes.\n\nAlso real shocker that these two don't get along if this is how you and her stepsister act.", "HUGE YTA. You shouldn't have even allowed her in your daughter's room!", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your outfit to give permission to use/wear, it\u2019s your daughters.\n\nAlso, never assume people like to share clothes. Your daughter earned that cheerleader outfit and stepdaughter, who isn\u2019t a teenager, used it for social media, for likes and followers.", "YTA - not yours, not yours to lend out. Some schools also have strict rules about uniforms, your daughter was using your step daughters uniform as a costume. Do you not see how that\u2019s rude?\n\nYour lack of respect for your stepdaughter is gross. You only seem to care about your daughter and how she gets along with your new wife.", "YTA. You have no right to give anyone permission to use anything that doesn\u2019t belong to you. Also, nobody who isn\u2019t Lucy should be in her room without her knowledge and permission.", "Not your uniform, not your decision. YTA.", "YTA you let someone else use your daughter's things without her permission. You should have never agreed to let her into your daughter's room, that was an invasion of your daughter's privacy.", "YTA. It\u2019s pretty simple, you don\u2019t have the right to lend someone else\u2019s belongings without their permission, which you did not have. You wouldn\u2019t want anyone lending out your belongings without your permission, and the same courtesy should be extended to your daughter. The relationship between the two daughters has nothing to do with it. It\u2019s about respect, and you had none. The 21 year old shouldn\u2019t even have been in her sisters room to begin with, she didn\u2019t have permission from the person who\u2019s space she invaded.", "YTA: you should have told your step-daughter to ask your daughter directly.\n\nIf your daughter already does not have a good relationship with her step-sister this just made it worse. Oftentimes children feel jealousy towards the children of their parents' new partners, due to some subconscious fear of being replaced. If that was the case for Lucy, your actions reinforced those fears.\n\nBoth you and your step-daughter also demonstrated that you do not respect Lucy's space and privacy. There was no need for either of you to be in her room while she was not there. If you do not learn and respect your daughter's boundaries, you'll just mess up all of the relationships you actually wish to grow.\n\nIn short: talk to each other!!", "YTA. Dad you don't loan your daughters clothes. What's really bad is you say she doesn't like her stepsister. But damage to your relationship with your daughter a good possibility. Find another way to bond with your stepdaughter.", "Yta, never assume things..those are your daughter's and could have sentimental value. Not only that but like it's her stuff.

Sharing clothing and personal property is negotiated between two people. This was not that.\n\nIf Lucy didn't like your SD before she SURE AS F isn't going to like her now. Although the stepdaughter, unless she is as EQ deficient as you, knew when she asked that what she asked was over the line and not okay.

It literally makes no logical sense to know that someone dislikes someone else and invite the person they dislike to do something as intimate as wearing their clothes.", "YTA dude you never let anyone touch your daughters stuff unless she gives you the ok. This is why most females stick to living with mom, they get it. Dads don\u2019t think about it the way we do.", "YTA\n\nThe stepdaughter should NOT have been allowed in your daughter's room. \n\nYour daughter should have been ASKED about lending the uniform. If she refused, no lending, period. \n\nAny pictures the stepdaughter made with that uniform should be DELETED immediately. \n\nIt should be made clear to the stepdaughter - by you - that she may NOT go into your daughter's room or touch her belongings without her permission.\n\nLucy has every right to be furious at both of you.", "Unless you\u2019re actually a cheerleader, I\u2019ve never seen someone wear a cheerleading outfit outside of sexy times. Nice of you to allow your adult step-daughter to sexualise your daughters school uniform and post it in the internet. Doesn\u2019t that gross you out? Maybe she can borrow her underwear next too. YTA.", "YTA, even if you didn't realize it. From my high school experience, teenage girls were very particular about their possessions, especially someone snooping around in their stuff, even if it was a stepsister. You should have asked 21F to leave 16F's room, and tell her to ask her stepsister if she could wear the uniform. Even as their father, you didn't have the right to allow 21F to wear 16F's clothes without permission.", "YTA.\nYou are allowing stepdaughter to disrespect Lucy. \nWhy did stepdaughter feel that she could go into Lucy's room without permission?? What does a 21 year old need to be doing in a 16 year olds room?\n\nLucy has a mind of her own, stop trying to force relationships on her that she clearly doesn't want. You seem to hold your stepdaughter in higher regard than your own daughter. You're slowly destroying your own relationship with Lucy.", "YTA. I doubt your stepdaughter really wanted to look in your daughter's mirror. (Are there no mirrors in the bathroom?) Stepdaughter wanted to snoop through daughter's things and see if there was anything she could use. If I were your daughter, I would feel disrespected in many ways, and I would probably never feel comfortable around the stepdaughter.", "YTA - your wanting to score points with your stepdaughter has cost you more than you realize with your daughter. You are blaming your daughter for wanting to start conflict; but it was actually the stepdaughter that started it and then rubbed your daughter\u2019s face in it.", "YTA, although older daughter ain't a saint in this scenario either.\n\nYou lent out something that didn't belong to you, always assholish.  You enabled your SD to snoop (seriously, \"I have to look in only this one particular mirror\" is not the convincing line you think it is).  Sisters, step- or bio-, do NOT always want to share their things with one another... and this is a much-older step sibling of extremely short vintage.\n\nIt's very easy to see why Lucy hasn't bonded with her stepsister.  Now you've made it worse.", "YTA.

Not yours to lend out.", " YTA\n\nYour stepdaughter clearly doesn't respect your daughter's boundaries, and you're only encouraging it.\n\nNot only should you have refused permission for her to wear the outfit, you should have stood up for your daughter.

And told her that if she wishes to borrow your daughter's clothes, she needs to ask your daughter, and respect the daughter's answer if it is \"no.\"\n\nYou married your new wife, and got a stepdaughter in the process.  Your daughter did not have a choice about the matter.  She got two housemates not of her choosing. \n\nWhy on earth would you think that your daughter would be happy to share her private possessions with someone you know she doesn't like?  Someone who doesn't even have enough respect for your daughter to ask your daughter's permission both for entering you daughter's room, and borrowing your daughter's clothes?\n\nIf anyone was stirring the pot and trying to cause trouble, it was your stepdaughter, by ignoring your daughter's privacy and boundaries.  And by using you as a way to justify ignoring your daughter's privacy and boundaries - I'm sure she knew that your daughter would not be willing to let her in her room or loan her the clothes, and your stepdaughter asked you in order to have your \"yes\" override the \"no\" she knew she'd get from your daughter. \n\nPlus, your daughter is a minor.  You need to protect your daughter's boundaries and limits from her adult stepsister.  Your stepdaughter has her mother as her advocate in the household, it is your responsibility to advocate for and protect your daughter in a situation that is awkward, uncomfortable, and not of her choosing. \n\nIf your stepdaughter is just walking into your daughter's room without permission whenever she feels like it, you need to get that behavior under control.

My wife has an older daughter (21F) who is in college and wants to pursue a career in fashion. I have tried to generate stronger bonds between mi new wife and her daughter with Lucy because I think she needs active female figures in her life. Lucy's mom lives travelling around the world because of her work as an humanitarian worker. She is a great mother and person but she is obviously not as present in our daughter's daily life as we all would like.\n\nLucy's relationship with my wife is very good now but she doesn't seem to connect with her stepsister. Last weekend, my daughter was sleeping at a friend's house and my stepdaughter was visiting us. At one point she entered my daughter's room. I am not sure why, she said she wanted to look herself in Lucy's makeup mirror. She saw my daughter's cheerleader uniform that was folded over the chair and asked me if she could use it to take some pictures for instagram. She is very active in social media for her fashion carreer, posting different outfits and looks. \n\nI say yes without doubt, I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like that spcially as it was her stepsister, not a stranger. She posted the pictures and very soon my daughter texted me very mad and said that I shouldn't have let her use it. I honestly don't think I did nothing wrong, I think Lucy is trying to generate conflict because she does not like her stepsister. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know porn and Hollywood movies make it sound like girls are always having sleepovers, doing each other's nails and sharing clothes, but real life doesn't always work that way. Your daughter's clothes are your daughter's clothes. She should always be asked for permission to borrow her belongings, and she has the right to say no. \n\nAlso? This isn't even your daughter's personal clothing; it's a sports uniform that your daughter wears to *represent* the school/club.

She has a right to say no to anyone borrowing her stuff. **You** generated conflict by treating your daughter like she was second class in her own home, and like her opinion on sharing her own belongings doesn't matter. \n\nAlso, your stepdaughter generated conflict when she went into your daughter's room without permission:\n\n>At one point she entered my daughter's room.

Lucy's makeup mirror isn't a magic item that's substantially different from her own or her mom's makeup mirrors, or even a bathroom mirror. She didn't need to be in there.

Allowing your step daughter in was witching that authority, but wasn\u2019t in good faith.

Who gives you the right to give permission for others clothes to be worn????", "I do, I\u2019ve seen pro football games and college cheerleading. I\u2019m sure they would just wear their uniform than asking their stepdad if they can squeeze into their teen stepsisters :)\n\nBut please, continue to \u201ceducate\u201d me LOL", "I\u2019m not trying to educate you. You said \u201cthe only time fully grown women wear cheerleader uniforms is for adult stuff\u201d", "Yes! We could get kicked off the team for letting someone wear our uniforms. It was a big deal. This is not okay.", "I actually thought that, too.", "It's gross that a 21 yo woman wearing a 16 yo's uniform (something that's not super stretchy) I'd be surprised if she didn't damaged it somehow.", "I'll tell you what colleges don't have- high school names on their cheerleaders' uniforms", "Right? I think I even had to sign something? Like it was expulsion worthy. The school wouldn\u2019t care if it was the parent or daughter that lent it, they\u2019d just boot them to avoid controversy.", "The school and/or mascot will be prominent on the uniform, most likely. Also, it\u2019s been awhile since I was in high school but at that time, my school made cheerleaders sign a kind of \u201cmoral code\u201d statement that they would not wear their uniform while doing anything not school related and it included not lending it to anyone. No idea how common that is though.", "\u2026It\u2019s a school uniform. Have you only seen porn cheer outfits, in that you forgot high school \u2018s actually label them?", "I truly hope that the stepsister posted on insta or TikTok or something similar, even if she also posted it elsewhere. I was figuring Lucy knew she'd worn the uniform because she saw a pic of stepsister in it online.", "Oh yeah, lots of content creators have a main page and then an \"other\" page. My guess is she posted a vanilla one to the main. Funny enough the photoshop groups are why I know this. A lot of the girls will ask for edits to make more \"fun\" pics general media friendly.", "See how it works when OP is not home and step asks his daughter if she thinks he would mind if she used his car.", "YTA - that's a complete invasion of personal space and privacy. If someone you barely had a relationship with went into your room without permission and started using your things you would probably also be upset.", "YTA for several reasons.\n\n1. WTF do you mean by she needs active women in her life??  Does she not have any friends, teachers other relatives?  Also regardless of the fact her mum travels she is still present in her life AND its not for you to determine if this is enough for your daughter.\n2. Your daughters room should be private!!  Stepdaughter should not be just waltzing in there when she feels like it especially Lucy is not there.\n3. You had NO RIGHT to lend out any of Lucy\u2019s possessions.  And you are wrong about all teenage girls sharing clothes.  Some may share clothes among FRIENDS but being her older stepsister does not give her a free pass to Lucy\u2019s personal possessions.\n4. Its somewhat interesting the the stepdaughter didn\u2019t ask Lucy directly - that should give you an insight into their relationship on BOTH SIDES.\n5. Lucy is not trying to create conflict because she doesn't like her stepsister.  She is rightly angry that both you and her stepsister overstepped in allowing stepdaughter to enter Lucy\u2019s bedroom without permission and in decided to lend out Lucy\u2019s processions.\n\nI think you can probably kiss goodbye to any thought you have about your daughter and stepdaughter being any kind of friends AND its about time you started advocating for your daughter instead of putting the blame on her when stepdaughter (and you) are clearly in the wrong.", "You basically told your daughter \"I don't care about your personal privacy, you aren't entitled to personal belongings, and your sisters picture is more important than you being on the cheer team\" \nYes yta. Yta yta yta.", "Yta", "YTA in case you have not figured it out.  Your step daughter just established dominance and you are like, cool.  Lucy doesn't owe you a relationship with her stepsister just because it would make life easier for you.  You have really let Lucy down.", "YTA albeit you probably had good intentions.  Your stepdaughter on the other hand really is the main A here.  Your daughter has every right to be annoyed and her bedroom is her personal space.  Your stepdaughter had no right just going in there.", "YTA. That's a pretty personal thing to lend out without permission. Also, I think your daughter is entitled to some privacy. Your step daughter shouldn't have been in your daughter's room. \n\nJust make it clear to your step daughter that your daughter is now free to go into HER room and use HER stuff. Even steven.", "YTA, without a doubt. Your stepdaughter is also TAH. I bet you just helped SD ruin every relationship in the house.", "YTA.  First of all 21 is not a teenager, she\u2019s a grown woman.  Secondly, she entered your daughter\u2019s private space without permission to rummage through your daughter\u2019s things, and you let her wear your child\u2019s cheerleader uniform?!

Sure.", "YTA - 1/you let yourself be manipulated. 2/Your step daughter is 21 and old enough to know she shouldn't have asked you for permission. She should have asked your daughter's permission. 3/Never give step daughter permission to use your daughter's \"stuff\".

Second, she had no right to go into your daughters room.  You had no right to give permission for her to wear your daughters uniform", ">I assume teenage girls don't mind using each others clothes and things like\n\nWhy do men keep assuming this? Like sir, what the heck would you know about the teenage girl experience?\n\nYTA. \n\nYou overstepped and tried to force a bond instead of letting your daughter's relationship with her stepsister (who is NOT a teenager) evolve organically and now, you've basically pushed the opportunity of that bond forging off the emotional table all together. And why not respect Lucy's feelings about her young adult step-sister and accept that the age difference is naturally going to present a hurdle or two? Stop trying to control her feelings and force the outcome *you* want. Accept there are things you cannot control.", "YTA. You never lend out your daughters things without her permission. \n\nAlso, why does an adult want to put on a teenagers cheerleading uniform for insta?????? Use your head.", "Why would you give her permission to do that? Did you look at the pictures? Makes you sound creepy. She\u2019s an adult wanting to wear your teenage daughter cheer uniform. Inappropriate. Use your brain. YTA", "yta and by the way this has been posted before.", "YTA", "Dudes oblivious. No all  girls do not share clothes. And your 21 year old daughter posed in your 17 year old MINOR daughters cheer uniform to be sexually provocative on the internet. Its disgusting and a huge violation. He needs to like use his goddammn brain.", "Well, the fact it's the local highschool's cheerleading uniform with their logo/mascot and colors would be a big give away.", "a) logos. b) you seem to be forgetting that high schoolers are roughly the size of other adults.", "When Lucy starts dating (if she\u2019s not already) can she let people go look in your room and try on your clothes because she wants you to be close with her potential partner?

It seems as if you want your stepdaughter to like you but you can\u2019t let her invade your daughter\u2019s privacy to do it. Girls who know and like each other share clothes.

Why would you daughter want to come home?", "YTA.  That uniform was Lucy's (and ONLY hers) to lend.  Would you like someone other than you to lend out your shit to someone else?  P. S.

It is not your uniform to lend, it belongs to Lucy. Only Lucy can say who she lends it too.", "NTA. Your house your rules.", "YTA.\n\nYour stepdaughter was in your daughter's room looking for outfits to borrow to make her look like a teenager. That's gross and so is your stepdaughter.\n\nYou owe your daughter many apologies. Promises and a lock to keep stepdaughter out of her room.

How would you feel if someone was giving permission from people to use your property without asking you? Keep pushing for her to bond with your stepdaughter, and you could very well damage your relationship with her.

Tell me you are narrow minded and probably a misogynist without telling me you are narrow minded and probably a misogynist. Teenage girls like sharing clothes.....please get a grip on reality.

What a betrayal!", "Yeah, this could actually get her in trouble with her team/school.", "my high school cheer team had strict rules that no one could post wearing your uniform (like borrow it for Halloween or something), the uniform represents the whole organization.

The uniform was not yours to lend. Not only that, Lucy worked hard to earn the right to wear it.", "YTA - are you kidding me? It's a COMPLETE lack of respect and privacy. How dare you actually give permission for your stepdaughter to use something that isn't even yours?

I wanted to buy a new purse\" and your daughter says \"Yes of course! He was probably going to spend it on you anyways!\" That's essentially what you did.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter's room is her safe space not only did you allowed your step daughter to enter without your daughter's permission you also gave away her stuff which you no right to at all\n\nWhat you did was making sure that your daughter resents your new family even more because you're obviously putting all of the blame on your daughter for them not having a relationship and taking your new family's side", "YTA! I was a cheerleader 6 years ago and I strongly remember my coaches saying to be mindful of how you represent your school in the uniforms, whether in real life or on social media. Also my uniforms were tailored to my exact body shape so if the step sister stretched them out that would be a problem. Not to mention these uniforms were almost $1000. But the biggest issue is that they are HER uniforms and you didn't consider her opinion.", "Um why the heck is she in your daughters room just for a mirror? Does your house not have at least *one* bathroom with a damn mirror? YTA big time guy! Stop trying to force a relationship between the two of them and start respecting your bio daughters boundaries! If you don't I can guarantee you she'll be peacing out of your life once she's legally able to. From now on tell step kid to stay out of your daughters room and no more asking *you* to try on clothes! Not that hard to respect other people's personal objects and privacy!", "YTA for the many reasons listed below wrt you absolutely invalidating so much stuff for your daughter. But oh my god if you want to get your daughter and stepdaughter to be closer obviously the best way to do that is to not immediately tell your stepdaughter to get out of your daughter's room and then let her borrow an item of clothing that isn't yours.

She thinks she can go into your daughter's room and use her things without asking. Sure she asked you because she knew you'd allow it because you are trying too hard to bring everyone together but you're actually pushing your daughter away. How would you feel if your daughter brought someone into your home and said to you he's part of the family now, you have to like them, oh and by the way feel free to go into my dad's room anytime you want even if he isn't here and use whatever you want.

You don\u2019t just make the decision to lend your daughter\u2019s clothes to someone else. Let alone behind her back.\n\nThat step sister is weird AF for wanting to look herself in the mirror IN your daughter\u2019s room? There is no bathroom/other mirrors in the house?

You said your stepdaughter could do something and it made your daughter upset. Ergo you made your daughter upset. Why is it that you don't think you did anything wrong? Because you didn't correctly anticipate the way your daughter would react? That's on you, not her. Your failure to understand your daughter is not her fault. You think a normal teen would've been okay with sharing her outfit (you're wrong about this too by the way) and so your daughter is not acting \"normal\" and that upsets. \n\nGet over it and apologize to your daughter. Oh, and make it clear to you adult stepdaughter that she can't take a child's things without permission.", "YTA, at a certain age, my biological sister and I couldn't be in the same room without fighting. Sharing clothes would have caused a war. (BTW, we are best friends now), but you have totally overstepped the mark.", "YTA and a little too old to even be asking why. Get a grip brotha I know you mean well trying to foster a good relationship with your step daughter but you did it at the expense of your own daughter. Step daughter should ask your daughter to use her things not you. She probably asked you because she knew your own daughter would say no. Step daughter also shouldn\u2019t be in your daughters room without her permission. Also step daughter is a full grown adult not a child like yours.", "YTA When someone asks if they can use something, you should think is that thing mine? Not did I pay for it but does it belong to me or someone else? If the answer to that question is no, then you are not allowed to make decisions about someone else using it. You need to either say no or ask the person who it belongs to. \n\nSome teenage girls don't mind sharing clothes with each other but even if they don't (and some just straight up won't) that doesn't necessarily mean they are willing to share with anybody and it doesn't necessarily mean that you are willing to share every item you possess. Some things are more delicate. Some clothes will stretch. \n\nRemember, when you ASSUME you make an ass out of U and Me, as you have done here.", "To say nothing of potentially being liable for replacement if the uniform is damaged. Or even the cost of dry cleaning if it gets dirty.", "cutting contact because of sibling relationships would be a bit extreme\u2026", "^^ this is super correct. Maybe it\u2019s my public school education but I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s not actually the daughters uniform. It\u2019s the property of the school.", "Where do they wear what we called lollipops in the 80s and spanks pants in the 90s without underwear? They go over your underwear, like what you used to wear under a tennis skirt. Actually as a matter of fact the spanks pants went over a body suit that went over underwear. When we changed to the new style uniforms from sweaters."]}
