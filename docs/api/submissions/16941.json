There are a few things I should have included.\n1. He still is in the house. I told him the stipulation of being able to stay was to not entertain or talk to another person out of respect to myself and the kids.\n2. I've done everything for this man including paying all the bills because he didn't like his job. He doesn't realize how much everything actually costs. \n3.

It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and betrayed by your partner's sudden request for a break and his suspicious texting behavior. However, demanding to read his messages as a condition for fixing your relationship isn't the healthiest approach. Relationships should be built on trust and open communication, not on snooping through each other's private conversations. It's important to address your concerns and suspicions with your partner directly, expressing your need for transparency and reassurance. Just like going to the dentist, it's best to approach the situation with open dialogue and a willingness to understand each other's perspectives rather than resorting to invasive measures.", "YTA can't imagine what would make him want a break from this relationship.", "YTA.

What about love, affection, intimacy or have you constantly told him what you have done for him and how little financially he has done and how grateful he should be to you for all the sacrifices you feel you have made for him, because the way you write this post give a strong impression you might have done.

As a sufferer of DV for 20 years I get that it's hard to leave. You are being presented with an opportunity to GTFO of this one sided relationship.  Take it!! Also, what country are you from?

He didn\u2019t ask to salvage or work on anything. So why would he show you his texts? \n\nI know it\u2019s tough to leave someone you have kids with. But for your kids\u2019 sake find the strength. Don\u2019t let them grow up in an environment in which their parents at best resent each other, and at worst are actively physically violent.

Many years ago, I found myself suspicious of my bf and sought out a way to view his WhatsApp messages. Upon googling how to proceed in such a case, I found a comment that if this is what it has come to, then it's automatically the time to let go. I let go. I moved on to a better person. Also, he was a broke-ass mf I realized that I had been spending all my money on him. That time taught me a lot.", "Regarding reading his texts, YTA.\n\nThere is way more behind this though, which is a lack of trust, that comes from something that has happened before (and might not have anything to do with him).\n\nIt feels like a lot of information is missing as I can not for the life of me understand how you'd turn your back on a family that doesn't support domestic abuse. The relationship seems very unhealthy, you need too much from this man, and (with what limited information we have) it seems like you are not capable of being happy with yourself/ being independent therefore are not able to leave him and create a better environment for you and the kids. He is kinda giving you an out... it might be scary but maybe you should consider taking it and then heal the relationship with a bit more distance (if that is still something you both would want). \n\nIn another comment, you said he is working on his anger management. It might also be a good idea to get away from all of that until he has everything under control and faced all of his issues, for your safety but also the safety of your kids. \n\nIf you take a break and get psychological help, it might help fix the foundations of the relationship OR you might find out that you are worth much more.\n\nI really hope you can get a better quality of life out of this experience and I'm very sad that you have to go through this, good luck!", "NTA..I've been here..it's devastating..you just want the truth. If your gut is telling you he's up to no good you are most likely right.

Reverse the genders and people would call this abuse.", "This is the bottom line. There\u2019s nothing to salvage. Kick him out, get a custody agreement in writing, and move on. He doesn\u2019t get to break up with you then ask to stay around for free or get your financial support anymore. He doesn\u2019t get to abuse you or your child. What is seeing his phone really going to change?? You\u2019re worth much more than this.", "You're being TA to yourself and your child for sticking with this absolute monster.

It will take a long time to heal but you will heal from this\u2026", ">Anger management? Has nothing to do with DV. It's about control.\n\nThis is an insane statement. Anger management is literally about controlling your anger. It's in the name. You do not know the psychological reasons why he committed DV so you can't say anger had nothing to do with it.", "There are rarely psychological reasons to commit DV. If you read \"Why Does He Do That\" by Lundy Bancroft, whose career has been dedicated to rehabilitating violent and abusive men and protecting women and children, you'll see, unfortunately, it's not an insane statement.\n\nAnger is a tool to get control. Abusers can control their anger enough to work, to have friends, to function in life, but use it to abuse and control their partners. It's a choice and an excuse to continue abusing their partners. The same excuse is used for alcohol and drug addiction - \n\n\"I abuse because I'm angry\" is actually \"I abuse, and anger is the excuse I use to continue abusing\" \n\nThe same as \"I abuse because I'm addicted\" is actually \"I abuse, and my addiction is the excuse I use to continue abusing\" \n\nPlenty of people have anger management issues or addiction issues and DON'T abuse their partners. It's not an excuse.\n\nVery, very rare unless extreme mental illness is present for anger management to be a factor in rehabilitating DV.\n\nI can't underline enough how reading the literature around this is vital to improving education and awareness about DV."]}
