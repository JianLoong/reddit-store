There are a few things I should have included.\n1. He still is in the house. I told him the stipulation of being able to stay was to not entertain or talk to another person out of respect to myself and the kids.\n2. I've done everything for this man including paying all the bills because he didn't like his job. He doesn't realize how much everything actually costs. \n3. I lost my whole family when I wouldn't press charges on him fore a dv2 charge and everyone where we live is his family.

It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and betrayed by your partner's sudden request for a break and his suspicious texting behavior. However, demanding to read his messages as a condition for fixing your relationship isn't the healthiest approach. Relationships should be built on trust and open communication, not on snooping through each other's private conversations. It's important to address your concerns and suspicions with your partner directly, expressing your need for transparency and reassurance. Just like going to the dentist, it's best to approach the situation with open dialogue and a willingness to understand each other's perspectives rather than resorting to invasive measures.", "YTA can't imagine what would make him want a break from this relationship.", "YTA.
