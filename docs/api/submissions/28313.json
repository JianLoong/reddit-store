She gets upset because I\u2019m not going all out even though I don\u2019t like being the center of attention nor do I have a date to even put in the effort to look that good. They all look the same but with a different price tag anyway\n\nMy mom then tries to tell me that I\u2019m making a mistake and how I need a better suit so I\u2019m not wearing something different, I ask her how I\u2019m going to pay for it because I\u2019m saving for a new computer and I have to be cheap for a little bit so I can replace my slow buggy computer, ive sent it to get repaired but it came back worse so I gave up. I ask her if she\u2019s going to pay for it and she gets upset and tell me that I have to buy it, i offer that we split the cost and she declines again so I tell her. \u201cMom, if you aren\u2019t going to help me buy it im not going to buy a whole new suit. Im just going to reuse my last suit, i really don\u2019t need to buy anything else if it still fits, at most I need a new shirt.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t obvious I hate buying new clothes and only buy something if the other one is ripped or worn down. This suit was only put on once so i ok with using it again.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much she brought it for because she refused to tell me the price all I know that it wasn\u2019t cheap\n\nShe told me that she just wanted her Young man to be well dressed and I said I felt well dressed. She then got my sister on my case and thought that I should buy a cheap suit at the least and tried to guilt trip me into going with her. \n\nOnce again I said No, and said that I should go to the last store we went to when I brought the suit but I declined because the workers tried to make me look flamboyant and their inputs were uncomfortable to wear and rarely fit. So I picked a white shirt and black pants in my size at random so I could go home and luckily it was perfect. So now my mom and sister think I\u2019m being a picky A-Hole about it because I don\u2019t want to go clothes shopping with them and buy something with my money.
