I work from home and have a street-facing office in front of a window, which means I can see all pedestrians as they walk past.\n\nEvery day, probably 20-30 dog walkers pass by with their dogs, and many of them stop and pee on my lawn and/or garden bed. It really irks me and I have noticed in particular, one dog owner. He is a teenage kid with a Great Dane and a border collie, both of which he walks off leash (this is legal in my city). Every single time, his dogs wander all the way up my lawn, often so that they're closer to the house than to the sidewalk. They almost always take a pee on my rose bushes and on the lawn, and often one or both will stop and poop.\n\nThis morning, the kid was walking by and both his dogs pee. His Great Dane then begins squatting to poop, so I decide to come out and confront him. I start yelling at him, telling him to get his dogs off my lawn. He was quite upset, and tried to explain to me that he didn't realise it was wrong. He told me that most people in the neighbourhood have dogs, and they are mostly all fine with dogs on their lawn as long as the poop is cleaned up. He says he makes sure they don't pee on visibly well kept gardens or ornaments (mailboxes, pot plants, etc.) and says that since there is no nature strip it's really the only place for them to go. He said he'd be happy to avoid my house in future, as he recalls them when passing houses with signs as well. I think he was quite shaken by my confrontation.\n\nAITA for telling him off? I feel that it might be the neighbourhood norm and in that case I'm the asshole, but surely it's not normal to tolerate dogs toileting over your yard?  \n\n\nEdit: He, and all the other owners, all pick up their dog's poop.

But would walk their dog *straight* across, let it do everything, not pick up anything, and walk straight back indoors again.\n\nPolitely asking them to stop met with argument and excuse, so politely asked again (maybe it took a few times of this, and this was after the yard was FULL of their dog's poo, fwiw; which we had to pick up all of) (not visible at first but when mowing lawn or walking through grass, seeing it again and again), and then they *finally* said they wouldn't.

But happened to walk for our yard, again, while I was looking out a window -- they stopped, looked surprised, turned around and walked straight back into their house -- it was pretty funny because, unplanned.)\n\nThe expensive shrubs were dying btw. Had to be replaced more than once. Others also tended to let their dogs lift a leg walking past, since it seemed to be a handy spot on dog walks...(yet plenty of curbs, the roads, and nearby parks and empty lands.) *Many people do this because then it's someone else's problem, and they don't want to go very far from home to do it.*\n\nIf the person lives in a neighborhood which is not set up well for dogs, they do not have to choose to adopt one; or can make other plans (places to toilet), if they already had a dog.

Ours does, but people still leave it to *let their dog squat or lift leg on the land or plants*.

I've also seen people walk a dog, and it goes poo as it walks (not ill or old dog but the owner drags it too fast and won't stop), and the owner, just keeps going...and other people step in it.\n\n\\> Again human fault because they don't train their dogs not the dogs fault.\n\nBut no one has blamed the dogs. They are obeying or following their owners/humans.\n\nI'm waiting to hear from OP how they said things and etc. but overall I think people are not correct in using other people's land for a toilet. The **dog feces and urine has as many germs** as any other kind. (Also not always possible to pick up a poo if it's not that solid; and urine can't be at all, but kills plants.)\n\nI'm not upset with anyone here btw.

OP literally reflected as they did it and felt a little sorry.", "They need to find a park or field and walk him there to do his business. I know you can't just have a big ass work dog and think he's gonna be happy on the couch all day.", "That's your viewpoint.  I don't agree.", "It\u2019s a front garden, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s property, I just don\u2019t understand what would possess someone to let their dog shit in someone else\u2019s garden, maybe it\u2019s an American thing but that would not be considered normal behaviour anywhere else I\u2019ve been.", "Checked out your comment history and your hatred of anything dog. I can ASSURE you that you are the weirdo in this regard. Seems like you have stick up your ass in regards to dogs", "Are you being purposely obtuse? \n\nDo you really not understand the difference between a squirrel peeing in your yard and a dog?\n\nYes, sometimes wild bunnies get into my garden and eat my plants. That doesn't suddenly make it okay for you to let your dog dick holes in my garden\n\nAnd yes you have control over your pet. Is that news to you? Why is that some shocking revelation?", "Is the dog squatting over somebody else's lawn? Then who the fuck cares if it's a piss or a shit... YES! you yank on that lead! Ruin your own property!", "Lol I was reading the comments I thought you were the one getting pretty worked up", "People on Reddit always think I am having a meltdown when I disagree with them on something. I am always actually unbothered and a little amused", "I\u2019m just answering the question of are they the AH for going off. Yes. They absolutely had good reasons to speak to the person, but not to rage at them for a first interaction.", "OP could have simply spoken reasonably to this young person instead of losing their shit at them.", "Technically it\u2019s not. Most cities in America have an easement that goes a few feet off the side walk onto someone\u2019s lawn.", "I\u2019m not offended by a random calling me a weirdo for my severe dislike of dogs MAINLY because of how disgusting and untrained they are. IF they weren\u2019t treated like people and IF their owners took ownership of them and IF people didn\u2019t act like they should take up every single space that actual people should, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem. I have had a dog as a kid and it was absolutely nothing like this and I didn\u2019t believe that I was entitled to let it piss and shit on people\u2019s lawns. I can assure that there is a LARGE number of people who dislike dogs or animals in general. I just have no problem making that known \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nIt\u2019s always people who let dogs kiss them in the mouth calling non-dog people out. I\u2019ll sit happily with that stick, thanks.", ">Do you really not understand the difference between a squirrel peeing in your yard and a dog?\n\nThe grass certainly doesn't see a difference. My shoes don't see a difference. So no, I don't see a difference. Piss is piss and it's gonna get on your lawn regardless. Maybe find a hobby or something. Surely you have something better to worry about or some other way to let your meager power go to your head.", "So you just have to wait until/if the dog squats somewhere appropriate? Have fun being outside for an hour and having the dog eventually just not go and then go in your house I guess.", "lmao nothing says \"I'm chill\" more than going through someone's comments to respond to ones you're not even involved in \ud83d\ude02", "Totally, that's why you're replying to the comments of like 15 people. Very unbothered. Very amused.", "Wow I'm sorry that volume is a foreign concept to you , I'm not really sure how you've survived this long without understanding it. \n\nBelieve it or not gardening is one of my hobbies and entitled and disrespectful dog owners who think it's perfectly acceptable to allow their dogs to piss in and trample over my flowerbeds are going to piss me off. \n\nYes piss is going to get on my lawn, squirrels rabbits and chipmunks aren't pissing enough to ruin my flower bed. Dogs are, especially when they start marking, so every dog starts pissing there. \n\nWild animals are doing it, so I can do it too, is an absolutely entitled point of view. \n\nDo you think it's fine to pluck peppers and tomatoes from my garden because wild animals sometimes get into them?", "Why would that happen to me? I'm not an irresponsible pet owner.", "Can't read a thread lol"]}
