I work from home and have a street-facing office in front of a window, which means I can see all pedestrians as they walk past.\n\nEvery day, probably 20-30 dog walkers pass by with their dogs, and many of them stop and pee on my lawn and/or garden bed. It really irks me and I have noticed in particular, one dog owner. He is a teenage kid with a Great Dane and a border collie, both of which he walks off leash (this is legal in my city). Every single time, his dogs wander all the way up my lawn, often so that they're closer to the house than to the sidewalk. They almost always take a pee on my rose bushes and on the lawn, and often one or both will stop and poop.\n\nThis morning, the kid was walking by and both his dogs pee. His Great Dane then begins squatting to poop, so I decide to come out and confront him. I start yelling at him, telling him to get his dogs off my lawn. He was quite upset, and tried to explain to me that he didn't realise it was wrong. He told me that most people in the neighbourhood have dogs, and they are mostly all fine with dogs on their lawn as long as the poop is cleaned up. He says he makes sure they don't pee on visibly well kept gardens or ornaments (mailboxes, pot plants, etc.) and says that since there is no nature strip it's really the only place for them to go. He said he'd be happy to avoid my house in future, as he recalls them when passing houses with signs as well. I think he was quite shaken by my confrontation.\n\nAITA for telling him off? I feel that it might be the neighbourhood norm and in that case I'm the asshole, but surely it's not normal to tolerate dogs toileting over your yard?  \n\n\nEdit: He, and all the other owners, all pick up their dog's poop.

They are inexpensive and can give a \"visual barrier\" to your yard. Any dogs would have to step OVER A FENCE to use your yard. A visual barrier would give the hint to the dog walkers on your block that their \"deposits\" are not welcome on your lawn.

But when kept on leash, they still stay in the area nearer the public road, while off leash they could go right up to your house and I could see getting preoccupied by it if you\u2019re facing the street from your desk every day.

People could build a dog run, have one of those astroturf stations indoors, not adopt a dog that is too large for them to handle, (i.e. has to go toilet outside), or not adopt a dog full stop. I love dogs but haven't adopted one because of this.\n\nNeighbors have theirs poo on the lawn, against the law btw, and leave it as often as not; I have not confronted any because of various reasons including it often happens at night, and by the time the smell wafts in they're gone besides.\n\n(Re 'they had no land') Long time ago (different neighborhood) there was a neighbor, directly across, (they just had to cross a street; not a city street, but a  usually empty, small road), who had a bigger house than we had and a *bigger* *yard* too. But would walk their dog *straight* across, let it do everything, not pick up anything, and walk straight back indoors again.\n\nPolitely asking them to stop met with argument and excuse, so politely asked again (maybe it took a few times of this, and this was after the yard was FULL of their dog's poo, fwiw; which we had to pick up all of) (not visible at first but when mowing lawn or walking through grass, seeing it again and again), and then they *finally* said they wouldn't. (They still did! But happened to walk for our yard, again, while I was looking out a window -- they stopped, looked surprised, turned around and walked straight back into their house -- it was pretty funny because, unplanned.)\n\nThe expensive shrubs were dying btw. Had to be replaced more than once. Others also tended to let their dogs lift a leg walking past, since it seemed to be a handy spot on dog walks...(yet plenty of curbs, the roads, and nearby parks and empty lands.) *Many people do this because then it's someone else's problem, and they don't want to go very far from home to do it.*\n\nIf the person lives in a neighborhood which is not set up well for dogs, they do not have to choose to adopt one; or can make other plans (places to toilet), if they already had a dog. Using *a neighbor's land as a toilet* should not be seen as a viable option.\n\n\\> in other countries homes are gated so there is no chance someone walks on it .\n\nThere are some gated homes or neighborhoods in the U. S. also, and homes with cement fences and spikes on top, but it's more often open yards, yes.\n\nA neighborhood might or might not have sidewalks. Ours does, but people still leave it to *let their dog squat or lift leg on the land or plants*.  And often leave it...(which stinks), and on a nice day the window must then shut...There are dog parks (here), empty lands or lots, and a sidewalk and a curb. I've also seen people walk a dog, and it goes poo as it walks (not ill or old dog but the owner drags it too fast and won't stop), and the owner, just keeps going...and other people step in it.\n\n\\> Again human fault because they don't train their dogs not the dogs fault.\n\nBut no one has blamed the dogs. They are obeying or following their owners/humans.\n\nI'm waiting to hear from OP how they said things and etc. but overall I think people are not correct in using other people's land for a toilet. The **dog feces and urine has as many germs** as any other kind. (Also not always possible to pick up a poo if it's not that solid; and urine can't be at all, but kills plants.)\n\nI'm not upset with anyone here btw. I am just sharing viewpoints so even if we disagree, it's OK. People will always do what they want in the end.", "That's the teenagers problem not op. OP does not live in the dogs toilet, I'm sure if he walked them different ways every day and kinda spread the business around...op wouldn't have as much of an issue.", "But it's up to the dog owner to find a public space for the dog to do business rather than just use people's yards. \n\nThis isn't OPs problem to solve,", ">It\u2019s unfortunately pretty common and pretty much means the dogs are definitely going to pee in   \n>  \n>someone\u2019s  \n>  \n> yard. \n\nIt shouldn't, but why not in their own then?
