Your child comes first!!!", "NTA.. Tell them to get a hotel or reschedule.", "Your child is so ill they had to go to the hospital. I'm not sure why they would still want to come. NTA.

If they can\u2019t find other accommodations you could always offer them a tent lol.", "Yeah I get it. I mean I honestly don't completely disagree here. Part of me is just playing the other side since everyone else is saying NTA. \n\nI get it. I just feel like it wouldn't be a huge deal and you all could figure it out without inconveniencing your friends or making them cancel their trip. Are there flight tickets involved, etc?", "Are they friends with the others? I would ask for floor space, get an air mattress, etc if I couldn't afford a hotel. I would not impose on a family with a sick kid. I can understand not being able to afford a hotel. We just needed to be in Philadelphia this past weekend for college graduation. Between college graduations, mother's day, and 3 days of Taylor swift, the hotel prices were jacked up. We had hotel points, but still.", "Nope, they\u2019re driving from about 3 hours away. Of course paying to stay somewhere absolutely sucks, regardless of it they can afford it. I feel really bad. But the concert will keep us out late, and I love them but they aren\u2019t used to being quiet in a house with a sick kid. It sucks all around and I do feel like TA.", "So wait, you all are planning on going to a concert? Would you lose out on the tickets if you cancelled the trip? And, if they did come but stayed elsewhere, would you still plan on going to the concert?", "It\u2019s a free concert (minus the bar\u2019s cover charge) and yes, I would still go. It doesn\u2019t start until after bedtime and my partner would stay home that night with our son."]}
