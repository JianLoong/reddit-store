This hinges on predator like behavior. Your brother and SIL stalked and exploited a young pregnant woman who was simply asking for vital nutrients for her baby and not seeking to put her child up for eventual adoption. I'm guessing they were also doing this to other vulnerable woman in similar circumstances.\n\nYou are NTA, I commend you for helping as much as you are, especially at the risk of harsh retaliation from your family.

THAT IS INSANELY PREDATORY BEHAVIOR!!! They're basically looking for someone too broke to say no to *selling their child*. There are legit adoption agencies that can facilitate this kind of thing instead of trolling for preggos on FB and then trying to convince them that they don't want their kid. \n\n  \nWow. Good for you, OP, for asking the mom what she actually wanted. It sounds like no one did that until you did. I'm sure it's not going to be easy for her in the future, but you of all people know that being a young mother isn't impossible.", "NTA, sounds like she didn't really want to give up her baby in the first place, and your brother and SIL targeted her.", "NTA so so much. Your bro and SIL are taking advantage of an incredibly vulnerable young woman. You\u2019re amazing for helping her to keep her baby. I wish more people in the world were like you", "NTA\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, your brother and SIL are absolutely disgusting. They went looking for posts for people they thought they could manipulate into giving away their baby. Extremely predatory. \n\nThey are probably searching for other potential victims, only now you will not be included in the process.", "NTA\nWhat they did was predatory. \n\nGood on you.", "NTA and this is a perfect example as to why private domestic adoption is so [unethical](https://time.com/6051811/private-adoption-america/) to me. Rich couples taking babies from poor, struggling women after convincing them they have no other options. It\u2019s a sick industry with no federal regulation that treats human beings like a product to be bought and profited off of.

What they did was horrible. And I'm pretty sure illegal in a lot of places.", "NTA you didn\u2019t screw up their adoption.  You stopped them from stealing someone\u2019s baby.  They preyed on her, this was not someone looking to put their baby up for adoption, this is someone they used their wealth to prey on.  Your Brother and SIL are bad people.", "NTA but your brother and wife suck.\n\nThey are exploiting poor people while actively watching them suffer.\n\nPlease tell them that tossing coins to homeless guys should give them the same enjoyment without going through something that is almost human trafficking.\n\nP.s.

Now I can go to sleep with a smile on my face, holding my 3 month old daughter. Thank you OP", "NTA. \n\nSarah didn\u2019t want to give up her son, but felt she had no other option. You, out of the kindness of your heart, gave her another option. Your brother and SIL should go through an adoption agency if they want to adopt a child.

If someone wants to keep their child, and is only giving up the child because of a lack of necessary support and resources, then the best case scenario is that they find the support and resources they need so they can raise their own child. This woman felt trapped and you were able to give her the freedom she needed to truly make a choice in the situation. Your brother and sister-in-law are probably devastated after getting their hopes up, but it\u2019s best if they adopt a child who really needs to be adopted, rather than a child whose mother just needed some help.", "NTA and you're a literal angel!! Amazing", "NTA. No one is entitled to a baby, especially someone else's. If I understand correctly, they contacted this woman *knowing she was financially in need* and then pressured her into considering adoption. Then, mom openly expressed sadness and reluctance at her choice.

At a minimum she should not have supported the adoption going forward.", "So essentially your brother and SIL found a pregnant teen struggling in poverty, and talked her into giving them her baby.\n\nNTA.

You sympathised with a person going through an incredibly hard life choice which no one who hasn't been in that situation could appreciate and offered her an alternative so that she wouldn't feel pressured into making a decision that she may come to regret for the rest of her life. She then chose to do what she felt was best for her and her child. That's not your fault, she could just have easily gone \"actually nah, it's gonna be hard but I want my freedom\"", "NTA. Brother and SIL are predatory, reaching out to random teenagers in online groups who can't even afford prenatal vitamins? They're looking for someone young to take advantage of.

That\u2019s super amazing you are helping Sarah", "Nta at all!", "NTA you brother and sil are taking advantage of a young and poor woman and basically manipulating her to hand over their baby. This is not the correct way to get a baby. What you did is fantastic and I applaud you for that.", "NTA. It sounds like your brother hasn't reckoned with the moral and economic realities of the adoption system. In large part, many children are available for adoption not by choice, but because their birth parents can't financially afford to care for them, which is a failure that our society hasn't chosen to resolve.\n\nYou didn't face that choice because of your affluence, and you're choosing to further use your affluence to remove that systemic issue in this one instance for this one person. You can't do it for everyone, but for this one individual you can.\n\nYou gave someone a choice where they thought they didn't have one. Your brother is learning the hard way that, when given a choice, this individual doesn't want what he's offering.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her a real choice. She chose motherhood", "NTA.\n\nBrother and SIL reduced it to a business transaction with someone they knew didn't have a lot of other options --- and in those terms the supplier got a better offer.

For a 24 year old with a 7 year old child you have a lot of money to help out someone you barely know. I have sympathy for Sara and I wish single parents had more resources to help them out. I also hope Sarah gets a restraining order against you Brother and SIL.\n\nYTA if for any reason you don't follow up. Even if you or your son have a medical emergency that drains your savings you owe it to Sarah to give her the money you promised and to not rush her on repayments. Even if Sarah behaves in a way you don't approve of (drugs, boyfriend, school drop out), you owe her that money.\n\nSarah is making a life changing decision because of a promise you are making.

Ignore them. \n\nYou're giving a mother and child a chance to stay together and it's going to mean the world to them.

That kid is going to grow up knowing who his real mom is, his mom has a chance to give her son the best possible life with her, and they're going to have a future together. \n\nI'm so glad that there's amazing people like you out there. I work in a field where I see a lot of bad shit, and this post made me so happy to hear some good out there. I teared up a bit there.\n\nKeep being your beautiful self, ignore your brother and his wife and don't let their negativity get to you. What you did is wonderful.", "NTA\n\nYou helped a young mother to be. It would have always be difficult. For the woman as well as for your brother if the woman might have been in the picture. Yes it is bad for your brother and his wife. Because they really were invested. Don't know if this would be possible, but if they can see the point of the young mother and why she loves her child and don't want to give it away, maybe your brother could offer to be god parents? Like yeah they also have build a bond with the child so maybe it would be a way (if they can seperate from 'this would have be our child' to 'it is great, that the child is happy').\n\nIs it possible in your country to get a surrogate mother? Or can they go to a place where it is allowed? Before the war this was a possible in the Ukrain (and I think it still is, but who know). Woman rent out their womb for a couple to get a child. They even can use their own eggs and or sperm or some of a sperm/egg bank. And those woman - even if it is still a question if it is okay to take advantage of such person, who need the money and sell their body - know what they are in for. They shouldn't form a bond with the child. Could be a better way to get a child and be involved in all the appointments.", "NTA\n\nyour brother and his wife are literally preying on underprivileged women. if they have the money (and, probably, the connections), why don't they just go through the regular process of adoption? smh. they should be ashamed of themselves. they can't use their money to buy people.", "NTA bless your soul and wish nothing but peace for both of you and child.", "Nta she didn't want to give up her baby", "NTA.

Being cut off from your biology, having no genetic mirrors, always feeling a little bit out of place, struggling with feeling unwanted - adoption is always traumatic.

Adoption rules are looser for Americans since they pay for children and orphanages can help more kids if they give up a few of them to white saviours. It's almost literally child trafficking.

My life has been filled with more joy, more love, more laughter than one can even imagine because of the gifts of being allowed to mother someone else's children when the children were in need.    \n\n\nI am a very active and vocal advocate for adoption, fostering and reunification.  I'm an advocate for open adoption and for opening past adoption records if the adoptee is wanting past records. But you see I'm an advocate for children much more than for parents.  I believe & so does my husband that adoption should never be about the wants & needs of the parent but only about the need of the child.   We're odd I know.  And this post is far too long.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS Another ethical resource is most US denominational homes for unwed mothers. But always.........ALWAYS do your research.  There have been some true atrocities committed.", "I understand,  and they'd probably try and threaten it. Those contracts are predatory and agencies and lawyers are use them often. However they aren't enforceable in majority of courts due to laws surrounding adoption.", "You actually have to pay a surrogate a good amount rather than just the bare minimum to get through pregnancy.", "better yet: do this the day *after* Easter, when the chocolate bunnies are half off", "OP, I have given you my judgement and input earlier. Good on you ensuring she contacts social services and making sure this is all done properly", "No, of course not. But it could save her an extra step if you prepaid a couple months of rent directly to her landlord and arranged for diapers through Amazon, or whatever. I'm not suggesting this because you don't trust her, but just to minimize awkwardness if she's touchy about her pride.", "Nah, they have their own episode, lol", "Ohh they got their own movie..The Magdalene Sisters..shows how those 'convents' really thought and what some of those priests did", "It was focussing specifically on Georgia Tann so I don\u2019t believe the Irish Catholic Church was brought up. They definitely have their own episode though", "Nice! I'll look into that one.", "It depends on the state, but I don't know of any state that allows revocation of TPR (without legal cause) up to the finalization order.\n\nSome states have no revocation period at all; once TPR is signed, that's it. New York State (where we live + where our children were born + adopted) has a 30-day revocation period. At one time California had a revocation period of 6 months, but I don't know if that's changed. But once that period is up it is next to impossible to revoke TPR if everything was done legally.", "This is just shocking. There is a movie titled 'Philomena' starring Judith Dench and Steve Coogan that highlights this issue\n\nOh my goodness this is just cruel on those poor mothers", "It happened in Chicago too.", "The list is mostly made of equally higher income people so money alone is not gonna get you that far - that's why people use predatory tactics like this couple or adopt a kid from a poor country.", "And agency might reject them, too.", "They\u2019re also disproportionately not white. Many people want newborn white babies, with a slight preference to girls. There are thousands of children in the foster care system that are eligible for adoption today. Most will not be. It\u2019s so messed up.", "Exactly.  So many adoptive parents have a fantasy they want to fulfill.  And often they think if they don't get a child newborn the child will never bond with them, which is so not true.", "I disagree only on one point, we see many situations where a child needs to be removed. However, they need temporary removal not adoption. The parent may need rehab, training, job training, something and reunification is the right answer.  And you probably meant that very thing!   Terminating rights should be the very last option in the foster system.", "Cop here. Don't be so sure of that.  You'd be surprised how fucked up cps here and the foster system is.", "True but seems like money isn\u2019t the issue here. Doesn\u2019t sound like they really want to go through the legit process of it either.", "There is a repayment schedule. It says the girl insisted on it in the post.", "Anyway, you're a hero for helping her like this. That whole situation is heartbreaking.", "I remember watching that movie so long ago with my very Irish Catholic grandmother. \n\nI remember it ending and wondering how TF my grandmother could still follow such a religion.", "Thanks for giving me even more reasons to be pro choice! We gotta keep the fight for our rights alive!", "My Grandpa was about 2-3 years old when he was adopted. His birth parents died during the Spanish Flu pandemic and my great grandparents adopted him not long after. He was very close to them even after finding out he was adopted when he was older.", "They make it clear that foster to adopt is unlikely and a very long process.", "There is still a lot less chance that a kid has been taken away just cause they can be basically sold to a western couple. I know some kids get taken for unnecessary reasons sometimes, but it's not as frequent as shady orphanage and shady private agencies. There isn't enough oversight, especially in the US over private adoption to make it safe...", "It\u2019s like billionaires who pay their workers crumbs despite having enough to go around. Why pay the extra money when you can prey on vulnerable people?", "I'm sorry to have to tell you this but you're deluding yourself.  the system is rigged against poor people and against those who hold the wrong views.", "Absolutely agree! Disgusting!", "Still not sure what permanently exhausted pigeon means but dang the mental image is *hilarious*", "Nah, baby pigeons are super creepy looking, bet your little one is adorable! \n\nAnd seriously you've been warned if you look them up."]}
