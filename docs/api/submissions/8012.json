This hinges on predator like behavior. Your brother and SIL stalked and exploited a young pregnant woman who was simply asking for vital nutrients for her baby and not seeking to put her child up for eventual adoption. I'm guessing they were also doing this to other vulnerable woman in similar circumstances.\n\nYou are NTA, I commend you for helping as much as you are, especially at the risk of harsh retaliation from your family.

THAT IS INSANELY PREDATORY BEHAVIOR!!! They're basically looking for someone too broke to say no to *selling their child*. There are legit adoption agencies that can facilitate this kind of thing instead of trolling for preggos on FB and then trying to convince them that they don't want their kid. \n\n  \nWow. Good for you, OP, for asking the mom what she actually wanted. It sounds like no one did that until you did. I'm sure it's not going to be easy for her in the future, but you of all people know that being a young mother isn't impossible.", "NTA, sounds like she didn't really want to give up her baby in the first place, and your brother and SIL targeted her.", "NTA so so much. Your bro and SIL are taking advantage of an incredibly vulnerable young woman. You\u2019re amazing for helping her to keep her baby. I wish more people in the world were like you", "NTA\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, your brother and SIL are absolutely disgusting. They went looking for posts for people they thought they could manipulate into giving away their baby. Extremely predatory. \n\nThey are probably searching for other potential victims, only now you will not be included in the process.", "NTA\nWhat they did was predatory. \n\nGood on you.", "NTA and this is a perfect example as to why private domestic adoption is so [unethical](https://time.com/6051811/private-adoption-america/) to me. Rich couples taking babies from poor, struggling women after convincing them they have no other options. It\u2019s a sick industry with no federal regulation that treats human beings like a product to be bought and profited off of.

What they did was horrible. And I'm pretty sure illegal in a lot of places.", "NTA you didn\u2019t screw up their adoption.  You stopped them from stealing someone\u2019s baby.  They preyed on her, this was not someone looking to put their baby up for adoption, this is someone they used their wealth to prey on.  Your Brother and SIL are bad people.", "NTA but your brother and wife suck.\n\nThey are exploiting poor people while actively watching them suffer.\n\nPlease tell them that tossing coins to homeless guys should give them the same enjoyment without going through something that is almost human trafficking.\n\nP.s.

Now I can go to sleep with a smile on my face, holding my 3 month old daughter. Thank you OP", "NTA. \n\nSarah didn\u2019t want to give up her son, but felt she had no other option. You, out of the kindness of your heart, gave her another option. Your brother and SIL should go through an adoption agency if they want to adopt a child.

If someone wants to keep their child, and is only giving up the child because of a lack of necessary support and resources, then the best case scenario is that they find the support and resources they need so they can raise their own child. This woman felt trapped and you were able to give her the freedom she needed to truly make a choice in the situation. Your brother and sister-in-law are probably devastated after getting their hopes up, but it\u2019s best if they adopt a child who really needs to be adopted, rather than a child whose mother just needed some help.", "NTA and you're a literal angel!! Amazing", "NTA. No one is entitled to a baby, especially someone else's. If I understand correctly, they contacted this woman *knowing she was financially in need* and then pressured her into considering adoption. Then, mom openly expressed sadness and reluctance at her choice.

At a minimum she should not have supported the adoption going forward.", "So essentially your brother and SIL found a pregnant teen struggling in poverty, and talked her into giving them her baby.\n\nNTA.

You sympathised with a person going through an incredibly hard life choice which no one who hasn't been in that situation could appreciate and offered her an alternative so that she wouldn't feel pressured into making a decision that she may come to regret for the rest of her life. She then chose to do what she felt was best for her and her child. That's not your fault, she could just have easily gone \"actually nah, it's gonna be hard but I want my freedom\"", "NTA. Brother and SIL are predatory, reaching out to random teenagers in online groups who can't even afford prenatal vitamins? They're looking for someone young to take advantage of.

That\u2019s super amazing you are helping Sarah", "Nta at all!", "NTA you brother and sil are taking advantage of a young and poor woman and basically manipulating her to hand over their baby. This is not the correct way to get a baby. What you did is fantastic and I applaud you for that.", "NTA. It sounds like your brother hasn't reckoned with the moral and economic realities of the adoption system. In large part, many children are available for adoption not by choice, but because their birth parents can't financially afford to care for them, which is a failure that our society hasn't chosen to resolve.\n\nYou didn't face that choice because of your affluence, and you're choosing to further use your affluence to remove that systemic issue in this one instance for this one person. You can't do it for everyone, but for this one individual you can.\n\nYou gave someone a choice where they thought they didn't have one. Your brother is learning the hard way that, when given a choice, this individual doesn't want what he's offering.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her a real choice. She chose motherhood", "NTA.\n\nBrother and SIL reduced it to a business transaction with someone they knew didn't have a lot of other options --- and in those terms the supplier got a better offer.

For a 24 year old with a 7 year old child you have a lot of money to help out someone you barely know. I have sympathy for Sara and I wish single parents had more resources to help them out. I also hope Sarah gets a restraining order against you Brother and SIL.\n\nYTA if for any reason you don't follow up. Even if you or your son have a medical emergency that drains your savings you owe it to Sarah to give her the money you promised and to not rush her on repayments. Even if Sarah behaves in a way you don't approve of (drugs, boyfriend, school drop out), you owe her that money.\n\nSarah is making a life changing decision because of a promise you are making.

Ignore them. \n\nYou're giving a mother and child a chance to stay together and it's going to mean the world to them.

That kid is going to grow up knowing who his real mom is, his mom has a chance to give her son the best possible life with her, and they're going to have a future together. \n\nI'm so glad that there's amazing people like you out there. I work in a field where I see a lot of bad shit, and this post made me so happy to hear some good out there. I teared up a bit there.\n\nKeep being your beautiful self, ignore your brother and his wife and don't let their negativity get to you. What you did is wonderful.", "NTA\n\nYou helped a young mother to be. It would have always be difficult. For the woman as well as for your brother if the woman might have been in the picture. Yes it is bad for your brother and his wife. Because they really were invested. Don't know if this would be possible, but if they can see the point of the young mother and why she loves her child and don't want to give it away, maybe your brother could offer to be god parents? Like yeah they also have build a bond with the child so maybe it would be a way (if they can seperate from 'this would have be our child' to 'it is great, that the child is happy').\n\nIs it possible in your country to get a surrogate mother? Or can they go to a place where it is allowed? Before the war this was a possible in the Ukrain (and I think it still is, but who know). Woman rent out their womb for a couple to get a child. They even can use their own eggs and or sperm or some of a sperm/egg bank. And those woman - even if it is still a question if it is okay to take advantage of such person, who need the money and sell their body - know what they are in for. They shouldn't form a bond with the child. Could be a better way to get a child and be involved in all the appointments.", "NTA\n\nyour brother and his wife are literally preying on underprivileged women. if they have the money (and, probably, the connections), why don't they just go through the regular process of adoption? smh. they should be ashamed of themselves. they can't use their money to buy people.", "NTA bless your soul and wish nothing but peace for both of you and child.", "Nta she didn't want to give up her baby", "NTA.

Being cut off from your biology, having no genetic mirrors, always feeling a little bit out of place, struggling with feeling unwanted - adoption is always traumatic.

Adoption rules are looser for Americans since they pay for children and orphanages can help more kids if they give up a few of them to white saviours. It's almost literally child trafficking.
