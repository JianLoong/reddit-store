This hinges on predator like behavior. Your brother and SIL stalked and exploited a young pregnant woman who was simply asking for vital nutrients for her baby and not seeking to put her child up for eventual adoption. I'm guessing they were also doing this to other vulnerable woman in similar circumstances.\n\nYou are NTA, I commend you for helping as much as you are, especially at the risk of harsh retaliation from your family.

THAT IS INSANELY PREDATORY BEHAVIOR!!! They're basically looking for someone too broke to say no to *selling their child*. There are legit adoption agencies that can facilitate this kind of thing instead of trolling for preggos on FB and then trying to convince them that they don't want their kid. \n\n  \nWow. Good for you, OP, for asking the mom what she actually wanted. It sounds like no one did that until you did. I'm sure it's not going to be easy for her in the future, but you of all people know that being a young mother isn't impossible.", "NTA, sounds like she didn't really want to give up her baby in the first place, and your brother and SIL targeted her.", "NTA so so much. Your bro and SIL are taking advantage of an incredibly vulnerable young woman. You\u2019re amazing for helping her to keep her baby. I wish more people in the world were like you", "NTA\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, your brother and SIL are absolutely disgusting. They went looking for posts for people they thought they could manipulate into giving away their baby. Extremely predatory. \n\nThey are probably searching for other potential victims, only now you will not be included in the process.", "NTA\nWhat they did was predatory. \n\nGood on you.", "NTA and this is a perfect example as to why private domestic adoption is so [unethical](https://time.com/6051811/private-adoption-america/) to me. Rich couples taking babies from poor, struggling women after convincing them they have no other options. It\u2019s a sick industry with no federal regulation that treats human beings like a product to be bought and profited off of.

What they did was horrible. And I'm pretty sure illegal in a lot of places.", "NTA you didn\u2019t screw up their adoption.  You stopped them from stealing someone\u2019s baby.  They preyed on her, this was not someone looking to put their baby up for adoption, this is someone they used their wealth to prey on.  Your Brother and SIL are bad people.", "NTA but your brother and wife suck.\n\nThey are exploiting poor people while actively watching them suffer.\n\nPlease tell them that tossing coins to homeless guys should give them the same enjoyment without going through something that is almost human trafficking.\n\nP.s.

Now I can go to sleep with a smile on my face, holding my 3 month old daughter. Thank you OP", "NTA. \n\nSarah didn\u2019t want to give up her son, but felt she had no other option. You, out of the kindness of your heart, gave her another option. Your brother and SIL should go through an adoption agency if they want to adopt a child.

If someone wants to keep their child, and is only giving up the child because of a lack of necessary support and resources, then the best case scenario is that they find the support and resources they need so they can raise their own child. This woman felt trapped and you were able to give her the freedom she needed to truly make a choice in the situation. Your brother and sister-in-law are probably devastated after getting their hopes up, but it\u2019s best if they adopt a child who really needs to be adopted, rather than a child whose mother just needed some help.", "NTA and you're a literal angel!! Amazing", "NTA. No one is entitled to a baby, especially someone else's. If I understand correctly, they contacted this woman *knowing she was financially in need* and then pressured her into considering adoption. Then, mom openly expressed sadness and reluctance at her choice.

At a minimum she should not have supported the adoption going forward.", "So essentially your brother and SIL found a pregnant teen struggling in poverty, and talked her into giving them her baby.\n\nNTA.

You sympathised with a person going through an incredibly hard life choice which no one who hasn't been in that situation could appreciate and offered her an alternative so that she wouldn't feel pressured into making a decision that she may come to regret for the rest of her life. She then chose to do what she felt was best for her and her child. That's not your fault, she could just have easily gone \"actually nah, it's gonna be hard but I want my freedom\"", "NTA. Brother and SIL are predatory, reaching out to random teenagers in online groups who can't even afford prenatal vitamins? They're looking for someone young to take advantage of.

That\u2019s super amazing you are helping Sarah", "Nta at all!", "NTA you brother and sil are taking advantage of a young and poor woman and basically manipulating her to hand over their baby. This is not the correct way to get a baby. What you did is fantastic and I applaud you for that.", "NTA. It sounds like your brother hasn't reckoned with the moral and economic realities of the adoption system. In large part, many children are available for adoption not by choice, but because their birth parents can't financially afford to care for them, which is a failure that our society hasn't chosen to resolve.\n\nYou didn't face that choice because of your affluence, and you're choosing to further use your affluence to remove that systemic issue in this one instance for this one person. You can't do it for everyone, but for this one individual you can.\n\nYou gave someone a choice where they thought they didn't have one. Your brother is learning the hard way that, when given a choice, this individual doesn't want what he's offering.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her a real choice. She chose motherhood", "NTA.\n\nBrother and SIL reduced it to a business transaction with someone they knew didn't have a lot of other options --- and in those terms the supplier got a better offer.

For a 24 year old with a 7 year old child you have a lot of money to help out someone you barely know. I have sympathy for Sara and I wish single parents had more resources to help them out. I also hope Sarah gets a restraining order against you Brother and SIL.\n\nYTA if for any reason you don't follow up. Even if you or your son have a medical emergency that drains your savings you owe it to Sarah to give her the money you promised and to not rush her on repayments. Even if Sarah behaves in a way you don't approve of (drugs, boyfriend, school drop out), you owe her that money.\n\nSarah is making a life changing decision because of a promise you are making.

Ignore them. \n\nYou're giving a mother and child a chance to stay together and it's going to mean the world to them.

That kid is going to grow up knowing who his real mom is, his mom has a chance to give her son the best possible life with her, and they're going to have a future together. \n\nI'm so glad that there's amazing people like you out there. I work in a field where I see a lot of bad shit, and this post made me so happy to hear some good out there. I teared up a bit there.\n\nKeep being your beautiful self, ignore your brother and his wife and don't let their negativity get to you. What you did is wonderful.", "NTA\n\nYou helped a young mother to be. It would have always be difficult. For the woman as well as for your brother if the woman might have been in the picture. Yes it is bad for your brother and his wife. Because they really were invested. Don't know if this would be possible, but if they can see the point of the young mother and why she loves her child and don't want to give it away, maybe your brother could offer to be god parents? Like yeah they also have build a bond with the child so maybe it would be a way (if they can seperate from 'this would have be our child' to 'it is great, that the child is happy').\n\nIs it possible in your country to get a surrogate mother? Or can they go to a place where it is allowed? Before the war this was a possible in the Ukrain (and I think it still is, but who know). Woman rent out their womb for a couple to get a child. They even can use their own eggs and or sperm or some of a sperm/egg bank. And those woman - even if it is still a question if it is okay to take advantage of such person, who need the money and sell their body - know what they are in for. They shouldn't form a bond with the child. Could be a better way to get a child and be involved in all the appointments.", "NTA\n\nyour brother and his wife are literally preying on underprivileged women. if they have the money (and, probably, the connections), why don't they just go through the regular process of adoption? smh. they should be ashamed of themselves. they can't use their money to buy people.", "NTA bless your soul and wish nothing but peace for both of you and child.", "Nta she didn't want to give up her baby", "NTA.

Are you going to pay for every child that your brother is thinking about adopting? Your family's wealth will run out at some point.", "My parents are also extremely pissed. Not sure what family Easter is gonna be like this year -\\_\\_-", "Many of those agencies do exactly this and are extreeeeemely predatory in the exact same way", "Like predators", "The part that stood out to me was that \u201cafter several meet ups, Sarah agreed\u2026\u201d. They obviously had been working on her and strong arming her. It sounds like they basically wore her down during an incredibly stressful (mentally and physically) time. They probably misrepresented themselves as someone helping the poor mom out of hte goodness of their heart, and then waited until she felt obligated to them.", "For real, I can't get over how straight-up dastardly their actions were. You can't tell me SIL found that girl's post by accident.", "Yeah, basically taking advantage of Sarah's lack of options.\n\nOP is a good person. \n\nNTA", "This", "International adoption is not better... Some families get told the kid is placed temporarily at the orphanage so the parents can go work. They come back the kid has been adopted amd left the country....", "Why \"domestic\"? It's not less predatory internationally, poor mothers in all countries love their babies.", "More like a shakedown. I hope those two never have a baby to ruin.", "It's a blury thin line.\n\nPerhaps they have their hearts in the right place,  but are mystified at the agencies (both domestic and overseas) and their drama.\n\nOP,  NTA.", "I have to admit it bothered me from the start. But I wouldn't have offered if Sarah hadn't told me she was upset.", "But an agency would make them at least pretend to act ethically", "I hate that you're probably right about next time.", "I didn't ask their reasoning for the pregnancy vs born baby thing. I know that they were very excited to o to all the appointments, and SIL asked me a lot of questions about what my ultrasound appointments were like.", "Absolutely NTA but your brother and his wife are awful. They're seeking out and preying on vulnerable women, coercing them into selling their babies, it's utterly disgusting.", "Nobody seems to have done it until you did. I'm sure it won't be easy for him in the future.", "I agree with you. I am signing an agreement to that effect later this week so the money will get to her in any circumstances, like even if I die.", "Could we maybe not advocate the 'renting' of a underprivileged woman's womb as if it is like buying milk from the grocery store?", "I think surrogacy is legal in the US, but not paid surrogacy if that makes sense.", "I appreciate your balanced perspective. Thank you for commenting.", "Wow, thank you. That is the perspective that I care the most about (at least when it comes to internet strangers). My mother has been repeatedly telling me I stole a wealthy future from the child on top of stealing the child from my brother.", "So sorry you were in that position. I see it a lot at work. I hope you can have a better experience in the future", "The trauma caused to the child by adoption is so often discounted. So many people think that a child raised by rich people is automatically better off than being raised by a poor single mom but that isn't true. Being cut off from your biology, having no genetic mirrors, always feeling a little bit out of place, struggling with feeling unwanted - adoption is always traumatic. Adoptees have a very high suicide rate for this reason. Not to mention how predatory people like this are to the birth mother. They are essentially trying to buy a human. It's fucked up.", "I don\u2019t think so. \n\nThey didn\u2019t even go through an actual adoption. They literally shopped for a vulnerable woman and solicited her unborn baby from her. How macabre. \n\nBrother and SIL have issues. If the birth mom wants to give the baby for adoption, this isn\u2019t the way. She wasn\u2019t looking for it. They convinced her to do it.", "That's a big reason why I offered the vocational training. She does have a large family and plenty of friends, but I am the only friend capable of this level of financial support. Hopefully we'll continue being friends, but if not I still want her to have the training so she'll have career options.", "It's okay to betray someone to prevent them from causing an incredible amount of harm to someone vulnerable.", "we became pretty close friends over the months we were meeting. But yes, I know it was a huge betrayal, I just am not sure it was wrong despite that fact.", "Does it matter?   It\u2019s probably inheritance or trust fund money. OP seems to come from a lot of wealth.  \nThis is buying a baby.  A poor 19 year old can\u2019t afford a baby she desperately wants and the 1% can keep her poor and buy her baby because of financial problems!!", "Not gonna lie, it's almost exclusively from the money my parents gave me when I moved out. I do work a full time job but the salary is almost nothing compared to my investment income each year.", "Full disclosure, I work at a nonprofit adjacent to child and family social work, so I see this stuff a lot. Those resources are very limited and Sarah would probably not have qualified for most of them.\n\nI accept the judgement that I should have spoken to them first. That's what I feel was the most cowardly/unkind choice I made in this situation.", "I have a strong feeling they won't tell me about the next adoption until it's complete.", "Maybe your family Easter should be with Sarah\u2026", "I'm guessing they won't recommended you counsel the next one, either. NTA", "Fuck them. Adoption is hard enough when you genuinely don't want to raise your baby; I can't imagine how much harder it is when finances are the only thing stopping you. Just like with foster care, reunification is always the goal - you just saw where you could legitimately help someone rather than taking advantage of their age and financial status. \n\nIf your parents and brother/SIL don't understand that, they are the problem, not you.", "You did nothing wrong. Have fun XD", "I\u2019m guessing your brother/SIL sort of forced the adoption process on her? \n\nWho goes to someone looking for prenatal vitamins and is like \u2018Give us your baby\u2019 or was it done through an actual adoption agency.", "I think you did the right thing in helping her realize what she realiy wanted. Tread carefully though with all this money changing hands. Not even in the sense that I think she's playing you or anything like that, but just in the sense how money has a habit of complicating relationships.", "If I were you I hope those real estate holdings and everything they\u2019ve given you is in your name and that you don\u2019t expect anymore..like you\u2019re being written out of that will", "Pissed at you??", "Celebrating Easter implies that your parents are some flavor of practicing Christian and it's wild to me that they think that this behavior from your brother and SIL is acceptable. Nobody is owed a baby. Babies are owed loving and safe homes. If the bio parent(s) can provide that then that should be what everyone is working towards. You giving her the money to be able to keep her child is the most ethical (and Christian) approach.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia\\_Tann", "And she took their money \u2026like a con artist", "Definitely not an accident. Adoption is very common in high-wealth circles like my family's, and seeking out facebook posts or even responses to job listings is very common for people who don't want the long wait of going through an agency.", "They were trying to do something AWFUL.\n\nThey are plenty women that WANT to give up their child, why go after someone who does\u00b4t and coerce her into giving up her child???????\n\nNTA BUT OP, is that girl conventionnally attractive? Does she kinda look like SIL? Is there any reason you can think of for why they targeted her for this? Or were they just going out of their way to act vile and digusting ?", "W\u2026 what?!? Really? Oof I didn\u2019t know that. What a vile thing to do", "You're a good person, OP. Thanks for watching out for someone who needed it.", "But in the bigger picture of things - there are plenty moms around the world, who could have kept their kids, had they had the money. That\u2019s why we even have adoption agencies\u2026 you did the right thing for Sarah, she will be forever grateful, but neither of us are going to save them all.", "So you can keep offering to fund pregnant teens?", "So the experience of the pregnancy is a key part of it for them.", "Honestly, if that's how you see it, I'll just point out that that appears to be the basis of most adoptions. They're common in our social circle and I've seen similar stories through agencies and through foster :/", "You sound like a good person, I hope you and Sarah can see this through to the end.\n\nSadly though, wills get contested all the damn time. Sarah would need a lawyer to help her through of legal battles. I really hope it doesn't come to that.", "Thank you", "I think it depends on the state.", "Yes, it make sense", "There are thing more important than wealth. A maternal bond is one of them.", "There are pros and cons to both sides. But nothing compares to not being able to eat regularly if they are as poor as OP says. We are talking about basic necessities. This young lady is 19. Where's her stability to raise a child. I know we want to rely on family to help but at the same time they aren't required to", "That may be true but look at it this way. If bro and SIL didn't get involved with her then the young lady would have been another statistic. Another teenage single mother that would be on assistance with no guidance.", "Well I hope for her sake she takes you up on your offer. But as you know nothing trains you better than actually having the baby and taking care of it", "He didn\u2019t even try to talk to them. They weren\u2019t forcing her to do anything. I disagree and you are grossly painting the brother and SIL as some kind of negligent monsters forcing this woman into giving up a baby when there is nothing here that implies that.", "NTA she was targeted because she was poor. She would have regretted the decision to give up her child for the rest of her life. \n\nYour brother and his wife sound like spoiled rich assholes where ad you are kind and generous. If they really want to adopt then tell them to go through an adoption agency instead of hunting poor women online", "Do you think your brother is a good person? How about your sister in law?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you go to them and tell them you were certain this woman wanted to keep her baby? \n\nIt\u2019s really creepy that you did all of this behind their back, especially funding her \u201cescape.\u201d\n\nSeems like people here agree with you and that\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t and think it\u2019s a betrayal. Hopefully you and your brother/SIL find some kind of peace here because I can say as someone with a tricky brother relationship and also as someone who struggled with fertility issues, I would be furious beyond belief.", "It matters if OP can't follow up on her promise. If she's paycheck to paycheck this is probably not wise. \n\nSarah is parenting this baby because of OPs promise. If OP doesn't follow through she's as fucked up as someone who protests outside of an abortion clinic. In both cases a young woman is taking on the responsibilities of raising a child from the encouragement of someone who can talk the talk but won't have to walk the walk.\n\nIf OP does keep it up she's a great person.", "It\u2019s gonna be funny if your parents have a way to revoke that real estate transaction", "YTA.", "She doesn't celebrate Christian holidays, but I do see your point.", "I appreciate this. She was deeply uncomfortable accepting the money at all, so I do have some worries about if she'll feel too weird being friends after this. You're very right that me having a weird \"charity\" mindset or her feeling patronized would harm our relationship.", "Yes :( it makes sense but also ouch", "You sound like a baby thief.", "They targeted her because she was poor and they knew they could manipulate her.", "International adoption have been compared to child trafficking more then once....", "More like I've lost a lot of trust in my brother's ability to handle this with grace. I wish I could be there next time to emotionally support the mother of their next attempted adoption, but I know it's not going to happen.", "I guess. They have a lot of grief and devastation over the infertility, so I can see why it would matter to them", "But they didn't find Sarah through a foster/adoption agency right? You said they found her on a group where she was trying to get prenatal vitamins? So it sounds like they were taking a shortcut and looking for poor, young pregnant women that they could throw money at for their baby instead of going through an adoption agency which would connect them with women that have already decided to give up their baby. Please correct me if I'm wrong.", "That is the basis of most infant adoptions, you're right. All of it is incredibly unethical and focused entirely on the needs of the adoptive parents, with the actual child being an afterthought.", "It essentially is, its sad. Those \"adoption agencies\" are extremely predatory and do target the poor. There was a few stories where the lawyers in said agencies would talk about how the adoptive family would sue them if they back out halfway. Them being poor means they essentially can't fight it at all and with their consulting lawyer being paid by the adoptive family they can't get any good advice either.\n\nIt takes a different kind of strength to go against family for the sake of another. Respect.", "I'll do whatever I can to avoid that, including trying not to die for at least 50 more years :)", ">would have been another statistic\n\nMaybe. But that\u2019s not really your point, is it?  \n\nYou asked if OP was making the best decision for the child. The fact is, OP offered her a lifeline BUT she wasn\u2019t looking to adopt out her baby. And now she has the option of not giving her baby away and she chose it. OP didn\u2019t choose this for them. \n\nI struggle to see brother and SIL in an altruistic way for this behavior; if they wanted to adopt ethically, why didn\u2019t they do so legally instead of a back-alley bribe on a teenager?", "Agreed. Thank you for taking the time to comment", "I could and maybe should have talked to them beforehand. But I'm certain that knowing she wanted to keep her baby would not have changed their decision. I apologize that you've dealt with the same issues.", "They don't :) thanks for the concern", "why?  because she shared her windfall with someone in need?  her siblings were being predatory.  NTA.", "Not arguing with you, but I'm genuinely curious why that question affected your judgement.", "How does that affect anything?", "It. Really. Doesnt.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iuzap/aita_for_screwing_up_my_brothers_adoption_on/j5gy3cb?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "Yeah but why not an agency? Why go through manipulate someone when they are well off enough not to need to?", "They need therapy, not a baby. A baby purchased from a poor teenager is just a bandaid and can turn out very badly for everyone--especially the most important person in the triad, the child.", "Yes. I just mean other adoptions I've witnessed have made me equally uncomfortable. One family friend adopted through an agency with the promise of making it an open adoption and then went back on that promise the moment the baby was signed over.\n\nI'm definitely overly sensitive on this issue because of my history. That's a big reason why I wasn't sure my judgement on helping her was sound.", "OP did offer help. The way I look at it is the young lady saw OP as a success story and that's what pushed her to keep the child in my opinion. \n\nAs for why the bro and SIL chose the route they did...I can only speculate. Maybe they wanted to meet the mother's beforehand to get the jist on what the child will be like. Maybe it's cheaper. Maybe they want to help out a struggling teen. Maybe they feel she doesn't deserve it.", "Good luck man", "Because unless she's willing to pay for that kid for the next 18 years, she's setting this mom up to fail.", "Ignore this clown. You ARE providing for the kids future by helping the mom out with getting into a higher education. \n\nI don't know why they're so bitter, but that's on them. If there were more people out there like you the world would be a much better place. \u2764", "Are you planning on supporting her and the kid for the next 18 years with someone else's money? Or are you using money that was given to you for a specific purpose to put another woman into a bad future position?", "Adoption agencies are not much different than preying on a girl to buy her baby. But in that case the agency gets the money instead. \n\nIf you haven't read The Child Catchers, or anything about Georgia Tann, you really should. It is a billion dollar for-profit scam.", "She mentioned helping the mom access vocational training. Did you not read the post?", "I'm hoping the training I offered will put her in a position that she won't need support. But yes, if she needed more support in the future I would be happy to talk about it. She seems deeply uncomfortable with the money I'm offering her already though, so I doubt it.", "Clearly he didn\u2019t read lol", "And? Does that immediately/always translate into being self-sufficient, let alone able to support a second person?", "Vocational training is really, really hard for a single parent (finding childcare, sleepness nights...). Hopefully OP will still keep up her end of the deal if Sarah drops out or reduces class load.", "You also had a support system, she does not. Do you know how she did in school because of it was t good she may drop out. Are you paying all costs included in day care also?  \n\nMaybe you e thought this through, I don\u2019t know. I do not believe anyone should give up a baby if they can cover at least basic needs. \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you suggest open adoption though?", "I have witnessed an open adoption conducted by a family friend that they instantly closed once the baby was signed over. Which was my first discovery that open adoptions are not legally enforceable.\n\nLuckily she does have a support system, just not financial resources. Her family does not want her living with them with a baby, which is why she needed rent, but they are willing to help with childcare and such.", "In order to understand, really not trying to give you a hard time as it is a complex issue, are you prepared to pay all expenses for this child through college?\n\nBecause at some point it\u2019s gotta be about the child\u2019s best interest as well. \n\nAgain no right or wrong here, I just want to make sure you\u2019ve really thought everything out.", "Do you know anyone that was adopted? How much therapy is needed for these children, even when they are brought into a \u2018good\u2019 home? Do you really think separating a baby from a birth mother who clearly wants her child is in the best interest of the child?  The young woman had every intention of keeping her child until these people convinced her otherwise. They preyed on her when she was looking for help getting prenatal vitamins. That\u2019s wrong on so many levels. They do not sound like good people. Just because they have money, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re the best option for the baby. This woman had support, just not immediate financial support, and OP is helping her be able to have long term financial support by providing education."]}
