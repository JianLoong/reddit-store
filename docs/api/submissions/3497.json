I think the marriage is a terrible idea for several reasons, including the fact that their \u201crelationship\u201d started before he was 18 and while she was still married so I feel like this whole situation reeks of grooming and instability but who knows she could just be reaallyyyyy immature for her age or something and I\u2019m just being super judgy. \n\nI know that this wedding will happen whether we want it to or not so I am trying to be civilly supportive so he doesn\u2019t get isolated in a relationship to have it turn sour and not have anyone to turn to. I volunteered to go suit shopping with my brother and offered to help the fiance with decorations but she said her mom had it covered. \n\nMy brother put us all (my brother, his fianc\u00e9, my sister, me and my husband) in a group chat to talk about the wedding plans. It is a very small wedding with about 12 people going. They decided to have a potluck. \n\nIn the group chat, we had tentatively agreed on who would bring what when the fianc\u00e9 added her mom to the group chat who then changed the plan and asked us to bring other stuff. My sister and I again each picked a dish to bring. The mom then asked us to bring two dishes each since the budget is tight and they want to make sure everyone gets food. \n\nThe thing is, I really don\u2019t want to. I feel like if they can\u2019t afford to bring food to their own wedding then they can\u2019t afford to get married. I feel like it\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019ve offered and everything we\u2019ve thought of has been shot down. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m blinded my dislike for the situation and I\u2019m being an asshole for not bringing two dishes or if they really are being unreasonable.

It\u2019s just 12 people. That\u2019s not a huge crowd - you don\u2019t need a ton of different dishes. Soon-to-be MIL can bring three if she\u2019s worried. You\u2019ve signed up for your part.", "NTA so long as you let the bride's mother know you're sticking to the original plan and will bringing one dish to the potluck. If she knows, she can adjust her plans.", "In the words of Miss Manners, if you can\u2019t afford to serve wine, serve punch. If you can\u2019t afford to serve punch, serve water. Whatever you serve, do it graciously. \n\nGuests should not be under any obligation to provide food.  NTA.", "NTA. You only agreed to bring one dish. You aren\u2019t obligated to do more than you originally agreed to. If the MOB is worried that there won\u2019t be enough food, she should be the one who brings more dishes.", "NTA - My best friend got married in a backyard ceremony with an exceptionally tight budget. He served $50 worth of pizza, chips, and soda to the 15 people there. It wasn't the most elegant wedding food in the world, but it was food that didn't require the guests to pitch in. \n\nUnrelated to my judgment - Pot Lucks are a pan in the butt to organize. If you don't spend half your time micromanaging your guests, at least 5 people are going to show up with 1 bag of chips each, and 2 people are going to show up with bags of ice. I've done my fair share of Pot Lucks to know that it always turns out badly.", "NTA as it\u2019s not on the guests to bring food to a wedding and especially not multiple dishes, but it seems like the issue is more with your distaste of their relationship.", "NTA if this is real, the whole situation is f'ed up. What's the statute of limitations on statutory rape in your state? Why would her mom be so gung-ho on this wedding, especially if it's already her 2nd? If they can't afford food for 12 people, how will they support themselves? You aren't obligated to bring any food to a wedding, so it's nice that you even offered to bring one dish.", "I can see being frustrated for more than a few reasons. But in for a penny in for a pound, as they say. A second dish is nothing. You\u2019re NTA either way though.", "NTA.  Your instincts are sound.  This couple seems to need a lot of help already, and it's not a good look.  It's one thing to participate in a potluck dinner.  It's another thing to be burdened with the bride's mom's demand that you bring more.  If there's 12 people and each one brings a dish that feeds 3-4 people, that ought to be enough.\n\nI'm okay with potluck dinners UNLESS the host demands that I feed everyone or cater to his or her tastes.", "We had a potluck reception. Second marriage for both of us, very casual. But we did NO micromanaging, just asked people to bring a dish to share. It worked out great!", "NTA if you confirm with the MIL ahead of time that you will only be bringing one dish, 12 servings.  That is what you originally committed to, and it should be sufficient if others are also contributing to the meal.\n\nYour plan to stay close with your brother is a good one!", "NTA - You aren\u2019t obligated to bring any food.  It\u2019s kind of you to bring anything at all.\n\nThis is a small backyard wedding for only a dozen people.  If they can\u2019t afford to feed a dozen people then they aren\u2019t ready for a \u201cwedding\u201d.  They\u2019re only ready for a marriage at city hall.  I\u2019m right there with you in being incredulous.", "NTA. You all had an agreement to bring one dish. Her mother came in and tried to dictate things and change it. How much food do 12 people need?", "NTA and all that needs to be said is 'I'm sorry, no. I wilil only be able to bring one dish'.\n\nLeaving aside concerns about the marriage itself, I have no particular objection to a potluck if everyone is on board.  It works for some.\n\nBut if the couple or the MOB have concerns about there not being enough food for everyone, then it is on *them* to bring the extra dishes, not you.", "NTA but what is the point of you telling your opinion about the marriage?  If you would bring more if you \u201capproved\u201d that\u2019s kinda AH thing to say.  I\u2019ve been to potluck weddings.  It has been quite common in the past.  People don\u2019t actually have to have a big wedding and serve you.", "YTA your opinion on their marriage seems to be reflected in your decision. If it's money then tell them you'll bring what you can afford. But if your disapproval is the reason yeah sorry YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Boom.  Problem solved. \n\nNTA.", "I think one dish is more than generous. Can always just grab a few things from a grocery store. Store bought goodies. Actually saw someone load up on cakes at a warehouse that she uses in her catering business. And they have chicken salad and loads of party foods that can be used. Vegetable platter. I doubt I would want to go homemade if I felt such disdain for the bride.", "I am going to reserve judgement bc I see both sides. On one hand I do think y9u just don't like the whole situation and don't want to deal, on the other I can see where you're coming from and its not unreasonable. \n\nWith that being said, I have seen more and more people opting for things like small pot luck weddings. It does have to do somewhat with Financials, but also has to do with people realizing that a wedding is not what's important to spend money on. You are being asked to bring a couple of dishes to a pot luck. If this was a different family event, would you say no because there are people there you don't like? \n\nIf you go bring the dishes, buy them ifnyou don't want to make them. Ifnyou don't want to bring the dishes and are truly against this marriage don't go, but expect there to be damage to your relationship with your brother. You said you were sucking it up and being there for him because you want to be there for him in the future if/when things go bad. That's wonderful, but part of doing that would include sucking it up and bringing the dishes regardless of how you feel about a pot luck wedding", "NTA - you agreed to bring one dish. Just be crystal clear in the group chat that you are bringing only one dish, and what that dish is. \n\nIf pushed, tell them your budget doesn't extend to the provision of two dishes.\n\nBest of luck, it sounds as though you might need it", "ESH, yes it sounds like your judgemental attitude is absolutely clouding the whole thing.", "The rule at pot lucks is bring enough food for one person. If everyone does that then there's a meal for everyone.\n\nMost people usually bring more. So asking them to bring 2 dishes each is over-catering.", "^^^ This! If you can't afford to serve water, don't have a wedding. Get married at the courthouse, go out to dinner afterwards with the parents.", "It is a pot luck reception. Guest at a pot luck are actually obligated to bring food or not eat.", "We had a backyard BBQ at my wedding. It seems a bit stingy to ask guests to provide their own food.", "It\u2019s a potluck wedding. It\u2019s a thing. And yes, just like any other potluck, the guests do need to bring food.", ">Why would her mom be so gung-ho on this wedding, especially if it's already her 2nd?\n\nI have a feeling that the answer is an unannounced pregnancy", "Enough to fill the newly weds\u2019 fridge and freezer for a few weeks? Doesn\u2019t sounds like they can afford to feed themselves, TBH.", "Oops! I\u2019ve always brought enough to feed like 10.", "That's what I thought. \n\nI always imagine I'm stuck with only my own meal, and make sure that would be enough. Then add a little bit more. (Of vourse, if you bring kids, you bring enough food for you and your kids)", "They are not, however, obligated to bring two dishes.", "Ugh! If it is, your brother should get a paternity test, because she sounds like a hot mess. Also, if the age of consent in your state is 18, and the conception proves that she slept with him before he was 18, she can be charged as a sex offender.", "The way I do it is to make enough to ensure everyone can have a portion if they want it, and a bit extra. 10 people? 13 roasted chicken thighs with chopped potato and onion in the same pan, as an example. Or i bring a large lasagna tray of whatever (casserole, pasta salad). I'm personally annoyed if a food option is gone before I've had a chance to get any. There are always people who take more than their fair share.", "Ha ha! I know- most people bring at least enough to feed 4. That's why there are always left overs at potlucks.", "A lot of states have Romeo and Juliette laws. So a 17 year old can date a 21 year old etc.", "This us true. Guilty as charged."]}
