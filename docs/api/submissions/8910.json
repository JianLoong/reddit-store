Every other month, my grandmother hosts a large family dinner with all my close relatives. She encouraged me to invite my girlfriend over for the dinner yesterday. For some context, my entire family and I are black, and my girlfriend is from a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant family.\n\nI was at the dinner yesterday, and I went to go hang out with my niece, (F7) who I'm very fond of, and the rest of the kids to play Monopoly. My girlfriend tagged along.\n\nMy niece was counting the play money to pass out to everyone, and one of the other kids said something about how he wanted to be rich and get all the 500 dollar bills. My niece, out of nowhere, blurted out that she couldn't be rich because she's an n-word. I was totally taken aback, and asked her who told her that. Apparently, some bully at school said that to her on career day when they were sharing dream jobs, and she said she wanted to be a rich president.\n\nI told her that that wasn't true at all, and hugged her, and she started crying. Then, my girlfriend jumped in, and told my niece that it's really important to forgive the boy who said that because he probably wasn't trying to be mean and was just confused. I was totally shocked, and told her she needs to stop trying to justify what happened. \n\nShe then tried to hush me, and started baby-talking my niece and said that she should also try to be nicer to all the kids at school, because \"kindness goes both ways.\" I was totally livid at this point, and pulled my girlfriend aside and quietly but angrily told her she \"needs to learn when to shut the fuck up.\" She started getting riled up at me and started rambling about how statistics are on her side (idk what the hell she meant, I wasn't really processing what she was saying,) but I told her to get out of my grandma's home, and just leave already (she drove me here in her car, and I was planning to hitch a ride home with my brother.)\n\nThis morning, I got multiple calls from my girlfriend's sisters calling me an abusive and shitty prick. I know my words were harsh, but I thought my girlfriend was talking in a disgusting manner to my niece.

I mean, it would have been cool if she could have encouraged your niece, told her that boy doesn't know anything, and she CAN be anything she sets her mind to.
