Every other month, my grandmother hosts a large family dinner with all my close relatives. She encouraged me to invite my girlfriend over for the dinner yesterday. For some context, my entire family and I are black, and my girlfriend is from a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant family.\n\nI was at the dinner yesterday, and I went to go hang out with my niece, (F7) who I'm very fond of, and the rest of the kids to play Monopoly. My girlfriend tagged along.\n\nMy niece was counting the play money to pass out to everyone, and one of the other kids said something about how he wanted to be rich and get all the 500 dollar bills. My niece, out of nowhere, blurted out that she couldn't be rich because she's an n-word. I was totally taken aback, and asked her who told her that. Apparently, some bully at school said that to her on career day when they were sharing dream jobs, and she said she wanted to be a rich president.\n\nI told her that that wasn't true at all, and hugged her, and she started crying. Then, my girlfriend jumped in, and told my niece that it's really important to forgive the boy who said that because he probably wasn't trying to be mean and was just confused. I was totally shocked, and told her she needs to stop trying to justify what happened. \n\nShe then tried to hush me, and started baby-talking my niece and said that she should also try to be nicer to all the kids at school, because \"kindness goes both ways.\" I was totally livid at this point, and pulled my girlfriend aside and quietly but angrily told her she \"needs to learn when to shut the fuck up.\" She started getting riled up at me and started rambling about how statistics are on her side (idk what the hell she meant, I wasn't really processing what she was saying,) but I told her to get out of my grandma's home, and just leave already (she drove me here in her car, and I was planning to hitch a ride home with my brother.)\n\nThis morning, I got multiple calls from my girlfriend's sisters calling me an abusive and shitty prick. I know my words were harsh, but I thought my girlfriend was talking in a disgusting manner to my niece.

Makes me wonder what she has done in her past to want this empathy", ">Then, my girlfriend jumped in, and told my niece that it's really important to forgive the boy who said that because he probably wasn't trying to be mean and was just confused.\n\nYour girlfriends one of those bleeding hearts from this forum I swear. \"Sure the person did something horrible to you, but you need to *forgive them for yourself\\~ They're just misunderstood! Oh, I hope no one ever judges you harshly for one single act toooooo\\~\"*\n\n>She then tried to hush me, and started baby-talking my niece and said that she should also try to be nicer to all the kids at school, because \"kindness goes both ways.\"\n\nI'm white as bread, but sincerely I'd have dumped her at the \"hushing\" part because that's exceedingly rude and to then condescendingly dump that spiel on your niece like she's a teacher forcing the victim to reconcile with their abuser is vomit inducing.\n\n>She started getting riled up at me and started rambling about how statistics are on her side\n\nShe needs to be nicer, because kindness goes both ways.\n\n>This morning, I got multiple calls from my girlfriend's sisters calling me an abusive and shitty prick. I know my words were harsh, but I thought my girlfriend was talking in a disgusting manner to my niece. \n\nShe was, and she's also a coward.

I initially thought I was going to judge you TA because of the title and I'm glad I read everything through. \n\nI'm sorry your niece had to be told that awful lie and she doesn't owe her bully anything, let alone forgiveness. It's kind of a new trend of toxic positivity and it's an enabling behavior that people sometimes exhibit to make things all \"nice and happy\" when someone has done something awful to another. The victim of the bully is expected to instantly forgive even though the bully isn't even really sorry. \n\nYour GF could've said any number of things that would've been far more compassionate towards your niece. She could've told her that the bully was completely wrong and that she can be whatever she wants to be. \n\nDoes GF have trouble reading the room? What she said was incredibly insensitive and clueless.", "NTA. Your words were harsh but what she did was inexcusable.

Your gf is racist by ignorance.  She doesn't sound malicious.  But ignorant racism is still racism.  If you continue dating her, you're going to have to turn her into a charity project to educate her and that honestly sounds exhausting.  She certainly shouldn't be around your young family members where she could possibly do some bad psychological damage.  If I were in your shoes, I would not continue the relationship.  Good for you for standing up for that little one.", "NTA.\n\nI think, maybe, I understand the point your GF may have been trying to make, but boy was she wrong! Even if that boy had told your niece she couldn\u2019t be President and get rich because she\u2019s a girl (I heard that as a kid in the 60s), it would have been wrong. VERY wrong. It\u2019s made even worse by the racism involved. Your GF is really dense and very stubborn. Even if she really didn\u2019t understand what was happening, the moment you told her to be quiet, given that she was a guest, she should have shut up tight. Then talked about it in private with you later. \n\nDepending on the age of the boy who said that to your niece, he might have just been parroting garbage heard at home\u2026..or not. Again, it depends on his age to determine how big of a jerk he was. If he was 6 my feelings would be different than if he was 12, for example. Definitely, the school should be made aware, especially if you have a name.\n\nYour GF clearly has no comprehension of racism or of any prejudice. She sounds very, very naive.  I don\u2019t understand how she couldn\u2019t at least have an idea as to why she was wrong! Sadly, I know people who are that blind. True, going ballistic on the boy would have backfired, but love and roses isn\u2019t going to work, either. It needs to be dealt with VERY FIRMLY, and he needs to be educated as to why he\u2019s wrong. I say that because he\u2019s a child. It would be very, very different if an adult told that to your niece. Block the phone numbers of your GF sisters. If you think it\u2019s possible to educate your GF (please don\u2019t be condescending as that will close her ears) then try to talk with her. You know her history and personality, none of us here do. \n\nMeanwhile, I hope your niece will come to understand that her worth is invaluable and her dreams are really only limited by her determination. I truly hope that by the time she\u2019s old enough to be a President, nobody will think twice about it, whether she becomes President of the United States or President of her own corporation!

But could you please give us an update?\n\nAlso I think I speak for everyone when I say. Please tell your niece to reach for the stars and to never give up on her dreams.", "Don\u2019t do it in person. She may try to act like assaulted her. Tell her via text message, send screen shots to her Klan family members and tell them to NEVER CONTACT YOU AGAIN OR YOU\u2019RE FILING A POLICE REPORT FOR HARASSMENT, and act like she\u2019s made her way to hell.", "The second he said she came into a Black household I dreaded where it was going.", "It's still not a good thing to say to your girlfriend. But, to your ex? Very appropriate. OP needs to fix that.", "Tbh when there is a problematic-sounding title on AITA, it often ends up that the OP is NTA; it's the posts with innocent-sounding titles that are written by AHs.", "OR because she wants a 'cute mixed' baby. My JNSIL said shit like that about me and my husband.", "Explain to your niece that her behavior is WHY you broke up with her. Let her know that if a friend or romantic interest has a attitude or world view that she doesn't like, she doesn't have to stay with them.\n\nGood standards for who you hang out with include the fact that \"nobody at all\" will never be your last choice.", "Nothing low-key about her racism. Pretty much plain as potatoes.", "I wouldn\u2019t waste the energy to explain anything. She is already showing she is a gaslighter and claiming he is abusive. She will continue to play the victim. It\u2019s not our job to educate and reform racists. He should just get away.\n\nEdit: by \u201cour\u201d I mean Black people", "Right? \n\nShe has a lot of audacity speaking over OP about this issue, and then piling a 2nd helping of racism onto a 7 year old girl. Then to come back with the statistic comment for dessert. That girl is NOT IT. As a white woman dating a black man, she should have some empathy and understanding, and she had less than none. She thought she knew better. How freaking embarrassing. I feel badly for OP. He just found out who she was. \n\nYou deserve better, OP.", "It's super common for them to do turn on the tears in arguments with Black women too.", "Also her disconnect. So this racist boy needs to be forgiven but her bf is being \"abusive\"? What? I guess with that logic my doctor is trying to kill me, and the Coke company cares about my health?", "The only good thing is he found out 5 months in and not years in.", "And on the first day of black history month! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "That stat is actually super helpful. 100% of all people who bring it up in an argument are closet racists.", "Watch high boi explaining it on youtube. Funny guy man", "Closet is more of denying who you are. ie she is in denial about being racist. Not that other people don't think she is and aren't calling her one.", "I voted for Obama twice and then voted for Obama again. \n\n(Not really\u2026. Voted for Clinton\u2026. Just so no dumb shit starts hollering about voter fraud) \n\nI\u2019d vote for Obama\u2026.if she runs.", "It's a double edged sword for women at some companies, if you're working for a male then wear make-up and look your best to get the acknowledgement.  If you're working for a woman, don't overdue your make-up and look a little dowdy to get the acknowledgement.  It really doesn't matter what you can accomplish or what your skills are.  \n\nAt other companies, it's the complete opposite, acknowledgement based upon your skill set and what you bring to the table.  I've worked in both environments.", "And larger breasts = lower IQ to many people in a different study awhile back", "My mother refuses to acknowledge that it exists. And of course, she can't be racist because she had a crush on a black man so many years ago in middle school and was friends with another that lived next to her. He was also a Muslim. So she also used that to deflect any xenophobia she would have. If some online predator was hitting on my sister at 7, he was automatically Muslim. After a while i just learned to ignore her because she would take any argument and insult the person until they stopped. She took hat to mean she won, obviously, but you can't get into her head to tell her that no one actually wants to talk to her about this stuff because she resorts to that."]}
