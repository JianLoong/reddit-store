Every other month, my grandmother hosts a large family dinner with all my close relatives. She encouraged me to invite my girlfriend over for the dinner yesterday. For some context, my entire family and I are black, and my girlfriend is from a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant family.\n\nI was at the dinner yesterday, and I went to go hang out with my niece, (F7) who I'm very fond of, and the rest of the kids to play Monopoly. My girlfriend tagged along.\n\nMy niece was counting the play money to pass out to everyone, and one of the other kids said something about how he wanted to be rich and get all the 500 dollar bills. My niece, out of nowhere, blurted out that she couldn't be rich because she's an n-word. I was totally taken aback, and asked her who told her that. Apparently, some bully at school said that to her on career day when they were sharing dream jobs, and she said she wanted to be a rich president.\n\nI told her that that wasn't true at all, and hugged her, and she started crying. Then, my girlfriend jumped in, and told my niece that it's really important to forgive the boy who said that because he probably wasn't trying to be mean and was just confused. I was totally shocked, and told her she needs to stop trying to justify what happened. \n\nShe then tried to hush me, and started baby-talking my niece and said that she should also try to be nicer to all the kids at school, because \"kindness goes both ways.\" I was totally livid at this point, and pulled my girlfriend aside and quietly but angrily told her she \"needs to learn when to shut the fuck up.\" She started getting riled up at me and started rambling about how statistics are on her side (idk what the hell she meant, I wasn't really processing what she was saying,) but I told her to get out of my grandma's home, and just leave already (she drove me here in her car, and I was planning to hitch a ride home with my brother.)\n\nThis morning, I got multiple calls from my girlfriend's sisters calling me an abusive and shitty prick. I know my words were harsh, but I thought my girlfriend was talking in a disgusting manner to my niece.

Youre gf (im hoping ex gf now) was being 100% dismissive and excusing racism. Its amazing you were able to be there for your niece, and stood up to your gf.

Makes me wonder what she has done in her past to want this empathy", ">Then, my girlfriend jumped in, and told my niece that it's really important to forgive the boy who said that because he probably wasn't trying to be mean and was just confused.\n\nYour girlfriends one of those bleeding hearts from this forum I swear. \"Sure the person did something horrible to you, but you need to *forgive them for yourself\\~ They're just misunderstood! Oh, I hope no one ever judges you harshly for one single act toooooo\\~\"*\n\n>She then tried to hush me, and started baby-talking my niece and said that she should also try to be nicer to all the kids at school, because \"kindness goes both ways.\"\n\nI'm white as bread, but sincerely I'd have dumped her at the \"hushing\" part because that's exceedingly rude and to then condescendingly dump that spiel on your niece like she's a teacher forcing the victim to reconcile with their abuser is vomit inducing.\n\n>She started getting riled up at me and started rambling about how statistics are on her side\n\nShe needs to be nicer, because kindness goes both ways.\n\n>This morning, I got multiple calls from my girlfriend's sisters calling me an abusive and shitty prick. I know my words were harsh, but I thought my girlfriend was talking in a disgusting manner to my niece. \n\nShe was, and she's also a coward.

It's kind of a new trend of toxic positivity and it's an enabling behavior that people sometimes exhibit to make things all \"nice and happy\" when someone has done something awful to another. The victim of the bully is expected to instantly forgive even though the bully isn't even really sorry. \n\nYour GF could've said any number of things that would've been far more compassionate towards your niece.

Even if that boy had told your niece she couldn\u2019t be President and get rich because she\u2019s a girl (I heard that as a kid in the 60s), it would have been wrong. VERY wrong. It\u2019s made even worse by the racism involved. Your GF is really dense and very stubborn. Even if she really didn\u2019t understand what was happening, the moment you told her to be quiet, given that she was a guest, she should have shut up tight. Then talked about it in private with you later. \n\nDepending on the age of the boy who said that to your niece, he might have just been parroting garbage heard at home\u2026..or not. Again, it depends on his age to determine how big of a jerk he was. If he was 6 my feelings would be different than if he was 12, for example. Definitely, the school should be made aware, especially if you have a name.\n\nYour GF clearly has no comprehension of racism or of any prejudice. She sounds very, very naive.  I don\u2019t understand how she couldn\u2019t at least have an idea as to why she was wrong! Sadly, I know people who are that blind. True, going ballistic on the boy would have backfired, but love and roses isn\u2019t going to work, either. It needs to be dealt with VERY FIRMLY, and he needs to be educated as to why he\u2019s wrong. I say that because he\u2019s a child. It would be very, very different if an adult told that to your niece. Block the phone numbers of your GF sisters. If you think it\u2019s possible to educate your GF (please don\u2019t be condescending as that will close her ears) then try to talk with her. You know her history and personality, none of us here do. \n\nMeanwhile, I hope your niece will come to understand that her worth is invaluable and her dreams are really only limited by her determination.

Any time someone assumes a kid is innocent and doesn't really mean to do harm I remember my bully's face.
