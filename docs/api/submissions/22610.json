It\u2019s caused a lot of issues in our relationship and it took him a while to finally put his foot down for our son\u2019s sake.

She\u2019s a coward, and she sold her integrity for a wedding,", "NTA and honestly your wife has shown you exactly where her loyalty lies! Her family comes first and she\u2019s so disrespectful to you and your son and your feelings! I\u2019m also confused as to why after you were thrown out of your in law\u2019s house you eventually returned!! Pay attention to the red flags and I\u2019d seriously consider divorce!!", "NTA.

I would suggest taking your son on a father son day because he doesn\u2019t need to be around those toxic people.  \n\nI would also honestly rethink this relationship. By your wife condoning their behavior by still having contact with them do you really want her around your child. Do you want your child to grow up thinking it\u2019s ok for anyone, even family, to treat him less than? Do you want your son to grow up thinking it\u2019s ok to keep the peace by letting your family treat your significant other like garbage? Because this is what your teaching him by staying with this woman.\n\nIf he is yours and your wife\u2019s child. I suggest you find yourself a damn good lawyer and file for full custody.

Take this as you will; but your wife chose the side of racists who don\u2019t want you associated with the family over you and your son.

Please remember this. \n\nYour SIL apologising for her family\u2019s horrible racist remarks is cancelled out by the fact that she has decided to not invite you or your son. She is prioritising her racist family under the disguise of \u201cwanting to keep the peace\u201d - she is no different than them in my opinion. \n\nAs for your wife, I would be extremely hurt if my partner agreed to go to a wedding that I wasn\u2019t invited to solely based on my background and my skin colour (I\u2019m a black woman), as I would see this as my partner not supporting me and instead siding with their racist family. NOW if we had a 5 year old child who was also not invited for the above reasons, I would be extremely mad and upset with my partner. \n\nTo add something else, I would go as far as to say that I wouldn\u2019t even have expected to have to explain to my partner why I don\u2019t think they should go. I would assume that it was self explanatory to not want to associate with family members who are racist towards my partner and child. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m extremely sorry that you\u2019re dealing with this and it is completely unfair on you and your child to be in this horrible situation. \n\nAs harsh as this may sound, I mean it coming from a kind place and in no way mean to be rude - I would really think about where your partner stands when it comes to her loyalties towards you and your family. \n\nI wish you the best and again, I\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019re experiencing this.", "I mean, NTA of course. But, Does it matter if she goes? She\u2019s excused and accepted her parents horrid mentality for years and doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s against you or your son. But you take a stand at someone else\u2019s event? The only difference between this racist event and the other racist events, is you won\u2019t be present to watch them be racist towards you. I\u2019m sure you love your wife but it\u2019s clear she loves her family more. You\u2019re looking for acceptance and validation from somewhere you won\u2019t find it, not even from your wife. At this point, you need to focus on your son. Children pick up on things very quickly and he needs to know he has at least one safe parent who understands the horribleness he will experience from your wife\u2019s family.", "NTA at ALL! I would be upset too. \n\nTruly, I understand how challenging it is to deal with problematic family members. Relationships are hard to navigate, and getting to a point where you can cut them off is a painful and complicated process. \n\nHowever, there is no excuse for your wife (and her sister) to continue to appease her family at the expense of you and your son. \n\nYour son does not deserve to grow up thinking that he is tainted for looking different. You don\u2019t deserve this either.

I think this is just a crappy situation. I totally understand you're hurt by the situation, I would be too. I just think she wants to be there for her sister like she was certainly always there for her. The fact they both grew up to (luckily) be two very different people from their parents makes me think they've always supported each others in the madness of that crazy household. Their dad sounds insane and it wasn't probably always fun.\n\nThat would be the ideal moment to make a statement but I also think she's afraid that would make her a bad sister not to go. Just a crappy situation overall.\n\nAlso I don't think that would be a good idea to put your son through this, he's better far way from those people.", "YTA for marrying into a racist family and being mad your wife doesn\u2019t want to completely cut ties with them.

I think you should support your wife doing that.", "YTA. Your sister-in-law has been nothing but nice to you. She has to walk a fine line here so give her some slack. Your wife will go, suck it up and her support her sister. Have to like it but you should understand that she wants to be there for her sister. Remember the sister doesn't object to your marriage or is racist. She can't make everyone happy in this instance if she says sure you come with your son then she probably loses any financial support which sucks and it's a crappy position to be in.

My wife is black and I'm white.  Her family was pretty accepting of me.  When I told my mom I was with a black woman she was worried.  Not because she's racist but because she was worried about the backlash we'd get from other people.  She loves my wife to death and adores our kids, and constantly spoils them both like a grandma should.  Most of mom's side loves her as well.  My dad's side (Most of them) wouldn't approve and I've been pretty much no contact with them since we got together.  When anyone would ask if my family had any issues with our relationship my default answer was \"Not the ones that matter.\"  \n\nThe real AH here is your FIL.  Your SIL is just wanting to keep the peace, and your wife wants to be there to support her sister.  Let her.

You are NTA, and your wife should stay home with you and your son. Her family\u2019s beliefs should be a good enough reason for your wife to go low contact with them moving forward.", "NTA. I feel for you and your wife in this situation I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Totally understandable that you want her to stand her ground and tell the world you\u2019re a family and they can\u2019t have just her, they either accept all of you or get none of you. And I get why she wants to be there for her sister, it\u2019s really hard to cut off family. Ultimately I wouldn\u2019t want to support my sister if she wasn\u2019t willing to stand her ground and welcome my whole family.

Including her actions.", "Your wife going to the wedding is disrespectful & it's allowing her father to continue to verbally abuse & dislike you.

I would have a long talk with my wife how this situation makes you feel and how you think I affects the child of you BOTH.\n\nYou three matter the most, then everybody else is coming. Therefore I would tell her that you expect her to prioritise this family above SIL and the racist parents.\n\nI assume it will be hard for her to stand up against her parents and possibly indirect against her SIL. But she has to do it to do it for the sake of your marriage and your child.\n\nYou both may need to take some time to discuss this properly and without unnecessary escalation - she will probably need some time to process it. I would not force this process to be done with the wedding of SIL, because she may need more time.\n\nNevertheless - if she does not stand up in the end for you and your child, she does not deserve both of you. It is important that she understands it.", "NTA. This reminds me of friend I had in college who were married. She was white, her husband was not, and her family was openly racist. He was (and probably still is) expected to attend all the family functions and she is close with her family. It always bothered me because if that was my spouse, I'd expect them to support me, not their bigoted family members.", "NTA but your wife sure is.

SIL's kids are going to learn that as long as you don't say the slurs to your cousin's, it's fine to treat them as less than because they're brown. The natural order of things is that you are entitled to more than the brown people and that's not racism because you are nice to their face. \n\nThat's how OP's son learns to accept this kind of treatment as normal and unavoidable.  \"It's just a crappy situation. Can you really expect your mom to choose you over her family when her family is objectively morally wrong?

His wife either goes complete no contact with them or the husband needs to remove himself and their son from a hostile situation. The wife\u2019s choice to keep in contact with all of those racists shows where her loyalty actually lies and it\u2019s not with her husband and child.
