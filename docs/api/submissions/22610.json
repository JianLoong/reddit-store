If she wants to go to the wedding knowing her son isn\u2019t included by them because of the color of his skin, she is encouraging the behavior to continue. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to go through this, my husband\u2019s family is the same way. It\u2019s caused a lot of issues in our relationship and it took him a while to finally put his foot down for our son\u2019s sake. I can\u2019t imagine how this will affect your son in the long run, kids aren\u2019t stupid.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine going to an event where my spouse and child were excluded based on their race. I don\u2019t care how \u201cnice\u201d sister has been in the past. She\u2019s a coward, and she sold her integrity for a wedding,", "NTA and honestly your wife has shown you exactly where her loyalty lies! Her family comes first and she\u2019s so disrespectful to you and your son and your feelings! I\u2019m also confused as to why after you were thrown out of your in law\u2019s house you eventually returned!! Pay attention to the red flags and I\u2019d seriously consider divorce!!", "NTA. Sister in law is choosing her racist parents over you and your son.  She\u2019s choosing racists.

The family is just wrong and ignorant. I don't know how you have been able to ever be in a room with them again, you are a hero for your wife and son.\n\nNo one can get upset with you because you are upset about this situation, you have done nothing wrong and this is just total BS. Can't give any advice to you that makes a difference other than to say I wish you didn't have to deal with the garbage family members.", " I am assuming by saying your son you mean a child you had with your wife.\n\nListen I am a mother. If my family ever treated my kids like this I would honestly turn into mother bear and scorch the earth. They would never see me or my child.\n\nBut honestly. I would suggest taking your son on a father son day because he doesn\u2019t need to be around those toxic people.  \n\nI would also honestly rethink this relationship. By your wife condoning their behavior by still having contact with them do you really want her around your child. Do you want your child to grow up thinking it\u2019s ok for anyone, even family, to treat him less than? Do you want your son to grow up thinking it\u2019s ok to keep the peace by letting your family treat your significant other like garbage? Because this is what your teaching him by staying with this woman.\n\nIf he is yours and your wife\u2019s child. I suggest you find yourself a damn good lawyer and file for full custody. I would also make sure to fight to keep her family away from him because I can damn sure guarantee they are emotionally if not physically abusing him!", "NTA. Your SIL, and your wife, tolerate their racist family. They put keeping the peace, and money, over their supposed ideals.", "No she does not. Her family is racist against her husband and her son???? She should be home with the family she made not the one she\u2019s from", "NTA by a long shot. Just because she's the nicest of them doesn't mean she's nice. In her shoes, I'd have a real small racist-free wedding to keep peace.

A lot  is made about \\*men\\* not standing up to their families for their wives... it goes the other way, too. Why is your wife not standing up for what's right? And your son won't be treated with the respect he deserves in a gathering of her family... does she not see this?", "NTA, your wife however, Is the asshole. Take this as you will; but your wife chose the side of racists who don\u2019t want you associated with the family over you and your son. Don\u2019t think your son won\u2019t be impacted by this, he will. Over time he will know what\u2019s up, and he will be hurt by it. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through and I\u2019m sorry.

Sadly, so is your wife.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly I want to say that I am so sorry that you\u2019re going through this situation and I really want to reassure you that you are not TA in any way whatsoever. Please remember this. \n\nYour SIL apologising for her family\u2019s horrible racist remarks is cancelled out by the fact that she has decided to not invite you or your son. She is prioritising her racist family under the disguise of \u201cwanting to keep the peace\u201d - she is no different than them in my opinion. \n\nAs for your wife, I would be extremely hurt if my partner agreed to go to a wedding that I wasn\u2019t invited to solely based on my background and my skin colour (I\u2019m a black woman), as I would see this as my partner not supporting me and instead siding with their racist family. NOW if we had a 5 year old child who was also not invited for the above reasons, I would be extremely mad and upset with my partner. \n\nTo add something else, I would go as far as to say that I wouldn\u2019t even have expected to have to explain to my partner why I don\u2019t think they should go. I would assume that it was self explanatory to not want to associate with family members who are racist towards my partner and child. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m extremely sorry that you\u2019re dealing with this and it is completely unfair on you and your child to be in this horrible situation. \n\nAs harsh as this may sound, I mean it coming from a kind place and in no way mean to be rude - I would really think about where your partner stands when it comes to her loyalties towards you and your family. \n\nI wish you the best and again, I\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019re experiencing this.", "I mean, NTA of course. But, Does it matter if she goes? She\u2019s excused and accepted her parents horrid mentality for years and doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s against you or your son. But you take a stand at someone else\u2019s event? The only difference between this racist event and the other racist events, is you won\u2019t be present to watch them be racist towards you. I\u2019m sure you love your wife but it\u2019s clear she loves her family more. You\u2019re looking for acceptance and validation from somewhere you won\u2019t find it, not even from your wife. At this point, you need to focus on your son. Children pick up on things very quickly and he needs to know he has at least one safe parent who understands the horribleness he will experience from your wife\u2019s family.", "NTA at ALL! I would be upset too. \n\nTruly, I understand how challenging it is to deal with problematic family members. Relationships are hard to navigate, and getting to a point where you can cut them off is a painful and complicated process. \n\nHowever, there is no excuse for your wife (and her sister) to continue to appease her family at the expense of you and your son. \n\nYour son does not deserve to grow up thinking that he is tainted for looking different. You don\u2019t deserve this either. By not choosing a side, your wife is choosing a side.", "\n\n>has never treated myself or my son any differently \n\nshe's not inviting you to her wedding. she is absolutely treating you differently. your fil shouldn't even be a part of either of their lives after how he's acted. both of them are guilty of enabling his racism by association. NTA, and you need to have a serious conversation with your wife about this.", "NAH I understand she wants to be there to support the only person who supported her.\nIf anything the AH would be the sister who doesn't have the courage to stand up to her racist dad because he's footing the bill.", "NAH. I think this is just a crappy situation. I totally understand you're hurt by the situation, I would be too. I just think she wants to be there for her sister like she was certainly always there for her. The fact they both grew up to (luckily) be two very different people from their parents makes me think they've always supported each others in the madness of that crazy household. Their dad sounds insane and it wasn't probably always fun.\n\nThat would be the ideal moment to make a statement but I also think she's afraid that would make her a bad sister not to go. Just a crappy situation overall.\n\nAlso I don't think that would be a good idea to put your son through this, he's better far way from those people.", "YTA for marrying into a racist family and being mad your wife doesn\u2019t want to completely cut ties with them.

I get where you\u2019re coming from and I hate even saying y t a but I\u2019m supposed to give an answer. Your SIL is trying to keep the peace at HER wedding. The best way to do that is to not create a hostile environment (racist family being racist\u2026the only way to prevent that is to not invite you OR not invite her family). She probably got a shit ton of grief from her family from supporting YOU. Now it\u2019s your time to support her.", "NTA. As your wife, I would never attend any event where my husband and my freaking child weren\u2019t welcome due to race. Not happening.", "The parents are TA. Everyone else is stuck in a weird situation. But as infuriated as I'd be if my husband and daughter were treated that way, nothing could keep me from my sister's wedding. Especially if she was my family member who supported me. And I don't know that I'd want my kid to be around a racist grandfather and a bar. I'd go, but I'd ignore my parents and focus on my sister. I think you should support your wife doing that.", "YTA. Your sister-in-law has been nothing but nice to you. She has to walk a fine line here so give her some slack. Your wife will go, suck it up and her support her sister. Have to like it but you should understand that she wants to be there for her sister. Remember the sister doesn't object to your marriage or is racist. She can't make everyone happy in this instance if she says sure you come with your son then she probably loses any financial support which sucks and it's a crappy position to be in. But you should have some empathy here.", "YTA, firstly if her sister was the only one that supported your relationship, you shouldn't stop your wife from going.

My first husband was black South African.  I was nervous about bringing him home at first to my grandparents but my grandparents adjusted and my son was also accepted.  In fact, my grandfather was so excited to finally be a great grand parent.  We split up but not based on skin color.  Then I married an Arab.  He looked white.  My mom flipped out.  I stood my ground and they ended up being quite good friends. The thing is, had any of my white relatives not accepted either of my husband's, my kids or my religion I would have just kept doing my thing.  Because like it or not when you marry, your spouse is your family too! She should stand by you.  And you guys should plan a sabotage where your wife can attend also.  By not only suiting up, but bringing all of your Samoan relatives along! Say goodbye to this wedding being about them.   They are the assholes!", "NTA  If she does feel that she needs to be there for her sister suggest she go the wedding only and then leave.

Not going to wedding to protect our children from emotional harm seems like an obvious (if not easy) decision.", "Why would she want to go to a wedding of someone who thinks her kid is less than because of his skin color is the more important question?\n\nWhy is the mother tolerating her family\u2019s treatment of the son?", "It\u2019s a bird, it\u2019s a plane, no\u2026it\u2019s the point flying right over your head.", "And there we have it\u2026true colors shown. It\u2019s amazing how easy it is for people to be dehumanized. Thankfully there is a good chance that any gifts will have to be returned. People suck. Americans suck.", "Do you know what\u2019s more important than having the people you want at your wedding? What\u2019s more important than the wedding, period? Doing what is right and human. The most important thing we will ever do during the course of our lives is strive to be decent human beings.", "\n\n>The bride wants her parents at the wedding.\n\nif you willingly associate with racist, then you yourself are racist. sil has made it clear who she really is by choosing them.", "He didn\u2019t tell her no. He asked if he was wrong  for thinking she should not go. He is not wrong for thinking it. He is allowed to voice his opinion on this, something that directly affects him and his child.", "The bar for integrity is the open bar.", "I think we agree?\n\nEdit: I see you are replying to original. Sorry.", "He asked if he was the AH for thinking she shouldn\u2019t go, and no he is not the asshole for thinking that, or even asking that. He can\u2019t force her not to go, so that\u2019s a moot point.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Because she chose not to stand in solidarity with her OWN child. You always show your child that you will not stand for them being treated unfairly, even if the person wronging them is your own sister. Also, you take a stand to be a role model for your child, to show them that sometimes we must sacrifice to do what is right.", "I think he should really rethink this relationship. Because his child deserves better! If the child\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t stand up for the child, which she isn\u2019t, then she is just as bad as the family!", "Yes, he should.", "Life isn\u2019t always black and white with a line drawn down the middle. The SIL can love her parents who are had people. It doesn\u2019t make her a bad person. That\u2019s like saying jill is a bad person because she married Tom who is abusive. Just bc jill loves Tom doesn\u2019t make her a bad person. It just makes her someone who loves a bad person.", "Apologies. Missed the \"for thinking\", I thought he has stopped her.", "Apologies. Missed the \"for thinking\", I thought he has stopped her", "This 100 recent!", "Sometimes it is that simple. He either has the right to be part of the family or he doesn\u2019t. Your side is clear, doesn\u2019t. There isn\u2019t any more.", "You can love people, and still make the hard decision to take a stand for your child. You do not let people treat your child as less than, even your own parents. This is a no contact situation, and that\u2019s not something I say lightly.", "It made her a bad person when she choose to exclude her nephew! \n\nIt made her a bad person when she choose a fancy wedding over treating her bil and nephew as people.", "Nor is there any more reason to acknowledge you, since I know you don\u2019t value me as a human. You can try and justify all you want, but it doesn\u2019t change the result. Just continue being a good little guard and tell yourself you did good."]}
