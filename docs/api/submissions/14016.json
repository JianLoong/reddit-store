They must be in such overwhelming pain hearing that you want to...\n\n>rest, recover and bond with my baby without an audience, suggestions or judgement.\n\nThey must be so hurt, and personally offended. How dare you prevent their right to observe you, judge you, impede your daily life, prevent you from relaxing...ok I can't keep up this sarcasm anymore.", "NTA you deserve to have privacy and recovery time after giving birth. You\u2019ve said yourself that they visit you often already, they can wait a little while. You should be able to take all the time you need to care for and bond with the new baby", "NTA, visitors when you have a newborn are NOT guests! They should only come if they intend to help! Cooking, cleaning, laundry, entertain older sibling, etc. Of course they can also hold the baby a bit but they're NOT guests that can expect to be entertained. You tried their way and it didn't work for you, so now you're doing it YOUR way!", "NTA.\n\nWhen my brother gave birth, my mom and I were constantly over at his house. You know why? We wanted to help him recover. He tore *bad* and was going through the Baby Blues. We would take my niece over night (in the same house just in the living room) so he and my BIL could recover for a night. We would watch her over weekends all the time. Family should be helping, not hindering.\n\nIDK how social his parents are versus you. You're the **Mom**\u2122. You make the rules and they can simply deal with it.", "Definitely NTA. We did this with all three of our children. We even restricted the hospital visits lol.\n\nFor me, having given birth I really was not in the mood to share my many adjusting moments (good and not so good) with anybody except my baby, my husband, my mom who was an angel for help (and I'm comfortable having \"loose parts\" around with my mom). Also, I just think its so overwhelming for the little baby who's still adjusting to this world. There's a reason why there's maternity leave. Its not a holiday for socializing and playing host, but a time to heal, bond, re calibrate, rest all in the peace and quiet of your home. Your body NEEDS it.", "NTA.\n\nYou've set boundries, you've not had a tantrum, you're not trying to exclude them from the babies life forever just while you settle.\n\nMaybe setting a day/weekend for them to visit so they can see the baby is a good compromise here, I understand that they would be incredibly excited as they are the grandparents.", "NTA.  It\u2019s good to have boundaries.", "NTA the fact that you ripped STITCHES to clean after them with baby no 1 proves they are not coming to help. So they can wait 12 weeks for you to recuperate.  Just claim they have to wait so you can host them in the style they have proven they demand.", "you dont EVER need strangers on the internet to agree or disagree with YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR CHILD. \n\nperiod.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who expects to come over and be waited on during a child's first year of life is automatically out of bounds. If they were coming to help you it'd be a different story. But if you're cooking and cleaning...sheesh.", "NTA and your in laws should have been more understanding after the last baby, not to mention your freaking husband should have picked up the hosting cleaning cooking actually not hosting he should have told your in laws you were spending your first Christmas as a family alone", "NTA. Your wish to have them wait 12 weeks is completely reasonable. It also would be reasonable to expect them to visit less often, clean up after themselves,  stay in a hotel, etc. Just because they don't live near you does not give them an open invitation to staying in your home and you being their servant for days. If you do want them to stay with you,  then your husband needs to take on most of the hosting duties since it's his family.", "NTA", "NTA. My daughters asked me to stay for a week after each of my granddaughters was born. I got to witness the births and it was amazing. While they were still in the hospital, I went grocery shopping and filled the refrigerator and pantry. I did laundry. I vacuumed and dusted and cleaned bathrooms. When they came home, I cooked all meals. I got to hold my granddaughters whenever my daughters wanted a break. My role was to help. What you are describing is a nightmare.", "NTA.", "Question: do your in-laws always stay with you? Could you or, preferably your hubby, suggest a hotel to give you's a break? \n\nTotally see where you're coming from, I'm an introvert too and that amount of people time can be mentally draining, never mind just after giving birth", "NTA!!! Good on you for setting boundaries!", "NTA. You\u2019re not cutting them out it\u2019s 12 weeks! There is the rest of the child\u2019s life!", "NTA\n\nThat's way too many visits in the first year when you are exhausted and I'm guessing a lot of those visits are where people think they are being helpful by \"holding the baby\" rather than doing laundry, cooking meals, vacuuming and cleaning bathrooms, etc.\n\nAlso, your husband is the one who needs to set the boundaries with his parents. He is the one who needs to handle them if they \"are messy.\" He is the one who needs to take charge and make sure that you and baby are getting plenty of time to recharge and sleep and assigning his parents tasks. Mom, can you start some laundry? Dad, can you watch child #1 while I clean the bathrooms? Oh great, mom, the laundry is done. Can you fold it, and then prep lunch? Dad, now can you change diapers? Zero of this should come from you. Your husband should literally be on top of his \"messy\" parents all day, giving them things to do so that they have new expectations on what coming to your house looks like. And it's not \"hold the baby\" while you entertain and clean for them after just pushing a human out of your body 12 weeks ago.", "NTA", "Your husband is a major AH.\n\n>I had stitches from tearing and was cleaning, cooking, hosting, etc. \n\nWhy were you doing this at all for *his* guests? Let alone after a major medical event. *He* should have been hosting *his* family. If he's gone at work during the day he should have made it clear that anyone who wasn't a newborn or had just given birth to a newborn would be helping cook, clean, run to the store, do laundry, etc. That is the point of family visiting after you have a baby.\n\nDefinitely NTA for not allowing them back right away but your husband is the biggest problem.", "NTA - you need time to rest, heal and bond with your baby. Would they not be willing to compromise though? Could your husband's parents come, just the two of them, and only for one night to see the baby?", "NTA. OMG who  imposes on a new mother by having her host out of state visitors multi time? Usually if family comes to visit they take over all the work and let the new mama rest.  If your husband doesn't get that then he's not thinking of his own family first. Certainly your inlaws can video chat to meet the baby. Whatever you do stand your ground.", "NTA. You\u2019re being clear about your needs and not being unreasonable about the amount of time you need. Your entire family needs to adjust to a new baby.", "NTA!\n\nYour baby, Your bonding time, Your recovery. Everyone can calm down and wait until YOU are ready, including your husband :)", "Is your husband an invertebrate? That can be the only explanation for his lack of a spine in standing up to his family. \n\n NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your child, not theirs. You can have as much privacy and alone time as you want.", "NAH. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled not want any guests in your house. You don\u2019t owe them a place to stay whenever they feel like it. \n\nThey\u2019re also allowed to be hurt since this seems like the first time they\u2019ve ever had a boundary. You\u2019re not wrong, but it feels bad for them so that\u2019s likely why they\u2019re upset. \n\nFamily visits are something you and your husband need to renegotiate. \n\nI would also say that if they are not helping you while they are there to visit the baby/kiddos- helping cook, helping with feeding times so you can sleep, giving you a moment to yourself/to recharge those Introvert batteries, etc- then they are AH. Helpers are the only people welcome to the house, otherwise they\u2019re depleting your already low battery.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your baby, and as such, your decision who gets to meet him/her and when. May is only one month away, and it should give you and your husband some privacy with your babies. If they don't realize how overbearing they are, I can see why they might be disappointed, but they'll get the chance to visit *after* you've sufficiently recovered.", "> I had stitches from tearing and was cleaning, cooking, hosting, etc.\n\nAre they expecting/demanding that? Because if not, the effort is about your priorities, not their expectations. INFO", "NTA. And this time they stay in a hotel", "You are 100% NTA. You might consider posting in r/beyondthebump for advice on how to handle them. Lots of people on there have had situations with pushy in laws", "NTA but also I'd like to know why your husband wasn't on hosting duty last time? Why were you doing all of that?", "NAH.\n\nHowever YWBTA for having your family/friends around and specifically cutting your husband's out. Have you discussed them staying in an alternative place and still being able to see you and baby in small doses?\n\nYou definitely need time to recover, maybe with them in town dad could take baby out for an hour or two to see them and give you rest at the same time", "NAH. I can see where both of you are coming from in this situation. I wouldn't want to host anyone after giving birth. I would just want to be left alone to heal and bond with my new baby. Your post states your in laws live a cross the country so maybe they are visiting so much because they want to make sure they have bond and relationship with your kids. It's hard to develop a close relationship when you live across the country. Yes you can call and video chat, but your kids are really too young to engage that way. I was away at college when my sister had my nephew. Everytime I would come home to visit he would scream and it would take most of the my break before he would finally warm up to me. Eventually we became close but that was after I finished school and moved home for a year. Once he got to know and spend time with me it made it easier to maintain a relationship when I moved to another city. Nothing in your post suggest they are horrible people. I don't know what your relationship is like with your in laws but if you are close or friendly they may have geniune fear that you would prefer to cut them out of your kids lives. I'm not saying this to make you feel guilty. I'm just trying to give you a different perspective. You know your in laws so you are better able to judge what is truly in their hearts than I can as a stranger on Reddit.", "NTA and PLEASE don\u2019t bend on this!!! Treat yourself to all the peace and quiet that you should have had with your first baby. In-laws can suck it up. They will live, I promise. If they want to lay any guilt-tripping bullshit on you, you can hang up the phone, end the visit, block their numbers, etc. You do not have to accept treatment like that.", "NTA. \n\nYour baby, your choices. Good job setting boundaries!", "I\u2019d be curious to know the boundaries that the OP has set for her own parents / family.  If her family has gotten to see the baby, I could see why the husband and in-laws would be upset.", "NTA, at all.  Fellow introvert here, and I was horrified reading your post!  Hang in there and keep your boundaries.  Tell the in-laws from me that it is not personal--it is personality.  Good luck, OP!  Best wishes for a happy, healthy baby and acres of alone time!", "YtA and sometimes that's fine.\n\nYou can set whatever boundaries you want, just accept that others will judge and critique your boundaries because it prevents them from doing whatever they want.

If they are the boundary stomping type then get a ring doorbell because they will show up before the 12 week mark and don\u2019t let them in. They will go back home.  If they manage to get to 12 weeks then make sure they get a hotel and they are only allowed in your home during visiting hours of say 9-11 and 2-5 or whatever you\u2019re comfortable with.  Looks like they are already using the FOG (fear, obligation, guilt) to get their way. You and husband need to be on the same page and he personally needs to shiny his spine and have your back. Boundaries without consequences are just suggestions.
