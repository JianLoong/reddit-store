{"id": 15895, "submission_id": "131sarm", "title": "AITA for not giving up a power outlet on the train?", "selftext": "I (24m) was riding the train to the airport for a trip. I was a student at the time, so I brought my laptop in order to keep up on assignments while I was away from home.\n\nThe train seating is arranged into small bays of 4 seats--2 seats across from two other seats. About half of the seat bays have small tables in the center, and those with tables also have a power outlet with two sockets beneath the table.\n\nAs one of the very first people on the train, I was able to find an empty bay with a table and two open sockets. My computer and phone batteries were both running low, so I figured I would charge my devices on the hour-long train ride rather than at the airport (especially since I would have to make an effort to find open outlets at the airport, and then wait for my devices to charge).  I plugged my phone into one outlet and my computer into the other.\n\nA couple of stops later, all of the bays with tables (and outlets) had at least one person sitting in them. A lady (probably 50s) boarded the train and, seeing that there were no vacant seating bays, came and sat across from me. As the train started moving, she pulled out her phone charger and went to plug it in.  Only then did she see that I was using both plugs.  She asked if I would unplug one of my devices so she could plug her phone in.  I said, \"Sorry, I actually need them both right now\" but I didn't go into any more detail than that.  She lost her temper and called me a \"f---ing misogynist\" and got up to find somewhere else to sit.  She sat down next to another lady further down the train car and continued yell out curses toward me and would occasionally raise her voice so I could hear her say things like \"chauvinist\" and \"male privelage\".\n\nI didn't intend to offend this lady and I certainly don't feel like I'm any better than she is. My thought when telling her I needed both outlets was simply that I was there first, so I had the right-of-way. I would have responded to anybody else the same way, regardless of age, gender, etc. Yes, the other seating bays were technically occupied, but they weren't so crowded that she couldn't have found an open outlet if she had just tried looking. I believe she had no trouble finding an outlet after she relocated from across from me. I assume that she sat next to me at first because I was close to the door.  Also, it would've been very difficult for her to see before sitting down that I was using both sockets, because the table blocks the view of the outlet.\n\nAITA for not letting this lady use one of the power outlets?\n\nEdit: I'll admit that I could have plugged my phone into my computer. However, I know from experience that my phone charges extremely slowly in that scenario--only about 20-30% per hour max as opposed to fully charged in the same amount of time.  So it didn't seem like a necessary compromise, as I would have still needed to find somewhere else to charge soon afterward.\n\nEdit 2: I do typically charge my devices before I leave the house. In this instance, it was late afternoon/early evening and I had already been at school all day, which is why my devices were already depleted. I hadn't had a good chance to sit down and charge yet.\n\nEdit 3: The idea to plug my phone into my computer didn't actually occur to me until later in the train ride after this exchange had happened. It's still true that the charging speed would be an issue. So in the moment, it felt like I would have been choosing between charging my phone or not charging my phone (as opposed to charging my phone or charging it slowly). If that idea had occurred to me in the moment, I may have done it. Maybe. There were still plenty of other open outlets throughout the train though. And the lady certainly wasn't offering any other helpful suggestions.", "created_utc": 1682689719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131sarm/aita_for_not_giving_up_a_power_outlet_on_the_train/", "score": 686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that this takes longer doesn't matter. You thinking that it does, is just proving this lady was right.

She shouldn't have yelled at you until she checked either.\n\nIf there were no other outlets available, you should have shared. On unassigned seating trains, the seats are first come, first served. As a matter of etiquette, though, that doesn't apply to the outlets, which are there for all passengers in the 4 person bay to use and the proper thing to do is share the outlets equally over your travel time. You failed at basic public courtesy and, if there had not been other outlets available nearby, you would have been a big asshole.\n\nAs long as we are on courtesy and traveling and preparedness, your devices should be fully charged when you leave the house. You created a situation by not being fully prepared.\n\nAlso, ethical rules don't generally depend on factors of status, with some limited exceptions relating to disabilities.

While she did overreact imo, you still say you were right to use both outlets even now. That negates any e-sh vote i would have used normally. Because she was polite at first. You were just an AH.

You turn call me a rude insult and spit in my face. I then throw a fist and hit you somewhere. Our friends pull us apart.\n\nGuess what? We're both assholes and most bars are tossing us both out. Me for the punch, you for the spit and insult. That's 100% an ESH situation.", "Clearly she was looking for a fight if that was her initial reaction to him saying no. \n\nAny other normal human beings would have suggested using the computer to charge his phone or if even using his computer to charger HER phone. Her reaction didn\u2019t even give them the chance to come to these solutions.", "Source? Did you make the sub's rules?", "He can charge when he gets to his destination. He\u2019s not going to \u201cfall behind\u201d on assignments during the duration of his flight. He\u2019s not without options. Legally, sure he didn\u2019t have to do shit. But he lives in a society, and in that society he\u2019s a fucking asshole. Full stop.", "Jesus. No... Unless you mean deliberately bumping and spilling a drink?\n\nYou can't spit in somebody's face just because a drink gets spilled. That's assault in my country. If somebody assaults you it's not asshole behaviour to hit them.", "But.. is the question asking are you an AH for spitting in someones face? or is the question asking if you are an for bumping into someone at a crowded bar?\n\nOP asked if he was an AH for withholding a charging station. You can define NTA or ESH in whatever way you want in your head, but do you think you OP and you would be on the same page if he had heard ESH vs YTA?\n\nHe is still an AH regardless of her reaction. She is also an AH. I am just pointing out that the question isn't about her reaction or her manners, it's specifically tied to his withholding the power.", "But she didn\u2019t need to make suggestions. She\u2019s not his partner or friend. Communal outlets are not first come first serve. They are there in case more than one person needs to charge a device.", "If she was the one who posted this story asking if she were the A-Hole, then it would have been an E S H, because her reaction was over the top.  But it was perfectly reasonable for her to request access to the outlet and he unreasonably denied it's a YTA.", "There are countless situations where there is not enough of a resource to cater to the needs and wants of everyone involved. If you fail to understand that, that's on you. This is one. It is unfortunate but you cannot get upset with people for that.", "Also OP says there were many open outlets, so this entire situation did not need to happen.", "1. Yeah, that's why it's an asshole move. I was trying to sketch a hypothetical situation.\n\n2. In the US you have what's called measured response. You can't up the ante in assault cases. If someone spits on you, you generally don't get to throw fists. Both of you got to jail for that. \n\nIf they attack you with fists first, you can *defend*  yourself, but only yo the point that you don't need to continue. So you can knock them down or chase them off, but once it's clear they no longer want to fight you can't keep hitting them.\n\nIn a spitting case, you can't just strike back. That's going to get you arrested for assault too. Possibly assault and battery since they *just* spit. \n\nNot saying it makes sense or even is reasonable, but that's how it is here.", "I disagree I think it\u2019s def a ESH and if it was her posting it I may even say it would be YTA.\n\nAnyone who blows up that quick is either in a bad mood from something else and this set them off or they were looking for a fight. Yeah OP was an AH but once she reacted like that she\u2019s the AH too and the bigger one IMO.", "Yeah like why didn't the Lady go looking for an available outlet before asking to use one that's already in use? Even in a full train, all outlets are rarely used.\n\nAsking to use an outlet that's being used in a train with lots of outlets is the asshole behaviour."]}
