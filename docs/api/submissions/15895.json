I was a student at the time, so I brought my laptop in order to keep up on assignments while I was away from home.\n\nThe train seating is arranged into small bays of 4 seats--2 seats across from two other seats. About half of the seat bays have small tables in the center, and those with tables also have a power outlet with two sockets beneath the table.\n\nAs one of the very first people on the train, I was able to find an empty bay with a table and two open sockets. My computer and phone batteries were both running low, so I figured I would charge my devices on the hour-long train ride rather than at the airport (especially since I would have to make an effort to find open outlets at the airport, and then wait for my devices to charge).  I plugged my phone into one outlet and my computer into the other.\n\nA couple of stops later, all of the bays with tables (and outlets) had at least one person sitting in them. A lady (probably 50s) boarded the train and, seeing that there were no vacant seating bays, came and sat across from me. As the train started moving, she pulled out her phone charger and went to plug it in.  Only then did she see that I was using both plugs.  She asked if I would unplug one of my devices so she could plug her phone in.  I said, \"Sorry, I actually need them both right now\" but I didn't go into any more detail than that.  She lost her temper and called me a \"f---ing misogynist\" and got up to find somewhere else to sit.  She sat down next to another lady further down the train car and continued yell out curses toward me and would occasionally raise her voice so I could hear her say things like \"chauvinist\" and \"male privelage\".\n\nI didn't intend to offend this lady and I certainly don't feel like I'm any better than she is. My thought when telling her I needed both outlets was simply that I was there first, so I had the right-of-way. I would have responded to anybody else the same way, regardless of age, gender, etc. Yes, the other seating bays were technically occupied, but they weren't so crowded that she couldn't have found an open outlet if she had just tried looking. I believe she had no trouble finding an outlet after she relocated from across from me. I assume that she sat next to me at first because I was close to the door.  Also, it would've been very difficult for her to see before sitting down that I was using both sockets, because the table blocks the view of the outlet.\n\nAITA for not letting this lady use one of the power outlets?\n\nEdit: I'll admit that I could have plugged my phone into my computer. However, I know from experience that my phone charges extremely slowly in that scenario--only about 20-30% per hour max as opposed to fully charged in the same amount of time.  So it didn't seem like a necessary compromise, as I would have still needed to find somewhere else to charge soon afterward.\n\nEdit 2: I do typically charge my devices before I leave the house. In this instance, it was late afternoon/early evening and I had already been at school all day, which is why my devices were already depleted. I hadn't had a good chance to sit down and charge yet.", "created_utc": 1682689719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131sarm/aita_for_not_giving_up_a_power_outlet_on_the_train/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that this takes longer doesn't matter. You thinking that it does, is just proving this lady was right. Just because you boarded the train first doesn't mean you have more right to monopolise amenities.

She shouldn't have yelled at you until she checked either.\n\nIf there were no other outlets available, you should have shared. On unassigned seating trains, the seats are first come, first served. As a matter of etiquette, though, that doesn't apply to the outlets, which are there for all passengers in the 4 person bay to use and the proper thing to do is share the outlets equally over your travel time. You failed at basic public courtesy and, if there had not been other outlets available nearby, you would have been a big asshole.\n\nAs long as we are on courtesy and traveling and preparedness, your devices should be fully charged when you leave the house. You created a situation by not being fully prepared.\n\nAlso, ethical rules don't generally depend on factors of status, with some limited exceptions relating to disabilities.

Whatever the hell that means on a train. \n\nAs someone who has frequented trains many times in the past, it seems ridiculous and selfish the way you acted. \n\nShe shouldn't have had a tantrum, you shouldn't have acted like you own the outlets.

You obviously need to learn how to share.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  Her only for the extreme reaction.\n\nUsing both power outlets in a 4-seat section is obnoxious.

Using both of them is just jerky.", "YTA. You don't get both ports.", "YTA but not sexist for this.

While she did overreact imo, you still say you were right to use both outlets even now. That negates any e-sh vote i would have used normally. Because she was polite at first. You were just an AH.
