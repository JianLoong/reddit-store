Now if he\u2019s paying more than he can afford, then accept that he can\u2019t afford this lifestyle and needs to move back home. The financial abuse accusation was beyond unreasonable.

If you're both fine with it, that's that. \n\nSecond, you are already paying for waaaay more than 50% when you factor in the mortgage. And while I don't think he should pay for your equity, paying for his own use of utilities is more than fair, and considerably less than he'd be paying anywhere else. Paying your way is part of adulting and you're not his mom. Of course he needs to carry his weight.\n\nThird, he's not trapped, he can move back to his parents if he needs to. Or, ya know, talk to you himself without a meddling busybody in the way.\n\nLast, you're not married, and it's a relationship of a few months. If this was a post about a partner of less than a year wanting basically a free ride, we'd all be calling them gold diggers and waving red flags. \n\nYour boyfriend seems to understands his responsibilities as an adult, your friend was really out of line basically infantilizing him.

He chose to move in 5-6 months into dating you for convenience. He chose to go back to school rather than work full time - and students generally are poorer than fully employed people.\n\nLaughing was tactless, but so is accusing someone of financial abuse just because they earn more than a new partner.", "You're NTA. David needs to stay in his lane and not tell you how to live or how to spend your money. He's yet another person who can be very generous with someone else's money. Did Matt even say anything to him, or did he just decide to make a judgment based solely on his observations and then appoint himself Matt's spokesman?", "NTA - firstly Matt may very well be capable of coming to you about his financial concerns, and if there was financial abuse going on David should go to the potential *victim* not the potential *abuser* about such concerns.", "Nta bc clearly you are paying more than him.

How yall divide money is up to you.", "NTA  \n\n\nThat isn't financial abuse. It just isn't.  Financial abuse is where you control the money and use that to control the actions and decisions of another person. It's hard to think of how financial abuse could exist between two young able-bodied adults. There has to be other circumstances.  \n\n\nIt occurs frequently in relationships with children, elderly, disabled or people who can't work due to legal or logistical issues. There is  control first and then the finanaces are used to increase that control.    \n\n\nThat said, if you pushed David to go on a trip he can't actually afford, that's not a kind thing to do, but it's not abusive.", "NTA\n\nYour friend gets what he deserves for his ridiculous observations and demand. It's not his business how you lead your relationship. \n\nIf Matt didn't live with you he would have to pay a whole rent and utilities all alone so he wouldn't be able to save money either way. \n\nIf you allowed him to pay less THEN he'd be \"trapped\" because he knows that he'll be financially better staying with you and get used to a lifestyle that he can't afford on his own yet - then he might feel like he has to stay in a relationship with you because he can't pay for the lifestyle on his own and doesn't want to downgrade. \n\nIt's another thing if you would have been together for longer already and contributed equally for some years. Then you can always agree on shifting the payments \"for 1 year because of an academical training\" and then go back to equal splitting. That's what partners do - when the pink glasses are gone and they know that they can rely on one another in every sense..", "ESH.\n\nPresumably he does not know the detail of your finances, so calling you an abuser is way past the line.\n\nHe's not wrong about 50/50 being a trap for the lower earner, but if you are paying the mortgage and BF isn't paying anything toward it, you do not have a 50/50 split.  I'm guessing that you are already paying >70% of base expenses when you factor in mortgage, property taxes, and insurance.\n\nBut he is  your friend, and laughing in his face is an AH move.  You could have responded much better, and you could also have made it clear that the household split is not 50/50 if you wanted to have a real discussion with your friend, or just politely told him that your finances are private and not up for discussion.

He\u2019s getting a free place to live and as an adult, he\u2019d still have to pay utilities and food. I suppose it comes down to the cost of dates and vacations that he agrees to go on.

He already can\u2019t afford to live on his own and it would be a matter of how long his parents are willing to continue funding an adult child though.", "NTA and honestly he shouldn't get into your business, that's very rude.", "NTA, sounds like David's idea of a relationship is a parent not 2 individuals in a relationship, I'd honestly stop being David's friend, I'd tell him your relationship and financials aren't his place to comment on, that you each pay 50% because as 2 people you each take up 50% of the resources in your home and that if David feels like your boyfriend is being financially abused he's more than welcome to take your boyfriend in and support him", "NTA-your financial arrangements are not David\u2019s business. He had no right to bring it up. Having said that-your dismissive attitude about this is also concerning. I want to clarify that what he was saying is generally true for a married couple who wants to keep finances separate (50-50 is not fruitful-see the numerous other posts on this topic). It is NOT ideal for a couple that is unmarried though, so you are doing the right thing for now at least. If Matt is having trouble keeping up with you, you may want to discuss with him what ways you can adjust together to ensure that you are both financially comfortable.", "NTA.

If your boyfriend is upset about your financial arrangement he should talk to you about it directly.", "I am usually in favor of a prorata way for common things (utilities, dates, rent) but as he does not pay any rent (and yes this point is really relevant), I think your boyfriend has a very good deal here.

However, it's your relationship with Matt, and your finances need to be done in a way that works for both of you. \n\nI do think laughing at David was rude, and apologising would be the right thing to do.

I still pay for stuff and take us out to dinner etc., but as she has more disposable income, she covers more.\n\nyou sound incredibly selfish by comparison - yours isn't a relationship that I'd choose to put myself into and laughing in the face of a friend who thought that watching as your partner struggles to keep up wasnt fair makes it even worse.\n\nim drawn to 'but matt lives with me for free'.. do you see this as a 50/50 relationship, or is this some guy that lives with you? you dont give the impression that theres a lot of togetherness there at all.\n\nall in all, YTA.", "NAH.\n\nBut I honestly don\u2019t understand how anybody could love someone and be ok with having a vastly different living standard when they\u2019ve chosen to live their lives together.", "NTA\n\nHe obviously could just go back to live with his parents. \n\nHe's barely contributing. \n\nHe opted to join the vacation. \n\nYour friend is out of line esp regarding a relationship that's not even a year old. \n\nBut.

David did.  It's David that has the issue.\n\nBased on OP's comments above, before moving in with OP Matt was living with his parents with the same arrangement (rent free, but paying a small amount for utilities).  So financially, living with OP is no different than living with his parents.\n\nAlso, we don't know if Matt is the one who WANTS to pay for meals 50/50 and doesn't want to be accused of mooching off of OP.\n\nWe are really missing Matt's perspective in all of this.", "I agree with you. I think it makes sense that you wouldn't want to pay into a gf/bf's mortage, since 1 you won't get any equity if you break up and 2 the mortage costs the same regardless. At the same time though,  he *is* getting free room and board, and she is not getting free room and board, so she is definitely paying more than 50-50. \n\n\n\n The person you replied to is all over this thread claiming it's actually him paying more, proportionally to income, because they think it's irrelevant that she pays for their housing.  I don't think anyone is gonna be able to reason them out of that position because they didn't reason themselves into it.", "Agreed! Laughing was the kind response by OP.  David's assumptions about others' finances and that his opinion was relevant and warranted is what is ridiculous. I feel bad for David's future partners, on the first date he'd likely want to make a shared budget in his favor.", "If it was so obviously not abuse, would David had spoken up? It's apparent that things weren't so obvious to him.", "She is definitely not doing what the friend says. I would give the friend a higher a.h. score than OP.

OP is already letting him live rent free while paying the whole mortgage herself. All he pays for is half the food and half the utilities (utilities about $50/month). She's supporting him plenty.\n\nIt would be nice to offer to pay for his vacation meals but let's not act like she's not already helping financially support him.  A guy she's been with for less than a year, who moved in after like 5 months.

I'm guessing he was concerned OP was unaware/unintentionally financially abusing their BF. That happens too. It's also quite possible he did ask OP's BF, and the BF claimed they split everything 50/50 (either forgetting or not considering rent/mortgage).  \n\nWhile I think he shouldn't have jumped to conclusions, I don't think he was being awful by drawing his friend's attention to the harm of what he thought was happening.", "I don't mean to say that it is, or that David was in the right here. His initial concern for his friend is one thing, however misguided it might be, but the whole \"he didn't pay rent at home\" argument show's that his motivations have shifted toward being right and winning the argument.\n\nI'm merely pointing out that it doesn't matter whether you or I find something to be obvious as internet strangers, the people actually living through the situation did not (obviously) or they wouldn't have adopted their position in the first place.\n\nCalling something obvious after being provided with additional context after the fact is rather silly, and holds no bearing on the reality of the situation, which is that it was not obvious to the relevant person involved.", "I would certainly hope so, but not knowing David I couldn't say. Unfortunately, many people view covering for the indiscretions of those they care about as a form of loyalty, and this mindset seems to be even more prevalent when misogyny gets mixed into the situation.

He pays for half of the food and utilities so those costs are indeed split and the fact that he's not paying rent/board doesn't actually change that....  My point was that even that might not be a small enough share for him to be financially stable and it's easy to not know that in these situations. Which is why I recommended the open and regular conversations with the partner to mitigate these issues.....", "I'm not the person who called it obvious.

That is up to each individual couple, personally I would not advise paying for half of your partner's mortage as you would be contrubuting to their equity and wouldn't see any of it if you break up. But it isn't just irrelevant when looking at how they split their costs as a couple. It's not 50/50.", "The fact he is not paying for room and board does change that he is not paying 50/50.

She is not asking for rent money, which she could by the way just a 50-50 split of the rest.\n\nFor all we know he is more than ok with it since it gets him out of his parents' house.

It could be 30/70 or 90/10 or 25/75 etc. I never said equal and i never said 50/50 soooo yeah honestly don't know why you're going on about that particular percentage split. \n\nIs it really so surprising to you that other percentage splits are possible and may be more appropriate? Not paying room and board certainly means the cost split won't be 50/50 but it could still be 30/70 and that might still be more than they can really afford and that would still be splitting costs... Because that's how math works???????? So confused by your replies honestly.", "And honestly, it's a bad precedent to set to pay for everything and just let that become the expectation.\n\nI think the most one could expect is that if she invites him out to dinner and picks a place he can't really afford, maybe she could offer to pay more or pay the whole bill as what matters to her is that they do it together.\n\nBut really, just doing things together that the both of them can swing makes the most sense.", ">So why the fuck do you keep going on about him paying rent? \n\n\nUh, Why the fuck are you being so agressive....? \n\n\nIt is relevant to the post that they don't  split costs 50/50. \n\n>He spends proportionally more of his income than she does. \n\n\nI don't see where OP posted either of their incomes, or how much she pays for her mortgage, or says anywhere at all that he pays proportionally more.", "You are wrong. She pays more than him. You want him to freeload actually not to pay rent pay a small part of groceries basically to OP to feed an adult man.", "\"Splitting the cost\" means 50/50. Nobody says \"let's split this\" and means anything other than 50/50 unless they specifically say another fraction. Sooooo yeah honestly seems like you're kind of backpeddaling with \"well I didn't say it was split 50-50\" other wise what is the point of your comment? Your comment doesn't make any sense or have any relevance if you meant it any way other than 50/50.\n\n\nHe pays 50 a month for utilities and no rent. At that point if he's still paying proportionally more then he needs to pick up more hours or get a second job."]}
