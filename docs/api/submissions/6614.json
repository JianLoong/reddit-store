If you're both fine with it, that's that. \n\nSecond, you are already paying for waaaay more than 50% when you factor in the mortgage. And while I don't think he should pay for your equity, paying for his own use of utilities is more than fair, and considerably less than he'd be paying anywhere else. Paying your way is part of adulting and you're not his mom. Of course he needs to carry his weight.\n\nThird, he's not trapped, he can move back to his parents if he needs to.

If this was a post about a partner of less than a year wanting basically a free ride, we'd all be calling them gold diggers and waving red flags. \n\nYour boyfriend seems to understands his responsibilities as an adult, your friend was really out of line basically infantilizing him.

He chose to move in 5-6 months into dating you for convenience. He chose to go back to school rather than work full time - and students generally are poorer than fully employed people.\n\nLaughing was tactless, but so is accusing someone of financial abuse just because they earn more than a new partner.", "You're NTA. David needs to stay in his lane and not tell you how to live or how to spend your money. He's yet another person who can be very generous with someone else's money. Did Matt even say anything to him, or did he just decide to make a judgment based solely on his observations and then appoint himself Matt's spokesman?", "NTA - firstly Matt may very well be capable of coming to you about his financial concerns, and if there was financial abuse going on David should go to the potential *victim* not the potential *abuser* about such concerns.", "Nta bc clearly you are paying more than him.

How yall divide money is up to you.", "NTA  \n\n\nThat isn't financial abuse. It just isn't.  Financial abuse is where you control the money and use that to control the actions and decisions of another person. It's hard to think of how financial abuse could exist between two young able-bodied adults. There has to be other circumstances.  \n\n\nIt occurs frequently in relationships with children, elderly, disabled or people who can't work due to legal or logistical issues. There is  control first and then the finanaces are used to increase that control.    \n\n\nThat said, if you pushed David to go on a trip he can't actually afford, that's not a kind thing to do, but it's not abusive.", "NTA\n\nYour friend gets what he deserves for his ridiculous observations and demand. It's not his business how you lead your relationship. \n\nIf Matt didn't live with you he would have to pay a whole rent and utilities all alone so he wouldn't be able to save money either way. \n\nIf you allowed him to pay less THEN he'd be \"trapped\" because he knows that he'll be financially better staying with you and get used to a lifestyle that he can't afford on his own yet - then he might feel like he has to stay in a relationship with you because he can't pay for the lifestyle on his own and doesn't want to downgrade. \n\nIt's another thing if you would have been together for longer already and contributed equally for some years. Then you can always agree on shifting the payments \"for 1 year because of an academical training\" and then go back to equal splitting.

I'm guessing that you are already paying >70% of base expenses when you factor in mortgage, property taxes, and insurance.\n\nBut he is  your friend, and laughing in his face is an AH move.  You could have responded much better, and you could also have made it clear that the household split is not 50/50 if you wanted to have a real discussion with your friend, or just politely told him that your finances are private and not up for discussion.

He\u2019s getting a free place to live and as an adult, he\u2019d still have to pay utilities and food. I suppose it comes down to the cost of dates and vacations that he agrees to go on.

He had no right to bring it up. Having said that-your dismissive attitude about this is also concerning. I want to clarify that what he was saying is generally true for a married couple who wants to keep finances separate (50-50 is not fruitful-see the numerous other posts on this topic). It is NOT ideal for a couple that is unmarried though, so you are doing the right thing for now at least.

I still pay for stuff and take us out to dinner etc., but as she has more disposable income, she covers more.\n\nyou sound incredibly selfish by comparison - yours isn't a relationship that I'd choose to put myself into and laughing in the face of a friend who thought that watching as your partner struggles to keep up wasnt fair makes it even worse.\n\nim drawn to 'but matt lives with me for free'.. do you see this as a 50/50 relationship, or is this some guy that lives with you? you dont give the impression that theres a lot of togetherness there at all.\n\nall in all, YTA.", "NAH.\n\nBut I honestly don\u2019t understand how anybody could love someone and be ok with having a vastly different living standard when they\u2019ve chosen to live their lives together.", "NTA\n\nHe obviously could just go back to live with his parents. \n\nHe's barely contributing. \n\nHe opted to join the vacation. \n\nYour friend is out of line esp regarding a relationship that's not even a year old. \n\nBut.

Neither is a good option for him. \n\nAnd restaurants is just one example. There's many other situations where a similar dynamic might apply.

A simple example: if he can't afford to pay for lobster, but you as a high-earner want to eat lobster once a week, you should be paying for the increase in expenses between the lobster and what he would have eaten had you not made the choice to eat lobster once a week. It would be incredibly rude to be just buying lobster for one once a week and eating it in front of him while he had his dinner of 25cent instant ramen.\n\nThis often is most explained with rent, though you're not splitting rent with him: if you're a high earner who values living centrally close to your work in a two bedroom place so you can have an office, but he only has the budget to afford a one bedroom place in a cheaper area and would be happy living there, you should either go halfsies on the cheaper one bedroom place in his budget OR carry the entire burden of the difference in rent between the place he can afford and the one that you want. He didn't pay rent before-- if he couldn't afford to rent anywhere but YOU wanted him to live with you to save the commute to see him, and would have been absolutely cool with the commute and living with his parents... yeah, it's absolutely fair that you don't charge him any rent. It he wanted to move in with you primarily, not the other way around, then the fact he wasn't paying rent previously doesn't matter as much (but what he'd be willing to pay moving somewhere new with you, if the expenses elsewhere would be less, would matter.)\n\nIf you expect him to pay half or not participate in your life, when you're making lifestyle choices (such as frequency of eating out, how expensive the restaurants are, ect) out of his budget, yeah, YTA. The solution may not be to just split based on percentage though. It may be just to live within his budget and continue to go halfsies, if you want. At this point in your relationship, I would say that travel without him isn't necessarily comparable to eating lobster in front of hir ramen, but it certainly could still become so. \n\nBut if you chose the vacation and its expenses without regards to his budget (think something like \"you carry half the expenses of this ski trip I chose, nevermind skiing isnt your thing and if you went without me youd be renting the cheapest air bnb you can find and I chose a suite on the resort\") or if it's purpose was to see your friends or family, then this may be a trip where you should have carried most of the costs regardless of your general split.", "NTA\n\ncombining or not combining finances is entirely a personal relationship choice between partners.

Instead, what I see is a selfish person who doesn't trust Matt to have your back, and so you are hamstringing Matt's career potential under the guise of fairness.\n\nEvery relationship is different, but typically if you are in it for the long haul, you aren't supposed to split 50/50 constantly, at every waking moment. It just needs to resolve and settle to near half and half over the long term, and effort can replace money.\n\nFor example, I was in grad school while my fiance worked. She didn't make me \"pay\" half the utilities, or rent, or food costs because she knew I would eventually get a job. We lived a good enough life, but we didn't go out to restaurants often, and we didn't have a savings yet.\n\nTo help \"pay my way\", I did almost all the cooking and dishes while I was in grad school, more chores around the house, etc. It was way easier on a school schedule to do, and it allowed her way more free time after work, which she deserved for being the breadwinner for a few years.\n\nNow I make almost double what she makes, and I am not keeping track of whether her paycheck covers half the rent or not. We each get a fun money allowance, and we spend the extra on stuff that matters to both of us, such as retirement accounts, saving for vacations we can both go on, etc.\n\nThe main reason I think YTA is because you go on vacations without your partner and force them to focus on something besides school (which has a very real impact on their long term income potential) under the guise of \"fairness.\" I don't think you are trapping Matt, but I do think you dont trust Matt enough to invest in him, and that is a pretty big problem for a long term relationship.", "YTA because it does seem that your boyfriend is financially struggling and you seem indifferent to it. \n\nA mutual friend discussed this with you and your go to was to be indifferent to the concern. \n\nSeems there is a pattern here.", "Hmm. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re financially abusing him.

If he had concerns he should have brought it up with the boyfriend and asked hey are you comfortable with this and then encouraged him to speak to his girlfriend about it. He had zero right to bring up a conversation like with her if anything he deserved to be laughed what he did was extremely uncalled and beyond disrespectful.", "Credit should be given where it\u2019s deserved. Calling your friend a financial abuser (which is quite a serious accusation) without evidence doesn\u2019t quite do it", "OP said that he had the same arrangement with his parents. So while you are right that OP is not a parent here to provide for Matt, Matt technically is being supported by his partner the same way his parents supported him because he doesn't have any more living expenses than he did at his parents.", "My pleasure!", "Jaded as I am and knowing exactly where I am reading and posting, I could have gone for the same unlikely negative options first too. Some part of me still likes trying to see the good in people and not assume malicious intent right away\n\nHell I have a fairly spectacular living arrangement myself that certainly can be taken in the same light so I kinda jump to defend stuff like this when intentions are clearly good. I\u2019m also less inclined to being patient with those making something of nothing. So a nosey git like David annoys me from the start and gets worse from there based on how much they show me they don\u2019t know about whatever they are stirring the pot over", "Wait til you see what happens when users on Reddit show concern that *a woman* might be financially abused and trapped in a relationship. \n\n\"how DARE you call this man an abuser based on a post?\"", "I remain it's still different to be supported by your partner vs parents. Your partner has no obligation, especially when you are together for less than a year.", "\"Your money is ours my money is mine\". Typical user mindset.  \n\n\nWow, she has to pay for a mortgage that isn't actually a cost but an investment in herself.", "Yeah, but also, it has been ten months! Generally I plan vacations six months out. If she does the same, most of these were planned before he was even in the picture. The rest would have been planned before they moved in together. I have a longer relationship with my tennis shoes than these two have.", "He will have known they\u2019ve only been together 9 months though, which is an insanely short timeline for splitting finances", "a 3rd party decided that because he was checking his account before buying things that must mean he's struggling. But he didn't run out of money, and if he had been struggling maybe he would've actually asked OP for help. But he didn't. It sounds like he was just being careful not to go over his budget which is responsible and does not mean OP would not help him out, and aside from the nosy \"friend\" we have no reason to think anybody else was made to feel uncomfortable.", "Yeah absolutely, I agree with you. Just saying in regards to he didn't have expenses before part, he doesn't have any more than now than he did then. And OP is technically supporting him the same way his parents did even though she is way less obligated to.", "It's also an insanely short time-line to move in together.", "Yeah, let's not judge Matt here. lol he hasn't voiced ANY complaints to OP. Matt may be financially struggling, and not all jobs pay well. But even I'm not struggling, but on vacation, I constantly check my funds just to always be on top of my spending. Thought this was normal. Lol", "Could have just been a really expensive meal or something. If my friends decide they want lobster in a trip, I\u2019m going to check my budget, if they just go to a run of the mill restaurant, I\u2019m not bothered."]}
