I like to travel a lot, but Matt can't really afford it, so I mostly go with my friends, but he came with us for a little winter holiday after Christmas. \n\nAfter we got back, one of my friends (David), who was with us too, came to me saying he wants to talk to me about Matt. David told me that he *observed* Matt during our vacation and what I was doing to him really wasn't okay. He saw that Matt was struggling to pay for things, often checking if he had enough money.\n\nDavid eventually said that it's wrong of me to expect Matt to pay for half of everything, since I make so much more than him and the fair thing would be to divide things based on our income percentages. Like I pay for 70% of the things and Matt only pays 30% instead of 50-50.\n\nDavid told me that I'm not *allowing* Matt to save any money of his own, trapping him in our relationship (since Matt couldn't afford to live alone) and that's financially abusive.\n\nI just laughed at David's face. This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. I didn't really try to refute anything he was saying, because none of it made any sense.\n\nDavid got really offended/angry/disappointed or I don't know what, it was kind of hard to read and he said he expected better of me.

I'm thinking maybe I should apologise to David for laughing at him as he really did look concerned, but wtf was he even thinking about... AITA?\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI did make one point to David after laughing, which was that Matt lives with me for free, I only ask for half the utilities, which is less than 50\u20ac a month. I, on the other hand, have a pretty big mortgage. To this, David said that Matt lived with his parents before without having to pay rent, so that's irrelevant and I felt like there wasn't much more to be said.", "created_utc": 1673001668, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104r2vc/aita_for_laughing_in_my_friends_face_because_he/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're both fine with it, that's that. \n\nSecond, you are already paying for waaaay more than 50% when you factor in the mortgage. And while I don't think he should pay for your equity, paying for his own use of utilities is more than fair, and considerably less than he'd be paying anywhere else.

Financial abuse is where you control the money and use that to control the actions and decisions of another person. It's hard to think of how financial abuse could exist between two young able-bodied adults. There has to be other circumstances.  \n\n\nIt occurs frequently in relationships with children, elderly, disabled or people who can't work due to legal or logistical issues. There is  control first and then the finanaces are used to increase that control.    \n\n\nThat said, if you pushed David to go on a trip he can't actually afford, that's not a kind thing to do, but it's not abusive.", "NTA\n\nYour friend gets what he deserves for his ridiculous observations and demand.

Then you can always agree on shifting the payments \"for 1 year because of an academical training\" and then go back to equal splitting.

He had no right to bring it up. Having said that-your dismissive attitude about this is also concerning. I want to clarify that what he was saying is generally true for a married couple who wants to keep finances separate (50-50 is not fruitful-see the numerous other posts on this topic). It is NOT ideal for a couple that is unmarried though, so you are doing the right thing for now at least. If Matt is having trouble keeping up with you, you may want to discuss with him what ways you can adjust together to ensure that you are both financially comfortable.", "NTA.

I'm not entirely sure why this part stood out and bugged me so much. Perhaps it's because we are talking about him being financially struggling and yet, you can afford to go on these trips.

This is the only way I can think of your financial division could be unfair. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I think it would be nice (if you can) to take him with you for 1-2 vacations a year.... that you pay for to surprise him.", "Tell David he is more than welcome to support Matt.", "I was waiting for this big escalation in here but I say NTA. If he can\u2019t afford to live with you and go on vacations then guess what. He doesn\u2019t go. That percentage paying thing may be great for people in a marriage but for two people who are still newly dating no. It\u2019s great that he\u2019s in school part time and hopefully one day he\u2019ll make good money but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to be paying for him. Good luck", "NTA if he doesn\u2019t want to pay anything then he can go back to his parents but if he wants to be a grown ass adult in a grown ass relationship he needs to contribute your friends talking out his ass and clearly doesn\u2019t actually understand what financial abuse is.", "NTA. 90% of the time when someone is crying about financial abuse, it is complete nonsense \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f The only people who think a 50/50 split isn\u2019t fair are parasites", "NTA. To be honest, I felt like David could have a case and I do feel couples should split things according to their earnings, and that other labour is valuable not just work. I.e SAHM getting an allowance when they work 24/7 raising kids and keeping house is crap. But this isn\u2019t that. You and Matt have been together 10 months for god\u2019s sake and more to the point HE DOESN\u2019T PAY RENT. So his contribution is more than fair and lenient. If he doesn\u2019t have money left on holiday, that\u2019s on him. You\u2019re not his mother- Sure, if you guys are going to expensive places whilst on holiday and he\u2019s scrabbling around to buy a meal, you could maybe help him out here and there, but he\u2019s an adult and didn\u2019t have to come and you could go somewhere more budget friendly as a couple. \n\nIt sounds like Dave has heard a buzz phrase and using it wildly.", "NTA of Matt has an issue with the financial split. He can use his big boy words", "[deleted]", "YTA!!!!!\n\nI'm sorry but you seem like a really selfish person. You make more money, so you go on all these trips with friends. But you leave this person that you love, at least I hope you love him, you live together, sitting at home by himself because he doesn't have the money to go. IMO...... I'd never to yhat to someone I love and I'd never kive with someone I didn't love.", "I feel like your friend was told by your partner about these things. \nAlso, you should be talking to your partner in this case + deciding the rent 50\u2105 50\u2105 + utilities would be way less than that. Just living in an apartment for free the best solution would be to sit together and divide the budget + hypothetical rent for it then divide it in half", "YTA. I understand you like to travel and stuff but what is the point in being in a relationship and living together if you arent able to do these things together. Your bf probably feels pressured and wants to do these things with you and is trying to keep up and your friend probably noticed that.", "\\*laughs with you while simultaneously checking my account balance :')\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou have been dating less than a year. \n\nYou provide free housing for your bf. \n\nYou are already contributing more than 50/50 to the relationship. Which at this early on should be more 50/50. \n\nIf your bf can\u2019t afford to pay for his own groceries and his $50 for utilities then he can go back home to his parents. He isn\u2019t your financial responsibility and no this does not equal financial abuse.", "NTA if he moves out he will have to pay all his own groceries, unless his housemates will cook together and a share of the utilities plus his rent and the house won't be that great. He gets you, a nice place and half the bills. It sounds pretty good to me. The percentage share comes in on marriage, not early dating.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d say N A H but he accused you of trapping Matt in your relationship? When he was living with his parents in pretty much the same financial situation before this and could presumably return to that? Nope, there\u2019s concerned and then there\u2019s just making stuff up.\n\nNot to mention that he\u2019s factually incorrect. Matt doesn\u2019t pay rent to live in your home. You\u2019re therefore not going 50/50 at all if you split everything else 50/50.\n\nTell Dave thanks (ish) for caring, but that he\u2019s way out of his lane here.\n\nCheck in with Matt, mention Dave said something, and make sure he\u2019s still cool with your arrangement.", "It also sounds like he isn't paying any rent, only food bills etc so he is already benefiting financially from living with her anyway. But it doesn't seem like Matt has a problem with this arrangement, only David.", "And in such a new relationship, I personally think it would be inappropriate for OP to be subsidising bf's decision to study anyway. That would be red flaggy on his side, expecting a partner of less than a year to support him through study.", "And this\n\n>To this, David said that Matt lived with his parents before without having to pay rent, so that's irrelevant\u2026.\n\nIs utter hogwash. OP is *not* Matt\u2019s mother!", "Both of ours. He lived with his parents and it was a bit too far away.", "That was what stood out to me in neon lights, too.", "I\u2019m with you for the most part, I still gotta say NTA though.  Maybe laughing wasn\u2019t the best response, but it\u2019s kind of understandable since David is overstepping a bit.  It\u2019s commendable to call your friends out when you see something you don\u2019t agree with, to be fair.  But, his concerns are very presumptuous, and he should have anticipated some push back.  \n\nIf he voiced his concerns with the disclaimer that he isn\u2019t part of the relationship and so it\u2019s an outside perspective, and then backed down when she wasn\u2019t receptive\u2026then I would have more sympathy for him.\n\nHe is sticking his nose in someone else\u2019s relationship, I\u2019m assuming, without even confirming that Matt would agree with his assessment\u2026and then he has to the gall to tell OP he expected better from her?  That doesn\u2019t sit right with me.", "And to add, even if he was wrong, OP's friend did something not a lot of people would be able to do - gently brought up a difficult topic of conversation in defense of someone he thought was being taken advantage of/abused. \nHis judgement of the situation seems way off, but I kinda feel like he should get credit for his attempts (unless he was just trying to shit stir)", "This answer if *far* too sensible for a sub that is supposed to be reddit's answer to Jerry Springer!  \n\n\n(Joking aside, I agree)", "I agree with this completely.", "Hypothetical situation here: Let\u2019s say you were earning net 100k and your so was only earning net 20k, and your joint outgoings are 40k. Would you still insist on 50/50? Even if that meant they were using 100% of their income to your 20%? Because that to me sounds like abuse. In this made up scenario, if you both put 35% of your income in, then your outgoings would all be met, and both of you would have money to save for the future and any optional expenses. That is an equitable split. Otherwise you are crippling your SO for what?", "I think if both are fine with it, they can have whatever they want \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSure he should habe some financial autonomy.\nBut if he could go back to his parents he isn\u2019t trapped. And he could have said no. And also he could negotiate the terms himself?", "> dont let his friends gaslight you. you worked hard to study and slave at your job. whether you are male or female, it should be a 50/50 split unless your partner is simply a golddigger...\n\nSo first it's her friend not the bf friend. Secondly please learn what gaslighting actually is before using that term.", "I think David is OP\u2019s actual friend, and likely her boyfriend\u2019s acquaintance. It isn\u2019t his business, but it makes sense he\u2019d go to her first imo", "If OPs bf has no money after only paying for their own food and part of the utilities (less than $50) then the bf needs to have a hard look at their finances and cut back since they aren\u2019t even paying rent. \n\nTechnically OP is paying more than 50/50 since they are covering the entirety of the mortgage and not charging the bf rent.", "But it's NOT an even 50/50 split. OP is paying for the flat, likely on a mortgage unless she got super lucky, and Matt isn't paying any rent, just half of utilities, his own groceries, and his part of nights out. \n\nThis was also a trip that Matt had to pay for, so he likely chose to make sacrifices so that he could afford it - obviously he didn't ask OP for help, otherwise she would have known he was short. \n\nOP sucks for laughing but if Matt discussed this with his friend BEFORE OP, then that makes Matt the AH and Matt's friend is the AH for trying to dictate the financials of someone else.", "She still has to pay the mortgage in your scenario while he does not have to pay rent.", "But it is not actually 50/50 as the boyfriend doesn\u2019t pay rent. Also shared finances after not even a year together would be very fast forward.", "Oh look, it's finantial abuse for an adult to pay a portion of the utilities where they live for free. Somebody call the cops, looks like I've been abused my entire life!", "Is it? They are not married, usually married or long term couples who don't share finances choose to split expenon an equal percentage rather than 50-50. Another point of view is that he is taking advantage of her, using her for her money. Dating her so he can afford to live,  not because he wants to be with her...", "It\u2019s not abuse - because OP would be happy for her boyfriend to go & earn more money. \n\nBoyfriend is welcome to move back to living for free with mummy & daddy if he wants to save more money. \n\nFinancial abuse is when one partner *actively prevents* the other partner from generating an income / having access to money. \n\nSounds like boyfriend made their own choice to go to school & work a lower paying job. How is that abusive?", ">while I do agree with David on both the percentages thing and it being financial abuse\n\nThe man doesn't pay any rent, just a small bill for utilities, this is not financial abuse.", "since when did accusing other people of financial abuse automatically mean that it is well-meant? Are u David? It's very weird to say David had good intentions when he immediately jumped to \"financial abuse\"", "I kinda agree. In this case I don't think Davids concerns were warranted, but they were genuine and I do think the situation he described could indeed be problematic. Even if that isn't the case right here, I don't like the fact that \"none of it made any sense\" to OP. So if the situation develops into what David was concerned about, OP still wouldn't see a problem?\n\nSo, Y-T-A for laughing, but I actually say ESH since David seemed to jump into too harsh conclusions and accusations instead of just politely stating concerns.", "I agree. No one had mentioned this but all I could think was that i can't imagining regularly swanning off on holiday's with my friends that my partner wasn't able to afford. Ok going away with friends and no partner sometimes is healthy but I can't imagine leaving them at home simply because they can't afford it. It must feel really shitty for him. He's trying to study so he can get a better paying job in the future and a partnership which you have already decided is serious enough to live together is about sharing a life for the most part. I would either pay for my partner to come and never use it as leverage or mention it again in arguments or I would not go away as much while he's studying and can't afford it.", "[deleted]", "Is the paying so much more? He is paying no rent at all.

Now at just 10 months into the relationship it isn't a massive deal but there is a point where choosing to just leave your SO at home when you go off traveling becomes a dick thing to do.", "You are making an awful lot of assumptions here.\n\nNone of the food we ate cost more than 7-15\u20ac. The whole trip cost less than 250\u20ac/person. Matt didn't complain, when we came home he said he was surprised how much money he had left, because he was prepared to spend around 375\u20ac.", "Found David.", "Was he living there free? He chose to be in a situation where he would be struggling for money?", "Yeah if someone called me an abuser after assuming things about private matters like my finances... I'd have a lot worse response than laughing. I'd be telliing them that making those kind of serious accusations over an assumption is a dick move, to mind their business, and not talk to them anymore.", "That's true but OP's friend shouldn't have jumped to the idea of financial abuse before knowing all the details. So it was absolutely not 'gently brought up'. And saying the no rent point is irrelevant shows he just wanted to shit stir here.", "Does this really apply when he\u2019s so wrong, though? I get we want people to speak up for the oppressed and abused, but when people butt in when it\u2019s so obviously not abuse, doesn\u2019t it work against people who are actually being abused? Complaining because your friend is only getting free rent and not all kinds of other stuff free too is so far from abuse that it seems like it\u2019s taking away meaning from the term.", "For someone you've been dating for 10 months? Yeah.", "I posted this before she made the edit.\n\nNTA.", "YTA - you invited him on vacation and he couldn\u2019t afford to do outing or restaurants. It was so obvious that your friend group notice. You dont Have to take him on vacations but if you invite him how can you not notice or understand your partner is financially struggling.

Either them being unmarried matters or it doesn't. \n\n>Dating her so he can afford to live, not because he wants to be with her...\n\nHe can't afford to live being with her evidently.", "\"financial abuse\" was not the only thing covered in the conversation.

So..Yeah, I'd say that is good-intentioned", "I don't think OP is an AH right now, since they have only been together 5 months, but I also don't see how the relationship is sustainable long term if one partner earns much more than the other, loves to travel  often and leaves on trips without the other one.", "She pays a mortgage on a property that she owns in it's entirety.\n\nShe would be paying that whether or not he lived there and arguably expecting him to contribute toward the purchase of her house when he has no stake in it is wrong.\n\nShe does not pay rent.", ">He\u2019s not paying any rent or anything towards the mortgage.\n\nWhy should he pay towards her mortgage when he's not on the deed?\n\nIf she wants rent money she can get a tenant or a lodger not a boyfriend.\n\n>If he can\u2019t pay his bills he should stay with mum and dad\n\nEvidently that's what he was doing before he entered the relationship with her and the price of admission was everything he had to pay her general expenses whilst she jets off on holiday.\n\nAwful person and awful for defending her.", "They are mocking you.", "You guys are only 10 months into the relationship, so separate finances make sense. But that is not sustainable long term, if you are going to continue to keep it separate and travel without your partner, while living together.\n\nAt some point you are going to have to ask yourself if you care enough about your partner that it is worth helping him out on the trip finances so you can enjoy together. And if the answer is no, it might be better to end the relationship, or at least have a frank conversation so that both of you understand what you want from this relationship.\n\nIts also possible your partner may be feeling left out or stressed about finances, and your friend may have picked up on it.", "He pretty much had the same arrangement he has with me. No rent, but contributed to the utilities and paid for his own food.", "Did David know that he was getting free rent? My guess is probably not.

Arguably his parents have more reason to support him than his new girlfriend", "Mmmm, it was too much for your friend to call it abuse, but i sure wish I'd had a friend who had asked this question. Splitting costs needs to be really carefully considered when one partner earns much less than the other and this will likely be source of tension if you don't have very open and clear conversations about this regularly.", "Then he first should have talked to his friend to see if the situation warranted him getting involved.", "Last I checked, going out on trips dates etc. Was called living life.\n\nHaving a roof over your head is just survival.", ">I\u2019m not saying he should pay towards her mortgage.\n\nYes you are. Either directly or in terms of \"rent\".\n\nIts your entire argument that he doesn't contribute enough when he is literally contributing so much that he is left with very little at the end of the month and she is able to jet off to exotic locations with her friends.\n\nHe's not living with her for free, he's paying the day to day expenses so that she can continue to feather her nest and that's exploitative.\n\nWhen this is raised with her, she just laughs it off and is abusive to those individuals too.", "They're not splitting costs since she pays the entire mortgage.
