And not just about this incident -- overall.\n\nJamie and Brooke aren't getting along?  Then it's time to sit Jamie down, without Brooke present, and talk with her until you get to the bottom of why Jamie feels this way.  Might take a while.  Might involve some stuff that you don't see as a problem, or that objectively shouldn't be a problem -- but if you start arguing with her while trying to get her to open up, then you'll never actually succeed in getting her to open up.  You need to listen for a while, until you get to the root of whatever the issues are.\n\nNeedless to say, though, you'll also only ever do this if you convince your daughter that you are someone she can talk to honestly, without it getting her in trouble.  And yes, that includes hearing her say things like, \"I don't like Brooke being here, because I wish you were still with Mom.\"  \n\nIs that \"reasonable\"?  No, of course not.  But it's also the key to unlocking some \\*feelings\\*, and it might point to ways that you have failed as a parent.  Failed to explain adequately to your daughter WHY you and your wife divorced, and won't be getting back together.  Why that's not your daughter's fault.  Why Brooke is not replacing Jamie's mom, but yes, Brooke is now a part of the household.  (Don't push onto your daughter the idea that because Brooke moved in, Brooke should now be regarded by Jamie as \"family\".)\n\nIt also very much sounds like you never discussed the idea of Brooke moving in with Jamie before it happened?  While you didn't need to give Jamie the right of refusal, you should have talked to her about how she felt about it, what she thought it meant.  AND, you should have created boundaries from the get go. Who gets to discipline Jamie? (It should only be you, not Brooke.)  Who gets to suggest chores to whom?  (That, IMO, \\*should\\* be both Brooke and you.)  You can't take for granted that everyone has the same understanding of what it means that Brooke lives there now.\n\nIMO, you're right to create a ground-rule that Jamie has to be civil to Brooke, at the very least.  The same, of course, goes for Brooke. (No indication here that Brooke wasn't civil, although we don't know how heated the argument got.)  You should also create ground rules for how the household functions (it's your house and Brooke's house, you are both adults, both of you have the right to ask Jamie to do a chore, within reason).  You and Brooke should get on the same page about HOW to ensure that the parenting of Jamie is left up to you, and Brooke isn't seeming to step in and try to do it.\n\nFrom what you've said, Brooke asking Jamie to do the dishes sounds perfectly reasonable.  It's hard to tell whether Jamie's reaction to it was \"just Jamie being a brat\" (not saying you think that, but it sort of comes across that way), or whether it was a symptom of a larger set of issues that finally erupted over one smallish thing.\n\nHow much of an asshole you are depends on how you go about trying to make yourself into someone your daughter feels she can talk to honestly -- about her fears, her hurt, or her anger -- without you just getting mad at her, or shutting her down, or her getting into trouble for it.  Do you want to be the kind of dad your daughter can confide in?  Then work on that, and maybe you'll be able to get to the bottom of what's wrong between Jamie and Brooke.  You won't really fix anything until you can do that.\n\n(That doesn't mean Jamie calling all the shots, or \"getting rid of\" Brooke, either.  Respecting Jamie's feelings and helping her work through them doesn't have to mean allowing her to do just anything, or allowing her to set the rules.
