None of this is your problem, nor should you have to make any accommodations here. New partner is being insanely jealous and your brother is being a spineless wimp for not just putting an end to the drama.", "NTA. \n\nAnd to be honest, now they've made such a huge deal out of it they're still going to feel the flooding awareness of this ex gf when they notice the bleak empty space where the photo used to be...! The association goes beyond the photo at this point.\n\nIf their relationship is so delicate that a group photo from 6+ years ago in someone else's house is going to wreak havoc then I'm guessing the photo should be the least of their worries.\n\nIt is incredibly rude to ask you to change something in your home, especially something so sentimental. I'd be petty and offer to Photoshop ex gf's face over all the wedding guests' faces but we won't stoop that low..", "NTA, but you should put effort into being one.  \n\nGet the portion with your brother and his ex blown up to portrait size, crop out everyone else in the frame, have it digitally enhanced, frame it, and put it up in place of the original.  Point out how great they looked on that day. Then he'll have a legitimate gripe with you and you can do something to atone for it - like taking down the portrait and putting the full group shot back up in its place.", "NTA: your brother and his ex are not the reason why you have the picture hanging, it was your dream day, you paid for your professional picture with all those people and you shouldn't have to erase history because your brother's relationships didn't work out, also, it's your house. There's no Photoshop strong enough to erase new girlfriend 's insecurities, she should work on that.", "NTA this is very weird. You are not responsible for the insecurities in your brother's relationship. If his fianc\u00e9e can't handle even seeing a picture of him with his ex, they probably shouldn't get married. What an odd thing to be demanding in someone else's home.", "NTA\n\nBro and fiancee need to grow up. Is she just going to pretend old gf never existed - forever?", "While I feel for your brother: it\u2019s your fucking wedding picture and not an image about how happy your brother and his ex were.

Even if you have it photo-shopped, there would still be that space where she once stood and the fiance will still be mad knowing she use to be there. She can chose not to look at the photo.", "NTA: does your brother gf think he was a virgin before she met him? Your brother has a life before they met, and your wedding was part of it.

Your family's reaction to this photo is really weird. The photo captured a moment in time, with 100 people! There is nothing wrong with displaying it.", "NTA - I guess you just need to go back in time and have her step out of the frame for this one.", "NTA. I would have thought differently if it was in a prominent location, but they need to get over themselves.", "NTA if the picture bothers your brother, his fianc\u00e9 and your mom and sister so much they don\u2019t have to go to your house, it\u2019s childish, they can either get over themselves or just not be over.", "NTA\nThe photo has been placed by you in your house because it reminds you of your wedding.

And while I agree that asking for the photo to be taken down is incredibly rude and entitled, your brother may now be doing something that is the opposite - not coming to your house instead of asking you to take down the photo. Short of telling his fianc\u00e9e to not be upset by it or telling her to stay home, accepting the fact that she is upset by it, he may be doing what he thinks is the best thing. May be worth pushing to speak to your brother to find out hats going on - and if it is the photo, whether keeping the photo is worth him skipping, or if you guys are overall fine to disagree and go your separate ways for the holiday.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's your house, your wedding's picture. At some point, your family gotta have to understand that. Would it be nice to them to accommodate them? Sure, but as you said, that would be a major inconvience to you, so they should suck it up.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s really your choice and you\u2019re not wrong regardless of what you decide.

He has no right whatsoever to insist that you edit history to cater to his messy breakup. I've never heard anything so stupid.\n\nEverybody's wedding photos probably have a similar issue. You have a group photo of 100+ people. If you allowed people to bring \"plus ones\", you'll likely have a whole bunch of people in your photos who were only short-term attachments to your relative or friend. Some of them probably broke up in a messy fashion.", "NTA, leave it up.  That picture is your history, and it captures what was going on during your wedding.  Girlfriend-in-law needs to be more secure and deal with it.  Not your problem.", "NTA", "NTA.  This said, there are some very strange dynamics at work here.  If this brother and his girlfriend are making such a mountain about one person in a photo with 100 others, what is going to happen when there is a _real_ crisis?  The deciding factor, as I see it, is not the inconvenience of taking the picture down (it's easy enough to take it off the nail or hanger and stow it for the duration in a spare bedroom) so much as the emotional blackmail.\n\nI'd explore the option of just caving in to their demand not because it is reasonable, but rather to allow the situation to work itself out without your having given anyone a pretext to bear ill will.  I'd frankly be surprised if this relationship lasts long.", "Nta. This is your house not his.", "NTA - since your brother wants it photoshopped, you should do it.

Sit in the kitchen or something. \n\nEven if you agreed to photo shop her out (be careful, he might want to photoshop new fiance *in*) he would need to pay all the additional costs you did to get it to look the way it does currently, and is he really willing to spend that money on a ex?", "NTA \n\nWhat?????  It is 100 people! It is not prominent! It is celebrating you and your husband. \n\nGeez\n\nFrom now on only allow your brother in photos! No partners ever. This will solve all future issues with his partners", "NTA Your brother's new girlfriend sounds really insecure and immature. It's your house and you don't have to change anything.", "NTA - my brother and SIL have their wedding group photo proudly on display in their living room. I was a bridesmaid, my ex-husband was best man. Was it a bad break up? Hoh boy. Yes. Yes it was.\n\nEvery time I visit, I see that picture. I would rather peel my skin off and crawl on my belly through salt and broken glass than look at that photo. I would rather stick my tits in a blender than look at that photo. I would rather stick needles under my fingernails while letting Harvey Weinstein teabag me right between the eyes than look at that photo.\n\nBut would I ever dare ask my brother to take it down? No. Because it's not my picture. It's not my house. It wasn't my wedding.\n\n(P.S. little bro if you ever read this please take down that pic omg please I'm begging you \ud83d\ude02)", "NTA. Jesus Christ, there's having insecurities and then there's whatever this is. This is a photo from SIX years ago. I could understand if this was a photo of JUST your brother and his ex, but it's a massive group photo. This is definitely a bit overboard.", "NTA, they are are being unreasonable. There are people that I hated in school and bullied me but wouldn\u2019t care less if I saw a picture of them and some I have even seen recently and I don\u2019t care, that was a decade and a half ago. Also is she really that insecure? She might need therapy to deal with it if she is", "The problem, though, is that this sets precedence in which brother and insecure fiancee' every outrageous request needs to be catered to keep the peace. Don't do it because they will expect to be favored in all future issues!!", "Your idea is better. I was going to move the photo to a more prominent position. Or print cheap copies of it and put it in all my frames. Or make a huge poster to put on that one blank wall of my house. Yeah. I\u2019m a pill.", "Exactly! As if putting a post it on the ex face would make her go away?! It actually draws the attention! Mmh", "I\u2019d keep offering the carboard cut out (CCO) things at dinner \u201cOh, [ex Gf\u2019s name], would you like some mashed potatoes?\u201d \u201cYou look parched, can I refill your wine?\u201d \u201cPlease let me cut your meat for you\u201d", "This is the way.", "Fair, so it's not about the photo, but the relations behind it. You should tackle these problems (and it could include standing your ground).\n\nBest of luck to you. Maybe have a talk with your husband, could be that he has his own opinion of your family and could help you.", "I like the way you think!", "NTA\n\nIf you are a very caring and nice sister, you'd tell your brother and his GF you'd take down the picture one last time.\n\nIf they bug you about taking it down again, act defeated and give in to their demand.\nJust to have the Ex there in person.\n\nNTA,\n\nif they can't handle the picture they need therapy cause there are deeper concerns in their relationship.", "This is insane.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have a prominent picture of her parents in our living room that was taken on my girlfriend's wedding day when she married her ex-husband.\n\nI have never given a flying fuck that I have a picture from her wedding up in our front room because it's a great picture of her parents.\n\nLeave the picture where it is. It's your house.", "I have been the married person w the photo of an in-laws former bf in a group photo in my house. In my case, no one made issues of my weddings photos. It's a ridiculous thing to do and I would have told them so. She has insecurities she needs to address with herself. And it sounds like there is a possibility your brother is drawn to drama.", "If your brother's fiance is so insecure that she can't handle the fact that he dated before they met their relationship is doomed anyway.", "NTA. If the new fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t handle the memory of the ex to the point that she wants her photoshopped out of someone else\u2019s photo then this relationship is really doomed. Make sure you don\u2019t take any photos with her though, save yourself some trouble with the next overbearing girlfriend.", "NTA. BUT I would go full hog and pull a pretty big prank because I am an AH: hang another photo in place of your large wedding pic (or put up a piece of paper saying \u201cthis space intentionally left blank.\u201d And then replace other photos throughout your house either with pictures of the ex and brother OR photoshop your other photos and reprint so that everyone has the ex\u2019s face.", "NTA. Your brother and his girlfriend clearly have more troubles than their fixation on your wedding group photo. Keep your photo where it is, and your brother will sort himself out in time, with or without this particular girlfriend.", "Yes, because this request is a lot of things, but healthy ain\u2019t one of them", "Christmas cards!", "That's a better idea than mine. I was going to suggest photoshopping in a random face emoji like \ud83d\udc76or \ud83e\uddd2, just over the ex's face but leaving everything else exactly the same.", "This is the delightfully unhinged kinda shit that I just *live* for :D", "NTA their relationship insecurities are not your problem. It has 100 people in it, they need to stop. When I go to my husbands moms house there\u2019s a photo of him with his ex at prom and I looked at it said \u201cthat\u2019s a nice photo\u201d to his mom. The end. Who gives a shit", "Nta. If this is such an issue in their relationship they won't last anyway.", "NTA. Keep your photo up. Your family can come back to your house when they grow up.", "NTA, that is an incredibly childish demand for her to make. Maybe if everyone stops walking on egg shells around her your brother would see what a controlling jealous person he's engaged to and break it off. He's gonna have a hell of a time if he stays with her!", "NTA- Why are people so upset with people having a past. We all do. I mean I understand your position. I recently got a new job and decided to use my actual first and last name on social media. Normally I use my first and middle. But I thought it was more appropriate to use my actual name. My ex husband\u2019s GF lost it and so did he. Saying it was unsettling and really bothered them, it was petty and arrogant. It\u2019s MY LAST NAME. I didn\u2019t realize using my last name was an issue considering we share 3 kids.", "NTA but if your brother really wants that photo down. Tell him how much you paid for it and explain that it's probably going to be at least twice that to get her photoshopped out. At that point if he's serious, tell him you'll only swap the photo when you get the same quality photo back. I wouldn't swap the picture for a lower quality one.", "NTA but if you want to really alter it I would look for someone that does a really good Photoshop work and make them pay the bill keep the original just in case they mess up and if it comes out good start displaying it if it doesn\u2019t keep the original", "NTA, It's your wedding photo. She can get over it and he can, too. It's your wedding, your house, your photo. They don't get a say.", "It seems like the problem is that the brother has his arm around the ex. So get the picture photoshopped, take out the brother, and just leave the ex GF. Problem solved. NTA", "I think OP has something that makes brother uncomfortable when he comes to the house.  OP should just take the photo down when she knows they are coming to visit.  Put the dog in the crate, make a nice meal, take the photo down.  No big deal, and it stops gf and brother from being hurt every time they visit.", "Or brother and fianc\u00e9 can quit going to OP's house.  It's simple to move a photo the few times the brother visits.", "I'd Photoshop another GUY into the photo.  Have brother try explaining that one lol", "Oh. That's choice!!! Almost spit out my drink..", "NTA\n\nIf there are a hundred people in that picture and all they can see is that one person it\u2019s not a problem with the picture.", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 started dating him knowing that he had a previous relationship with a person she doesn\u2019t like. She can\u2019t just pretend away his history but if she wants to, then she just needs to avert her eyes.", "NTA your brother needs to grow the fuck up. Simple.", "NTA, although if you don\u2019t care about the ex-gf you could offer to change the photo if your brother pays fully for the replacement", "NTA, but this is why my family puts the boyfriend or girlfriends at the edge of the photos. Easier to crop out.", "NTA but if you have a digital copy I would be down to shop her out for you, no charge lol\n\nActually, I'd leave her in and shop HIM out so he doesn't have to be seen with her, that'd be funny", "Your home, your photos of your happy day. NTA and don\u2019t cave to her insecurities.", "NTA. It\u2019s a photo from YOUR wedding. Not your fault he and his fianc\u00e9 are that insecure. Sounds like his current relationship is probably not going to work out either. And it\u2019s absolutely none of the rest of your family\u2019s business as well.", "op=nta\n\nthis is a bizarre ask.  He and GF need to get over themselves.  It's in your house--you get to display any picture you want. \n\nDon't let them push you on this.  If he doesn't want to visit. that's on him(at least until he breaks up with this one.)", "NTA. Reasonable people understand that their partners most likely had one or more SOs before they arrived on the scene. This is immature behavior at best, and toxic narcissistic enabling at worst. \n\nIf you take this (perfectly normal, reasonable) picture down, what\u2019s the next request you\u2019re going to have to accommodate? \n\nBoundaries are your friend.", "NTA\n\nAnd if brother has offered to have a new photo created, let him price it out. Maybe that will shut him up.", "People who act this ridiculous are exhausting in a million ways. Your life will become infinitely easier if they choose to escort themselves out of it. Don't budge. NTA.", "See if the original wedding photog will blur out her face & ask your bro to pay for that & have the frame reused/pay for that labor  too.", "NTA and this is exactly why some people choose not to have girlfriends/boyfriends in important photos.", "This is some 1984-level stuff here. Seriously, people need to chill.", "Yes because this photo is the root of ALL their problems (even though they've only apparently been at OP's house twice).", "Right, like take it off the wall, leave the big blank space,  let her ask what was there. Stand in front if it often.", "Literally the point of my post...", "Catholic here, worked for the church for a decade. That is bizarre behavior from your mom.", "This is the way.", "YNTA, they need to grow up and remember that they each had lives before they met.", "Photoshop just their heads a bit bigger than everyone else\u2019s", "NTA this is exactly why some families only allow married couples in fam pics. You should absolutely talk this out w your brother tho", "NTA\n\nYour brother and his gf need counseling to deal with the issue with an photo that wasn't about him and his ex but your wedding", "NTA this is like if it were a graduation photo and wanting it changed because the two students that are dating are not dating anymore", "NTA it's a picture of your wedding day. Its not about them.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't the end of an America's Next Top Model episode where each person who isn't in your life anymore disappears from the image.", "NTA. Don't back down. It's Your House, and that photo is The One You Chose to display in it. Your (and your husbands) choice. This never gets to be your brothers call, his GFs call, or your sisters call. The post-it note is already beyond redicilous, and should be called out and addressed with your sister. They can choose how they decorate their house as they like, and they can choose not to visit you.", "NTA. I can understand your frustration but it\u2019s just honestly not with your emotions.", "Going against the grain, YTA.\n\nRegardless of the new fiancee, your brother had a difficult breakup with his ex and doesn't want her hanging on your wall as a trauma trigger when he's over.\n\nIf he'd asked YOU to pay for her to be photoshopped out, he'd be T A, but he's offered several compromises ranging from temporary (taking it down during an annual holiday visit), to more permanent (but entirely at his expense). You've refused them all and think that because the picture doesn't upset you, he should suck it up sunshine.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not how feelings work, especially after a difficult relationship/breakup.\n\nIf my family kept a picture of my ex on their walls, I wouldn't have been able to go to their house for almost a decade. Despite therapy, meds, and time - it's just not a casual thing I can handle. Likewise, I'm positive that his family have zero pictures of me displayed in their homes, nor did they keep his wedding photos (with his first ex) up once asked to remove them.\n\nYou can be technically right - it's your house, you can have any photo in it that you'd like; and morally wrong, in that you're prioritising your dream photo over your relationship with, and empathy for, your brother.", "Ignore the down votes. I think a lot of these commenters have barely experienced real life.\n\nLook at how much this issue matters to the brother. OP may think it's ridiculous, but his brother's fiance doesn't. What a weird hill for OP to die on. The smallest of gestures, moving a picture for one afternoon, is a bridge too far to defer to his brother's feelings?\n\nI've got two brothers, and OP is definitely the asshole here.", "Or, put it on as the tablecloth/each individual throwaway plate so they have to stare at it through dinner.\n/s\n\nBut I tend to go to extremes.", "First Gen immigrant from poor rural conservative catholic area here.

If I ever have in law troubles I should hire you to help me plot", "NTA - Unfortunately, you don\u2019t seem to have a very respectful family. Between the photo being an issue, to the sister adding a sticky note over it. Completely unacceptable actions. It\u2019s not your fault, and you should not have to feel guilt over the fact that your brother is unable to have a stable relationship like you. Be proud of your life and wedding, especially in your own home.", "Better yet, the cutout should be of the brother and exgf from the offensive photo, with a photo of the fiance's head taped over the exgf...", "NTA. He doesn't get to rewrite your history simply because he doesn't like it.", "NTA, but be careful. I wouldn't trust your family or the new gf around the picture. They already put post it stickers, next time they might decide to do something permanent.", "Omg PLEASE do this!!", "If it was me, I would move it to a prominent place, then put a post it over the ex gf that said \u201cdon\u2019t look under this if you\u2019re insecure\u201d."]}
