I agree with your reasoning here, its a 100 person photo, they can all chill", "NTA and your brother and his fiance need to address the actual issues in their relationship before they get married.", "NTA - He can't rewrite history and if his current partner is mad about his past, then that's an issue they need to deal with. None of this is your problem, nor should you have to make any accommodations here. New partner is being insanely jealous and your brother is being a spineless wimp for not just putting an end to the drama.", "NTA. \n\nAnd to be honest, now they've made such a huge deal out of it they're still going to feel the flooding awareness of this ex gf when they notice the bleak empty space where the photo used to be...! The association goes beyond the photo at this point.\n\nIf their relationship is so delicate that a group photo from 6+ years ago in someone else's house is going to wreak havoc then I'm guessing the photo should be the least of their worries.\n\nIt is incredibly rude to ask you to change something in your home, especially something so sentimental. I'd be petty and offer to Photoshop ex gf's face over all the wedding guests' faces but we won't stoop that low..", "NTA, but you should put effort into being one.  \n\nGet the portion with your brother and his ex blown up to portrait size, crop out everyone else in the frame, have it digitally enhanced, frame it, and put it up in place of the original.  Point out how great they looked on that day. Then he'll have a legitimate gripe with you and you can do something to atone for it - like taking down the portrait and putting the full group shot back up in its place.", "NTA: your brother and his ex are not the reason why you have the picture hanging, it was your dream day, you paid for your professional picture with all those people and you shouldn't have to erase history because your brother's relationships didn't work out, also, it's your house. There's no Photoshop strong enough to erase new girlfriend 's insecurities, she should work on that.", "NTA this is very weird. You are not responsible for the insecurities in your brother's relationship. If his fianc\u00e9e can't handle even seeing a picture of him with his ex, they probably shouldn't get married. What an odd thing to be demanding in someone else's home.", "NTA\n\nBro and fiancee need to grow up. Is she just going to pretend old gf never existed - forever?", "While I feel for your brother: it\u2019s your fucking wedding picture and not an image about how happy your brother and his ex were. If his fianc\u00e9 is so insecure that she can\u2019t handle another persons wedding group shot, she shouldn\u2019t marry that man. NTA", "NTA - And why would you do something so permanent for a relationship like the one between your brother and his fiance when it's DOOMED TO FAIL. If she can't accept the fact that he had a past, and you know the people from his past, then either she's going to remove his family from his life, or they are going to split sometime in the future.", "NTA you absolutely do not have to remove a wedding photo and if that is a huge issue they really need to figure out why it\u2019s a big deal to them", "NTA. Even if you have it photo-shopped, there would still be that space where she once stood and the fiance will still be mad knowing she use to be there. She can chose not to look at the photo.", "NTA: does your brother gf think he was a virgin before she met him? Your brother has a life before they met, and your wedding was part of it. If the gf is so insecure a photo from some distant relation will offend her, perhaps therapy is the better option for her.", "NTA it really doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s a happy picture of your marriage their insecurities are not your problem", "NTA. Your family's reaction to this photo is really weird. The photo captured a moment in time, with 100 people! There is nothing wrong with displaying it.", "NTA - I guess you just need to go back in time and have her step out of the frame for this one.", "NTA. I would have thought differently if it was in a prominent location, but they need to get over themselves.", "NTA if the picture bothers your brother, his fianc\u00e9 and your mom and sister so much they don\u2019t have to go to your house, it\u2019s childish, they can either get over themselves or just not be over.", "NTA\nThe photo has been placed by you in your house because it reminds you of your wedding. It is about you, and not your brother, or even his new girlfriend. They simply do not have a say in how you decorate your place. \nBTW, your brother seems to have a preference for girlfriends that are high maintenance, which is not your duty to enable further.", "NTA. And while I agree that asking for the photo to be taken down is incredibly rude and entitled, your brother may now be doing something that is the opposite - not coming to your house instead of asking you to take down the photo. Short of telling his fianc\u00e9e to not be upset by it or telling her to stay home, accepting the fact that she is upset by it, he may be doing what he thinks is the best thing. May be worth pushing to speak to your brother to find out hats going on - and if it is the photo, whether keeping the photo is worth him skipping, or if you guys are overall fine to disagree and go your separate ways for the holiday.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's your house, your wedding's picture. At some point, your family gotta have to understand that. Would it be nice to them to accommodate them? Sure, but as you said, that would be a major inconvience to you, so they should suck it up.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s really your choice and you\u2019re not wrong regardless of what you decide. If a picture is this much if a hurdle for your brother and his fianc\u00e9 then they\u2019re not going to do well no matter what you do with the picture.", "NTA.\n\nTell your brother where to go. He has no right whatsoever to insist that you edit history to cater to his messy breakup. I've never heard anything so stupid.\n\nEverybody's wedding photos probably have a similar issue. You have a group photo of 100+ people. If you allowed people to bring \"plus ones\", you'll likely have a whole bunch of people in your photos who were only short-term attachments to your relative or friend. Some of them probably broke up in a messy fashion.", "NTA, leave it up.  That picture is your history, and it captures what was going on during your wedding.  Girlfriend-in-law needs to be more secure and deal with it.  Not your problem.", "NTA", "NTA.  This said, there are some very strange dynamics at work here.  If this brother and his girlfriend are making such a mountain about one person in a photo with 100 others, what is going to happen when there is a _real_ crisis?  The deciding factor, as I see it, is not the inconvenience of taking the picture down (it's easy enough to take it off the nail or hanger and stow it for the duration in a spare bedroom) so much as the emotional blackmail.\n\nI'd explore the option of just caving in to their demand not because it is reasonable, but rather to allow the situation to work itself out without your having given anyone a pretext to bear ill will.  I'd frankly be surprised if this relationship lasts long.", "Nta. This is your house not his.", "NTA - since your brother wants it photoshopped, you should do it. Replace every girl's face except for the bride with the ex's.", "INFO: \n\nHow did your brother react (if at all) to the photo during the time period between the end of that old relationship up until the start of this current relationship?", "NTA \n\nFuck off", "NTA.

I\u2019m also guessing that with it featuring over 100 people it\u2019s most likely all the wedding guests. It\u2019s not OPs fault her brother and his ex aren\u2019t together but she shouldn\u2019t have to hide a good meme Roy of her wedding because of this. Especially considering she spent lots of money and time on this particular picture to be able to be hung up.

They need to resolve those insecurities rather than try to get you to change up the decor in your house - you removing that picture clearly will not solve their problems, and that they're acting like it will is absurd.", "Oh, I think you should definitely take it down.

You don't want your brother interfering with your house?\n\nMaybe tell him you will do it, but he has to do x in return. That way you get something out of it and you both can relax. I doubt that your brother likes the situation himself.", "It's one thing to respect their boundaries outside of your house. They have absolutely NO right to set these boundaries for you in your own home over your own wedding photos!! This is not something you need to \"respect\" for them. Truly, it doesn't sound like they should get married if this picture affects their relationship.", "If it's irreplaceable and there's no photo to change to without the ex being involved then you are NTA. It was your special day that cannot be redone, he would've known the consequences if they were to breakup, I say keep the photo up he'll have to suck it up and understand", "I agree, at the end of the day no one can tell OP what can and can't be displayed in her own home. But if a photo upsets your sibling then you should think of taking it down. This is a special case where OP doesn't have a replacement for the photo, so she has clearly thought about it at some point and has even come to a middle ground on some family events, if the photo means a lot which it does as it's her wedding then it should stay up.", "Photoshop pennywise over the BROTHER ex will still be in the picture but she won't be with the brother anymore", "Probably angry because the request is so stupid. My grandma has several of her favorite pics of us at family gatherings (think 20+ people) and some include my mom. It would be ridiculous for my dad's new wife to want her to take down pics because my dad's ex was in it. Who tf cares? Putting a pot-it over her is crazy too. If you are this insecure you don't need to be in a relationship", "That\u2019s a good question actually\u2026 WHY does it make me so angry to have been given this ultimatum (take down the pic or I won\u2019t come to your house)? It\u2019s a number of things I guess. As w most families, we have our sh*t and history of grievances so it\u2019s hard to distill why exactly this cuts so deep when all it would take is about 5 seconds of my time to \u201cresolve\u201d it\u2026\nMaybe one reason is that I did have such a simple wedding: it was in my backyard and my family did not have to spend anything but a few hours on this one day celebrating me. No bridal shower, no bachelorette party, no engagement party, nada. This was my own personal preference and I wouldn\u2019t have changed anything about it. \n\nMy sisters wedding required lots of travel, time, and money\u2026 which I was happy to do and didn\u2019t complain about (save the occasional gripe to my husband).  \nMy brothers wedding is shaping up to be quite the extravaganza w all the bells and whistles\u2026 and again- I am happy to celebrate him and his bride and I think she should have the perfect day of her choosing. \nSo for them to have asked all this of me to celebrate their weddings, it really hurts that they wouldn\u2019t just suck up their own discomfort to let me display a photo of my special day.", "Absolutely agreed here. OP doesn't need to justify her reason for liking that photo at all. Brother and future Sister-In-Law need to grow the heck up."]}
