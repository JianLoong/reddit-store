Afterwards we played her first game. \n\nAt first we were playing it properly and having a lot of fun when she starts picking up the balls and hitting the wrongs ones in. I ignored it because she\u2019s a teenager and I just wanted her to have fun. The fun ended when she started hitting away the ball I was trying to hit on my turn. I told her to stop and she got cross saying \u201cit\u2019s just a joke, it\u2019s funny\u201d. \n\nSoon after I was winning and as she was about to hit the ball in on her turn but she missed. She then quickly grabbed the ball and put it in front of the ball she missed, trying to hit it again. I told her firmly no and to stop because that is against the rules but she didn\u2019t listen. I then yelled \u201cstop it really isn\u2019t funny. I\u2019m not having fun at all\u201d. She left upset and I\u2019m still really angry. Now I think she\u2019s not talking to me. AITA?\n\nShort: My sister keeps cheating at pool so I yelled and she isn\u2019t talking to me. AITA?\n\nEdit; Hey guys thank you for the comments! Me and my sister are good friends and all I wanted was to post something on here for the first time about a small issue I had. Thank you to the people who have gave me advice! I wasn\u2019t trying to be to serious with this since it\u2019s just a game but thanks to some of you I know how to communicate better with her. I do appreciate you guys <33", "created_utc": 1674113554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fvpin/aita_for_not_wanting_to_change_the_rules_of_pool/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The hitting away your ball is just a harmless prank. Sure that's annoying, but she is just trying to have fun with you. Playing seriously when you are a beginner against someone that is better than you is not very fun. I however draw the line at moving balls and getting extra tries without permission from everyone.\n\nThat said I would probably recommend not playing a serious game with her. Maybe practice making more difficult shots. Or making up games with different rules. Try and find something both of you would enjoy", "NTA, 15 is old enough to play by the rules and learn some sportsmanship.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is 15, not five. so AGREE on the rules you use. And then decide if you want to play with her or not.", "This is a tough one.  On the surface, it seems that sister is TA because you had already told her to stop, more than once, and she didn't listen.\n\nBut, sometimes younger ones will do childish things like this as a way to reconnect with their older siblings in a youthful way, making up games etc.", "Next time play krud... It's fun and less serious then pool. You aren't really the AH but I think lower your expectations, sounds like your sister wasn't in the mood for a serious game.", "NAH, she might\u2019ve just wanted to tease you by not doing what you say, but didn\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be that pissed about it. It seems you guys just wanted different things, you wanted a serious game and she just wanted to have fun", "Soft YTA. Pool, to filthy casuals like me, is about \"hit ball go clack, maybe ball go in hole?\" and it sounds like you were taking it way more seriously than your sister. Heck even when I play with friends who are regulars, we'll still fuck around and bend rules because it makes the game more enjoyable and forgiving to rookies.\nYour situation is just a case of miscommunication, there's no need to yell.", "\"she\u2019s a teenager\"\n\nlol like you aren't.", "ESH, kinda.\n\nYou really need to lighten up a bit. You may be 18 but she's just a few years behind her and the way you write this tale, you're lording over her like you're some superior being.\n\nYou're a teenager too and while she may be just trying to have fun, you're parading around like some adult when you're acting more childish than her, just in a totally different way.\n\nLighten up Francis.", " YTA you two could have just had fun and worked on how to shoot well instead of immediately jumping into a serious game. Way to blow a bonding experience bro", "ESH\nWhat are you yelling for? It\u2019s a game of pool.", "Soft YTA.\n\nTeenagers aren't gracious losers. If your sibling wasn't having fun with the game and was sabotaging it on purpose, you could have stopped the game right there. The outburst was a bit much imo.", "NTA. She is 15, not 3. You would be doing her a lifelong disservice to treat her anything other than her age. The game has rules. So does life.", "If your sister was ten, then sure, YTA.\n\nBut she's not, she's fifteen, and yet she's behaving like a ten year old.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Next time try playing a game where you know both of you will have fun while still sticking to the rules.", "I think once she got the wrong ball in, you should have stated it is a practice game. That way, your sister could have got her fun out. The next game state this is a real game. You might not see it now, but times like what you described are memories in the making. No one is the AH, but remember that you have your sister looking up to you. You don't want to look back at these times later in life, wishing you didn't get upset over something like this.", "A soft ESH (you for throwing her in at the deep end, she for letting her frustration out the way she did). .\nPerhaps going straight from learning the rules to a game taken seriously was a big step.\n\nWhen I started (and to some extent, to this day because I don't play often), things like bank shots and backspin were challenging to the point of frustration. Maybe start by just knocking the balls around", "Just don't play with her.", "Frankly, when I was growing up with my younger sisters, I would not give two shits about this kind of behavior. I might start by trying to teach them how to play a game by the actual rules, but if they made it clear they did not want to learn, I'd quickly abandon the idea and be silly with them. But I was 7 and 11 years older than my sisters, and I think that made it harder to faze me.\n\nYTA. Yelling was unnecessary. She was just trying to have fun with you. Learn to regulate your emotions. The game might not be fun for you if she doesn't play by the rules, but it's probably not fun for her either to play against someone with much more experience than her.", "YTA. \n\nHitting the ball you would hit on your next turn isn't cheating. It's good pool.", "YTA. How old are you? You sound like a pair of 10 yr old siblings squabbling. Don't bother us with this nonsense.", "NTA, she's a brat. 15 is old enough to understand rules.", "Soft YTA, she was the real A. You wanted to play competitively. She was losing and decided to antagonize you instead of finishing the game. She wins this round, she got out of losing *and* got under your skin. You don\u2019t have to play with her. Some people never learn to appreciate playing against a challenging opponent, it just makes them mad.", "NTA. If she wants to play the game, she can play by the rules. She's far too old to be doing this, and no-one else is going to put up with it.", "Thank you this is super helpful! I also think we I\u2019m too used to playing a serious game against others so it was hard for me to play against her when she was playing pranks like that. She does it alot in other games and it gets on my nerves a bit.", ">Lighten up Francis.\n\nStripes, great reference!!   \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H-Cs-fi5tA&t=4s&ab\\_channel=filmstripguy", "That\u2019s very true. Thank you for that.", "My sister always seems to change the rules on a lot of the games we play. I reckon I should have been a bit more aware of that when trying to play with her", "I wouldn\u2019t play any game with her unless you have decided ahead of time that the rules don\u2019t really matter. Getting in the right headspace to expect the behavior you\u2019ve seen before will help. You can\u2019t control other people, you can only control yourself. I know it\u2019s harder with a sibling than almost anyone else. She is your equal and you\u2019ve been living together and competing on some unconscious biological level your entire lives. I\u2019ll tell you what I tell my stepdaughter when she is annoyed with her little brother - \u201cwhen he outgrows being annoying, he could be the best friend you\u2019ve ever dreamed of having.\u201d And then I list off all of the famous people who made a career with their sibling(s). It helps, sometimes."]}
