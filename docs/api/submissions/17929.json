{"id": 17929, "submission_id": "13p1zpk", "title": "AITA for expecting my boyfriend to pay rent if he moves in with me", "selftext": "This is a doozy. I\u2019ve been dating Josh for a year. I should say now that I (24f) don\u2019t ever want to be legally married, and Josh (30m) is divorced and doesn\u2019t want to remarry. We also live in a place where there is no common law marriage. \n\nStill, we want to take things a bit further and we\u2019re talking about Josh and his two daughters moving in with me. I own a 3 bed 2 bad house in a nice area. Josh rents a 2 bed one bath apartment, and his lease is coming up. My mortgage is 1k a month, and Josh\u2019s rent is 1.4k a month. \n\nIt was important to me that we would have everything figured out before making the change so that there would be no surprises or disagreements about who pays what. \n\n\nI figured it would be unreasonable for Josh to expect to just live with me for free, especially since I\u2019d be giving up one of my rooms so his daughters could have a room. I suggested that Josh pay 700$ a month to me in rent, half a what he is currently paying. I would cover the cost of any home repairs, internet, garbage, etc. Then we would split utilities, even though there\u2019s three of them and one of me I don\u2019t mind splitting since that would be about what I\u2019m currently paying I predict. And since I meal prep once a week I would just get my own groceries and he could get theirs. \n\nWhen I laid everything out Josh was very unhappy, and said since it\u2019s my house he shouldn\u2019t have to pay rent, and that we should split groceries. \n\nI told him he was welcome to buy his own house and I would move in with him and happily pay rent, while renting out my own house. He was mad at me because he said he\u2019s not in a position where he can buy a house. \n\nWe can\u2019t come to an agreement, so I suggested he just find another apartment (the owners aren\u2019t letting him renew) and we could revisit the topic in a year. He\u2019s not happy with that either because rent prices have skyrocketed here and 2 bedrooms now go for around 1.8k a month, and he thinks he won\u2019t be able to find a place he can afford. \n\nI\u2019m a bit frustrated because I feel like 700$ a month is a really good deal compared to the likely 1,800$ he will have to pay. Since we aren\u2019t going to get married or anything I don\u2019t understand why he thinks I would be okay with him living for free with his two kids. I\u2019m happy to have romance and companionship but shared assets and finances are not something I want in life, I don\u2019t want to support a man. \n\nAITA for expecting my boyfriend to pay rent?\n\nEdit: i showed Josh this post and he thinks you all are wrong. So here\u2019s some input from him:\n\u201c Leslie makes 120k a year and I make 30k a year. I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck supporting two kids with no help from my ex wife. It\u2019s gotten so expensive here that at this rate I\u2019m not even going to be able to feed my kids soon without going to the food bank. No matter what, they\u2019re going to get fed. But it\u2019s not fair that she owns a house, and can go on vacations or spend 400$ a month getting her hair done when I can\u2019t even buy my kids name brand cereal. She shouldn\u2019t charge me to live with her because she should understand that I want to be able to spend whatever I can giving my kids the childhood that they deserve. Not for me, but for them.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: thanks Reddit. Owe you one and I\u2019m glad I posted here. After a very loud and angry argument with Josh, I broke up with him. Despite pretty much everyone telling him he was wrong Josh insisted that I should basically support the three of them because it\u2019s what would be best for his kids. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that they aren\u2019t my kids and no one is going to want to bankroll the three of them. At least no one with a brain. \n\nThe point is, I\u2019m young, goodlooking, i own a house. I can do better than a broke single dad who has no education and a shitty job who thinks it\u2019s ok to mooch off me and scream in my face when I tell him no. Hope your next girlfriend is stupid enough to put up with you Josh \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb.

You'll occasionally help with the kids, but he's still primarily responsible for his own kids and shouldn't expect you to make family dinner or stay home when the kids are sick, etc...\n\nUltimately, though, it's pretty obvious that this guy wants someone to play Mommy to both him and his kids.  If he wants you to give him free housing, he probably also expects you to do all the grocery shopping, cook dinners, and watch his kids.\n\nSeparate homes and dating would help you maintain the independence that you want.

I\u2019ve been dating Josh for a year. I should say now that I (24f) don\u2019t ever want to be legally married, and Josh (30m) is divorced and doesn\u2019t want to remarry. We also live in a place where there is no common law marriage. \n\nStill, we want to take things a bit further and we\u2019re talking about Josh and his two daughters moving in with me. I own a 3 bed 2 bad house in a nice area. Josh rents a 2 bed one bath apartment, and his lease is coming up. My mortgage is 1k a month, and Josh\u2019s rent is 1.4k a month. \n\nIt was important to me that we would have everything figured out before making the change so that there would be no surprises or disagreements about who pays what. \n\n\nI figured it would be unreasonable for Josh to expect to just live with me for free, especially since I\u2019d be giving up one of my rooms so his daughters could have a room. I suggested that Josh pay 700$ a month to me in rent, half a what he is currently paying. I would cover the cost of any home repairs, internet, garbage, etc. Then we would split utilities, even though there\u2019s three of them and one of me I don\u2019t mind splitting since that would be about what I\u2019m currently paying I predict. And since I meal prep once a week I would just get my own groceries and he could get theirs. \n\nWhen I laid everything out Josh was very unhappy, and said since it\u2019s my house he shouldn\u2019t have to pay rent, and that we should split groceries. \n\nI told him he was welcome to buy his own house and I would move in with him and happily pay rent, while renting out my own house. He was mad at me because he said he\u2019s not in a position where he can buy a house. \n\nWe can\u2019t come to an agreement, so I suggested he just find another apartment (the owners aren\u2019t letting him renew) and we could revisit the topic in a year. He\u2019s not happy with that either because rent prices have skyrocketed here and 2 bedrooms now go for around 1.8k a month, and he thinks he won\u2019t be able to find a place he can afford. \n\nI\u2019m a bit frustrated because I feel like 700$ a month is a really good deal compared to the likely 1,800$ he will have to pay. Since we aren\u2019t going to get married or anything I don\u2019t understand why he thinks I would be okay with him living for free with his two kids. I\u2019m happy to have romance and companionship but shared assets and finances are not something I want in life, I don\u2019t want to support a man. \n\nAITA for expecting my boyfriend to pay rent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\nHonestly for this it doesn\u2019t matter that you make more than him or that he has kids to support. You\u2019re not married, you\u2019ve only been dating a year. Even at $700 a month the dude isn\u2019t spending 1/3 of his income on rent and is saving money compared to before. I\u2019ve paid $1200 for myself on less than that income, I am very familiar with that pain, but it doesn\u2019t give me a right to free room and cheap board with my partner. It\u2019s a partnership, and you\u2019re not his mother obligated to house and feed him.  Particularly since the dude is lucking out on utilities, those are going to treble.", "NTA. The fact that he is raising his kids on his own is not your problem. He needs to go after their mother for financial support through the legal process. Regardless, that is YOUR money and your house. He isn\u2019t entitled to anything. His options are continue to live strapped for cash OR choose the option that saves him money and provides him and his kids with a better living option. \n\nThe questions for you:\n1. Do you want to be with someone that clearly sees the inequality in income as an opportunity for themselves to spend less, do less? I mean he even says in his comment that why should *you* get to spend $400 on your hair\u2026 and the answer is, because it\u2019s YOUR money. He obviously sees that he\u2019s allowed to throw around his opinions about how you spend your money, but he doesn\u2019t want to pay his own way even though it\u2019s less than what he\u2019s paying now. \n\n2. Are you sure you want to become a de facto step parent to these kids? You will at some point be expected to foot the bill financially for them whether that is food, after school activities, clothing, etc.", "NTA - I'm sympathetic to his situation, but it's unreasonable for him to expect you to, effectively, subsidize his and his daughters' lives. At this point, even if he agreed to your terms, I wouldn't let him move in. How long do you think it would be before he started making excuses for why he couldn't pay rent that month? Or asked you to help out with their food or other expenses just because you can afford it. I think it would be naive to think they could start living with you, but everything that you care about wouldn't change. I'm sure he is a good guy just trying to do the best he can for his family, but I think you need to find a different fuck buddy whose life is more compatible with yours.", "NTA. You are 24. Do not subsidize your bf. Move on.", "NTA and honestly his update makes it worse.  He will be up $1100 a month (basing on the $1800 increased rent he expects to pay) and saving on bills too.  His ex doesn't give him anything but you should? Much wants more as they say.\n\nNot only should you not let him move in but you should dump this greedy user too", "Me, I would definitely have a formal written lease agreement with Josh. Have everything in writing on how things will play out if the relationship changes. \n\nAlso, when you two adults are together, ALL expenses should be split equally. I say this because utility bills will increase with 3 more people, repairs are going to have to happen with more wear and tear on appliances and the place, groceries will never be kept separate because humans eat what they find when hungry, and your housework work-load will increase tremendously. \n\nNTA, for being cautious. Take care of yourself. He is waving red flags, trying to take advantage of your generosity and getting free help raising his children. Be smart and cover your butt. He just pushed the issue to see how easy of a pushover you are. Also, don\u2019t feel guilty about earning more money than him. You are doing him a huge favor by letting him and his family move in. You both know he can\u2019t afford a house or rent on his own.", "RUN AWAY. Not your monkeys. This guy is a victim looking for his next victim. RUN AWAY faster.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP, you seem to be an intelligent, well reasoned, sensible individual who is being preyed on by a leech.  Your update just makes it all the worse, he\u2019s said the quiet part out loud, he expects you to support him and his kids because he\u2019s not going to be doing it himself.  He\u2019s a leech.", "Even after the update, NTA. \nSeems like he wants to leech off of you to be able to take care of his kids instead of bucking up and taking full responsibility", "NTA but partner is. He wants to live rent free and you support him and his kids so he can spend his money on his kids. $700 is almost nothing compared to what he would have to pay if living in an apartment. Either pay the rent and splits utilities and buy your own groceries or he can find an apartment. Stand your ground. He wants to use you", "NTA and your boyfriend\u2019s response makes it very clear that he is trying to get you to support him. With the best of intentions\u2014 he wants to provide a better life for his kids\u2014 but he is still trying to claim your money and property as things he and his children are entitled to.", "NTA\nEspecially with the edit. Him having 2 kids to take care of is not your problem. It\u2019s his. He doesn\u2019t get a free ride on rent just because he has kids to take care of.", "NTA\n\nAs a parent, I understand Josh wanting to to his best for his kids. However, he should expect to retain full responsibility for their expenses. His proposal is not equitable. Frankly, I think he\u2019s an AH for proposing to move his kids into a situation with someone who is not prepared to be a stepparent or form a family. And he definitely should be actively looking for ways to increase his income. It\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not easy, but he needs to do it.\n\nYou should not underestimate how difficult it is to live in a shared household with children, and build a life together, without blending expenses and responsibilities to some extent. You\u2019ll buy your own groceries\u2014does that mean the four of you will not cook or eat meals together, or host family and friends together? How will you deal when Josh needs to leave the house and you\u2019re alone with the kids? \n\nThis whole thing is a setup for disaster\u2014with helpless kids as collateral damage. You can find romance and companionship with someone who isn\u2019t setting you up from the outset to bankroll his parenting commitments.", "With that update, I\u2019d be thinking about ending the relationship altogether. You are not responsible for sheltering, feeding and clothing *his* children.", "ESH. You two shouldn't be dating. You have obvious commitment issues, and he has *children.* this isn't fair to them. Go ahead and break up with him cuz your little \"just roommates but also romantic but not super serious\" thing isn't gonna work.", "You're dating a hobosexual. Stick to your guns. He's trying to mooch off you.", "From how you write it seems to me more like a business deal than a romantic relationship. \nI find it weird that you charge rent to the person moving in, if you have no mortgage. (i understand you don\u2018t have it). If you pay mortgage then paying rent makes perfect sense + division \n of any other costs. \nWhere I am from the person moving in would not pay rent but would equally contribute to all the costs (or even more since 3\nPeople are moving in). But only if you fully own it and no loans. \nFor the food part \u2026 again\u2026 if he is moving in I see that as forming a family so I find it also weird to do it separately. Also, there are plenty of apps to track expenses and then settle up at the end of the month. No need to share finances, at all. ESH", "Gross. Saw the edit. Hey Josh, it\u2019s not your girlfriend\u2019s responsibility to support you and your children. That\u2019s entirely on you big boy. Time to grow up.", "Do not let him move in.\n\nBut, if you do, make him sign a rental agreement, so when you inevitably have to take him to court for missing payments, you'll have a paper trail. \n\nNTA, unless you let him move in.\n\nAll that said, in your shoes I'd have offered a percentage split based on salary.

I", "Oh hell no, I didn't come into this until the edit, and this guy sounds like an incredible mooch. He was expecting you to become his new meal ticket. I would bet money the great sex would stop the second you let him and his kids move in - either because he was love bombing leading up to tricking you into being his sugar mama, or because he'd saddle you with his wild kids and you would grow resentful and not want to sleep with him anymore.\n\nYou say his current landlord is refusing to renew. Do you have proof of that? Who suggested you live together?\n\nNTA. DO NOT let this guy and his kids move in. Find a new boyfriend.", "Don\u2019t let him move in.  This is just the tip of the iceberg!  He wants you to pay for all the living expenses because of his kids. Next thing he will want you to pay vacations, phones and computers \u201dfor the Kids\u201d because they deserve that type of childhood.", "Slight YTA here from me after seeing the edit in the OP regarding income comparison. I understand OP wants to have her partner pay their share, but their share probably shouldn't be 70% of the running morgage if they only make 20% of the combined income and have reasonable responsibilities with 2 kids. So I would suggest a 200$ participation in the morgage might be reasonable, other expenses to be discussed.", "Omg. After reading Josh\u2019s response I\u2019m gonna say. Dump the Asshole. Don\u2019t let him move in.", "INFO: Where are you getting the number of $700 from? Is it just because this is half of what your BF currently pays in rent, or did you calculate this based off specific expenses?\n\nThis is heavily unpopular, but I can see YTA or ESH here for asking him to pay \"rent.\" If he is going to live with you he needs to contribute fairly in a financial sense, but charging your partner \"rent\" is not the same as asking for them to pay their share of bills. It's fair to ask him to split utilities, internet, garbage, and those things, but it is NOT fair to ask him for money for the mortgage or household repairs.\n\nThe house is an asset that is only ever going to belong to you. The equity you build in this property is only ever going to belong to you since you do not ever intend to marry and you are not in a common law state. Josh effectively will never have a stake in your house because of this, which is perfectly fine. However, because he will never have a stake it's not really fair to charge him a flat rent of rent, and then turn around and use this for expenses like mortgage, or household repairs. Those are costs to own and maintain your asset. Josh does not own nor will be ever own, any part or portion of your asset. \n\nSo again, he should foot expenses to contribute to the household, but you shouldn't be taking his money and using it to put in a new deck or replace an old water heater or something like that. That's not really ethical or fair to him, since he has no stake in the home. He really should only be paying expenses like utilities, cable, internet, etc. \n\nNow, going back to the idea of \"rent.\" If you are charging him $700 based solely on the fact that this is half of what he currently pays now, you are really just charging him an arbitrary expense that you may or may not actually have. i.e., you said you would use it for repairs. Okay, so what if you don't have any repairs at all for the duration of a year? Does that just become pocket money for you, or would you put it to the mortgage? It's not an actual expense you have right now. It's a fee you want to charge him for the privilege of living with you.\n\nSure, you could say it's the cost to occupy the space (this is what rent is), but then you are invoking a landlord/tenant relationship. I'd ask yourself if this is something you really want to do. It can cause a lot of strife in a relationship when one person holds power over the other in this way. It also seems like it's something that is already causing issues for you, since you can't agree on a fair amount for the \"rent.\"\n\nTo sum it up, it's fair to charge him for expenses such as utilities, but I think charging your partner a flat rate of rent based on no real numbers is unfair. If that's what you want to do, you're invoking a landlord/tenant relationship. If that's really want you want, you should get a lawyer and get an official lease agreement drawn up that reserves rights for each of you as landlord and tenant respectively.", "If you move that family in, you may go through a great deal or drama to ever get them out. This man seems to expect you to pay for the children he created with another woman. You aren\u2019t interested in marriage. He\u2019s not interested in a partnership.

NTA regardless) I would put on the table that you could charge rent and let the money go into trust funds for his kids education. \n\nThat way he can't say no on the basis of wanting to help his daughters. I do not know your husband which is why I can't tell you if he is a leech or if he is just genuinely terrified for his daughters future and desperation clouded his judgement(neither can all the other people here as much as they would like to believe otherwise).

I mean, our property tax bill is thousands a year, plus insurance - that has 0 to do with mortgage but is required to live somewhere. What about utilities?", "So he\u2019s allowed to profit by having no rent but she\u2019s not allowed to save more money when she has 3 more people in her house? Currently paying rent he is getting no equity in his landlord\u2019s building. No different paying rent to her, except it\u2019s literally half as much money out of his pocket! He will be saving almost $9K a year living with her. That is a lot of non-generic cereal for his kids", "On the size of her house of course depending on age a couple of k per year is nothing weird. Then think about things like property tax (I assume that is a thing over there as well). Owning a house costs a lot more than the mortage.", "Completely - not to forget she\u2019s actively building equity, the value of the home is increasing and it\u2019s his money that will be going towards that, which he won\u2019t be seeing the positive side of.", "Omg, agree! I was on the fence until this comment chain. ESH except the kids. I think if it was an actual serious relationship where she was willing to be involved with the kids, fine. If it was a truly platonic roommate situation, fine. But this in between shit is too unsteady a situation for these poor kids who already had their lives turned upside down once when their parents divorced.\n\nWhy would you even get into a relationship with somebody with kids if you are so completely disinterested in playing any role in the children's lives? Why is he, as the FATHER of these kids, okay with that?", "I don\u2019t feel like living together had to be serious, not like we\u2019d even have a joint bank account or even a dog together.", "How is it awkward and selfish? We would both save money, and I would treat his kids well. I just wouldn\u2019t be disciplining them or doing any of the serious parenting. His kids could have a better life, go to a better school, live in a better neighbor, have nicer things, a positive female role model, etc. I don\u2019t want to be called mommy or anything but yeah, not trying to be some wicked stepmothetb", "So she should pay for him and his kids to live for free? Get out of here with that! He's not her husband and they are not her kids. He would already be saving substantial money only paying $700 a month. You don't live anywhere for free! And it's not someone else's job to take care of you and your kids. NTA. Do not let him move in! Let him leech off someone else. If he wants better for his kids, that's his burden not yours.", "She\u2019s also cutting him slack on utility costs, by splitting those equally rather than him paying what him & his kids will use.", "He IS saving up money, he\u2019s saving $700-800 a month by not paying the fair market value of rent. Why should he and his kids live completely rent free when he\u2019s already halves his housing costs?", "I honestly can\u2019t blame her. The edit he had her post talking about how she could afford it. Talking about vacations and how much she spends on her hair. To me he is wanting her to bank roll his lifestyle", "She just updated saying she dumped him after he screamed in her face for saying no.\n\nReddit saves the day !\n\nDam hobosexuals.", "Difference is your married and they are his kids. Where as they are only living together and they are not her kids.\n\nI am a stay at home spouse. I used to be a stay at home mom but kids grew up. My husband always supported me. But never before we where married and I worked until I had kids.", "I am in a very low cost of living state. To get my hair cut and colored it\u2019s right at $200. So It not like she is having something extravagant done. Also in a high cost of living state $120 k a year isn\u2019t bat but she isn\u2019t high rolling either.\n\n\nGo read her edit. He actually told her that supporting him and the kids was what s best for them. Apparently they broke up. She dodged a bullet.", "Sound like he\u2019s just starting to show you his true colours and expectations. I think your idea of waiting is spot on. The fact that he\u2019s bitching about is all from him no getting his own way and it\u2019ll probably just get worse.", "Well he\u2019s not listening to the outside perspective even though the consensus is clear. That does not bode well at all.", "OP, if you think it's bad now, wait until you're living with someone who does not contribute to living expenses, triples the number of people in your house, and you can't evict them without a lawsuit.\n\nThe \"only disagreement\" = the mask has finally slipped. THIS is who he is. THIS is what he wants, and if you don't give it to him \"it's not fair\".\n\nRun fast, run far.", "The perspective is run from this man.", "Babe, after the edit from his \"post of view\" he sounds like a cry baby leech. \n\nDump him and find a more reasonable guy.", "He could save 700 bucks a month or end up single \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f wooooww he had such a hard choice.      \n\nNta op", "And he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that he\u2019s paying for the privilege of taking up your space, peace and quiet and stability with that $700 either", "Yeah but money is a BIG disagreement. With your agreement, he would be paying way less than 3/4 of the household even though he and his kids make up 3/4 of the household. \n\nIf he is having issues with his ex, he needs to take that up with courts. If he only makes 30k a year, he needs to switch employment. Fast food is hiring at higher starting rates than that. Idk where you live exactly so it might differ, but his money issues arent your issues. But they will be if he moves in.", "He\u2019s looking for a sugar mommy. His response in your edit was all about how life is unfair that you worked hard and are successful and he\u2019s not but \u201cdeserves it\u201d. And how he wants you to foot all the bills so he can spend his money how he wants. Basically what\u2019s yours is his and what\u2019s his is his.\n\nThere is no discussing or negotiating with someone who has flat out said they expect you to support them *and their kids*. If you get him to finally agree to pay, he will 100% be short on his rent and bills until he just decides to quit his job to be a SAHD while you pay for everything. His kids need new clothes? Well you\u2019ll have to skip that $400 hair appointment. Kids need school supplies? That\u2019s on you. Sports and hobbies? You. Next time you are wanting a vacation? Well, you\u2019ll be expected to be paying for 4 people instead of just yourself. \n\nHe told you what he wants and expects. He said nothing about moving in because he loves you. He loves **what you have $$**. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "Yeah people do not realize once they start supporting kids they are on the hook. Family court doesn\u2019t look at biology they only look at what is best for the kid in this situation. Not all states are like this but some do. So I would talk to a lawyer before moving in with someone with kids.\nEspecially someone already looking for a free ride.", "Living together is *always* serious when children are involved. If you aren\u2019t prepared to be serious, you should not do it.", "He is wanting you to bank roll him. If you decide to do this have a iron clad rental agreement drawn up and signed. But honestly I would run. The red flags are massive", "It doesn\u2019t HAVE to be, if you were on the same page about it not being serious and he didn\u2019t have kids. But that\u2019s not the case. Don\u2019t do it to yourself or to him and his kids.", "He will be bringing kids with him. This is not fair to them.", "You will be sharing a house with him and his children? That\u2019s about as serious and in-your-face as a relationship can get, regardless of the legal ties. I\u2019m a bit concerned that you seem to think this is going to be a low-key change without long-term ramifications.", "I think you're discounting how confusing it would be for his kids to watch their father hug and kiss someone who not only isn't their mother, but also isn't their mother *figure*.\n\nIt's fine if you want a fuck buddy to live with you and pay half your bills, but it's a bad idea when kids are involved.", "Clearly, reading comprehension is not your strong suit. It says very clearly in my original comment that he should absolutely pay, and there obviously wasn't enough context to the post. OP should make it more clear that she isn't interested in being a family and that this is completely transactional and convenient for her. I already said he shouldn't move in because it's not fair to the kids, whatever they work out financially. There's nothing wrong with wanting a roommate you can have sex with to save you both some time and money, but don't bring the kids along for the ride.", "No matter what it is a good deal for him, at least best one he could get. Otherwise he is going to pay much more no matter what if on own. Honestly cannot believe he would expect no rent and equal split on groceries", "Yeah 700 $ a month is great but I just mean if he can save the money and find a better job with her support maybe he'll be able to pay a much higher rent so it'll profit both out them in the long run.\n\nIf his solution is soley him living rent-free without a way to change his income it would be a big problem but I don't know if they only talked temporaly or for the long run", "Most satisfying edit in a long time", "I was like WOW.   Good job reddit...", "Ah I must have read common law marriage and assumed marriage.", "Yep. I realized that that\u2019s what it all came down to. While I did waste a year on him I really didn\u2019t waste any money yet thankfully. From now on I\u2019m only gonna date dudes who make the same amount of money as me. Reddit loves to hate on women who only date men who makes six figures and own a house, but I\u2019m done with these broke tools.", "I think the OP has learned something valuable about her bf.", "Indeed.\n\nCan\u2019t believe that guy came on here screaming about \u201cit\u2019s not fair she gets her hair done\u201d.", "Glad to hear that you won\u2019t be wasting anymore time with him! Even worse is that once he moved in, he would refuse to leave and you would have a hell of a time getting rid of him. \n\nI will say I don\u2019t think someone needs to necessarily be making 6 figures to be more of a peer, but probably $80k and up. It also depends on if they have kids, large student loan debt they are still paying off, etc. But you definitely deserve to date someone who can wine and dine you sometimes and is able to provide for themself. \n\nLesson I wish everyone would learn: NEVER move in with an SO because one of you is having financial problems. That is not a good reason to take your relationship to that level. And there will be resentment and problems from the new dynamic of financial provider and taker. And then it will be so much harder to split if/when it doesn\u2019t work out. Moving in together should only be because you both want to take the next step in the relationship. And you should both be comfortable with the financial split."]}
