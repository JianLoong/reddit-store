We also go to college together and are co-workers, so naturally we spend a lot of time together. \n\nThis has been an ongoing issue in our relationship since my girlfriend complains about how much time I spend with my friend. We usually have classes together, work for group projects together and also study together sometimes. We also hang out sometimes (outside work and college). Well, my girlfriend's problem is that according to her I spend too much time with my friend and not with her or other friends. \n\nI tried to talk to my girlfriend many times about this, I told her that her jealousy is unjustified and that she's putting too much thought into something that's only in her mind. For some reason, she thinks I'm cheating on her with my friend. \n\nWell, the issue escalated two days ago. My friend and I had classes, then we had to go to work. Well, when my shift was about to end I got a text from my girlfriend asking me if I wanted to go out to eat with her. I told her that quite honestly I was too tired (I woke up at 4 am that day to study). She told me it's fine and that she could go to my apartment and we could order something. But to be honest, I know her, she would've asked me to go out since she \"doesn't see me tired at all\" and then I would have to agree. She has done that other times. So I told her I just wanted to sleep and that we could see each other the next day. \n\nThe next day I texted her good morning as I always do, she didn't reply. So I thought that she must be upset over something again. I didn't have class that morning, so I went to her house. Her mother let me in.\n\nShe told me she's angry because I don't take our relationship seriously and I never make time for her, which is a lie. I understand that she doesn't work, but I do. I don't have as much free time as she does. She told me that's a lie because I always have \"too much time for (friend's name)\". Well, the argument escalated and she started with her usual jealous complaints about my friend. She then tried to tell me that if I would really care about her then I'll stop being friends with her. \n\nI was upset too, because she's making such a big deal just because I was tired. And I told her that I would never stop being friends with anyone just because she doesn't like them, especially not someone who has been in my life longer than she did. She got even angrier and told me that she (as my girlfriend) should be the person I care about the most. I told her that that's not happening and that I care about many people more than I care about her, and that includes my friend. She kicked me out after that. \n\nI know that what I said wasn't the nicest, I'm well aware of that. But I feel like she started it, so to be honest I don't want to apologize before she does.", "created_utc": 1701529628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1895n5o/aita_for_saying_that_i_care_more_about_my_friend/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like at almost every waking moment. If it's not school? It's work. If it's not work? It's at study session. If it's not studying, it's hanging out. \n\nAre you prioritizing seeing your girlfriend? Does she feel prioritized? If not, then YTA. Regardless, telling someone there are many others you care about more than her does generally make you an AH. Hard to get around that one. \n\nUltimate verdict is ESH bc of her forcing an ultimatum between her and your friend but she wouldn't be an asshole if you weren't an asshole first. You're definitely the one that needs to apologize", "So why are you dating this girl when you clearly don\u2019t want to make time for her. You talk about all the things you do with your friend but you don\u2019t mention all the things you do with your girlfriend. I\u2019m totally fine with male and female friendships. My best friend is male.\n\nYou don\u2019t even seem to like this girl or care about her when she\u2019s begging for time from you.\n\nYTA and she deserves better.", "Yta you admitted you care more for your friend than you do for her. Her worries arent unfounded. You just dont wanna apologise for it and youre annoyed you feel like she\u2019s nagging you.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re ready for a relationship. If you cannot prioritise your girlfriend, meet minimal dating standards, and spend time with her at all, then don\u2019t be with her. You will not find a partner if you continue to behave like this.", "ESH. Why are you two in a relationship again?", "YTA. You don't have to stop being friends with your old friend, but if you want to bond with someone else or be in a relationship, you have to balance the amount of time you spend with others. You sound like you would rather the current girlfriend be like a third-tier friend, and she should find someone who values her more than you do (or she should be alone, since she's essentially being treated like that with you).", "Yta. Your gf is off base for the cheating accusations and giving you the ultimatum but with your lack off actual effort and interest making time for her, I'm not shocked she came to that conclusion. \n\nAlso, saying you care way more about other people than her was just cruel and unnecessary. She didn't \"start\" this problem. Your behavior is the problem.", "You told  your now ex the truth but understand when your prioritize a female friend over a GF, this will be a continuing pattern. Just the way it is guy.", "ESH\n\nIf you don't have time to be in a relationship don't be. You have dismissed your girlfriends feelings as she has openly told you she needs more. \n\n\n\nShe should be understanding of your commitments and respect that. However her being told she is not a priority was everything to justify her fears she has expressed to you.", "You spoke your truth whether you meant to or not. So time you both move on in different directions. YTA for keeping her around not really putting much value to her. And she is one for being overbearing and unreasonable. She might have had a point about your ditching her a lot in favor of your friend. And sometimes like eating out your friend and you could have included her. Possibly you and your friend are too busy thinking friends when there is a lot points that are saying you two belong together.", "> I didn't have class that morning, so I went to her house. Her mother let me in.\n\n\nYTA because it\u2019s annoying when people come over unannounced, especially after you declined her company the night before, twice.\n\n\n>I told her that that's not happening and that I care about many people more than I care about her, and that includes my friend.\n\n\nDouble YTA, hopefully she sees the light and ends things.", "YTA - Ah, I feel for your gf. Did you not prior to this relationship communicate what you expected of it? Or did you disillusion her with your strong favor of your friend and are writing her opinion off as jealously and nothing but.", "ESH. Even from what you've said here, OP, I gotta agree with your girlfriend that you don't take your relationship seriously and don't put in effort to spend time with her. Now, her problem is she's displacing her anger at you onto your friend, and demanding you cut off your friend was definitely going way too far. But your own actions are what caused her jealousy to fester and deepen. You shouldn't be ranking your loved ones by how much you care about them either.\n\nTo be honest I don't understand why you're dating this girl when you clearly don't even like her very much so I recommend breaking up with her for everyone's sake.", "INFO \n\nI\u2019m always so confused by people with the stance that since they\u2019ve known the friend forever, their SO will never be above them. I agree with girlfriends, but you\u2019d have to keep the same stance with your kids, your spouse, etc. At which year do the priorities switch for you? \n\nIn my opinion, you should just break up. I don\u2019t think you like her much, if at all. Which is shitty, but it is what it is. The friend is always going to be more important to you because of the time spent with her (since kindergarten!). I also don\u2019t think its fair for your (probably ex) girlfriend to try and get you to drop your lifelong friend, and her insecurities are exhausting! Regardless of how much time you spend with the girlfriend it with never be enough because she will keep comparing everything you do for her to your friend.", "Debating btw YTA and ESH she's your gf but it seems here you like your friend more than her which is weird... like saying \" I know she'll be like that and I can't deal with that\" about your SO is weird. Then maybe she has jealousy issue and just don't like m/f relationships.", "Obviously she shouldn\u2019t give you an ultimatum of her or your friend, that is not okay. But telling your gf of over a year that the same friend she is worried about matters more to you than she does is not okay at all. \n\nIt really sounds like she feels very unappreciated and like she\u2019s not a priority and she\u2019s worried that you like your friend more than her (which you just admitted to). Ofc your school and job should come first since those are obligations that you have made. But if you hang out with your friend when you have free time instead of your gf then that is a problem since you are too busy to see her most of the time but you get to see your friend every single day during school, study sessions and work. You need to prioritise your gf in those few free moments. \n\nAlso you need to learn how to say no to her when she is asking you to go out. Not allow her to just say you aren\u2019t tired. But you have to make it clear to her that you\u2019re not trying to get out of hanging out with her but instead that you just want to have a quiet night at home **with her**. Make it obvious that you want to be with her but also can\u2019t go out. \n\nWhen you two are together make her feel like she\u2019s the only thing that matters since you get such a limited time with each other. Don\u2019t just go hang out with your friend and invite her with. Because ultimately you\u2019re hanging out with the friend and she\u2019s just tagging along. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously insecure in this relationship and it\u2019s not hard to imagine that maybe your actions don\u2019t do much to help stop those insecurities. I hope you\u2019ve been trying to reassure her that there is nothing going on between you and that friend instead of just calling her crazy or insecure or saying that she\u2019s imagining things. Because that kind of reaction does not help her worries. \n\nIf you still have a gf after this fight then maybe it\u2019s a good idea to sit down and communicate about these problems and how you two want to fix them together.", "INFO: Do you even like your girlfriend? How often do you hang out with your girlfriend? What kind of stuff do you do together?\n\nEDIT: After seeing OP respond to similar questions, I think YTA. It doesn't sound like he spends enough time with his GF. I feel like if you have time to go out a few times a month with this friend from class, you ARE choosing her over your GF. And inviting your GF along is not a fix for that. \n\nYou already work with this girl and study with her. Honestly, you don't need to be hanging out with her a few times a month beyond that, especially if you're saying you just don't have time for your GF. You have time, you choose to spend it with another girl.\n\nAlso:\n\n>I told her that that's not happening and that I care about many people more than I care about her, and that includes my friend. \n\nIf your GF is low on your totem pole of people you care about, why are you dating her?", "The natural progression of things, is boy meets girl, they fall in love, they spend tons of time together, friends feel left out, the boy and girl get married...  \n\nWhat you're describing - doesn't sound like your heart, your desire, your future is really all that interested in gf.", "YTA\n\nShe's asking for the bare minimum dude  \nAfter reading your replies, big YTA.  \nHow can you not have talked to her since a damn week?", "YTA;  If your female friend went up to you right now and said \u201cwould u wanna date sometime? we already spend so much time together.\u201d  What would u say?  I already know the answer I think you\u2019d be hesitant at first but eventually go through with it.  You should stop leading your girlfriend on, you definitely have feelings for your childhood female friend.  Just the way you talk about her, you\u2019re girlfriend is right to think something\u2019s up, this didn\u2019t pass the smell check.", "Well I see this relationship as done. If you've got others that you care more about than her, she needs to move on. You just did her a favor in my opinion! And yes, you are a major AH. YTA", "Is this a joke?", "ESH here and everyone is hella immature.\nJust be single dude. It sounds like it's the best for everyone.\nIt's okay to care about your friends more than S.O. just means that you and your S.O. shouldn't be together. \nStop wasting each other's time.", "INFO: how many time do you **actually** spend with your girlfriend and your friend?", "YTA for how you handled the argument. Whether you're a man or a woman, if you decide to be in  a romantic relationship with someone, you have to make time for them, making them feel prioritized and appreciated, if you aren't capable of doing that, stay single, it'll spare you more drama.", "YTA", "YTA. The way you talk about your gf it sounds like you don\u2019t even like her? You make her sound like an obligation. Why don\u2019t you want to spend time with her?", "YTA, your long rant post about what you legit do with your friend versus how your girlfriend is annoying is self-explanatory. Why do you even need a girlfriend then?", "YTA. Seriously? Maybe you should consider dating your friend instead. How in the freaking hell you think your gf is going to be happy of the fact that you spend more time with another girl than with her...", "Yta. You clearly spend the majority of your time with your friend and see no issue with it. Do you even like your girlfriend? If someone I was planning on spending my life with was this upset I wouldn't just shrug it off and think they are being unreasonable. Why are you not with the friend?", "YTA dude, you\u2019re clearly not ready for a girlfriend based on your post and your replies.", "Is this friend your only friend or something? Cause if so get more.  You basically spend every second that you\u2019re not with your girlfriend with your friend.   You\u2019re asking for advice and making excuses not to use that advice. You wanna stay in this relationship start off by studying by yourself or with someone else.  You don\u2019t need to work with this friend on every project and you shouldn\u2019t be inviting your girlfriend as a third party every-time you and your friend go somewhere. Not to mention not only do you have several classes with this friend you work with them. YTA.", "I\u2019m going to say N A H in the situation overall (which I think will be a little bit of a hot take) because it sounds like there\u2019s just a mismatch here. GF wants to be a priority, and OP can\u2019t/won\u2019t make her one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for anyone to judge if work, school, friends inherently or objectively outranks a romantic relationship/partner or not. I think that depends on the person. But it seems like OP and GF simply have different priorities, and either need to figure out how to meet the others\u2019 needs (she needs to feel important, you need to be able to study/work/relax in peace) or find other partners who are able to do so. \n\nAn ex and I broke up (years ago) because he was crazy ambitious with his studies and career and I always took a back seat. I prioritize relationships/family over career and wanted a partner who would do the same. Had he and I ended up together we would\u2019ve resented each other. Neither of us was right or wrong, we just didn\u2019t match up. \n\nHowever, your question here is if you\u2019re TA for your comment, and hell yes, YTA! \n\nEven if she was being unreasonable, and even if your comment was entirely truthful, it was cruel and you knew it would be. (If you had said it impulsively \u201cin the heat of the moment\u201d and truly not intended it to be cruel, then you wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to apologize.) \n\nYou should apologize for saying something so hurtful (do NOT phrase it like \u201cyou\u2019re sorry she was hurt\u201d bc that\u2019s bullshit and worse than no apology at all) and decide if you care about the relationship enough to make her feel like she is a priority (the important part here is that she FEELS she is a priority, not that you think you are doing enough that she should be satisfied) or if you don\u2019t. And you would not be TA for deciding you don\u2019t.", "Your gf needs to drop your inadequate ass and find someone who appreciates her and wants her in their life. Quit wasting her time.", "YTA.\n\nYour girlfriend has the right to be concerned by this. You should NOT be spending this much time with your friend, especially since she is a girl. That is just asking for something inappropriate to happen. Your girlfriend should be your best friend, and I bet you would feel very uncomfortable if she had a guy best friend that she spend that much time with. \n\nAt this point, your girlfriend deserves better.", "YTA, and almost every girlfriend  you will ever have will have a problem with you spending every waking moment with your female beastie. Kinda sounds like you need some boundaries in your life .or just date your friend since she's clearly who you care more about, don't string along your gf.", "ESH\n\nFor her behavior as a whole, she may actually be exaggerating at some points.\n\nBut you are not blameless either. And it's not even about whether you were the nicest at that particular moment. The thing is, apparently she actually isn't even in your top three priorities and that's just wrong being in such a long relationship. You practically said it yourself, there are so many people more important than her... what's the point? You're wasting your time and hers. I'm not surprised she kicked you out after what she heard.", "Putting the issue of your friend to the side, what is the point in being in a relationship with anyone if you will always care more about people you\u2019ve known longer?\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re spending so much time with your friend outside of work and school, your girlfriend is not the only woman who would be uncomfortable with that, especially when it seems she\u2019s last on your list of priorities. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like you have the time to put into a relationship to be honest. \n\nESH", "I have to ask, are you in the friend zone with your friend? You clearly like her company more from what I read in your post. I get that GF comes across as jealous and needy but if you are treating her like that then it is no surprise. It just appears that GF is just a stocking filler which is shity in itself and bound to get a kick back.", "I'm sorry but she should be the one you care about the most, shes making the sacrifices of being loyal to you  wanting to spend time with you, go on dates, do things together, she could easily (as most girls can) find somebody else to give her that attention and she isnt. It's one thing not being allowed to have friends, but that's not what it sounds like to me, than putting a woman over your partner, that is absolutely unacceptable. Dont waste the poor girls time if you're putting your friend above her, fuck your friend instead of this poor girl, sounds like she just wants to spend time with you for god sake. Let some other man take care of her and give her what she wants.", "Soft YTA. At the end of the day, we don't really know how much time OP and friend do indeed spend together asides from work and school, which for obvious reasons he can't do with his gf.\n\nBut I also think that if you truly did love her, not cutting off your friend, but not hanging out with her either wouldn't be any issue to do. \n\nYour female friend should have other friends besides you, she will more likely be fine if you cut spending time outside of work/school with her to spend it with your girlfriend.\n\nAnd imo, it's the bare minimum if you're in love with someone. So unless your girlfriend is the biggest red flag and you're not convinced that you want to be with her, I believe you could stop hanging out with your friend.", "ESH your gf has a point and I understand the jealousy. Asking you to stop being friends is absurd though and pretty manipulative.", "So what actually time do you spend with your (ex) GF when you are not crawled up your female friend's butt?\n\nYTA", "ESH.\n\nThese lines in particular stand out:\n\n\"She then tried to tell me that if I would really care about her then I'll stop being friends with her.\"\n\nManipulative BS. \n\nand:\n\n\"I care about many people more than I care about her, and that includes my friend\"\n\nThis is understandable when you first start dating (not sure I would actually say it though), but over a year if there isn't some significant care in the relationship it seems like a pointless one. I don't like turning things into competitions like that, but telling her that you care about loads of people (not just something like a child or sibling) more than her is not a statement I see any value in making.", "NTA for this particular fight. She also so manipulative if she doesn\u2019t get that you were up at 4am and worked at school and a job all day. You were legitimately tired and she\u2019s being jealous in a way that is controlling.\n\nFind a new GF. Also, does this friend have a bf? It does appear she is using you as a surrogate for having a bf.

I disagree with people who are saying you should find more time when they haven\u2019t asked how much time you have after working and going to school full time or how the 2 relationships support you in this! Especially when you have a study buddy and coworker who happens to be one of your oldest friends. \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to state the fact that she will not be able to cut people out of your life and your loyalty to someone you\u2019ve known most of your life is a priority. \n\nBe with someone who respects your choices and dedication to school and friendship and talks to you about spending more time together with this in mind.

We've never had a romantic element to our relationship, we just enjoy each other's company and care for each other.

As I've got older, I've learned that this is just how a lot of women feel, and I can do a \\*lot\\* to help the situation by hanging out with both the girlfriend and my friend a couple of times. Let the girlfriend see that you're not hiding anything and there's no competition.

Well, my girlfriend's problem is that according to her I spend too much time with my friend and not with her or other friends. \n\nI tried to talk to my girlfriend many times about this, I told her that her jealousy is unjustified and that she's putting too much thought into something that's only in her mind. For some reason, she thinks I'm cheating on her with my friend. \n\nWell, the issue escalated two days ago. My friend and I had classes, then we had to go to work. Well, when my shift was about to end I got a text from my girlfriend asking me if I wanted to go out to eat with her. I told her that quite honestly I was too tired (I woke up at 4 am that day to study). She told me it's fine and that she could go to my apartment and we could order something. But to be honest, I know her, she would've asked me to go out since she \"doesn't see me tired at all\" and then I would have to agree. She has done that other times. So I told her I just wanted to sleep and that we could see each other the next day. \n\nThe next day I texted her good morning as I always do, she didn't reply. So I thought that she must be upset over something again. I didn't have class that morning, so I went to her house. Her mother let me in.\n\nShe told me she's angry because I don't take our relationship seriously and I never make time for her, which is a lie. I understand that she doesn't work, but I do. I don't have as much free time as she does. She told me that's a lie because I always have \"too much time for (friend's name)\". Well, the argument escalated and she started with her usual jealous complaints about my friend. She then tried to tell me that if I would really care about her then I'll stop being friends with her. \n\nI was upset too, because she's making such a big deal just because I was tired. And I told her that I would never stop being friends with anyone just because she doesn't like them, especially not someone who has been in my life longer than she did. She got even angrier and told me that she (as my girlfriend) should be the person I care about the most. I told her that that's not happening and that I care about many people more than I care about her, and that includes my friend. She kicked me out after that. \n\nI know that what I said wasn't the nicest, I'm well aware of that. But I feel like she started it, so to be honest I don't want to apologize before she does.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
