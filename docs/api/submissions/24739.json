The HOA rules don\u2019t usually trump the local code. For instance, legally I\u2019m required to get permission from my neighbor for a fence that\u2019s 4 inches or less to our property line. My HOA says differently. They lose that battle every time. Thankfully, my neighbors and I all need the exact same height fence for our insurance so we\u2019re able to easily come to an agreement at the property line.

If he has to put up a fence at the property line and can\u2019t do it within the property line as you\u2019ve stated elsewhere, and you didn\u2019t need his permission to effect a fence on the line between your two properties, why isn\u2019t he within his right to take down part of the fence you\u2019ve erected and erect his own?

Stand your ground!", "It will cost you something because he is removing and throwing away your fence that you paid for. The fence is your property, it belongs to you. Removing and damaging the fence deprives you of property that you own. Doing it without your permission is vandalism, destruction of property, theft. You paid $7,500 for the fence. If he would like to purchase that section of your fence from you for say, $10,000, and then replace that section of the fence that he now owns with a different fence, *then* it wouldn\u2019t be costing you anything", "Yeah knowing all this I\u2019d just say no.  He can build the cage fence around the pool", "Tough shit. NTA", "Similar situation in our HOA, all fences connect and are on the property line, so we split the cost with a neighbor to repair the shared fence line (and the boards are all the same so it wasn\u2019t a big deal to have that done when our fence went up). In your situation the ONLY thing I\u2019d consider is letting him have his fence if he pays you back for 1/3 of yours.
