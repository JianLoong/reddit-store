Asking to be paid on Thursday and getting paid on Tuesday is 3 business days, and that\u2019s totally reasonable, especially for a long term customer. If she expected to be paid immediately, she should have communicated that to you *before* services were rendered. \n\nIt\u2019s also totally reasonable for you to not answer your phone for a few days/over the weekend. People are way too comfortable with the expectation that everyone else will be available to them 24/7.
