Your child being ill is not a reasonable excuse to not quickly send a Venmo payment. Her texting you and saying you owed $60 is an invoice. It didn't need to be complicated.", "YTA. She provided the service, you should have paid it immediately. I don\u2019t know of any small business like that where they give you time to pay, big companies yes, but not small businesses.

Asking to be paid on Thursday and getting paid on Tuesday is 3 business days, and that\u2019s totally reasonable, especially for a long term customer. If she expected to be paid immediately, she should have communicated that to you *before* services were rendered. \n\nIt\u2019s also totally reasonable for you to not answer your phone for a few days/over the weekend. People are way too comfortable with the expectation that everyone else will be available to them 24/7. If immediate payment was that important to her, again, she should have articulated that *beforehand*.\n\nTexting and calling a dozen times, before 8am, is psychotic.

OP completely ignored her after saying she would pay later that day, and after previously always paying her at time of time of service. I\u2019ve never had a lawn care company not expect payment at time of service.", "Deadbeats deserve it. You behaved like a deadbeat.", "No one deserves to be stiffed. Period.", "Is this her hobby? What else is it if that\u2019s what she does for work? My goodness, you\u2019re insufferable in addition to being a major AH. This comes off as classist also. Be better.", "[removed]", "You had the opportunity to pay multiple days in a row.  If you don\u2019t want 6am texts, turn your phone to do not disturb while you sleep.  YTA.  Assume that yes she needs the money.  It\u2019s Holiday season for goodness sake. What is wrong with you?", "Yes", "Id of waited on your fucking porch and squeezed every last cent you owed me out your goddamn wallet.", "Yes", "Yes, if they appeared to be ducking my communications in order to avoid paying.", "Your also lucky she didn\u2019t charge days past due. I give 5 days of a grace period to pay, if not paid by then it\u2019s a $5 fee per day without pay. \n\nRegardless of \u201cnot knowing\u201d or not, I have plenty of services that haven\u2019t specifically said \u201cpayment due at time of service\u201d but I still make sure I pay them day of service. Unless you had a contract that stated \u201cpayment due within x amount of days\u201d just pay her day of. I\u2019m not sure why you don\u2019t think you were the AH here, you went days without paying someone. \n\n\nRealistically, running your own business is working 24/7. She probably texted you at 6 am because it was her only free time to be able to be on her phone. Especially in that line of work. \n\nWould you like to do a job and not get paid on time? Or have your job not pay you on pay day and hold it for a few days? Or would you be trying to get your money?", "5 days. People who use \"business days\" are using it as an excuse to extend terms.", "If you were so annoyed with her calls why didn\u2019t you pick up your personal phone for 30 seconds and you know\u2026pay her? I feel like you\u2019re acting like sending a venmo is some long drawn out process. I mean you could have even done it while in the active act of caring for your child.", "Which you could\u2019ve avoided by paying her. Or responding, \u201cI have sent a Venmo for the plowing I owe. I\u2019ve realized that that we\u2019re not on the same page regarding this business relationship so I won\u2019t need your plowing services going forward. Please do not contact me again\u201d. \n\nInstead you\u2019ve chosen to play the victim because you don\u2019t like being reminded that you owe", "You\u2019ve never really been harassed, have you? Lucky you.", "She never asked me to pay her same day for lawn. She never said it was necessary. I just happened to pay day of.", "I was never going to not pay her.", "In my defense I did not reach out to hire her. She texted me asking if she could be hired to remove my snow. She did that the day before the service.", "But how else will you prove you bought that donut??? So many of life\u2019s issues could be solved by following Mitch\u2019s advice.", "Her husband does the work not her.", "Way to assume. She did NOT mow all summer. She mowed twice.", "She never told me she expected payment day or for lawn services. She did my lawn twice.  Now I looked back.  One time she did my lawn she texted me 10 times cuz I had not paid her 2 hours after service. I was working.  \nI assumed after that I wouldn\u2019t use her again.  But then she asked to remove my snow.", "I did not respond over the weekend. Which I feel is reasonable.", "I did not respond over the weekend. Which I feel is reasonable.", "I\u2019m a first time home owner and my other people have billed and given a week to 30 days to pay, so I\u2019m not familiar with how most of these services bill etc.  \nbut yeah I think if she had sent to collections I\u2019d have had legal grounds to fight that.", "I mean, I went E.SH but at my old house, the guy mowed my lawn when I wasn't there all the time, and we would square up roughly every month. \n\n4 days is not worth harassment like she describes here. I guess we can disagree about who is the bigger AH, but there is blame to share in this situation.\n\nThe lady is delusional about going to collections 5 days after service, especially since she was paid on the day prior.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She will continue to operate the same as before. There is no reason for her change. She is providing you all year service rather than a seasonal one.", "Regardless, you established an informal arrangement with her. Therefore, using your past interaction with her, it is reasonable for her to assume that the same arrangement would take place. You are the one who acted out of the ordinary. You didn't ask for specifics. If nothing was explicitly mentioned, then the bill is due whenever she says it is. Plus, from the sounds of it, she very clearly asked for payment and waited a reasonable amount of time before escalating. How is she to know \"life happened\" to you? To her you are just some shady person who may be skipping on their bill. She is just a businesswoman looking for payment for services rendered by whatever means she sees fit. It is not up to you, the one who is deliquescent in their payment, to decide when or how she pursues what is is rightfully owed to her.", "You just didn't pay her when she asked.", "You chose to wait far too long and you know it. \nWhat\u2019re you, super poor and desperate for free yard services maybe????", "That isn\u2019t a defense you had worked with her already. Own up to the fact that you handled this wrong and forced this women to chase after you to get a payment you KNEW you had to pay. Then to top it off you called her names. Your behavior is outright appalling.", "Okay, so it's a dude with a shovel, pay him.", "Yeah that was a crazy assumption for me to make since you said \"she mowed my lawn in the summer\". What was i thinking with my wild assumptions?? /s", "Really? \u201cWay to assume\u201d you had a month to pay her", "So you're unable to use the words \"No thanks!\"? Still YTA.", "So you knew well before the snow removal that she expected immediate payment. Noted.", "Did you respond Thursday or Friday?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you pay? To spite her or because you didn\u2019t have the money?\n\nLike seriously you are broke or psychotic and lack human empathy. Did you have the money or not?", "wtf does being a homeowner have to do with this?\n\nif you go to the salon and get a haircut, do you pay weeks after???", "You said: \"...my other people\". This right here explains a lot.", "You would not have such grounds.", "Good.", "lol how delusional can one person be?", "But you still really don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, after typing that out, huh?", "I'm getting the vibe that OP was so offended that payment was requested she purposefully made the woman wait longer than necessary.", "She never said it was payment day or for lawn care.", "She never asked for immediate payment for yard work. But I was and happened to pay day.  Never ever did she say she expected or needed payment day of.", "You shouldn\u2019t t have presumed anything. You should have used your words. Even then you still neglected to pay her for how many days? All that is coming off is your trying to screw a small business owner out of money because you thought you wouldn\u2019t have to if your ignored her long enough.", "Accountability-  an acceptance of responsibility for honest and ethical conduct towards others.\n\nLearn it. Live it.\n\nYTA", "She did. She texted you and told you how much to pay and how to pay it. You pay when asked. Simple as that.", "So you had an already established practice of paying upon services rendered. She had no reason to think you would change that. Home services are not the same as a businesses where there is generally a quote with payment terms and a contract.", "She did the one time you didn't pay immediately.", "Lol I would have never ever not paid.  I simply got busy and it fell the the side as I was in the er with my child all weekend.  I would have never ever just not paid her.  Ever.", "How is she suppose to know that though? You may be a honest person, but nobody knows whether that is true or not. You got pissed and cruel because she didn\u2019t want to get screwed. How would you like it if people called you names because you were trying to do your job and feed your family?", "Yea and ghosting this lady for days was supposed to let her know that `I would have never ever just not paid her. Ever.` how exactly?"]}
