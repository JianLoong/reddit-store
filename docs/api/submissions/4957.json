When I told my mom, she said she\u2019d already told everyone in the family to gift me money for a PS5. I told her it wasn\u2019t necessary, but she said I should still get the PS5 and give the PS4 to my 10 year old brother. I asked her if I still had to pay for a chunk of the PS5 and she said yes. I asked if my brother would be getting a normal Christmas on top of me giving him the PS4 and she said yes. \n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that my brother is horribly behaved and if he was my kid, he\u2019d barely get anything for Christmas. That\u2019s how bad he is. He\u2019s also very mean and disrespectful to me. He constantly puts me down, he\u2019ll say things to me like \u201cno one will ever want to marry you, you\u2019ll end up alone,\u201d he says crappy things about my dad that he\u2019s never met (we\u2019re half siblings), he insults every interest of mine, and he\u2019s also called me a jackass and a bitch before (he calls me names because I don\u2019t put up with his behavior). He\u2019s said hateful things that have reduced me to tears many times. It\u2019s been hard these past 10 years because I\u2019ve watched him do whatever he wants while I was a very well behaved child. My mom says it\u2019s because he\u2019s a boy and this is how boys act. \n\nTo top it all off, my brother has much more than I did growing up.

You're 25, your mom has no say anymore over what you do with your money or your things. \n\nIf you still live with your mom or are getting financial support from her, that makes it a little more complicated, but she should have no way to force you to give someone a present. It sounds like your brother is really cruel to you, and I would limit your contact with him as much as possible. It might help to do some real thinking on this whole dynamic, and how much energy is healthy to spend dealing with your family.

I don\u2019t even have the money right now to cover the additional cost anyway. And I\u2019m not talking about the gifts I receive now, I was talking about the gifts I received as a child.

If I was her friend and I\u2019d been so generous as to gift her a PS4, knowing how much she\u2019s wanted one, and she just gave it away to someone else, I\u2019d be pissed off. Yes it\u2019s hers to do with what she wanted, but that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be a slap in the face to the generous friend. Coupled with the fact her brother is awful to her, she doesn\u2019t actually want to give it away and her \u2018generous gift from family\u2019 is nothing of the sort, I don\u2019t see how she\u2019s the AH at all.", "I'm not gonna lie it's a bit whiney but she did say she told her mother not to worry about the ps5 when her friend gave her the ps4.

I thought you were saying my decision of holding onto my gift was childish. The reason why this is such a dilemma is because there\u2019s tension between my mom and I and it\u2019s Christmastime.

It\u2019s not that you yourself are childish, it\u2019s that your mother is still treating you like a child.  What you have described is a situation of her making, not yours.\n\nIf I look at my own life, I can think of a time in my 30s when my own mother kept demanding that I bought a particular present for my 3 nieces.  I didn\u2019t want to and simply said \u201cno\u201d as she got more and more irate, more and more insulting, with each passing day.  Eventually it was too late, she stopped, and she forgot about it.  If I had described that in a full post, it would likely read very similar to yours.\n\nAgain, my apologies for being flippant with you. Stick to your guns, don\u2019t let her nag and bully you.
