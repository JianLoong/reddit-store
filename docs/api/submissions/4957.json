Of course I\u2019ve wanted the PS5 since it came out, but I can\u2019t afford it. My mom knew I wanted one, so she floated the idea of asking family members to pull money together, but I\u2019d still have to come up with a couple hundred dollars and pay for the accessories. I was seriously considering it. \n\nThen, my friend gave me his PS4 (for my December birthday) that was only a couple months old because he just got a PS5. I was thrilled. When I told my mom, she said she\u2019d already told everyone in the family to gift me money for a PS5. I told her it wasn\u2019t necessary, but she said I should still get the PS5 and give the PS4 to my 10 year old brother. I asked her if I still had to pay for a chunk of the PS5 and she said yes. I asked if my brother would be getting a normal Christmas on top of me giving him the PS4 and she said yes. \n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that my brother is horribly behaved and if he was my kid, he\u2019d barely get anything for Christmas. That\u2019s how bad he is. He\u2019s also very mean and disrespectful to me. He constantly puts me down, he\u2019ll say things to me like \u201cno one will ever want to marry you, you\u2019ll end up alone,\u201d he says crappy things about my dad that he\u2019s never met (we\u2019re half siblings), he insults every interest of mine, and he\u2019s also called me a jackass and a bitch before (he calls me names because I don\u2019t put up with his behavior). He\u2019s said hateful things that have reduced me to tears many times. It\u2019s been hard these past 10 years because I\u2019ve watched him do whatever he wants while I was a very well behaved child. My mom says it\u2019s because he\u2019s a boy and this is how boys act. \n\nTo top it all off, my brother has much more than I did growing up. He has the name brand clothes and shoes, he has two Nintendo switches when I never got the Nintendo DS I asked for every Christmas. He\u2019s very spoiled. \n\nHe\u2019s already getting a ton of Christmas gifts (including a Yamaha keyboard which I also asked for as a kid for years and never received). My mom doesn\u2019t really gift me anything anymore because money is tight and \u201cChristmas is for kids.\u201d This wouldn\u2019t bother me if this hadn\u2019t been going on for 10 years and if he behaved better. \n\nSo, I was upset when my mom said I could get a PS5 (as my only birthday and Christmas gift- because I didn\u2019t get any birthday gifts from her) if I could cover a part of it and pay for the accessories, but that I should give the PS4 to my brother because \u201cI got the PS4 for free\u201d and he would \u201clove me forever.\u201d \n\nI called everyone in the family and told them I didn\u2019t want a PS5 anymore and now my mom is accusing me of being selfish and unfair. I really thought I had a fair point. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I think it\u2019s also important to mention that I really don\u2019t have a couple extra hundred dollars to cover the additional money for a PS5 right now.", "created_utc": 1671286919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo7adt/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_brother_my_ps4/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is as if your post was describing the dilemma of a henpecked child.\n\nYou\u2019re 25.  You\u2019re an adult now.  Your mother should have no say in what you do with your Xmas presents.  Tell her to mind her own business.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is intending to be rude, just it\u2019s horrifying that your parents are being this way to an adult. \n\nKeep your PS4, because even if you\u2019re being guilted out of a gift (hmph! How dare your mother tell you what to do with your gift!), at the very least you\u2019d have some explaining to do if your friend checked up on you as to how you\u2019re going with it! \n\nBuy something nice for yourself and enjoy Christmas as an NTA - and tell anyone else in the family who is being told a different story and asks how this came to blow up, remind them that you didn\u2019t get a darn thing for Birthday OR Christmas without favouritism ruining it all, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re the NTA in this situation!", "OP, I'd put it this way: the way you describe your relationship with your mom and brother, it sounds the dynamic of a teenager and not an independent adult. You're 25, your mom has no say anymore over what you do with your money or your things. \n\nIf you still live with your mom or are getting financial support from her, that makes it a little more complicated, but she should have no way to force you to give someone a present. It sounds like your brother is really cruel to you, and I would limit your contact with him as much as possible. It might help to do some real thinking on this whole dynamic, and how much energy is healthy to spend dealing with your family. This seems like a symptom of the problem, not the cause.", "I would not be getting a PS5, I would get money to put towards a PS5. I don\u2019t even have the money right now to cover the additional cost anyway. And I\u2019m not talking about the gifts I receive now, I was talking about the gifts I received as a child. I just felt like giving him a PS4 is reinforcing that he gets everything handed to him even though he\u2019s poorly behaved to an extreme level. I hope this provides a little more clarification.", "Well this is a truly awful take. If I was her friend and I\u2019d been so generous as to gift her a PS4, knowing how much she\u2019s wanted one, and she just gave it away to someone else, I\u2019d be pissed off. Yes it\u2019s hers to do with what she wanted, but that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be a slap in the face to the generous friend. Coupled with the fact her brother is awful to her, she doesn\u2019t actually want to give it away and her \u2018generous gift from family\u2019 is nothing of the sort, I don\u2019t see how she\u2019s the AH at all.", "I'm not gonna lie it's a bit whiney but she did say she told her mother not to worry about the ps5 when her friend gave her the ps4. The 5 isn't cheap and games are even more expensive than the 4's. That's not ungrateful it's being smart with money.", "Okay, I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were saying my decision of holding onto my gift was childish. The reason why this is such a dilemma is because there\u2019s tension between my mom and I and it\u2019s Christmastime. I just wanted to know if I was in the wrong.", "\u201cI called everyone in my family and told them\u2026\u201d\n\nWho does that?!", "That\u2019s fair, my apologies.", "Info Do you still live at home? I'm only asking because it would be easier for you to go lc/nc if you live on your own. I know it's a lot easier said than done but for your mental heatlh I feel that would honestly be best. Sounds like  your brother is the golden child, and your mom has decided that you're her emotional punching bag", "I suppose that\u2019s really the point here.  It\u2019s not that you yourself are childish, it\u2019s that your mother is still treating you like a child.  What you have described is a situation of her making, not yours.\n\nIf I look at my own life, I can think of a time in my 30s when my own mother kept demanding that I bought a particular present for my 3 nieces.  I didn\u2019t want to and simply said \u201cno\u201d as she got more and more irate, more and more insulting, with each passing day.  Eventually it was too late, she stopped, and she forgot about it.  If I had described that in a full post, it would likely read very similar to yours.\n\nAgain, my apologies for being flippant with you. Stick to your guns, don\u2019t let her nag and bully you.  It\u2019s your PS4 and present from a friend.  That\u2019s a nice thing to have.  Hold onto it.", "That part doesn't pertain to my point but if someone called me and said 'thank you but no thank you, I was gifted the older version and it's more than enough' I'd be annoyed that I have to actually come up with an idea at that point but, also pleasantly surprised that they're not materialistic and get them something else dope"]}
