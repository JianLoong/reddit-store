You probably didn\u2019t need to say anything about your grandmother to try to justify it, but it honestly doesn\u2019t matter why you prefer the name. It\u2019s YOUR baby. As long as you and your husband are good with it, that\u2019s great. \n\nThis is why we didn\u2019t let anyone know potential names at all before the birth and we\u2019d selected the name legally.

When the complainers do the nine months, they can chime in. Until then, they need to exhibit grace and be supportive of new baby, baby's Ma, and Papa.  That your family is punishing you over a petty squabble over baby's name...ma&pa get to name the child. After the name is given, people need to respect that.", "Nta.
