This included a brand new king-size bed/mattress, which I ended up hating, and now 5 years later finally decided to get a new mattress.\n\nAfter our new mattress purchase, we needed to get rid of our current one. It was still in great shape, and had been in a waterproof, hypoallergenic case the entire time we owned it. We figured we could get some decent money for it.\n\nMy brother-in-law had mentioned a while back that he and his wife were looking for a different king-size mattress, so on a whim, I just threw out there that we were getting rid of ours. He gladly accepted our offer to try it out.\n\nBack story - I love my BIL and his wife, we get along pretty well. However, they are very, VERY stingy people and often take advantage of other people's generosity and any other ways they can save a quick buck. I'm all for being smart with money, but when they do it to the detriment of others, it irks me.\n\nAnyway, they came over to try out the mattress, liked it, and asked my husband to help them load it up. I then asked if it would be easier for them to pay cash, or to just Venmo us. BIL was confused, and thought we were offering to \"give\" them the mattress. Thankfully, husband backed me up and said the mattress was in great condition and we're going to sell it elsewhere if they didn't want to buy it.\n\nOn the spot, husband said we would list it for $850, but BIL could have it for $700 if he took it now. I honestly hadn't even looked back at how much we paid for the mattress brand new, but just went with my husbands offer. BIL reluctantly accepted, and kept making comments about how WE were being unreasonable in charging \"family\", that we were being greedy, etc.\n\nAnyway, he paid the $700 and they have the mattress.\n\nA few days later, I got our statement for our new mattress, and out of curiosity, looked back in our account to see what the previous mattress costed us. It was then that I realized we had actually only paid $950 for the previous mattress - so after 5 years, we had only reduced the price by $250. To me, I felt that **was** a little greedy on our part, and now I'm feeling guilt because I'm NOT someone that likes to take advantage of others for a quick buck. I haven't told anyone else this, for fear of starting a disagreement.\n\nSo, AITA for what I believe to be \"overcharging\" my BIL?\n\nShould I give him some money back?

Your brother-in-law is also an idiot for even paying you.", "NAH\n\nYou listed a price, BIL accepted. Transaction is over and done with. No need to make a song and dance about it.", "It seems like you implied you were offering them a free mattress and then your BIL only paid to save everyone the embarrassment. I doubt he would\u2019ve jumped on $700 for a used mattress. *High end* mattresses are only around $2k these days. \n\nMost people give away mattresses they don\u2019t want anymore. YTA for this one and I\u2019d think about whether your BIL and SIL are actually stingy or if you seem to be making offers that are really business deals? Do you also \u201ctake them to dinner\u201d and then expect to split the check? Do you offer to *buy everyone a round* then tell them it\u2019s their turn?\n\nOr it could just be your phrasing.

It doesn\u2019t matter how great your waterproof case is, it\u2019s a mattress you\u2019ve been sleeping on every night for 5 years. It is not lightly used, it\u2019s very used. \n\nEven if that wasn\u2019t the case, wanting to keep the money when you know you overcharged them is not a good look. I get that it might be embarrassing, but you need to give them their money back.", "YTA. I'd give it back.  First, you didn't communicate and tell him an amount until he picked it up.  He likely paid it to keep the peace only.  Second... nowhere is going to pay you $850 for a FIVE year old used mattress.  I don't care what it was kept in (and why.... why would you keep it in plastic?)  Anyway, give it back to him because that is integrity and the right thing to do.", "YTA.  \n\n1. You did say \"get rid of\" which put everyone in an awkward position.  \n\n2. a 17% family discount is insultingly stingy. \n\n3. That 17% was only AFTER the awkward exchange.  Your original discount was 0. For no hassle of having to sell it.\n\n4. you didn't sanitize the mattress according to state law before resale.", "I'd feel scammed if someone did that to me tbh.", "YTA - you should\u2019ve checked how much you paid for the mattress and charged them at most half of that. I love how you say your BIL is cheap when you\u2019re the one charging 700 bucks for a 5 yo mattress\u2026", "OP that's a 300-100 Dollar Mattress. They aren't cheap but almost nobody buys used. You conned them unintentionally. I'd just give back 4-600 because holy shit that's robbery.", "YTA - 5 years of farts alone is worth more than a $250 discount. \n\nAlso it's just slimy behavior, it sounds like husband wasn't clear from the beginning that he was gonna sell it to your bil, and the price was just too much. Not everything has to be an investment that you flip for value. \n\n$950? 5 years of farts, sex, and body juices, AND it's out of your house right away and you don't have to meet a stranger? $300-$400 max.", "NAH, but if it were me, I would give them back a few hundred and explain that you noticed an error. To me, 700 for a used five year old mattress is far too much, and if I was your BIL, I wouldn't have paid it, but maybe that's just me.", "YTA. You know you charged the wrong price and it didn\u2019t sound at all like you were actually going to mousy the mattress - you likely would have paid to dispose of it. \n\nNothing like judgy family members - your BIL might be stingy but at least he\u2019s not a tougher.", "YTA\n\n>My brother-in-law had mentioned a while back that he and his wife were looking for a different king-size mattress, so on a whim, I just threw out there that we were getting rid of ours.

And now you tried to make him sound greedy by saying they often take advantage of people whereas all I read is you trying to take advantage of him.", "Yta. Yuck.", "YTA. It's kind of exploitative to expect your family to subsidize you getting a new mattress.", "I don't know of ywbta if you don't give you BIL some cash back, but you would be a sheister. 850 for a used, 5 year old matress? Yuck. I cant believe your BIL gave you 700 for it, I dont drop cash like that without some research. Unless it was some crazy good deal, it was also likely a POS mattress if it was only 950 brand new. At any rate, you never get to call your BIL a cheapskate again.", "YTA. At least based off what you said, you told them that you were \"getting rid\" of it. I feel that is safe to assume it was an offer of, this would cost money to take to the dump, wanna save us the money and take our old mattress? I think you should have made it clear you wanted money at the start.\n\nAlso, your mattress was 5 years old. Even though many people use mattresses for ages, mattresses are generally considered to have a life span of 7 to 10 years so you've already used up half the lifespan of the mattress.\n\nYou also barely gave a discount from what you originally paid for a brand new mattress. I think you could easily solve the problem by apologizing and giving some of the funds back because it really seems you overcharged them and surprised them with having to pay.", "YTA.\n\n'I just threw out there that we were getting rid of ours.'\n\nThat isn't being upfront about selling it; no wonder they were confused. Why didn't you discuss pricing before they came to collect? It's odd at best and suspicious at worst that your husband 'randomly' came up with a figure for the price.\n\nAlso 700 for a 5year old used mattress? That's a scam in my book!\n\n'I'm all for being smart with money, but when they do it to the detriment of others, it irks me.'\n\nCome on. You have to know you're being a hypocrite here.", "YTA. It costs $100 to have an old used mattress (which yours certainly was after 5 years, especially because an $850 mattress is not high end in any way) removed and recycled. You are clueless and stingy as hell", "YTA, that\u2019s really shady to charge family that much on the spot for a five year old mattress that you\u2019ve been using.  And then to find out you only paid $950 for it new?  \n\nI\u2019m not sure how you address this but I think maybe they aren\u2019t the only stingy ones here.", "YTA - Other people saving money \"irks\" you?", "I don\u2019t really know if I want to label YTA but I think it\u2019s very strange to point out they\u2019re \u201cstingy\u201d while several red flags also seem to say that about y\u2019all. Who hawks a mattress they\u2019ve used for that long regardless of what it was wrapped in. I would not use anything like that that someone else slept on repeatedly.", "NTA because it sounds like husband just threw out a price without thought. Since they already paid and took it,  you can definitely offer some of the money back and just explain that you had a chance to see what it was actually  worth and you have no desire to overcharge. Unlike your husband, be sure to talk to him about this first, others you're opening a whole new can of worms.", "I'd say you're not the AH. Maybe it could have been more clear that you intended to sell it instead of using the wording \"get rid of it\" to make it clear you were expecting money. If you feel bad you could still give some of the money back and explain it was a honest mistake. Everybody can make mistakes.", "NTA. You have to be explicit in this situations with anyone. Getting rid of implies free. Getting rid of and will sale is clear language. \n\nStop offering them XYZ if it\u2019s contentious. \n\nA used mattress is a used mattress. I would venture that the depreciation would have lowered that price further than your unclear offer. \n\nDraw better boundaries and keep the piece.", "NAH - he agreed to pay a reasonable amount for a mattress. It was probably more than he wanted to pay, but still cheaper than new.", "ESH. You and your husband for selling a 5 YEAR OLD mattress for $700 and your BIL for being an idiot and paying that much for a used mattress.  I like honesty, so I would return  some of the money back.", "Nah Was the original price of the mattress reduced for buy it as part of a set? Either way they could have passed or looked up the value themselves. They might have and seen the price without the discount for buying a set", "You're NTA because *you* didn't overcharge him. Your husband, without any discussion with you, threw a price out there and BIL accepted. You didn't knowingly overcharge him. If your husband did, then he's TA, and you can certainly talk to your husband about offering to return some of BIL's money, but you're NTA nor are you responsible for your husband's actions.", "NTA.  It sounds like shopping for a new high quality mattress you guys assumed the old one cost that much and charged accordingly.  You charged a high price on a bad assumption.\n\nNow that you see how cheap the mattress was I think you should refund a majority.  You were charging $700 for something you thought cost 2k.  It cost less than half that. A couple hundred bucks is more than fair for what you had.", "NAH, your husband (his own brother) put the price down, not you, and his brother agreed on it. Don't mention it further.", "NAH  but now that you are aware, refunding some money would be a good thing to do.", "NTA. Your BIL was dumb for paying so much for a five year old used mattress. That's on him for not doing basic research. You took full advantage and that's a crappy thing to do to someone who is family.", "NTA\n\nHe was happy to pay $700 for a 5 year old mattress. It would've been great considering he tested it.", "NTA, I\u2019m sure he most likely owes you a few bucks here and there.", "NTA. He could\u2019ve rejected the price if he deemed it too pricey. He accepted. No need to make a big deal out of it", "BIL got BIL-NTA just remember this every time he is cheap with you.", "NTAGiving back money will only make it worse. \n\nBUT there is no mattress that has been used for 5 years and is in great shape. The case literally means nothing. If you put your phone on a case and still use it daily for 5 years, it will be a phone that has been used a lot but is on a nice case.", "NTA. The very foundation of capitalism - and with it all that is sacred in our society - is the principle of maximizing revenue. Get the most that you can out of a customer/client/supplier/business partner.", "NTA and I would just let it go. He paid WELL below what a decent king mattress costs right now. I just bought a queen bed last year, a decent one, and paid 2K for it. I wouldn't say anything either. you were looking to sell it, he was willing (sort of) to pay what you asked, done deal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Give him some money back. Say hey it's actually a bit more devalued than we thought here's some cash back have a great day family member.", "YTA. No one is paying that much for a used mattress. Look up the market for used mattresses, you won't find it because there is no market. You and your husband essentially \"took advantage\" of your BIL and he will likely be weary of accepting any \"freebies\" or gifts from you guys now.", "Ewww this is gross to do to your own family. YTA.", "YTA. Used mattresses have almost no resale value. You claim you'd list it for $850, but I'd be shocked if you got $200", "YTA. You took advantage of your family.

A 5 year old mattress for 700$ is insane.", "Agree on the BIL being an idiot part. You can find a decent mattress brand new for $700. I say OP is not the AH though because she didn't throw that price out, her husband did.", "I don\u2019t know about this. It seems like the BIL only paid so as to not make the situation awkward. This is the kind of thing that can kill a relationship. \n\nThis is like someone offering you help moving something with their truck and then hitting you with a bill later.

Sorry if it feels like attacking, it\u2019s not meant to be.\n\nThe thing is that sometimes you accept raw deals or don\u2019t protest little indiscretions in order to keep the peace. We have a friend from college who consistently shows up to parties 4 hours late (and wants to stay long after everyone else has gone); once at a BBQ his wife came with a single serving side dish for herself (it was regular baked beans, not like some sort of restricted diet food), helped herself to our kitchen to heat them without cleaning up, and sat on the couch (the chaise part kind where you put your legs up) with her boots on. \n\nWe didn\u2019t make a scene about any of this, we just don\u2019t invite them anymore.", "BIL isn't a FB marketplace stranger, they have an ongoing relationship. So it's not \"done\". The bad feelings will linger and impact things between them going forward. If OP is okay with this fine...I wouldn't feel good about it.\n\nBIL seems not that bright. No one else is going to pay $700 for a used mattress. It does make you an ass to take advantage of someone's idiocy if you claim to care about that person."]}
