It was still in great shape, and had been in a waterproof, hypoallergenic case the entire time we owned it. We figured we could get some decent money for it.\n\nMy brother-in-law had mentioned a while back that he and his wife were looking for a different king-size mattress, so on a whim, I just threw out there that we were getting rid of ours. He gladly accepted our offer to try it out.\n\nBack story - I love my BIL and his wife, we get along pretty well. However, they are very, VERY stingy people and often take advantage of other people's generosity and any other ways they can save a quick buck. I'm all for being smart with money, but when they do it to the detriment of others, it irks me.\n\nAnyway, they came over to try out the mattress, liked it, and asked my husband to help them load it up. I then asked if it would be easier for them to pay cash, or to just Venmo us. BIL was confused, and thought we were offering to \"give\" them the mattress. Thankfully, husband backed me up and said the mattress was in great condition and we're going to sell it elsewhere if they didn't want to buy it.\n\nOn the spot, husband said we would list it for $850, but BIL could have it for $700 if he took it now. I honestly hadn't even looked back at how much we paid for the mattress brand new, but just went with my husbands offer. BIL reluctantly accepted, and kept making comments about how WE were being unreasonable in charging \"family\", that we were being greedy, etc.\n\nAnyway, he paid the $700 and they have the mattress.\n\nA few days later, I got our statement for our new mattress, and out of curiosity, looked back in our account to see what the previous mattress costed us. It was then that I realized we had actually only paid $950 for the previous mattress - so after 5 years, we had only reduced the price by $250. To me, I felt that **was** a little greedy on our part, and now I'm feeling guilt because I'm NOT someone that likes to take advantage of others for a quick buck. I haven't told anyone else this, for fear of starting a disagreement.\n\nSo, AITA for what I believe to be \"overcharging\" my BIL?\n\nShould I give him some money back?

At least based off what you said, you told them that you were \"getting rid\" of it. I feel that is safe to assume it was an offer of, this would cost money to take to the dump, wanna save us the money and take our old mattress?

It would have to be the mattress plus bedframe and bedroom set like dressers and nightstand for it to possibly get that expensive. Even then the bedroom set would have to be really nice", "YTA. You thought you could make \"good money\" on a five-year-old used mattress that only cost 950 to begin with? Seriously?", "YTA. $700 for a USED mattress? And you sprung that on him when he came to pick it up? Even in a cover or whatnot, you're \"recommended\" to replace your mattress every 8 years (I think that's just Mattress Firm trying to justify having a store on every corner). I would be sending back most if not all of that money because you ripped them off. To be fair, you got most of the lifetime use out of that mattress and if you had listed that anywhere there's little to no chance you'd have found someone to pay basically new pricing for a very used mattress. I can order a brand new king sized Nectar mattress for $899 right now, and have it delivered to my door, and that's the most expensive thing showing up on a quick google search.", "YTA.  You should have made it clear from the start how much you wanted for it. You and your husband could have saved the embarrassment / tension by simply looking this up beforehand. Hopefully your BIL won\u2019t try to research the price or things might get more awkward.", "YTA \nIs there seriously a market for used mattresses? Charging family for a five year old mattress is bonkers. And then you have the gall to act like THEY\u2019RE the cheap ones?! \ud83d\ude10", "I\u2019m not stingy but I\u2019m the kind of person that wouldn\u2019t spend more than $500-$700 new on a mattress. It\u2019s just the price range i feel comfortable with. $700 5 years used? Oof.\n\nYa kinda suck, you should have told him the price up front before offering so he could research if it\u2019s worth it or in his family\u2019s budget.\n\nGive the guy $1-200 because you love him, please.", "Since it\u2019s your BIL, and someone you will have a life long relationship, call him up and say, \u201c I thought we paid more for the mattress, here is some money back\u201d it\u2019s probably fair to charge him about 1/2 of what you paid.  It\u2019s not a good plan to argue over small peanuts with family.", "YTA give them a surprise refund and everyone smiles.", "NTA. \n\nyou didn't even remember what it cost but your husband thought it was a fair price and he was the one whoe decided not to let HIS BROTHER take advantage of you both. \n\nYour husband knew what HIS brother was doing and that he was going to try and negotiate this down to the lowest possible amount. Otherwise he'd complain to mommy and daddy. \n\nMost good quality mattresses are in the thousands. My husband would consider a good mattress that's still in the packaging, or even hypo allergenic packaging, that's still in near perfect condition after 5years. A steal. \n\nHe got a really good deal. Theirs nobreason to be upset about that. \n\nThe time from purchase doesn't matter. Because the mattress was like new, so you have every right to recouped most if not all the money you spent. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Bil shouldn't expect to get crap for free just because he's family. That's bull crap. \n\nYou dont give away a new mattress, you give away crap ones.", "YTA, who the fuck charges family for a 5 year old mattress", "YTA", "YTA - when most stores deliver your new mattress, included is the free removal of the old one.  No one, except some stingy, nasty person would try to sell an old mattress.  Normal people would pay to have it removed.  The BIL probably accepted the outrageous offer to not embarrass his wife or avoid a family spat.  I would have told you to shove it.  Give him back his $700 and apologize for the douchery.", "You are the seller, he is the buyer.  Ypu set the price not him.  If he doesn't want to pay the cost you set. He doesn't need to. He could have researched for something better before paying you.", "YTA for not doing your research before your bil came to test the mattress. It is very reasonable to expect they would have made a decision if they wanted it or not when they came over. Screwing over family always comes back to bite you in the butt", "YTA. A USED mattress? And you call HIM stingy? He\u2019s a complete idiot for going along with this, but you \u2026 idk what you are. This is bizarre all around.", "YTA for not checking the price, however I actually think giving money and telling him might make it worse. Give them something else or help them out elsewhere", "YTA.  Give back all of the money.  All. Of. It. You weren\u2019t clear up front that you were selling the mattress, and then after they were at your house and were hooked, you pulled a fast one by then letting them know it\u2019s for sale and charging way more than you should have.  A used mattress that old is not even worth $50.  It doesn\u2019t matter you\u2019ve had it in plastic.  Your body weights have worn down the structure of the mattress and it\u2019s within a couple of years of the end of its lifespan. You didn\u2019t have to pay the dump fee because they took it off your hands.\n\nCalling your BIL stingy?  Hello, Kettle, you\u2019re black.\n\nDo the right thing.  If you had actually done any research ahead of time, you\u2019d have known the true value of the mattress is less than the dump fee and you\u2019d have been happy to give it away.", "Sold a used mattress to your BIL. You should be paying him to haul it away.\n\nYTA - be clear in your communication. If you're selling anything, then agree to the price BEFORE the buyer shows up, otherwise you're using some questionable business practices on your own family.", "ESH.  YTA for selling a 5 year old mattress to family.  Maybe asking for a treat out to dinner and have him pick it up himself would have been a more appropriate trade.\n\nYour brother and his wife are gross for wanting to sleep on a mattress his sister banged on for 5+ years.  It doesn\u2019t matter that it was covered.  That thing definitely got worn in over the half decade you had to get busy on it.  It\u2019s so weird he would even consider paying that for a used mattress when there are so many quality new mattresses out there for the same or less.", " NAH. You acted in a way tou wouldn't have done if you'd had more info. The dight thing to do is refund your BIL a good bit of money, because a 5 year old mattress that cost $850 to begin with isn't worth all that much..", "NTA \n\nSounds like BIL had already been looking for a mattress prior to this exchange. I am going to assume he knew what the price was for a new mattress and was budgeting. There was nothing in this post that suggested he had to take the deal. He thought it was going to be given freely and once he knew it wasn\u2019t he had the choice; take it or leave it. There wasn\u2019t any coercion to take it.\n\nIf OP is so bothered by the way this played out, offer to but it back and then sell it as they had originally planned and then BIL can go on about purchasing a new mattress at a price he is truly comfortable with.", "> I'm all for being smart with money, but when they do it to the detriment of others, it irks me.\n\nSounds like you\u2019re describing your own behavior here. \n\n$700 for a 5 year old mattress is a rip off. \n\nI\u2019m honestly wondering which one of you is the stingy couple, because certainly from this encounter, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve giving a fair portrayal. \n\nYTA", "NTA, but I\u2019d definitely give him some money back. \n\nFor a 5 year old mattress that cost around a grand, I fell mine 500 bucks is fair. Send him 200 bucks and just tell him the truth: we thought it cost a lot more than it actually did. Here\u2019s 200 bucks back. It\u2019ll make everyone feel better", "Of course YTA, but that was the point wasn\u2019t it? You told us he was an ah and you thought he deserved some of his own medicine because he was so stingy.", "I\u2019m confused. It sounds like you told BIL that they could have your old mattress and only asked for money after it was loaded on the truck.  I also would have assumed it was a gift.  Because I would never charge a family member for a 5 year old used mattress.  If you didn\u2019t mention charging them for it until it was already loaded on the truck then YTA.", "How do you get as far as loading it on a trailer and asking whether it was card or cash BEFORE discussing the price?! This makes no sense.", "I do agree with you that they way, way overcharged the BIL, but as someone who is freshly back from mattress shopping (having paid 4k for a higher-end but not top of the line mattress, the \"high end\" kings/queens are in the 5-6k range right now. And that's at mattress firm. the \"nice\" stores had mattresses for 10k. It's fucking awful.", "High end king-size mattresses absolutely are way more than $2k. Mine was $2500 and it was one of the cheapest all-latex mattress options I found.\n\nThat being said, I don't disagree with anything else you said. Especially since this was apparently a $950 king-size mattress, it would obviously have not been particularly valuable 5 years on.", "Agreed. That mattress is already halfway through its 10-year life cycle. That's mad expensive for an old mattress. YTA indeed.", "YTA - you offered it to them, no mention of selling it.  They came over, liked it, loaded it into their truck and THEN you mentioned price.  Talk about a classic bait and switch.  What did you expect them to do?  \n\n700 is a lot to drop unexpectedly.  I would probably plan to make a purchase like that on my card - there\u2019s no way I could just drop that much from my checking account without planning, I hope your family isn\u2019t in the same boat as I am.\n\nedit - sorry didn\u2019t mean this as a reply to your comment.", "Yeah, I think they should send some money back.", "This! BIL could have asked for a day to think about it if he felt $700 was too much. It\u2019s his issue for having buyer\u2019s remorse.", "I was wondering about the state law part\u2026 in my state, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s legal to resell mattresses. At least I\u2019ve heard mattress stores say they can\u2019t sell returned mattresses just in case there are bedbugs. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a couple sold by individuals, but never more than $50-100. I figured they were trying to unload them cheap and quick since it wasn\u2019t legal, but I don\u2019t actually know the laws for individual sellers. \n\n$700 for a 5 year old mattress seems like a complete rip off though.", "I'm not defending OP, I think the price they got for a 5 year old mattress is ridiculous, but that's not what the OP said at all\n\n> I'm all for being smart with money, but when they do it to the detriment of others, it irks me.", "Exactly. The projection here is incredible.", "Same, I'd give them back half of it and say I realized it wasn't worth as much as i thought, and i didn't want to be unfair. They get to be happy they get some money back and there are no hard feelings. OP didn't have to go through the trouble of listing the mattress (and relisting it at a lower price when it doesnt sell) and finding a buyer who will actually show up with a properly sized vehicle. It's a win win.", "*Card* or cash?\n\nDo you think they have a credit card machine to ring in sales at their home?", "I was looking for this comment. High end mattress are quite a bit more than 2k. We just purchased a king sized mid upper end and it was around 3k. I was shocked at how expensive quality mattresses are.", "Right?? Feels like it was a bait and switch lol. Sheesh. Who needs enemies when you have family like this?!", "No, it\u2019s not at all the same as the moving situation you brought up. They had not taken the mattress yet. Instead of saying no, they accepted the price without negotiating and took what they paid for. They were not \u201cgiven\u201d the mattress only to be charged later. The seller was clear about the price before any exchange took place.", "BIL didn't have to accept the offer", "Yeah getting rid of and selling it have strong emphasis on \"I don't want it in my house\" Vs \"I want money for it\"", "I suppose strictly speaking it would be more like offering to help and not saying you\u2019re intention was to get paid until you show up on the day of. It\u2019s still a bait and switch under the *cover of etiquette.* If you hired a moving company and they showed up and told you hey by the way there\u2019s an extra $100 charge you\u2019d tell them to get lost. For friends and family we often grin and bear it in order to not start a family feud.", "It\u2019s hard for me to believe that OP and her husband didn\u2019t look up what a reasonable market price for a used mattress is since they knew they were going to try to sell it and not gift it even if BIL didn\u2019t buy it."]}
