It's stupid anyway, concrete frequently has to be repaired and replaced.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not her property.\n\nIf they were laying concrete on the public sidewalk she wouldn't be allowed to do that. She's delusional in thinking her kids should be allowed to do that to YOUR property.", "NTA. Since when did it become ok to \"make precious childhood memories\" on someone else's property? Fuck all that.", "NTA. If she wants them to have \"precious childhood memories\", she can pay to have pavement poured on her own property. The absolute entitlement it takes to demand her demons to vandalize your yard is astonishing.", "Precious childhood memories are shoving sticks and rocks into wet concrete???? Like I get writing your name but just shoving random shit into it? It doesn't compute.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThey are disrespectful little s**TS, and so are their parents. If they want \"precious childhood memories\" in concrete, they can pour their own. \n Seriously despise people like that.  Check your concrete, for damage. If it's there, bill them for materials and labor, to repair.", "I\u2019ve heard of doing that on a public sidewalk, but if you\u2019re talking about private property. That\u2019s insane. \n\nThat mom can fuck right off. Nta.", "Also concrete is caustic and can cause nasty burns on skin - who'd be in the shit if one of those kids had a reaction from sticking their hands in wet cement? Not their parents, that's for sure.", "Lol what? This is A classic American custom dating back to the 50s. I would dare any of you to call the cops on them. Have yall not really seen handprints in concrete before?\n\n Huge YTA, my gawd curmudggeoen is exactly the prefect word in this scenario, it's such a harmless and cute custom, let kids be kids ffs. \n\nI bet some of you would cry about people carving their inishuls into a tree too \ud83d\ude44 it ain't harm nobody", "r/entitledparents", "lmao what? on someone else\u2019s PRIVATE property? good lord, people like you \ud83d\ude2c hope you don\u2019t have kids tbh. not everyone is okay with some random persons kids destroying THEIR shit.", "If I saw some random kids carving into a tree on my property I would promptly tell them to gtfo???? We\u2019re talking private property not public sidewalks, get real", "This has to be bait no way you're this dumb", "I thought this was usually done on public streets though? Not someone's private property", "Can I just make a point about this?\u2026\n\n> who may want to go back and look at their initials and palm prints one day and \"reminisce.\"\n\nSo this mom not only thinks her kids had a right to go on your private property uninvited and vandalize your freshly poured concrete walkway, but she thinks they have a right to access your property, in perpetuity, in order to \u201creminisce\u201d?! \n\nTL;DR: Tell this lady to go pound sand and keep her brats off your lawn.", "More than this delusional mom was giving you grief?", "A big ass bag 60lb of ready to mix sand/topping mix costs less than ten bucks.  The kids could make handprints and footprints and twig and leaf impressions galore, in *their* yard.  Of course, the mother would have get off her dead ass and do it with them.", "When I was a kid, my grandparents lived in the town near where I currently live. I did not live here when they lived here, but we visited frequently. I remember their house and neighborhood fondly and made lots of memories there. I still occasionally drive by their old house because feelings. \n\nAs much as I would absolutely love to be in their old house again, I'm not going to just march up to the front door and tell the current owners that my grandparents lived there 30+ years ago so I need to be let in for a tour.", "Did you also tell them to leave or call the police?", "It wasn\u2019t just hand prints. It was various types of debris too.", "Never too early to teach em to pour concrete", "That might start a war lol", "Depends on your perspective, but they def. did it a weird way. When I was a kid, we got a knock on the door a couple times from people who'd live in the house 10, 20 years ago. One wanted to know if it was okay to go in the backyard and see if 'that old thing' they'd put up was still there (it was a circle of stones, classic fire circle, that my sister and I made pretend fires on). The other wanted to come in and Relive Old Memories for a while. My parents were okay with the first, and the second, asked them to come back the next day so they could be around for the whole visit (and make us all clean first).\n\nSimilarly, when I was 12 we visited the place we'd moved away from when I was a toddler, and my sister really wanted to go see Our Old House. My parents told her we could knock on the door and ask, but if they said no, then we couldn't. (She'd carved her name and date on the inside of her closet before we moved, I don't know \\*how\\* she was about 5, but she wanted to see if it was still there). Some people really enjoy going 'this is where I grew up, this is where things I remember happened, this is where I was happy' and showing it to others if they have the chance.\n\nThe key point here, though, is consent. Getting the home owner's permission (and taking 'they're not home' as a 'no') was the most important step. The entitlement of that mom, sheesh.", "I mean, I'll occasionally drive by the house I grew up in, just to see if anyone's done anything either with it or to it, but I would never do something like that.", "I was going to wrap their paws in baggies and then spend a few decades saying \"those shapeless blobs are from the dogs\" lol", "Yeah, if I happen to be nearby the neighborhood where I grew up, I'll drive by to see how the outside has changed. But I'd never try to go into the yard.", "advice/heads up: maybe avoid this if you live in an area with snow. Water gets in those prints and freezes and the prints/area around it can get a ton of cracks in/around it. Same principle as potholes: water gets in a crack, freezes, expands, breaks the cement around it, making a bigger area for more water to get into and freeze, etc."]}
