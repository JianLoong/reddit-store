He's been with my sister for 6 years and it's only recently that our relationship has gone down the drain.\n\nFor some context, when John was 19, him and his ex-girlfriend (Jane) were having a baby. Unfortunately, she died at 2 months old due to severe birth complications. John and Jane broke up but every year on the baby's birthday, they meet up for lunch. Since meeting my sister, John also throws a small gathering for the family to come to. Obviously none of us met the baby, but it's more for support since Jane moved countries and he doesn't have much family. \n\nWhen I was 16, my boyfriend died. It was very sudden and nothing could have predicted it. One day he was here, the next he wasn't. I'm in therapy and grief counselling. \n\nThe issue is that in the past 2 years, John has turned grief into a competition. Which really hurts because I used to look up to him as a role model, especially when it came to grief and moving on. But he can't just let me be sad about my boyfriend. He has to bring up how he lost a child which is 'sooooooo much woooooorse'. \n\nNow, I want to be clear, I've never lost a child. I've never been pregnant or lost a pregnancy so I cannot pretend to know what it feels like, but I'm sick of him lording it over me. For example, there was a period of time last year where I lost my appetite and John says 'When I lost my baby, I couldn't eat, either. I had lost a part of me. You just lost a \\~person\\~. You weren't connected. So it's not as bad.'\n\nThe party is happening in early June and I'm invited but I told my mum and sister that I don't want to go and explained why. My mum and sister got very upset and said I was making a mountain out of a molehill and that I need to put this pettiness behind me for John. They both said it would be douchey of me not to come.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684323338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jz63i/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_bils_daughters/", "score": 5851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Him telling you \"you just lost a \\~person\\~\" is disgusting and cruel. As someone who is also experiencing grief, he should have been there to support not demean you.\n\nI'm just going to throw this in there too...the whole party thing. For 13 years he's been throwing this \"event\" on the baby's birthday. Why? It doesn't sound like it's helping his grief so is it just for attention so that he can be sure to remind everyone his loss is greater than anything they could have experienced?", "For 13 years he has been hosting a wake for a dead baby? I don\u2019t think you need to feed into that.", "NTA and trust your instinct on this. \n\nDoes your presence help John? No, obviously not. Does your presence help you? No, John sees to it that your presence makes things worse for you. \n\nJohn is an AH for making this a competition. Your sister and mom are AHs for calling you \"petty\" or \"douchey\". You are not an AH if you refuse to go somewhere that you will just be mistreated.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds appalling. Like you say: it's not a competition. Maybe it was worse for him, doesn't mean it is not terrible for you. Seems suffering has not taught him anything, not empathy anyway. You can't deal with people like that.", "You\u2019re not obligated to attend any family gathering. That doesn\u2019t seem like a person I would want to hang out with.

Grief is individual experience that is valid and shouldn't be belittled or compared. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nI am struggling to understand your BIL's behaviour really.  I can understand that to him and his ex, the loss was and still is very painful. I can understand that some people will continue to memorialise their loss for years.  However 13 years later, to be involving an extended family that had no connection to that time of his life, is just really weird.\n\nLosing a child is one of my greatest fears, i have known people who lost their children in primary school, and it is devastating. I've known many, including myself, who have suffered miscarriages who have to defend their grieving because some don't consider that to be a real loss  But to constantly tell other people that have been bereaved, that their loss is not as important and is not as hard, is cruel and tactless and belittling. It most certainly isn't a competition.", "NTA\n\nPeople like this are horrible.\n\n(fyi cameron geller on yt makes very good shorts, hardship one uppers among them)", "NTA\n\nthat's not grieving for grief that's grieving for attention\n\nit's almost narcissistic", "NTA. Everyone experiences grief differently and it isn't a contest. Sounds like you don't really have the emotional energy to support him during the memorial.

He has berated me, belittled me, and turned grief into a competition.  He has gone from someone I admired to (Sister's) bedwarmer, and as a result I have less than zero obligation to him.  He can host his yearly wake, but I am not required to attend, or even acknowledge, it and if either of you try to force the issue you can do so in counseling where a professional can explain to you exactly how wrong you are to force this man's mental and emotional abuse onto me.", "NTA. The energy he expends to dick-measure grief is better used elsewhere. After my grandma lost her daughter (my mom), she worked hard to move on. She strives to be happy for her remaining kids and grandkids, and tells us of how proud she is of her daughter in the little time that she had in this world. She would occasionally tear up when reminiscing. She doesn't have the emotional bandwidth to lord her grief over others.", "NTA.\n\nLosing someone is always hard, and everyone grieves in their own way, but downplaying another's sorrow is just a dick move. Losing a person, big or small, does not give you the authority to judge another person's loss.", "NTA- do not go", "NTA and this is a little extreme.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with him having a memorial service, if that's something that helps him then fine. What's bizarre is his HORRIBLE comments to you! Grief is absolutely not a competition. It's gut wrenching he lost an infant, its also gut wrenching you lost your boyfriend suddenly - especially during your formative years.\n\n\nI know reddit as a whole can be dramatic but your BIL is toxic and immature. His comments almost make it sound like he uses his dead child as a way to get attention which is creepy and a horrible way to honor a life lost. I'd really love to know how he would act around someone else that's lost a child. Would be try and one up them too?\n\nIt's okay to keep your distance OP. Be kind when you have to spend time but I wouldn't spend any additional time with this person. He will not help you heal.", "NTA for skipping.

I\u2019m sure that your sister would hope your BIL would stop this morbid tradition.", "NTA.\n\nSeems like John is using his grief as an excuse to be a total dick. Some people are like that. I'm so sorry for your loss.  Losing any loved one is incredibly painful.", "NTA - I mean, I know I wouldn't go.", "NTA. I am 61 years old.  I have had to bury both my parents, my husband, my best friend and several friends and family members.  I can tell you for a fact, that competitive behavior is not normal. It isn't healthy, and your family is enabling it.", "NTA. I also lost a baby at two and a half months. It was agonizing in a way I can\u2019t even put into words. It always will be agonizing. But what your BIL is doing isn\u2019t healthy, and it\u2019s actually inexcusable that your mother and sister are going along with it. \n\nDistance yourself and take care of yourself. What you are going through is also agonizing.", "First of all, I am so sorry you lost your boyfriend as such a young age. I understand you BIL is still hurting because of the loss of his child but that does not give him the right to undermine your pain! Grief should never be a competition, it\u2019s always hard to lose someone who you care about no matter who the person is. He is the AH for saying your loss wasn\u2019t as bad. Just because he lost a child, which I am truly sorry he did, does not give him the right to say his loss is worse than yours.\n\nI just want to know how close are you with your sister? Because if you are close and if you chose to not go that could potentially really hurt your relationship with your sister.

I can\u2019t even pretend to know what it\u2019s like to lose a child.  However I still wouldn\u2019t attend his party.\n\nThis is going to come off as rude and a bit much but this really gets under my skin. I loathe when people compare pain. Especially loss. The baby was technically not around for even a year. He should have stopped throwing himself his literal annual pity party when ex moved away. It\u2019s okay to grieve, but to compare it?! I\u2019m assuming your bf was also 16? A 16 year old 4 years ago versus a 2mo 13 years ago. \n\nIf he\u2019s so he\u2019ll bent on comparing pain, which should never happen, and you are being guilted into going, which don\u2019t if you wanna, then remind him how long ago versus you and how much more of an impact your boyfriend had on the world and how many lives he touched and moved. How about you invite your bf\u2019s parents so they can hear what your BIL has to say about your pain versus his.", "NTA for not wanting to go. You are not obligated. \n\nI am sorry for your loss and hope you find peace and happiness in your life. \n\nThere was no need to continue the grief competition by spelling it all out to your mum and sister though. You could've just quietly rsvped as not going and left them all to their memorial anniversary.", "NTA his grieving isn\u2019t healthy and you are in no way obligated to go to some silly function for someone you don\u2019t care for", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ve lost a child. He was 7months. It\u2019s fucking heartbreaking, but there is a trend among some loss parents that their grief is the only grief in the world that matters. It\u2019s frustrating and makes loss parents look shitty. \nHis grief theatrics are just that- theatrics. He is allowed to grieve but attempting to put your family vs you in a grief competition is disgusting and just shows it\u2019s an attention grab.", "Nta. I have lost a baby, to miscarriage.  I have also lost a 14 year old niece. I didn't know anything about the baby. I knew everything about my neice. We lived across the road from each other and were very close. The pain of losing my neice was/is far greater, because I had memories of her, was used to her presence, her laugh, her likes and dislikes. and I missed her so much, still do, 10 years later. I never missed the baby as I never knew it.", "NTA\n\nWhile having an annual party where people who don\u2019t know the dead person it isn\u2019t how I choose to grieve everyone grieves differently.

He kept sobbing and saying no parent should ever bury their son. He did this every day until he died.\n\nI don't think your BIL is trying to turn this into a grief competition. Grandpa was able to watch his son grow up, have a life, have a family. Your BIL did not even have that opportunity when he buried his child. \n\nYou do not need to attend this birthday party.

I've never seen people in so much pain.\n\nHis girlfriend was also absolutely broken. They'd been together for a year and obviously loved each other a lot. She was devastated when he died.\n\nThe entire family, his friends, everyone who loved him came together, and it hurt for all of us in different ways, but it hurt like hell for those closest to him. Nobody was ever so much of a dick that they compared their grief. Nobody told his friends, \"Oh, it's okay for you because I'm his sibling.\" His parents didn't compare their grief with his girlfriend. Some of his closest friends had only known him for a couple of months, and yet to this day\u2014seven years later\u2014they come to his parents' house for memorial events for him. Everyone loved him and everyone lost him.\n\nLosing a child is unimaginable for all sorts of reasons, but losing a partner is very different\u2014better in some ways, but worse in others. Your partner is your support, your best friend, your companion in life. You have built a deep, rich, emotionally in-tune connection with them, in a way you never will with a child. A child, meanwhile, is a life investment. You will do anything for your child, but it is not an equal relationship. It is extremely different. Unimaginably painful to lose in either scenario, but very different.\n\nLosing a partner is just very different from losing a child, and it can really break you. To say that it's \"not that bad\" because \"I've lost a child\"...no. That is such BS. Losing a partner is extremely traumatic; there's a reason why people will literally commit suicide rather than continue to live without their partners. And to dismiss your pain like that, because he went through a loss that he considers to be \"worse\"? No.\n\nFurthermore, to throw parties so that he gets a proper amount of attention because he lost a child is pretty attention-seeking and kind of nuts. Grief does not give you an excuse to be an asshole, and you are not obligated to take his shit.\n\nPeople try to compare loss in all sorts of ways, and it's stupid every single time. If one person's child died when the child was 4, and another's child died when the child was 16, then the parent of the 4-year-old might tell the other parent, \"Oh, it was worse for me because they were so much younger and had more life to live,\" while the other one would say that it was worse for them because they knew their child much better and had an emotionally closer relationship with them. If one person lost someone suddenly (such as in the case with my cousin, or your boyfriend), and another lost them after a long battle with an illness, the illness person might say that it was worse for them because they had to slowly watch their loved one die, while the sudden loss one might say it was worse because they had no warning and no way to mentally prepare themselves. Each loss is different\u2014better in some ways and worse in others\u2014but each loss is a loss. It affects each person differently. No situation is the same, and two people might mourn the same person very differently. My experiences with grief have taught me just how stupid, useless, and ridiculous it is to try to ever compare different grief experiences.", "NTA by a long shot, OP. \n\nYou have every right to grieve your own loss at your own pace in your own way without anyone else's input.

I love him very much, but my mother did literally everything for him, including creating a world in which he was infallible, where he was the funniest, smartest most incredible person in any room.

He may live in terror that if he doesn't organise this party then no one will remember his baby and the day will just pass like any other.

His pain doesn't excuse him hurting you, so you're well within your rights not to go. It would be kind to find another way to remember his child, e.g. by sending a card or making a donation in their name and letting him know, but that's up to you.

Caving to her family's demands over her own feelings and conclusions is reinforcing a habit of allowing her family to cross her boundaries. It is her choice to attend the memorial or not and she should not be bullied into it. 2) While I agree OP needs to communicate her boundaries with her BIL on competing with her grief, it would be inappropriate to do so at a memorial, where the actively grieving are given special allowance to feel their grief. OP has made an informed risk assessment that her BIL will already trigger this unpleasantness, so purposely going with the intent of communicating her displeasure with his behavior is sure to invite conflict among everyone present and within the family. 3) It is highly likely BIL will not respect the request.

Send a card instead.
