He's been with my sister for 6 years and it's only recently that our relationship has gone down the drain.\n\nFor some context, when John was 19, him and his ex-girlfriend (Jane) were having a baby. Unfortunately, she died at 2 months old due to severe birth complications. John and Jane broke up but every year on the baby's birthday, they meet up for lunch. Since meeting my sister, John also throws a small gathering for the family to come to. Obviously none of us met the baby, but it's more for support since Jane moved countries and he doesn't have much family. \n\nWhen I was 16, my boyfriend died. It was very sudden and nothing could have predicted it. One day he was here, the next he wasn't. I'm in therapy and grief counselling. \n\nThe issue is that in the past 2 years, John has turned grief into a competition. Which really hurts because I used to look up to him as a role model, especially when it came to grief and moving on. But he can't just let me be sad about my boyfriend. He has to bring up how he lost a child which is 'sooooooo much woooooorse'. \n\nNow, I want to be clear, I've never lost a child. I've never been pregnant or lost a pregnancy so I cannot pretend to know what it feels like, but I'm sick of him lording it over me. For example, there was a period of time last year where I lost my appetite and John says 'When I lost my baby, I couldn't eat, either. I had lost a part of me. You just lost a \\~person\\~. You weren't connected. So it's not as bad.'\n\nThe party is happening in early June and I'm invited but I told my mum and sister that I don't want to go and explained why. My mum and sister got very upset and said I was making a mountain out of a molehill and that I need to put this pettiness behind me for John. They both said it would be douchey of me not to come.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684323338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jz63i/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_bils_daughters/", "score": 439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Him telling you \"you just lost a \\~person\\~\" is disgusting and cruel. As someone who is also experiencing grief, he should have been there to support not demean you.\n\nI'm just going to throw this in there too...the whole party thing. For 13 years he's been throwing this \"event\" on the baby's birthday. Why? It doesn't sound like it's helping his grief so is it just for attention so that he can be sure to remind everyone his loss is greater than anything they could have experienced?", "For 13 years he has been hosting a wake for a dead baby? I don\u2019t think you need to feed into that.", "NTA and trust your instinct on this. \n\nDoes your presence help John? No, obviously not. Does your presence help you? No, John sees to it that your presence makes things worse for you. \n\nJohn is an AH for making this a competition. Your sister and mom are AHs for calling you \"petty\" or \"douchey\". You are not an AH if you refuse to go somewhere that you will just be mistreated.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds appalling. Like you say: it's not a competition. Maybe it was worse for him, doesn't mean it is not terrible for you. Seems suffering has not taught him anything, not empathy anyway. You can't deal with people like that.", "You\u2019re not obligated to attend any family gathering. That doesn\u2019t seem like a person I would want to hang out with.

I can understand that to him and his ex, the loss was and still is very painful. I can understand that some people will continue to memorialise their loss for years.  However 13 years later, to be involving an extended family that had no connection to that time of his life, is just really weird.\n\nLosing a child is one of my greatest fears, i have known people who lost their children in primary school, and it is devastating. I've known many, including myself, who have suffered miscarriages who have to defend their grieving because some don't consider that to be a real loss  But to constantly tell other people that have been bereaved, that their loss is not as important and is not as hard, is cruel and tactless and belittling. It most certainly isn't a competition.", "NTA\n\nPeople like this are horrible.\n\n(fyi cameron geller on yt makes very good shorts, hardship one uppers among them)", "NTA\n\nthat's not grieving for grief that's grieving for attention\n\nit's almost narcissistic", "NTA. Everyone experiences grief differently and it isn't a contest. Sounds like you don't really have the emotional energy to support him during the memorial.

He has berated me, belittled me, and turned grief into a competition.  He has gone from someone I admired to (Sister's) bedwarmer, and as a result I have less than zero obligation to him.  He can host his yearly wake, but I am not required to attend, or even acknowledge, it and if either of you try to force the issue you can do so in counseling where a professional can explain to you exactly how wrong you are to force this man's mental and emotional abuse onto me.", "NTA. The energy he expends to dick-measure grief is better used elsewhere. After my grandma lost her daughter (my mom), she worked hard to move on. She strives to be happy for her remaining kids and grandkids, and tells us of how proud she is of her daughter in the little time that she had in this world. She would occasionally tear up when reminiscing. She doesn't have the emotional bandwidth to lord her grief over others.", "NTA.\n\nLosing someone is always hard, and everyone grieves in their own way, but downplaying another's sorrow is just a dick move. Losing a person, big or small, does not give you the authority to judge another person's loss.", "NTA- do not go", "NTA and this is a little extreme.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with him having a memorial service, if that's something that helps him then fine. What's bizarre is his HORRIBLE comments to you! Grief is absolutely not a competition. It's gut wrenching he lost an infant, its also gut wrenching you lost your boyfriend suddenly - especially during your formative years.\n\n\nI know reddit as a whole can be dramatic but your BIL is toxic and immature. His comments almost make it sound like he uses his dead child as a way to get attention which is creepy and a horrible way to honor a life lost. I'd really love to know how he would act around someone else that's lost a child. Would be try and one up them too?\n\nIt's okay to keep your distance OP. Be kind when you have to spend time but I wouldn't spend any additional time with this person. He will not help you heal.", "NTA for skipping.

I\u2019m sure that your sister would hope your BIL would stop this morbid tradition.", "NTA.\n\nSeems like John is using his grief as an excuse to be a total dick. Some people are like that. I'm so sorry for your loss.  Losing any loved one is incredibly painful.", "NTA - I mean, I know I wouldn't go.", "NTA. I am 61 years old.  I have had to bury both my parents, my husband, my best friend and several friends and family members.  I can tell you for a fact, that competitive behavior is not normal. It isn't healthy, and your family is enabling it.", "NTA. I also lost a baby at two and a half months. It was agonizing in a way I can\u2019t even put into words. It always will be agonizing. But what your BIL is doing isn\u2019t healthy, and it\u2019s actually inexcusable that your mother and sister are going along with it. \n\nDistance yourself and take care of yourself. What you are going through is also agonizing.", "First of all, I am so sorry you lost your boyfriend as such a young age. I understand you BIL is still hurting because of the loss of his child but that does not give him the right to undermine your pain! Grief should never be a competition, it\u2019s always hard to lose someone who you care about no matter who the person is. He is the AH for saying your loss wasn\u2019t as bad. Just because he lost a child, which I am truly sorry he did, does not give him the right to say his loss is worse than yours.\n\nI just want to know how close are you with your sister? Because if you are close and if you chose to not go that could potentially really hurt your relationship with your sister.

I can\u2019t even pretend to know what it\u2019s like to lose a child.  However I still wouldn\u2019t attend his party.\n\nThis is going to come off as rude and a bit much but this really gets under my skin. I loathe when people compare pain. Especially loss. The baby was technically not around for even a year. He should have stopped throwing himself his literal annual pity party when ex moved away. It\u2019s okay to grieve, but to compare it?! I\u2019m assuming your bf was also 16? A 16 year old 4 years ago versus a 2mo 13 years ago. \n\nIf he\u2019s so he\u2019ll bent on comparing pain, which should never happen, and you are being guilted into going, which don\u2019t if you wanna, then remind him how long ago versus you and how much more of an impact your boyfriend had on the world and how many lives he touched and moved. How about you invite your bf\u2019s parents so they can hear what your BIL has to say about your pain versus his.", "NTA for not wanting to go. You are not obligated. \n\nI am sorry for your loss and hope you find peace and happiness in your life. \n\nThere was no need to continue the grief competition by spelling it all out to your mum and sister though. You could've just quietly rsvped as not going and left them all to their memorial anniversary.", "NTA his grieving isn\u2019t healthy and you are in no way obligated to go to some silly function for someone you don\u2019t care for", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ve lost a child. He was 7months. It\u2019s fucking heartbreaking, but there is a trend among some loss parents that their grief is the only grief in the world that matters. It\u2019s frustrating and makes loss parents look shitty. \nHis grief theatrics are just that- theatrics. He is allowed to grieve but attempting to put your family vs you in a grief competition is disgusting and just shows it\u2019s an attention grab.", "Nta. I have lost a baby, to miscarriage.  I have also lost a 14 year old niece. I didn't know anything about the baby. I knew everything about my neice. We lived across the road from each other and were very close. The pain of losing my neice was/is far greater, because I had memories of her, was used to her presence, her laugh, her likes and dislikes. and I missed her so much, still do, 10 years later. I never missed the baby as I never knew it.", "NTA\n\nWhile having an annual party where people who don\u2019t know the dead person it isn\u2019t how I choose to grieve everyone grieves differently.

He kept sobbing and saying no parent should ever bury their son. He did this every day until he died.\n\nI don't think your BIL is trying to turn this into a grief competition. Grandpa was able to watch his son grow up, have a life, have a family. Your BIL did not even have that opportunity when he buried his child. \n\nYou do not need to attend this birthday party.

His grief will still be there as well as yours whether you go or not. You being there won\u2019t fix anything for him but does risk damaging your mental health.", "NTA. I cannot imagine going to a 'party' to memorialize a child I never knew, year after year. I am guessing he has not done any therapy for his grief?", "NTA losing anyone you love is devastating and you can\u2019t compare the grief. He\u2019s doing this for attention and your mom and sister are pandering to him.

Don\u2019t give me wrong, but that doesn\u2019t give John the right to see years is any less traumatic or painful than his. \n\nYou should tell John \u201c look respectfully. I don\u2019t want to hear your opinion about my grief, ever. so please keep it to yourself. \u201c", "Nope, NTA. Mom and sis are enabling this stuff.

The most any do publicly is an annual Facebook post or something.\n\nYou could go the \u201cburn it down route.\u201d  Find stories of people who had it worse and belittle his grief.\n\n\u201cI have a friend who lost a three year old.  Now THAT is hard.  You\u2019re lucky that you didn\u2019t really have time to bond with your baby like she did.\u201d  Or \u201cdid you hear about that woman who lost twins??

NTA", "Do you have any experience with losing a child?  Because this is really callous.", ">For 13 years he's been throwing this \"event\" on the baby's birthday. Why?\n\nI honestly don't know. The lunch with his ex seemed innocent and bittersweet and then she moved away which is when he started doing the parties. At first I thought it was because he needed support (30 years on and my mum still gets depressed about her dad's death on Christmas- grief has no timeline and I'm not judging him or anyone for that) but it did seem a little odd to me. \n\nBut I never said anything because I wouldn't want someone to make comments about my little rituals to my boyfriend, you know?", "Having a few friends who have lost children at all different ages, my experience is that the grief over losing a child never goes away.  And the younger the child was when they passed, the more fear there seems to be for their parents that everyone else will just forget their child even existed, even though that child is still a very real part of them.\n\nWithout any commentary on OP\u2019s grief, because that is also very real and legitimate and there is no need for competition, losing a child really is a different kind of grief.  God willing I will never experience it myself, but having lost people very dear to me and being close to people who have lost children, I can appreciate that it\u2019s just different.", "This would hold more water if he hadn't marked the occasion previously with his ex.\n\nHaving a gathering isn't unusual, it can be a source of support and comfort that his child is remembered in some way by others.\n\nHe's using s***ty language, however.", "Right, probably why the ex moved country's. He wouldn't let her move on. I would be hesitant to have kids with him.", "13 years of being ridiculous and attention seeking.

Sounds terrible but it is \n\nI understand mourning  but making it this annual event seems gross. You can memorialize and mourn the loss of your child alone.

It doesn\u2019t diminish his grief either, the mourning of the loss of an entire life unlived. My SiL lost her daughter at four months old, and four years on, she still has a difficult time looking at her pictures. She mourns not just the time she carried and birthed the child, mothered her for months, but also for the entire life that she had hoped her child would live. \n\nGrief is not a competition.", "> \u201cwell the baby was only two months old how much well could you have known the baby? It doesn\u2019t really have a personality af that time where as your boyfriend was a whole person you knew (for a lot long I\u2019m assuming).\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t advise the OP to say this just because I think the family will see her as a bad person for saying things like that. As she already said in her post the sister and the mom are already upset that she isn\u2019t going and are thinking she is making a big deal out of nothing. So, imagine how everyone will react if OP says this.", "Only a raging asshole would do that.  Dear god.", ">But since this event isn\u2019t about your boyfriend,\n\nBut that's the thing.

Milking the situation so people feel bad for him.\n\nI've lost a pregnancy, it hurts. It really does but I would never turn it into an anniversary where I go to eat out with my ex and bring a poor family into it too. Its horrible, don't go, if he doesn't care about your loss and feelings you don't need to do the same.\n\nNTA and I'm sorry this is your family.", "NTA. Yeah no. If it was just your sister, okay fine.\n\nHe likes the attention he's getting and that's why he ALSO made it into a competition with you -- can't have you stealing his audience or limelight, after all.\n\nSo he is trying to gaslight you and your family into thinking that you losing your BF is somehow less than and not as valid as HIS grief. And it worked on your family.\n\nYes, losing a child is horrible. And as far as relations go, objectively, it sounds worse to lose a child versus a boyfriend. \n\n*But they're a different type of grief*, and comparing them does nothing for anyone -- except him, because he doesn't want to move on and live with the memories that he has. You are trying to do so.\n\nIn the end, you both lost someone. Your grief as well as his, is valid.", "Yup, it\u2019s gross.", "Are you the BIL", "Found the BIL", "Look I know that losing a child is hard, but what you said is actually disgusting, op mourning the loss of her boyfriend is normal and the fact you feel the need to shut her down is gross.\n\n(I just assumed you were the BIL because this is exactly what he was doing)", "Its not a mourning competition, stop it.", "I agree. A have a friend who lost her daughter 20 years ago. She still celebrates her daughter\u2019s birthday with family and friends. \n\nBIL is wrong to compare grief in a demeaning way, but wanting to keep his child\u2019s memory alive and honor that she was on this earth and meaningful is not something that should be mocked.", "It sounds like he\u2019s stuck in the grieving cycle and hasn\u2019t been able to find a way to \u201cmove on\u201d (I don\u2019t mean it in a cold way, more in a reaching the \u201cacceptance\u201d phase type of way). Do you know if he\u2019s gone to therapy at all regarding his baby\u2019s passing? \n\nGrief makes people do really weird things, and the \u201cgrief competition\u201d may just be part of him still grieving (maybe \u201canger\u201d stage?). I\u2019m not saying what he\u2019s doing is right, but I wouldn\u2019t take it personally because he may not be in a sound mental state.\n\nWith that being said, NTA; no one should be subjected to be an emotional punching bag, and if you don\u2019t want to go to this party, you shouldn\u2019t have to.

Good luck.", "You are very kind and non judgmental.\nYou are definitely NTA.\nYour brother in law is not as understanding as you are and you don\u2019t want to fight with him.\nTake care of yourself and your feelings", "You\u2019re NTA, but rather than making it a discussion of him when it comes up, I think it\u2019s worth you thinking about how you explain it to your relatives.\n\n\u201cI love him, and I want him to have the support he needs to heal. However, he is currently at a stage or healing where whenever the topic of grief or loss comes up with me around, he feels compelled to put down a traumatic loss I experienced. That\u2019s been distressing for me - I was a grieving child when he started doing this, and I am only now old enough to recognise that it was never healthy or okay for him to get into a one-upmanship contest with a child about who is more sad. I feel very bad for him that he isn\u2019t yet able to get a grip on those feelings, but until he does, I think it\u2019s best that I gently keep my distance when the topic of grief and loss comes up. When we\u2019ve had a couple of years of interacting as family on neutral occasions without him putting down me or my boyfriend\u2019s memory, then I\u2019ll be cautiously open to rebuilding to where we were. I need you not to try and force this until there has been time for him to move on emotionally from this issue he\u2019s having, because pushing us together before then will turn this into me wanting even more distance from him.\u201d\n\nAnd then just be boring to interact with about it. Say the same thing every time it comes up: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to support him. He isn\u2019t able to interact with me on this topic without some weird behaviours, so I won\u2019t be attending.\u201d If they get too pushy, try \u201cyou talking to me about this cannot improve my relationship with him, but it can damage my relationship with you. Change the subject, please.\u201d And then *flat ignore* anything else they say about it. Hang up the phone, mute the group chat, leave the room. It\u2019s not a discussion.", "I'll agree that losing a child is different, I know several people who have lost children and watching their grief has been hard. I'm just really bothered by how he diminishes OP's grief because it wasn't her child. We are all going to grieve in our own way. BIL's way just doesn't seem to be healthy, he seems really stuck! I hope they can find a way past this because it doesn't sound like anyone is doing anything maliciously here.", "Your response is kind and caring, and yes losing a child grief is a different grief. But I think you got it on the head, his is more a a fear of people forgetting his child. His grief is taking a preformative base and he is making it into a competition. In the loss community, you see parents stuck in the same stage for ages out of fear.", "It is different and John wouldn\u2019t be TA for his grief and the event alone. Losing a child is heart wrenching and a major loss, there is no denying that. It goes against the natural order. \n\nHe crosses into TA territory when he told op (who is NTA) that she \u201cjust lost a person\u201d who she is \u201cnot connected to\u201d. \n\nThat is where the competition comes in. Diminishing her loss for the sake of his own.", "Then I would probably attend for your sister\u2019s sake and for your own. Because if you chose not to attend then maybe your BIL will say even more hurtful things in the future. I don\u2019t want him to paint you as the bad guy here. I understand if you chose not to go but think of how your family would act in the future if you chose not to attend. \r  \nBut sometimes you need to make a decision that is right for you no matter what others might say. Do what\u2019s right for your mental health :).", "Like I said I don\u2019t think using someone\u2019s pain against them is a good thing, but BIL doesn\u2019t seem to understand that his grief is not more important or worse than anyone else\u2019s. Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.", "It's also minimising and just a plain mean thing to say. Him saying dickish things doesn't justify you doing the same, and it's highly unlikely that hitting him where it hurts will make him suddenly see the light.\n\nI recently listened to an interview with someone who'd lost their child about 10-15 years ago. Even after all that time, they still sounded so raw. While they seemed to be doing well enough in life, I got the impression the grief for their child was still very, very present.", "Yeah... NTA. Don't go. If you do get pressured into it, make it clear that bringing up your late boyfriend is a firm boundary and silently get up and leave the second he brings it up. He doesn't get to require your presence just to shit on your grief", "I know where you are coming from and in most instances I would agree. But in this one I disagree because I am almost certain the family would see the OP as a bad person and I Truly don\u2019t want that.", "I would usually agree with the last line but I think it's best left well alone when it involves the death of someone's child"]}
