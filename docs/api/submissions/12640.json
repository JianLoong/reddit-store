At her school, they were putting on a play and she was one of the lead parts.\n\n Problem coming up to it, she had issues with her throat and had to see a specialist, who recommended she rests and minimizes using her voice. I pleaded with her to not to do this role but she insisted and insisted on it despite them having a substitute. Come the night of the play and I was extremely disappointed in her performance. I have a little notebook were I write down my opinions on her various performances, were she can improve etc.\n\nFor this one, I was extremely jaded and disappointed especially with how much I pleaded with her not to perform and this is what I wrote - \"Congratulations for singing even with a vocal problem, very professional. Dancing was even worse than usual, bumped the blonde girl during opening dance. Was awful with what little use she made of the chair during this number. Facial expressions replacing acting are now even worse\"\n\nObviously I don't mean most of that and I kept it private. When she asked for my opinion at home, I said I thought it was good but her voice and dancing in some parts were a bit wonky. She then asked to see what I wrote down about it. I told her I hadn't written anything on it. Had to go to a nightshift afterwards.\n\nCame back and she found the notebook ( I keep in a filing cabinet in my bedroom, had no idea she knew were it was)  and got extremely emotional and angry over my comments. I scolded her for looking at it without my permission, massive fight, next day she went to her mum's and she thinks I was in the wrong for what I wrote, doesn't care that she looked at it without my permission, and she doesn't want to see me for the weekend.", "created_utc": 1679183623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11v5242/aita_for_my_private_criticisms_of_my_daughters/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a BFA in theater performance. I\u2019ve been a professional actor for almost 13 year. I can guarantee you that your daughter is already her own worst critic (or was, until you opened you mouth - sorry, your notebook), and what she needs from HER OWN PARENT isn\u2019t critique or tips or corrections. She needs support. She needs encouragement. She needs to be commended for working hard to earn a lead role, and for honoring her commitment even when she wasn\u2019t well. She needs to know that she had someone in her corner cheering her on. If you can\u2019t be that person for her, the literal least you can do is to keep your shitty opinions to yourself. \n\nI don\u2019t care if you think they\u2019re valid - they aren\u2019t. I don\u2019t care if you revise them - they\u2019re still hurtful.

At her school, they were putting on a play and she was one of the lead parts.\n\n Problem coming up to it, she had issues with her throat and had to see a specialist, who recommended she rests and minimizes using her voice. I pleaded with her to not to do this role but she insisted and insisted on it despite them having a substitute. Come the night of the play and I was extremely disappointed in her performance. I have a little notebook were I write down my opinions on her various performances, were she can improve etc.\n\nFor this one, I was extremely jaded and disappointed especially with how much I pleaded with her not to perform and this is what I wrote - \"Congratulations for singing even with a vocal problem, very professional. Dancing was even worse than usual, bumped the blonde girl during opening dance. Was awful with what little use she made of the chair during this number. Facial expressions replacing acting are now even worse\"\n\nObviously I don't mean most of that and I kept it private. When she asked for my opinion at home, I said I thought it was good but her voice and dancing in some parts were a bit wonky. She then asked to see what I wrote down about it. I told her I hadn't written anything on it. Had to go to a nightshift afterwards.\n\nCame back and she found the notebook ( I keep in a filing cabinet in my bedroom, had no idea she knew were it was)  and got extremely emotional and angry over my comments. I scolded her for looking at it without my permission, massive fight, next day she went to her mum's and she thinks I was in the wrong for what I wrote, doesn't care that she looked at it without my permission, and she doesn't want to see me for the weekend.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
