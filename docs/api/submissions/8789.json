That never goes well. Give her some specific boundaries, and if she doesn't adhere to them, give her some space--but tell her why.", "I wrote this before but I want to reword my response.

Your thoughts and experiences with regards to your parents will never 100% be conveyed in a way to have your sister understand especially when she holds a differing opinion.  \n\nIt's okay to establish contact when you want to and it's okay to tell your sister you'll come around on your own time, but it's not for your sister to dictate when. It's also not right to cut your sister off like that. Ultimatums are never good and I honestly see a lot more harm than good that will come out of you following through on your plan to cut her off.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve made it clear then sometimes an ultimatum is the best way to get your point across.

You don't have to reconnect with them if you wish not to, but I don't see why you would give your sister an ultimatum.

Instead of pressuring me, why don't you pressure them to apologize to me for raising me in a homophobic environment and causing me to live in fear in my own home.

The sister refuses to accept it.\n\nLiving in a household where you constantly hear homophobic opinions despite being homosexual yourself can be very damaging to a person since it can make them feel like they themselves are wrong. It can also make them scared about how their parents reacted. The complete acceptance seems to have blindsided her so she is continuously having doubts about it which sucks.

She should be told to drop it and to give you your space, but not threatened.  IMHO", "A change of heart would require them to acknowledge and repent of their earlier actions, and OP says they have not.\n\nFar more likely is they are just thoroughly unprincipled people, and when a belief becomes mildly inconvenient for them, they drop it and pretend they never felt otherwise.

But I see no support for much of the rest of your response. Based on my reading of the fact pattern, OP came out and went no contact. OP's parents reached out and let OP know that she was loved and accepted. OP never responded. That puts the parents in a really tough spot. Do they keep reaching out, or do they wait to hear back from their child? (There's a (valid) school of thought that you let someone like OP reach back out when they're ready.) \n\nYou're also right that OP doesn't have to forgive her parents, and I made that very clear in the third to last sentence of my original post.

Instead, she\u2019s doubling down. It\u2019s not okay for her to hear, \u201cTwin sister, your actions are actively hurting me,\u201d and decide to keep doing it anyway. Any good intentions vanish at that point, because she knows she is causing you pain and she is still choosing to continue.\n\nAs I said in another comment, this is less of an ultimatum than a boundary. You are 100% NTA for sitting your sister down and saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand what I went through and why this hurts me, you just need to accept that it does and respect what I\u2019m asking you to do. If you can\u2019t do that, then I will choose to distance myself, so that you aren\u2019t given more opportunities to hurt me.\u201d\n\nIn setting this boundary, you are giving her a choice and clearly laying out the consequences. You aren\u2019t saying \u201cit\u2019s them or me\u201d you are literally just asking her to stop pushing for some Hallmark movie reunion. You\u2019re not even asking her to not talk about them. This is not a difficult thing you\u2019re asking, and if your sister acts like it is, you have every right to reevaluate your relationship with her going forward.", "So you came out to them, they said they accept you all via the mail?

You are mad at everyone for the secrets you kept.", "I agree with your second paragraph, but the last part of your last one is such BS. \n\nThis is not your average ultimatum. This is a person who experienced trauma at the hands of her parents. The people who should have provided unconditional love and a safe space instead provided hateful rhetoric and an environment that was actively harmful to OP.\n\nSister might never truly understand, but that\u2019s where the phrase, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand my boundary, you just have to respect it,\u201d comes into play. Sister is not the judge of what is and isn\u2019t acceptable in OP\u2019s relationships with anyone. Sister has no right to insist that OP forgive and/or forget what the parents have done in the past. Sister has ZERO rights here.\n\nIf Sister continues to insist on doing something that actively causes OP pain every time she interacts with her, then issuing an ultimatum is ABSOLUTELY the right thing to do. Because it\u2019s not even an ultimatum, it\u2019s a BOUNDARY. OP would be saying, \u201cYou have a right to your feelings about our parents, but I have the right to not be confronted with my trauma every time I talk to you. Quit bringing them up, or I won\u2019t be able to see you anymore.\u201d And then Sister has a choice and complete free agency to decide what she wants to do. If she chooses to keep bringing up the parents, then OP should not feel any guilt or shame at following through with the boundary that was set.\n\nActing like an ultimatum - one that has the sole purpose of putting a stop to the active harm OP is experiencing - will cause more harm than good is ridiculous. OP should never continue to be around her abuser once she\u2019s been given a choice and has chosen to continue the abuse.", "Your comment doesn\u2019t help here, because your example of a boundary is one OP has already set, and her sister has repeatedly violated. \u201cHey please don\u2019t hurt me\u201d is obviously a great first step before burning down a relationship, but when the other person refuses to listen then it doesn\u2019t do much good. \n\nBoundaries are often misunderstood as a line in the sand that the other person can\u2019t cross\u2026except they usually just step right over it and the boundary-setter is like \u201cWell I tried, nothing more I can do.\u201d When in reality, boundaries are for YOU.

Her sister is being told repeatedly that her actions are harmful, and persisting anyway. The actions of the parents have zero bearing on whether the sister\u2019s actions are okay or not. Sister doesn\u2019t have to believe or agree with OP to not be an AH and bring up topics she\u2019s been asked not to bring up.", "They've said things that are explicitly homophobic ever since I can remember, yes", "Yes, all the time.", "I think your confusing your experience with the experience of thousands of queer people whose parents *on paper* accept them, but harbor anger and resentment. \n\nSaying they\u2019re cool with it now, after a lifetime of\nBeing homophobic doesn\u2019t mean OP has to suddenly be like \u201cyay we are a happy family\u201d they\u2019ve already done the damage.", "If you have spent all your life hearing people say horrible things about people like you and say that people like you deserve horrible things to happen to them, then I suspect that that gets really engrained in your belief system and that does make you fear for your safety. If you've spent years living like that and know that these are deeply held beliefs of your family, then suspect it takes more than a card to convince you that you are not in danger. There are a lot of stories of conversion camps. \n\nOP is open to a relationship with her sister. She is not willing for a relationship with her parents. That's her choice. Apart from the card, OP doesn't say that her parents are actually trying to reconnect with her,just that her sister thinks she should. Her sister is doing all the legwork and may not actually be representing her parents' thoughts."]}
