They invited our family over for dinner and to show us which went horribly. It\u2019s a nice townhome and when she showed us to the master we found that there were two queen beds. I made a remark asking if there was already trouble in paradise and my sister said that one bed isn\u2019t enough space, that they both get hot, and since they both have sensory issues, they just find it easier to sleep in separate beds. I quipped how their sex life must be awful and my BIL made a remark back how they have a very healthy sex life but it wasn\u2019t my business. It\u2019s natural for us to tease in our family and we do it all the time. So when my sister showed us the big walk in closet that they had made into a room for their 10 Guinea pigs instead I made another sexual remark and my BIL snapped, telling me that I needed to stop making inappropriate comments regarding him and my sister because it makes her uncomfortable. I\u2019ve told my BIL in the past to not call me out in front of everyone like that because it makes everyone uncomfortable. At this point I was just trying to lighten the mood and made a snide remark along the lines of \u201cthere\u2019s that douchey frat boy attitude.\u201d (He dresses and has the face of someone who just got off of his Daddy\u2019s yacht so he does look like he would be a total douche) At this point, my sister was upset and just asked us to knock it off so we did. We go along with dinner and I noticed how he hovered over my sister like he was trying to protect her from me, whenever I tried to tease her, he\u2019d cut me off and change the subject, even my parents would put me down for this. I\u2019m not trying to sound bad here, but ever since my sister was diagnosed with autism and started dating my BIL that\u2019s only when I started noticing her displaying symptoms. Thats also when we stopped teasing her and walking on eggshell around her. It\u2019s annoying and feels like he completely messed up my family dynamic.\n\nAfter dinner, we were supposed to get ice cream but my BIL pulled me aside and asked me to leave. I was extremely upset by this and told him that my sister only acts like this because she married him and I told him that he is controlling and rude. Later my sister called me and told me that she would like to spend some time away from me and will see if my attitude improvs at Christmas.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m absolved of any guilt here, but I had asked him not to call me out in front of everyone in the past because it\u2019s humiliating and he blatantly overlooked that and that\u2019s what upset me. I was just trying to have a normal night with my sister and he kept butting in and ruining it.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1689787704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1541c52/aita_for_teasing_my_sister_in_a_way_thats_typical/", "score": 722, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said yourself your sister was \u201cgood at masking,\u201d so I\u2019m not sure why you think it\u2019s weird/interesting that once she was diagnosed and met someone who made her feel safe, she all of a sudden felt more comfortable being herself. \n\n2. Stop making jokes about your sister\u2019s sex life. It\u2019s weird as hell. It doesn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s \u201ctypical for your family.\u201d Your family\u2019s way of teasing is mean and harmful and you should feel bad. \n\n3.

Why is that only a bad thing when it\u2019s happening to you? And that\u2019s before we even get into the larger point, which is: *You absolutely should be made to feel uncomfortable when you\u2019re trying to publicly humiliate someone*.\n\n5. If you wanted to \u201clighten the mood,\u201d why did you immediately make \u201ca snide remark\u201d? Are you this deeply unpleasant, or are you doing a bit? \n\n6. According to you, no longer ridiculing your sister messed up your family dynamic. Good. That\u2019s an awful family dynamic. Your BIL is right to ruin it. \n\nYou seem to lack some self-awareness, so in case it wasn\u2019t sparklingly clear: YTA.", "YTA.

Zero margin of error here, zero shared blame, zero mitigating circumstances. 100% thoroughbred AH.\n\nYou write \"I\u2019ve told my BIL in the past to not call me out in front of everyone like that because it makes everyone uncomfortable\". That's on you. If you don't want to be called out and have everybody made uncomfortable, stop making comments that demand to be called out. Simple.\n\nBut really, what you are saying here is \"I want to continue being the AH I have been all my life and not have any consequences for it.\" The whole BS about \"calling out\" is just blame-shifting. \n\n\"I noticed how he hovered over my sister like he was trying to protect her from me\": he was. Ask yourself why that's necessary.\n\n\"told him that my sister only acts like this because she married him\": very possibly true, she has finally found someone she doesn't have to mask in front of without enduring persistent rudeness. That must be a huge relief to her. \n\n\"I was just trying to have a normal night with my sister\": your definition of a normal night is to ridicule and humiliate your sister, even after you have been asked not to. You need to find a New Normal.", "You're a massive AH.  You don't go to someone's house, make rude, crude and inappropriate comments then whine because you get called out.

Don't act like an AH.  You brought that on yourself.  Frankly, I would have asked you to leave after the remark about the guinea pigs.  You were given ample opportunity to act like decent human being and courteous guest.  You chose not to.", "YTA . You continued to make off remarks about their bedroom set up and intimate life. Despite being asked not to. If you don't want to be called out for your bad behaviour, perhaps don't behave badly.\n\nIt sounds like your sister's diagnosis has freed her. That perhaps she is finally feeling as though she can truly discover who she is without social norms suffocating her.\n\nFrom what you've described, the way you talk to your sister has probably always been an issue. You may well have thought you were just being silly when in fact you've been causing her all sorts of mental and physical pain.\n\nIt may have been one thing before her diagnosis. You were literally ignorant.\n\nBut now it seems you're just being purposefully ignorant and ableist. Perhaps listen and pay attention to the things people say and how they're acting around you.", "You repeatedly made sexual jokes, about your sister, and YOU\u2019RE whining about being embarrassed?! Of course YTA. Grow up.", "YTA Your sister has always hated your family's shitty \"teasing\" and now has someone to intervene on her behalf. \nThe most amusing thing here is you thinking *her husband* was \"interfering with your normal evening\".", "If you don't want him to call you out in front of people,  stop doing shit in front of people that gets you called out.\n\nHe told you to stop making sexual comments about his marriage.  You didn't.  Why should he offer you better treatment than you offer him?\n\nYTA.  Full bore", "\"The dinner party went horribly because I am bitter that I can't be an ableist bully towards my sister because my brother in law is getting in the way of my fun.\" This is basically what you are saying in your post. Of course YTA, and one of the worst I've seen on here in a while", "YTA. You sexually harassed your own sister and her husband and then called her husband a douche for rightfully getting upset about it. You then continued to try to bully your sister and resented her husband for protecting her from you.\n\nThis has nothing to do with their autism and everything to do with your apparent need to sexually harass and bully your own family.", "YTA\n\nI find it extremely weird you joke about your sister's sex life... twice, after you've been asked to stop.\n\nBut your \"humor\" aside, have you ever thought that maybe she trusts her husband more than you? That she feels she can be herself with him, talk about jokes that make her uncomfortable? And this means he'll try to protect her?", "YTA.  How do you think this was funny whether they are autistic or not?", "YTA. You're pissy that he \"called you out\" in front of everyone when YOU are the one making inappropriate comments over and over again? Really?", "I want to clarify that there is no such thing as \"mildly\" autistic, we prefer to refer to autism as a spectrum and to say that someone is very or mildly autistic is somewhat ableist. The fact that your sister demonstrates more autistic traits since being with her husband and having her diagnosis may mean that she is trying to be herself and not mask (which is exhausting).\n\nClearly your jokes make your sister and her husband uncomfortable and they have let you know this on several occasions but you have not respected that boundary. And it seems right to me that since you have overstepped those boundaries and not respected their requests in THEIR own home, they politely asked you to leave. You don't seem to have noticed but your BIL was kind enough to pull you aside to ask you privately to leave, so I think that was quite considerate of him.\n\nJustifying a bad action just because it is \"typical\" in your family does not make what you do any less harmful. You seem to be the only one who doesn't realize the impact your words can have and maybe this situation can teach you that.\n\nYTA", "YTA, and not just for the incident.  You are a AH to the core, a nasty person with no boundaries.", "YTA. You weren't trying to have a normal night with your sister. You were bullying her and her husband, repeatedly, with sexually inappropriate comments and insults.\n\nAnd you shouldn't feel humiliated about your BIL pointing that out. If you feel humiliated, you should feel humiliated about the fact that people witnessed you acting this badly. Nobody decent would need your sister to tell them what you were doing is unacceptable.", "YTA You act like a boorish oaf with no manners while you're a guest in someone else's home and can't seem to grasp you were the problem. I think it's time for a little self reflection unless you want to find yourself isolated from your family and friends because you do not know how to behave and what is and is not appropriate in social settings.\n\nAnd whining about people telling you to knock it off because you find it humiliating is laughable.", "Wow, so you're bold enough to repeatedly make cruel humiliating comments about someone in their own home but you expect them to pander to your fragile ego by just putting up with it because 'please don't do that' is too upsetting for you to hear? Here's a tip: don't be so rude and bullying, then no one will be calling you out for anything.\n\nIt's really telling that for you, a normal night with your sister is you repeatedly insulting and humiliating her and you're mad that you're not longer allowed to do so because she's found someone who actually loves her and wants to treat her well.\n\nYTA", "YTA. So you\u2019ve been verbally and emotionally abusing your sister for years, and once she met someone who loves her you started verbally and emotionally abusing him too, while also trying to bully him into enabling you to continue your abuse of your sister.\n\nAnd then you try to play the victim after being called out on your behaviour?\n\nFor your sister and her husbands sake I really hope they cut all contact with you and the rest of your dysfunctional family.", "So, let\u2019s make sure we all understand.\n\nYou made fun of your autistic sister and her autistic husband, made numerous \u201cjokes\u201d about their sex life, even after you were told that said sex life was fine and, even more importantly, none of your business, but you, somehow, were shocked and insulted that your BIL called you out for it and then asked you to leave\u2026and you\u2019re unsure as to whether or not you\u2019re the AH?\n\nRemember, in order for something to be a joke, it has to be funny\u2026especially to the individuals who are the butt of the jokes. If you persist in making the same jokes after the target has informed you that they are uncomfortable with it, you\u2019re just a bully.\n\nYTA in as many ways as could be possible in this situation.\n\nAccept your timeout and hope that you can find your way back into your sister and BIL\u2019s good graces.", "YTA.  I don't care if your actions were normal for *you*, they were incredibly rude to your hosts and to their other guests.", "yes, yta for making inappropriate sexual jokes about your autistic sister and making her uncomfy.  i don\u2019t care if it\u2019s normal for your family, it\u2019s not a good normal.", "Wow...YTA.   I get teasing as I grew up with a lot of smartasses, but it sounds like you were pretty incessant about it and tried to show your BIL that he couldn't control your content.  Yes, he can!   He has a wife he needs to protect from your bullying, which apparently you find funny, but no one else does so knock of the attention seeking.  A joke here and there is fine...a light tease here and there is fine...it should have stopped with \"trouble in paradise.\"  They're uncomfortable...so stop.", "YTA. Humiliating to be called out for being a big bully but you don\u2019t think you\u2019re humiliating your sister? He didn\u2019t ruin family dynamics. He\u2019s just not letting you bully your sister anymore and you\u2019re pissed about it.", "Wow, SUCH YTA. \n\nWho cares if your family teases? YOUR SISTER DOESN'T LIKE IT. \n\nAnd what sort of sibling keeps asking about their sister's sex life? THAT'S GROSS AND INVAVSIVE.\n\nAnd just to show what an incredible bully you are, you expect her to take it and not have any boundaries because YOUR FEELINGS ARE MOST IMPORTANT. \n\nDon't be surprised if she goes NC with you. You have no boundaries, no respect, and don't value privacy.", "YTA\n\nHe called you out to make you aware that you're an AH. Clearly you think it's ok to disrespect someone in their own home, and that's not cool. \n\nJust because your banter was tolerated in the past doesn't mean it always will be. Sounds like your sister and her husband have made a nice life for themselves that works for them. Him protecting her is normal, she's his wife. If it were his family treating him in a way he didn't like,  his wife would probably be doing the same thing for him.", "YTA. You were asked more than once to knock it off and you were the only one there that didn\u2019t see a problem with it. \n\nYour BIL wouldn\u2019t have to call you out in front of others if you stopped behaving badly in front of others. You were asked politely and ignored it. That teasing sounds like bullying to me, as teasing is only funny when everyone laughs. \n\nGood on your BIL for defending his wife and good on your sister for clearly communicating her boundaries to you. It\u2019s up to you to listen to her and genuinely knock it off for real.", " you're a despicable person and I'm glad your sister is married to someone so kind.

It's you.", "YTA. why insist on teasing her so much? That seems frankly very odd and overbearing, in a way that is likely harmful, hurtful, and awkward. Do you have no other ways to interact with her? Have you been assessed for a developmental disability yourself? You seem to have a childish and masochistic love of an unhealthy dynamic and you need to take a step back and look at the big picture. \n\nMaybe your sister spent years constantly trying to suppress her symptoms because she was always the butt of your jokes, and BIL makes her feel accepted.

They invited our family over for dinner and to show us which went horribly. It\u2019s a nice townhome and when she showed us to the master we found that there were two queen beds. I made a remark asking if there was already trouble in paradise and my sister said that one bed isn\u2019t enough space, that they both get hot, and since they both have sensory issues, they just find it easier to sleep in separate beds. I quipped how their sex life must be awful and my BIL made a remark back how they have a very healthy sex life but it wasn\u2019t my business. It\u2019s natural for us to tease in our family and we do it all the time. So when my sister showed us the big walk in closet that they had made into a room for their 10 Guinea pigs instead I made another sexual remark and my BIL snapped, telling me that I needed to stop making inappropriate comments regarding him and my sister because it makes her uncomfortable. I\u2019ve told my BIL in the past to not call me out in front of everyone like that because it makes everyone uncomfortable. At this point I was just trying to lighten the mood and made a snide remark along the lines of \u201cthere\u2019s that douchey frat boy attitude.\u201d (He dresses and has the face of someone who just got off of his Daddy\u2019s yacht so he does look like he would be a total douche) At this point, my sister was upset and just asked us to knock it off so we did. We go along with dinner and I noticed how he hovered over my sister like he was trying to protect her from me, whenever I tried to tease her, he\u2019d cut me off and change the subject, even my parents would put me down for this. I\u2019m not trying to sound bad here, but ever since my sister was diagnosed with autism and started dating my BIL that\u2019s only when I started noticing her displaying symptoms. Thats also when we stopped teasing her and walking on eggshell around her. It\u2019s annoying and feels like he completely messed up my family dynamic.\n\nAfter dinner, we were supposed to get ice cream but my BIL pulled me aside and asked me to leave. I was extremely upset by this and told him that my sister only acts like this because she married him and I told him that he is controlling and rude. Later my sister called me and told me that she would like to spend some time away from me and will see if my attitude improvs at Christmas.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m absolved of any guilt here, but I had asked him not to call me out in front of everyone in the past because it\u2019s humiliating and he blatantly overlooked that and that\u2019s what upset me. I was just trying to have a normal night with my sister and he kept butting in and ruining it.\n\nAITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I too am autistic; the only difference is that I was diagnosed as a toddler and my family still would pull the same BS you and your family do. The only reason I was able to set boundaries with them is because of my husband. He\u2019s not autistic but he also has ADHD (I have both autism and ADHD, the ADHD I only got diagnosed with a few years ago). He also has a similar personality to your BIL. He has had to call out my family a few times on my behalf with my permission before they got the hint because they wouldn\u2019t listen to me. \n\nYour BIL is not the enemy. He is protecting your sister from you and your family\u2019s toxic BS. It\u2019s because of my husband that I got the backbone and confidence to live my neurodivergent life the way i need to live. Sounds like your sister is in that process too. \n\nMy advice? Do not aggravate your sister like that ever again or you will get called out again like that. If you want to be respected like that, respect your sister and your BILs way of life. If you can\u2019t do this, fuck off and leave them alone. You and your family fundamentally do not respect your sister and your BIL because you\u2019re making fun of their way of life. This shows me you and your family do not respect autistic or any kind of neurodivergent ways of life. It\u2019s no wonder so many NDs have so much hate towards neurotypicals. \n\nDo you want to support your sister and BILs way of life?

She has never felt safe until she met her husband, and now has someone who she can be herself around without being made to feel like an outcast. Someone who will protect her against a family that never made her feel accepted. Good for husband for calling you out.

That doesn't sound at all fun or normal to me. \n\nAnd even after being called out, you STILL kept making jokes and poking at her. If you want things to be \"normal\" how about just...not making fun of her? Are you incapable of interacting with her and your family without teasing her?\n\nWhat you are noticing isn't that she suddenly has visible autism symptoms, it is that her husband makes her comfortable enough to be open and he is defending her from your rude remarks. \n\nYou also admit you \"take it too far sometimes\" and yet you think what? You shouldn't suffer any discomfort when you make other people uncomfortable? BIL checked you when you took it too far, and you kept on picking and are still here upset that there were any consequences for you not reading the room, not stopping when directly asked, and finally being asked to leave because you were ruining everyone's night. \n\nAnd let me be clear- making fun of the sex life of people is not humor \"typical\" in most family's, or even friend groups. Sure, I might make a very stereotypical joke with my friends about sex, but when presented with a specific situation- like separate beds- I would not take the opportunity to make a joke.  Making fun of someone's looks, especially when you know they are already annoyed at you, isn't typical. Sure, I might make fun of a friend's funny hat, but if they had just told me to knock it off about something, I wouldn't take that time to continue to make fun of them, especially about their appearance. \n\nYour entire family is telling you to stop, that they don't like your jokes, and yet, here you are, wondering why your \"typical\" humor is suddenly not working anymore and how anyone could be upset when repeatedly, everyone told you to knock it off.", "YTA: You've asked him not to call you out on your ah behavior because it makes you feel bad.

Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA and you need to do some hard learning about autism and masking. Masking is exhausting, it can be traumatic, it can put so much strain on your mind and body. I masked for so much of my life and it could be physically painful. My mental health was horrible. I was actively suicidal. It wasn\u2019t until I felt safe and comfortable to stop trying to appear neurotypical that I started to improve, that I became comfortable voicing when something upset me rather than try to force myself to be okay with things that were just not good for my needs. I require much more support than what people who do not live with me might actually realize, and that includes my parents/sibling. My spouse is also autistic and being with them makes life feel so much better and easier. They understand my needs because they have similar needs.

You should respect the boundaries of your sister and her husband. I understand there were no bad intentions. But it is time to realize boundaries.", "Yta", "YTA - Omg I didn\u2019t even finish reading. Why are you so rude? Who hurt you?!", "It\u2019s giving \u201cit was a joke\u201d after telling you the most offensive thing you\u2019ve ever heard in your life", "She isn\u2019t self diagnosed, that by the way is valid when it is after long research.\n\nYou are highly uneducated on why people leaned on a diagnosis. Going undiagnosed for that long can bring to burn out, and many other problems that NT do not see. A diagnosis allow the person to understand themselves and avoid to end burn out every single day just to make people like you happy.", "Oh god. As someone who has only recently started exploring that some of the things I\u2019ve felt crazy for for the past 20 years of my life might have a medical reason, god. That\u2019s completely it. The sister doesn\u2019t feel like she has to fit in or try to cover herself up anymore because she found someone she can unmask with and she knows that it\u2019s not her fault and that there\u2019s nothing she can do to fit in better, and now her sister wants her to go back in the box and mask for her own comfort. God. You nailed it. Yeah. YTA. Majorly", "The type of category that is allegedly popular in Alabama?", "Yikes. I'll say depending on you and your siblings boundaries sex jokes or grosser jokes could be totally okay, me and my siblings sometimes do it, but NEVER in front of anyone we're not 100% trusting and comfortable with, and especially not when someone tells them to stop, OP kept pushing boundaries but wants to act like they're the victim, what a headache that must be.\n\nAlso edit to add: NEVER in front of any other family, I'm pretty sure we'd all die of embarrassment. I'm so glad my mother never saw me white chick tweaking to WAP.", "To be fair, some families openly joke about sex together and it\u2019s totally fine.", "Just came here to add. \n\n\n\n\nI have Autism, I was diagnosed when I was pretty young. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool was pretty hard to hide my Autism because I wanted to be seen as a normal person. Middle School was no better I got looked at, laughed at, & made fun of. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh School was slightly better but there were people who still make me feel indifferent. After my high school graduation anniversary came up, I decided to call out all of my classmates who used to look at me, laugh at me, said I was weird needed to do some research on Autism itself. OP needs to realize that if her family dynamics is to tease her sister because of her Autism maybe she should do her own research on Autism instead of being ignorant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe should learn to love her sister instead of making her put on a mask to hide her true self. Her BIL is her sister\u2019s biggest supporter & she gets mad at him calling her teasing behavior out. She shouldn\u2019t dish out what she can\u2019t take. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope this wakes up OP\u2019s eyes.", "I am sorry that happens to you. If you can comfortably do so I would tell your family you are on the autism spectrum and do not appreciate the jokes. If they still make them I would go no contact with them.\n\nMost people I know on the spectrum are super kind and bright.\n\nBelieve in yourself and your worth and know that people who do not treat you right are the problem.", "yeah, it is interesting that she feels she has to mention her autism ALL THE FUCKING TIME, like, does she not have other characteristics to herself, and their reason for having seperate beds does not even matter. I sleep horribly when sharing a bed - without having a formal diagnosis (yet, ha?)", "Playing that angle just makes it worse too. If you have to \"fake\" an autism diagnosis to stop the incessant teasing, it's not teasing, it's bullying, and it's pretty horrible bullying too. While I don't think the sister is faking the diagnosis, and it's not really relevant to whether or not OP is the AH. Unwrapping that just makes OP an even bigger AH.", "Thanks! I corrected it.", "No way hes gonna reply, oblivious bullies like that find all kinds of reasons not to self evaluate. He came here for reassurance, not evaluation.", "Bro also wants him out of her out and accuses him of being controlling and stuff after calling out that douchey remarks. \n\nThis isn't just your regular AH brother. \n\nThis is an average redditor to his fullest cringe level because the lack of self awareness is insane!", "Whenever I hear someone describe a person's autism as \"mild\" I just think, \"it's mild *to you*. For us it's all day everyday, you only think it's mild because we mask it *for your comfort*\"", "Holy shit you just described my family dynamic better than I ever have", "Can I also add how shitty OP is for trying to paint the BIL as the stereotypical controlling man for trying to protect his SO's feelings? \n\nPeople like OP are the reason why terms like controlling went from something serious to a joke term hurled at people purely to make them look bad.", "You're the third commenter I've seen skip the fact that OP is a woman. What gives?", "I'm undiagnosed but very obviously on the spectrum and growing up my mom's side of the family was the exact same way. I was always too sensitive or a Debbie downer. They were always just joking to veil their cruelty. I'm 33 now and I haven't spoken to them in almost 10 years. The only regret that I have is that I didn't do it sooner.", "I think you've made a good observation. Sounds like jealousy is eating op up", "Ugh. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s exhausting growing up that way, isn\u2019t it?", "Because I (m58) \ud83d\ude00 never pay any attention to the () and reading the post it sounded like a brother bullying a sister.   \n\nWe are mostly so misogynist that we don\u2019t ever think of a woman being that kind of an AH to their sister but we can easily picture a man doing that.", "Understandable. Didn't want to come across as dickish or accusing you but yeah. \n\nIf you edited that bit out and asked me to guess OP's gender I'd probably say man too tbh.", "13 years old boys are actually better then that. Lets stop blaming immature children for toxic behavior of adults.", "lol that\u2019s cause you\u2019re american."]}
