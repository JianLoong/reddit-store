I also have a thing about keeping the thing I got first.", "NTA you're not wrong, it's your dad's problem if he's panicking and can't come up with other ideas \n\nINFO: How does this braincell plushie look like? That sounds so cute lol", "NTA. His lack of planning doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up a gift. What a tasteless request. Can you imagine if the coworker found out they\u2019d been given a gift that had been taken away from its original recipient?!", "NTA.\n\nReally, if you'd been okay with it, it wouldn't have been a completely unreasonable thing to ask.  It essentially amounts to loaning it out for a little while.\n\nBut you weren't okay with it.  If he'd said \"ah, well\" and left it at that, my verdict would have been NAH.  But when he called you an AH when you declined, well, that made *him* an AH.\n\nSo: final verdict is NTA.", "The very same gift? Ew.", "NAH. It's a reasonable request from your Dad and you have every right to say no.
