{"id": 19689, "submission_id": "149avxu", "title": "AITA for not wanting my roommate to wear his outdoor shoes on my furniture?", "selftext": "My roommate wears his outdoor shoes inside the house. We have hardwood floors in the common areas and carpet in our bedrooms. I have always lived in a household where we took off our shoes when we walked in the door. However, the carpets in our bedrooms are filthy, so I was OK with wearing shoes inside the house, even though it still made me feel kind of gross. Our landlord has agreed to professionally clean the carpets, so this is where the AITA conversation begins:\n\n* I asked my roommate if he would agree to no longer wear his outdoor shoes inside the house.\n* He says no - He has to wear shoes all the time per his podiatrist.\n* I say fair enough would he get a separate pair of indoor shoes.\n* He says his outside shoes are clean, and he is not walking in my room where the carpet is anyway\n* I say we literally live in an area where tons of dogs and sadly lots of homeless people poop on the sidewalks, and that if the rest of the apartment floor is dirty that will quickly track into my own room. At this point I offer to just buy him a pair of indoor shoes from Costco.\n* He says no - it will be too inconvenient to switch shoes whenever he needs to run out to his car or to grab a bite to eat.\n* I am frustrated at this point and say okay well if you are insisting on wearing outdoor shoes inside, can you please do a lap with the swiffer at night. I propose this will take maybe a minute since we don't have all that much space and I will buy the Swiffer too.\n* He says no, and contests that it will take up to two minutes. Acknowledges he should clean the floor more often and offers to do it once a week.\n* I am more frustrated and point out that I have offered many compromises, but he is simply unwilling to move from \"I am wearing outdoor shoes inside and will only clean the floors once a week.\"\n* He acknowledges he is potentially being stubborn. Mentions he maybe needs to make an AITA thread. Hence me doing this now.\n* I then say I am planning to buy a large ottoman to replace our coffee table that needs to be replaced, and I don't want him putting his outdoor shoes on it.\n* He says he will be putting his shoes on it.\n* At this point I say let's sleep on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously I am only pointing out my POV as that's all anyone can ever provide. I plan to share this link w my roommate and will add an edit if he thinks his perspective needs to be shared or inaccuracies need to be addressed.\n\nEdit: gotta say some of the comments saying I am an asshole gave me perspective. I don\u2019t necessarily agree but it did open my aperture a bit. Still think shoes in the house is gross but fair points made all around. Roommate agreed to not put shoes on furniture, and one comment pointed out that if I don\u2019t think a minute of swiffer a night is a big deal, I should do it.

Takes seconds to put them on.\n\nAlso, better not to buy the ottoman unless he agrees to wear indoor shoes or covers.", "NTA. I think you\u2019ve offered more than reasonable compromises and even offered to pay for indoor shoes. \n\nSeriously, who puts their shoes on a coffee table? It seems like their response is quite spiteful. \n\nRealistically I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to settle on arrangement you are both happy with. Unless one of you move out or just live with it.", "NTA. your roommate seems unhinged. i am looking forward to his side of the story.", "NTA for not wanting your roommate to damage your shit.

Have to wear insoles + shoes whenever able.\n\nI'm not exactly happy about taking them off/on every time necessary, but, I also recognise boundaries based off of cleanliness/etiquette\n\nYou have been understanding and fair, but not sure about where you should draw the line. \nIt's a very fine line to walk.", "NTA. Absolutely disgusted by him wearing outdoor shoes in the house - at minimum he should be cleaning the floors every day and not putting the shoes on any furniture. For people saying he pays rent and it\u2019s also his place - by that metric he can also spit on the floor and lick the seat cushion and you just gotta accept it.", "NTA \n\nDude needs to get some indoor shoes", "NAH \n\n2 people with 2 different ways of living. \n\nConflict doesn't make you AH.", "NTA. He\u2019s lazy, disgusting and an AH deluxe.

You\u2019re obviously fixating on something that bothers you. A lot of people do it and it\u2019s ok to do that however the problem comes when you\u2019re allowing your fixation to affect other people more than just a conversation.\n\nBringing up how you feel about something is ok but after you get an answer about something, you can\u2019t control anyone else. Instead of worrying your room mate about his habits, just find ways for YOU to do things that make you feel better. If you feel like the floors are dirty, clean them. If there\u2019s an obvious mess, they caused of course call it out but it doesn\u2019t sound like your room mate is doing anything other than letting you control him. \n\nSometimes we get caught up in our own feelings and we forget to take a step back and analyze if what we want is really that deep. Not everyone has the same values.", "Personally, ESH! Asking him to swiffer the floor every night is excessive but you both have different views on this topic.\nI wear my shoes in my home but, if they're muddy or wet or they may be dirty, I take them off and I don't put them on the furniture. Your flatmate thinks there's nothing wrong with wearing shoes in the house but, he does seem to be digging his heels in rather than looking to compromise - shoes on furniture....no!!", "ESH. The indoor shoes vs outdoor shoes thing is cultural. People who never wore outdoor shoes indoors don't get it, but LOTS of people wear outdoor shoes inside: you don't have to like it, but it is normal for many people. However, putting your shoes on the furniture is bad manners. I was going to say YTA until your roommate decided to put his shoes on furniture you bought (although even then it is furniture designed for feet).", "NTA for wanting your inside environment kept clean, but a soft YTA if you expect to dictate your high standards to your roommate.  I'd say since it's important to you only that YOU take that minute or two every night to swiffer your common area.  I mean, is that amount of time for something you only want worth all this angst?  Just do it and you'll both be happy.  As for the ottoman, if it's cloth, forget it.  If it's something you can easily wipe off, that'd work.", "YTA, if you want the floors cleaned ao much do it yourself. Who do you think you are to dictate what someone else can do in their own home.

Sorry you're dealing with this. You offered so many compromises, and he literally doesn't want to do anything about his gross habits. You are absolutely right in your rationale for not wanting outdoor shoes in the house.", "anyone who refuses to take off their shoes and wear the slippers i provide for *everyone* who comes into my house is automatically banned from my house. \n\nif someone put their outside shoes on my brand new table i think that would send me over the edge. nta", "NAH.  You can ask, and he can say no.  They're his feet, not yours.", "Canadian here. The way I GASPED at the nerve of this person to wear shoes in the house. It's not being a \"neat freak\" here, it's the most basic courtesy ever. \n\nThere is so much poo in your house. So. Much.", "Couple years ago, it was recommended I wear shoes inside the house because of my flat feet. I bought a pair of shoes to wear inside the house.  The roommate is definitely being an AH by refusing to wear a pair of house only shoes.", "Yep op is definitely NTA. Gotta have some slippers of some kind for inside. Obviously he's gotta have a doctor recommended insole so it would have to be shoes like boat shoes or hey dudes, something along the lines of easily removable but still able to take supports.\n\nI'll never understand people who wear dirty shoes in the house. Don't people want to be able to sit on the floor or something and not worry about being dirty?", "Yes, exactly! I bought blue surgical shoe covers so repair/maintenance people don\u2019t need to take off their shoes. Definitely NTA to me too.", "Lots of people ( the majority I believe) put their feet on ottomans.\n\nI don't take my shoes off when I enter my own home. My son, in his home, has a no shoes rule. When I go over there, I take off my shoes at the door like everyone else.  The problem is that you're trying to impose your cleanliness standards on a roommate  This should have been discussed before you moved in together. I personally would not accept dictatorial rules from a roommate without some kind of discussion and consensus agreement.", "Appreciate the perspective. Which part potentially makes me an asshole? In the end I was willing to accept outdoor shoes if he cleans more frequently - is this still being an asshole in your mind? Genuinely asking. Don\u2019t have to agree with you but trying to understand.", "The roommate isn\u2019t living in some sort of dictatorship lol, it\u2019s as simple as just taking the shoes off once you get inside the apartment. Personally I don\u2019t understand why anyone would feel comfortable treading dirt and other shit into their house", "I think asking him to swiffer nightly or change his habits of a lifetime is unreasonable in a dispute that is essentially over the difference between what two people think is normal. I assume that if he actually tracked in feces from the street he'd clean it up, right? Unless he's refusing to deal with obvious filth, It's your sense of clean vs his. \n\nYou asked him to change for you, he refused, and you kept on asking him to change for you. That's not a compromise. It doesn't matter how many options you give him or how reasonable they seem to you if what you're asking him to do is change his standards. \n\nFor what it's worth, I try to avoid wearing outdoor shoes inside so I totally get your perspective but I grew up in houses where nobody took their shoes off indoors so I also get that side of things.", "It's as simple as you doing what I think is the only right way, not what you're comfortable with. Sounds like dictatorship to me."]}
