However, the carpets in our bedrooms are filthy, so I was OK with wearing shoes inside the house, even though it still made me feel kind of gross. Our landlord has agreed to professionally clean the carpets, so this is where the AITA conversation begins:\n\n* I asked my roommate if he would agree to no longer wear his outdoor shoes inside the house.\n* He says no - He has to wear shoes all the time per his podiatrist.\n* I say fair enough would he get a separate pair of indoor shoes.\n* He says his outside shoes are clean, and he is not walking in my room where the carpet is anyway\n* I say we literally live in an area where tons of dogs and sadly lots of homeless people poop on the sidewalks, and that if the rest of the apartment floor is dirty that will quickly track into my own room. At this point I offer to just buy him a pair of indoor shoes from Costco.\n* He says no - it will be too inconvenient to switch shoes whenever he needs to run out to his car or to grab a bite to eat.\n* I am frustrated at this point and say okay well if you are insisting on wearing outdoor shoes inside, can you please do a lap with the swiffer at night. I propose this will take maybe a minute since we don't have all that much space and I will buy the Swiffer too.\n* He says no, and contests that it will take up to two minutes. Acknowledges he should clean the floor more often and offers to do it once a week.\n* I am more frustrated and point out that I have offered many compromises, but he is simply unwilling to move from \"I am wearing outdoor shoes inside and will only clean the floors once a week.\"\n* He acknowledges he is potentially being stubborn. Mentions he maybe needs to make an AITA thread. Hence me doing this now.\n* I then say I am planning to buy a large ottoman to replace our coffee table that needs to be replaced, and I don't want him putting his outdoor shoes on it.\n* He says he will be putting his shoes on it.\n* At this point I say let's sleep on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously I am only pointing out my POV as that's all anyone can ever provide.

He is maybe being a little more unflexable that you are.  \n\nWould he be willing to use shoe covers (you may have to provide).

No the bottom of the shoe", "NTA, you offered ample compromise, including buying items to make it easier for your roommate. Also your furniture, your rules.

Nta", "NAH. As someone else pointed out, it really comes down to cultural difference/how you were raised. My family always wore shoes inside the house (or at least didn\u2019t take them off at the door, obviously it\u2019s more comfortable to relax in slippers/socks/bare feet!), so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with shoes on inside. I\u2019m kind of laughing at some of these comments suggesting that wearing shoes inside the house is, like, an affront to god and nature\u2026I just wasn\u2019t raised that way! And so it\u2019s not disrespectful or considered unclean to do it, from my POV. \n\nHowever, I have friends who were raised with different norms and they always take their shoes off when they come over, even though I don\u2019t ask them to. \n\nWhen I go to someone else\u2019s house, I respect whatever their routine is \u2014 more than happy to take my shoes off in someone else\u2019s space. I think the conflict comes down to the fact that your roommate isn\u2019t in someone else\u2019s home, he\u2019s in his own. And because it\u2019s his space too, he doesn\u2019t see a reason to change what he\u2019s always done, even though it\u2019s opposite of what you\u2019ve always done and consider normal/appropriate/respectful. \n\nI think a fair compromise would be: he doesn\u2019t put his shoes on the furniture (now THAT is nasty\u2026), swiffers the floor at least once a week (more often if he tracks anything into the house), and doesn\u2019t go in your room/private space with his outdoor shoes.

I grew up in Australia and England, which are shoes on places according to this. I'm blown away by the level of vitriol and moral judgement for wearing shoes inside the house. To me, having other people's foot grossness on my floors and furniture is worse than their shoes, assuming they're not obviously soiled with dirt, animal poo, etc. Here, if someone has super dirty shoes they'll ask if you prefer them to take them off or they'll change shoes, but generally everyone just continues wearing their shoes the whole time. Obviously if someone has a no shoe home you follow those rules but it's quite uncommon. \n\nIn my own home I change into slippers or no shoes when I get in and take my kid's shoes off too, but it's primarily for comfort, not cleanliness. It's better for our feet to not be in shoes all the time. But this idea that you'll get sick and die from wearing outside shoes inside is wild to me. Maybe we just have bigger fish to fry in terms of health risks (deadly animals, skin cancer, etc), or maybe our dirt is less toxic idk. Now that I think about it, I would never leave my shoes outside (or even in certain places inside tbh) cause spiders would get into them and that can be super dangerous.

I am supposed to wear orthotics all the time too. When working 5 days a week in the office, it was enough for me to forgo shoes in the house when at home. Since I've started working from home part of the week, the extra time out of shoes (away from the orthotics) has caused my feet to start really hurting. They would have hurt a lot worse if I had hardwood floors. Now. Instead of wearing shoes that might have picked up who knows what from outside, I bought a pair of special flip-flops from a company called Oofos that are made for people with feet issues. I wear those around the house. They provide enough support so my feet dont hurt so badly (they always hurt somewhat from being deformed). There are other companies that do the same. They can be expensive, but very worth it. Mine were about $70. My orthotics on the other hand, have to be made by a prosthetics company and cost over $500 per pair. Wearing the flip-flops inside would save wear on the orthotics even though you generally have to get new ones every 4-5 years anyway. What I'm trying to say is that there is a middle ground. He is being overly stubborn for refusing to even think about compromise, but it's not quite so easy as you think to just not wear his outside shoes. Some orthotics can be removed and transferred into other shoes, while some cannot. I don't think you are the AH. He is a bit for his refusal to even look into a compromise (and for declairing he will put his nasty shoes on new furniture), but he has very valid reasons to be concerned. When your feet hurt, generally then your knees and back follow. I hope this provides some prospective.", "I'm fascinated by the divide in the comments. Indoor outdoor shoe culture is genuinely amazing.  \n\nI'm Australian, and it's always been shoes on for me, and no division between indoor/outdoor shoes. Often it's better to have shoes on inside, cause there can be spiders and stuff in the house. I use thongs (flip flops) mostly, as my casual inside/outside wear. Just have a door mat and wipe my shoes before entering.  \nI have trainers that I use for more active stuff, and I will wear them inside too. Same deal, just wipe them on the mat.  \nIf I have particularly muddy shoes or step in something, I wash off my shoes and let them dry and swap to another pair of shoes.  \nI understand hygiene and cleanliness is a thing, but your hands are similar. Washing them helps ofc. But your phone is crazy nasty, unless you're wiping it down with disinfectant wipes. I'm way more worried about the germs on my phone than my shoes.  \n\nUnless your roommate is tracking in literal mud and shit on his shoes, then I think the request is unreasonable. If it's just normal amounts of shoe dirt (as in, barely visible to the eye) then it's not a fair request that he don't wear his regular (to him) shoes in a house he pays for too.  \nWhere he is being unreasonable, is his insistence that he will put his feet and shoes in the furniture you intend to buy. That's a Dick Move. Disrespectful. I would hold off on buying the new furniture.  \nSounds like you're just incompatible as housemates due to your living standards and lifestyles. That's fine. But you both live there and pay rent. You can choose not to wear certain shoes inside, but you can't demand him to do that same.
