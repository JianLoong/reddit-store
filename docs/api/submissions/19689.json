However, the carpets in our bedrooms are filthy, so I was OK with wearing shoes inside the house, even though it still made me feel kind of gross. Our landlord has agreed to professionally clean the carpets, so this is where the AITA conversation begins:\n\n* I asked my roommate if he would agree to no longer wear his outdoor shoes inside the house.\n* He says no - He has to wear shoes all the time per his podiatrist.\n* I say fair enough would he get a separate pair of indoor shoes.\n* He says his outside shoes are clean, and he is not walking in my room where the carpet is anyway\n* I say we literally live in an area where tons of dogs and sadly lots of homeless people poop on the sidewalks, and that if the rest of the apartment floor is dirty that will quickly track into my own room. At this point I offer to just buy him a pair of indoor shoes from Costco.\n* He says no - it will be too inconvenient to switch shoes whenever he needs to run out to his car or to grab a bite to eat.\n* I am frustrated at this point and say okay well if you are insisting on wearing outdoor shoes inside, can you please do a lap with the swiffer at night. I propose this will take maybe a minute since we don't have all that much space and I will buy the Swiffer too.\n* He says no, and contests that it will take up to two minutes. Acknowledges he should clean the floor more often and offers to do it once a week.\n* I am more frustrated and point out that I have offered many compromises, but he is simply unwilling to move from \"I am wearing outdoor shoes inside and will only clean the floors once a week.\"\n* He acknowledges he is potentially being stubborn. Mentions he maybe needs to make an AITA thread. Hence me doing this now.\n* I then say I am planning to buy a large ottoman to replace our coffee table that needs to be replaced, and I don't want him putting his outdoor shoes on it.\n* He says he will be putting his shoes on it.\n* At this point I say let's sleep on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously I am only pointing out my POV as that's all anyone can ever provide.

You will both have to compromise to find a mutually acceptable solution.  Sounds like you are willing to do that.  He is maybe being a little more unflexable that you are.  \n\nWould he be willing to use shoe covers (you may have to provide).

No the bottom of the shoe", "NTA, you offered ample compromise, including buying items to make it easier for your roommate. Also your furniture, your rules.

I also have very nice slippers/house shoes that have nice arch support and it\u2019s nbd to switch to them when I come home.", "I don't know anyone who wears their outside shoes inside. Rank. Nta", "NAH. As someone else pointed out, it really comes down to cultural difference/how you were raised. My family always wore shoes inside the house (or at least didn\u2019t take them off at the door, obviously it\u2019s more comfortable to relax in slippers/socks/bare feet!), so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with shoes on inside. I\u2019m kind of laughing at some of these comments suggesting that wearing shoes inside the house is, like, an affront to god and nature\u2026I just wasn\u2019t raised that way! And so it\u2019s not disrespectful or considered unclean to do it, from my POV. \n\nHowever, I have friends who were raised with different norms and they always take their shoes off when they come over, even though I don\u2019t ask them to. \n\nWhen I go to someone else\u2019s house, I respect whatever their routine is \u2014 more than happy to take my shoes off in someone else\u2019s space. I think the conflict comes down to the fact that your roommate isn\u2019t in someone else\u2019s home, he\u2019s in his own. And because it\u2019s his space too, he doesn\u2019t see a reason to change what he\u2019s always done, even though it\u2019s opposite of what you\u2019ve always done and consider normal/appropriate/respectful. \n\nI think a fair compromise would be: he doesn\u2019t put his shoes on the furniture (now THAT is nasty\u2026), swiffers the floor at least once a week (more often if he tracks anything into the house), and doesn\u2019t go in your room/private space with his outdoor shoes.

The idea that basic cleanliness is soooo unusual is frankly bizarre.", "I appreciate that, but I don\u2019t think the question posed was whether or not outdoor shoes track dirt inside the house. I know that they do! And when my shoes are extra dirty of course I take them off at the door. But people have different comfort levels with the level of cleanliness in their living space, and the misalignment there between the roommates is the crux of this post.  \n\nFwiw, someone literally on this comment thread said they have \u201cevolved\u201d into a shoes off person \u2014 that implies a moral judgement. Other comments also convey moral judgements: saying the roommate is an AH simply for wearing shoes indoors, he\u2019s disgusting, he\u2019s unhinged\u2026.. I don\u2019t think anywhere in my original comment I made a moral argument. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than other people bc I don\u2019t take my shoes off inside my own home. But it seems like many people who DO, think they are better than those who don\u2019t.", "Congrats to your in-laws. That is pretty uncommon, imo, but perhaps I\u2019m wrong. I never called it weird or unusual. I don\u2019t care what other people do in their homes. I am happy to respect the rules in other people\u2019s homes. But there is MASSIVE judgement and condescension in this thread towards people who don\u2019t take their shoes off. Not everyone is raised to do that, and not everyone thinks it\u2019s gross \u2014 even if there is statistically more dirt on their floors. \n\nIn my area it\u2019s very uncommon to take your shoes off at the door. In some regions it\u2019s the norm. Some people let their pets on the furniture, while others do not. Do the people who let their dog or cat on the couch objectively have more germs on their couch than people who don\u2019t? Sure. Is it worth moralizing over? Not in my opinion."]}
