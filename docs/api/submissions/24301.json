We were visiting his family yesterday and his mother told me that his sister thought that the dress she (MIL) had picked out was inappropriate for the wedding and she asked if she could show me the dress to get my opinion. I agreed to look at it, and I fully agreed with my SIL - it was a knee-length white lace dress. MIL had another dress in mind as a back-up that was still white but at least had flowers of various colours that covered most of the dress so it overall was mostly not white. I told her I liked this other dress much better.\n\nI then asked my SIL, just out of curiosity while we were talking about dresses, what she was planning on wearing. She showed me a picture of the dress she bought for the wedding and I was floored. She had picked out a floor-length pale blush dress with mesh and beading that easily could have been a wedding dress itself (I am actually wearing a pale blush dress with beading, but mine has a fuller skirt and more detailed beading). I told her very gently that I thought it looked like a wedding dress and I didn't think it was appropriate to wear to someone else's wedding. She asked me if I wanted her to wear something else and I said yes. \n\nSIL was later texting my fianc\u00e9 saying that the dress was pink and I was being unreasonable. She sent more pictures of the dress, and while in some lighting it looked light pink, in other pictures it looked white. Combined with the style, I still felt it was inappropriate. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and my mother are saying that I'm being unreasonable by asking both of these women to wear a different dress that's not white to my wedding. Neither SIL nor MIL need to buy a new dress, but it seems that they both bought these white dresses specifically for the wedding.

You don\u2019t wear white to a wedding.", "NTA - SIL thought MILs knee length white dress wasn\u2019t appropriate, but saw no issue with her floor length off-white dress? Strange. It\u2019s your wedding day, you have every right to not let this slide. It\u2019s common sense to not wear anything resembling a wedding dress to a wedding.", "NTA.\n\nIt's commonly accepted that the one to wear white is the bride and not the guests.  Only exception is if the BRIDE asks others to wear white.  Guests don't get to make the decision themselves.", "My mil wore what looked like a white bridal dress to my bil\u2019s wedding.  We were looking at the wedding photos and she said \u201cit looks white in the photos!\u201d  I told her I thought it was white and got a death glare from her.  I assume it was called \u2018blush\u2019 or something like that and she was pretending it wasn\u2019t white but for everyone else it was white.", "NTA. You dont wear white or close to white at a wedding.", "Dear OP there is a reason why only the bride alone can wear white at the wedding and it is known thing for years. So NTA on you. If you are a bride who is wearing a non-white bridal gown and you come up with a dress code for all the guests that too is understandable", "NTA. This seems to be a pretty basic wedding rule that they're breaking. Besides, MIL asked for your opinion and you gave it. Now she wants to argue about it? SMH", "NTA - if someone has to fight that hard that it\u2019s not white, it\u2019s too close to white. And if you\u2019re wearing light pink, they shouldn\u2019t be!", "NTA\n\nBut a colorful print dress that happens to have\na white background is not a white dress. Guests shouldn\u2019t wear all white, but they can certainly have some white in their outfit. The MIL\u2019s second choice dress is fine. Just because there is some white in the print does not make it a white dress.\n\nFor the SIL\u2014did she know OP\u2019s dress was blush? The rule really is that you should not dress like the bride and most brides wear white, so that\u2019s where the no white rule comes in.\n\nIf SIL knew ahead of time that OP\u2019s dress was blush, then she made a bad choice with the blush dress. If she didn\u2019t know, she was okay with to the choice of a pale pink dress. Any pastel color can get washed out to a white appearance by lights. Doesn\u2019t mean guests can\u2019t wear those colors. But again, it is not a white dress. Why are you calling it a white dress?\n\nWhat you should have said to SIL is that your wedding dress is the same color and she should have realized that she needed a different dress.", "NTA. You don\u2019t wear white/cream/off white/pale pink (that could be white) and definitely not one that looks like a wedding dress. If your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t going to back you on this then he\u2019s not gonna back you on a lot of other stuff.  It seems like they\u2019re (MIL and SIL) are doing this on purpose. He needs to talk to them and back you up. Because I\u2019m petty af I\u2019d tell them if they wear those dresses then they\u2019ll need a change of clothes as red wine will be spilled.", "NTA\n\nBut Im always tempted to ask in these situations why they would want to wear something that made it look like they wanted to marry/fuck their son/brother.", "NTA - They are being disrespectful to your wishes. If your finance doesn't understand, then be ready for other issues in your marriage. \n\nBest of luck OP, hopefully you show your future partner these posts so they can understand how unfair they're being. \n\nIt's a slippery slope.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's both the SIL and the MIL that are doing this.. which suggests there's a deeper issue here.

That might be the first red flag you've noticed.  What you want is a partner that sticks up for you.. not one that tells you, you have to pander to his mother.\n\nIt may be less of a problem now.. but when you have kids... well you might have a very big issue.\n\nI'd probably suggest that you have a good long hard think about whether you have a supportive partner and whether things need to change before you follow through with the wedding.  You may have some difficult decisions to make.", "NTA. They are. Not wearing white to a wedding is a very easy rule to respect.", "NTA.
