I gave her a call after a lot of people asked me to reach out again and asked her straight up what she wanted, did she want us out of her life, what is going on and to please be honest. She was quiet for a bit and hung up after saying give her some time. I thought that was the end of it and she would reach out later or never.\n\nWell on Monday she showed up at our house after a 8 hour drive. Sara sat both of us down and told the full story what was going on. She was happy with eloping and just didn't want to spend money on a wedding (we knew this one). For the baby, she was never pregnant. Her husband cheated on her and got another women pregnant. Sara found out about 2 months before the kid was born. She didn't tell us because Sara knew we would tell her to leave him (100 percent true). She wanted to fix the marriage and in doing that she kept it a secret so her husband wouldn't get any backlash. She told us the only reason they were able to met Dave was due to biomom dropping the kid off so she could visit her family across the country, there is no custody agreement. It's been a huge mess on there end and the marriage is rough at the moment.\n\nSara was planning to go to Christmas at our place at the beginning and explain the situation but Dave would be with biomom and husband didn't want the secret out. So when we called her saying we were going to take a step back Sara was very upset. She thought she was losing her family over a secret to protect her husband. Her husband didn't help since he never had close family so he didn't understand why she was upset. Sara and her husband got in a huge argument about the whole thing ordeal. When I called again she already made up her mind that she will be telling us and going to Christmas at our house. She took time off and drove down and will stay for Christmas.\n\nShe doesn't know what she will due with her husband and if she will try to fix it or leave. She did tell us to stay out of it since she wants her decision to 100 percent on her. We will respect that even though we are hoping she leaves him for this stunt.\n\nThank you everyone that commented on the last post, you had some great advice and made us really think what was going on.", "created_utc": 1671825552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztr4dv/update_aita_for_being_upset_that_i_wont_see_my/", "score": 2253, "replies": ["Damn, reddit really makes it clear I should be more grateful for a relatively uncomplicated life.", "Glad to hear things worked out, OP.

I hope your daughter finds some direction during her stay with you over Christmas. Good luck to you, and her.", "Thanks for the update, it's actually nice to see it was not a case of missing missing reason ls from the parents end for a change.  Her husband has done a right number, I hope she realises after something like this it's going to be near impossible to put the relationship back snd his idea of hiding the reality of his child is impossible.", "I KNEW there was something going on with the husband!! Unfortunately I have a lot of experience being in relationships with controlling and/abusive men. I would almost guarantee the elopement was not about money, but about control. Same with the moving 2 states away. Controlling men do not want you to have contact with family or friends who might see through their BS and tell you to leave them, so they isolate you. I\u2019m so sorry this is all going on. Your daughter will be in my prayers as she figures this all out.", "Damn that was not a square on AITA bingo. Was not expecting that plot twist. Glad your daughter was able to come to you,  and hope everything works out happily! Merry Christmas.", "Didn\u2019t see that one coming! I didn\u2019t get the AH judgements on here from your original post, it sounds like you are kind and loving parents - I\u2019m glad you have made up with your daughter\n\nGive her space, but let her know that whatever happens you are there for her.", "Damn, sorry on behalf of all of the people who said you were an issue in the first post, now we know the real story and you really didn't do anything wrong! Sorry to your daughter too, she's in such a messy situation because of her shit husband and doesn't deserve that. I hope you support her in any way you can, I know she's been hurting this whole time.", "I read the posts in the reverse order and I still felt like the OP\u2019s reaction was really off in the first post. Like most people who have a normal relationship with their child, would react differently when the child doesn\u2019t tell them about getting married and having a baby. OP decided to go LC instead of trying to talk to her about it.", "Missing reasons is a thing but what people forget or purposefully ignore is that it's not just a thing terrible parents do but anyone and everyone can do.", "Yeah there were certainly projection-filled comments written by assholes, but there were also balanced and fair comments that provided a range of possibilities in a calm and measured manner so that was cool to see. \n\n3 out of the 4 top comments actually said that they couldn\u2019t make a judgement as there was not enough information available. u/aunty_fascist, u/tctx73, and u/sunnydelights95 \u2014 here\u2019s the update and thanks for your original comments.", "And it's because of reactions like that that Daughter alienated herself in the first place.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

This is very much another \"you can't help people who don't want to be helped\" moment. She's not a toddler who needs her parents to swoop in a save her. An adult having to have her parents swoop in and save them unless it's life or death is just going to embarrass them and not open up ever again.\n\nHopefully this time apart during Christmas and letting her have time to think because she's not in the thick of it anymore will be the push that helps her realize that trying to make that mess of a marriage work is pointless and to go for the divorce.", "The way people try to one up each other is fucking crazy, it seems like everyone wants to be the one blessed with the gift of prophecy by Apollo or whatever because they want to be the one who \"called it\", or they can't fathom that things don't need to be huge telanovela levels of convoluted familial drama.\n\nThis mindset of \"Well you MUST HAVE done something wrong so I'm going to make things up and call you an awful person based on absolutely nothing\" needs to stop.", "I don't know, I guess I was just raised in a closer family than this. My family would never let me ruin my life like that, and I can't imagine staying quiet if someone like my sister were in this situation.", "Well done for recognising that reacting like that would do more harm than good!"]}
