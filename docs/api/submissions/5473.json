I gave her a call after a lot of people asked me to reach out again and asked her straight up what she wanted, did she want us out of her life, what is going on and to please be honest. She was quiet for a bit and hung up after saying give her some time. I thought that was the end of it and she would reach out later or never.\n\nWell on Monday she showed up at our house after a 8 hour drive. Sara sat both of us down and told the full story what was going on. She was happy with eloping and just didn't want to spend money on a wedding (we knew this one). For the baby, she was never pregnant. Her husband cheated on her and got another women pregnant. Sara found out about 2 months before the kid was born. She didn't tell us because Sara knew we would tell her to leave him (100 percent true). She wanted to fix the marriage and in doing that she kept it a secret so her husband wouldn't get any backlash. She told us the only reason they were able to met Dave was due to biomom dropping the kid off so she could visit her family across the country, there is no custody agreement. It's been a huge mess on there end and the marriage is rough at the moment.\n\nSara was planning to go to Christmas at our place at the beginning and explain the situation but Dave would be with biomom and husband didn't want the secret out. So when we called her saying we were going to take a step back Sara was very upset. She thought she was losing her family over a secret to protect her husband. Her husband didn't help since he never had close family so he didn't understand why she was upset. Sara and her husband got in a huge argument about the whole thing ordeal. When I called again she already made up her mind that she will be telling us and going to Christmas at our house. She took time off and drove down and will stay for Christmas.\n\nShe doesn't know what she will due with her husband and if she will try to fix it or leave. She did tell us to stay out of it since she wants her decision to 100 percent on her. We will respect that even though we are hoping she leaves him for this stunt.\n\nThank you everyone that commented on the last post, you had some great advice and made us really think what was going on.", "created_utc": 1671825552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztr4dv/update_aita_for_being_upset_that_i_wont_see_my/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Damn, reddit really makes it clear I should be more grateful for a relatively uncomplicated life.", "Glad to hear things worked out, OP. Sorry your daughter is going through a rough time, but at least y'all are back to more healthy communication.", "Wow poor girl, be there for her, she is going through so much.", "Oh gosh I *knew* it was the husband, although I didn't expect the twist. A lot of the posters assumed you were the real villain but some stuff about Sara's behavior just didn't line up with that theory. \n\nI hope Sara makes the right decision.", "Amazing how much a conversation can solve. I'm glad that she was able to be open with you. As a mom, if I were you, and I suspect you have already done this, I would tell her that whatever she needs from you, she can have it. You won't say I told you so if she wants to try with the husband and it fails. You will accept all her choices and you won't judge. I say that because I'm guessing she's going to need someone to talk to and she is going to want to talk with you. You will offer opinions and be a sounding board if she needs it.  She sounds level headed but in a tough situation and knowing that you're going to have her back whether she follows your advice or not will be huge for. \n\nHave a merry Christmas and enjoy one another.", "I wonder how many of the people who were quick to shit all over OP on the first post will see this and regret what they said? Probably not enough of them.", "wow, this is such a swerve on the 'missing missing reasons' reddit is so quick to jump onto. damn. best of luck for you both and your daughter.", "I'm glad you at least understand what's going on.  I know it's got to be disappointing to find out that Dave isn't your grandson, but your daughter was trying to handle things as best as she possibly could.\n\nBe supportive of your daughter while she's in your home.  Do not offer advice unless she asks for it.  Your daughter already knows your position.  Her head knows your right.  Her heart is involved in this process, too, though.  She just needs time to process what's happening and accept that she can't stay with her husband and think things are going to get any better with him.", "yeah your daughter is old enough to make her idiotic mistakes. staying with a cheating husband who had a love child with his mistress will be the biggest mistake of her life.", "Thanks for being a great parent, putting yourself aside and letting Sara decide what to do while knowing her family is there for her", "Wow. Amazing things happen when you reach out. I hope you guys have a wonderful visit. And I hope everything works out for her.", "\"Relatively uncomplicated\" I see what you did there. :)", "I hope Sara is being meticulous with her birth control.  She needs to get tested for STD's as well."]}
