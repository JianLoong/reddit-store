She has a history of placing you, your cat, your home, your car, and who else knows what else in danger with her behavior and doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Absolutely NTA to assure your well being and safety when she\u2019s placed it in danger so many times.", "NTA and just want to add that the race issue is something it\u2019s easy for HER to dismiss out of hand but is a completely fair point for you to raise. Perhaps you could explain to her the implications of her behaviour for you as a black women who has to be SO much more careful. \n\nI remember a conversation with a friend of mine where she challenged my assumption that she could just go to the police about something (I\u2019m white, she\u2019s Black, but we live in the UK so it is a little bit less extreme (still lots of systemic racism but no guns!)), and she pointed out that, as one of the only black households in an apartment block, she had to be extra careful not to fall into the trope of the \u2018angry/aggressive black people\u2019. It made me have a word with myself about taking my privilege for granted and perhaps a word with your friend might do the same?\n\nHaving said that, given your \u2018friend\u2019s\u2019 behaviour you don\u2019t owe her anything so only do that if you want to because you would be perfectly within your rights to tell her just \u2018no\u2019.", "NTA and you don't need her in your life..she will get you in trouble", "NTA.\n\nAnd you\u2019re black so coke meth and ketamine at your house likely means ten or so years in prison for you without any consideration that the white girl brought it.\n\nWeed is legal.  So it\u2019s a difference between a disapproving look by a cop and sacrificing your freedom?  Lul no.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have her there at all.  I don\u2019t have a close enough friend to check all the places she might be hiding drugs and I definitely don\u2019t have a friend I\u2019d give up my life for.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, because it sounds like she\u2019s on a fast track to death or jail.  Be supportive, but you are under NO obligation to let her choices drag you down with her.", "Isn\u2019t it funny how whenever BIPOC express that they expect any type of accountability from white people we\u2019re making them uncomfortable or treating them like dogs\u2026.\n\n\nHow do they view how they treat us? What does she think about putting your life in jeopardy for a quick high\u2026.prison or worse if a cop finds that in your possession bc it\u2019s in your house or car.\n\nNTA and you\u2019re not being overdramatic. \n\nYour \u2018friends\u2019 are entitled and they\u2019re gaslighting you.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA. I wish weed was legal in the UK. Love the occasional joint.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Yeah \"Piper\" is a total liability & you're within your rights to protect yourself.", "Nta. I had a new friend bring drugs into my husbands car when we picked her up once. I absolutely lost it. Im like you and smoke pot and drink, but no way do i want that association. Like you said what if your cat found it? And my reasoning was what if we got pulled over. Its inconsiderate and rude of them!", "I used to have a lot more friends than I do now. But I just had to walk away from a lot of them when they went down a drug path I just couldn\u2019t follow. I had kids. I just couldn\u2019t have that shit in my life, and definitely not around my kids, so they had to go. But that\u2019s a common thing about friendships as you all grow up. Many times, you also grow apart. People start making choices about their lives that just don\u2019t mesh with your choices anymore. It might be sad, but it\u2019s reality. You WILL outgrow some friends at some point. It\u2019s ok. You can make new, more compatible friends along the way. This is just reality, and it\u2019s way past time to cut off Piper.", "NTA. Cut her and any friends defending her out of your life. She is risking your freedom and your (and your cat's) wellbeing. And definitely don't use any of her weed.", "NTA. She sheds drugs like my dog does hair, except dog hair isn't a felony.", "Pretty sure we all know what would have happened to her sadly\ud83d\ude15", "Jesus. So I did. My bad.", "Yes, but it's fuckin gross to sexualize children so let's just all use u/Maximum-Win-7201's definition instead", ">I told her IF she wants to come I\u2019m picking her up at her house and I\u2019m searching her entire body and purse to make sure she doesnt have anything because every other time she\u2019s lied and brought it anyway. \n\nDude, why?\n\nJust say no, she's not worth the trouble. NTA", "NTA but why are you friends with this person?", "NTA. It's your home. Thus your rules and considering who's likely to get arrested....", "I\u2019ve never thought about it, but I guess I have a rule to never let anyone who does meth into my house.  The other ones aren\u2019t great either, but meth!?  METH!?  Anyway, NTA", "I have told long time friends of mine to \"fuck off and die\" for using meth. I live in an area \"Puget Sound WA\" that has a big problem with meth and I see nothing wrong with cutting people out of my life that I se hard drugs.\n\nNTA \n\nYou are the friends you keep.", "NTA. I'll admit to using drugs beyond weed (MDMA, ketamine) but there's a time and a place for that stuff and a Friendsgiving dinner is not it.", "NTA", "NTA. I avoid addicts like the black plague because they\u2019re almost always dishonest people. I\u2019d keep her out of your house just to make sure nothing gets stolen.", "NTA but drop this person out of your life. Why do you want this person around you at all?", "NTA. I would drop her. She is obviously dealing with some issues if she's that cavalier about drugs. She's going to get the whole group of you busted one day. Cops really don't care if you weren't using. Being in the presence of drugs makes you guilty by association.", "NTA at least dogs bring most people joy, she just seems to bring stress and audacity", "NTA, OP there is no equating smoking a joint and meth!  All the other stuff about race and cops massively compounds things in your favor but the basic premise is extremely reasonable!  'Do not bring coke, ketamine, or meth into my house' isn't just reasonable it's literally the law!  She's literally shown she can't be trusted not to respect something so basic, I honestly don't see what 'give' there could be to justify a 'friend' like that but that's your call.", "NTA  \n\n\nI'm all about weed all day EVERYDAY. But I don't mess with meth heads or meth. As the great Hunter S Thompson said \"Never turn your back on a drug\"", "NTA. There's obviously a big difference between enjoying a joint every now and then and bringing ketamine and meth to someone's house. She could easily get you arrested or worse.", "Ask the cop from a few over to come do searches on people before then enter your home. \ud83e\udd23\n\nOkay, not really. That would definitely piss off your other friends. \n\nYou are NTA for not inviting her. She sounds very irresponsible with her drugs. She could have killed your cat. She could have gotten you in trouble with the syringe. \n\nI have a feeling she is more than just using if she has to have her drugs everywhere with her. And the number she has on her? She has to be dealing, even if at a low level. It could be how she is supporting her habit. \n\nYou don't need to be around that crap. It might be time to end that friendship. You don't want to get in trouble because of her stupidity.", "You\u2019re not wrong. Too risky.", "Plus intravenous drugs are not \"party\" drugs or even the kind you can really say are recreational. If you're injecting it, you're likely a full blown addict.\n\nIt's upsetting that 2 of the other friends do not see this.", "Especially after being told multiple times not to do it.", "You are missing the point: it's a gross term because \"to sexualize children\" is exactly what it means. If you ever hear \"jail bait\" you are probably not having a SFW conversation. It's a pretty specific bit of slang. This is like that meme going around with the mom who thought \"bukkake\" meant \"bullshit\" and was saying it in front of kids. \n\nThe term y'all are looking for is \"heat magnet\": that one friend who is always getting busted or bringing \"the heat\".", "It's not *that* specific.\n\nLike sitting around in a stolen car is jail bait. It's bait for jail. It doesn't just mean underage girls", "No, it really is slang for an underage girl, not for doing stupid shit.", "jail\u00b7bait\n/\u02c8j\u0101l\u02ccb\u0101t/\nLearn to pronounce\nnounINFORMAL\na young woman, or young women collectively, considered in sexual terms but under the age of consent.\n\nStraight from Oxford dictionary"]}
