She sounds like she\u2019s an addict, and also a toddler. Her behavior has put you at risk more than once. She\u2019s lost the privilege of being automatically trusted.", "NTA. Big difference between legal weed and the shit Piper wants to bring.\n\nI've been in a similar situation myself with a friend bringing drugs into my home (I have kids and personally don't do drugs - not even weed). Let's just say words were had and he hasn't done it since.", "NTA tell her you'd prefer a dog, as they actually listen.", "You might need new friends. People who bring drugs after promising they won't are the type that'll deny its theirs too. You're doin a great job protecting yourself. NTA", "NTA at all! Weed is drastically different than the hard drugs she negligently brings around you, to your home. The negligent part is what sticks out to me the most\u2014 leaving coke on your counter and dirty needles in your car? Those are serious risks.", "NTA.  Piper has a serious drug problem that she needs to get a handle on.  Leaving a needle in someone's car?  That's awful.  What if you'd been reaching in the back seat and pricked yourself?  She's proven she can't be trusted with her drug use, and I wouldn't want the risk to come onto me either, if I were in your place.  If the cop hears a huge party, knocks on your door, and finds meth on the counter, you're in trouble.\n\nRegardless of my stance or feelings on drugs, there's a massive difference between weed and ketamine or meth.\n\nI think you might be better cutting Piper out of your life.", "NTA. She's a walking liability.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries, and not wanting hardcore drugs in your house isn\u2019t unreasonable. Especially as a Black person who would almost certainly be the one held responsible if things did go wrong. And she\u2019s lied before. She sounds like she needs professional help for substance abuse", "NTA \nThe \"drugs\" you do are both legal and basically harmless and you're not going to get into trouble with what you're doing in your home.\n\nIt's your home! You don't want the hard drugs there, it could lead to big trouble for you if anything went wrong.  I'd just straight up ban her from coming.  If she can't be away from hard drugs for a few hours to spend a fun friend night together then leave her behind.  Your home your rules!\n\nEdit because I'm stupid and put nah instead of nta because I don't know what I'm even doing.", "NTA. Your house your rules", "NTA! Wow, Piper sounds like trouble for SO many reasons \ud83d\ude2c. Yikes.", "NTA, if she can't abide by the rules in YOUR HOME and CAR, then she has a huge drug problem. Marijuana is very acceptable to most people nowadays but cocaine, needles, meth, etc. Is a whole different situation that you don't need caught up in. What if you get pulled over and your car searched because of her. I had a friend of 23yrs that I kicked to the curb, after years of me telling her to not bring drugs to my house. I've never even felt guilty about ditching the friendship after I realized she didn't care enough about it to visit my home without drugs.", "NTA. It's not your job to educate the \"friends\" who don't understand how Piper's actions can have dangerous consequences for you, I suggest appointing a few trusted friends to run interference educating (and/or uninviting) the ignorant.", "NTA and I'm not sure this person is your friend.", "NTA.

You have every right to set your boundaries and uphold them. It is on your friends to respect those boundaries. I think it\u2019s really good to have boundaries and to let people know them. It shows you who respects you and who wants to use you.", "NTA. Why be friends with her?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nA very good general rule is don't be friends or hang around with people who use intravenous drugs :/", "NTA \n\nYou should exclude her from Thanksgiving.  The behavior you\u2019ve described is unconscionable. \n\nIf your friend is arrested for drugs and you\u2019re with her, are you at risk for very serious consequences?  Despite your innocence?  I think so.  What\u2019s worse is she\u2019s proven she doesn\u2019t care about the risk she poses to those around her.
