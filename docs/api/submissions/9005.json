Last week my in-laws invited my family over for dinner. This is the first time my family and his family have had a proper dinner party (obv not counting the wedding) so it was a big celebration as well. My step sister 'Lisa' (f24) came as well. Context: Lisa is very conventionally beautiful. Like, she could give any current model a run for their money. She did receive a couple of offers to do ads and such when she started college, but she turned it all down. Lisa recently finished her bachelor's in math and astronomy, with very good results, and is looking to start post grad. \n\nOkay so back to dinner, towards the end everyone was chatting and my BIL was talking to Lisa. At one point, he said something like \"Who needs to study when you can get whatever you want with a pretty face like that?\". Lisa got really quiet for a moment, then replied he should stay in his lane and control what he's saying, in a very snarky, rude tone. Mind you this was in front of my in-laws, so they could see Lisa being so snarky in front of everyone. \n\nMy BIL said he was just giving her a compliment and she took it the wrong way. Lisa walked off, and I went to talk to her, saying that she overreacted and is now making a scene in front of my in-laws. What my BIL said might have been distasteful, sure, but it's barely anything to get so worked up over and sometimes it's important to be the bigger person, instead of talking so rudely.\n\nLisa then got mad at me and is still refusing to answer to my text. I don't think I told her anything that bad and I said it all nicely, not going off at people like she was.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675396829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10sahfn/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_overreacted_after/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

AITA?\"", "YTA - Your sister seemed like she was overreacting to you, because you have not heard that comment as many times as I can guarantee she has going into the field she is in. She's probably constantly on the defensive about it. \n\nAnd I mean, BILs comment was NOT meant to suggest \"become a model\" it was meant to suggest she could became some rich guys sugar baby or trophy wife. Gross.", "YTA.  Nobody says stuff like your BIL did and actually means to compliment.  Comments like that are meant to be completely dismissive of folks who are actually trying to do something with their lives.", "YTA. That is what we would call a backhanded compliment.  He was putting down her accomplishments.  I would have been upset too.", "YTA why would you let that fly with your BIL. I would never let anyone say that about my sister. \nHe literally objectified her in front of everyone. Which is also disgusting.\n\nEwwwww", "YTA \n\nYour brother in law's comment was far from a compliment. Iy was inappropriate.  It was disrespectful. It was dismissive. It was was many things. None of them good thiings. Your sister didn't over react to his comment at all.\n\nYour support of your brother in law in this situation is beyond disappointing. Your lack of respect for your sister is beyond disappointing.\n\nI wouldn't respond to you either.", "YTA, yo, math and astronomy is really really difficult. Put some respect on your sister's name.

My reaction would\u2019ve far worse than hers for sure, and she deserves so much praise for her handling of the situation. She has every right to defend herself against your BIL\u2019s comments.

That with her pretty face, she can do little to nothing to get what she wants? How is that a compliment?", "YTA. An inlaw objectified her and dismissed her intellectual achievement, then when called on it, he started to minimize her feelings. I guarantee she's heard this before. People using it as a shitty pick up line. Men in her classes sneering it at her. It was a rude and insensitive comment. Why should she police her tone?

It was degrading.\n\nHe owes your sister an apology for telling her being educated isn\u2019t valuable for an attractive woman.  BIL was out of line, and your sister called him on it.

Realize that she could have been mildly good looking and your bil would likely have said the same thing upon discovering .......\n\n>Lisa recently finished her bachelor's in math and astronomy, with very good results, and is looking to start post grad. \n\n\nIt's not uncommon that women's educational accomplishments are minimalized by unhappy men to feel superior by talking about their looks to make them feel uncomfortable.  \n\n\nYou're in the wrong and it appears that you don't care that much about your sister.

Your sister is a brilliant and hard working woman, and your BIL completely tore that down and said all she has to be is pretty.  It's pretty damn sexist and inappropriate.

You then call your sister and apologize for not backing her up.", "YTA. It\u2019s not nothing. It\u2019s a microaggression. It perpetuates the sexism that runs through society.

Your husband said something disgusting to your stepsister. His behavior was unacceptable and you should have addressed it.\n\nYour stepsister came to a family gathering to support you.

She is a person and doesn't deserve to be treated like an object by a man with no manners.", "YTA what your BIL said WAS distasteful AND degrading, disrespectful and so much more. He reduced her to her looks and dismissed everything else about her. And in SUCH a patronizing tone. Your husband needs to tell his brother than he\u2019s an ass and you need to apologize to your sister.", "YTA \n\nHer achievements should be dismissed and downplayed because of her looks? \n\nShe is clearly very intelligent and I'd bet that she has dealt with people dismissing that because of her looks \n\nShe wants to be treated like a person not am object, she isn't just there to have her looks admired", "YTA. I hope she goes no contact with your ass", "YTA there\u2019s no overreaction nor is there a scene", "YTA.  What brother in law said is demeaning and misogynistic.  In this day and age is it still considered impossible that a woman can have brains and beauty?  He belittled her education and career then you doubled down and put the blame on her.", "YTA. Sexual harassment is never okay. He wasn\u2019t complimenting her, he was being a creep. And she put him in his place.", "She did not overreact. YTA.", "YTA. Your BIL basically said to your sister that whatever comes out of her mouth doesn't matter because all he is thinking about is having sex with her. And you take *his* side in this???? \n\nAnd you think it's a compliment that he said her personality/intelligence/effort/work ethic is worth NOTHING because she happens to be sexually attractive as well??", "YTA. Your BIL was misogynistic and you\u2019re showing your own internal misogyny. She responded more nicely than I would have.", "\"My BIL sexually harassed my step sister and I blamed her for being validly upset\"\n\n\n\nStop victim blaming. It's beyond obvious you're jealous of her looks and intelligence. You were looking for any excuse to take her down a peg because you couldn't handle not feeling like you were as beautiful or smart as her.\n\n\n\n100% YTA jealousy and tearing down other women is disgusting. A good person would kick BIL out and tell him not to come back until he stops verbally abusing and disrespecting women.", "YTA\n\nWhy am I surprised that you dismissed her feelings about your BIL\u2019s gross, demeaning and inappropriate comment; when the first thing you said about your accomplished step sister with degrees in math and astronomy, is about her looks. The misogyny is coming from ~inside the house~", "YTA. Women's intelligence and capabilities have been undermined for far too long because men view them as sexual objects who weaponize their looks. Her reaction was totally appropriate. You're enabling your BIL and his sexist antics by saying she overreacted", "OP you tried covering yourself and putting yourself in the \"right\" when you kept pushing heavily about her looks and her potential modeling options and then sliding in the \"bachelors in math and astronomy\" comment.

Rethink things next time and make amends with her because she can't divorce you but your husband's family can.", "YTA - that was blatant negging on your BIL's part and you just condoned it. Have some principles", "YTA.  Your BIL insulted your sister.  Defending her would have been the right thing to do, right then, right there at the table.  Having your sister's back is more important than pretending that something unacceptable didn't happen, poof, let's ignore it, to keep the peace.  What your sister said to BIL was appropriate; she didn't \"go off\" at him.", "YTA what BIL said was degrading he said she uses her looks and not brains no one says this to men.

You should have jumped in with both feet to support her. Your BIL said something truly demeaning to her and she did not overreact in letting him know how utterly repugnant his comment was. He should have copped an earful from you as well. Apologise to your sister.", "YTA\n\nWhy was it ok for you BIL to sexually harass her, but not ok for her to tell him to \"stay in his lane\"?

Where the heck have you been the last 6 years?  You're a woman, why are you standing up for this jerk?", "YTA. Your sister handled it perfectly, you did not.", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t a compliment, it was a comment reducing your sister to her looks. It certainly was distasteful and incredibly offensive and rude. She had every right to respond the way she did.

Rude words deserve a rude response.
