We have been together for 4 and half years. Together we raise my 10 year old autistic son who is about to start ABA therapy. 2 cats and a dog who is best friends with at least one of the cats. \n\nWe currently live in his house that he inherited from his mom after she passed. While she was alive i would help take care of her and change her and clean her as she was obease and bedridden after a horrible accident. I adored his mom and helped her finally move into an actual room instead of the living room filled with clutter and trash. \n\nI had cleaned this house from top to bottom (his mom was a hoarder of everything as she was also an artist, so trash and cockroaches were everywhere) i spent 100's of hours working on this house and made it into a decent home where there was no clutter with the exception of my sons craft for the day. She passed at the beginning of 2020. \n\nAbout a month ago he comes up to me and wants to have a talk. That this isn't working for him and that if we haven't gotten married by now we aren't going to and he wants to be alone. I am calm about it as id been feeling a drift from him for a while now. I've stayed calm through out the whole thing as I don't want my son to know until he absolutely has to as we are all still living together. \n\nAfter the break up we had planned on moving into the new house as he was selling his house to pay off medical bills from his parents. The sell hasn't happened yet and I've asked him neumerious times that asking for a clause where we move out when the sell is complete as I could pay the bills but he cannot without the proceeds from the sale. \n\nThe new house is a old neighbor I had introduced him to that he now works for. The new house is a 3 bedroom that with the way we had set it up would be about 1600 a month, including utilities. Which to put in perspective is the price a low income family would be paying in the area we live in. \n\nSince then my ex has changed his mind and is giving me until the end of the month to find a place for me, my son and the 2 cats to go instead of the place we were going to stay in for a few months. I immediately went into search mode looking up every housing situation I could find while staying in the 15 mile radius of my son still being able to get the therapy I have been trying to get for over a year now. \n\nBefore his last talk with the realtor I had asked him to ask for us to be able to move out when the house was sold so that way I would have time to find a place for us to go. He refused and thats when he came back with the 30 days. Now I'm at the point where I may have to call the cops to come down and explain to him how to properly evict me so I could have some more time for my son and to not be displaced. \n\nSo WIBTAH if I called the cops on my ex?\n\nEdit: please note that I live in a county that highly values squatters rights. So regardless of weather or not I have a lease doesn't affect that.", "created_utc": 1667915168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypmoty/wibtah_if_i_called_the_cops_on_my_ex_to_properly/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
