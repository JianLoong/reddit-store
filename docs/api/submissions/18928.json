When I opened the door (glass storm door still closed and locked) I held my phone up and stared at him silently. I said nothing the entire time. He quickly got creeped out and became a little hostile. He said things like, \"Is this what you do for fun? Is it supposed to be scary? Do you not have anything better to do on a Saturday?\" I found that last one extremely ironic.

My response after the third visit in three days would be to tell every one of the company's representatives to GTFO my porch. Then I'd call the company and complain, and encourage every neighbour to call and write the company to complain. Hell, I'd write the form letter/email template. It goes beyond nuisance. Who the fuck does door-to-door at 9PM?", "NTA. Being weird isn\u2019t an act of aggression. It can sometimes be a passive deterrent to unwanted interactions or situations where the imposing party has a tendency to resist taking no for an answer. You didn\u2019t even startle them. You just creeped them out.", "Nahhh\n\nI used to do telemarketing and the perverts and weirdos who called to fuck with me livened up my day. \n\nI also used to screw with telemarketers as a kid-pretend to speak a made up language etc. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re used to it. And if this kid wasn\u2019t then he should be now.  Don\u2019t solicit door to door and expect anyone in the comfort of their home to suddenly \u201cprofessional up\u201d for you on command.", "NTA! There\u2019s no reason better way to get some peace & quiet, this is a good one.", "NTA. A friend told me this. When you got these insistent assholes, get your camera out, open the door, take this picture immediately before he knows what is going on, and tell him to get the fuck off my property. Then tell him if anything happens to my family or my property, I will call the police, tell them you threatened me and show the police your picture. Then just slam the door in his face.", "NTA, but I always feel sorry for door to door salespeople and telemarketers and try to at least not be rude. Everyone has to make a living. On the other hand, not answering the door can be dangerous, actually. Burglars go around neighborhoods ringing doorbells and then break in if no one comes to the door. A good middle-ground is to say through the door loudly, \"Not interested, no thank you.\"", "NTA and that's a pretty good way of getting rid of them. I used to get the religious door knockers frequently - scared them off pretty quickly by making out with my same-sex partner in front of them....getting rid of them + a good make out session = pretty good day for me.", "I will probably be downvoted to hell for this but...\n\nI once upon a time applied for a customer service job with ADT. I was at a place where my husband (now ex) had lost his job and we had a baby in the way. Desperate doesn't even begin to describe where I was at this point. I got the call for the interview, then a second interview and then told I was hired. Had to do a week worth of training, no big deal except it was oy $50 for the training and so far no information had been given, this was so an hour away from my home so I'd invested a lot into this job. Finally the last day of training they basically let us know we're door to door sales people and will only make money based on sales. \n\nNow in hindsight I should have been more suspicious about several things but I was 22 and naive as this was my first post-military job and I had basically no real world experience. Anyways because I was desperate and invested almost 2 weeks time I to this company at this point I decided to at least try. I quit after 2 days but I have to tell you the pressure to sell and the fact that I was spending 14 hours a day getting essentially no pay unless I made a sale (I didn't) did make talking to every person I could seem so important, and they literally told us not to take the first no as an answer (though if I was by myself I ignored this cause ew). \n\nNTA but also try and understand that these people generally aren't in these jobs because they love harassing people.

You maybe on the list.", "NTA\n\nIf one more @#$ sales person rings my doorbell, causing the dog to bark and the baby to wake up, I may try something similar. They can advertise on media and leave my home alone.\n\nThe reason they show up: home alarm systems are typically sold by commission and it's like buying a car -- the guy can sell you the product for whatever they can get. The price is not a set price. \n\nAnd depending on where you're at, the police will tell you it isn't much of a deterrent as burglars know they can be in/out in a smash-and-grab before the police arrive.", "Officially NTA, but hilariously an asshole.", "NTA  No soliciting means no soliciting :p", "Not only are you NTA, but you are a bona fide hero. Well done!", "Absolutely NTA.  I do shit like this all the time.", "NTA\n\nLike, if they're coming by multiple times a day for multiple days, they're the assholes. Also at Nine PM! That's basically bed time!", "NTA, they know they're not welcome, and meeting their treaspass with a minor prank is more than justified.", "NTA. This is hero level", "NTA", "You weren't slightly justified, you were COMPLETELY justified lol! NTA!", "NTA", ">A good middle-ground is to say through the door loudly, \"Not interested, no thank you.\"\n\nSeveral users on Nextdoor did exactly that, but the salespeople persisted.

However some of them can become extremely rude and just will not take \"no thank you\" for an answer.\n\nAt least OP found an alternative way to dissuading them from returning to their property than being flat-out aggressive or abusive", ">also try and understand that these people generally aren't in these jobs because they love harassing people. These companies aren't just predatory towards clients but towards potential employees as well.\n\nI get that. All the Vivint employees I personally saw were very young adults, and that was the observation of people on Nextdoor. Simultaneously, anyone in this field of sales knows that their presence will not be received well. We aren't in the 1960s where the internet doesn't exist. Oh, and never pay to receive training from an employer. That's a scam.", "I get what you're saying but its not like OP turned on the hose spraying and started attacking them or yelling or screaming or anything harmful.\n\nJust standing there in a mask.", "It was pretty funny tbh lol", "I love that for u", "Absolutely 1000% NTA.

They are in bed at 9pm, and usually well before.", "Everyone does not have to make a living by annoying other people.  If that's your job you need to find a new one. Why should I have to answer a door for people too ignorant to read a no soliciting sign?", ">NTA but also try and understand that these people generally aren't in these jobs because they love harassing people. These companies aren't just predatory towards clients but towards potential employees as well.\n\nWhile in principle, this is something I would ordinarily agree with. \n\nYeah, there are some desperate folks just trying to make a sale, but then there are also the die hard stalwarts who think they're living in \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\", and the only rule is ABC, Always Be Closing. Case in point: \n\nMy wife was walking in our neighborhood one nice afternoon, and unbeknownst to her, our small neighborhood was flooded with sales people for a company that did general contracting projects (Power Home Remodeling). One of them, having been told to go away by a homeowner, ran down to the walk where my wife was walking with the stroller and our 4 year old. \n\nDude kept trying to open a dialog and close a sale. Literally wouldn't get out of the way. When she finally got around this dude, she texted me to say she was on her way home, and described what happened. She rounds the corner to where we live and....**another one** started running up to her as she got closer to our house. As he attempted to follow her up the walk, still yapping on with \"oh, is this your house?\" I was waiting. \n\nI loudly told him to GTFO our property within the next 10 seconds, informed him that about 4 cops lived within a 1 block radius of us, and if he and his cohorts didn't leave my property....id be making that call. They then tried the usual \"why are you so mad, we're just doing our job\"... \n\nIf you count obstructing someone simply trying to walk as \"doing your job\", then you need your friggin head examined. \n\nAgain, context matters. I know these jobs come with a lot of pressure to close sales. That, in my view, is actually irrelevant because pressure to close a sale does not give anyone license to harass/annoy people. If you're told to leave once, then you leave. You don't come back. If you think you have that right because some low rent middle manager said so during your training...then you're an AH and an idiot. You also deserve whatever you get.", "I once made the mistake of letting religious door-knockers in to talk to me because I was very bored and stuck in the middle of a long tedious chore (and also a stupid teenager), and they kept on coming back every couple of days until eventually I had my father tell them I\u2019d died.", "Will probably be downvoted but YTA. Dudes just trying to do his job and you either humiliated and/or intimidated him. This idea that salesmen are \u201cfair game\u201d is just absurd.", "NTA. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t like it, he had the option of leaving your property. Do you have a no trespassing no soliciting sign on your property?", "Telemarketers and door to door salesmen are fair game as far as I'm concerned.  Unless it's a kid selling something delicious.", "He's lucky it was a mask and not a gun, especially at 9 o'clock at night. NTA", "NTA. Your house, your choice of how you answer the door. If he doesnt like it, he doesnt have to come back.", "NTA. I have a dog who is not aggressive but is one of those naturally intimidating breeds. I usually make sure door-to-door pests get a good look at her.", "I worked at adt for a while and the sales reps would sell incredibly complicated systems to seniors that just wanted a lifeline bracelet. It was frustrating when they would call.", "YTA, these people are just trying to make a living.  You think they want to?", "You just did the in-person version of messing with unsolicited phone callers. And he *did* say he'd stop coming to your house. Mission accomplished! NTA.", "NTA. Keep up the good work.", "My elderly mom has come to live with us, her phone and address forwarded to our home.\n\nSome of the companies that prey on old people should be glad they have no local physical office or I would appear at their door to tell management precisely what they are.
