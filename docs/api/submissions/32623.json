This year, all of them are over \u20ac100. There is no way I could afford that.\n\nIn Christmas 2021, I got all the kids cute outfits each with cartoon characters they like. They loved them but I never saw the kids wear them, and I got an earful from everyone saying my SIL was complaining.\n\nFor 2022 Christmas, I got them all lego sets each. SIL complained to me endlessly and said that she doesn't want to be picking up lego pieces every night.\n\nThis year, I'm just giving the kids Amazon gift cards so they can pick out toys that are approved by their mom. Recently my brother and SIL asked me what I'm getting the kids for Christmas and I told them that I'm giving them Amazon gift cards. My SIL said \"Well, that's not very Christmassy\" and left it at that. Tbh at the time I thought she was just making a dry joke.\n\nAnyway, now my brother is complaining to me and saying that his wife is really not happy with me because I haven't bought anything off the wish list. I told him straight it's because all the items are too expensive. He said I should've said that from the beginning instead of just ignoring it and buying gift cards. He said the kids are too young for gift cards when they can't go and buy the stuff themselves without help from the parents and I should've asked first.

You'd think Christmas gifts were a service they had ordered and paid for.", "NTA.  Your SIL is an entitled ingrate.  She can fork out the money to buy her kids the gifts she wants them to have.

It can't be news to your brother and SIL that you can't afford more on presents. His complaints seem bizarre; \"they can't buy stuff themselves w/o help from their parents.\" So?

Then I told him that it took a full day's wages at the time for me to pay for those gifts which also meant I wasn't able to feed myself because I was alone with try small children at the time and money was short.

Also helps where distance plays a factor especially when ur not around the kids to get a sense of them as individuals.  Some people use lists to maintain order or to try to ensure they dont get 3 of something they don\u2019t need extras for.", "[removed]", "My toddler has autism and loves her giant Lego like blocks.  She sorts them more than builds with them but if I build a little she joins in to help. \n\nLegos are legit one of the best toys for neurodivergent kids and neurotypical kids alike. My other kids also enjoy legos but the sets for their skill levels are pricy unless I get small ones. And there\u2019s only so much room for little buildings/figures on shelves in my house. My best friend has a whole wall with shelves of legos.", "Plus you can get it delivered straight to the recipient which is great for out of town family. No standing in queue at the shops, no trips to the post office to send it (after you finally received confirmation you have the right address) , no double postage if you ordered it online yourself, no having to find space for it in the car if travelling both yours and their cars depending on who is the ones driving (made that mistake for my eldest first christmas-forgot to leave room for the gifts he received from the in laws), no trying to fit it in the luggage if recipient is flying. \n\nOnline Christmas lists can be a lifesaver for extended families for any number of reasons AS LONG AS THE ITEMS ARE REASONABLY PRICED.", "I bought diapers for 5 of my grands one year.

I liked when my very young daughter played with loud toys--I always knew what she was doing and that she was having a good time. It was when she was quiet that I got nervous! Even now that she's a teenager I'm happy when I hear her loudly laughing or yelling or whatever upstairs on the phone (or Discord, or Twitch or whatever it is teenagers do.) She's home, she's having fun, everything is good.", "My son got a radio controlled spider one Christmas, very popular \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f", "Theres nothing wrong with that. That's the right way to do it. I'm sure you would never scoff at somebody giving a gift card or a gift they stumbled onto and thought would be great, because you have manners. I can't imagine being so rude to somebody who gave a gift.", "With christmas I know we\u2019ll be set on his diapers until his birthday in may then good til October.
