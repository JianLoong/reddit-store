This year, all of them are over \u20ac100. There is no way I could afford that.\n\nIn Christmas 2021, I got all the kids cute outfits each with cartoon characters they like. They loved them but I never saw the kids wear them, and I got an earful from everyone saying my SIL was complaining.\n\nFor 2022 Christmas, I got them all lego sets each. SIL complained to me endlessly and said that she doesn't want to be picking up lego pieces every night.\n\nThis year, I'm just giving the kids Amazon gift cards so they can pick out toys that are approved by their mom. Recently my brother and SIL asked me what I'm getting the kids for Christmas and I told them that I'm giving them Amazon gift cards. My SIL said \"Well, that's not very Christmassy\" and left it at that. Tbh at the time I thought she was just making a dry joke.\n\nAnyway, now my brother is complaining to me and saying that his wife is really not happy with me because I haven't bought anything off the wish list. I told him straight it's because all the items are too expensive. He said I should've said that from the beginning instead of just ignoring it and buying gift cards. He said the kids are too young for gift cards when they can't go and buy the stuff themselves without help from the parents and I should've asked first.

You'd think Christmas gifts were a service they had ordered and paid for.", "NTA.  Your SIL is an entitled ingrate.  She can fork out the money to buy her kids the gifts she wants them to have.

Then I told him that it took a full day's wages at the time for me to pay for those gifts which also meant I wasn't able to feed myself because I was alone with try small children at the time and money was short.

They are just acting very entitled and greedy. As a mom of 3 kids, those gifts are great gifts! The gift cards work as well because it lets them choose something their mom would approve. And they could have fun searching through the site for what they want. What mother/parent complains about getting clothes as gifts for their kids?! Especially when things add up so quickly. If they can't be thankful and grateful for the gifts you give them, then don't send any gifts anymore. If you want to do something for the kids, maybe take them out for a day out with Auntie. It doesn't have to be expensive either. Get ice cream, lunch, or go to a park. My kids make lists (even though they are older now) and if the extended family asks for the lists, I send it to them and also let them know that they don't have to get them anything, but it's always appreciated.

They aren't being kind and have a really negative narrative about this.\n\nYou're spending time and money to give to their children and I think it is worth asking why they would assume off the bat that you can spend $300.00 on their children, why would they think it was okay to complain to your family members about presents that you had got them for year, and why they think that this wouldn't be both rude and hurtful to fixate on?", "As a youngest sibling with A LOT of nibblings and no children, gift giving becomes really lop sided.

Lots of things will pop up. Again, do a handmade coupon to one of these events to take your nibblings to an event; it is a perfect gift!!
