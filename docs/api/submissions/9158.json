I (40M) have a daughter \"Sierra\" (14F) and to be honest she has always been a bit of a bully. While we have gotten along and she does well with family, when it comes to school I get called on an almost semesterly basis on the amount of bullying she does. I don't think the details are allowed here. This reached a tipping point recently when I discovered that instead of in school she would bully classmates through social media by another parent. I made her deactivate all her social media until I could see improvement in the way she treats people.\n\nShe didn't take kindly to this and yesterday(she gets home from the bus about a half hour before I get home from work) I noticed that our bird Lemon was not in her cage and it was wide open. Sierra came into the room grinning and told me I did not deserve Lemon anymore so she let her outside without a harness and shut the door on her. I was completely livid and explained to her how awful this was. Lemon is a caique that has never been in the wild, and would be unlikely to last very long if we didn't find her very soon. She said it was not her problem and that Lemon \"chose\" to run away despite just admitting to releasing her. I told her that does it: She has never taken responsibility for the way she treats others and I called her callous and that I was convinced she cares about absolutely no life but her own. When she replied with \"So?\" I told her she was grounded from everything(social media, electronics outside of what's needed for school, no friend dates and she's no longer allowed to be home alone or out of the house without my say so) Until she can finally act right.\n\nToday her grandmother on my wife's side called asking if Sierra wanted to stay the weekend over. I explained that this was not a good time for us because she was grounded. She asked why and I explained and while she offered my condolences about Lemon she said I was taking this too far and sounded abusive. We went back and forth on this for a bit and it ended in me telling her to reach out again after a few weeks and we'll see if Sierra is behaving better by then. She said I was being an ass and I hung up after that. Could I be handling this better? I just feel like I'm talking to brick walls at this point.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate the advice, and will set us up for family therapy right away. I'll admit that while the idea has crossed my mind before I think I was in denial that things were as bad as they were and that I could handle things myself. That was a big fuck up on my part.

I hope she's found.\n\n**I am not attempting to diagnose,** but your daughter seems to be displaying some traits associated with antisocial personality disorder.

She is a psycho in training! I am terrified. \n\nAlso YOU ARE THE ASS HOLE FOR RELEASING THIS PSYCHO ON SOCIETY! You are not the asshole for calling her callous. \n\nYou get called on a semesterly basis? If I could give you anti awards I'd pay 20$ for a \"you are the worst type of clueless\" award. I am so angry. You are an asshole for not institutionalizing her.", "NTA. She needs some serious help. I see you're already looking into family therapy. That sounds like a wonderful start! \n\nAlso, don't give up hope with Lemon. I lost my bird once. Try playing some bird noises on your phone and see if you can get her to call back to you. This is how I found my bird! Keep her cage outside. If she sees it and recognizes it she may come to it. Also post on social media/call shelters/post flyers. Someone might have her! I am so sorry you're going thru this. It's tough losing a bird. I hope you find her", "NTA - Your daughter needs therapy. She shows signs that if she doesn't change her ways through therapy, she's going to be on Netflix documentaries in the future. It's not a normal teenage thing what she's been doing.", "Yes. She needs a full length psychiatric evaluation, followed by longterm therapy. NTA but oof", "Or she will become a cop like many psychopaths do.", "Serious. OP is clueless. Op gets calls every semester?? WTF!!", "Yeahh, we need that girl's name. She will be certainly the next Aileen. The next time we will see her is in r/truecrime sub. Dear OP, from a mom to another: family therapy will not help. Your daughter's case is waaay more severe. She needs inpatie t\u00f4 treatment before she hurts someone.", "In this situation she doesnt need her social media, she was literally bullying people on it. I'm sure she doesn't follow her child in the bathroom or doesn't get to the point where she can't even sleep alone. This is appropriately especially when she put a family pet in danger.", "No one took away her privacy. Having social media access is not required to live a private life. Try going outside.", "The daughter is dangerous. If she has conduct disorder (essentially ASPD for the under 18 crowd), nothing will ever make her empathetic. ASPD can't be \"cured\" or \"treated\" in a conventional sense. Some people with ASPD are savvy enough to learn young that it is to their benefit to play w/in the rules. They don't actually have empathy, but they don't \"stick out\"; they have normal (sometimes even excel in high stress/\"high power\" careers). ASPD gets dangerous when the person never learned on their own (or wasn't taught by mental health clinicians) how to \"fake it\" and live w/in society,  and has impulse control issues. \n  OP's daughter is dangerous  - taking away her social media and not letting her be home alone is not \"abuse\". Right now it is a pet bird, next she could be bullying some poor kid into suicide, or would you just try to \"talk and love\" her empathy.  That isn't how it works. Some people are broken", "Long overdue. Hunh. YOU THINK??? You are an AH for letting her behave this way to people. You know why there are assholes in the world? It is because people like you let them. She is your fault. You did this to us. I remember your daughter in school, and I remember their parents. I just wish I could go back in time and harm the parents not the child.", "How?

OP indeed has a nightmare brewing in her home.", "We recently adopted a parakeet from a shelter that was found outside. They never found the owners and boy was he lucky to be found. Exotic pet birds do not typically do well outside, but it's not unheard of for them to be found and caught.\n\nOur last apartment complex had a conure that flew into someone's apartment and landed on the residents shoulder. We got a call because we also had a conure and they thought it might be ours, but this little birdy managed to fly in from several miles away, and they found the owners!\n\nThis makes me so sad, I absolutely hope Lemon is found safe and sound.", "Harming animals and thinking it's funny is a really, really bad sign of bigger problems that may be on the way", "Mental hospitals aren't for punishment and people need to stop using clinical care for mental illness as a threat  - it's disgusting. And don't try and and claim you weren't saying that because you have military school in the same sentence.", "I typed out a longer reply but this short one will do:\nIf your first instinct is to suggest admitting a troubled teenager to a \"mental hospital\" (the term is as outdated as your opinion) or a military school, you should probably see a therapist yourself.", "\u201cShould be punished by taking away all forms of communication and privacy away\u201d \n\nLmao read the fucking comment", "Award", "Hunh?

Her behaviour is incredibly alarming.", "NTA, Your daughter is showing major warning signs of conduct disorder. The lack of care for humans and animals is alarming and the harm she is doing to others (and animals) will only escalate. Get help. Notify her school, get everyone on board that is apart of her daily life and really keep a close eye on who she is communicating with, and make sure she can\u2019t put anyone or any living being in harms way again until you get professionals on board.", "NTA\n\nHonestly from how you described her, I would take your daughter to a psychiatrist. She is showing some sociopathic signs from what you have described.", "Hope your sleeping with one eye open OP.", "NTA. You have enough problems with this cruel, bullying, quite possibly sociopathic girl without having to be judged negatively by the rest of us. The problems are not likely to improve anytime soon. You need to protect yourself and anyone else you care about. Think of what she might have done to a younger child. I hope Lemon finds himself a safer home.", "OP, are you sure she let the bird out? Because there is a chance she just straight up killed the bird herself and hid the body, and it's possible she finds it funny that you have hope of finding this bird when she knows that won't happen. I'm sorry I know that is a terrible thought", "NTA\n\nAnd I want you to know, as someone who works with children, I've seen some absolutely wonderful parents, but their children... They definitely have some personality disorders or underdeveloped mentally - so please try not to be too hard on yourself. I have to tell parents this every day.\n\nI would suggest you take her to therapy because this sounds a bit sociopathic. This was a bit terrifying to read. I really hope Lemon is alright and you and your family will, too.", "That level of callous in a child is frightening", "NTA. sorry but that bird's as good as dead. it won't be able to survive in the wild and a predator will almost certainly get to it. your daughter is a huge AH for this. that's animal abuse!", "NTA that poor poor bird. She needs help badly.", "I agree with everyone here but want to add somethings. I may have missed someone saying this but I\u2019ll say it regardless. Please get her into therapy asap but both individual and family therapy. I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t found Lemon yet but keep looking. Birds are resilient and smart just like our children. \n\nNot to scare you but covering all bases, make sure she doesn\u2019t start to self harm herself or other members of your family. I would definitely talk to her guidance counselor at school, doctor & therapist about this.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting help for her but don\u2019t forget about you and the rest of the family. I wish you and your family the best.", "Oh my God. I am so sorry, this sounds so difficult. But I am very, very, very concerned for Sierra. I'm concerned there are sociopathic tendencies there and it seems you have already seen them. It sounds like you have already gotten comments and heard them and I'm glad. You sounds like a very great person with very social tendencies, and I'm really hoping with your help maybe Sierra can turn around. Please be very careful though with any vulnerable beings for the moment though. I'm sorry, you sound like a very empathetic individual, and in this situations it can be very rough.\n\nI really commend you for seeing what is going on now and taking it seriously. It's also clear to me you are a good parent. I'm sorry that others are wanting to keep in the dark about it. You are a good parent, you have been doing the best you can, and I think it amazing that you are able to listen and see what this might be and now help Sierra in the way she needs.", "NTA she needs to be committed something isn't clicking right I speak from experience, do not let her grandmother around her, she is rewarding this behavior and enabling it to spiral, she needs help.", "You need to take your child to a psychologist NOW. Not just counselling or therapy, she needs a formal assessment. NTA, I'm sorry your going through this with her.", "NTA. Please  put the birdcage outside so Lemon can get back to it.  You daughter sound like my niece,  she has form of autism, where  she know right from  wrong but only does was brings her most attention and satisfaction .", "This. She literally sentenced an animal to death. What reckless and abhorrent behaviour.\n\nDoes she not understand how disturbing that is on its own? Animal endangerment to me, screams escalation. Next thing you know she'll be beheading the neighbours dog.", "Not gonna lie, I wouldn\u2019t like for her to be at a boarding school, because that essentially sentences a bunch of other poor kids to be confined to the same space as this nasty girl, without even the ability to go home to get away from her\u2026", "I hope Lemon shows up. If it helps, when I worked with pets I had a coworker find a bird (well really the bird found her) that she loved, and she later saw signs all over for a lost bird that was clearly the bird she found. She didn't want to give the bird up because she loved her and didn't call.\n\nI tried to convince her but she was my boss and I was too young to be confident enough to do more, and I didn't know the number anyway. Definitely keep looking for Lemon, but it's okay to think the best, maybe Lemon found the nearest bird person.\n\nRegardless it's probably best to not have any animals around Sierra any time soon, and I might not until she moves out as an adult.", "Are you the kid commenting by sneaking a device? Cause it sounds like you are minimising her sociopathy to a disturbing degree. Someone who is abusive to people and animals NEEDS constant monitoring. Would you suggest at home or an institution as an alternative? OP isn\u2019t being abusive. They were completely obtuse to their daughter\u2019s level of sociopathy. We all want to believe our kids are good in their heart. However OP is 110% right in closely monitoring their kid until they can get a proper psychological evaluation.", "Maybe Lemon wasn't released.

Jfc. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything except that you straight up can\u2019t bully or punish a kid into being empathetic and caring about other peoples feelings. That\u2019s all I fucking said. Calm down.", "Oh geez. It would line up.", "Maybe... but as a bird owner i would want to at least hope that my bird is safe out there and not that he found a cruel death by my own daughter. As long as there is no proof that the birdie is dead or the daighter is a psychopath who hurt little animals, it is wrong to give up on Lemon. My opinion.", "Attitude?! It sounds like she has antisocial personality disorder, \"punishing the attitude out of her\" is going to make her more violent and sociopathic. Honestly she needs to be away from vulnerable being for now, and in psychiatric care.", "Yah, so she can grow up and participate in the obscene amounts of domestic violence associated with military culture and maybe even go on to commit suicide. That should help.", "Hahaha go on, kiddo, sit down yourself. Just stop bullying classmates and murdering pets.", "Yeah, this girl isn't my patient. She is, however, dangerous and callous. The point is that her privacy doesn't trump everyone else's safety. No one is abusing her.", "I never said her privacy trumped anything. I said that taking away her privacy (her door specifically) is abusive and bullying in and of itself. Bullying a kid in response to bullying *isn\u2019t going to work.* \n\nBut go off on your nonsense. Everyone on this sub is so hyperbolic and reactive to any counter-thought. Like I don\u2019t even think the post is real (they usually aren\u2019t) I just think it\u2019s important to point out that the commenter\u2019s idea is wrong and counterproductive. It\u2019d be fucked for other parents to think that it\u2019s okay to take away a kids privacy as punishment. Kids are people.", "Hopefully, the daughter will participate in therapy willingly. She is a minor, her parent can force her to go, but they may not be able to force her to participate. I spent thousands of dollars on therapy for my oldest, and they literally just sat there in the room, staring at the wall. They went weekly for 6 months (because I was desperate to get them help), and they didn't say a single word to the therapist. Not so much as a hello. I tried 3 different therapists at the counseling center, and they never uttered a word. I sincerely hope the daughter mentioned will participate."]}
