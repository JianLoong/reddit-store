{"id": 9158, "submission_id": "10tvc93", "title": "AITA for calling my daughter callous for releasing our bird?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I don't want the family knowing my main. I (40M) have a daughter \"Sierra\" (14F) and to be honest she has always been a bit of a bully. While we have gotten along and she does well with family, when it comes to school I get called on an almost semesterly basis on the amount of bullying she does. I don't think the details are allowed here. This reached a tipping point recently when I discovered that instead of in school she would bully classmates through social media by another parent. I made her deactivate all her social media until I could see improvement in the way she treats people.\n\nShe didn't take kindly to this and yesterday(she gets home from the bus about a half hour before I get home from work) I noticed that our bird Lemon was not in her cage and it was wide open. Sierra came into the room grinning and told me I did not deserve Lemon anymore so she let her outside without a harness and shut the door on her. I was completely livid and explained to her how awful this was. Lemon is a caique that has never been in the wild, and would be unlikely to last very long if we didn't find her very soon. She said it was not her problem and that Lemon \"chose\" to run away despite just admitting to releasing her. I told her that does it: She has never taken responsibility for the way she treats others and I called her callous and that I was convinced she cares about absolutely no life but her own. When she replied with \"So?\" I told her she was grounded from everything(social media, electronics outside of what's needed for school, no friend dates and she's no longer allowed to be home alone or out of the house without my say so) Until she can finally act right.\n\nToday her grandmother on my wife's side called asking if Sierra wanted to stay the weekend over. I explained that this was not a good time for us because she was grounded. She asked why and I explained and while she offered my condolences about Lemon she said I was taking this too far and sounded abusive. We went back and forth on this for a bit and it ended in me telling her to reach out again after a few weeks and we'll see if Sierra is behaving better by then. She said I was being an ass and I hung up after that. Could I be handling this better? I just feel like I'm talking to brick walls at this point.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate the advice, and will set us up for family therapy right away. I'll admit that while the idea has crossed my mind before I think I was in denial that things were as bad as they were and that I could handle things myself. That was a big fuck up on my part. These comments were a big wake up call that there is something very wrong with Sierra and that professional help is long overdue.", "created_utc": 1675555107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tvc93/aita_for_calling_my_daughter_callous_for/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did lemon make it home?", "NTA\n\nHarming animals and thinking it's funny is a really, really bad sign of bigger problems that may be on the way. Hope you can get your daughter some help.

Agree with other commenter, Grandma is wrong and something needs to be done; someone professional needs to intervene.\n\nThis child's lack of empathy and caring instincts is very troublesome, as is her desire to \"punish\" you by intentionally hurting or taking away something you love. \n\nThis is abusive behavior in an adult, and she needs to understand that.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is responsible for a pet's certain death. And MIL thinks you're over-reacting? You don't mention her mother, is she as much of an enabler as grandma sounds? \n\nGet that girl in intensive therapy NOW. You need a massive intervention... this callous cruelty is not to be tolerated for one more second. Don't let her have access to social media in any way, shape or form. This is serious... you should probably take her door off the hinges, because your daughter is a sneak, she's cruel, and should be punished by taking all forms of communication and privacy away. \n\nIf she can do this to a family pet, imagine what she's been doing to other kids?", "NTA.  Im with you \u2014your daughter has a cruel streak that is very disturbing.  When you held her accountable for her bad behavior, she essentially killed a pet you loved.  And excused it by saying the pet had free will.  You don\u2019t owe you\u2019re wife\u2019s mom any explanation and she was out of line downplaying your daughter\u2019s role and essentially turning the situation into a problem of yours.  I\u2019d take to family therapy to try to problem-solve.  It\u2019s OK if she refuses to attend, although adolescents usually discover that things turn out better when they have a voice. As a parent, this is a hill I\u2019d be willing to die on.  You have way more consequences to deploy if you need to.  But start with family therapy as that provides more resources and options for change, and limited current motivation on her part is less an issue than on individual, which can always be added or switched to later.", "NTA, that's really messed up.
