I would never forgive you for this. \n\nI also do not believe for one second that the vet wouldn\u2019t tell you what was wrong with your dog. That\u2019s not how the vet works. They might have needed to run more tests to be 100% certain but they would tell you what was wrong with your own fucking animal. \n\nYou and your wife talked about it but hadn\u2019t come to an agreement. There might\u2019ve been other avenues to explore before you put him down, meds or surgery. Since you claim the vet didn\u2019t know what was wrong then the vet would have run tests and been able to tell you what it was and how to treat it/if it was able to be treated. You jumped the gun on this SO BAD. \n\nIf you thought champ was that bad and needed to be put down you should have had a conversation with the vet *and your wife* and emphasized that you thought it would be better for champ.\n\nBut no.

You decided *not to try any other treatments* and essentially, just give up on him. YTA to your wife, to your kids, and also to champ. \n\nWhen I was a kid my parents had to put our family dog down.

Animals shouldn't suffer but yes, you are the asshole in this scenario.", "YTA because you\u2019re the only one who got to say goodbye and prepare for what was happening.

Because those are 2 different things. Also how old was the dog?\n\nI can understand your side.

That\u2019s not something you go behind your entire family\u2019s back and do, and that\u2019s incredibly selfish and cruel.

Some days my elderly dog had trouble getting up on her own and I had to help, but she had good days, too. And the whole, \u2018he was sick but the vet wouldn\u2019t tell us why\u2019 line sounds like bs. Had you even taken him? What was the medicine and were you giving it to him?

I hope this post isn\u2019t real.", "I mean that\u2019s something you come to a collective decision about. I know she didn\u2019t agree with you, but you don\u2019t then take the leap and put the dog down.", "What the. You put your dog down without warning your kids first.

It was a bad move to put him down without telling everyone and robbing them of the chance to say goodbye, but putting him down was the right thing to do. You just went about it wrong", "YTA so, so much.\n\nAs someone who has had family dogs, the fact that you unilaterally decided to sneak off and put the dog down is so fucked up. This will be emotionally scarring for your kids. It should have been a family decision and everyone should have got together to discuss. \n\nIf the dog did indeed need to be put down, you needed to explain that to the family.\n\nI would be so unbelievably pissed if my dad did this.", "YTA and a coward.

You can apologise to her for being the A and explain your reasons but YTA.", "YTA. There might be room for nuance in reality, but the way you describe it here is pretty bad.", "Tough decisions about quality of life and euthanasia don't make you an AH but you could have handled the aftermath much better. Your wife didn't have to be happy it was happening but she deserved to know and have a chance to say goodbye and your kids certainly didn't deserve to be kept in the dark until they started asking about their dog.", "Hi, vet tech here. \n\n1. It's not that the vet wouldn't tell you what was wrong, the vet needed more testing to tell you what is wrong. Without extensive testing a diagnosis is often harsh to establish. Radiographs and blood work can give a diagnosis for many things and is where we start to find a diagnosis, but just as often they are inconclusive. Ultrasound, catscans, exploratory surgery, MRI, biopsies are often needed for a diagnosis. \n\n2. What you did for you dog was the best ans most humane thing you could have done. Euthanasia is the greatest act of love that we can give to our sick and dying pets. Your wife is selfish for wanting your dog to suffer for her own feelings. Yoh could have handled it better, but clients like your wife who are willing to let their pets suffer instead of giving them the gift of euthanasia are the worse. \n\nESH. Your wife sucks for being selfish. You suck for your poor handling of the situation, but it doesn't sound like she gave you much choice.", "Yta - what a jerk!", "ESH\n\nHer for not acting in the dog\u2019s best interest, you for doing it without allowing them the closure of saying goodbye.", "ESH\n\nYour dog was suffering immensely and your wife was against putting him down.\n\nMaybe you should have given her the heads up that day but you put your dogs welfare above all else and that is what *you\u2019re supposed to do.*", "EHS \nAlot of people are saying YTA but aren't realizing that your wife DIDN'T want to put the dog down- here's the thing though\nAs you said yourself the dog couldn't even walk anymore which means he was SUFFERING \nAnd as hard of a action as it is you 100% Did the right thing \n\nThe ESH comes from you doing it behind her /your kids backs so they didn't even get a opportunity to say goodbye\nYou should have talked with your kids about it giving them the moment to say goodbye and afterwards taken the dog, no matter what ur wife could have said.

They would rather force the dog to suffer for no reason.", "NTA - your dog was in pain and not able to enjoy any sort of quality of life. It's a heartbreaking thing to do, but you have to do what is best for the animal in question. He was a living thing and it would have been cruel just to keep him in pain and torment because your family didn't want to lose him.", "NTA - if the vet could not do anything, Champ could not walk, he was in pain and his quality of life had gone then you gave him the final gift of letting him go peacefully.  It is far better to be a day or two early than prolong the suffering.  You see animals in obvious pain, unable to do anything, no quality of life and their people say \"I love them to much to lose them\" NOT TRUE, loving them means you help them even if it breaks your heart.", "This is such a tough one, but I'm going with NTA. I couldn't watch a dog suffer that much, and have everyone else tell me to sit there and watch it suffer. It was no doubt a super tough thing for you to do, and she compounds that by screaming at you and cussing you out.

Other people's feelings are just as real as your feelings and everyone else in the house was expected to handle theirs with a little integrity. Honestly, this is maybe divorce territory.\n\nIt's also not clear to me how bad off the dog was.

Of course, each instance is different. \n\nI lost my own dog and have seen others pass after being unable to walk. It's a horrifying sight that I wouldn't put on anyone. The post is missing the vet input that might say the husband could've waited for the family, but the dog might've passed within the next few minutes. \n\nI'm assuming OP saw how bad it was and made the sudden decision out of grief. I know it's bad to assume, but, it's an unwinnable situation. The dog could've passed when the children arrived and would've had a death full of suffering rather than quietly falling to sleep.", "Did you seek a second opinion?", "Okay. But I still don't understand how the vet wouldn't tell you what was wrong with him.", "My Madi was put down in March 2021 because her old age caught up with her very suddenly. Everyone got to say good bye to her. My oldest was in public school at the time (he is homeschooled now) and my husband called the school to have him come out and say good bye to her. We didn't keep it a secret from the kids. \n\nYTA. You don't hide this shit from your family", "Thank you asshole enthusiast", "At that point you're just making things up because you're mad at him, and assuming this must mean he's done other horrible things. Don't get me wrong, if I think she would be right not to trust him for a while and to be very upset, but divorcing and possibly fucking up your kids and throwing it all away? Not sure about that", "He could\u2019ve went to get the kids from school. My issue is that he deliberately waited until both mom and kids went to work/school and then had the dog put down. He had a plan and scheduled it behind their backs. How are the kids going to trust OOP the next time they get a pet.", "And I get the sudden illness. That\u2019s what happened with our dog. She suddenly was shaking horribly and refused to even attempt to lay down. It was like she knew if she did she\u2019d never get up but she was exhausted. At that point my kids had already taken the bus to school. I made the decision to pull them out around 10am and grab them to say their goodbyes. \n\nAnd this was 6 months after we suddenly lost their dad/my husband. Bc he died so suddenly I felt we never got to say goodbye. I was not going to let that happen again.", "It was more that they didnt know", "happy to assist", "Good thing I gave my own opinion and not yours. Everybody\u2019s threshold for trauma is different. If someone killed a member of my family without discussing it with me first and taking my choice to say goodbye away, I\u2019d do what the fuck I wanted to do in that instance.", "Did you get a second opinion? Get extensive works done?", "Did they do tests?"]}
