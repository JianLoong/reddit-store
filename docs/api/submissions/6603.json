Just hemorrhaging money with a bunch of virtual strangers when I could have gone on a trip somewhere else with people i actually want to spend my spare time and money with. It\u2019s absurd. In the last few years I\u2019ve started politely declining or saying I have a schedule conflict. The wedding and celebrations are out of control with showers, parties, rehearsals, day of costs, travel, and all the gifts along the way.
