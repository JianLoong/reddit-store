He and his ex girlfriend were both 18 when she came around, and she was definitely a little surprise.\nDespite the circumstances, my son really stepped up. He got a good job and eventually got them a nice apartment.\nThey were together for almost three years, but she just wasn't ready to be a mother, and she ran away with some other boy. She wasn't a bad girl, she just wasn't prepared to be an adult. This devistated my son, but he found his feet. My granddaughter was still very young, so she never had strong memories of her mom.\nHe's been a single father since then, and it's still a sore spot for him.\n\nYesterday my son comes by my house incredibly upset saying that his ex girlfriend came to see them. She said she was sorry for leaving like she did and just wanted to see him and her daughter. \nMy son said he told her not to come back and shut the door on her. He was practically in tears telling me this.\nI told him he needed to calm down and act like an adult about this. She wasn't asking for anything but to talk, and the least he could do was hear her out. I tried to tell him that he couldn't refuse his daughter a chance to connect with her mom, how good this could be for all of them. But he was a complete mess, he couldn't even talk to me, just stormed out. I've called, but he won't answer.\n\nI understand how hard this is for him, but this isn't some evil, malicious woman, and it sounds like she's coming from a place of real remorse. I'm was just trying to help him think clearly, but it feels like he just won't be rational here and it's starting to affect his and his daughters life.", "created_utc": 1681905782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rqx3o/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_needs_to_grow_up_a/", "score": 2814, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the same woman who abandoned your son with a child and ran away from her responsibilities. \n\n2. You don't know what she has been upto till now. She can be absolutely perfect or she can be a wreck house. Drugs, criminal activity, her previous guy these are the questions that needs to be answered before letting her to meet a child.\n\n3. Why now. Why was she absent for so long and how come she has a sudden change of heart.\n\n4. And probably the most critical. You son is scared. It may be irrational but he is not only hurt but scared that all of the this woman turns up what she wants, maybe bring hope to his child and then again abandon them or try to take the daughter.\n\n5. And last how is it going to affect the child. What are you guys gonna tell her where her mother was. Why did she never showed up in school, when she was I'll etc. \n\nYou son needs support. Step up mom/dad, he needs you to be his support. I know your intentions are good but your son needs your support.", "YTA.\n\n>He was practically in tears telling me this. I told him he needed to calm down and act like an adult about this.\n\nHas he got anyone he can go to who'll support him? You know, someone who cares about him.", "YTA. Your son and granddaughter were abandoned, and he was unexpectedly confronted by the person who abandoned them. It makes sense for him to be shaken. You're showing the person who hurt him more empathy than you're showing him and it's shitty.\n\nIt's his choice whether to engage with her or not. Your opinion on her level of remorse (when you didn't even interact with her directly and have literally no way of knowing) doesn't matter.", "Jesus Christ. \n\nIt\u2019s okay when according to you she didn\u2019t want to act like an adult and deal with her responsibilities but not when he won\u2019t act like an adult and allow her to jump back in the child\u2019s life. \n\nAnd he IS acting like an adult. Her introduction should be gradual at best before they break your grandchild\u2019s heart. \n\nBe proud of your son for stepping up and don\u2019t take the woman who walked always side.", "YTA. If she wants to see the kid she abandoned she can go through the courts. She can pay him child support and do supervised visits until baby knows her and is comfortable.", "Why does your son\u2019s ex who abandoned him and their child get more grace from you than your actual son who stepped up for his kid LIKE AN ADULT?\n\nThe appropriate response to your son in that moment was \u201cWow that must have been really distressing.\u201d You schilling him when he was having an understandable emotional response was not remotely helpful. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you pressuring your son to see and talk to the woman that abandoned him and the baby?  She was an adult, not a 14 yr old kid when she abandoned both of them and \"ran away with some other boy\"", "YTA. Seriously that was stupid advice. You want him to take back a woman who cheated on him and abandoned his daughter. Keep your mouth shut if that's the kind of advice you are gonna give.", "YTA\n\nYou were not trying to help him calm down and think clearly, you were trying to push him into talking with the deadbeat mother.\n\nIf you REALLY cared about your grand daughter and son, you\u2019d be putting them first.  A parent who left once and disappeared for FIVE YEARS has no right to just show up out of the blue and get what they want.  Protect your son and grand daughter.  You\u2019re so hyped up over getting the fairytale ending of mother and daughter reuniting that you\u2019ve become blind to reality.\n\nThink of how much anguish and pain your single-or arent son has suffered through - alone - all this time.  The hurt and resentment he likely has for the woman who nope\u2019d the fuck out of responsibility and ABANDONED her own child.  If you let that kind of person just walk right back into everyone\u2019s life, you risk your grand daughtet making memories.. just for mom to potentially disappear again once she realizes how hard parenting can be.", "Yta. Why do you have more empathy for the chick who left your son and grandchild over your own son? Be an adult and work out your issues", "YTA. If this were a man. We\u2019d be calling a spade a spade. She abandoned her kid and bf. She isnt owed anything. If she wants to be in this childs life her and your son and possibly the courts need to set that. I hope your son gets therapy so he can navigate his own trauma and advocate for his child. Coming and going from a childs life is almost worse than leaving and staying gone.", "YTA.\n\nHis ex abandoned both your son and their daughter to be *with another man.* \n\nFunny that you have no problem rolling out excuses for *her* actions and behavior and yet it seems you have little to no empathy for your son. It kinda blows my mind, to be honest. It seems to me that you're more on *her* side than his. Your son likely sees this and feels some kind of way about it, and who can blame him? First his ex betrays and abandons him and then his own *mother* sides up against him. Real nice. \n\nYour son doesn't need to grow up. That's exactly what he did from jump street. YOU, however, need to learn a thing or two about loyalty. \n\nHonestly, your son doesn't have the right to deny visitation to his ex; but, he does have the right to force the ex to go to court and petition to do so. \n\nShe can pay child support as well.", "OP needs to keep the ex-gf away. She dumped them both and now is back. She can't be trusted.", "He needed your support and not a lecture.  He could use some legal advice as well", "Yta, you have probably just destroyed whatever relationship you had with your son by sticking up for the person who not only cheated on your son but abandoned both him and your granddaughter.\n\nWhy are you so quick to defend her, are you expecting your son to get back with his ex, play happy families and act like the last 5 years didn't happen.\n\nYou say she's not a bad girl, a good girl doesn't cheat and run away with someone else, especially when they have a kid, you say she's not evil or malicious but how do you know that you don't know her anymore.\n\nI honestly don't understand how you can put her feelings before your sons, unless you've been through what his been through you have no idea how hard this is for him, with the way your defending the ex if I was your son I wouldn't trust you around my daughter alone.", "YTA.  \nThis woman didn't just leave her boyfriend/your son. She left her child. Not any custody, no visitation, just no-show for 5 years (from the little girl was 3 to now, it seems). That's not something you can just forget. She can't just decide to randomly pop up in their lives again, and you have no idea about her intentions or sincerity or remorse.\n\nWhat if she suddenly disappears from the kid's life again? How heartbreaking and devastating would that be? What if she keeps turning up and then disappearing every couple of years? Do you have any idea how much that will destroy that little girl's ability to trust other people? That's so, so much worse than being alone with a single parent who she can depend on.\n\nEven if the ex doesn't have any ill intentions, she might not realize how big the responsibility is. She might not want to hurt the child, but still end up hurting her. You son is right for protecting his daughter.\n\nIf the ex truly is remorseful, has grown up and wants to be a part of the little girl's life, then she should not just turn up unexpectedly. She should contact the father/your son first, get the court involved, prove that's she's trustworthy and then slowly introduce the daughter to her and let them have more and more visitation - on the daughter's terms and with guidance from professionals.\n\nShe can't just show up like nothing happened. And you can't just expect your son to be calm and cool about this. She abandoned him and their daughter, she hurt them deeply. Of course he can't just forgive and forget that, and of course he's afraid she's going to do the same thing again.", "YTA. He doesn\u2019t owe this woman a damn thing! She left him and her daughter 5 years ago with another guy to fend for themselves. She doesn\u2019t get to show up in his door 5 years later unannounced because she\u2019s sorry now and wants to talk! Him \u201cgrowing up & being an adult\u201d like you say has nothing to do with it. He DiD grow up and has been a great, loving single father to his child. He didn\u2019t abandon her like her mom did. He doesn\u2019t owe her anything, including to \u201chear her out\u201d. And he can refuse to allow this woman back in his daughters life! It\u2019s his job to protect her and do whats best for her! \u201cMom\u201d doesn\u2019t get to waltz back in their lives after 5 years of no contact and expect to sit and have a conversation with him. She made her bed, she\u2019s gotta lie in it! You just made this whole situation worse!! He came to you for emotional support and you berated him.\n\nEdit to add: he\u2019s needs to hire an attorney immediately! Let his attorney handle any communication she may want to have!", "YTA. You just said he was devastated, and now want him to deal with more? Try having his back and support him.", "Do I even need to add? YTA, your son stepped up and became both parents at such a young age, your son is a god damn hero compared to her. She should have been paying child support already, no question there, if she wants to reconnect then she has a colossal mountain to climb and you don't get to tell your son how to feel about that! AH.", "Aaaand what if she meets her daughter, decides to be a mother to her (she's clearly putting herself first here) plays mummy for a few weeks then all of a sudden it's just tooooo stressful and she's off again. How great will that have been for all of them? What good will that connection have been for your granddaughter? \n\nIn fact, why are you assuming that someone who left their partner and child, stayed out of touch  then just rocked up unannounced when they were bored will be offering nothing but good? Is it because she has a uterus and is, therefore, an automatically better parent than your son? \nYTA, check your prejudices a d put your grandchild's wellbeing first. Like your son does.", "I'm leaning towards YTA.\n\nYour son's ex-girlfriend is an adult who abandoned her child. She left for years.\n\nWhen you abandon a child, you don't get to just turn up as and when you please. The adult decision, at that point, is to prioritise the welfare of the child. If she wants to open a line of communication, it should be done in a public space without the child present so that everything can be discussed. I, personally, would advise your son seeks legal advice to open correct channels of communication.\n\nYou seem to be assuming a lot about this person feeling remorseful, but as someone who comes from a family where drug addiction and child abandonment runs rife, it causes so many problems that really need to be addressed and assessed.\n\nI don't really understand why your empathy in this situation seems to be pointed more at her than your son who clearly stepped up to the plate in a massive way as a single parent.\n\nEdit: I should add - If this is based in the US, I believe a court would factor in abandonment. In many states, I think it's only a year of no contact from a parent for it to class as abandonment. Legal advice is definitely what OP's son needs in this situation, as well as help to open communication channels that prioritise his child's welfare.", "YTA - He stepped up to the responsibility of being a parent, but it's ok that she did not, for reasons? She left and showed zero care despite the effort he put in. He owes her nothing and I hope he goes to court and gets full custody before she tries anything else in order to protect the daughter she abandoned.", "YTA, whether he needed to \"act like an adult\" or not, this was clearly a very sensitive moment for him and he was looking for some emotional support. You didnt need to agree with his actions but you could have at least let him work through his feelings before just berating him. I'd have stopped answering your calls for a while, too.", "There are seriously people *not* voting that YTA?! \n\nMa\u2019am, your son needed your support. This woman is a DEADBEAT and you want her to walk into their lives like nothing happened?", "Huuuge YTA\n\nYour son came to you for support when he was really upset. Not only did you tell him to basically \u201cman up\u201d, you then picked the side of the person who straight up abandoned him when he needed her most. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a bad girl?\u201d She discarded him for someone else, deserting her responsibilities, then came back *after Five Years* once she was done fooling around. It\u2019s too little too late; what that girl did to him will leave serious emotional scars. She just wants a piece of him now that he\u2019s stable. You should be slamming the door on her alongside him. What the genuine hell?", "YTA. My god the way you talk about this woman who abandoned her daughter is so damn loving I can only assume that she's the daughter you never had. She walked out. On her DAUGHTER. And you couldn't support your son when she suddenly showed back up? You had to stick up for her right then and put him down when he was already down? Let him feel what he's feeling for f\\*ck sake, then get to the business of figuring this mess out when he's had time to process. She showed up out of nowhere without notice. HE'S UPSET and rightfully so.\n\nI would have done the same thing, and at least my mother wouldn't have immediately jumped on me to defend the person who abandoned my daughter.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Don't you dare go behind his back to set up a meeting.", "YTA\n\nYour son did grow up at 18 when he had a daughter. He could have left your granddaughter with you and run off to live his wild younger years too? Would you have been so forgiving?\n\nHe needs support and for you to back him up, instead you told him to suck up his feelings and further sacrifice himself, his mental health. I get it your reasoning but it only MAY be for the good of his daughter and that remains to be seen. These things should be taken slowly and on your son's terms. The ex has no right to barge in and demand a conversation. She needs to earn her place back into her daughter's life and the only one who can allow that is your son.", "YTA She can start by paying 5 years of child support if she's actually sorry.", "YTA, she is a bad person, she abandoned her own child and being a bit immature is no excuse. Your son owes her nothing and certainly isn't obliged to risk retraumatising his kid by letting her be abandoned again.", "Oh my god YTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t trying to \u201chelp him think clearly\u201d you are trying to push your dream of a happy family. \n\nShe didn\u2019t leave for a week or two, she left for 5 years. \u201cShe isn\u2019t evil,\u201d yeah actually, she is. It\u2019s called abandonment in the court system. Abandonment is a super shitty and evil thing to do to your child. \n\nYour son has every right to his feelings. Nice invalidation there Mom. Flip the genders and this woman is a deadbeat Dad, \u201cjust wasn\u2019t ready to be a Mother\u201d is bullshit and you know it.\n\nWhy does she get off with such empathy but your son who has been the actual adult and doing all of the heavy lifting, gets rebuked?  \n\nI am willing to bet good money that her actual reason for showing up out of the blue has more to do with family pressure or a new man and how the optics of being a deadbeat parent look.", "YTA and quite sexist. If the genders were reversed you would be calling the parent that left a deadbeat. So let\u2019s call her that. She is a deadbeat mom. It\u2019s acceptable for her to leave because she wasn\u2019t ready? That\u2019s fine. She needs to stay gone and let your son be a father and she needs to pay child support. I hope he went to court and she has no rights over this child. Be a better a human, and parent. This child will not benefit from the mom coming in and out of her life.", "YTA  \nYou clearly should have handled the situation better.  \nHis ex abandoned him with their daughter. She lost her chance to step up and be a good mother. It is now your son's decision whether or not he wants her back in his life. You don't get to make that choice for him.", "YTA, \"she is not malicious\" she abandoned her child and cheated on her partner for 8 years, she is evil.", "YTA\n\nHe owes his ex nothing. She abandoned them and doesn't just get to waltz back into their lives like nothing ever happened. You have absolutely no idea if she's coming from a place of \"real remorse\". Your son is 100% within his rights to protect himself and his daughter from being hurt again by someone who clearly isn't reliable. \n\nNot sure why you feel you have to defend this woman over your son and granddaughter's best interests. You seem to have a blindspot for her. Not sure you should be the one deciding what's \"rational\" or not.", "YTA", "YTA. It wouldn\u2019t be good for your granddaughter to have her mother hopping in and out of her life. It\u2019s good that your son is looking out for her best interests.

Her just showing up at his doorstep is a hint that she may still be impulsive and unreliable.", "YTA you should be supporting your son ffs , you know the one that was there for your grandchild, he deserves all the support,  not the one who left!", "Holy shit YTA\n\nShe abandoned her child! She abandoned your son for another guy and then just tried to walk back into their lives years later without so much as a discussion?\n\nWhat a terrible mother and person you both are.", "YTA, let your son decide what's good for him and his daughter.

Staying out of it might be the wiser thing to do.", "YTA\n\nYour son is an adult and he gets to decide who he talks to, regardless of your feelings on the matter.

Can you not see how awful this is for him?? This woman left. Ran off. Turned his life - and that of a child - upside down. He will NEVER be the same again. He HAS been an adult. He stepped up when this horrible girl wouldn't. \nI'm also interested to know why you seem so forgiving of this woman?? She hurt your son. She hurt him and continues to hurt him... and you're there making excuses for her. I wonder if you'd be so kind in your words if it was your son that had up and left because he \"wasn't prepared to be an adult.\" Or if he'd left the child with you because he just wasn't ready. \nIt seems to me that you just \"aren't prepared\" to be a decent parent yourself.

This woman devastated your son and granddaughter by disappearing, and then decides to turn their world upside down again by showing up on his doorstep five years later unannounced and uninvited.  What your son needed from you was love and support while *he* figured his way through this development, not for you to force your own judgment on him.  \n\nYou failed as a parent on this one.

He got a good job and eventually got them a nice apartment.\nThey were together for almost three years, but she just wasn't ready to be a mother, and she ran away with some other boy. She wasn't a bad girl, she just wasn't prepared to be an adult. This devistated my son, but he found his feet. My granddaughter was still very young, so she never had strong memories of her mom.\nHe's been a single father since then, and it's still a sore spot for him.\n\nYesterday my son comes by my house incredibly upset saying that his ex girlfriend came to see them. She said she was sorry for leaving like she did and just wanted to see him and her daughter. \nMy son said he told her not to come back and shut the door on her. He was practically in tears telling me this.\nI told him he needed to calm down and act like an adult about this. She wasn't asking for anything but to talk, and the least he could do was hear her out. I tried to tell him that he couldn't refuse his daughter a chance to connect with her mom, how good this could be for all of them. But he was a complete mess, he couldn't even talk to me, just stormed out. I've called, but he won't answer.\n\nI understand how hard this is for him, but this isn't some evil, malicious woman, and it sounds like she's coming from a place of real remorse.

It's one thing to entertain a deadbeat mother/fathers interest in their child as far as it will go, but their relationship is fuckin dead.

He acted like an adult for a long time while the mother ran away.You should have validated his feelings and suggested a solution AFTER he calmed down. This woman made a mistake.
