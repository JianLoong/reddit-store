If you don\u2019t like her just cut her off my dude. That way you won\u2019t say mean things.", "YTA. First, thank you for making me laugh out loud because of the title. However, you are judgemental and jealous that she actually is able to deal with a long distance relationship. You put her down BECAUSE you are in a bad state of mind so you had to do it to someone else.\n\nThe way you mistreated your boyfriend shows it all; you iced him out on purpose just to one him up. She is totally right that you can't handle conflict and problems maturely.", "YTA. My husband and I met online, did long distance for a while, we have been married for 14 years now. Her relationship isnt any less valid than yours. Shitting on her isnt going to make your relationship any better.", "NTA. Your comment was mean but she was actively and openly criticising your ability to deal with a long distance relationship in the rudest way possible.", "ESH. Sorry. I completely understand your perspective- her relationship sounds shallow at best. So I can see why it\u2019d bother you. But the way you reacted to her was way inappropriate. And the fact you still keep her around despite the fact you said she sees YOU as a friend, but you don\u2019t see her the same way\u2026 thats just awful. If you know she sees you as a friend, but you don\u2019t like her, why are you inviting her to things? That just sounds like some Mean Girls bs.\n\nBut instead of voting you TA, I am also recognizing her bragging about her relationship when you\u2019re struggling with yours too is an asshole move. So you both suck here. This just all reeks of childish fighting and you both need to grow up and talk this out like the adults you are.", "NTA. You are dead on- her relationship is a FANTASY that does not exist IRL. They have never met?  In over 2 yr.  They do not deal with the real attachment and issues of an actual relationship, compromising plans, ideas, and wishes to be with a partner, etc. Online can be real.

You're a real piece of work and should focus on figuring out your own relationship before you start throwing stones in a glass house.", "YTA", "ESH. P sucks more by centering herself in a discussion that had nothing to do with her, ans carrying on as if she's superior to you and your BF.\n\nYou suck by judging her relationship as fake, cringe, and essentially otome. Sure, her self-absorption is cringe and annoying. But that doesn't make her relationship less meaningful to her.", "YTA. I cringed reading this. \n\nFirst, if you\u2019re not friends with her, why are you still leading her on and hanging out with her? You sound like someone that just hangs out with a person to only to talk badly about them later. \n\nSecond, you sound very petty. Yeah, her comment was unsolicited, but you\u2019re not gonna solve things by being standoffish with your boyfriend.", "NTA. You stood up for yourself against someone who was actively bullying you and judging your relationship. You made a comparison that made sense to her so she could understand, and it sounds like you hit a little too close to home.\n\nAnyway, if she doesn't want her relationship being judged, she shouldn't be judging other people's relationships.", "NTA. Some people have def had a hard time understanding the \u201cicing out\u201d your bf and the purpose. The only indirectly invited, egregiously early acquaintance poked at your relationship and you poked at hers. I might be an asshole myself, but you can\u2019t take a shot at someone without expecting one back.", "lmao, that\u2019s kinda hilarious. she did get what she deserved. NTA", "Well there are a lot of things to reconsider. First of all both of your relationship types are way different. They never met in person to miss each other a lot and they are satisfied just being online which is cool for them. I dont think she understands what your type of relationship to hers is different and that you are both two entirely different people. your way of being cold towards your boyfriend is excusable and something that you experienced and it's nice that you talk about it now for it to be more understanding. She did not have to but in like that and say that. I think she just wanted to brag about herself since you say that she always talks about herself so it was not a surprise. It was nice to tell her off although not the best thing to do in front of others to degrade her. So NTA for me. she had it coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They have kids or opposite schedules or long distance or whatever, and that's their relationship so I don't need it to be right for me. \n\nIf she's happy cybering a basement gamer or whatever, let her be. Also, maybe you should tell her how much you dislike her company. I would be devastated to realize someone was just putting up with me for years when I thought they were my friend - not only would I feel betrayed about the lack of actual friendship and honesty, I would feel guilty for forcing someone to waste time on me, even though it's their fault for never being open with me. \n\nI hope everything works out for you and your boyfriend, and for her and hers, but maybe you should take this time to yourself to work on your communication skills, it'll do you (and the people around you) a lot of favors in the long run", "YTA. You don't get to decide whom, besides yourself, has a \"real\" relationship or not. No matter what you're going through in your own life.", "NTA Because you wouldn\u2019t have blown your lid if P hadn\u2019t made those awful judgemental comments. She didn\u2019t like receiving what she was giving out. Yes your delivery was not the best, but you were talking about something vulnerably and she massively disrespected that with her rude and unwanted opinions.", "Except P is so extreme an asshole that op's snide comment doesn't even register.\n\nYou then went out of your way to back up P and call OP immature, when theyve been anything but.\n\nThe way you're acting you probably fuckin are P.\n\nYour opinion is not free from being criticized unless you keep it to yourself.", "I understand you being cold to your partner, but be careful it doesn\u2019t go for too long. He will still want to know he\u2019s being missed, hear about your day, etc. I spent the first year of my marriage apart from my husband due to me finishing my degree, so I appreciate you being understanding that his schooling is a priority. But make sure you give a good balance of love there as well. It\u2019s hard, but it will make things easier and help you both cope. If he feels like you keep rebuffing him, it might lead to the end of your relationship, and we don\u2019t want that. \n\nAs for your friend, be careful you aren\u2019t taking your current frustrations out in her. Have a sit down chat with her, talk it out about why her relationship isn\u2019t the same, etc. , but don\u2019t project your frustration at your BF being gone on her. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.", "NTA. My rule is don't dish it out if you can't take it. If she didn't want you to critique her relationship, she should have shut up about yours.", "I won't enter a judgement, but I will say this. I met my now husband in an online game 18 yrs ago. I had friends say to me what you said to your friend. We will be celebrating our 17 yr wedding anniversary in June 2023. Long distance is tough, really tough. But, it can work out. So can online relationships that start in an online game. \n\nHe is really a great guy, he has flaws, like I have flaws, but we are good as a team. I am so happy I ignored people telling me to dump him. He asked me to marry him, irl, while we were in game. It was awkward, and adoreable and perfect. But, we're gamers, so I loved the proposal.\n\nJust saying you may want to be more patient with your friend next time.", "NTA. Coming from someone who did have a real relationship that was long distance the whole time, you're 100% right. We video called at minimum once a week, and we did see each other in person several times, and even for us, the distance hid a lot of incompatibilities we had. It's easy to have a \"perfect relationship\" when you don't actually really interact with your significant other.", "NTA. And I don't get the yta judgements\n\n I see a lot of people that are in relationships that started long distance are upset about the beginning of your post, your judgement of P's relationship, and the fact you said you're in a \"real\" one. \n\nI read the entire post. I met my husband online and were long distance for several years. Real or not real relationship, LDRs are hard. If she's in one, she should be helping you, not judging you. We all deal with it in our own ways, and if sharing your way is as destructive and judgemental as your friend is... She deserved a wake up call. \n\nDid you maybe go a bit too far? Imo no, maybe objectively yes. But she has no business coming at you like she did, in a moment of vulnerability.", " NTA. If she shits on your relationship, you can shit on hers. Long distance is hard especially if you aren\u2019t used to it, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to point out the differences between you and her.", "OP, I am saying NTA. She came at you judgy first, you clapped back. Your friends agreed with you.", "I don't think she's saying her relationship isn't real because it started online. She's saying it's not real because they've only seen each other's faces 3 times. It could be a real relationship, but reading other comments about how her friend buys things for him and he plays lots of video games but for some reason can't video call because of his internet, kinda sounds more like a scam than a relationship. She insulted her having perfectly reasonable relationship problems when she barely interacts with her boyfriend, so of course she doesn't have problems.", "This dude is absolutely using your friend as a sugar momma to fund his LoL addiction", "You can spend a shit ton of money on league of legends. This guy can't video chat because of the internet, but has no problem playing league? She's being scammed, but that really isn't your issue if you aren't a close friend.", "Oh ho ho ho, your friend is definitely underplaying how much she paid. If you can play LOL you can definitely video chat in higher quality cams. She\u2019s being used to buy skin and in game currency which I heard a lot about because I play a lot of MOBA games and I have heard of dudes that scam people for skins and in game currencies. It can cost a lot. So people turn to low risk scamming to fuel their addiction.", "There's a lot of room in between crying mess and \"I barely even miss you\" and maybe you should start exploring that space? \n\nLike, \"I miss you a lot too and this is really hard. But I'm excited to hear about your studies/I can't tell you how much I appreciate you doing this to further your career/I know we're in this together even though we're apart and it helps.\" \n\nYou need to be honest about how you feel, but you can do that without breaking down or forcing your boyfriend to comfort you. And he needs to learn some better emotional regulation techniques as well - you have to be able to get upset sometimes without him buying a plane ticket. You can't go two years without ever having an emotional crisis.", "And video calling THREE times in 2 years. Absolutely not. That is not a real relationship, it's just not. I wouldn't be surprised if she's getting scammed or something, doesn't sound right at all.", "It just sounds like ops friend is getting catfished", "You clarified a few things in the comments so I\u2019m going to say NTA. I was going to say NAH, but P was unnecessarily rude at your party on a few fronts. However, just because her relationship is online doesn\u2019t make it less real. I\u2019d say you two should just stop being friends.", "NTA, also that Mystic Messenger thing made me laugh out loud", "NTA \n\nSure she could've handled this better, but I can see why OP would get super angry after hearing that. I would have been pissed too.", "NTA, from what I read, she tried to put you and your relationship down first and you just retaliated in an emotional moment.\n\nBut if she is so exhausting, why don\u2019t you remove her from your life? Why you still hang out?", "NTA but like, why are you still friends with this woman? You don\u2019t like her, you don\u2019t like being around her, do yourself *and* her a favor and cut it off.", "Sorry, but it's not a relationship, not even a long distance one if in three years of \"dating\" you have never, not once, met the person in real life. OP is right, it is a fantasy world P is living in. Such thing is not a relationship and some would call it a scam. So OP is definitely NTA by calling P out for voicing an opinion on something she has absolutely no idea about just to make herself sound more important, more mature and her purported relationship better.", "No one\u2019s saying there\u2019s anything wrong meeting someone online, we\u2019re calling bs because she\u2019s trying to value her relationship as more than it is. \n\nIt took 3 months of talking with my boyfriend online until we met, and we\u2019ve now been together for 5 years, you can\u2019t compare a virtual relationship to the real thing because online is easy - and the \u201cboyfriend\u201d isn\u2019t even putting any effort into it! She\u2019s video chatted with him 3 times in 2 years, they\u2019ve never met, he\u2019s made no effort to speak or interact with her friends (even in group chat) and has sketchy excuses for not being more physically active. OP\u2019s relationship is far more intimate and progressed, this is the first time they\u2019ve had to be far apart for so long and that means much more when you\u2019re waking up without your favourite person there or hugging your partner after a long day than someone\u2019s who\u2019s relationship has No experience in this and therefore doesn\u2019t know the emotional and mental impact this has on someone. P is the one not mature enough for a relationship if she\u2019s content with continuing to spend money in a virtual world for her virtual boyfriend.", "But his internet doesn't get cut off during league?! Lol", "Curious - why are you still trying to be friends with her? Even outside this one interaction, it sounds like she\u2019s not really being a friend to you at all! You\u2019re getting nothing out of this friendship. I\u2019d end it.", "Totally agree with this, OP can express missing her BF as a positive, that she loves and is proud of him. Make plans for the future to look forward to - arrange dates for when he is next home to talk about as well. Hope everything works out well for you OP, cut your friend a little slack though, NTA for telling her what you suspect is happening but she surely knows she isn\u2019t really dating this guy and is in denial? she\u2019s just a free resource (to put it delicately), the guy is likely married. I feel kind of bad for her tbh.", "Imagine texting someone for 2 years\u2026.", "YTA, why are you pretending to be friends with someone you don't like? This is cruel, just cut yourself off or distance from her since you clearly don't respect her.", "Thanks so much! I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot from the comments about why my tactic\u2019s maybe not the best. He does know I miss him, I mention that from time to time, but like I said the one time I actually showed my true feelings and cried he got a flight back and I had to basically shove him back through the airport. I\u2019m still navigating this, trying to find a good balance.\nI did have \u201cthe talk\u201d with her many times, but it\u2019s got the same ending every time - she knows he\u2019s real, they just have no money to meet and aren\u2019t in a hurry to. She also implies I couldn\u2019t possibly understand because they have a connection so much deeper than I can possibly fathom.\nThe irony of me being in an online relationship now isn\u2019t lost to me, either. So I would have appreciated some advice from her if things were different.", "Hi! I am not shitting on relationships online, that\u2019s not what makes it an imaginary relationship in my mind. Honestly it\u2019s a lot of things, but the main one is the unwillingness to try and meet up after years of knowing each other. You met him 18 years ago and married him after a year and a bit (happy for you btw). They have known each other 3, been \u201cexclusive\u201d for 2. They need 1000 euros to make the meeting happen, which might seem a lot for a broke 23 year old, but shouldn\u2019t feel insurmountable to a 29 year old.\n\n\nAgain, that was my train of thoughts. Super happy to hear that you\u2019re doing well and thanks for your comment!", "Aren\u2019t you worried that \u201cicing him out\u201d during a LDR will drive you apart? Your icing may lead to him warming up to someone else.", "Thanks so much, I really am trying! I, too, was a bit reactive at first, but most of the people commenting were civil and put things into perspective while respectful. This proved to be more of a learning experience than I thought haha.", "Respectfully, I think you need to decide whether or not you actually want to be friends with her because continually spending time with her but telling other people (especially strangers on the internet) that you don\u2019t consider her a friend and you don\u2019t actually like her - is quite mean. \n\nYour entitled to not want to be her friend but you are not entitled to continue to hang out with her but  talk down to her. \n\nOn that alone, I would say YTA - sorry. \n\nBased on what you said, your friend is a little socially awkward and possible doesn\u2019t know how to be a friend because she\u2019s never really had friend. Either talk to her about what you would like from your friendship or let her go. \n\nHope I wasn\u2019t too harsh. All the best to you and your boyfriend - hope it works out :)"]}
