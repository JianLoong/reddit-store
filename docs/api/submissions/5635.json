The dude is pushing 30, jobless and lives on another continent. I\u2019ve told her it sounds iffy every time she has asked me for my opinion, but she doesn\u2019t care for it much, so nothing really changed.

I just okay cool my way through every convo\u2026 until now.\n\nI have a (real) relationship too. We\u2019re highschool sweethearts still going strong. This year, though, he\u2019s started his Masters in another country - there\u2019s this program at his uni that allows him to study there for 2 years and then for one in our country, then he\u2019ll get a double diploma. We live in eastern Europe so like\u2026 any way out is a good way out. I have supported him like crazy but obviously 5 years of always being close to someone makes you kind of codependent. He\u2019s in a new country speaking a non-native language, with new people and customs and he\u2019s turned into an emotional timebomb.\n\nSo I tried to be a bit colder to kind of even us out? I tell him everything\u2019s fine and life\u2019s going great and I don\u2019t even miss him that much, then I hang up on him and cry myself to sleep. The one time I actually broke down on a call with him, he spent all his money on a ticket for the next week just to come and see me.

I basically told her she is playing Mystic Messenger irl and could never handle the struggles of a real relationship because she\u2019s satisfied with her cringe fantasy.

She sucks, you suck for continuing to engage with her, your boyfriend sucks for making you feel codependent for wanting to remain close over long distance. If you don\u2019t like her just cut her off my dude. That way you won\u2019t say mean things.", "YTA. First, thank you for making me laugh out loud because of the title. However, you are judgemental and jealous that she actually is able to deal with a long distance relationship. You put her down BECAUSE you are in a bad state of mind so you had to do it to someone else.\n\nThe way you mistreated your boyfriend shows it all; you iced him out on purpose just to one him up. She is totally right that you can't handle conflict and problems maturely.", "YTA. My husband and I met online, did long distance for a while, we have been married for 14 years now. Her relationship isnt any less valid than yours. Shitting on her isnt going to make your relationship any better.", "NTA. Your comment was mean but she was actively and openly criticising your ability to deal with a long distance relationship in the rudest way possible.", "ESH. Sorry. I completely understand your perspective- her relationship sounds shallow at best. So I can see why it\u2019d bother you. But the way you reacted to her was way inappropriate. And the fact you still keep her around despite the fact you said she sees YOU as a friend, but you don\u2019t see her the same way\u2026 thats just awful. If you know she sees you as a friend, but you don\u2019t like her, why are you inviting her to things? That just sounds like some Mean Girls bs.\n\nBut instead of voting you TA, I am also recognizing her bragging about her relationship when you\u2019re struggling with yours too is an asshole move. So you both suck here. This just all reeks of childish fighting and you both need to grow up and talk this out like the adults you are.", "NTA. You are dead on- her relationship is a FANTASY that does not exist IRL. They have never met?  In over 2 yr.  They do not deal with the real attachment and issues of an actual relationship, compromising plans, ideas, and wishes to be with a partner, etc. Online can be real.  But eventually you meet, and actually learn to cope with partnering. \n\nBut mostly you are NTA because:\n\nIf your friend did not want her relationship judged then she should  have kept her mouth shut about judging YOURS.", "I would say you're the AH....but only slightly and this case I think your friend needs people to be the AH.\nI think she needs some tough love.\nIt is dodgy and honestly I think as her friend you should be giving her support by questioning the relationship. So yes, I support you OP", "YTA. So not only are you openly awful to your \"real\" boyfriend as revenge.... but you belittle your friends to make yourself feel better.  You're a real piece of work and should focus on figuring out your own relationship before you start throwing stones in a glass house.", "YTA", "ESH. P sucks more by centering herself in a discussion that had nothing to do with her, ans carrying on as if she's superior to you and your BF.\n\nYou suck by judging her relationship as fake, cringe, and essentially otome. Sure, her self-absorption is cringe and annoying. But that doesn't make her relationship less meaningful to her.", "YTA. I cringed reading this. \n\nFirst, if you\u2019re not friends with her, why are you still leading her on and hanging out with her? You sound like someone that just hangs out with a person to only to talk badly about them later. \n\nSecond, you sound very petty. Yeah, her comment was unsolicited, but you\u2019re not gonna solve things by being standoffish with your boyfriend.", "NTA. You stood up for yourself against someone who was actively bullying you and judging your relationship. You made a comparison that made sense to her so she could understand, and it sounds like you hit a little too close to home.\n\nAnyway, if she doesn't want her relationship being judged, she shouldn't be judging other people's relationships.", "NTA. Some people have def had a hard time understanding the \u201cicing out\u201d your bf and the purpose. The only indirectly invited, egregiously early acquaintance poked at your relationship and you poked at hers. I might be an asshole myself, but you can\u2019t take a shot at someone without expecting one back.", "lmao, that\u2019s kinda hilarious. she did get what she deserved. NTA", "Well there are a lot of things to reconsider. First of all both of your relationship types are way different. They never met in person to miss each other a lot and they are satisfied just being online which is cool for them. I dont think she understands what your type of relationship to hers is different and that you are both two entirely different people. your way of being cold towards your boyfriend is excusable and something that you experienced and it's nice that you talk about it now for it to be more understanding. She did not have to but in like that and say that. I think she just wanted to brag about herself since you say that she always talks about herself so it was not a surprise. It was nice to tell her off although not the best thing to do in front of others to degrade her. So NTA for me. she had it coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP is NTA, and if her friend did not want unsolicited judgement, then she should have not offered her own unsolicited and unwelcome input on the OPs relationship.  No one asked her.

Also sorry that I\u2019m going to use your comment to clarify some stuff. Not trying to change your mind at all, I just feel like some stuff has been miscronstrued because I\u2019m not a native English speaker and because of the character limit.\n\nI didn\u2019t ice out my boyfriend to one up him - I did it so that he would stay there. If I were a crying mess telling him I miss him he would come home, and I know that isn\u2019t the way to go. This degree would be huge for his future, and if, unlike what we think, we aren\u2019t endgame and break up, he\u2019ll have no Masters and no girlfriend in the future.

This explains it.", "But it was ok for the friend to shit on OPs relationship, when no one asked for her opinion? If she wants to COMPARE her relationship, then she gets what she gets. \n\nAnd 2 yr without ever meeting IRL?  That stretches what can be called a relationship. Nothing wrong with meeting online, frankly we almost all do it.  But 2 yr is pretty long.  But in the end- that is not what really matters.  If you do not want unsolicited and unwelcome commentary about your relationship, do not pipe in and comment about others.", "Thanks for your judgement! I\u2019m sorry if what I said was hurtful to you in particular, this wasn\u2019t my intention by any means. I think relationships that start online are more than valid, I just don\u2019t think you can face all the problems you would in a traditional relationship through a screen. I also question the seriousness of their relationship because they really aren\u2019t actively trying to meet, and that would seem like a goal in my mind? Either way, thank you for your comment and I wish you and your husband a happy marriage and nothing but the best.", "Thanks for the comment! I _think_ she sees me as a friend because I am one of the two people she speaks to on a regular basis irl. That\u2019s just my assumption and it sounds pretty dumb now that I\u2019ve written it. I don\u2019t really know whom she considers friends because she\u2019d usually just info-dump on me and then ghost after asking how I\u2019m doing. I think that\u2019s what friends means to her though, so I\u2019ve just been accepting it. I really try to include her in stuff though, and our other common friend invited her this time because some of the people coming were highschool classmates. Either way, thanks for your judgement and I\u2019ll take it into consideration.", "I have questioned their relationship many times and at this point she just makes me come across as jealous. Until a few months ago she had never seen a picture of him, just one of him at 15. Their video calls are dodgy and I joked about her contacting Nev. He isn\u2019t working, lives with his single mother on her salary and his and P\u2019s dates consist of them playing LoL together and her buying him skins. \nI had her well-being in mind every single time and I really am sorry if I came across as hating online relationships - I\u2019m just hating on this one in particular. Thanks for your judgement though!", "well she said they are not really close but they talk I just dont know how the friend sees their friendship so i cant tell for sure", "Hey, thank you for your judgement! I might have mispoke, cause never have I been awful to my boyfriend as revenge. I know it sounds idiotic, but it\u2019s just so that he thinks I\u2019m managing well without him so that he\u2019ll focus on his studies abroad. I\u2019ve never called him names or implied rude stuff, just been less affectionate than he was accustomed to. I am going to take your advice to heart though cause you\u2019re right. Thanks!", "I\u2019m hanging out with her because she reaches out to me, we have a bit of history and I don\u2019t want people to feel lonely. There were times in my life when I had absolutely no one to listen to me, so I won\u2019t ghost a person when they wanna talk just because I\u2019m not interested in what they wanna talk about. I know for a fact she doesn\u2019t have many friends offline, so every time she reaches out I try to meet up. Why assume the kind of person I am from just one post?

Thanks for your judgement!", "Oh, I understand. In the beginning it really is tough and I hope you can both deal with this without you hurting yourself to keep him there. Hope the distance becomes easier after a while.\n\nBut still, you are frustrated with many things and kind of went after her. I understand being worried about her relationship, but you just came across as judgemental. In all honesty it feels like you are both not being very good friends to each other.", "Lmao sure, I took it personally because... I think OP calling her friend's relationship an otome game mean?\n\nIf we're going to play this game: you seem to have taken this awfully personal too. \"Deluded child\"?
