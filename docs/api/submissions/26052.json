Why wouldn't you? Your SO is your partner (hopefully) for life. You're not kids any longer.

She sounds like she's got some issues.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, the bed isn't yours alone. I personally don't see anything wrong with sleeping in the same bed, particularly if you want to relive the 'olden days'.   \nBut kicking your significant other out of your shared bed would make you a *terrible* partner and definitely the a-hole.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA lol what? Of course you chose your spouse over her.", "She can sleep in your bed, if you had her come over and let her believe she would sleep in your bed as usual. \n\nBut you have a SO and they were *home*?? LOL NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour bff is just plain weird. Totally inappropriate.", "NTA ummm, you sure your friend is just nostalgic here? \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc69 Anyway having kids and spouses is the cutoff for this type of sleepover. Sounds like she might be overwhelmed with having the kid and so much responsibility and is now yearning for the past.", "NTA\n\nYes, yes you are choosing to spend the night in bed with your S/O instead of your friend.  I'm struggling to figure out why that's controversial.\n\nI guess maybe she had the expectation that it would be like old times, but that is a her problem, not a you problem.", " You should choose your SO over your friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
