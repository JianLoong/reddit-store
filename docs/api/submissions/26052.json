Why wouldn't you? Your SO is your partner (hopefully) for life. You're not kids any longer.

She sounds like she's got some issues.", "NTA\n\nAs you said, the bed isn't yours alone. I personally don't see anything wrong with sleeping in the same bed, particularly if you want to relive the 'olden days'.   \nBut kicking your significant other out of your shared bed would make you a *terrible* partner and definitely the a-hole.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA lol what? Of course you chose your spouse over her.", "She can sleep in your bed, if you had her come over and let her believe she would sleep in your bed as usual. \n\nBut you have a SO and they were *home*?? LOL NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour bff is just plain weird. Totally inappropriate.", "NTA ummm, you sure your friend is just nostalgic here? \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc69 Anyway having kids and spouses is the cutoff for this type of sleepover. Sounds like she might be overwhelmed with having the kid and so much responsibility and is now yearning for the past.", "NTA\n\nYes, yes you are choosing to spend the night in bed with your S/O instead of your friend.  I'm struggling to figure out why that's controversial.\n\nI guess maybe she had the expectation that it would be like old times, but that is a her problem, not a you problem.", " You should choose your SO over your friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just want to make sure I have the story straight. Your SO lives with you so \u201cyour\u201d bed is actually \u201chis\u201d bed too. But your BF came over and instead of sleeping on the couch, wanted to kick him out of his own bed and take his place. Do I have that right? CRAZY!", "NTA your friend is very strange and out of line.", "NTA. Of course you're choosing your SO over her", "The sleep over isn\u2019t the problem and literally is done by most people. You have a party your hanging out it gets late and you\u2019re like hey if you want you can stay here and sleep on couch or what not really not an issue.", "NTA.  First of all, you're 24 years old, not 12.  Non-partnered, non-sexualized friends sleep in the same bed out of necessity (a scenario where there is literally only one bed), not because they choose to.\n\nSecond, yes you're choosing your s/o over her!  Wtf else are you supposed to do?  Your partner is the one committing their life to you, she isn't.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat a bullshit is this: OF COURSE you choose your s/o over her.", "NTA\n\nCertain boundaries materialise on its own after one gets married. I, being the only unmarried person left in my friends group who are all married now will never ever expect a married friend of mine to:\n1. Even invite me over for a night stay while her spouse is home that just doesn\u2019t make sense unless he is off somewhere on a work trip and she just wants to hang. Even then I would respect her need of not letting me sleep in her personal bed \n2. Even if I\u2019m visiting for a night stay while her spouse is also there for the night, I will bow out to the guest bedroom so she can unwind and close the day with her spouse on her own terms and will probably ask her to stay up a little late for me so we can talk and gossip but that\u2019s it. \n\nBoundaries are important. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA\nThat's just an unreasonable ask.  Of course your SO comes before a visitor in your home.  And absolutely it's inappropriate to kick your partner out of their own bed to replace them with somebody else,  even if it is platonic.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I have both slept on the pullout couch with friends that have visited but if my wife\u2019s friend (or my friend) tried to kick one of us out of our own bed I would show them the door so fast.", "NTA\n\nThat's so weird lmao. I could understand if your husband was out of town but it's weird af if he's there and she wants him to go sleep in another room or something...", "Omg NTA. Sounds disturbing AF.", "A get the vibe she got herself pregnant because you got pregnant.", "YTA you could have made your S/O and her S/O sleep together for 1 night, and you 2 could have had one of the funniest and fun nights for a long long time.", "Well if you\u2019re not comfortable", "Yes you are asshole for posting this question", "NTA. Things change or comes in phases in life as we get older . Give her time to deal with her perceived rejection.", "Not the AH. I agree with prioritizing your SO. She shouldn\u2019t take it so personal, long time friend or not.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nA grown adult friend was asking you to tell your significant other to sleep somewhere else because they were sleeping over\u2026\n\n\u2026and she somehow thought that was going to go down well.", "NTA. Your partner comes first in my opinion. Also, why would she want to sleep in the same bed that your partner sleeps in, sounds a little gross!", "Weird.", "NTA, it\u2019s ridiculous and immature to expect to you to kick your SO out of their town bed for your BFF can sleep there.", "NTA. \n\nYour S/O should be able to sleep in his own bed. You should be able to sleep in your bed with him, too, but in the tradition sense of a \u2018sleepover\u2019, I\u2019m used to sleeping near the person I\u2019m having a sleepover with. \n\nI would have either told her you could have a movie night, and then if she was too tired to drive home at the end, offer her a room or the couch to sleep on but set a firm line that it\u2019s not a traditional \u2018sleepover\u2019. Either that, or go full-on kid mode and build a fort in the living room and sleep out there together while your husband can sleep in your shared bed by himself. \n\nThat being said, this is kind of a blessing in disguise. She\u2019s shown how she truly feels about your relationship with her (hence the \u2018you\u2019re choosing him over me\u2019 comment) so maybe it\u2019s time to reassess the situation of your friendship, or have a conversation about it with her.", "NTA.\nAs you said yourself. It\u2018s your SO\u2018s bed, too. She\u2018s unreasonable for expecting you to basically kick your partner out of their own bed.", "Yeah sorry but I\u2019m not choosing a friend, regardless of how close we are, over someone I have a child with. And if we really are that close they would understand why I\u2019m choosing my wife and wouldn\u2019t even be mad. \n\nHer friend 100% either had ulterior motives for sleeping in bed with her (probably the reason she decided to sleep over in the first place) or as you said she has issues. NTA", "Yeah, if SO wasn't home and that side was free or it was a hotel room and no single beds available then sure yeah, share the bed but I will not kick my partner out of our bed for any reason (I can't even kick him out when he passes me off and tell him to \"sleep with the dog\" because his dog sleeps on the bed and my dog sleeps beside the bed on my side \ud83d\ude2d).", "bad bait", "Absolutely sounds like there\u2019s something going on for the friend here. I wonder if she\u2019s going through a bit of a rough time becoming a parent etc and is just longing for simpler times or something? \n\nAnyway as you rightly said OP it\u2019s your S/O\u2019s bed too. Clearly you can\u2019t kick him out so that a guest can sleep there with you. NTA", "yeah i get you im just speaking from my pov i mean no harm\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
