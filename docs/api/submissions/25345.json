They knew that she could have been hurt, felt miserable and abandoned, been in desperate situations, been struggling to survive, had suffered hardships with no family support or even died and they would be completely ignorant even though it's all their fault. Every hardship she suffered they put upon her. They are angry at you because they can't handle blaming themselves for failing her and setting her on a shitty road that ended in her early demise.

Don't beat yourself up for how this impacted them.\n\nThey are her parents who are now reacting to the result and perhaps resentment of their actions. They lost a part of themselves.

Yeah, they were awful parents to Luna and kicked her out when she needed support. They should be ashamed of themselves for the way they behaved. Their behaviour was absolutely unacceptable. \n\nBut yes, you're an arsehole for not telling them, or for not ensuring that somebody told them.

Not telling them is just cruel.", "It's sad they didn't call sooner.  When they asked, you told them.  NAH", "YTA - a humongous one at that. Not telling parents of their childs death. The fuck is wrong with you?", "YTA. \n\nBefore all the pitchforks come out, I agree with most everyone here so far.  Yes, they threw her out and it led to her having a troubled life.

We are not due unquestioned support from one another, stop telling yourself this unproductive lie.  Acceptance takes time for some and often it is too late.

The fact that nobody contacted them from either her friends or official bodies (hospital, lawyers, police etc) as next of kin is evidence of how complete the severance was. He may not have up to date contact information. He may have thought they would be trouble if they turned up at the funeral. He may have thought they just wouldn't care so why should he bother? When someone dies you inform their friends, family and loved ones. Her parents were none of these. She wasn't just no longer allowed to live rent free under their roof but was excommunicated from the family. Banished. So you don't get to say \"But they're family!\" I wouldn't have informed them.

This was one of those 'hardest things to do'  that can define us as people: to do the right thing regardless of what might happen or in spite of it *possibly* turning out bad.  He is not a better person for how things have turned out and his inactivity plays a part in that.  To do the right thing without waiting to see if someone else would have or could have. \n\nI know that a lot of the 30 and under crowd here love to fetishize vengeance and treat the complexity of relationships as a zero-sum game.  This is a lonely and childish thought process that stalls real emotional and personal growth.  The spite of denying this important talk made no one better for it.", "Sure, you're preaching to the choir.  However, treating relationships as a zero-sum game does not give anyone the chance to improve and heal.  It's unfortunate that the deceased didn't survive to hear her parents reach out for her.  To suggest they didn't deserve to know of her death is gruesome and petty.  Satisfying spite with vengeance does not make us better people.", "There are finer points to mercy that so many of you are determined to overlook because it's easier to satisfy your anger by saying \"they deserved this\".  Saying they deserved to know is no different from saying they deserved to lose her- that she deserved to die- as the punishment for their actions.  \n\nIf for no one else, inform the deceased's parents would have been a kindness *to her*.  Everyone is hung up on the possibility that they would have acted poorly as an absolute, which is ridiculous.  OPs guilt, in asking, is clear.  He is not better fit not doing the good and right thing when he could have.", "Well, I\u2019m over thirty, so thanks for the assumption there. OP was not obligated to put himself in an emotionally unsafe situation by having contact with these people, who might also very well have shown up and made a scene at the funeral. \nI\u2019m sorry for their pain now and it\u2019s hopeful that they came around.

Telling her parents wasn\u2019t your responsibility. But you know what, I don\u2019t think they were angry with you, oh sure, they may have taken it out on you, but I think they were angry with themselves. Because of their own foolishness, they missed their chance to make peace with their daughter, to tell her how much they truly loved her, and how wrong they were. And that can be a bitter pill to swallow.", "NTA. There's not a lot of hate like Christian \"love\", is there? \n\nI'm sorry about your friend.

But these are 100% the consequences of their own actions, and I would strongly suggest that their anger is a reflection not just of their grief, but of their guilt over what they did to Luna. You had every right and reason not to trust or reach out to them (I will never forget my sister trying to wash over our mum\u2019s paganism by calling a fucking priest for her funeral) and you weren\u2019t the only one. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for Luna though, that she lived and died like that, it is so very tragic and sad *hugs* \n\nAgain, NTA.", "NTA.

A betrayal like that from the people who are supposed to love you unconditionally, that is not something most people will forgive.\n\nIf anyone had the responsibilty to tell her parents, that would be her aunt.

The problem with this approach is, obviously, that you can really damage your relationship, making it unlikely or impossible to truly reconcile. And sometimes you don't get a chance to reconcile. \n\nI am sad for them, as we don't always react as we should. This is a clear case of acting in haste, and repenting at leisure. But they brought this upon themselves, and this is a direct and easily foreseen consequence of their actions.  \n\nTo your question: no, it was not your place to tell them. You had no idea they had a change of heart, and could have walked into a world of trouble had you spoken to them if they were still set in their bigoted ways. They might have made a scene at the funeral or threatened legal action.\n\nBesides, it's all moot. Your aunt was the next of kin, and directly related to the parents with far stronger connections than you had with them.

They have suffered the worst of this, having kicked out their child (their CHILD!!!!) and that hateful action being made permanent. If you can find it in yourself, perhaps you can reach out to them and talk to them about Luna's life, and what she was like in the time they did not know her, before she died.

Aunt probably knew the parents would have tried to take over the funeral and make it into something that Luna would not have wanted and so made the choice to not inform them.

That was not the question.  \n\nThe question was is OP wrong?\n\nLet's address the edit: \n\nHer next of kin informed him.  Presumably the topic of informing her parents came up, or he wouldn't have known (and been able to express) that the NoK wouldn't be informing them.  *He knew that due to bad blood between parties, that these people (right or wrong) would be intently denied the knowledge of their daughter's death.* \n\nI want you to read that last part objectively. \n\nOP questioned whether or not to do so on the knowledge that this other person would not.  By that logic, he had some means to reach out to them.  OP didn't say \"I shouldn't be blamed I had no way to reach them\".  \n\nOP knew they wouldn't be told, or wouldn't have questioned whether or not to do so. \nOP must have had the means to do so or wouldn't be expressing guilt for not doing so. \n\nThe question was not if anyone else was responsible.  The question was whether he was TA for not doing so.  If OP really knew they'd otherwise not be informed, and had the means and chose not to, he's the asshole.  I will never be convinced that acting this way made him a better person for his choice.", "Quite right! And my answer is yes.", "Do you mean sister of Luna\u2019s mother?", "Yeah sorry typo", "Emotionally unsafe, fucking spare me.  Seconds to say I'm sorry but your daughter has passed away and nothing else.   Your hypotheticals over how they might have acted is not the question. \n\nOP asked if he was wrong for not doing the right thing.  He's expressed guilt, that's answer enough. He'll have to sit with that for the rest of his life and no one is better off for it."]}
