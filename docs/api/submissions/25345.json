They knew that she could have been hurt, felt miserable and abandoned, been in desperate situations, been struggling to survive, had suffered hardships with no family support or even died and they would be completely ignorant even though it's all their fault. Every hardship she suffered they put upon her. They are angry at you because they can't handle blaming themselves for failing her and setting her on a shitty road that ended in her early demise.

Don't beat yourself up for how this impacted them.\n\nThey are her parents who are now reacting to the result and perhaps resentment of their actions. They lost a part of themselves.

Yeah, they were awful parents to Luna and kicked her out when she needed support. They should be ashamed of themselves for the way they behaved. Their behaviour was absolutely unacceptable. \n\nBut yes, you're an arsehole for not telling them, or for not ensuring that somebody told them.

It\u2019s the least anyone can do in this situation. If you were in their situation, would you not want to at least be notified?

Not telling them is just cruel.", "It's sad they didn't call sooner.  When they asked, you told them.  NAH", "YTA - a humongous one at that. Not telling parents of their childs death. The fuck is wrong with you?", "YTA. \n\nBefore all the pitchforks come out, I agree with most everyone here so far.  Yes, they threw her out and it led to her having a troubled life.

We are not due unquestioned support from one another, stop telling yourself this unproductive lie.  Acceptance takes time for some and often it is too late.  This was a tragic situation but loving your child (or parent, or anyone) doesn't mean no-strings attached. As awful as they treated her they must've still loved her to even look.

More that it just never occured to OP that he should. That this responsibility fell on him specifically. The fact that nobody contacted them from either her friends or official bodies (hospital, lawyers, police etc) as next of kin is evidence of how complete the severance was. He may not have up to date contact information. He may have thought they would be trouble if they turned up at the funeral. He may have thought they just wouldn't care so why should he bother? When someone dies you inform their friends, family and loved ones. Her parents were none of these. She wasn't just no longer allowed to live rent free under their roof but was excommunicated from the family. Banished. So you don't get to say \"But they're family!\" I wouldn't have informed them. If a friend dies I won't go out of my way to inform their school bully, cheating ex, psychotic neighbour or abusive partner. In this case though at least they had made the decision easy by cutting her out of their lives.", "He's asking if *he* was wrong for not acting when he should have, not whether or not they should know at all. His reaction, this guilt at their reaction is a sufficient answer to his question. \n\nTelling her parents would have been the morally and ethically right thing to do, regardless of who told them.  He had some of the most important information anyone can give to another person and for a minute long phone call will have this decision hanging over his shoulders for the rest of his life.  This was one of those 'hardest things to do'  that can define us as people: to do the right thing regardless of what might happen or in spite of it *possibly* turning out bad.  He is not a better person for how things have turned out and his inactivity plays a part in that.  To do the right thing without waiting to see if someone else would have or could have. \n\nI know that a lot of the 30 and under crowd here love to fetishize vengeance and treat the complexity of relationships as a zero-sum game.  This is a lonely and childish thought process that stalls real emotional and personal growth.  The spite of denying this important talk made no one better for it.", "Sure, you're preaching to the choir.  However, treating relationships as a zero-sum game does not give anyone the chance to improve and heal.  It's unfortunate that the deceased didn't survive to hear her parents reach out for her.  To suggest they didn't deserve to know of her death is gruesome and petty.  Satisfying spite with vengeance does not make us better people.", "There are finer points to mercy that so many of you are determined to overlook because it's easier to satisfy your anger by saying \"they deserved this\".  Saying they deserved to know is no different from saying they deserved to lose her- that she deserved to die- as the punishment for their actions.  \n\nIf for no one else, inform the deceased's parents would have been a kindness *to her*.  Everyone is hung up on the possibility that they would have acted poorly as an absolute, which is ridiculous.  OPs guilt, in asking, is clear.  He is not better fit not doing the good and right thing when he could have.", "Well, I\u2019m over thirty, so thanks for the assumption there. OP was not obligated to put himself in an emotionally unsafe situation by having contact with these people, who might also very well have shown up and made a scene at the funeral. \nI\u2019m sorry for their pain now and it\u2019s hopeful that they came around. But none of this is OP\u2019s fault, and he is not an asshole."]}
