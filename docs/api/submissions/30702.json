Sounds like that your consent was asked or considered. \n\n2) those \"influencers\" weren't so smart.....restaurant owners take a dim view of their customers being disturbed by a couple of fools who doesn't know how to behave appropriately.", "FYI I work in content creation and if you don\u2019t consent you don\u2019t consent. I never EVER ask to take pics that people don\u2019t want. I blur out so much. Had this been a free meal? Maybe. But you are so NTA. And any of your friends saying you should have compromised is bananas.", "You gave them two more minutes than I would have.\n\nAs soon as they asked, I would have immediately started eating my food, maintaining eye contact with them the entire time, until I was finished.\n\nNTA.", "I feel like it's OK to ask if you can take pictures, as long as you respect a \"no\", and as long as you're quick about the photos if it's a \"yes\"", "> THAT type of \"influencer\"\n\n\"I have 50,000 followers!\"\n\n\"Which means about twenty in this state and five in this city?  I could get more reach paying someone to hand out fliers in traffic.\"", "it doesnt matter since they didnt bother to ask permission in advance.\n\nOP is NTA in any case even if she told them to shove their cameras up their asses.", "To be fair I usually don't see the same people more than once in a week... If I saw you twice in one week I'd be like \"why are you here?\" (Internally) and \"Hey, twice in one week, you're keeping busy, huh?!\" (Externally)", "I've heard of barristas deliberately mis spelling names and writing badly over the SBX logo, just to ruin the image for influencers.", "*Shit, Sicadoll is talking to me again. I'm all out of topics*.\n\nSo...Hot today too eh?\n\nWhelp, look at the time. Gotta go!", "Yes! Ahaha honestly. Or they do that \"oh well yknow I could bring more revenue to your store/you can just loan it to me and if your happy with the custom then we can work something out\" or \"yous can just be my new sponsors *-lists a bunch of things I've never heard of before as previous sponsorships-*\" like ?????\n\nI love when they threaten to withhold their custom, like \"ok? I mean, I've never seen you here before, and I work for a corporate, so I'm unsure what you not shopping here is going to do...?\"\n\nEdited; missed sentence and spelling", "They were the Stauffer family.\nThey deleted their channel but their personal channels remained up from what I\u2019ve heard.", "I'm a doctor. That receptionist would have had a meeting in HR in which they were counseled on how inappropriate that was with it being clearly established that they cannot do that again and continuing will be grounds for termination.\n\nI'm not up on what all the paper trail steps are for firing people, that's literally what HR is got, but that would definitely be something they'd get in trouble for.\n\n(The only thing anyone has ever been straight up fired for at our practice was printing off a page from a patient's record with intent to take it home shown by putting it in her purse.

And they had the resources to do so, they just didn't care enough about their child to want to. No shade meant for people struggling to care for a special needs child, and not having many employment options so they legitimately have to keep up a less than ideal work situation because that's the least bad option to keep food on the table, but that was obviously not the case for these terrible people."]}
