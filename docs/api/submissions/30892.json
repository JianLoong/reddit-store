She's being absolutely childish and stupid, and this will potentially ruin your family at some point. Telling her she shouldn't have been this stupid when they're homeless and begging you for a bed won't make the money reappear. She's dangerous and, since she has never worked, she has no clue about the value of money. \n\nAs a personal advice, I'd do a clear division of what's *her* money and just take everything that is not hers away from her, or she'll just burn it.

She comes to your house & she crosses a boundary that you hold but she thinks it's silly. You tell her not to cross your boundary and she replies by criticizing your life choices. Cool? \n\nDon't use her choices to justify your actions. Either you acted appropriately or not, regardless of her non-relevant actions. Saving $ on eggs doesn't mean you're a hypocrite for spending money on travel & friends; it means you have different priorities. \n\nHer employment history is also irrelevant. Yes, she could work to enable you more egg choices, but that's not what she & dad chose. They are consenting adults who aren't hurting others. They get to make their own choices, they even get to make decisions that seem dumb to you. \n\nNext time \"oh, sorry about that, I'll be sure to check if I ever make eggs her again\" is both easy and much more relevant than \"but you just spent $120 on lunch.\" Whatboutism is tempting but in the end is irrelevant.", "YTA it's understandable to feel hurt by her pettiness and lack of generosity towards her family, call her out on that, but for you to use your parents' spending arrangement as ammunition is uncalled for. \n\n>She got defensive and suggested that I should be paying them rent while visiting. \n\n\"Ok, will stop visiting so much if it's such an inconvenience.\" Just invite your dad over to your place or your sister's instead.", "NTA for using the eggs. AH for calling out her spending in the same conversation.\n\nI would separate the 2 issues:\n1. Offer to replace the eggs and learn more about why shes upset.\n\n2. Learn more about her financial priorities right now. People have different priorities with their money and it\u2019s not your place to decide. If you\u2019re concerned about her spending, talk to her about that separately and ensure that your mom and dad are both aware and in agreement on spending decisions.", "Yta- and you have a right to be annoyed but you also probably don\u2019t have a full grasp of your parents financial situation. I\u2019m sure if things were that tight he would get her under control. Of course your dad doesn\u2019t ask her to get a job, that was their agreement. He works and she manages the house and raises the kids. Where is your mom who hasn\u2019t worked in 30 years going to get a job? I mean unless it\u2019s part time at a retail store maybe.\n\nSorry she\u2019s living it up with her friends and not buying you stuff. Ask her to go on a money daughter shopping day maybe she\u2019ll treat you. I\u2019m sure your dad has his fun too. I feel like it\u2019s just a mom thing to constantly complain about money.

The father may have financed the eggs but she supported him along the way.  Shows the disrespect towards the mother. Besides what the op has posted we have no idea of the finances of the couple but we do see how much he disregards his mother. \n.", "Based on the information we have I think it's a perfectly accurate way to phrase it. He's asked his wife to help financially by getting a job and she has continuously refused, but it is still spending money on lavish trips and food for herself- not even for the family or for outings with her husband. I don't think he would be asking her for help if he didn't need it.", "The father has never asked her to work as per original statement. \n\nWe have no idea of the financials of the husband or wife. We do know the mother hasn\u2019t worked since having kids and is now 56. What job would you have her be qualified for?\n\nI think this is a case of an entitled son who looks down on his mother. \n\nBTW I don\u2019t have fancy eggs in my fridge but I do have \u2018fancy\u2019 butter. I\u2019d be miffed if my kids came to visit, used it all up and then invalidated my worth when called out on it. \n\n\nBy fancy butter I mean the kind that actually softens so it\u2019s for toast not baking. The \u2018kids\u2019 are free to use it for toast.", "Ah you're right, I misread that. Dad didn't ask her to work. Thanks for pointing that out. \n\nI think it would be more annoying if their adult kids showed up and ate all their expensive food. OP just used expensive eggs to make breakfast for dad. Weren't the eggs meant for the parents since they're the ones who live there?"]}
