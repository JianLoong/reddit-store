I genuinely think we have a very pleasant work environment, I truly like and enjoy working with my colleagues, we have very flexible hours, unless we have an important deadline, our work is never micromanaged, we get to work from home 90% of the time, etc. But because we work as teams, I depend on my coworkers to do my job and vice-versa. If one of us is not doing the job properly, the others will be affected one way or the other. \n\nI'm placed in a team that gets along and works very well together.. with the exception of our assistant. From the moment we started working together, I cannot remember a single day he answered me right away, assisted one of us on time, and completed the simplest tasks. If we e-mailed or messaged him, he would take, at least, 2 weeks to respond - when he responded. Our clients report they rarely heard from him, when we all need to be in constant contact with them for various reasons. \n\nI lost count of how many times I had to do his job for him because someone had to, but I am only being paid for my position, not his. \n\nI tried talking to him 6 times to be exact. I told him in the nicest ways possible we needed him to be more productive and to do his job - not only because he was getting paid for that, but because his lack of professionalism was affecting all of us. It did not work. I passed it on to our supervisor, who is the kindest, most understanding professional I know. Nothing changed, so I passed it on to our manager, who gave him one last chance to get back on track and do everything that he had not done up until that point in 2 weeks. That did not work out either. \n\nWhen our feedback session came up in the beginning of this year, I was the first one (but not the only one) to say I did not want to work with him anymore. In his presence, I said I liked him as a person, but as a professional I had no respect for him whatsoever because he clearly had no consideration for any of us - his coworkers. \n\nA few weeks ago we were informed that he was fired and, now, a coworker keeps saying he was fired because I kept reporting him. I said he was fired because he was not doing his job, but she replied that the company lets a lot slide and would have kept him if it wasn't for my negative feedbacks on him, that he probably needed this job a lot - but so do we all, no?!\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1681411089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kyyet/aita_for_getting_my_coworker_fired/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I suppose that one of them is that he has to do his job. \nSo it is quite reasonable for him to get fired.\nBack to the point that you were the reason.\n\nYou first wanted to help him by contacting him.

The only reason your coworker is on his side is because you were the one picking up his slack, not her.", "NTA\n\nIt's up to him to keep his job.

But in their mind they're getting one over on the company, never mind I now have to do what they didn't.", "NTA. It took him 2 weeks to respond to a message. His lack of communication was unacceptable. Generally I believe people should just mind their own business in the workplace, but it is completely unacceptable to have to basically do someone else's job for them.", "NTA. He got himself fired by not doing his job. You didn't say anything that wasn't true. If he didn't want to lose the job, he should have performed in it. It sounds like he had MANY WARNINGS and adequate time to turn his job performance around and refused to.

But he just didn't did his work! He damaged the company. Clients complained. Co-worker didn\u2019t want to work with him. They gave him a last chance and he gave a fuck. He got himself fired. And why should all the other people do the work for someone who slacks off?

Not at all. He wasn't doing his job.  The company DID let it slide, for way too long.  You did what needed to be done.  That's all. You didn't cost him his job, he did.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe didn't need the job enough to actually do it. Needing paycheck != needing job.", "NTA. You gave appropriate feedback.

He got himself fired", "NTA, like you said, you are paid for your job not his\n\nBut i literally am curious, maybe he is having a depression and couldn\u2019t get his life in order???, nevertheless he needs to keep his professionalism.", "INFO: What is a feedback session? How were you guys put in a position where several of you were able to say you have no respect for him? Seems like an HR nightmare.", "ESH.

It puts people in a position like the one you find yourself where you are questioned if that's why someone is ultimately fired.

If you and your colleagues want to report to management individually, or collectively, that somebody is bringing the team down that's the appropriate avenue to remove all doubt about the why.
