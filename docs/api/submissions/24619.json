We had planned a vacation to a town about 800km away and decided to meet her parents at the hotel on the say of the arrival. The itinerary was for 4 days and I had booked and put down advance for everything from the hotel to the local transportation, private waterfalls and a bunch of other activities for those 4 days. \n\nMy wife's mother (58F) is morbidly obese for her height (5' 2\") and weighs about 230lbs (105kg) and she can barely walk half a step at a time. We have been telling her to reduce some weight and do some physical activity that she can do like walking, stretching and so on. Also to cut down on calorie intake as she keeps munching on snacks like chips and chocolates. The excuse she gives is that she's diabetic and would get \"dizzy\" if she doesn't eat any of those. This would turn into huge arguments, even with her husband and she would not improve her lifestyle and keep eating things. She always requires one person to be with her for \"support\" and to get in and out of cars and such. \n\nFast forward to yesterday when we had already reached the hotel and somehow while getting into their cab, she fell down on her bum and broke her hip. Rushed her to the nearest clinic to get first aid and some emergency scans which proved that she indeed broke her hip. Getting her into the ambulance was itself difficult as it took 4 people just to lift her from the ground and on to the stretcher. We couldn't get anything more than first aid at that place since it was just a small village and she needed immediate care for the broken bone. So we ditched all the plans, hired an (exorbitantly priced) ambulance, loaded her and all our luggage and travelled back to their place to admit her to a hospital. We, of course, lost most of our reservation costs, ticket costs and everything and add to that the first aid, ambulance and hospital related charges where we are waiting for a surgery. I was initially involved in getting her to a good hospital but when my wife brought up this trip and how we can plan one more when her mother is alright, i told her I'm not going anywhere with her mother until she turns her life around, reduces a bunch of weight and stops being a burden for everyone around her. She told me I'm an AH for saying this and her mother is only fat because of \"medical complications\" which are frankly BS because even the attending orthopaedic doctor told her in a subtle way that this could have been avoided if she was 20kgs lighter. I was royally pissed on losing my vacation time along with a bunch of money I had been saving up for, while also being a physical burden because we had to travel on a cramped ambulance for 12 hours on bad roads.. AITA?\n\nEdit: since a lot of people here have more weight. More context. Asian, 58F and definitely obese because at that height our average weight tends to be about half of that. Plus she has been obese for the last 15 years or so, hence a lot of joint and mobility issues", "created_utc": 1692002343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qoxe6/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_vacation_with_my/", "score": 359, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The answer is only one where it would take the same amount of people to lift a lighter person due to safety reasons/ their condition.\n\nIts heavy for a 5'2 person of course but it's not actually \"a detriment to professionals\" heavy.

Definitely NTA for not wanting to go on more adventurous trips with MiL but if your wife's family is the type to travel with each other regularly then it might have to be something to concede with (at least part of the time). I would advise your wife that while you don't mind going to some places with her mom that maybe other destinations are not appropriate for her or, at the very least, that you plan activities where it's just the two of you or a smaller group. Going back to the hiking thing: I enjoy hiking but my sister is like... a pro. 8 hour hikes up mountains in the desert sort of thing and I had no problem staying behind when I knew it would be too much for me.

It's in everyone's interest that she doesn't go on trips like the one you took. \n\n If no one will let you take a vacation you want without her, you could go somewhere and split off for the more risky stuff like waterfall hikes and be together for things like museums or shopping in town.", "NTA\n\nbut your mother in law need professional help, not only physically but emotionally (psychiatrist and psychologist) in order to be able to do that\n\nalso, four guys to pick a 105kg woman? the math isn\u2019t mathing", "YTA \n\nAccidents happen on trips.

Like my doctor has told my 5'2 ass that with my build and muscle tone he doesn't want to see me drop below 175lbs. He said at that point I would be losing muscle not fat and would end up 1) struggling to keep the that weight and 2) unhealthy. My main goal is health so that is where I will stop. According to the BMI I will be in the overweight category but BMI doesn't account for muscle mass or other factors and should be used only as a rough gauge, per my doctor.", "Exactly. I actually look fine. Yes, you can see the extra fat around my stomach and arms, etc, but at my last Dr's visit, my BP, cholesterol, blood glucose levels, everything were dangerously high! It was honestly shocking to me. And I can feel it, too. It doesn't feel good to carry all of that extra fat. I have some fun female health problems that make it hard to lose weight, but I'm trying because I don't want to have a broken body when I'm older. I'm glad you are doing well now!", "Yeah, sorry I ended up replying to yours specifically--just trying to find somewhere in this thread to put it. Everyone is just getting really wrapped up in debating the exact degree of fatness when the real issue (IMO) is bad manners and not supporting his wife.", "Not this much fat.", "If someone has been smoking for years and gets lung cancer, is it ok to blame it on smoking? Or are you going to say that you know someone who smokes and doesn't have cancer?", "OP says the doctor hinted/implied. We don't know what the doctor actually said or what interpretive spin OP is putting on it. Given that he's enraged, I'm sure his take is getting filtered through that a bit. The MIL was in an emergency situation and it seems an inopportune time for a doctor to lecture her. But who knows.", "Sure, but so what?  How long had the doctor known her, and had he any knowledge of her aside from that she came in on an emergency basis with a broken hip?  Her bones should have been stronger at her age and weight, and the fact that they were not is an issue.  Why weren't her bones stronger?  \n\nMANY doctors attribute every single problem in a woman who is overweight to her weight.  Migraines?  Lose weight.  Bronchitis after a cold?  Lose weight.  Break a finger after slamming it in a door?  Lose weight.  I this case I'd look for metabolic issues that might or might not have something to do with WHY she's overweight, but which are causing her bones to be far more fragile than they should be.", "Are you flirting with me?", "The number are facts. That isn't the argument. I was an uncontrolled diabetic, 5'2, and at my heaviest was 260 lbs. I still didn't have those kinds of mobility issues. There is something else going on. Its this idea that \"being fat is the only issue\" that leads to obese people dealing with undiagnosed illnesses because any complaint is chalked up to being obese.", "Right? He lost me at the \u201ccan\u2019t take half a step\u201d \nBeing clinically morbidly obese doesn\u2019t prevent you from being able to walk.", "She may have bone loss/ osteoporosis issues since it broke so easily.", "Fair enough. But a lot of times doctors won\u2019t even entertain the idea that something else could be wrong if you\u2019re on the heavier side of things. Op should tell his mil to get an actual check out, but it\u2019s entirely possible that she\u2019s tried and has been told \u201cshe\u2019s just fat\u201d.", "Using BMI as a reference for obesity is useless.\n\nIn his off season Arnold Schwarzenegger was obese.", "Mobility issues can cause obesity, rather than just the other way around", "FOR REAL. My doctor (she\u2019s been my regular since i was 12. I\u2019m in my mid 20s now) started calling me overweight at 150. And it was all muscle from rugby and hockey. I looked like I could bench press a horse. \ud83d\ude2d", "Just to continue to add context, I\u2019m just about the MIL\u2019s height.  In fact, about an inch taller.  At roughly 180-200lbs (it\u2019s been a few years) I wore a size 16-20 depending on the brand.  My doctor solidly considered me obese.", "Short girls are the hottest \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude09", "It feels like there\u2019s something more at hand. Like how old is she, are her bones possibly deteriorating, etc.", "Agreed", "Either you are making this up or your doctor needs to be investigated. \n\nI\u2019m a bariatric surgeon", "Your doctor needs his license revoked if that is what he said, sincerely, someone in the medical field.", "BMI is a horrible metric anyway, it takes practically nothing into account. lol at the surgeon below.", "my blood pressure was always in the normal range. But that's because when I was healthy and fit it was on the very low end of normal. It still raised significantly and if my base line wasn't so low it would have been high.\n\nDoing a lot better but still in the overweight category (only just!). Liver is better, BP is back down, cholesterol still not normal but getting close. \n\nTalked with my doctor recently and I might be going to get tested for PCOS which I'm guessing might be what you have. Since I mentioned some other things and now she wants me to get hormone tests and an ultrasound. I'm just not sure if there is any point. It doesn't sound like there is really any treatment other than manage the symptoms, which I would want to do whether I knew they were from the same cause or not.\n\nNext time I go have my \"is the weight loss working\" blood tests I will get the hormone tests but not sure if it's worth taking time off to go to hospital for an ultrasound?\n\nAnd \n\n>but I'm trying because I don't want to have a broken body when I'm older.\n\nyes this is so important!\n\n>And I can feel it, too. It doesn't feel good to carry all of that extra fat.\n\nyeah the \"you look fine\" people don't seem to understand that's not the point. This isn't a few lbs were the health impacts are neutral and it's just aesthetic preference. But also frankly even if it was surely it would be our own opinion that was the goal not theirs", "Undiagnosed problems are for doctors to solve. Not OP, nor me or you. Again, she is overweight. The whole argument was about OP being a fat shamer. Numbers and facts say he is not. He stayed her weight, height and the fact she has difficulty walking + doesn't stick to a proper menu and is diabetic. He is not a fat shamer", "Are you also nearly 60 yo? Obesity at 60 is way harder on your body than at 20-40. If she's been obese her whole adult life, then her joints are fucked.", "She is also diabetic. It's listed in the post. Thise 2 problems are enough to cause multiple health issues. I ha e no Idea why you keep arguing. I passed my judgement, make a comment to pass yours, no need for a discussion. We are just voting", "Exactly. Until a few months ago I was about the same weight at 5\u20194 and running 5k. We walked over 20Km a day at Disney right as I was starting to lose weight and I average more than 7Km of walking a day. The weight and height ratios on this don\u2019t make sense for the level of disability he is alleging unless something else is going on medically.", "If someone is obese and doesn't bother to keep up their muscles, they could start to lose the ability to walk any significant distance. 5'2\" and 200+ pounds is quite obese, 220 is morbidly so.", "It does sound like a bone problem, because the bones of fat people are generally stronger, because they carry more weight.  I broke my foot when I was heavier, and the doctor said he was surprised, because foot bones are usually strong in people who are overweight.  As it turned out, I had a problem with calcium absorption.  \n\nHip bones are usually very strong, especially in someone who is only in their 50s.  She has problems that have nothing to do with her weight.  If OP heard the doctor tell her the problem was that she weighed too much, then 1) the doctor is an asshole who needs to learn more about weight and bones and stop thinking he can diagnose people off the top of his head, especially if he's going to diagnose a break in a large strong bone as a weight issue, and 2) OP needs to stop listening only for people who agree with him.  He clearly doesn't like his MIL or people who are overweight.  That's HIS problem.  It's not clear what his MIL's medical problem is.", "I agree. I said that in an earlier comment. There are a lot of obese people that end up suffering undiagnosed because the go to answer is \"lose weight and it will get better.\" \n\nI had someone tell me that about my ADHD. I never went back.", "This sounds like exactly what OP is doing. Everything is confirmation that the problem is \"she's fat\"", "Agreed but that isn't what I wanted my argument to focus on. I get that BMI is the metric by which Reddit lives and dies so I bypassed that argument and just wanted to point out that MIL likely isn't a walking blimp. Those measurements aren't necessarily healthy but they aren't gonna get her on My 600 LB Life or anything.", "I gained a crap load of weight in basic training from PT and building muscle. I don't remember what I topped out at, but I remember being loudly berated at show time for being a fat ass and overweight at weigh in. They had to do a bunch of measurements and calculate my body fat. I was at 6%, which was low for even a dude. I was getting a period anymore because of it. Drill sergeants were mostly just reading nr because I fell under obese per weight standards but because my body fat was so low, I wasn't actually put on a diet or \"in trouble\" for being overweight.", "I am not making it up but the doctors were at a weight loss clinic. I will double check with my current GP.", "\"Someone in the medical field\", please be more specific? I know you are trying to keep it vague for privacy but the technically the greeters at the clinic door work in the medical field.  \n\nI have been told that by multiple doctors after multiple tests.", "NHSBT do not have hover jacks lying around in their popup centres pal", "You are right, a Doctor should diagnose her. Which is why OP should not have ascribed her mobility issue to her weight, as they did in the post. OP should also not have given her the advice that walking and exercise would improve her mobility, because she would lose weight. Those are things for the doctor to evaluate and prescribe. \n\nI don't know that he is a fat shamer or isn't, but if its not ok for us to diagnose her then it isn't OK for OP either or for OP to suggest treatment plans for her mobility, like losing weight.", "Then its her joints that are causing mobility problems. She should lose weight but the mobility issues while she tries to lose weight could be improved by treatment for her fucked up joints.", "She would literally have to never move her body to not be able to take half a step. It sounds like you, like OP, have no actual idea what being \u201cmorbidly\u201d obese actually feels like or does to a body. Millions of obese people are extremely active. My cousin is morbidly obese according to BMI. Same height as the MIL in this post, heavier, only a few years younger, and she walks an average of 5 - 7 miles a day, does yoga daily and travels the world.

I get that all the time with my depression", "That is infuriating. What in the hell? ADHD isn't fixed like that argh I was legit frustrated for you just reading that. There are plenty of conditions that indeed would be fixed by people losing weight, but how can any doctor worth their degree say that shit with a straight face?!", "I agree with you completely.\ni also was quite confused because if she has some muscle she is not morbidly obsese.\n\nI think is just guestimates", "Walking exercising and eating less WILL result in her losing weight and increasing her mobility. It will also help her live longer regardless of her other conditions.", "Fucked up joints (in obese people these are usually caused by obesity) will be helped by losing weight and causing less pressure on them.", "No need to apologize! I def don't expect someone to run through my comment history lol I am glad other people think the same way and the issue is recognized!", "Yeah cause if she falls a breaks a hip trying to get in a car she could definitely go to the gym and hit the racks no problem at this point. \n\nAll I have been saying is she should go to the doctor and get a treatment plan. Maybe some PT so she has a supervisor for her exercises? I mean she will get PT with a broken hip. I hope she actually puts in the work needed"]}
