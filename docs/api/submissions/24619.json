We had planned a vacation to a town about 800km away and decided to meet her parents at the hotel on the say of the arrival. The itinerary was for 4 days and I had booked and put down advance for everything from the hotel to the local transportation, private waterfalls and a bunch of other activities for those 4 days. \n\nMy wife's mother (58F) is morbidly obese for her height (5' 2\") and weighs about 230lbs (105kg) and she can barely walk half a step at a time. We have been telling her to reduce some weight and do some physical activity that she can do like walking, stretching and so on. Also to cut down on calorie intake as she keeps munching on snacks like chips and chocolates. The excuse she gives is that she's diabetic and would get \"dizzy\" if she doesn't eat any of those. This would turn into huge arguments, even with her husband and she would not improve her lifestyle and keep eating things. She always requires one person to be with her for \"support\" and to get in and out of cars and such. \n\nFast forward to yesterday when we had already reached the hotel and somehow while getting into their cab, she fell down on her bum and broke her hip. Rushed her to the nearest clinic to get first aid and some emergency scans which proved that she indeed broke her hip. Getting her into the ambulance was itself difficult as it took 4 people just to lift her from the ground and on to the stretcher. We couldn't get anything more than first aid at that place since it was just a small village and she needed immediate care for the broken bone. So we ditched all the plans, hired an (exorbitantly priced) ambulance, loaded her and all our luggage and travelled back to their place to admit her to a hospital. We, of course, lost most of our reservation costs, ticket costs and everything and add to that the first aid, ambulance and hospital related charges where we are waiting for a surgery. I was initially involved in getting her to a good hospital but when my wife brought up this trip and how we can plan one more when her mother is alright, i told her I'm not going anywhere with her mother until she turns her life around, reduces a bunch of weight and stops being a burden for everyone around her. She told me I'm an AH for saying this and her mother is only fat because of \"medical complications\" which are frankly BS because even the attending orthopaedic doctor told her in a subtle way that this could have been avoided if she was 20kgs lighter. I was royally pissed on losing my vacation time along with a bunch of money I had been saving up for, while also being a physical burden because we had to travel on a cramped ambulance for 12 hours on bad roads.. AITA?\n\nEdit: since a lot of people here have more weight. More context. Asian, 58F and definitely obese because at that height our average weight tends to be about half of that. Plus she has been obese for the last 15 years or so, hence a lot of joint and mobility issues", "created_utc": 1692002343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qoxe6/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_vacation_with_my/", "score": 2842, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The answer is only one where it would take the same amount of people to lift a lighter person due to safety reasons/ their condition.\n\nIts heavy for a 5'2 person of course but it's not actually \"a detriment to professionals\" heavy.

Definitely NTA for not wanting to go on more adventurous trips with MiL but if your wife's family is the type to travel with each other regularly then it might have to be something to concede with (at least part of the time). I would advise your wife that while you don't mind going to some places with her mom that maybe other destinations are not appropriate for her or, at the very least, that you plan activities where it's just the two of you or a smaller group. Going back to the hiking thing: I enjoy hiking but my sister is like... a pro. 8 hour hikes up mountains in the desert sort of thing and I had no problem staying behind when I knew it would be too much for me.

It's in everyone's interest that she doesn't go on trips like the one you took. \n\n If no one will let you take a vacation you want without her, you could go somewhere and split off for the more risky stuff like waterfall hikes and be together for things like museums or shopping in town.", "NTA\n\nbut your mother in law need professional help, not only physically but emotionally (psychiatrist and psychologist) in order to be able to do that\n\nalso, four guys to pick a 105kg woman? the math isn\u2019t mathing", "YTA \n\nAccidents happen on trips.

The kicker? She was barely 110 pounds.\n\nI alone could have easily picked her up and set her in the bed myself, however doing that would have caused her pain rated about 100/10 and most likely actual damage, imagine over double that weight, and actually having to lift them INTO something rather then just propping them up and sliding a wheelchair under?
