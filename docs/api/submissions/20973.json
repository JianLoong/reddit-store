It does not create an ongoing obligation for you to \"help out\" financially every time an unbudgeted expense arises in that household.\n\nHelping your mom financially while she was living alone doesn't create an obligation for you to continue contributing money to support a household that now has 3 adults.\n\nYou can and should have boundaries to protect and support your financial goals and stability. You NEED financial stability to be safe and comfortable. You might consider strengthening your boundaries about sharing information with your brother (and maybe mom) about your finances. Your income, savings and investments are none of his business.

You outlined sound reasons why it has nothing to do with you. In retrospect, you can see now how giving in to an unreasonable request set up the expectation that he could make more unreasonable requests, right?\n\nHowever before you say no to this request first check in with your mom. Is she doing okay financially? Does she need help with any expenses? Does she feel like whatever arrangements she made with your brother are adequately covering the increased costs of having more people there? I'm guessing that your brother's arrangement is free rent in return for doing things around the house that your mom hasn't been able to, and he's looking to you to defray the costs of his in-kind rent. While that's not the most ethical thing, if it was deferred maintenance that you would have gladly split last year if you'd known, then consider paying the share that you would have anyway. But only after communicating clearly to your brother the rationale. You will not be covering expenses for his housing. You are only doing this to cover a past expense of her housing.

UPDATE: NTA\n\nIs the maintenance essential, and **does** your mom have the money to pay for it? That isn't at all clear from your post.\n\nIf the reason why your brother expects you to split the cost is because the maintenance is essential (i.e. not just someone's wish list), and your mom lives in poverty and simply cannot afford it, then I think it would be fair for you to contribute at least *some* of the cost even though you don't live there. Not necessarily half, but some. Possibly a quarter (see below for the reasoning).\n\nHowever:\n\n* You haven't told us that your mom can't afford it.\n* You say \"what my brother wanted done this time was more extensive\", implying it's not essential and is a bit of a whim on his part.\n* You make a very fair point about your brother and his family living there and contributing to the wear and tear. I think that even if your mom can't afford to pay anything at all, your brother should be paying *more* than half of the cost: his family's half, plus half of your mom's half, i.e. a total of three-quarters.\n* If you were to pay half the cost, you are essentially up for maintenance costs associated with your own residence (even if you pay those costs in the form of rent to your landlord, rather than directly), plus half the cost of someone else's. Effectively, you're paying maintenance on one and a half residences. In contrast, your brother would be paying for just half of one residence. That doesn't seem fair.\n\n**Unless there's an extremely compelling reason why your mom can't pay anything at all, I'd be pushing back against this request.** It was already generous of you to pay half the cost of the dumpster when you personally had no need of it. I think your brother is demanding rather a lot, and I lean towards N-T-A. But my exact judgment would depend on any extra info you can provide.\n\nUPDATED: NTA.", "So you\u2019d help if she was alone but your brother is there and needs to do it.is your mum paying for half ? \n\nIs he paying rent?
