I would have just left though.", "I would have said \"I'm sorry, I asked if it was ok or I wouldn't have come since dog is still a puppy.\" Absolutely would've spoken up and let your friend and his wife hash it out. I would have NEVER let her think that you just sprung your puppy on them without asking, did you say anything at all?\n\nI also would've done as you did, made things quick and ended the night early. \n\nNTA, you asked!", "NTA. You asked and were given the okay. Your friend not consulting his fianc\u00e9 is on him and them not even bothering to apologize to you for a) the miscommunication and b) the inconvenience you were put through makes them total asses. The wife has every right to not want an unfamiliar dog in the house, but she still could\u2019ve said that she understood if you wanted to leave. Your friend should definitely be apologizing to you, this whole thing was his fault.", "NTA. I'm gathering from your post that the fianc\u00e9e wasn't aware of the dog coming. I'm betting your friend didn't pass it by her when he said you could bring it. That's on him, not you. \n\nHeh, imagine the conversations in that house after you left \ud83d\ude06 Bet it got pretty warm in there!", "NTA. I would have left. No gift. Just walk the dog bye and leave.", "It's understandable that you were so angry. She probably didn't come down to say bye because she too was upset with your friend. Newborns are a lot too though, so they might have been breastfeeding and resting, especially if she did the cooking and hung out for a while, in which case she must have been exhausted afterwards. So don't be upset about that, or take it personally. Your friend should have communicated that his wife wouldn't allow pets in the house. He probably knew it, but thought she'd budge after you drove all that way. I think most people would have, but anywho, you should probably talk to your friend about it. It was disrespectful of your time and money, and I feel bad for the pup. He must have been scared in there. Good thing you didn't stay the night. Sorry that happened to you guys.", "INFO: Did you at any point say something like \"I'm sorry, [Friend] told me I can bring him\"? Because fiancee sounds rude but I'm wondering if she assumed you were told to not bring the pup and did anyway, or if this was discussed between the two of them at all.\n\nAlso, did you tell your friend that the only way you can come is with the pup? Could it have come across as pushy or guilting at all?", "NTA. You communicated with your friend and got the all clear. Then drove all that way and got the riot act by the fianc\u00e9. Why didn\u2019t your friend step in? I would\u2019ve been pissed. I travel with my dog all the time and make sure to get permission to bring her. If it were me, I would\u2019ve politely excused myself and went to the nearest dog-friendly hotel. Your friend owes you an apology. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good mate imo.", "NAH. You did ask if you could bring the dog and received an affirmative answer, so obviously you thought you can bring the dog in, especially if it's cold outside. The fiance, also obviously, wasn't consulted and didn't want a dog in the house and near her little kid. Also very understandable. The only fault here lies with your friend who really should have asked the fiance before you committed to a long and expensive trip, that was really inconsiderate of him.", "NTA because you asked but I would never put the responsibility of my new pet on anyone else.

NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry that happened. Glad you and pup never have to return", "NAH. Sounds like your friend and fiancee didn't communicate properly. I see this from both sides and can't see any of you really being TA tbh.", "NAH. Sounds like miscommunication. A new baby is hard, and I can understand why you wouldn't leave your pet alone outside.", "NTA. Given this was a very dear old friend, I think you handled it as graciously as possible. Because you're good friends, why not follow up and ask if you somehow misunderstood that bringing the dog was okay. This would be his cue to start apologizing profusely for the confusion. If he doesn't, you'll need to decide whether that will be the last visit. Edit: The kicker for me is the fiancee disappearing and not bothering to say goodbye and thanks for the gift and making the trip - even if she wasn't on the same page about the dog. That was rude.", "Before I read your post, I was rolling my eyes, getting ready to call you a huge AH..however, you did everything right.  You told your friend about the predicament, and got permission to bring the dog.\n\nWith the cold/rain,  you didn't insist the dog be brought into the living area, and you made the best of it with the dog in the utility room.\n\nYou did the polite thing, ooh'ed & ahh'd at the new house & baby, but with your dog obviously upset,  you left quickly. Your friend is the one who sucks here.", "NTA, I'm assuming it's WINTER where you are located. What did they expect?", "You should have left right away!", "I wouldn\u2019t have even came inside.", "NTA - that honour goes to your friend who said you could bring the pup without checking with his fianc\u00e9e and then didn\u2019t speak up when you got there (based on your post).\n\nYou would have been fine to turn around and leave immediately.", "Doing the bare minimum for social obligation is acceptable to me in that scenario. Showing up, showing gratitude for the invite, then leaving at the extent of the welcome. Honestly, I would have let my pup sh!t in the yard and left. Your friend dropped the ball and while the invite was warming, it wasn't all on him to give permission. And it wasn't on you to accept the situation. YOU allowed your pup to be in a spot you aren't comfortable with. \nImma say NTA initially but to stick around was TA to your little buddy.", "NTA.  You handled it well.  Your friend should have warned you.  He is at fault.  I don\u2019t even blame the wife.  New house & baby and all.", ">he said it was okay to bring the pup\n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn't just show up with the dog, you asked for permission to bring him and were told that you could. I would be very upset if I asked if it was okay to bring my dog, drove several hours, and then was told the dog couldn't come in the house. Totally understandable for someone to say no, they don't want a dog in the house-- at the initial ask, before I've been told it's okay and driven all the way out there! Absolutely not okay, and you were politer than I would've been about it.", "I\u2019d have to ask your friend why he never acknowledged your previous conversation.  To me that\u2019s the weirdest part of it. Like why not say \u201cohhh Cheryl I forgot to tell you\u201d and then work out a solution? \n\nI\u2019d bring it up casually. Don\u2019t apologize. Just ask. \n\nHe was being kinda cowardly, his wife clearly couldn\u2019t have known you were bringing the pup\n\nNTA", " NTA - your friend on the other hand, wow massive AH. If this is a friendship you want to keep, I\u2019d message his wife to apologise, say you\u2019d received permission to bring pup and hadn\u2019t realised that she wasn\u2019t consulted.", "NTA, you asked and they said you could bring the dog. They're AHs for thinking it's OK to say someone can bring their pet to their house and then expect that pet to stay outside.", "NTA. You asked, they said it was okay only for you to arrive and be told to essentially abuse your pup.", "NTA they wasted your time and money when they could've just been upfront", "NTA.  Classic case of miscommunication and misunderstanding.    When \"they\" said bring the dog along they should have made it clear that the dog was welcome as long as it remained outside.   At the same time, in initially discussing this you should have clarified its a young puppy that will need to be with you all the time and not left alone outside.    But this didn't happen.  You assumed you could bring puppy inside and they assumed you could leave puppy  outside.  I think friend/fiance are AHs because while it is their house they should have apologized to you for the situation.   Personally I would have probably done about the same as you; I would also be erasing their contact details from my cellphone and crossing them off my Christmas list.", "NTA\n\nYour dear friend and his fiance communicate poorly. Sorry you and doggo were caught up in it.", "You asked, you were told yes. I am not sure what else you could have done except double down and ask if the dog is fine in the house. \nIf I am away overnight they go to the pet lodge. Usually being away means possible going out and doing things without the dog so it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry and it\u2019s often hard to make arrangements for animals you take with you in a new town because you often need their papers etc \nSo NTA but I would learn and find other arrangements nevxt time", "NTA.  Your friend is an AH for making a commitment he couldn't honor, and as a dog person, I think the fiance is an AH for not letting the dog in the house.  Do you even want to be friends with these people?", "ESH but the fianc\u00e9. She clearly wasn\u2019t consulted and I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting another person\u2019s dog in her new house. I also can\u2019t imagine a situation where it\u2019s appropriate to ask to bring your dog when invited for a new house-tour (unless it was your guide dog or something like that.)", "You need to stop bringing your dog everywhere. For real, people hate this shit. Dogs can be left alone!!! (Obvs)", "NTA. You were told you could bring the dog. I would be livid if someone told me to put my dog in a shed. I stopped going to my husband\u2019s grandma\u2019s cabin because she told me our dog could stay in the garage but his aunt and uncle\u2019s dog could stay in the house (she favors that side and treats my husband\u2019s family like dirt). I\u2019ll quick add my dog is polite and quiet! Nope! Big nope! NTA. I would have just left.", "NTA It\u2019s pretty unusual to have entirely outside dogs beyond niche situations, to the point that if you\u2019re going to agree to someone\u2019s dog visiting, you really need to specify if you\u2019re making the odd choice of disallowing them in the house. \n\nYour friend should have stood up for you. The graceful thing for the fianc\u00e9 to do would be to allow it this once because of the miscommunication - unless she\u2019s allergic or something, in which case I think keeping the dog in one or two rooms would be a good compromise - and then make her expectations clear next time.", "NTA\n\nYou asked and they said yes. Probably what happened is the person you asked assumed and didn't check with their partner. Kinda screwed their partner and yourself.", "NTA. I would have turned around and left the minute she said that. I wouldn't have locked my dog in a utility room because your friend couldn't be bothered to get on the same page with his wife ahead of time, or stick up for you when things came to a head.\n\n\"Sorry for the confusion, friend told me it was fine to bring the dog. You two clearly have some communication issues to work out so my dog and I are going to leave, along with the housewarming gift we brought you. Maybe we can try this again sometime, but probably not.\"", "NTA\n\nYour pal should have mentioned that pupper would have to stay outside when he gave permission for pupper to come visit.\n\nI'd have taken pupper and left when told they couldn't come in and were expected to stay in a shed or outside in bad weather. Not cool.", "Was prepared to say you were based on topic and first paragraph.  Especially staying the night. \nThen I read you asked permission.\n\nNTA\nYou drove quite far and did your due diligence.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 was obviously upset, but did she know you were bringing the pup?  No animals at all sounds like a rule not just for you.\nYer mate is the problem here.  Probably an accident that he forgot the rule or didn\u2019t tell the missus.  You\u2019re NTA, he is.", "Nta", "NTA. Friendship dealbreaker imo", "NTA you asked and were told yes. If the answer was yes but only if pup stays outside then they should have said that.", "YTA. As much as I hate the idea of people leaving dogs outside in the cold and rain with no indoor life, you can't take your dog to someone else's house and expect it to be let inside. Bringing your dog is one thing, but bringing your dog inside is a whole different can of worms for some people. At the end of the day it's not your house, so it's not your rules.", "Yeah, I wish I left sooner to be honest.", "Yeah, this is a clear lack of communication between the friend and his fianc\u00e9. I don't think the fianc\u00e9 is the AH either- the friend is, for not checking if the dog was actually allowed inside beforehand, and not issuing an apology for all the trouble.", "Thanks for the reply. I do wish I had left sooner.", "He definitely should\u2019ve told her. I guess he thought she would be chill about it. She wasn\u2019t.", "She\u2019s an AH for not seeing OP off after he gave a gift though", "I wish I did but it was very remote and I was hungry and needed the toilet.", "Thanks!", "Yeah, I\u2019d say it was tense!", "That\u2019s good advice, thank you. It was time and money I really didn\u2019t have.", "I agree op should have said out loud \"oh ___ told me it was ok\". If her friend didn't tell his fiancee he shoulda been called out for that and the tension/awkwardness would shift to him fairly.", "She was very rude. She just came running out to door shouting no animals in the house at me repeatedly amongst other things. No hello or welcome or anything.\nYeah, and he grew up with dogs so knows you can\u2019t just leave pups in the house for extended periods of time.", "Both a bad friend to OP and a bad fianc\u00e9 to his partner, since it sounds like he didn't check if she was onboard with letting a puppy indoors with their newborn before OP showed up.", "Thanks for your response. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t step in or say something. I would really have appreciated it and the situation was suuuper awkward.", "Presumably because friend didn\u2019t check with fianc\u00e9, which is extremely stupid. \n\nI would also not have agreed to have an untrained and unsocialised puppy around my newborn for a full overnight trip. \n\nI probably would have relented once friend turned up but from her perspective OP has been super presumptuous about bringing his dog. \n\nNTA OP, your friend is for misleading you and then not being honest about his mistake when his fianc\u00e9e thought you were being rude. \n\nHopefully he will apologise - sleep deprivation can fuck you up.", "I can see where she could be coming from. She grew up in the city and never had pets so no animal exposure.", "Yeah, I do the same.", "I wish I did, but I\u2019m not confrontational enough to make a statement like that.", "It\u2019s either this or they thought it would be fine to leave a young pup out overnight in the freezing winter rain.", "Oh, I was as mad as hell. It took every fragment of resolve in me to be as diplomatic as possible and get then get out of there as fast as I could.", "Yeah it sounds like the friend said yes and didn\u2019t tell the fianc\u00e9.", "eh if the friend said yes and didn't check with his fiancee, he's really TA. if you're going to tell someone they can bring their dog in the house and let them drive several hours to visit, you should make sure everyone in the house is going to be okay with the dog coming in before your friend starts driving over with the dog!", "I think you are correct on the communication point, only thing I can think explains the response.", "Thanks.", "It seems like OPs friend didn\u2019t tell her about the request. So there\u2019s a chance from her perspective OP turned up with his dog without asking, OP says the dog cried all the way through the visit and fianc\u00e9 is sleep deprived and probably trying to get a newborn to sleep through dog crying. She was probably extremely pissed off. \n\nIt\u2019s not on OP, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his friend wound up sleeping in the garage.", "Yeah, it was very rude. I get the whole thing about young babies being a lot of work, but all I\u2019d expect is a, \u201cthanks for coming, good bye!\u201d.", "Cheers!", "It is winter and the weather was very cold and raining heavily. It froze that night. You can\u2019t put a house pup out in that.", "Wish I did. It was such a waste of a day off.", "I\u2019m so sorry I put the pup through that, genuinely.", "I agree NTA, but dogs are animals, and having them live outside is not abuse, maybe if the dog is one of those human bred miniature breeds, but in context of the story it doesn't make sense to be the case. Why would she not allow a pug in the house?", "Thanks that a good rationale. I guess if the fianc\u00e9 had very civilly said, \u201coh, I am so sorry we didn\u2019t say the dog has to stay outside\u201d, rather than freaking out it would have not been so bad. \nAnd no, we won\u2019t be going there again any time soon.", "Yeah, I hope they communicate better than that in general.", "For something like this I would never board a dog if I didn't absolutely have to.  It's expensive, for one thing.  And in this case there was no full schedule of activities the dog was interfering with.", "Good advice.", "You might be a dog person but fianc\u00e9 might be allergic, or frightened. And an untrained, unsocialised, unknown puppy is not a good idea around a newborn baby.", "Myself and my mate go back so far and are so solid it would take more than this for me not to want to see him. The fianc\u00e9 on the other hand is someone I won\u2019t be in any rush to see for a good long time.", "Thanks for your response. I did ask, and if I didn\u2019t bring the dog with me I wouldn\u2019t have been able to visit. It may be that my friend didn\u2019t communicate this with his fianc\u00e9. I can see where she maybe coming from but I think she could have communicated her feeling with us in a more civil manner.", "I disagree. From what I\u2019ve read it sounds like OP and his friend go way back. Also, he asked to bring the pup and was told he could. I don\u2019t technically fault the fianc\u00e9 but the friend is definitely the AH.", "They literally asked", "Its a puppy and OP was staying the night.. they cleared it with their friend... OP's friend is at fault for not checking with his fiancee.", "Wow, I don\u2019t envy your dog situation. Favouritism is terrible. I think I\u2019d do the same.", "Yeah, I can understand the allergy thing. That said, my pup is naturally hypoallergenic.", "I wish I could\u2019ve done that but I am just not confrontational.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t understand why someone would ask you to do that to your pup.", "Did you just read the title? \n\nOP asked and was told they could.", "You did your due diligence by asking permission.  It's not your fault he either didn't communicate with this wife or she changed her mind on you both.\n\nI'd be prepared for the possibility of that friendship fading out, though, given his wife's reaction and/or their miscommunication issues.", "Yeah they were very disrespectful to you and to your time, and that poor pup", "If friend didn\u2019t tell her from her perspective OP has landed on her doorstep with an untrained puppy expecting to stay overnight while she has a newborn and a new house. \n\nNot to mention OP\u2019s puppy cried through the whole visit. Fianc\u00e9 is sleep deprived and trying to get a newborn to sleep through that. She was probably absolutely livid and removed herself from the situation.", "You raise a good point. I just assumed they had discussed it. I would\u2019ve done so if I was in their position.", "Ok but did you *tell her* he told you yes?\n\nBecause if I thought my partner told his friend about our no animals in the house rule and the friend came with his dog expecting to sleep over with it in the house, I'd be pissed too.\n\nThis sounds like bad communication and assumptions all around so I'm leaning ESH.", "He didn't say anything? Oh, OP, you were SO polite here. I would have been like \"I'm so sorry, Clarissa, I asked Steve if it would be okay to bring Spot and he said it was totally fine! Didn't he ask you?\"", "I get it. Sorry that you had to endure that. I\u2019m getting secondhand cringe on your behalf lol. But in all seriousness, I\u2019d chill on the friendship until he makes amends. But fair warning he may continue to put his head in the sand.", "I can understand some people might not want animals around a newborn and that\u2019s why I asked if I could bring the pup.", "In further defense of fianc\u00e9e I grew up on a farm with plenty of exposure to animals and there\u2019s not a cat\u2019s chance in hell I would have let an untrained and unsocialised puppy that was unknown to me around my newborn for an overnight trip.\n\nYour friend has made a cock up here.", "Yes, but her reaction to freaking out when she opened the door to you and your dog makes it seem like she didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be bringing it.", "Yeah, I do suspect they had an argument about it once I left.", "Great points.", "Yeah, they at TA. I'd have just gotten in my car and left", "She said no animals in the house at all. \nLetting a dog live outdoors is fine in certain conditions. My pup is an indoor dog, is a few months old and it would have been cruelty to have him stay outside in the freezing weather.", "Because she has a newborn baby and OP\u2019s puppy is not trained or socialised. \n\nThat\u2019s a potentially unsanitary animal in her house, with a newborn. Especially if dog has accidents, which is likely for so young an animal. \n\nShe can\u2019t put the baby on a mat or in a carrier, because dog is untrained and she has no idea if it will jump, lick, scratch, or bite and babies are delicate. She might not even be able to sit down with the baby in case dog jumps up. \n\nDog also cried the whole visit which could upset newborn sleep routine (bad both for development and sleep deprived parent.) \n\nAnd she might be allergic, unsure if baby is allergic, scared of dogs etc.\n\nOP is NTA but anyone enforcing a boundary like that with a newborn isn\u2019t either. Friend is the AH for saying yes to untrained puppy coming for overnight trip and then seemingly not communicating with his fianc\u00e9. I\u2019d bet she does most of the childcare and night feeds too. No wonder she was pissed off and rude by the end of the visit.", "Exactly this. It was miscommunication.\n\nBut I get the feeling that your friend didn't consult with the fiance.\n\nIf you're close friend with this buddy of you're, it might be good to just call and chit chat. You can \"apologize\" for the miscommunication and say that you didn't mean to offend the fiance with the dog. Its kind of a bait Convo starter to see what your friend will say, if your friend is sorry, he'll interrupt and apologize also - and hopefully clarify on what happened. This would clarify if it was a misunderstanding (with them thinking it's backyard), or your friend not informing the fiance. You can also educate your friend that in general, when people ask permission to bring their dog, it's implied for indoors - so your firne should I form whomever that the dog would only be allowed outside.\n\nYou're definitely NTA. Your friend is.", "I think there\u2019s a common sense element that tells you new parents would prefer not to have an untrained puppy that\u2019s unknown to them overnight with their newborn baby. \n\nIn this case OP asked and his friend cocked up. But a newborn is absolutely equivalent to a \u201cfull schedule of activities the dog was interfering with\u201d, unless the dog was well-trained and known to the parents.", "NTA, but in response to your question, I would have done the same, stayed a short time, met the child, left.  I think you played that right.", "Couldn't you find a dog sitter or something? Or were you out of options?", "Yeah, we go back a few decades.", "Again I didn\u2019t make a judgment", "I don\u2019t bring my dog everywhere.\nI did clear it with my friend and explain it to my predicament. \nAnd no, you can\u2019t leave puppies alone for extended periods of time. It\u2019s irresponsible.", "If only they made places that pup (we don\u2019t know the age) could stay at overnight where they would be taken care of \ud83e\udd14. And note I didn\u2019t give a verdict. Just making generalizations", "Yeah, I asked, explained my predicament.", "OP was told they could bring the dog. They don't seem to have been told that meant they could bring the dog inside, seems like an assumption.", "Little fella cried constantly. We could hear him throughout the house, just added to the awkwardness.", "That\u2019s a pretty fair assessment.", "OPs puppy probably cried through the whole visit because it was scared and cold. If it were inside with OP it would\u2019ve been less likely to be crying.", "Or was taking care of or feeding the newborn. It\u2019s around the clock care, even more intense than taking care of a puppy. She did everyone a favor by being scarce.", "Either way don't feel bad about it though, that's on him! Sucks about the gas money though.", "It\u2019s not too late to talk to him about it. \u201cHey friend, when you said I could bring my dog I assumed it would be ok. It didn\u2019t seem like you and fiance were on the same page about that though. I was disappointed I had to cut my time short because of the situation. Can I ask what happened?\u201d", "I don't know, I think it's on the friend to communicate with his wife and I wouldn't necessarily want to contribute to a fight between them by saying \"friend said it was ok.\" OP may also not have had a real opportunity to do so. NTA.", "Thanks. Yeah, I\u2019ll be chilling on it for sure.", "Yeah exactly you\u2019re not in the wrong. Your friend is for not checking with his fianc\u00e9 over something so important, and also not clarifying that it was mistake when you turned up and became upset.", "Okay then, it's a literal puppy. The fact that she didn't jump on the opportunity to play with a puppy should be a red flag for your friend tho.", "Wouldn't you bring a crate in a situation like that -- untrained puppy in someone's new house? That might have helped the entire situation.", "Cheers, I would like to raise it with him\u2026 when I have calmed down.", "All the usual people that would sit were away.", "Not making a judgement doesn't stop people from replying and disagreeing so i don't know why you're bothering to point that out.", "I know, I'm just disagreeing with your ill-thought out opinion", "There was no need to board the dog when the friend was happy to have it as far as OP knew. You can't magic a boarding kennel out of nowhere when thr goalposts change after you arrive.", "Im with you OP. They said the dog was welcome. Theres no ambiguity there.", "Wait, so they DID originally say you could bring the dog inside? If so, that changes everything.", "I think if that was the case, the response would\u2019ve been, \u201cyou can bring the dog but it\u2019ll have to stay outside.\u201d", "It's a rational assumption the dog would be welcome inside.", "\u2026what in the?! \n\n\u201cYou can bring your dog\u201d means you can bring your dog. It doesnt mean you can lock your dog up outside. Thats inhumane.", "that would be my last trip..", "That would be friendship ending to me", "Puppy was in the utility room so not cold but obviously has separation anxiety. I wonder how that would have worked overnight, unless OP was planning on letting his dog share his bed. \n\nThat aside, you let it in the living area and it instead might have jumped up at the baby, or had an accident in the house, and OPs friends would have had to put their newborn\u2019s mats and other things babies have very commonly on the floor away because dogs literally roll in piss and shit and it\u2019s unsanitary for a very vulnerable baby. \n\nThat\u2019s not even touching on small facts like there might be a dog allergy, or friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 might be scared of dogs. \n\nIt\u2019s very normal and acceptable for people to have boundaries in their own spaces with dogs. Doubly so when you have a newborn baby and you don\u2019t know the dog, and it\u2019s clearly too young to be properly trained and likely to get overexcited and overstimulated meeting this new kind of human. \n\nOP asked, so NTA. Fianc\u00e9 has every right not to want a puppy in her space and to be angry when it seems that a guest has violated her boundary. The only candidate for AH here is the friend who misled OP and his wife and didn\u2019t have the grace to own up.", "I'd call the friend and ask 'Wtf happened? You said it was fine.'", "It means you literally have nothing to disagree with. I made generalizations", "People should not be asking to bring their dogs everywhere they go in general. It puts people in awkward situations having to say no. Yet again in didn\u2019t post a verdict so no need to argue w me", "Yes, it would have been great to get that response because I would have then said, \u201cokay, in that case I can\u2019t make it this time, I\u2019ll have make the trip another time\u201d.", "I agree, it's inhumane, but \"you can bring your dog\" =/= \"your dog is welcome inside\"", "I would never have stepped foot in the house.", "No. You gave your opinion.", "But youre commenting, that doesn\u2019t absolve you from people disagreeing with you.", "I think we\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree here and it looks like most people commenting also disagree with you.", "Can I bring my husband? \nSure! \n<arrives with husband>\nYour husband has to sit in the shed.", "This is so funny!!"]}
