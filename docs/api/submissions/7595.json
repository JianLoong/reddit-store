For the past week he has been eating with me, and it has been awesome, and he sleeps better too. However, my wife was furious when she saw me put cinnamon in the sweet potatoes. She said it wasn't safe for the baby and I should never have done that without consulting her.\n\nI explained that I did research, but she said that didn't matter, because mother's instincts are more important. I asked what about my instincts, and she said I didn't have any. She said moms instinctually know what is good for there babies.

She says straight up, \"it tastes better when it's yours.\" EVEN IF WE'RE EATING THE SAME FOOD.\n\nYour baby is going to be fine, but you're going to be boxing your own child for your bowl of ramen some day, I'm just saying.", "Just ask the doctor infrount of your wife if it is okay. But for sure the mom knows best is bs.", "So the fact that he is going to grow up liking food and being a non-picky eater ia just a pleasant side effect.", "That's awesome, my babies were the same. They hated baby food because it wasn't what was on our plate.", "Hey just wanted to tell you I probably wouldn\u2019t have an aversion disorder to food(at least in part) if my parents did this. So mild spices are ok for babies. Do it.", "Spices and new flavors are recommended for baby.\n\nMine loved nutmeg, butter and cinnamon in pumpkin.\n\nHave fun teaching your baby to love food!\n\nNTA", "That sounds similar to what my parents did. They would just take whatever food they were eating that day and run my portion through a food processor so it didn't need chewing.", "Literally just posted exactly this and then read your comment.  Spot on.", "Well your breast milk will be flavored by whatever you eat, so if you\u2019re breastfeeding and curry is your daily meal, then your baby will eat spicy sooner than most.  Formula fed can be slightly pickier at the start, but also a lot of that is temperament.  If your baby is stubborn and picky, it won\u2019t matter what their 0-6 months intake was, they\u2019ll fight you anyway.", "The super bland food yo start out with helps test for allergies. Narrowing down an allergy is a lot easy if there are like 1 to 10 ingredients vs 30+", "The OP is the child\u2019s PATERNAL PARENT.  good grief.", "Good thing a parent was in control of the situation then.", "True.  And the parent knows that the baby likes spices.", "Lazy dinner tonight included, grapes, strawberries, peas, corn, and chicken nuggets. He thoroughly enjoyed making the peas into finger hats!\n\nEnjoy your little! It goes by way too fast.", "We give them to him deconstructed, so he got shredded chicken, shredded cheese, and some sour cream. You could toast up some corn tortillas and cut them in strips and give them to him. However you eat them, just taken apart so he can grab with his hands. \n\nI also recommend you check out r/babyledweaning for more ideas! His second favorite is scrambled eggs.", "Ya I got a 1.5 year old who loves spicy chips. She just loves them", "You know what? [You are right](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4646750/)! Cinnamon was something I remember being cautioned about specifically, but that was over a decade ago. Turns out the pediatric recommendations have changed since I had a baby. Wow!", "The doctor usually gives you a list of foods to introduce with appropriate ages. Our pediatrician stressed introducing one food at a time to determine allergies.", "Though by this point, anything he's already eaten without a reaction is likely fine, right?", ">I suggest that you make your portion with spices and your baby's food without the extra ingredients.\n\nOP has done this. Sweet potato and carrots without additions.\n\nAdd cinammon. No problem.\n\nAdd garlic powder. No problem.\n\nOP, you are doing nothing wrong. NTA.", "This response is spot on. Also things like giving the yolk and egg whites separately in order to figure out if they are allergic to one or the other. Once we figured that out, my kids were pretty much eating everything we were by the time they were year and half.", "You need to change your top level comment so your vote counts.", "i pretty much said the same thing and i'm downvoted -35, even though they clearly say in this group to NOT downvote.", "Ha! That's hilarious. I can see it now, me confidently holding my plate up in the air, smug grin slowly melting off my face as he goes through a growth spurt in high school. What fun.", "Sandwiches and eggs and bagels my dad makes for himself 150% taste better than ones I make myself or even ones he makes for me!! Lol", "As someone in their 40s, it still tastes better! XD But I do love sharing my food- especially new stuff- with my now not-so-little kiddo.  They have very few dislikes and curried food is one of their favorites.", ">Mine loved nutmeg\n\nThat is not recommended for babies. It can be toxic, and can cause hallucinations.", "That subreddit looks awesome! I've got to show my wife.", "> We don't have enough information to make that judgement.\n\nI mean, yeah we do: \"I explained that I did research, but she said that didn't matter, because mother's instincts are more important. I asked what about my instincts, and she said I didn't have any.\"\n\nDoes that sound like someone who's planning to run her \"instincts\" past the person she claims has none?", "I have literally watched my pediatrician Google answers to questions like that in front of me. If you can find a good source, I don\u2019t think skipping the phone call is a huge deal.", "My 6 month old was eating curry powder in his oatmeal.  We basically made baby oatmeal every morning and then picked spices off the rack we thought might go well together.  He ate everything we put in front of him and is now a healthy 5 year old.  \n\nOP, your wife is way off base.  Talk to your pediatrician with her.  If she doubles down again, you need to address it.  This kind of hard headed I know better than the doctors thinking is not good for mother or child.", "Lol I love this comment, this dad sounds so proud of his child \ud83d\ude02", "Sorry, my baby is definitely cuter ;) but NTA, pediatricians actually recommend exposing babies to as many flavors and textures as possible which will lead them to be less picky eaters when they\u2019re older.", "you sound like a great dad. :) NTA", "One of her first full sentences was, \"I take.\"", "If you\u2019re putting enough nutmeg to damage the baby it will be completely unpalatable as well.", "After 6 months it\u2019s should be fine for baby (in appropriate doses, at least that\u2019s what my baby cookbooks say) and has health benefits including helping with indigestion.\n\nA tiny pinch isn\u2019t enough to cause hallucinations.", "Check out Solid Starts as well! They\u2019re on Instagram and have an app you can download that shows you the safest ways to prepare food so baby won\u2019t choke.", "That's a leap of logic based on one incident, and we have not been given any information about other interactions. It sounds to me like she felt insecure and left out, and said some stupid, hurtful things. \n\nDoes it seem promising? Absolutely not, she is being incredibly rude to her husband and could be just a catty person.", "I don't want to exaggerate or anything, but my wife and I pretty much knocked it out of the park with this baby.", "I would be willing to concede to a tie.", "By the time I had my third kid, if we were having lasagna, so was he ha ha.", "> That's a leap of logic based on one incident, and we have not been given any information about other interactions.\n\nShe literally said that \"moms instinctually know what is good for there babies\".", "Awww :)  put it in a bowl instead of a plate perhaps, so it doesn't see which side you're taking it from.", "This comment made my heart smile. \n\nSpices are fine. You\u2019re not giving the kid cayenne.", "That's so wholesome. :) NTA. I hope your wife comes around.", "Best dad ever.", "I still don't see where there were any other interactions were detailed. My comment stands. \n\n\"does that sound like someone who's planning to run \"instincts\" past the person she claims has none?\"\n\nThat's you, jumping to conclusions. We have no real indicators that this is how she always is, we have only this story told from OPs perspective about this single event. Was it an awful thing to say? Yes! But does that mean OP should debase himself and be a shitty co-parent? Absolutely not. His actions are a reflection of himself, and they are coparents, not two parents acting independently of each other. She should also take that advice. \n\nYou're giving absolutely no consideration to her POV or emotional experience, or seeing the bigger picture. That's conflict management 101, I don't think you have an aptitude for it."]}
