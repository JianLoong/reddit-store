Word to the wise there are different rules of cinnamon some are better than others for developing lovers, etc. \n\nNTA for introducing your baby to food. There\u2019s emerging evidence that a lack of flavor in baby food is what leads to picky eaters. \n\nAnd also when heh say baby wants to eat what you eat that\u2019s literal. We make ourselves hard shell tacos and baby gets deconstructed taco meat with XYZ. \n\nBaby ate NY strip steak starting at 7mos. \n\nWe also did some homemade pur\u00e9e but not many. \n\nAgain follow solid starts for how to feed baby your table food you\u2019re already making.", "NTA- I'm a mom. I stopped being able to breastfeed at 4months. I pureed my own baby food (no spices) and supplemented with formula. He was off formula and onto just eating what we ate by 1 year. Every baby is different.  Every family is different.  Yes instinct is there but I just did what I had to. My son is now 11. He has a great palate. Loved rice as a baby, hates it now. Hated crunchy apples when he was 2, loves them now. I say your wife is over reacting but maybe discussing with her first would have helped. Being on the same page as the other parent is key to Co parenting.... maybe share some of the research you found with her and let her know you understand she's the mother but it doesn't mean that you don't have instincts either. Work together on a feeding plan that works for both of you. I'm sure she was worried about allergies. There's alot of information out there so maybe y'all can talk to the pediatrician together too. I don't think you're an asshole for feeding your baby.", "I watch youtube family who is vegan has alot of kids she gives the babies real fruit not cut up or mushy so i say as long you u use 1 spice at time while induce it to him make sure he not allergic..i read one time if you induce them early less chance theybbecome allergic like pb", "NTA. Um no, mom\u2019s don\u2019t have magic instincts on instinctively knowing what\u2019s good for the baby. That said; well now you know talk to your wife to be on same page.

Honestly most spices and herbs are fine for baby (although definitely look it up, there's a couple that aren't safe or recommended until they're older, and of course I'd hold off on adding any salt or sugar to their food just yet.) My son is 9 months old and I make all his food myself (same as I did with his older sister, who's 9 years old now and a thriving little foodie who loves everything from sushi to gumbo to oysters to salads.) It's actually HELPFUL to add herbs and spices to foods.

I could understand her stress when she saw the cinnamon as it can be harmful in high quantities, and who knows when it hits high quantities for a baby? But then she turns it into this mystical motherhood power you are deprived from?? Makes no sense.", "NTA. Or well, I am too then. My kid gets spiced things like sweet potatoes with cumin and cinnamon. Bananas with clove etc. \nI\u2019m a mom and while yeah there\u2019s some gut instincts, food normally isn\u2019t one of them. Your wife is off base there.", "NTA,...I am a Mom of 2 and you are totally NTA!!!  That is amazing that he found his bland food boring and he's excited with some flavor.  \n\nIn fact, I wish I had been more bold to pile the herbs and spices on (not literally, just be more inventive) very early because we're now having to work hard to even try some foods.  They aren't bad at all but I had some missed opportunities.  Overall, herbs and spices are underrated, so good on you for using them.", "NTA. She\u2019s being absolutely absurd. We fed our kid regular food, with some alterations when really needed and in segments she wouldn\u2019t choke on.

You\u2019re doing your baby a favor by introducing them to more flavors at an early age.", "She's  full of....ridiculous notions. Next doctor visit, ask, in front of wife, if it's ok for lil punkin to have cinnamon, garlic, etc.  I'm  a g-ma, and yes, it is ok. Mine all wanted hot spices.

He was looked after at her place. She and her husband were retired and just loved babies. Husband spent the day playing with my baby and she cooked up delicious vegetarian curries all day.

I agreed and ended up with a kid with really adventurous tastes.", "Europeans make wonderful tasty baby food.  As long as no allergies and ok w doc go for it.  I got my son addicted to chicken tikka masala when he was under a year old.  Still loves it!", "NTA. My aunt and uncle didn't have a lot of money when their children were young. My aunt is a phenomenal cook and used coupons and store discounts, so they always had really, really good meals. She would put whatever she and my uncle were eating in the food processor and feed it to their children. My cousins have always been the most adventurous eaters. They were never picky. You are doing your child a huge favor.", "Mothers are absolutely not blessed with perfect instincts. Otherwise child abuse and neglect would be nonexistent. It was also pretty rude to tell you that you have no instincts. That would have gutted me. You just keep on taking care of that baby and NTA. One more thing- don\u2019t introduce more than one food at a time because if he has an allergic reaction you want to be able to identify the source.", "NTA she sounds like a nut", "NTA- spices aren't going to harm your baby and mother's don't have a special instinct.", "I\u2019ll go with ESH. Your wife grew and birthed her, she deserves to know what she\u2019s eating while the baby is a baby/child. So you\u2019re a bit of a communication asshole.

I know because I was and knew many neurotic and annoying first time parents. NTA. Spices are fine. Jesus.", "My son has eaten the same thing as us since 5.5 months old. Only things I exclude are salt, honey and as much sugar as possible. But spices? I even had him try actual spicey food at 8 month. Son LIVES for food lmao and cpuld sleep between 11-13 hours.", "My daughter's pediatrician said that breastfed babies don't enjoy baby food as much as formula fed babies. The reasoning was that flavors and spices from the mother's diet come through the breast milk and the baby food is too bland to the breastfed babies. Now this really wasn't a factor for my breastfed baby as I have the palate of pasty white peasant. (Which makes sense because I hail from pasty white peasant stock.)\n\nSo adding small amounts of spice to baby food makes sense to me.", "Info\nDoes baby have reflux? \nBecause what spices normal babies can eat might have a detrimental effect there. My lo and I both have severe reflux. Someone putting cinnamon in her food would have me cussing them. You said he has been waking less since he started eating solids?", "I\u2019m torn between E-SH and N-TA. The only reason for the first is because you should only be introducing single ingredient spices one at a time at least 3 days apart. That\u2019s for allergen concerns. \n\nBut if LO has had either spice before and was fine then this is a total N-TA. Giving babies lovely yummy spices is fun.

She initially was fussy about them and would spit everything out. Then they ordered takeout from a Mexican restaurant and tried feeding her a bit of the beans and rice(mashed up a bit and separate). The little one seemingly learned to grab spoons that night and put away quite a bit. Babies are weird and like different things every other day. She's now almost 11months old and eats dang near anything if it's seasoned to her liking. She's not a fan of a few things but tastes change", "Its honestly such a dangerous mentality to have. The \u201cim a mom and i know exactly whats best for my baby\u201d is the exact reasoning the leads to parents refusing to vaccinate their children against viruses like polio because they think their kid will turn autistic.", "As a pediatric nurse I can say that any mom who insists she knows best in the face of actual research, most certainly does not know best.
