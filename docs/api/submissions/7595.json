The thing is, the plain mashed sweet potatoes and carrots are gross. So I put cinnamon in the sweet potato and some garlic powder and pepper in the carrots, just a little to make it palatable.\n\nI looked up if these are safe for babies, and they are (although honey definitely isn't, and that was one of my original ideas, so I'm glad I looked it up). For the past week he has been eating with me, and it has been awesome, and he sleeps better too. However, my wife was furious when she saw me put cinnamon in the sweet potatoes. She said it wasn't safe for the baby and I should never have done that without consulting her.\n\nI explained that I did research, but she said that didn't matter, because mother's instincts are more important. I asked what about my instincts, and she said I didn't have any. She said moms instinctually know what is good for there babies.
