Also I\u2019d honestly think of divorce (or counseling at the very least) since this goes beyond just being annoying/disgusting, the lack of respect is staggering.\n\nAny person/partner who purposely upsets their partner over and over again after being told to stop is a garbage person/partner.", "Agreed. Sometimes something unavoidable happens (pregnancy was rough for me) but if it's a regular thing that would really affect my perception of my spouse.", "1000000%", "my husband had an emergency while I was taking a bath and started to say that word as jokey proposition (I knew what it meant) and I was like I will leave you if you finish that thought (so gross) lol", "My husband and I don't have many boundaries. We've both seen each other in some pretty gruesome scenarios. However, we do NOT hang out while one of us shits. We shut the door so the other doesn't hear it. If we just have to pee, that's whatever. But I also... couldn't imagine picking the time he's in the bathroom to bust in and pee because, \"I wanted company.\" That's so disgusting."]}
