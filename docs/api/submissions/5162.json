At this point, I'm not going to take any chances to ruin what I have.", "NTA. He's not respecting the boundaries you've put in place. It's incredibly rude of him to barge in and take his time with a dump in the same room as you. The fact that he sits and watches videos and carries on instead of getting it done and over with and leaving you to your own devices, is a huge issue. \n\nWith that being said, is he on a particular schedule? I know my husband has a poop schedule as hilarious as that sounds but it's pretty predictable when he needs to go. If he refuses to listen you and you've noticed a pattern, don't take a bath around the time he needs to take a dump. If it's always when you're in the bath, that's a red flag imo. Start locking the door. This man is childish.", "INFO: Do you ask him if he needs to use the bathroom before running the bath?", "NTA, disgusting!

Is he gonna ask you to wipe for him next?\n\nYou take your nightly bath at variable times and he still always poops during the 30 minute window when you're bathing. So it's not an issue of him having to go at the same time everyday. He's intentionally crossing your very reasonable boundary to not have to smell shit while trying to relax just because he likes having someone in the room while he's pooping. I can't help but suspect this is some sort of fetish for him. Regardless, he's selfish and gross. I don't know how you're still attracted to him tbh.

Maybe go buy some poo-pouri, thing so he can pour some in the toilet before he goes. \n\nHowever, NTA: if you are being literal and they go out of their way to poop and be loud when you are in the bath.

It may be territorial in an evolutionary primate way. \n\nMy spouse does the exact same thing. I told him I was going to start locking the bathroom door for 30 minutes so I could de-stress in peace. Then, I started giving him a heads up, \"I'm starting my bath in a few minutes, so use the bathroom now. I'm going to lock the door.\" He got the message after I locked him out one time. This was years ago. Now we live in a house with four bathrooms and yet he still tries to use the bathroom when I am in the bathtub -- but we have been married for decades, so I  just say, \"Stop shitting in the bathroom when I'm in the bath, it is an a-hole thing to do. Literally.\" Also, my husband is super sensitive to fragrances, so I spray perfume in the bath water while the tub is filling, pro-actively keeping him out of the bathroom for an hour or so.

People are telling you to lock the door, but you shouldn't have to. This is about respect. If you're in there longer than an hour, then you don't respect that it's a shared space. And if you aren't, and he's busting in anyway, then he doesn't respect your privacy.\n\nYeah yeah, his \"biological need\", blah blah. He's an adult. He can plan ahead an hour or find an alternative for an hour or negotiate for her to pick a different hour if that specific hour is the one that he needs every day.", "Info:  is his nightly \"dumps\" at the same time every night?  And Have you ever discussed a time schedule?", "NTA! Lock the door next time. Everyone asking about this or that don\u2019t understand that a relationship is a two way street.
