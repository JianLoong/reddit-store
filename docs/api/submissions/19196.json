Both needs are legitimate and deserve to be accommodated. \n\nAccommodations are not a one size fits all.

They are AFAB and as you know, PDA presents very differently to other, 'classic' forms of autism, especially in AFAB autistic people, even when accounting for the differences in how 'classic' autism presents in AFAB people. \n\nMy kid does a pretty good job of masking most of their autistic traits, particularly the PDA, outside the home, but then it all tends to explode at home. Except until it all gets too much, and they end up refusing to go to school or do an activity because they're just too overwhelmed and exhausted. \n\nBut none of that fatigue and overwhelm was ever being witnessed by professionals, so no one would believe me.\n\nPlus, the former head of the local child psychiatric unit was, sadly, like many still working today within psychiatry in France, stuck in the dark ages of psychoanalysis and deeply prejudiced against me, as an autistic mum. My words were constantly misinterpreted, my autistic openness and honesty was deliberately read in a neurotypical way, as if there was some hidden meaning, plus I was speaking a second language and any errors I made were also always used against, with no allowances made for using words that are false friends, for example. It got so bad that they kept telling me I was pathologising my kids and at one point, I felt as if they were on the verge of accusing me of FII (Munchausen's by Proxy). She literally set both of my kids' diagnoses back by years.\n\nFor the next few years, it made all of us much more wary distrustful of any outside professionals that we worked with. I would wrap everything I said in protective layers and over-explain everything. It traumatised all of us.\n\nI know this sounds insane and outrageous, but she wasn't alone. I later met - and ended up making a formal complaint against - another child psych who was meant to treat my other kid, working in another unit, who told me that she didn't believe that ADHD and dyslexia - my kid's diagnoses - actually existed! This was in 2021, can you believe it!\n\nFor a long time, I thought that it was just me but since then I have met other parents in the area that have also been through the same thing and even been told by medical and social care professionals that many complaints had been made about both doctors. For the second doctor though, I was just the first parent to take action and actually write a formal complaint to the supervising hospital.\n\nIt's not unusual, even in the UK, where there is actually some specialist knowledge about PDA, unlike most other countries, for autistic kids, especially girls, to be diagnosed much later than kids with other autistic profiles.\n\nSadly, it's also even not that unusual, even in the UK, for parents of kids with PDA to face accusations of FII because it can be so difficult to diagnose - especially when waiting lists are so long and CAMHS is often bloody useless too!", "NTA.

We aren\u2019t discussing why or how they were diagnosed, we are discussing a specific situation. It seems very weird that you felt the need to point this out", "Great question, and YMMV. My experience will not encompass all folx on the spectrum of course,  but I try to educate myself since my spouse is ALSO on the spectrum. \n\nMy oldest is 10 - he is what many would consider \"high functioning \". He is also called \"twice exceptional \" in some circles, he's way above grade level in math and reading level but needs significant support on a social/emotional level. He has auditory processing issues in noisy environments, interprets things SUPER literally so there are frequent misunderstandings, and struggles to regulate his feelings.  Everything is dialed up to 11 emotionally so he's super happy, super sad, super angry, etc. Hyperfixations are to an obsessive level, to the point that it's challenging for him to think or talk about anything unrelated. Parenting challenges often involve making sure we talk to him very clearly, directly, and literally. When he has big feelings and outbursts we focus on reassuring him and only punish violent and/or destructive actions. He's super smart so we talk to him clearly about actions versus consequences, give examples to teach empathy, and work hard on coping mechanisms. He receives support in school from a Psychologist and also sees one privately outside of school. \n\nLittlest is 8 - he is considered \"low functioning\" (hate that term) or \"severely impacted\". He is not potty trained and is considered functionally nonverbal. He understands tangible things very very well, but when we're talking about concepts he struggles. For example you can show him an image of various organs in the body and he can name them,  but if you show him the same images and as ask \"which of these do you use to think?\" he struggles. He has his own auditory issues, but his more relate to certain sounds that cause him to respond with a loud noise or even have a meltdown if it persists. He hates humming with a BURNING passion. He's intelligent as well; great with mental math above grade level, and can name things like planets and specific animals without prompting. He has a direct 1x1 Para at school because his needs are so specific, and he elopes given the smallest opportunity.  Parenting him involves deep pressure at times, especially during meltdowns, and lots of soothing. He responds well to certain songs that he's fixated on or ones that we've made up and sometimes we just sing them over and over to soothe. He had such a hyperfixation on the book Little Blue Truck that I have the entire story memorized verbatim because it worked so well to soothe him. Tons of repetition and consistency and soothing. We encourage safe stims like hand flapping and repeating words or songs, and redirect ones like screaming or self harm.\n\nFrom my perspective is hyperfixations are to what a neurotypical person would consider obsessive. Sure, most kids go through a dinosaur or Egyptian phase, but a hyperfixation is all consuming and relentless.  It's reading the same book, listening to the same song, and watching the same show to the point of rote memorization and still consuming it. It's comfort in the repetition and predictability. \n\nAs an adult there can be challenges to getting diagnosed and finding support for any neurodivergence, and there are often comorbidities that come into play. A significant number of people on the autism spectrum also have ADHD, depression, anxiety, or all of the above. Start with meeting a therapist and/or a psych and go from there if you feel support and coping mechanisms would be helpful to you.\n\nAlso sorry for the novel, but I hope even a bit of this was helpful!\n\n\nEdit- that whole goddamn page and I missed the point of the post. In Op's situation this would be an empathy conversation.  We would start with an example of something he's afraid of, and talk about his feelings. When you're scared your heart may go fast, your breathing is different, you feel overstimulated and want scream, cry, run away, throw things. This is how [person] feels about [hyperfixation]. It's ok to have strong feelings  but we want to be kind and help our friends. Instead of watching a show that they will see or hear that can upset them let's read a book about it, or practice listening while our friend tells us about something they enjoy. Let's practice our social work with asking informational questions about our friend's interest to learn more!
