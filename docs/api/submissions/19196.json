There is not a big deal if you take that parent out to lunch, or both your parents. Everyone is supposed to be an adult.\n\nAre they they kind of people that just want both kids to melt down because they don't acknowledge autism as a real thing, and think you are 'enabling' these disabled kids?\n\nI have 2 autistic kids and had to keep them home plenty of times when events would be announced. It was NOT a problem for anyone else involved, except a friend of mine that I had to cut off because she kept saying 'it's OK' and i'm like NO IT IS NOT OK MY KID WOULD DESTROY YOUR ENTIRE WEDDING, PLEASE STOP ASKING ME. \n\nYou're doing the right thing <3", "NTA, my daughter is on the spectrum and we skip a lot of family events because it's not to anyone's benefit - don't want her experience major discomfort and don't want to spoil the event for everyone else with a major meltdown. You know your child best and should do what you feel is best for him.", "Nta the best thing for both kids is not being together at least for the time being.

NTA", "I'm autistic and have an autistic child and can absolutely sympathise with this situation. It is really hard sometimes when two people's stims, sensitivities, or interests clash. As the kids get older it will hopefully become more possible to find ways to work around this and compromise, but at those ages they are likely to find it hard to understand why this thing that hurts them is happening and don't yet have the skills to manage their distress in different ways. \n\nI think reducing the situations where this clash occurs is a reasonable thing to do at the moment. Later you can work on ways to help them to manage this, but right now putting them in a situation that you know is going to cause distress just seems mean for both kids (and not much fun for the adults either).\n\nSo NTA I think.", "I'm just curious the point of the entire first paragraph. How is the way that you were conceived relevant to the story?", "NTA.  OP is looking to protect their child, just like the other parents.  The only reason I can't say N A H is because bro and SiL recruited parents in their attacks on OP.  A little understanding, self awareness, and reciprocity would have gone a long way here.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t taking the kids needs into account. Only adults wants", "NAH,\n\nHowever, is there no way to separate the two.  David can watch his dinos with headphones on one side and Elly can play on the other.  I'm guessing if it's a BBQ it outside.  There should be plenty of space to keep them apart.", "NTA I think you should buy a Dino suit and have your husband ware it to events I wonder how long it would be until separate events are mandatory", "NAH\n\nAs someone on the spectrum, I understand both sides. Your family wants to have everyone together, but it\u2019s not at the best interest for either child. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a compromise!\n\nAs an aside, I think you\u2019re handling this well. The Dino thing might be something he moves on from, or your niece might outgrow her fear of Dinos. Either way, for the time being it might be best to keep them separate.\n\nParenting a child on the spectrum isn\u2019t easy, but if this is an indicator you seem to be doing just fine.", "I think this is a bit of NAH.\n\nYou're thinking about the well fare of the kids and avoiding meltdowns, especially as Ryan's special interest is a trigger for Elly.

Perhaps there is a way for to improve that outside of a large group gathering.", "NTA.

If me and David were aware of these, we would have put more thought on having our own children, as some are very serious. Unfortunately we only found out about it after Elly and Ryan were born and Elly started showing some warning signs.", "Maybe you should look more closely into how you were conceived too. It's abundantly clear why she included it.", "It currently gets to the point where Ryan wants to show how cool his Dino's are to Elly and everyone else. Elly is scared of them and doesn't want to see them or liking seeing Ryan getting attention from other people when she doesn't at the same time.\n\nWe are still trying to find a pair of headphones that Ryan would be comfortable with.

Currently they are kids that see the world different and adapt to it differently, so it is very hard to explain to them why they can't do what they like because it upsets the other", "We have tried and have a bearded dragon as one of our pets, which Ryan adores. But he is currently very focused on Dino's and doesn't seem to want to divert his attention to anything else (he also found my husband's alien and predator collection and seem to be interested in those, but we are trying to leave it until he is older).", "As an autistic person\u2026. Yeah, no, Ryan would not be able to transfer his special interest to reptiles.  He might like them, but he\u2019d be back to his predatory Dino\u2019s in about four minutes.  Wouldn\u2019t solve the issues of his cousin freaking out over attention she\u2019s not getting, either.", "They may very feel that way. There is a lot of misinformation out there about autism and if you and your brothers children are the first in the family, there is often a steep learning curve for those inexperienced. \n\nI\u2019m autistic and have experience working with autistic children. It honestly sounds like you\u2019re doing the best thing for both kids in this situation. You\u2019re accommodating both of their needs and acknowledging that right now their needs don\u2019t align. That doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll never be able to have them at the same function again, it just means that right now it\u2019s better for both of them to have separate functions or visit on different days. \n\nI can understand that your family want to be able to celebrate things as a whole unit but right now that isn\u2019t possible. It doesn\u2019t mean you hate your niece, it just mean that, for the comfort of her and your own child, for the moment they aren\u2019t at the same events.", "The difference in behavior between the two kids probably makes them see them differently from one another, obviously a mistake", "Autism can present itself with no known family history.", "Which is irrelevant to the conflict.", "It's not because it doesn't matter why the kids have autism.", "Just don't hold yourself so separate from the family. If you can go over for a couple of hours while everyone is there while your partner holds down the fort with Ryan, it will keep you connected with your entire extended family. \n\nI think you also need to continue to communicate what you just said to your brother and SIL. Right now, Elly and Ryan's interest and trigger clash and once Ryan moves on or Elly is less bothered, you can bring them back together.", "That's so cool you got a bearded dragon!", "Yes it does, autism has a genetic/heritable component.", "No shit, never said it didn't. The point is, that the reason the kids have autism has nothing to do with the conflict with which OP is asking for judgement.", "Not as directly as OP is implying and not in every case.", "I wonder if OP included this information to try and preemptively shut down debates about this being \"fake\" because there are two autistic kids in the same family. Just a thought.", "You are really thick, huh? Probability is a relevant thing to consider, it doesn't have to be guaranteed in order to be significant or something additional concern should be had for.", "That doesn't make sense either though. Because the the only thing it implies is that autism is inhertable, which would still be the case no matter how they were conceived.", "You're still not getting it. The way that OP and her sibling were conceived had no bearing on whether or not OP is the asshole in the situation that she posted about. If you still can't grasp that, that's on you.", "I can perfectly grasp that, what you can't grasp is that context generally matters. The point OP is making is had he known about those facets of their genetic background, he possibly wouldn't have chosen to bring more blood relatives into this world, and was likely trying to offset potential comments of \"it's your fault and your problem your progeny is neuodivergent \". \n\nThere's an argument to be made you consent to ND complications in your children if you're aware of the history, and you need to accept all the burden of these complications on yourself and accommodate others; OP is explaining he got blindsided by this same as all others in the story and bears no additional responsibility for knowingly breeding with high risk factors of such problems."]}
