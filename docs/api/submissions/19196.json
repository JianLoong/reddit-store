It\u2019s very common where there\u2019s family history", "Signs of neurodivergence, absolutely. \u201cWarning signs\u201d would only be used if you considered it to be worthy of panicking about. The fact that op started this comment with a bunch of irrelevant information about how his mother was somehow tricked into introducing autism into the family bloodline is very odd, don\u2019t you think? That plus using \u201cwarning signs\u201d makes me feel very uncomfortable. Edited for clarity", "So true. My cousin married a woman. Their son is autistic. The woman has a brother. Brother has two sons. One son is also autistic. Neither of them are adopted or have different dads. I have met both of these children, can confirm no one is pretending they're autistic for reddit karma. Autism runs in families because of heritability, and that would be the case no matter what."]}
