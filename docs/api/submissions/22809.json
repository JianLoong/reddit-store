Like ok I can understand a white shift dress or something that has a print on it that wouldn't be mistaken for a wedding dress...but to wear an *actual* wedding dress to a someone else's wedding? That is wild.\n\nDefinitely NTA. OP needs to listen to her husband and get better friends.", "You \u201dusually\u201d weren\u2019t married. Life moves on. True friends grow and change with you. They don\u2019t throw embarrassing public temper tantrums.\n\nThis is reflecting poorly on your judgment and your taste in friends.", "You're on your honey moon with your husband and you're worried about your \"friend\" who wore a white wedding dress to your wedding being upset with you because you usually call each other every day?  \nYou seriously need to step back and re-evaluate this entire situation at a high level. The idea that you \\*must\\* call a friend every single day, including on your honey moon, is deranged.\n\nAlso you're probably giving your husband second thoughts. If this was happening to me on my honeymoon I would be very anxious about the future.

My husband and I turned off our data/Wi-Fi for our entire honeymoon. It\u2019s supposed to be an amazing trip for you to enjoy being newlyweds, not to talk to your friends once a day, especially when they aren\u2019t being nice to you.
