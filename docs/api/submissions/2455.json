On the 20th of October my ex broke up with me telling me she didn't love me anymore. The main reasons she gave me was that I wasn't there enough for her and she was frustrated with my lack of housework. This was all completely valid, I've been severely depressed and was slacking hard. She made no attempt to make it work and wanted to end the relationship then and there which she did.\n\nNow I was absolutely devastated, I loved this girl immensely and been with her for 6 years, I was even planning to ask her to marry me in 2024 and had a ring picked and was saving up for it. I went through 2 years of homelessness for her (a whole other story i wont get into) so I could live in the same country as her. I left a lot behind just for her. So understandably I'm very frustrated that she didn't try and talk to me before hand so we could fix these issues. Her reason being for not telling me is she was worried I would do something stupid, which I wouldn't have, as proven by when she ended it with me.\n\nAfter all this I told her she could stay till she finds a place till January however recently she's been talking to a guy who she met a week before she left me (He was a college friend I reconnected with and I introduced them both)and has been unloading her feelings on him while shutting me out completely and ending any conversation I start with her. She's also been doing all the stuff we used to do with him. I feel betrayed by this and just can't have this happen to me under the same roof, it hurts way too much. So with this and just living with someone you love immensely and doesnt love you back, I told her yesterday that she needs to leave by the 15th of December for my own physical and mental wellbeing. She very clearly angry at me and says I'm an asshole. Am I the asshole for telling her she has a month to leave?\n\n(Sorry for the crazy format, I'm not thinking very well tbh)\n\nExtra bits of context:\nUnfortunately all my local friends were originally her friends so they hate me now and I have no one to talk to physically, which hurts.\n\nI have no family where I currently live\n\nShe said she started to stop loving me the past year which has been the peak of my depression.\n\nIf any more context is needed just let me know.\n\nEdit:\nForgot to add her situation like an idiot. She doesn't have anyone in the area she can live with and no family in our city, her job is low paying (only reason she stays there is that she likes all her coworkers and are good friends with them. She has basically no credit score as he relied on me for that and she also owns our cats so she needs to find a pet friendly place which isn't always easy.\n\nEdit 2:\nThe flat is rented social housing, I'm the one who's on and signed the tenancy, she moved in a month later.\n\nEdit 3: Forgot to mention (seeing a theme here) that her parents do have a spare bedroom at their place about an hour and 30 mins away, so worst case scenario she's living with them again.", "created_utc": 1668598417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywr14w/aita_for_telling_my_ex_she_has_a_month_to_move_out/", "score": 785, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is single now and can do what she wants. \n\nYour changed the agreement now to punish her for her way of dealing with the break up and you want her to suffer even as far as homelessness out of spite. That tells me a lot about your character honestly, especially if you admit yourself that you have been a shitty partner the last months of your relationship, so you are as much responsible that this relationship didn't work out as your gf. You say you truly love your ex, but why would you be a bad partner then? And why would you want a person you still love to suffer? I think you don't love her so much as you say, you just loved to love her and being loved by her, but not her as a person and now your ego is unhappy and thats why you want her to suffer. \n\nIf you kick her out now there is a huge chance her only option is to move in with a guy.

I've genuinely tried so hard to make it work but I just mentally can't keep up, especially when she gives me constant reminders were never getting back together or that she's gonna take the cats. If it was out of spite I would have kicked her out immediately or copied her and posted screen shots to everyone of conversations like she has. I can say with confidence despite the break in the original agreement I've been the bigger person. And yes I made mistakes in the relationship, I let mental illness destroy my relationship.

Can you just end your lease and move back to where you have family and friends? Can you get a job where you have a support system? I think it says a lot that YOU moved to an area where she has lots of friends and family, you're feeling depressed, and the one close friend you had she seems to be wanting to date. My guess is that she's hoping to establish things enough with him to move from you to him, but if you kick her out earlier than that, she'll have to move back in with her parents and lose HER friend group.\n\nDo what is best for your mental health.

That tells me how selfish and how much you\u2019ve lacked accountability in this relationship.\n\nYou gave her until January to find a new place.

You just thought you could just dump the all the housework on her and she\u2019d grumble but keep doing it forever because her happiness wasn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d issue\n\nYEAH sucks to live with your ex BUT you had an agreement, she moves out January. Now you\u2019re backing out that makes you an AH. You admit she\u2019s not dating that guy and inviting him over", "So you\u2019re only trying because she broke up with you (meaning you can do this) and I bet the minute she would take you back you\u2019d be back to your normal self.", "If you're in the UK, you need to give her 2 months notice, legally.", "She's not dating anyone. OP even stated she's not dating that guy. He's worded it duplicitously in the OP to serve his own agenda.  \n\n\nedit to incl link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywr14w/comment/iwkx2f0/", "One, not everywhere is the US.\n\nTwo, you can always ask people to leave immediately. And sometimes paying them off is easier than waiting 30 days. Typically this is called \"cash for keys\", and is an easy solution for everyone. \n\nHad a bad breakup where ex cheated on me. I handed her enough cash for a month in a hotel, and asked politely to GTFO.", "She isn't dating that guy. OP has made it clear in comments.\n\nShe tried to talk to OP about her concerns and he ignored her.", "She didn't cheat on him. Where are you getting that from? OP said his ex is still single now.", "she can't cheat on him even if she was dating this new guy, they're broken up. you can't cheat on an ex.", "Why?", "Yea clearly some shits got muddled up, she never threatened to leave me nor made any indication when asking me to do house work that it was taking that much of a strain on her, she said in a monotone voice \"hey op can you do the (house chore) please\" and that was it, if I truly knew I would have stepped up belive me. For some extra info, I purposely bought a dishwasher and other bits like that to help clean out of my own pocket.", "No not at all, I've changed for the better", "Interesting how certain you are of laws and rights when op doesn't say what country they're in", "Thanks for including the link, I didn't see that comment. Yeah, he is misrepresenting it, he's a bit of a dick for that. However, it's also his house. He has the right to have it back since they're no longer in a relationship. \n\nSo yeah, he shouldn't be misrepresenting it, that's shite. But if she's not involved with him anymore, he's really under no obligation to let her stay. She quit the relationship, it's his place. Down to her to leave.", "Proof in a lot of cases is simply a piece of mail with your name on it and that address. It doesn't need to be a bill. \n\nThere's a documentary on Netflix about a dude who was a serial squatter by basically 'renting' a room, getting mail to the address right away and then refusing to leave and even taking the owner to court. It was nuts.", "Oh okay gotcha but still ftb", "OP said she's \"doing everything she used to do with [him]\" with another guy she met a week before the breakup. Certainly emotional cheating, no?", "No. The conversations and getting close happened Pre-breakup", "OP is not asking anyone to say EX is an anus.  Clinical depression is a real thing, and one of the aspects is lack of awareness of others' issues.  I think he has figured that much out, base on his comments.  Hopefully he will now seek the professional help he needs to get better.\n\nBut he was NAH when he cut her move-out time to just over 30 days.  Once she decided to cut her losses and get involved with someone else, it wasn't healthy for either of them for her to stay.  His lease, his apartment, apparently him paying all or most of the bills.  He stays.  She goes.  Best solution for an unhappy situation.", "So you need to be threatened with a break up in order to not be a shitty partner? Come on, this is ridiculous. You only seem to care when you\u2019re faced with immediate consequences, sounds awful, I feel for her. You keep minimising your role in this and me thinks you were much more at fault that you\u2019re letting us know, only dropping hints but not telling a full story.\n\nSo you bought a dishwasher to help with chores and let me guess, who\u2019s loading it? Her. You\u2019re like the 50s husband buying vacuum cleaner for Christmas for his wife. Awfully misogynistic.", "No, you think you\u2019ve changed but from everything you said it sounds like you\u2019ve only changed because you want something in return and are throwing a tantrum because you\u2019re not getting it. You\u2019ve had countless chances to change before. And I guarantee that if she was to come back to you, you\u2019d revert back to your normal self in no time because there\u2019s nothing threatening you anymore.", "Ok? Based on U.S. laws. I dont pretend to know how squatters rights work in other countries. Or of any place where you can LEGALLY evict someone \"just because\". Especially if only one person is on the lease, then they BOTH violated it. Eviction is a slippery slope and hr could very well end up playing himself in the long run. Roommate evictions almost always get reported back to the landlord, as the eviction is happening on their property.", "Yeah, she shouldn't get to live there forever, but if they agreed on Jan, then he can't change his mind to boot her out just before Christmas. Finding a new place that accepts pets is hard.", "I think it\u2019s really hard to judge a rhythm of doing things, compared to \u201c\u201d\u201dnormal\u201d\u201d\u201d, when depression is involved so I wouldn\u2019t be hasty to judge here. If the chores were getting done, that\u2019s what should matter.", ">Or of any place where you can LEGALLY evict someone \"just because\".\n\nHe's given a month's notice and she doesn't have an agreement, from a little Google search that seems to be legal in the us. \n\n>then they BOTH violated it\n\nHow do you know the lease has been violated? Someone else living there doesn't necessarily mean that, it wouldn't bee against the lease in uk social housing. \n\nYou really should stop taking in such definites, you seem to be getting things wrong. OP also mentioned he moved country to be with her so there's a decent chance it isn't the us.", "But you see, the thing is, he can.", "If she can agree to a relationship and then just change her mind and end it, then yes he can agree to one date and then change his mind.", "She ended the relationship despite their agreements, why can't he change his mind despite their agreements?", "So is sharing a space with someone you love, who doesn\u2019t love you, and is using your past acquaintance as her emotional crutch to get through the break up while you\u2019re surrounded by no external support. She\u2019s ab idiot for breaking up with him with no exit plan, and then bringing another friend around to comfort herself in front of him. Okay stupid games\u2026"]}
