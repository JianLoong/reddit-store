On the 20th of October my ex broke up with me telling me she didn't love me anymore. The main reasons she gave me was that I wasn't there enough for her and she was frustrated with my lack of housework. This was all completely valid, I've been severely depressed and was slacking hard. She made no attempt to make it work and wanted to end the relationship then and there which she did.\n\nNow I was absolutely devastated, I loved this girl immensely and been with her for 6 years, I was even planning to ask her to marry me in 2024 and had a ring picked and was saving up for it. I went through 2 years of homelessness for her (a whole other story i wont get into) so I could live in the same country as her. I left a lot behind just for her. So understandably I'm very frustrated that she didn't try and talk to me before hand so we could fix these issues. Her reason being for not telling me is she was worried I would do something stupid, which I wouldn't have, as proven by when she ended it with me.\n\nAfter all this I told her she could stay till she finds a place till January however recently she's been talking to a guy who she met a week before she left me (He was a college friend I reconnected with and I introduced them both)and has been unloading her feelings on him while shutting me out completely and ending any conversation I start with her. She's also been doing all the stuff we used to do with him. I feel betrayed by this and just can't have this happen to me under the same roof, it hurts way too much. So with this and just living with someone you love immensely and doesnt love you back, I told her yesterday that she needs to leave by the 15th of December for my own physical and mental wellbeing. She very clearly angry at me and says I'm an asshole. Am I the asshole for telling her she has a month to leave?\n\n(Sorry for the crazy format, I'm not thinking very well tbh)\n\nExtra bits of context:\nUnfortunately all my local friends were originally her friends so they hate me now and I have no one to talk to physically, which hurts.\n\nI have no family where I currently live\n\nShe said she started to stop loving me the past year which has been the peak of my depression.\n\nIf any more context is needed just let me know.\n\nEdit:\nForgot to add her situation like an idiot. She doesn't have anyone in the area she can live with and no family in our city, her job is low paying (only reason she stays there is that she likes all her coworkers and are good friends with them. She has basically no credit score as he relied on me for that and she also owns our cats so she needs to find a pet friendly place which isn't always easy.\n\nEdit 2:\nThe flat is rented social housing, I'm the one who's on and signed the tenancy, she moved in a month later.\n\nEdit 3: Forgot to mention (seeing a theme here) that her parents do have a spare bedroom at their place about an hour and 30 mins away, so worst case scenario she's living with them again.\n\nEdit 4: it seems I've accidentally made it seem that the guy she was talking to is in a relationship with her, to my knowledge this is not the case and he's not really her type.\n\nEdit 5: we don't live in the US and I've made sure to check, I can ask her to leave without legal problems. Though I'd like to think she wouldn't go down this avenue anyway.\n\nEdit 6: no I will not keep the cats, as much as I love them they are hers and I would never do that to her.", "created_utc": 1668598417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywr14w/aita_for_telling_my_ex_she_has_a_month_to_move_out/", "score": 1322, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That tells me a lot about your character honestly, especially if you admit yourself that you have been a shitty partner the last months of your relationship, so you are as much responsible that this relationship didn't work out as your gf. You say you truly love your ex, but why would you be a bad partner then? And why would you want a person you still love to suffer? I think you don't love her so much as you say, you just loved to love her and being loved by her, but not her as a person and now your ego is unhappy and thats why you want her to suffer. \n\nIf you kick her out now there is a huge chance her only option is to move in with a guy.

I've genuinely tried so hard to make it work but I just mentally can't keep up, especially when she gives me constant reminders were never getting back together or that she's gonna take the cats. If it was out of spite I would have kicked her out immediately or copied her and posted screen shots to everyone of conversations like she has.

My guess is that she's hoping to establish things enough with him to move from you to him, but if you kick her out earlier than that, she'll have to move back in with her parents and lose HER friend group.\n\nDo what is best for your mental health.

Give until Dec 1", " I feel like there's information that's missing.", "Actually dec. 15th & jan 1--two weeks  early.  Not that much difference.\n\n90 minute drive is a long drive 2x a day.  But hey she could always sleep over with new guy.  \nYou are giving her a month's notice --so I think, as presented NTA.\n\nSeems kinda gross that she's rubbing your face in new relationship.  \n\nBut you need to deal with Your mental health issues.  Letting depression take over like that was likely miserable for your GF.", "and people like you are why people stay trapped in unhappy or abusive relationships because they can't just leave. So her options currently are to be kicked out of her house or stay in a relationship that makes her unhappy.\n\nAnd you ignore the fact that he said she had until the end of the year and then suddenly changed his mind. He's a huge AH. I get that he's hurt but because a woman breaks up with a man suddenly she gets kicked out of her home where she's lived for years.\n\nIt sounds like they moved in together and it's just legally his place. Not like he moved his girlfriend into his place. It's her home as much as his.\n\nI once broke up with an abusive partner. She moved in with me and then we got an apartment together. Even though she didn't pay for anything, her name was on the lease, and she didn't move out for three months. It sucked, but sometimes breakups suck. You people being absolutely heartless to her situation are astounding. What did she do wrong? She should have just stayed in a relationship with someone she didn't love anymore?", "If you break up with someone, you have to be prepared to never see them again (because it is well within your ex's right to demand never having you in their life ever again). She really needed to think how the breakup would affect her housing situation long ago.", "She\u2019s literally paying half the bills bro!", "I thought I was going crazy, he's the one with major depression and he's been absolutely slacking, but SHE did nothing to fix the situation? How the hell is she supposed to fix his depression?", "And if I was him I'd pack her things/put them out and change the locks. All that tenant rights stuff really only applies to the landlords, if he's the only one on the lease she really can't do much to fight him.. Yea it's a dick move but so is dumping someone and then immediately dating the friend they introduced you to while you're still living at their place.. If she had common sense she would have played it more carefully knowing she isn't on the lease, she doesn't have a good paying job, no one to stay with etc. The girl's been out of love with him all year so she should have figured out her exit strategy by now.", "Finally, a comment actually recognizing how much of an impact depression can have.", "Yea there absolutely is, when I had written this my mind was jumbled and confused, still is honestly, so I've unfortunately missed a few things, some more important than others. Not had much time to fix as I'm working atm, will sort in a couple hours though and add much needed edits. Though this post is blowing up a lot more than I expected so maybe I should do it soon instead.", "And every time she butches about it, say nothing except, \"December 14th\" she'll say something else, \"December 13th,\" \"December 12th,\" and so on. Then stick to it. \n\nIf she doesn't want to move back in with mom and dad (I suspect she sees your friend as a better catch and is trying to land him) be prepared for the 'oh, I was wrong, I love you, let's stay together.' She doesn't. But people can be incredibly mercenary with one another. \n\nGood luck. I have been through the same damn thing. I am a woman, men do it to us, too.", "He said she needed to leave for his mental health. Should he be forced to suffer instead? If her parents have a spare room 90 minutes away, she clearly has a place to go. Also, what about the guy she's currently seeing, why does she not go live with him? If she fell out of love with him a long time before, maybe being honest then would have bought her time to figure herself out, possibly give them a chance to either work things out or even end on good terms as friends.. Instead, she waited till she found another man smh.. If he was given no chance, why should she be given one? seems like she is just swinging from one monkey branch to the next.", "It\u2019s not horrible but he shouldn\u2019t have to let her live in his place", "*should have", "Yes. He doesn't get to kick someone out of their home for years in \"days\" as the person in the comment said, because he is uncomfortable with her with someone else on the excuse of her mental health. She's not seeing that guy. They're friends. And even if they were, they just met. You know how dangerous that is for a woman? \n\nYou're making assumptions and being sexist, as are most of the people here. The term \"monkey branch\" is an extremely sexist one.", "Friend or not she still had to leave no questions asked. So much entitlement from your comments. No she didn\u2019t, op\u2019s post says \u201cshe didn\u2019t try to talk to me before hand so we could fix these things\u201d. And also she didnt say anything about leaving. Plus you are assuming she did it all and still have some respect when you live with someone and do some extra dishes who cares. I washed my roomates clothes when he had to work and i had ti stay with him for 3 months to finish uni. Also you are not fooling anyone with that \u201cfriend\u201d narrative, the one guy is even her type as he mentions and emotion cheat exists and it existed 1 week before they ended their relationship. Its really crazy how you justify her living with her ex and talking to new guys. What should he have to cope with next? Bringing them over? Too bad he didnt evict her from the first moment, in spite his ex he has decency and is not mentally and psychologically killing his soulmate (as he really wanted to marry her and did everything to live with her). Ahh thats too hard to understand when there is that much entitlement.", "*Their place.", "It\u2019s not just his place, she lives there too and they made a deal for January so she should get to stay till January.\n\nOP litterally said \u201cWe split the bill 50/50\u201d", "Yeah that sounds like multiple levels of fraud if he didn\u2019t add her and her income to the lease.", "OP's \\*post\\* says she didn't. OP's \\*comments\\* say she did. OP is the definition of an unreliable narrator here. He says he was helping \"just slowly\"; when asked about slowly, he says taking a whole day to do dishes. So if he's doing just a sink of dishes in a whole day, who was doing the sweeping, the mopping, the cooking, the laundry, cleaning the bathrooms? Right then. And she's \\*paying rent\\* to live there. Some entitlement.  \n\n\nShe does need to move out. But the plan was January, and I'm sure she was \\*budgeting\\* for January. Not \"now you have to scramble to move the week before Christmas.\" *That* change is squarely OP trying to punish her for talking to mutual friend instead of rehashing things with him.", "Dude you need a therapist, and I mean that in almost the least snarky way.", "No you haven't", "Except she only met him a week before she broke up with him. He is a college friend of OP.", ">You are speaking about this as if OP is american, and just by reading his post I dont believe he is.\n\nNo, I believe they are British. Tenancy laws are even stronger in the UK.\n\n>Many HUD housing units do month to month leases, not 6 month or year. Just so they can remove you if they want/need too.  HUD could now evict OP for having someone live with him and never report it.\n\nHUD is an American agency. With that said, \"removal\" doesn't consist of \"giving someone a few days to leave\" and then bouncing them. HUD very much does give a fuck about tennants' rights. If they want to kick you out (and you refuse to go) they go through the legal eviction process like everyone else.\n\n>Tennets laws are a thing, sure, but HUD housing dont give a fuck.\n\nYes, yes they do.", "If she didn't like it she could leave. No its not punishing when you are literally depressed, away from home having friends only thru your gf  and you have to watch your love of your life do the things you loved doing together.  Also you never mentioned all the things she did to be with her and to marry her. People will never remember the goood things you do, only the bad. She is really petty and who cares if she is budgeting or not. Her actions should have consequences, can't just end a 6 year relationship and start running with a \"friend\". \n\nThe vote is gonna say NTA and your fds comments are gonna be met with decency and humanity towards your past lover, rather than no accountability we can do whatever we want.

I would havr only been late on rent, for the first time in 5 years; qnd he said he could still get me kicked out. \n\nListen I'm glad I left cause the complex ia now in new hands, qnd im really fucking glad I am not in texas anymore but still. \n\nEdit - im sorry I was rude btw.
