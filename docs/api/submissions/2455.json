{"id": 2455, "submission_id": "ywr14w", "title": "AITA For telling my ex she has a month to move out?", "selftext": "Now for the context. On the 20th of October my ex broke up with me telling me she didn't love me anymore. The main reasons she gave me was that I wasn't there enough for her and she was frustrated with my lack of housework. This was all completely valid, I've been severely depressed and was slacking hard. She made no attempt to make it work and wanted to end the relationship then and there which she did.\n\nNow I was absolutely devastated, I loved this girl immensely and been with her for 6 years, I was even planning to ask her to marry me in 2024 and had a ring picked and was saving up for it. I went through 2 years of homelessness for her (a whole other story i wont get into) so I could live in the same country as her. I left a lot behind just for her. So understandably I'm very frustrated that she didn't try and talk to me before hand so we could fix these issues. Her reason being for not telling me is she was worried I would do something stupid, which I wouldn't have, as proven by when she ended it with me.\n\nAfter all this I told her she could stay till she finds a place till January however recently she's been talking to a guy who she met a week before she left me (He was a college friend I reconnected with and I introduced them both)and has been unloading her feelings on him while shutting me out completely and ending any conversation I start with her. She's also been doing all the stuff we used to do with him. I feel betrayed by this and just can't have this happen to me under the same roof, it hurts way too much. So with this and just living with someone you love immensely and doesnt love you back, I told her yesterday that she needs to leave by the 15th of December for my own physical and mental wellbeing. She very clearly angry at me and says I'm an asshole. Am I the asshole for telling her she has a month to leave?\n\n(Sorry for the crazy format, I'm not thinking very well tbh)\n\nExtra bits of context:\nUnfortunately all my local friends were originally her friends so they hate me now and I have no one to talk to physically, which hurts.\n\nI have no family where I currently live\n\nShe said she started to stop loving me the past year which has been the peak of my depression.\n\nIf any more context is needed just let me know.\n\nEdit:\nForgot to add her situation like an idiot. She doesn't have anyone in the area she can live with and no family in our city, her job is low paying (only reason she stays there is that she likes all her coworkers and are good friends with them. She has basically no credit score as he relied on me for that and she also owns our cats so she needs to find a pet friendly place which isn't always easy.\n\nEdit 2:\nThe flat is rented social housing, I'm the one who's on and signed the tenancy, she moved in a month later.\n\nEdit 3: Forgot to mention (seeing a theme here) that her parents do have a spare bedroom at their place about an hour and 30 mins away, so worst case scenario she's living with them again.", "created_utc": 1668598417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywr14w/aita_for_telling_my_ex_she_has_a_month_to_move_out/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some people telling you to kick her out immediately are unaware of the UK housing crisis. \n\nYou CAN, however, establish boundaries for the next 30 days of tenancy.

And I saw from your below comments that you cover the internet bill- change your Wi-Fi password and don\u2019t give your ex the new one. She broke up with you- no more subsidizing her life.

Youre not kicking her out because yall broke up. Youre kicking her out, after having to agree to let her stay till Jan, a month sooner because she meant it when she said it was over, and is acting accordingly. Exs shut you out emotionally. Thats why they are your ex. \n\nEveryone saying kick her out now doesn't know how the law works. You'd have to give her notice and if she doesn't comply, then you'll have to go through a roommate eviction being that she's not on the lease. \n\nYou cannot put her or her stuff out on the streets. \n\nThen you'll have to wait for court, which could take a month or longer (in cities at least) THEN the judge will give a date for her to vacate, which can/will be enforced by local law - which is usually 30 days after the court date, barring any continuance.\n\nThis can absolutely be extended another 3-6 months if the courts (rightfully) get involved.", "NTA.

You are going her a month", "I mean, I would tell her to get out this weekend. Call her parents, tell them the situation and ask them to come get her stuff. Kicked her out 2 weeks earlier isn\u2019t going to help your mental health enough to be worth the headache, so get her out now, especially because if she\u2019s kicking up a fuss over the 2 weeks, she might be planning on simply not leaving, and you need to know NOW if you need to get a lawyer involved.", "I\u2019d tell her she needs to leave over the weekend. Be prepared to change the locks.", "I go against the majority here and say YTA. \n\nYou made an agreement how long she can stay when you broke up. She is single now and can do what she wants. \n\nYour changed the agreement now to punish her for her way of dealing with the break up and you want her to suffer even as far as homelessness out of spite. That tells me a lot about your character honestly, especially if you admit yourself that you have been a shitty partner the last months of your relationship, so you are as much responsible that this relationship didn't work out as your gf. You say you truly love your ex, but why would you be a bad partner then? And why would you want a person you still love to suffer? I think you don't love her so much as you say, you just loved to love her and being loved by her, but not her as a person and now your ego is unhappy and thats why you want her to suffer. \n\nIf you kick her out now there is a huge chance her only option is to move in with a guy. I hope this makes you happy :)", "Yta because she has on where to go or no family. Try to get your shit together bruv.", "YTA. You agreed to let her stay until January.

Technically she doesn't live there", "Yea I can afford rent fine luckily (I think) I live in a super awful area so rent is super cheap", "I can garentee you it was never to punish her, I've been in absolute mental agony for weeks since this event, I've been constantly helping her be stress free by doing all the house work, cooking for her, helping her find a place everyday and making sure she's overall healthy. I've genuinely tried so hard to make it work but I just mentally can't keep up, especially when she gives me constant reminders were never getting back together or that she's gonna take the cats. If it was out of spite I would have kicked her out immediately or copied her and posted screen shots to everyone of conversations like she has. I can say with confidence despite the break in the original agreement I've been the bigger person. And yes I made mistakes in the relationship, I let mental illness destroy my relationship. But I've taken that and changed myself for the better.\n\nAnd it would have been worth mentioning her parents do have a spare room she can stay in, she'll never be homeless. I'd never do that to her, especially after what I went through with homelessness", "Ah my bad I litrally just updated the post with missing info, her parents live about 1 hour and 30mins away and do have a spare bedroom, so worst case senario she's living with them again", "I am helping her find a place, but I'm at my limit mentally, I'd rather she be living at her parents worst case senario than me offing myself.", "Depending on local laws though, in the US, she has established residency and is due a 30 day notice to vacate.", "Yeah so sorry OP.\n\nBreakups are the worst. I think it\u2019s good to keep the 30 days so she has time, but stick to it, don\u2019t let her manipulate you into letting her stay longer (except in the rare case that her new accommodation won\u2019t let her in for 3 days after the cutoff). \n\nOnce she\u2019s out you can heal and move forward.", "If you have some important papers, or things that are very dear to you (photos or keepsakes), think about putting them in a locked closet, chest, or room.  Maybe put them into a box and let a very trusted friend keep it at their house until she is gone.\n\nMost breakups are painful and move forward ok.  Sometimes an ex may get angry, or have emotional rages and might try to destroy the things dear to you.\n\nYou don't need to point this out, just quietly take those things and put them away.\n\nI hope this relationship and housing problems ends quickly and you are ok.", "Seems like emotional cheating at the least", "Either way if you're uncomfortable with the situation your nta for asking her to move out. Her being there isn't going to make the breakup any easier on either of yous", "Thank you. NTA. Living with an ex post break up is always tough and should be avoided.", "\"Technicalities\" mean shit here. \nThey split the bills 50/50 AND she's been living there more than 30 days. Which means she can claim squatters rights. Now if it goes to court (& landlord didn't know there was a 2nd tenant) it can go from a roommate eviction to an entire occupancy eviction (for violating the lease)  Meaning both of them and the cats could be s.o.l. \n\nAnd in today's day, landlord are willing to evict QUICK to rent out at higher prices. \n\nI've (unfortunately) got entirely way too much experience with this. I've been both the OP & the Ex.", "I've already put a lot of that stuff away, mostly just what evers in boxes and such"]}
