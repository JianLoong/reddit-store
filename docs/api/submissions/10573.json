Do not ask me about this again.\u201d", "Tell sister that it was hubbys decision as the head of the family so she can\u2019t change it", "Don\u2019t insult your brother by hearing her out. It isn\u2019t a contest.  You made a choice that you believe is in your kid\u2019s best interest.  Your sister won\u2019t stop by just being heard out.  Shut it down.  \n\nThen see an estate attorney to make it legal and airtight if your brother and his spouse agree.  \nThen set up financial support.  An insurance policy perhaps.  If your brother foes have to raise your kids, you want him to have the use of funds you can leave.  \nIdeally, this should be discussed between you, your brother, his spouse, and your attorney.", "NTA, but maybe you should hear her out just so you can immediately be like \"Thank you. Our core values vastly differ, and I don't want any of that for my children at all, so I'll be passing on your offer. Now please do not bring it up again. But thank you.\"", "I'm so sorry for your loss! NTA. If this comes up again with your sister, you just need to say that you and your husband discussed it and made the decision together, so there's no case to be made and no further discussing needed, and leave it at that.", "NTA. Look at the Duggar family to get a sense of the morality they would be sharing. God forbid anything happen to you. Your brother and his husband likely won't brainwash your kids into essentially a cult.", "NTA, and no, I would not be \u201chearing out\u201d your sister. If pushed, I think I\u2019d just say that it\u2019s something that you *and your husband* discussed and decided before he died and, now that the time has come, you are going to honor him as their father by doing what the *two* of you, mutually, agreed upon.\n\nAny attempts to argue about whether or not that conversation *actually* took place, or whether or not the two of you made the \u201cright\u201d decision, or whether or not you should be bound by a decision made before your husband died, would be rude and insulting; they can be met with silence.", "NTA. You\u2019re not required to \u201chear her out.\u201d She has zero right to your children. You are their parent. You decide what\u2019s best for them. You make the decisions and you are not required to entertain anyone else\u2019s suggestions or input. You don\u2019t need to justify your choice or offer an explanation. Simply say \u201cI\u2019ve already made my decision and the matter is closed.\u201d Do not engage. If your mom wants to hear your sister\u2019s pitch so badly she can call her up and listen to it herself.", "NTA", "NTA you have the right to choose what should happen to your kids just in case the worst happens. Not wanting your kids raised by people you know wouldn\u2019t do things the way you wished isn\u2019t a bad thing. I didn\u2019t even bother considering my brothers as guardians and asked my sister because she and I are more similar and I felt the kids would be raised in a way that would be better for them. It\u2019s your choice and she already has 9 freaking kids to raise.", "This \u2b06\ufe0e. \"I don't want my kids to be numbers 10 and 11\" should really be all that needs to be said, if anything more than \"no thank you\" is required (which it is really not).\n\nETA So sorry for your loss, OP.", "This all started because I needed brother and BIL to come and sign papers to be executors of  a durable trust into which my state will devolve should I die while my children are still minors. I mentioned them needing to swing by my house our mutual way home. Brother is a lawyer and so was Husband (they met in law school and that's how we met). We got the paper work par taken care of. :)", "I'm not a lawyer, but obvs this needs to be evidenced in appropriate legal docs. Which might want to explicitly rule out sister being a guardian. I dunno - OP needs to talk to a lawyer.\n\nAlso, if you think that sister won't challenge in any circumstance, you're... an optimist. There's every likelihood of sister trying to challenge no matter what, to rescue two innocent lives from being brought up by godless sodomites rather than get a healthy dose of baby jesus.", "NTA X 100000000\n\nYou might be better off going LC with sister because if something does happen it sounds like she will do everything in her power to get her hands on your kids.", "Just to make everyone happy, hear her out and then say no. She'll have had her say, mum will be happy and you've got your own way, which, as the parent, is not something you should have to negotiate in any case.\n\nI don't do the religion thing but just the case as you've stated makes your brother and his partner the better bet. Your kids would be consumed in a family that already has nine children. Did I read that right?\n\nAs you said though, you're not planning on going anywhere anytime soon so to some extent, it's a moot point but you have to plan.\n\nNTA. Of course, NTA", "NTA. As the parent, it is your decision on who is best to care for your children if you have passed. Family members don\u2019t get to \u201cmake their case\u201d.  They get to accept your decision. If your sister and/or mother keep after you to hear sister out, tell them the decision is yours alone and it\u2019s not up for debate."]}
