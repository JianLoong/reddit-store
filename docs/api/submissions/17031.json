I don't think it really matters if this friend was male or female, if she is making time for everyone but you, there is a big problem,. especially if your saying you've only spent 121 time together once in the past year. That's absolutely wild. \n\nYes we all need time with friends and space away from our partners, but it shouldn't be to the extent you don't go on any dates with your partner.\n\nYou guys need to sit down and talk about what is going on and what needs to change.", "NTA. I have male friends but would never prioritize them over my husband.", "NTA. But y'all seem to have a serious communication issue", "NTA, I'm sorry but even if your wife's not cheating now, she is absolutely distancing herself from you.  I urge you two get counseling but also that you talk to a lawyer and start documenting everything because divorce is a very real possibility here and if you're not prepared, she will be.", "NTA She spent time and effort organising a trip to a winery with a friend but couldn't be bothered to arrange something with you? \n\nSounds like she isn't interested in spending any time with you. She could've just as easily arranged that trip to the winery with you. And she's making excuses to not go on dates with you. \n\nI'd ask her to have a serious conversation with you where your marriage is going. She acts like she's checked out of the relationship.", "NTA\n\nIt does not sound like you are upset she is hanging out with a male but that she is making time for other people and not you. I think it is time you sat down with your wife and asked if if she was happy in this relationship or if there is anything happening that is making her not want to spend time with you alone.", "NTA. How is this not a date? Sounds like a date.", "NTA but you definitely need to talk to her seriously about wanting more time together", "NTA  I would be upset too.", "NTA. I think if I were you I'd boldly tell her that you are not okay with her giving attention to another man when you can't get any attention from her. Remind her who she married and that you love her and she's hurting your marriage by prioritizing someone else. Use your kind words and communicate your feelings with respect, and if she's as devoted to your marriage as you are she will absolutely do everything in her power to put as much work in as you do.", "NTA - she\u2019s putting the male \u2018friend\u2019 before you. Why are you not invited to go too? Sounds a little sketchy.", "NTA\n\nif she isn\u2019t cheating now then she is more than halfway already there! \n\nI am sorry for what you are going through", "NTA. She has checked out of your marriage.  Sorry, but it sounds like the only thing left to do is get a divorce.", "There\u2019s more to this story I\u2019d say.", "You\u2019re single buddy. NAH", "NTA\n\nIf she's not cheating yet, it's definitely going that way. When a woman has male friends it doesn't mean she goes on 1:1 drinks with them... except maybe if it's a special occasion (someone visiting from far away she hasn't seen in a long time).\n\nHowever what your wife is doing is far more. That's not going out for drinks.. taking a winery tour is several hours, it includes getting drunk.  it's quite the date there. \n\nHad she been seeing this \"male friend\" a lot lately?\n\nSorry for you :( \n\nYou should start preparing for the divorce, make sure you have your papers in order so you can at least get 50-50 custody of your child..  worst case in this situation is that she dumps you and manages to get full custody too...", "NAH. You're not wrong to be upset but asking her to cancel the plans (assuming that you don't have reason to believe that they're more than friends) would be wrong and besides the point. She has a right to get out and leaving a child with their parent is a lot more seamless than leaving a child with a babysitter (or it should be, anyway). It was also a thick-headed move on your part to ask her to plan and arrange childcare for date night when you're the one who wants it. It sounds like you're overdue for a conversation about why couple time hasn't been a priority. As a general rule, it's worth considering whether you have been fully pulling your weight as a co-parent and domestic partner before asking her to pour more into your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My parents are a mile down the road and are very willing to babysit, so there really is no complication with getting a babysitter.
