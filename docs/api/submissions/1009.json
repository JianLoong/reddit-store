Obviously your sister is 100% in the wrong here and deserves nothing from you, but I think you have to take a long hard look at your parents' involvement too. No responsible parent would let a 12-year-old have any parenting duties over their nieces and nephews at all. No responsible parent would let their daughter just pass her kids on to her younger sibling and then make excuses for why she gets to do that without even being called out for it.
