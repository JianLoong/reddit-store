Up here in Canada that kind of open bar thing is illegal for a reason. Binge drinking is alcohol abuse, which leads to alcohol dependence, so that's prob the real issue here.

And everyone in the comments asking if she was acting intoxicated makes me think they don't consume much alcohol because the affects would not take place that quickly.

That\u2019s 5 drinks and at that pace I\u2019d be pretty drunk. People are also asking \u201cwere the drinks watered down\u201d but as someone who bartended for six years I\u2019d say let\u2019s trust the bartenders judgement on this one. I was never looking to cut people off unless they clearly had to be, and if I knew the drinks were weak, which they never were because you\u2019re supposed to follow standard pouring, then I\u2019d still be able to figure out the line where it\u2019s appropriate to cut off. Bartenders are legally responsible for making these judgements; it\u2019d be different if OP were the one who was like \u201cthat\u2019s enough,\u201d but he wasn\u2019t; the bartender made the call and I\u2019m choosing to trust that it was a well reasoned one based on my own experience in the field. After 15 minutes she wouldn\u2019t be exhibiting signs of being extremely drunk, but give it another 15-30 and she\u2019d start. Bartenders know this and see it everyday.

One Long Island Iced Tea is more than 4 standard drinks when measured out correctly and usually much higher when free poured and it's unlikely that drinking one in 15mins will get you cut off. A single cocktail might have more alcohol than 3-4 light beers but we just perceive the latter to be binge drinking whilst the former is unlikely to be viewed the same despite the alcohol content being potentially higher. The number of drinks she had doesn't matter nearly as much as the number of standard drinks. I wouldn't cut off someone for having a cocktail in 15mins so I don't see why I should cut someone off for having the equivalent in beers, mixed drinks etc. the same amount of time. And your math is way off.
