Either way, you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have given the bartender or her any kind of look because that\u2019s patronizing. Also, if you had an issue with it, you shouldn\u2019t of brought it up to her when she was intoxicated.\n\nEDITED to add more explanation\n\nMy main problem is how he handled his wife. As an adult you communicate to your partner. We don\u2019t know what intentions they had as far as how many drinks to have. We don\u2019t know if this was genuinely accurate information regarding the \u201c3-4 drinks in 15 minutes\u201d. OP could definitely be exaggerating. Is it a crappy bar that says it\u2019s open bar and unlimited but serves super weak drinks to offset the \u201cunlimited\u201d drinks? We don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat we do know is he didn\u2019t respect her and talk to her. He patronized her. If I were in her shoes, and my husband side eyed the bartender in a \u201cwink nod\u201d fashion about me- but not communicate WITH me- that alone would make me mad. Maybe if he had handled it better and talked to her she would have been receptive and backed off. THAT is what makes him an asshole in my opinion.\n\nI\u2019m not saying she couldn\u2019t have overdone it- I\u2019m bothered how he handled it with her. I think that\u2019s what bothers me the most.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know if this behavior is common for her, if she is truly an alcoholic\u2026 we don\u2019t know. If she were and he knew she had this problem then he\u2019s the asshole for going to an open bar.", "NTA. You are allowed to have emotions. You did not make a scene. Next move is to have a conversation about it.", "NTA. She said herself she was trying to get her moneys worth out of the open bar. The establishment has to protect themselves & their patrons.", "Other than drinking too much you didn\u2019t describe anything she did that was inappropriate. \n\nFor that YTA", "YTA - so she drank some watered down drinks on a night out that was supposed to be about her and a celebration. You don\u2019t describe her as being drunk, rude, passing out, etc. or anything.", "YTA for saying she was embarrassing, but she was cut off for getting too drunk too fast.  In my state, bars and servers can be held responsible if someone too intoxicated keeps being over served.  At her age she should know how to work an open bar.", "I don't think you are a AH, but think you should have waited to talk to her when she wasn't drunk and maybe could have had a more adult talk about \u2728", "ESH.\n\nThe wife for not drinking responsibility. I understand she's out celebrating and it is an open bar. but it should not mean that she should worry the company she's with (regardless of gender or he was her husband) and putting the bartender in a tough position (he's legally responsible to make a judgment call on his patrons if he can serve further when it's risky). And everyone in the comments asking if she was acting intoxicated makes me think they don't consume much alcohol because the affects would not take place that quickly. And given the fact that if continued to be served, she could be in at least 5-6 drinks in by the time intoxication physically started showing up. By the time she could be facing medical emergency. (Alcoholic Beverage Control suggests one standart drink per hour btw) \n\nThe bartender for saying open hour ended when it clearly wasn't. It would clearly upset a customer who didn't know his liability if someone got alcohol poisoning by drinks he served. Although he's the least at fault in this story still.\n\nFinally the husband, OP, for how he handled it. 3-4 drinks must have started hitting her at the time of the conversation and I don't think it's the best time to call her actions embarrassing while she's probably already embarrassed, upset and quite possibly drunk. The conversation could take place the next day with more understanding and gently even if you thought she was at fault.", "NTA. If your wife wanted to get drunk fast she should have just ordered shots.", "I get it - I went on a cruise and my friend was ordering her second round by the time I\u2019d finished telling the bartender what I wanted for my first. She was knocking drinks back so quickly that they proactively reminded us that water bottles were also included in our drink package. It was uncomfortable because she was obviously on track to drink too much and as much as she could possibly get in and the staff was looking at me because they didn\u2019t want to make her angry. I ended up suggesting we go check out whether our rooms were ready so that she\u2019d have to take an break and sure enough, she went to sleep/passed out as soon as we got there. Problem solved (at least temporarily).\n\nBut you didn\u2019t handle this well.

If you are going to troll, at least try and be believable. Saying you don't drink, after initially calling OP a \"party pooper.\" \n\nI'll never understand you trolls. I mean, what is it you find fun about this? I can't imagine how empty and pathetic one's life would have to be, to find pleasure in creating conflict and attempting to make people miserable.", "Men (generally) have more ADH, which allows faster oxidation of ethanol- so lean mass, pound for pound they can drink more but I do agree lean mass is a better deterministic metric", "Men and women process alcohol at different rates. This is taught in all bar safety classes", "U have an alcohol problem, and blacking out doesn't count as \"fine\", lol.", "No you haven\u2019t.", "Fuck off Rebeccah, that didn\u2019t happen. \nYour point is somewhat valid about tolerance, but a 200lb man won\u2019t be able to down a shot every 30 sec 10 times and be standing upright.", "Very much true. but because one mistake was made doesn\u2019t mean you need to make a second.", "Exactly. That\u2019s like saying \u201cI let my wife get hit by a train instead of pulling her off the tracks because she\u2019s a grown woman and I didn\u2019t want to take away her right to find out if she could survive the impact.\u201d There is a big, big gap between being controlling and being responsible.", "I\u2019d argue that 4 drinks in 15 minutes and aiming for more is a significantly less healthy way of life.", "Dude that behavior is gross and she she shouldn\u2019t slam four drinks in 15 minutes. Also the bartender and establishment can get in trouble for over serving like that.", "Evidence: 3-4 drinks in 15 minutes is always sloppy, you just don't see it for about 35 minutes.", "\nLotta people who\u2019ve never worked in the service industry in this thread!", "Exactly. You exchange a look with whomever the drunk person is with to see if they're going to help you or make things worse\n\nI get that it's a more sensitive situation for women because we're regularly condescended to, but that doesn't make this a gender-specific scenario", "Oops first time replying and posted a new comment", "No.  I go to a fair amount of all you can drink brunches and the pitcher they pour the mimosas from are certainly less potent than one made at the bar.  They are still plenty boozy\u2026 but not as strong.", "Eh, it depends. As long as there's not actually serving watered down alcohol *directly from the bar* it's not usually a problem. It's usually just an extremely weak mixed drink/cocktail with  not a lot of alcohol content in the same way a chain restaurant like Applebee's does $1 cocktails in the latter half of every year.", "That's literally chugging a drink every 4 minutes. Definitely excessive", "Agreed. I\u2019m someone who likes to drink \u2014 to the point that I sometimes struggle with my relationship to alcohol, even \u2014 but that\u2019s completely insane and something I would never ever do. I would expect my partner to be very worried about me if I downed 4 drinks in 15 minutes.", "Meh.  It depends on the drink.  Is it a tall Jack and Coke or a dainty martini or cosmo.   Plus often these AYCD schemes often serve watered drinks.  \n\nI\u2019ve been to a fair amount of promotions and bar passing parties.  Usually the guest of honor is so on a high they are extra celebratory!", "Spend anytime at a bar right by a military base, that is nothing. \nSounds like OP is an AH, Buzz Killington AND a spoiled child.", "Perhaps don't start your comment that way if you want people to bother carry on reading. \n\nTry insulting them at the end instead.", "What does not drinking have to do with being a part pooper?

It just might be a better choice to take it home and deal with it in a safe environment that didn't involve any potential embarrassing drunken scenes, public fights for all parties involved.\n\nHave lots of emotion and experience on this one.  \n\nTeam, less alcohol... especially when having to be supporting the person drinking.", "I mean without knowing the size of the drinks and her state it\u2019s hard to say. \nThere is no indication in ops post that her behavior was inappropriate, except for downing drinks too fast.\nBartender likely did the right thing cutting her off as alcohol takes some time to hit. But i don\u2019t think she was necessarily embarrassing\n\nTbf if OP can\u2019t remember if it was 3 or 4 drinks, how sure are we that it was in fact 15 min?", "Ya. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. *shifty eyes*", "I didn't start my comment that way. It was at the end of my first defining paragraph that led to more insightful reasoning in those that followed. You still haven't given any thoughts on those.\n\nWhy are you feeling so victomized?", "No, that\u2019s actually the call of bar staff. And it\u2019s true; men have larger builds and more lean muscle mass.", "Certainly not, but a lot of people seem to think the bartender made his choice based on OP\u2019s \u201clook\u201d instead of his own training and experience.", "It\u2019s not hard to say. \n\nThere\u2019s no world where 4 drinks in 15 minutes isn\u2019t excessive. \n\nA 120 pound woman after four drinks is at least at a .12 BAC, once the alcohol gets into her system. She\u2019s going to be visibly intoxicated unless she\u2019s a heavy drinker. It\u2019s going to take 6-7 hours without drinking to begin to approach a sober state.", "It's just goading, they're not here to make any good points. Don't bother arguing, they're not actually reading what you say.", "Thank god I'm in the UK and I don't have to deal with nonsense like that.", "Fair enough. I'm more worried about the people who are arguing that the wife should've been allowed to keep drinking.

Sounds like a recipe for disaster.", "Sweet Jesus! thats horrifying", "Holy crap. Glad you dumped him. Wtf?", "Ngl, I'm simultaneously horrified for you and really wish I'd been there to see it.
