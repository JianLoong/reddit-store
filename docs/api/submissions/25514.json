I'm sorry your sisters had to leave their home but since no one else could provide them with one, you came through and saved the day.  It may be years before they understand that, but I assure you that you did the right thing.", "NTA and whatever family you have making those comments are AHs, it's not your fault you live that far it was an inheritance thing, and regardless if they can't take them in then they need to shut up.", "NTA. If they want your sisters closer, why couldn\u2019t they take them in? Whether they like it or not you have to do what you have to do in order to support them as part of your family. It will suck for your sisters for a bit but hopefully they appreciate it when they\u2019re a bit older.", "NTA - this is what\u2019s best for the children. 17f doesn\u2019t have the foresight to understand. But the family members who are too indigent to take them on should understand. Either way, you\u2019re doing a great job and keep your head up.", "NTA. 17 y.o. doesn't yet understand that you are actually doing a huge favor to them, it's either move further away or go into foster care. Your family, from the sound of it, is completely irresponsible if the best possible guardian is a 24 y.o. sibling, and not one of the parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, or any other older relative that are supposed to be more established in life and have more resources.", "NTA, what were you supposed to do, relocate five people for the sake of three children that nobody in their hometown could support? I don't see them buying you a house. You got custody presumably because you're more stable, and part of that stability is where you live. The kids will get over it. Sucks that someone else put them in that position, but it's not your fault. You're cleaning up after adults at a very young age yourself and their criticism should go right where it deserves to go: in the garbage.", "Sometimes life sucks, particularly when you're a teen. You're doing your best. NTA", "NTA. Whatever is the reason you had to get custody of them I'm sure it's not sunshine and rainbows. It's a tough situation and you had to make a decision as the adult in charge, for what I read you can afford to take them in and provide a nice stable home thanks to the job and the conditions in the city you live in, conditions that you wouldn't have in their home town. Risking the stability so they could stay there would have been extremely irresponsible. But you do need to acknowledge their feelings, how hard it's to move, to change schools, leave friends and family behind, everything they're feeling is normal, so talk to them, show them empathy maybe the school therapist can help them deal with all the changes in their life in a better way than seeing you like the evil person who took them away. And ignore or block the rest of the family, if they couldn't or wouldn't take them all in and give them a good life then they can keep their opinions and complains to themselves.", "NTA. \n\nNone of the family that is calling you were willing of able to take them. Stop letting them give you grief. \n\nYou need to have a long conversation with 17 about what\u2019s going on, why you moved them there, and her being ungrateful for taking her in is not appreciated. The parents lost custody for a reason, comparing her new situation to being worse than what got her taken away is very unfair to you and your family.\n\nThey should be old enough to understand. When they are old enough and stable, they can move back if they want so bad. \n\nI recommend counselling for everyone involved. Huge change for your siblings and home life in general.", "YTA you talked to your wife about it, when its your sisters you shouldve talked with. \n\nAlso, how come you inherited a house so far away?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re doing a great thing.  Sometimes kids have to move, and sometimes they\u2019re very upset about it.  They\u2019ll thank you later.  You sound like a very generous person \u2764\ufe0f", "17 years old should be getting ready for college.  Good job taking care of your family.  6 kids when you are barely legal is overwhelming.  If 17 is so unhappy,  can she stay with one of these relatives who are outraged.", "NTA OP, Moving your siblings was the only option. You have a family of your own that you are responsible for. Moving to a place where you have no work could rapidly become a situation where all of you are homeless, which makes no sense at all. The 17 year old is not being realistic. In no way would it be possible for her to remain in her hometown and have a roof over her head. She needs to talk to a counselor and get a grip on reality.", "First off NTA.\n\nYour family is hysterically funny.\nLet me get this straight... This group of family members whom by themselves or collectively couldn't take a single child. Either they don't have the money, the space, or I bet DCF is already involved in their households. Those folks are mad at you because you were able to keep them together,( a feat in itself, good job OP) provide a home and because it isn't in their backyard their harassing you. \n\nThey aren't offering to buy a plane ticket back, they aren't taking advantage of free video call services. Those adults can't figure out a Greyhound bus ticket to visit you OP? But, they want you to foot the bill to buy a house close to them so that they can visit your siblings? \n\nOP throw the question back on them, ask them if DCF will approve their household so that the oldest one can go back to school? Ask them questions that would require their monetary involvement to solve and don't let up.\n\nEdit: For the near adult talk to her about your experience growing up be honest because she is nearly an adult. Ask her if there is another family member who would allow her to live with them and finish up her last year of school with her friends, this is a difficult time and she is old enough to be apart of the solution. If there is someone who would be safe enough think about sending her back to the hometown.", "**NTA**   Let the one of the relatives take in the 17-year old and look into some therapy for the younger kids.   If you the state has granted you custody, there should be resources to help the kids.", "NTA you are stuck in a shitty situation. You are the adult and are responsible for a huge family. It sucks, their teenagers, but if they don\u2019t want to go into foster care this is what they need to do. Eventually when their older and can understand housing costs, job markets, cost of living etc they\u2019ll understand why your couldn\u2019t just uproot your and your family\u2019s entire life. They will be mad. They\u2019ll also get over it. Fuck your family for just adding fuel to the fire though. They aren\u2019t stepping up so why tf do they get a say in anything. Good luck!", "The girls\u2019 options only options seem to be 1) live with you, or 2) group home and possibly separated from each other with no certainty that they would be reunited. \n\nIf extended family refused to take the girls in because they can\u2019t afford it, then they don\u2019t get to determine where they live if they want them to stick together. It\u2019s a no-win situation unless one of them in their old town steps up and takes them in and files for government assistance for financial support. The 17 year old could also get a part-time job and help support, but that\u2019s asking a lot for a legal child. NTA", "I did briefly talk to them about it and it was more they stay together with me or get separated and in foster care (which I didn\u2019t want I suffered 19 years of it) it\u2019s from my dads side of the family and my parents never married", "These are children. They are not owed voting rights. They are owed a conversation which OP never said they did not have. Only that they also cleared with their wife. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough situation and tough decisions have to be made for everyone not just a 17 yo who can leave when she\u2019s 18 anyway - if she hates it that much. There\u2019s literally 5 other children to care for.", "NTA.  You are very brave to take them on.  However, is there someone 17 yr old could stay with and graduate from her old school?  Having to move your senior year is ghastly.", "The 17 year old is - what, a senior in high school? If one of the relatives is willing to take her in for the school year, maybe offer to let *her* go back.\n\nThe other two will surely acclimate, but I can understand that it's upsetting to leave your school the last year, if you're happy there.\n\nOtherwise, NTA. In almost all circumstances it's better to keep siblings together, and it doesn't look like the rest of the family was finding a way to allow that to happen while also letting them stay where they already were - for example, by chipping in for their care.\n\nEdit: Oh, and be sure to look into getting a foster care stipend for caring for your siblings - and also look into therapy for them.", "YTA for moving a 17 yo for her senior year of high school!! Did you even check to see if another relative could take her in for that year if she preferred that option?!?!?! \n\nThe 14 and 12 yo will still have some difficulty, but they are young enough to start over someplace new, so I have less heartache over that, but My God! Senior Year?!?!? \n\nThe military forced us to do that to my Middle Son. We were returning to the US, so there was no legal way he could stay - it was freaking traumatic for him! I couldn't imagine doing that to a teenager if there were ANY other choice!!!", "NTA. How did they think you were going to support your siblings if you had to start over in your career? Were they going to help support all of you? Those who can't take your siblings need to keep their mouths shut.\n\nThe 17 year old is thinking of herself. The timing stinks regarding the move from her perspective, but hopefully she'll come around to realizing that you are doing your level best through a tremendous level of responsibility.", "Nta, but clearly, they need therapy. They have gone through a lot. Get 17 into therapy asap. She's likely the ring leader and the most pressing concern for getting on a good track. Get all 3 sisters in therapy individually and in family therapy (perhaps start with you and them or you, wife and them).individual therapy for you might also be a good idea to support you through this transition.\n\nSee what resources the state can offer. Maybe put them in some kind of group therapy aimed at their situation.\n\nFigure out a healthy way for them to stay in contact with old friends (perhaps they can each have a friend come visit). Figure out how to help them integrate where you live - activities, etc, to make friends, letting new friends come over.\n\nLook at parenting books for teens, check the library, and they will have lots of options.\n\nDon't fall into the trap of squabbling with your sisters ( that sibling dynamic). You are their parent now. Obvs, you still can be fun, but you will have to draw new boundaries (and manage your own behaviour). There are definitely aspects of the sibling dynamic that you can't have right now (or maybe ever again). If you find yourself falling into old behaviours, take a deep breath,  take a step back, and start again. Maybe ask your spouse to (gently,  privately) point out when and in what ways you act like the sibling, not the parent (when the parent is needed).\n\nBe consistent. Be calm.", "Exactly what would the parameters of such a discussion have been?  Would the OP give them the choice of being in separate foster homes or...?   These are children, they don't get to dictate anything to the OP.\n\nAnd as far as the inherited home is concerned, what difference does it make?   He had a way out, they didn't and he chose to throw a ladder to them.", "At this point I have talked to all of the relatives and their case worker who won\u2019t let the 17 year old leave as the other relatives aren\u2019t even considered a possibility due to their situations financially and other reasons (Also I\u2019m Canadian)"]}
