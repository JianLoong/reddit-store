She is in the wrong for giving an unsolicited opinion about your relationship with your mother. I imagine it is because on some level she resents the fact that her relationship with her mother is strained.\n\nThe two places where you erred (although neither make you an asshole) is that you should have respectfully set a boundary the first time\nshe commented on your relationship to eliminate that behaviour. The second is that you responded using the same line of thinking that Emily used, which is hypocritical. However, I completely understand you were initially trying to maintain peace and in this incident you simply had had enough and reached your typing point. Your actions were justifiable, but in future try a different approach that would be more effective and not drag you down to a lower standard of decorum.\n\nIt is categorically hypocrisy for Emily and Kate to chastize you for overstepping and ignore the fact that this started because Emily overstepped. I would encourage you to have a conversation about this and bring this up. Hopefully this could become a discussion about boundaries and how to restore a harmonious environment in your home together. Ideally this could be a convenient time to air out all grievances so everyone walks away resentment-free.\n\nThe most disappointing person here is Kate because she had the opportunity to approach the situation with neutrality and she could have easily deescalated the situation by hearing both sides and negotiating a resolution. If she does not have the personality or interest in doing so, she had the choice to not get involved and recuse herself. Instead, she made the most incendiary choice and chose a side based on a reason that is pure hypocrisy. Her bias towards one roommate and then deciding to get involved says a lot about her character and how much you can trust her. The fact that she did not see the inherent hypocrisy in her reprimanding you suggests that she is not particularly self-aware, a terrible mediator, and/or willingly ignorant to manipulate _the_ truth into _my_ truth. I would be extremely cautious around her because she seems like the type of person who would retaliate if ever scorned, but you would never see it coming because she hides behind a mask. Hopefully I am wrong and she is not that malicious, but her response to the situation was indicative of someone who enjoys conflict and conflict escalation.", "NTA .\n\nEmily should mind her business.

It took me a while to realize they were just jealous because they weren\u2019t as openly loved as my parents love me. Crazy we\u2019re not the only ones to experience this!", "Why does that mean she should have the right to comment on whether OP and her mum's relationship is healthy? That has nothing to do with it.", "I have this issue with sibling relationships; there are lot of posts on here about a SO being weirded out by how close some siblings are (physically or emotionally) and I always identified with the SO in those situations, because my sibs and I are just not close at all and that\u2019s what feels normal to me. (those AITA posts were actually really helpful in exposing me to other attitudes on sibling relationships and helping me decouple my knee-jerk discomfort from making an actual judgment. Thanks guys!)\n\nI think the difference between what you described and what I often feel is that we recognize it\u2019s a \u201cme\u201d problem; it\u2019s something individual to us, and projecting it onto other people is wildly inappropriate and AH behavior. Emily isn\u2019t doing that.", "Emily is definitely TA here for how she treated OP, but blaming her for not improving her relationship with her mom is uncalled for. \u201cShe could easily use that energy to [improve their relationship]\u201d? Not necessarily.", "You're  very fortunate  to have such a wonderful  relationship  with your family.  Enjoy it every day.\n\nI'm kind of jealous.   I have great siblings,  but we aren't close", "I have that as well, a brief hug is the most physical contact I ever have had with my brother or father for that matter. Yes, it is a \"me\" problem, but I think knowing that is wisdom that comes with age.", "I am very lucky and I appreciate every second I have with them.  I also had the most amazing grandparents and cousins and just the whole family is awesome.  I wouldn't trade them for anything in the whole world", "I'm not sure where you're getting this \"talk all day\", \"call three times a day\" bullshit. Nobody said that. OP and I both said we talk to our moms everyday. Doesn't say all day. I already asked you once where it says that. Talking ALL DAY is unhealthy for any relationship. Talking to your parents once day or even twice a day doesn't mean you're breastfeeding, it means you have a healthy relationship with your parents. God, I'm sorry, I forgot how difficult it is to speak to people that don't have a brain. I'm gonna go call my mom! :)", "Your series of comments are completely ignorant. Your culture is not the only one in the world. People can have various types of relationships with their parents. Just because you don\u2019t talk to your parents, don\u2019t mean others can\u2019t.", "When you do, just know she\u2019s eternally disappointed because you\u2019re still super dependent and she wanted to raise you better than that.", "They sure can! Doesn\u2019t mean that one way isn\u2019t more appropriate than the other. I talk to my parents. I just don\u2019t call mommy every time I scratch an itch or take a sip of water. I once dumped a giantbrownguy for his mommy issues, couldn\u2019t even go to the grocery store without him calling to ask her what aisle the cheese was in, creepy as hell. Was that you?!", "NTA. Both our kids call my husband & I daily.  Our calls are just like yours with your mom. Just calls about daily life. I call my mom once a month or so. As they said every relationship is different. Why is her relationship ok but there\u2019s a problem with yours?  Keep calling your mother. I\u2019m sure that she appreciates it.", "I think it\u2019s fantastic that you have a wonderful relationship with your mother, and you should not care what people have to say about your phone calls. For future reference, if someone teases you about your calls, just tell them you love your mom, or better yet, do they want to chat with her. My friends sure loved to talk to my mom. \n\nAs for Emily, she was a jerk for her comment, but you may have hit too close to home with your mommy issue comment. To clear the air have a sit down with Emily and remember, you are one of the lucky ones to have a great mom.", "NAH. You both have issues, but they are diametrically opposed. And you\u2019re both too inexperienced to realise it.", "NTA. Who you call is none of Emily\u2019s business. If she wants to comment on your personal life, she shouldn\u2019t be surprised or offended if you return the favour.", "NTA - I\u2019m 45 and talk to my parents a few times a day. Mostly thru text with funny memes or stuff like that but, we still chat daily. Your roommate definitely has issues. What does it matter if you talk to your mom daily? It doesn\u2019t affect her and is none of her business.", "Err, why is it ok for her to say you have mummy issues, but not ok for you to say she has? Thats just weird and illogical, all else aside.", "Yeah, I kind of get where Emily is coming from. My mom disowned me in my early 20s for being bisexual. We're now at the point where we write each other letters every few months, but even that took the better part of a decade. When I used to tell people that I'm estranged from my mom, the amount of people who acted like there must be something inherently wrong with me was out of this world. I actually had a therapist say to me, \"how could anyone love you if your own mother doesn't even love you?\" People are getting better about understanding that family dynamics are weird and parents are shitty, but there's still a group of people that cannot seem to grasp the idea that not all families are these cohesive, unconditionally loving units. \n\nEmily is shitty, but she may also be projecting as a defense mechanism.", ">That's reading a lot into it. If you don't talk every day to your parents, it's weird when people do.\n\nYou're forgetting OP's roommate went out of her way multiple times to tell her that something is wrong with her for calling her mom once a day, so yeah it reads like classic projection. It has nothing to do with you being independent. If you went around claiming everyone who lives life differently from you has emotional issue/damage people are going to assume you have some sort of insecurity you're dealing with.\n\n When OP brought up how Emily doesn't talk to her parents, Emily didn't start talking about independent she naturally is and that's why she rarely contacts them, or explain that in any way. She just got immediately offended and stormed off. That doesn't read like you're confident in your own choices. Especially tied in with her need to convince others something is wrong with them for not living life the way she does, which is why this situation even happened period.", "You can like people and not talk to them every day. You can like people and not talk to them every month. For many reasons, most of them fairly benign, like some people just don't like talking on the phone (or video chatting; I really loathe video chatting and will not do it socially.) \n\nMy point was people have different relationships with different communication styles with their parents and most of them are perfectly healthy even if they're different from your own. And it's normal (although obnoxious) for people in college to be weirded out by close exposure to family dynamics significantly different than theirs. It's also normal (although obnoxious) for college students to say things they really shouldn't and need to be called out on it.", "They're freshmen in college it sounds like. They're still working their stuff out, so they're going to over comment and get weirded out by relatively normal things and run their mouths. It's part of the process (as is getting the kind of feedback the roommate got because yeah, she was being rude.)\n\nAnd I'm not saying Emily's reasoning was independence; it was just my reasoning as an example. People can have many benign reasons why they don't call their parents every day."]}
