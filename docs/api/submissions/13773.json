I can\u2019t imagine going three months without talking to my parents.\nYour room is the AH and should keep her nose out of your business and not comment.", "I think that\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m glad you had that kind of relationship. I always wished I had that but I wouldn\u2019t begrudge anyone else having such a great bond with their Mother. I think OP\u2019s friend is jealous.", "I would find it odd in an older person, if someone over 30 was calling their mother every day for example. Barring medical issues or other problems, calling your parents every day as a grown adult shows an unhealthy level of enmeshment IMO \n\nIf OP is living alone for the first time, it's more understandable. I guess it isn't right or wrong, more dependent on personality and family culture.\n\nI called my mother once or twice a month when I was that age, neither of us would have wanted daily calls and we have a very good relationship.", "I don't think is necessarily jealousy. If you grow up without close family relations then close family relations seem strange. I know because that's me. My father was never affectionate so I don't see physical affection as anything but sexual. I know rationally that there isn't anything sexual in a father being affectionate but I have to keep telling myself that it isn't because of my upbringing. And I only call my mother once a month and see her about 2 times a year and I don't understand why anyone would want to talk to their parents every day.", "Why is it any more unhealthy than having a best friend you talk to daily? When you care about people, you enjoy talking to them and spending time with them, like your friends or the person your dating. Why is it weird to have that relationship with your parents as well? \n\nI mean, I kind of think it's weird too lol but I'm wondering why should it be?", "Dont think that gives Emily the right to make comments (which the OP clearly finds uncomfortable) about OPs relationship with her mother.", "That's honestly kind of sad. You would hope that after 18 years together you would have at least a friendly relationship with your parents (as long as they weren't abusive or neglectful of course). Out of curiosity why wouldn't you be ok with your partner talking to their parents everyday?", "The gospel according to you:\n\n>I absolutely do not think\n\n> I think\n\nThen ironically:\n>I\u2019m not bashing anyone\n\nYet again:\n>I don\u2019t give a crap\n\nNow I am confused:\n>I know that if my SO \n\nCos who cares about you or your SO?

People get fucking weird about mother and son relationships on AITA.", "NTA I talk to my mom on the phone for at least 30mins every day, sometimes an hour. It's worth having those memories later.\n\nOoh you have a good relationship with your mum, how is anyone mad about that? It's not anybody's business. If you lived at home, you'd probably talk to your parents even more. It's a way to make up for that time imo.", "I honestly find it odd that people who have shitty parents growing up and end up with psychological scars from it are labelled as having mommy or daddy issues as if its their fault that their parents don't love them.", "NTA daughters/mothers who don\u2019t have a close/healthy relationship with theres do t usually understand the closeness and friendship of good mother/daughter relationships. She isn\u2019t close with her family which is ok. You are close to yours that\u2019s also ok.", "NTA. Emily started overstepping. Eventually you ran out of patience and clapped back at her. She is in the wrong for giving an unsolicited opinion about your relationship with your mother. I imagine it is because on some level she resents the fact that her relationship with her mother is strained.\n\nThe two places where you erred (although neither make you an asshole) is that you should have respectfully set a boundary the first time\nshe commented on your relationship to eliminate that behaviour. The second is that you responded using the same line of thinking that Emily used, which is hypocritical. However, I completely understand you were initially trying to maintain peace and in this incident you simply had had enough and reached your typing point. Your actions were justifiable, but in future try a different approach that would be more effective and not drag you down to a lower standard of decorum.\n\nIt is categorically hypocrisy for Emily and Kate to chastize you for overstepping and ignore the fact that this started because Emily overstepped. I would encourage you to have a conversation about this and bring this up. Hopefully this could become a discussion about boundaries and how to restore a harmonious environment in your home together. Ideally this could be a convenient time to air out all grievances so everyone walks away resentment-free.\n\nThe most disappointing person here is Kate because she had the opportunity to approach the situation with neutrality and she could have easily deescalated the situation by hearing both sides and negotiating a resolution. If she does not have the personality or interest in doing so, she had the choice to not get involved and recuse herself. Instead, she made the most incendiary choice and chose a side based on a reason that is pure hypocrisy. Her bias towards one roommate and then deciding to get involved says a lot about her character and how much you can trust her. The fact that she did not see the inherent hypocrisy in her reprimanding you suggests that she is not particularly self-aware, a terrible mediator, and/or willingly ignorant to manipulate _the_ truth into _my_ truth. I would be extremely cautious around her because she seems like the type of person who would retaliate if ever scorned, but you would never see it coming because she hides behind a mask. Hopefully I am wrong and she is not that malicious, but her response to the situation was indicative of someone who enjoys conflict and conflict escalation.", "NTA .\n\nEmily should mind her business. If people can indeed have different relationships with their parents which is true what gives her the right to criticise yours.\n\nAlso my mother and I have had a difficult relationship over the years to the point where I considered going low to no contact with her at one point but over the past year it\u2019s gotten a lot better and we speak almost everyday. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a testament to how far we\u2019ve come and not weird at all.", "NTA. She started in on your relationship with your mother, which makes her relationship with her mother fair game in my book. Why is it fine for her to pick on you for talking to your mum, but not fine for you to say something about her not talking to her mum? Double standards.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have opened her mouth about it if she knew she couldn\u2019t handle getting clapped back.", "NTA!", "ESH. Everyone does have different relationships with their parents. And neither if you has any business commenting on it", "NTA.", "NTA. Why is Emily allowed to comment on your relationship with your mother, but you can\u2019t comment on her relationship with hers? Either something is missing here or your roommates are ganging up on you. Anything more gets said about you calling your mom - respond with \u201cAs you mentioned, people can have different relationships with their parents.\u201d And keep saying it.", "NTA so you over stepped because people have different relationships with their parents. But wait isnt that EXACTLY what emily was doing. They need to take their own advice and stop being hypocrites. \n\nAsk why its OK for Emily to speak up about your relationship with your mam but not OK when you do the same. Show them their hypocrisy and stand your ground. Boundaries are that none of you talk or disrespect each other parental relationships. \n\nMy son and I have a great relationship and talk like you and your mom do. Or not if we busy. Don't let other ruin that or be jealous of it.", "NTA. Please ask them why it's ok for Emily to imply you have issues but when you make the same point and support it appropriately, that's wrong? Also the comment about people having different relationships with their parents.... yes. You have a close one that's none of Emily's business. \nHow does you speak to your mother affect Emily daily?? It doesn't. Why does she even care?\n\nJFC the entitlement of some people.", "NTA. So it is okay to not only comment on, but actually insult you over your relationship with your mother - by the way, congratulation you have a loving relationship with your mother - but it's all overstepping when you counter with the exact same comment, only that it's at least based on actual notice? Emily and Kate sound like AHs.", "NTA well apparently you cant have a different relationship with parents then other people or she wouldn't be commenting on yours.", "NTA are you having all these conversations loudly in communal spaces and dominating those spaces? Because that can be too much. As if you are constantly having your mother over all the time.", "NTA. If she can't take it, she shouldn't dish it out.", "NTA, but you are the one with mommy issues.", "I'm terrible at keeping in touch with anyone and hate speaking on the phone, so usually speak to my parents 2-3 times a month and talking to anyone multiple times a day would be weird and stressful for me; but isn't that the delightful thing about our big spectrum of human differences?  \nShe could have talked about your differences in a curious way but she chose to be mean and I can see why you were upset and mean back but if you genuinely think that about her then pithy comebacks is maybe not the way to go, very gentle ESH.", "They\u2019re accusing you of doing the EXACT same thing Emily just did! Hypocrisy at its finest! Everybody just needs to stay in their lane. As kate says everyone has different relationships with their parents \n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nI think both people were out of line to throw jabs at each other's relationships with their moms, both approaches are valid. I know OP was on the defensive, but she hasn't said she was wrong to make that comment.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see how you overstepped when you basically repeated her observation back to her and put it on her instead. it sounds like she was projecting and therefore you hit too close to home from the way she and Kate are reacting.", "NTA. She can dish it out but can't take it? That's sad", "Info: does ur apartment have thin walls? Does she have to listen to ur phone ringing constantly or u constantly talking to ur mother? Or does this happen in the common area where they might wanna study? If so, YTA.\n\nIf not, NTA.", "NTA. She opened that particular can of worms.", "NTA. I have mommy issues and love that I go years between seeing her and months without talking-she\u2019s a crazy crack head to put it mildly. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re close with your mom and it doesn\u2019t sound suffocating. I would be suffocated if mom tried that crap, so your friend is likely projecting.", "NTA their complaint cuts both ways.", "NTA, the relationship you have with your mom is the same as mine. I had my ring tone as  stewie from family  guy saying 'mom' in her phone too. Enjoy that time, ignore Emily. When I lost my mom, it hurt, but I was happy that we spent time & talked every day.", "NTA. I call my mom almost everyday!", "ESH. It\u2019s like the posts where one friend says, \u201cyou\u2019re such a twig, you can eat anything and look great\u201d and the other says \u201chey fatty, you\u2019re just jealous.\u201d No one should be commenting one way or the other, but there are still different weights to the comments. She definitely did tease you about being a mama\u2019s girl, but that seems generally benign. Your comment hit harder because her situation is worse. You chat with your mom a lot vs. your family doesn\u2019t love you is about the same topic, but they\u2019re not at the same severity. She started the fight, but you fought a kitchen fire with a flamethrower.", "Op, your relationship with your Mom reminds me of mine. We talked several times a day until the day she died. It's not unhealthy to have a friendship with your mom once you're an adult. It's  lovely. Please treasure yours.", "NTA. She may not happy with her situation with her Mom and jealous of yours. Or she simply may not understand it. I don't have a relationship with mine but I do have a relative who's like a Mom who I'd speak to sometimes a few times a day, and I'm 36! Totally normal.", "ESH", "NTA. My mom is 83 and my sister and I both talk to her at least once a day. Sometimes more than once. Now my relationship with my dad was another story. \nHaving had very different relationships with each parent lets me understand both points of view. What it doesn't do is give me the right to comment on anyone else's relationship with their parents.", "Tbh I don\u2019t have a judgment here, but I do think it\u2019s a weird thing to say that someone has mommy issues just bcs they haven\u2019t spoken to their parents in 3 months. Maybe I\u2019m just distant from my family \ud83e\udd14", "Yeah ''the norm'' is that most children have a not so great relationship with their parents. So we should put everyone under that norm? \n\nA partner who'd have issues with you having a good relationship with your parents likely doesn't have many good qualities anyway.", "I only rarely speak to my family besides text and we are still pretty close. My husband always facedtimed his family everyday, and they are equally close. Would I want that to myself? No. But it's not strange, if anything it's a reflection of my family being a bunch of introverts and his family being the opposite - they love chatting away. Maybe people should mind their own business and not criticising others just because they're different?... \n\nOP, NTA", "Wow, so everyone should have exactly the same relationship with their mom as you do or they're weird? Good to know.", "Had? My mom and I also have that relationship. It\u2019s pretty rare that we don\u2019t talk at least twice a day. I am terrified at the thought of losing her or that someday", "Totally agree!", "Yeah same here. I'd run out of stuff to talk about pretty fast if I called or texted every week, let alone every day. Yep, still working away, doin my hobbies, still healthy, till happily single. And we don't have any shared interests.\n\nBut I am in my 40s, whereas OP is in her 20s, and probably low 20s if she's going to classes. And when I was in college I did go home on weekends, so we'd chat more often.", "That's obviously your mommy issues talking.(/s)", "I think it depends on the nature of the relationship as well. If it is more like two friends who happen to be related talking to each other about their lives, that's fine. As long as the son/daughter is still independent and its not a case of an overbearing mother(or father) trying to be too controlling.", "In your opinion, whats the normal amount a grown adult (who lives on their own) should keep in contact with their parents? Once a month? A few times a year? Do you even like your parents? Just curious....", "NTA. I hate that this is so common, and I experienced it at your age. She wants her experience to be the default. \"Oh everyone doesn't talk to their parents, thats just normal, nothing to do with me or my parents\" \n\nYou are proof she is wrong. She hates that and wants you to be wrong.", ">That's honestly kind of sad. You would hope that after 18 years together you would have at least a friendly relationship with your parents \n\nI have friendly relationships with my parents, and my siblings and friends, but I don't spend 30 minutes on the phone with them everyday.\n\nGranted that's partly because my life has gotten very routine, so there's not as much to chat about. Had a lot more when I first went to college, talking about classes, figuring out how to (barely) look after myself on my own in my college dorm, etc.\n\nShared interests also matter. I can still talk to my dad about politics and the shows we both watch, but I've zero overlapping interests with my mom."]}
