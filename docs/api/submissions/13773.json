We\u2019re all 20sF. The conflict is mainly between Emily and me.  \n\nSo, for context, my mom and I call each other everyday, and usually a couple times a day. It\u2019s nothing major, I call her when I\u2019m walking back from one of my classes, she calls me when she\u2019s making lunch, I call her before I go to bed, etc. The calls combined aren\u2019t ever more than 30 minutes and it\u2019s mainly just to check in with each other in our spare time. She doesn\u2019t go crazy if I don\u2019t call at all she just assumes I\u2019m busy and we text each other good night. \n\nMy roommate Emily always had something to say about it and I always brushed it off because she\u2019s also my friend so I just assume it was her being annoying for fun. \n\nAnyways, she tells me, \u201cit\u2019s really weird you still call your mom everyday. It\u2019s like you have some unresolved issues or something\u201d \n\nI look at her and point out she hasn\u2019t spoken to her parents at all since we\u2019ve been back in school from winter break and hasn\u2019t seen them in over 3 months. \n\nI say \u201cif anything you might have some mommy issues since you\u2019ve been ignoring her for 3 months now\u201d\n\nNow both her and Kate (who has always been closer to Emily than me) are saying that I overstepped and people can have different relationships with their parents. \n\nBut in my head if they say that, then she doesn\u2019t have to comment that I call my mom too much.  \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1680401957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1296xia/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_she_has_mommy_issues/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s hypocritical for them to be upset when you comment on her relationship with her mother. And I\u2019m no therapist but it sure sounds like your relationship with your mom is healthier than Emily\u2019s for sure.

I think it is perfectly normal to talk to your parents often, especially if you are living on your own for the first time. Your roommate really has no right to get upset with you for simply responding to her criticism.", "NTA, they had a go at you and you pushed back enough that now they have learned that people can have different relationships with their parents. No one has any business labelling anyone with \"mommy issues\" in this situation.

She can dish it put but can't take it. She seems jealous", "NAH\n\nI don't believe either of you have mommy issues. College students speaking with mom multiple times a day displays less independence.", "NTA, as you said, it\u2019s less then 30 minutes and just for checking up on you.

Sure what you did make you look childish but they open the door and don't dish if you can't take back.", "ESH.
