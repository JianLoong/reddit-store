She is in the wrong for giving an unsolicited opinion about your relationship with your mother. I imagine it is because on some level she resents the fact that her relationship with her mother is strained.\n\nThe two places where you erred (although neither make you an asshole) is that you should have respectfully set a boundary the first time\nshe commented on your relationship to eliminate that behaviour. The second is that you responded using the same line of thinking that Emily used, which is hypocritical. However, I completely understand you were initially trying to maintain peace and in this incident you simply had had enough and reached your typing point. Your actions were justifiable, but in future try a different approach that would be more effective and not drag you down to a lower standard of decorum.\n\nIt is categorically hypocrisy for Emily and Kate to chastize you for overstepping and ignore the fact that this started because Emily overstepped. I would encourage you to have a conversation about this and bring this up. Hopefully this could become a discussion about boundaries and how to restore a harmonious environment in your home together. Ideally this could be a convenient time to air out all grievances so everyone walks away resentment-free.\n\nThe most disappointing person here is Kate because she had the opportunity to approach the situation with neutrality and she could have easily deescalated the situation by hearing both sides and negotiating a resolution. If she does not have the personality or interest in doing so, she had the choice to not get involved and recuse herself. Instead, she made the most incendiary choice and chose a side based on a reason that is pure hypocrisy. Her bias towards one roommate and then deciding to get involved says a lot about her character and how much you can trust her. The fact that she did not see the inherent hypocrisy in her reprimanding you suggests that she is not particularly self-aware, a terrible mediator, and/or willingly ignorant to manipulate _the_ truth into _my_ truth. I would be extremely cautious around her because she seems like the type of person who would retaliate if ever scorned, but you would never see it coming because she hides behind a mask. Hopefully I am wrong and she is not that malicious, but her response to the situation was indicative of someone who enjoys conflict and conflict escalation.", "NTA .\n\nEmily should mind her business.

She was overstepping for commenting in your relationship and you were overstepping for making assumptions about her relationship.", "Honestly I think you are both at extreme ends of the spectrum with neither one of you falling within normal relationship ranges. And since you each fall at opposite sides of the spectrum its especially weird.\n\nYes, she probably does have parental relationship issues if she's gone 3 months without speaking to her parents. But honestly? You probably have issues too if you *haven't* gone 12 hours without speaking to yours. Thats literally just as weird.\n\nYou two should probably just just own your issues and your differences and move on. Different strokes and different folks make the world a wonderful place.", "Sounds like you have a great relationship with your mom.  That is awesome.", "Nta\n\nFor the last 10 years of my grandmas life, she and my mom would talk daily. There's nothing wrong with having a close relationship with your mom. I have one with my mom. My sil calls my mil daily. Sometimes more than once a day. Having a close relationship isn't what \"mommy issues\" are.", "NTA. I talk to my mom every or every other day, usually around 30 minutes. She\u2019s one of my best friends. If you were out of line by your comment than so was she.", "NTA. Everyone has different relationships with their parents and Emily shouldn\u2019t be throwing shade on you because of it, as if a closer relationship with parents and adult children means that\u2019s something wrong with the adult child. The \u201cdifferent relationship\u201d thing is valid not only when Emily is called out for her rudeness.", "NTA. That\u2019s great you have that relationship with your mom. \nI\u2019ve got the same with mine. It sounds like jealousy. They need to mind their own if they don\u2019t want it turned back on them.", ">\tNow both her and Kate (who has always been closer to Emily than me) are saying that I overstepped and people can have different relationships with their parents.\n\nThen why didn\u2019t Emily take her own advice and keep her mouth shut about your relationship with your mother?\n\nNTA. You only commented on Emily\u2019s relationship with her parents after she commented on yours. *She\u2019s* the one who opened the subject up for discussion, it\u2019s not your fault she is touchy about it.", "As my parents got older our telephone calls got more frequent. At first, it was three times a week so they knew I was okay. Years later, it has become every day so I know they were okay. I still miss calling my dad after I get home after work.", "You both have issues", "So she can say it to you, but you can't say it to her? Friend sounds like a clown", "NTA. I\u2019m 32 with a kid of my own and I still call my mom everyday to check up and chat", "As someone with mommy issues, don't stop talking to your mom and it isn't weird at all.", "I can't decide if this is an N-T-A, N-A-H, or E-S-H\n\nI'll be honest, I'm with your roommate on this one, though. That's a lot of contact with your mother. From my personal perspective, it's an unhealthy amount. I realize, however, that every person has their own perception of what is a healthy amount, so I would have kept my nose out of it. \n\nI'll give you one piece of advice, though. If and when you enter a committed relationship, don't share every detail of your life with them to your mother. That will foster into resentment very, very quickly.", "NTA If she keeps saying \u201cpeople can have different relationships with their moms\u201d look her dead in the eyes and say \u201cthen allow me to have one you started this entire mess.\u201d", "NTA. Sounds like your \"friend\" is jealous of your relationship with your mom.", "op=NTA\n\nShe's the one who OPENED the conversation.   IF your relationship may be discussed, then so should hers.\n\nYour relationship is NONE of her business unless it is somehow affecting her life.  Is it?  Do your calls/texts somehow interrupt her study or sleep time?  No? then she can shut the feck up.", "NTA. If you are happy talking with your mom, okay. Emily stepped over the line. Your chats with your mom are not her business. I hope your lease isn\u2019t too much longer with them.", "NTA. It's funny how you're overstepping about different relationships with parents but no one said anything when she's been doing it to you \ud83e\udd14", "I think you both are weird, but it's neither of yours business, how often you call each others mom. There might be reason, why your roommate doesn't call his mom.", "NTA", "I think OP just made a quick comment back to her friend after she insinuated she had issues for being close to her mom. It\u2019s completely normal for some folks to not speak to their parents as often and not necessarily an indicator that there are problems. But I agree, the term \u201cdaddy issues\u201d and \u201cmommy issues\u201d are horrible because you\u2019re insulting someone for having issues from having shit parents which is not their fault.", "User name checks out.", ">But, quite frankly, it is not the norm. \n\nWhere do you live where \u201cit is not the norm\u201d? Is it a cultural thing?", "I'm sorry, but there is no universe in which Id be jealous of calling either of my parents multiple times a day. That is WEIRD. Once a day is quite fine, but if you are constantly calling mom that much, there's definitely something going on to get sorted out.", "Agree. Emily definitely isn't \"fine\" with that low amount of contact because she just would've went about her day with a 'different strokes' mindset. She went out of her way to try to convince OP that her closeness with her mom is wrong and that something is wrong with her and to be more like her.\n\nEmily wants OP's relationship with mom to 'mirror' her own so she can be convinced her own lack of relationship with her parents is \"right\" so she doesn't have to feel bad about it. \n\nIt's actually sad since she could easily use that energy to get their relationship to a level of contact with that actually makes her happy. Instead she's just trying to convince the rest of the world that they're wrong and she's \"right/normal\".", "i talk to my mom everyday and i have mommy issues. i dont think the frequency of talking has anything to do with it.", "or OP could just love their mum??? why is that so crazy to consider?", "You do realise everybody has different relations with their parents right? When I stayed in a hostel I used to call my mom like once in 2/3 days but there were girls who used to call daily.. nothing's \"going on\"  in having constant conversation with your parents..", "Or maybe she is just trying to fit calls to her mum into her day - she says that the calls don\u2019t add up to more than half an hour in total, so really she is just keeping a conversation going via call rather than text, it\u2019s not that long a talk when you think about it", "They could just be a family who calls each other. My friend\u2019s family are callers not texters. When she was living at home if they wanted to ask \u201coh when are you coming back\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re having steak for supper\u201d they\u2019d call rather than text. It\u2019s just their personalities.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she is having multiple calls though. She may just be close with her mom and be best friends with her. Would people think this was strange if she was falling a friend? Probably not. I have a close relationship with my mom myself and though she is my parent we are also friends and I visit her at least once a week to hang out and chat. It may be weird to others but I don\u2019t care and o consider myself to be fortunate. \n\nThat being said, my freshmen year it college I had a friend whose mom was an abusive helicopter parent that called her multiple times a day to surveil her. Obviously that is problematic but doesn\u2019t seem to be the same as OP\u2019s situation.", "I can\u2019t think of a single person I\u2019d call that many times a day. Text, sure. But call, no.", "You have issues if you think having a close relationship and talking with a parent multiple times a day is wrong. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have that but don\u2019t judge others who do.", "Cherish those calls. I used to talk to my mom going and coming from work too. 12 years later and I still miss her every morning when I start driving.", "She passed away three years ago last week. \ud83d\udc94", "I am in my 20s and I can't imagine calling my mom that often. I usually call about every 2-3 weeks for an hour just catch things up. OPs situation is a bit unusual but if that's what they do then why not. Definitely ESH moments, neither of them should comment on each other's mothers. \n\nOPs friend sounded like they were joking, whereas OP straight up just said oh you ignore your parents for months which I mean. How many adults talk to their parents daily, or weekly? Bit of a low blow to a joke.", "Same here, and I also don't know anyone who is like that. But as long as it works for both people and it doesn't negatively affect them, why not?", "I don't even call my boyfriend that many times a day. It's funny how many people are bending over backwards to try to normalize it. It's fucking weird. When we see posts about people always running to mom after something happening in their life, they're always called out, but OP can't walk 2 steps around the world without notifying mom about it and somehow that's normal. OK.", "We are literally in a subreddit to make judgements. It's not like I'd go up in the street to stranger talking to their mom and tell them to quit it.", "I know someone who is convinced that my husband and I have shouting matches because she and her ex had shouting matches and her parents did, too, so \u201ceveryone\u201d does. It doesn\u2019t help that she watches a ton of TV and rational adults talking things out calmly doesn\u2019t make for good drama.", "Right?? And then they go on to say OP overstepped and everyone has different relationships with their parents...ironic and hypocritical much?", "I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\udc97", "And that\u2019s okay for you guys, but I have quite a few friends that talk to their moms everyday or dads, and even my mom talks to my grandma everyday too."]}
