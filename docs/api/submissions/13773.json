She doesn\u2019t go crazy if I don\u2019t call at all she just assumes I\u2019m busy and we text each other good night. \n\nMy roommate Emily always had something to say about it and I always brushed it off because she\u2019s also my friend so I just assume it was her being annoying for fun. \n\nAnyways, she tells me, \u201cit\u2019s really weird you still call your mom everyday. It\u2019s like you have some unresolved issues or something\u201d \n\nI look at her and point out she hasn\u2019t spoken to her parents at all since we\u2019ve been back in school from winter break and hasn\u2019t seen them in over 3 months. \n\nI say \u201cif anything you might have some mommy issues since you\u2019ve been ignoring her for 3 months now\u201d\n\nNow both her and Kate (who has always been closer to Emily than me) are saying that I overstepped and people can have different relationships with their parents. \n\nBut in my head if they say that, then she doesn\u2019t have to comment that I call my mom too much.  \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1680401957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1296xia/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_she_has_mommy_issues/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
