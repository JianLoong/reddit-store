This church was very welcoming and I had grown up with them since I was young. Every year they host a senior retreat, for the seniors in high school.  It was a really cool trip up until the last night, the day before we had left. \n\nThey told us, firstly, that we were to never tell ANYONE about this. Our friends, our family, other church members, no one. Apparently our parents knew but still, it haunts me to this day. They also took our phones and didn't tell us where we were going to be staying\n\nWe all met at a house and the whole senior class was there. They had told us that we were gonna partake in a maze! The leader, (we can call him Dan) told us all that we needed to be quiet in that exact second. Dan told us all that we were all gonna be blindfolded and we were not to take the blindfolds off, ourselves. I hate being blinded, so as everyone else was getting blind folded, I try to back away from everyone to not be blinded.  They escort us all into minivans by gender and we drive. The van I was in was dead silent. The only thing I could hear was my sniffling.  We drive into this beach and they line us out. Dan tells us that we're going to be partaking in a\"maze\". We were to take as long as we needed but we needed to find a way out. \"Or you could just drop out and be a major loser\" he mocked us. I didn't want to be considered a loser so I stayed on that maze\n\nFor 4 hours straight.\n\nOther seniors were finding their way \" out of the maze\",and I was getting discouraged. We were right by the ocean and I couldn't see to know where the shore was, so at any point my legs could be washed by waves. (I have thalassophobia). I didn't want anyone to touch me, I was in fight mode the whole 4 hours. I swung on a leader when he tried to grab my shoulder. Dan mocked me twice \"you could always just get off and bring a weakling\" \"you could stay on here and get to the exit, which you passed by the way, or get off like an idiot\". \n\nEventually, they pulled me away, only to reveal that the maze was a section of ropes in one giant circle. I was pissed. I had been doing this for 4 hours and all for nothing. \"We wanted you to surrender. That's all, you could've gotten off at any time\" Dan tells me. He could have said anything better but he didn't. I was quiet until I got home. I didn't eat for the day. I was traumatized.\n\nAbout a month later, the pastors all tried to reach out to me, asking about my trip and how great it was. But I wouldn't respond. So they made theories, that I turned against God or something. When Dan came to my house and asked me about my whereabouts, I told him I'm never returning to church. And he proceeded to call every pastor, and tell them that I'm a cast out and that I'm set for the devil. Back then I was scared that I'd be killed at the stake, but now I'm fine.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701050225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184rj5h/aita_for_leaving_my_church_due_to_cultlike/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One of the problems of non-denominational and unaffiliated religious groups is that there is no one to hold anyone accountable for anything.

Don\u2019t bother telling church leadership. Tell the local news and CPS.", "NTA.\n\nAny \"church\" that makes you put on a blindfold is a cult.

They did it to make themselves feel powerful and superior.  I dated aminster's daughter for about 2 years.

They get off on having a position of authority and power with no responsibility or culpability.\n\nWe were talking once and I asked her what it would mean if she gave up religion because she was asking me about my being an atheist.  When she told me it would mean letting go of a lot of guilt I felt so sorry that she had been brought up that way.\n\nFew years later we went to visit her mother after her lung cancer surgery. I promise to be nice to her father, and I was. Until he fat shamed her.... I do not put up with that shit from anyone.  Not only did I embarrass him I started asking him a lot of religious questions that disproved the Bible and his entire belief system. He felt like a moron because it couldn't answer a single one.  He knew it, I knew it and his daughter knew it she told me that she was giving up religion a few days after that.\n\nI would never associate with any of those people. They wasted your time just to make you feel bad. Fuck them... They aren't even practicing the stuff they pretend to preach.", "NTA - This is seriously werid. It strikes me as some kind of hazing.

This is just what their version/interpretation of their religion is and that's wholly valid as any other religion. It makes them absolutely awful and horrific people but that's just exactly their religion. The exercise definitely did have a reason and they full out said it. Submission. It's a cult tactic, where they weed out the ones who are smarter and more able to stand up for themselves so they can keep the ones they know they can manipulate. Glad op was able to get out!", "Yes.
