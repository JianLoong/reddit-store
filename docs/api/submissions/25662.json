Not to mention highly hypocritical. Method 2) Shock them. If a mother or father has to look straight at their sons wincing hairy asshole as he's going to town on his girlfriend to realize that maaaaybe the door should be allowed to have a lock, or maaaybe they should knock, than that is simply how it's going to have to be.\n\nScandalizing for all parties?
