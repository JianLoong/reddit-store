How one reacts would be case to case basis depending on the situation. Question is, is it worth being too emotionally vested on something that may (or may not) have been accidental? Sure, it was rude of them but it\u2019s possible it wasn\u2019t even intentional. Maybe a polite \u201cexcuse us\u201d from you would have been enough of a heads up for them. If they still did not get the hint or ignored it, then it\u2019s on them.", "ESH. Maybe you shouldn't be blocking the entire aisle. You were rude first, and you were rude last. Some spatial awareness will take you far.", "NTA, but not smart, either. It is not your job to police the rest of us on our non-abusive behavior. People willing to invade your space like that, without apology, are not suddenly going to realize they are wrong and you are right because you called them out.  I think you know that. If you were being honest, I think you\u2019d admit their behavior left you ANGRY, and that \u201ccalling them out\u201d was your way of hurting them in revenge.", "NTA - I say excuse if I walk in front of someone, breaking their vision from them to the shelves.  You\u2019re as fine as a good tiramisu.", "NTA but you and your partner sound incredibly obnoxious lmao", "If someone kept bumping into me a lot my spidey senses would be alerted.  I don't know how many people are professional pickpockets nowadays, but wouldn't want to deal with such a situation.\n\nYou were rude to them, OP, but perhaps your assertiveness saved your purse.  It's not wise to accost people in public, though, since there seems to be so much crazy behavior about.  \n\nI would have taken the coward's way out, and left.  If they seemed really hinky I might tell store security, but wouldn't want to engage with them.", "YTA. While getting bumped into isn\u2019t great, they may not have realized they were doing it, and you could\u2019ve brought it up politely if it was bothering you so much. Your partner\u2019s passive aggressive remark, calling someone a prick, and using bad language is rude and unconstructive.", "NTA", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. Obviously there\u2019s no need to swear but she had the audacity to confront you and your significant other after she and her daughter kept bumping you several times without any sort of communication.", "YTA, you are cussing out random strangers who you don't know. You are the one who needs to learn some manners.", "NTA. While the swear word wasn\u2019t necessary , She decided to confront you even though you weren\u2019t talking to her.", "NTA", "YTA", "ESH", "ESH, if you\u2019re blocking isles enough that they have to squeeze past you multiple times, you\u2019re TA. \u201cCalling them out\u201d was far more rude than them having the audacity to exist in the area you were attempting to shop. While an \u201cexcuse me\u201d would have been appreciated, if they didn\u2019t think they had made contact with you, it wasn\u2019t necessary. Honestly, the third time I have to squeeze past someone I\u2019m no longer saying excuse me, because it\u2019s likely you\u2019re the one being rude with your lack of special awareness.", "ESH", "NTA", "NTA - if she didn't want to be called out for disrespecting your personal space she shouldn't have been in it. \n\nA lady got really mad at me at an event last week because she wasn't paying attention and kept stepping backward into me/onto my feet. It was loud and crowded so I just said excuse me the first few times, but she didn't seem to notice - that I was speaking, that I was not a wall, AND that my feet are not the floor. \n\n About the fourth time, I finally snapped at her \"MA'AM! I am a person, please stop stepping on me\". And she was like \"well it was an accident, I'm clumsy\" and I, still short, was like \"you've repeatedly stepped ON me, you MIGHT be clumsy, but you're absolutely being both rude and oblivious\" \nShe apologized in a tone like I was being a psycho for interrupting her conversation over her repeatedly stepping on me, then loudly started complaining about how rude people are. Lol.\n\nEdit for clarification -- it was 1pm at a brewery, she was there for an infant's birthday party. I was standing at the bar talking to the bartender (a friend) while I waited for a drink. There was nowhere more appropriate for me to be standing.  when I started standing there, she was at least a foot away from me, she started backing up to make space for some other people to join her conversation, and apparently didn't care that there were people in the building besides her family.", "I personally would have done the same. They\u2019re both adults. If it was a kid it would be different but people really need to learn to have some common sense and courtesy.

No wonder people are such inconsiderate asses", "Wasn\u2019t taking up the aisle , the side our cart was touching one of the shelves so we were scooted in as much as we could in fact.", "Ahahahhhaha - yes blame the people trying to shop and can\u2019t keep track of every single person trying to get by vs the people that don\u2019t know how to practice common etiquette while navigating somewhere in public.", "We are actually pretty cognizant of the fact that carts take up a lot of room and in fact scooted ourselves and our cart completely to one side.\n\nShould we lie down and make ourselves two dimensional? Or should we proactively be on the prowl for people with perfectly functioning mouths and eyes that don\u2019t know how to say \u201cexcuse me\u201d in the case the other party is distracted while trying to do (in this case grab) something?", "Thank you :)", ":(  yeah I do regret using that expletive. How would you have handled that?", "So \u2026 calling someone out for bad behavior is worse than the rude behavior itself?", "Pretty sure my partner is not a dude, thanks though.", "I disagree here, he didn\u2019t really cuss her out to begin with and even if he/she did use an expletive , he/she didn\u2019t until she decided to confront them.", "If I changed the other person\u2019s gender so that they are a man, would you change your opinion?", "Yeah our behavior could\u2019ve been better , ty", "Respectfully, YTA/ESH. You responded to them being slightly rude to you being ruder. You admittedly said that they walked by by coincidence. Did it ever occur to you that they brushed by/bumped you by accident? Especially with 4 people moving through the aisles. And just like they should have said excuse me, you could have just as much, especially if you noticed that they were trying to get by.\n\nAnd you said it was a private conversation between you and your partner, but you were talking shit about someone indirectly while they were still around, of course they confronted you, c'mon.", "Someone bumping into you at a grocery store, with no one hurt, is not a significant event. If that's the biggest problem in your day, I envy your carefree life.", "Both of the things that you said apply to both groups of people", "probably would\u2019ve given them a dirty look but you do you", "Generally I look directly at the person and say \u201coh, excuse me\u201d completely deadpan. It\u2019s passive aggressive, but the other person usually gets the idea and they often apologize once they realize they\u2019ve been rude.", "No - I\u2019m referring to the manner with which it was called out. The rude/bumping behavior may have not been on purpose, but the name-calling was.", "Apologies, misread and edited!", "Yep absolutely. Fwiw I\u2019m a woman", "You should\u2019ve moved out the way after the first couple of times; and definitely should not have been calling names and such.", "Sure \u2026 them being in the same aisles as us could be an accident , but generally, common etiquette is to acknowledge the other person and communicate with them that you are going through. (Pretty sure that\u2019s how it works when we drive on the roads too)\n\nIf you are in close enough proximity with someone that you are at the point of making actual physical contact with them, an excuse me is usually in order. \n\nI\u2019ve managed to squeeze through huge crowds and public transit seats without pissing anyone off. An excuse me or \u201cpardon me\u201d goes a long long way.", "He stating they are doing this numerous times in multiple aisle if it were me by now I\u2019d be wondering about pick pocketers like seriously \ud83d\ude02no the ones constantly literally running into them are the assholes", "This is the fallacy of relative privation.", "Except one is stationary and trying to grab something from a high shelf and the other is mobile and has both eyes on the aisle", "I\u2019ll try that next time!", "Thank you!", "In all fairness we were talking between ourselves , she decided to confront us about a private conversation we were having between the two of us.", "No worries!", "Haha thanks, I Appreciate your opinion", "I added some details but this happened in multiple aisles \u2026 and we were already completely on one side", "Friend, you completely missed my point. They were rude for not saying excuse me, but it is a two-way street-literally. You saw them coming, you saw they were trying to move past you, and you could have just as easily said excuse me. There is no right of way in a grocery/department store aisle. Never mind the fact that it is common etiquette, it is not required. It's impolite not to do so, but definitely not calling someone a prick worthy.\n\nAnd you didn't call anyone out, you called them a prick behind their backs at a distance where they could hear you, which is infinitely ruder than them not saying a simple excuse me. Calling someone out is saying something directly to their face, not under your breath, and that's the real issue here. The mom and the daughter were rude- you made it worse.", "I can\u2019t believe I have to explain this but if you\u2019re standing still in an isle, you still have a responsibility to make sure you\u2019re not in the way of other shoppers, especially if you\u2019re with another person. If it\u2019s so hard to grab something, have an employee help you, that\u2019s literally in their job description.\n\nWhy are y\u2019all getting so worked up over a stranger\u2019s shopping experience anyway? Get a life", "Wasn't that private if she was able to hear it clearly and piece together you were talking about her.", "In retro and stepping back a bit you are correct. My apologies.", "I have never confronted someone that I suspected talking smack about me, mainly because that makes things worse.\n\nWhen I suspect someone is upset with me, I would just apologize or just brush it off.", "Same can be said about you. \n\nSounds like the OP had nowhere to go so some physical contact was going to happen anyways.\n\nGenerally, a \u201ccoming through\u201d or \u201clet me squeeze through real quick\u201d gets rid of any misunderstanding or animosity.", "FWIW we were completely on one side and weren\u2019t really blocking the aisle. Not sure what else we could\u2019ve done aside from ignoring her bumping us.", "Lol - using that same logic if you suspect someone or a group of people are talking about you, does that give you a right to confront them?\n\nLet\u2019s take it a step further: when you confront a group of people regarding a conversation that you are not a part of, would you expect a warm reception?", "You obviously don\u2019t live in a city", "That's cool, that's you, a lot of people don't like conflict. But at the same time would you call someone a name under your breath where they could hear you? I'm guessing no, because that is also inviting conflict. See how no one was right in this situation?", "It\u2019s not hard to say \u201cSorry, we\u2019ll be out of your way in a second\u201d. If you haven\u2019t realized that after all the other comments saying what was wrong with this entire interaction then there\u2019s no getting through to you. But frankly, I couldn\u2019t care less and I\u2019m not wasting my time on this anymore.", "That's not the same logic at all.", "I do, I just have situational awareness.", "I interpreted it as OP commenting to the person they were with, which happens but isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nEither way: if you don\u2019t like conflict; why would you confront a group of people already annoyed at you?", "Ah yes we should definitely apologize when they abruptly bump us even though we didn\u2019t even see them.", "Didn\u2019t you say that she had a right to confront us over a comment we made to each other?\n\nIn response to your post about you having situational awareness\u2026 that type of thinking makes me deduce you really don\u2019t have that.\nYou should try confronting a group of people on the subway / train and see where it takes you.", "I think minding your own business and not approaching angry strangers over what you suspect they may be saying about you would be a great tool to add to your awareness kit.", "I didn't say she had a right to confront them. I said saying it loud enough that she was able to hear didn't make it private. So maybe gain some reading comprehension.", "So would not antagonizing people by calling them a prick when they can hear you. She was rude by not saying excuse me, then you two escalated it.", "She was being a prick, so I decided to call her one to someone I was with.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t do was approach her directly and make that comment.\n\nHappens more often than you think."]}
