Out of this, my parent(50) takes \u00a3100 for bills, then I pay off my phone bill and food with the rest. I have very little left to spend on anything else at all, especially with prices on everything going up.\n\nMy parent is about to be a doctor of psychology. She's consistently in and out of positions, but even despite this she makes a lot of money for the cheap area and house we live in. They often have money leftover to buy themselves expensive gadgets like laptops, new phones and the like. Up until recently, they were also going on holiday (vacation) practically every 2 months. Weekend cruises and getaways, even a trip to New York this time last year. They never really complain about the cost of utilities or rent (though they have a habit of simply not paying things they owe and racking up debt that they will ignore).\n\nWell, I received my CoL (Cost of Living) payment two days ago. I have a credit card that was essentially maxed out, so when I got the payment I felt I should put the vast majority into bringing that debt down. Bring on benefit as I am, I will very rarely get opportunities to do this, and I don't want to rack up debts. I kept the fact that I had received it hidden from my parent; they tend to yell and scream and guilt trip me if I don't give them the half they feel entitled to.\n\nFor context, I have given them half of it every time in the past, but have been unhappy about it and they know that. Considering that they make quite a lot for where we live and that I have practically nothing to my name, it never felt fair but I did it anyways because, before now, I would have only spent that other half on games and such anyway.\n\nWell, today they found out I had received it and used it to pay off my debt instead. They yelled, insulted me, all the things I expected once they found out. Now we aren't talking except when I pass by them in the house and they demand that I find a way to give them \u00a3150 regardless, demanding I give them my credit card, etc. I've just been ignoring them.\n\nThe rest of my family and siblings think I should have given it to my parent anyways and nobody cares that I also have things to pay off with far less opportunities to do so than my parent.

And it wasn\u2019t my age or skill that got me out of that, that was done through additional suffering, getting evicted and a determination to make sure I\u2019m \u201cuseful.\u201d Or in better words valuable. \n\nInitially I couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s valuable looked like. So I got Junior jobs. Swallowed some more shit in the workplace strategically, yes, but it has as I mentioned mostly fizzled out now by age 34m.", "If so many people are having the same personal experience, it probably isn't a lie.\n\nI have retail certificates that don't really mean shit, one or two IT ones. That's it.", "I'm subjecting myself to it because, all in all, I'm better off here than I would be on my own.\n\nI don't think their intentions are good at all. But it's either deal with this whenever I get extra from the government, or have it harder and more consistently in my own place because of the cost of living crisis.", "That'd be pretty nice to have here lol. I job search all the time, most of the vacancies are managerial positions.", "I did use it. For debt.\n\nWould ya'll really prefer I just let myself sink into debt until it's uncontrollable?", "The only thing I can think of is I spend/eat too much sugary stuff. \n\nBut all of that is from groceries. Idk if you're in the UK or what, but they're insanely expensive.", "They also stated they gambled to get part of that debt, so I suspect that's part of the equation that's being glossed over.", "When I say thousands, I don't mean single digits. If I had to ballpark it, they're probably about 15k-20k in debt overall", "Trying to do the calm sarcastic thing when you've shown you're really angry (and apparently racist) doesn't really work.\n\nI found my justification though. Will keep sponging thanks", "Not brum thankfully lmfao, I'm near walsall", "Having me work with old and/or disabled people or children would not go well lol. Care work is the one type of position I can genuinely say I can never do. Not out of any excuse or preference, but I do not have the patience for them at all. That's the only way I can put it", "Did I say there was a vast private market, no.  But I do know around 50 people who do exactly that work each week, helping kids of all ages to learn to read, write or math because their parents work full time and can't.  \n\nI've worked two jobs, I've done 13 hour days.I've never had it easy in my life so yes I do know the real world. I also get tired of people brushing off ideas before even looking into it.  \nIts called being pro-active and not waiting for jobs to appear, getting experience in life.   I also dont live in a rich area. I dont earn huge amounts myself.", "Did you work while you were finding yourself?", "If the jobs were identical, or at least statistically categorized, that would be one thing. However, unless you're honed in on a specific job, function, or location, you'll find that there are very few statistics to support your claims. Much of this comes down to personal experience. Despite this, there is a wealth of labor market data available, which shouldn't be ignored.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that we're discussing entry-level positions, which are notoriously low-paying and open by millions. As for general certifications, they often end up being more of a drain on your finances than a valuable asset.\n\nA more effective approach involves checking online for specific certifications that are sought after by particular companies. Take the time to investigate the credentials of those currently holding the positions you're interested in on LinkedIn. Completing at least 20% of the certificate training within a couple of weeks is advisable, as it provides a solid foundation of knowledge.\n\nWhen reaching out to professionals in the field, focus on building genuine connections. If someone isn't receptive, it's their loss. Engage with those who show interest in sharing their knowledge and insights, and remember to make an impression that lasts. \n\nGeneral disclaimer: If you haven't engaged in face-to-face conversations with individuals in your desired field, expressing your interest in their work and seeking advice, you haven't truly made an effort.", "I\u2019m not quite sure who convinced you of this depressing nature of life. It\u2019s not true. \n\nYou are a fully functional and valuable part of our little global community. And you are studying for college, with reliable internet access and medical care based on your description. \n\nKnowing how many low-effort, low paying jobs there are would blow your mind. But one thing is true about these jobs: the boss does not want to spend time on your. Hence the certificate. \n\nLow effort people throw complicated paperwork or language at you hoping to kill your motivation and propose nightmare scenarios at you\u2026 but it\u2019s just not true. \n\n40k+ jobs are 1 certificate\u2026 about 1 college exam away.  \n\nThe rest (besides skill) it is 100% if people WANT to work with you. And believe me PEOPLE haven\u2019t changed. They\u2019re still judgemental assholes with unreasonable expectations, just like high school or the day they were born crying demanding results. It\u2019s instinct. \n\nHowever this has nothing to do with you. \n\nYes I graduated college with a meh GPA and took 6 years instead of 4, it wasn\u2019t the degree I stated with, isn\u2019t the degree I really want\u2026 not even in my field \n\nWhy\u2026 I had a great time working honestly. So i just did it because I thought I should. Still happy I completed that part don\u2019t get me wrong. \n\nBut none of my entry level jobs during before and after my graduation cared at all about my degree or personal demands  (like favourable hours). \n\nOnly now at 75k+ is my degree being looked at and do I feel I work in a career. (Still not something I agree with, since it isn\u2019t even in my field)\n\nBut I got my job(s) by watching YouTube videos and sending LinkedIn messages and asking questions about the job. Eventually they wanted to check me out.", "Do you apply in person to a lot of smaller local places too? I run one of those, and we give people entry level jobs all the time. We just don't bother to advertise, as we have CVs handed in pretty regularly.", "Cant be that expensive.  Dont get sugary food then.  Rice/flour and chicken are cheap. Still think youre not budgeting right", "You're spending above the national average. And the average is taking into account the high earners too. So you're definitely spending far more than is needed (unless you're very active and train a lot).", "Why are you buying ANY \u201csugary stuff\u201d???  You are literally impoverished, you screwed yourself over with a gambling debt, you flat out refused to pay rent because reasons, and you think you can afford to waste money on dessert?\n\n>At this point, they'd react badly if they found out it was gambling and the situation would worsen. If I know my parent, they'll scream at me for being stupid, tell the rest of my family, they'll also scream and insult me, then they'll never trust me with anything financial again.\n\nI\u2019m sorry - are you trying to imply that wouldn\u2019t be a completely valid and justified reaction?  You WERE stupid.  And your parents are having to bankroll your stupid actions, because you\u2019re screwing them out of the rent you owe them.  It doesn\u2019t matter how much money they have.  A store has a ton more money than I do - I still have to pay for my items.\n\nAnd as for \u201ctrusting\u201d you?  You lied to them about your debt, and now you\u2019re refusing to pay them the money you owe them.  Why *should* they trust you?  You\u2019ve already proven that you\u2019re untrustworthy.", "Are you talking credit card debt or low interest loans debt", "Mate, you came here asking if you're an asshole. So, you must have a sense somewhere deep down that it could be true? It's the point of the sub is it not? I'm sorry I'm not validating your bad behaviour, but if that's not what you wanted, you shouldn't have posted here. YTA.\n\nIf you want actual help, post on the UK personal finance sub. That would make more sense given your situation.", "Jobs in retail and restaurants aren\u2019t \u201ctaken\u201d. Go back to the same places and try again. \n\nIf it\u2019s industrial get certified as truck or carriage loader it\u2019s really fun work if your team is experienced. \n\nManual work and/or chemical cleaning usually gets you a job the same night you\u2019re certified. Various certifications are NOT to actually handle any real dangerous chemicals but allowing you to be on the teams that \u201cmay\u201d encounter them. \n\nMy brother who was a painter got a certificate taking 4 days which certified him to paint chemical pipes. You know red, blue, yellow. \n\nHe\u2019s dyslexic. But guess what the Netherlands has some pretty great support systems and he was able to take the exam with a spoken examiner (asking the questions) out-loud. \n\nHe says the work he does now (or had to, read on) is actually even simpler (painting random surfaces in random conditions of random ages with random paints) became structured, planned and in his opinion a series of breaks at work. Painting and repainting cold and hot pipes with fancier tools than my brother ever had access to. (Think fancy not complex) \n\nSo he soon quite that job of course and went into the asbestos removal! I think the easy painting was too \u201csafe\u201d for him lol and the pay raises were pretty significant. \n\nNot knowing this was an option before opened new doors for him (even where you may need to pay for the service in other countries yourself its well worth it right) Initially he believed \u201cthis\u201d painting for minimum wage is what he was meant for because of his dyslexia. Had to knock that idea out of his head to.\n\nI hope you stop listening to ridiculous limits of strangers.\n\nNone of what I have said is personal advice, I don\u2019t know you. Hopefully encouraging though", "If you\u2019re considering fast food places for jobs, I\u2019d say you\u2019re underestimating the patience required! But fair enough.", "No it\u2019s called being patronising and delusional. You don\u2019t live in a rich area but there is a market supporting 50 people within your acquaintance circle providing private tuition? Sounds believable. Even more so with the idea that parents who work full time prioritise private tuition for their kids. And that\u2019s with a large assumption that parents are able to find work too and work that pays sufficiently. \n\nYou can claim your hard work credentials but have you ever lived anywhere with very high rates of unemployment and even higher rates of underemployment? Where people average years of job searching? Where there are 500 applicants for every basic retail job? What exactly does work ethic have to do with an inability to find a job? \n\nI have to hope you are a boomer who is completely divorced from reality.", "Yes. My first job about a year after I left school was an apprenticeship, then I finished that and lived with my sister for a summer to work near her.

The 100 per month is the rent. The 150, by my parent's own words, is what they feel entitled to just because it's a lot of money to what I usually have and they feel they should have half.\n\nAnd no, I wouldn't yell and scream and insult someone for that. There's few scenarios where that kind of aggression and loss of temper is called for. Not handing over 150 one time, for the sake of clearing debt, really doesn't seem like one of those few scenarios.", "A mixture of both.", "Handling annoying assholes at a checkout is significantly easier than handling vulnerable people who can't help it haha, I guess that's the way to put it"]}
