Obviously not happy with this news. I don't want to share but I also acknowledge that hogging down all the food would be selfish.\n\nSo she notices the pause and goes \"fine I guess I'll just figure something out\" in a pissy tone. I go \"no no no we can split it.\" And give her half. I go on to explain my situation but I don't think she cared. She was annoyed that I even paused.\n\nNow I only had half my dinner and am still hungry. I can't imagine asking for half of someone's food as they are just sitting down to eat.

Your family has a different organization of meals than others might. You seem to have only been following your meal routine. And you were very hungry after work and your training. Others are subtly discounting your training, but honestly if it was framed as \u201cthis is a way I relieve stress after a long week of work/kids,\u201d then I don\u2019t think they would. \n\nAnyways, I think having a pause is understandable in this context.

I do the same thing, where I struggle to change a plan I had in my head on the fly. Maybe it\u2019s a neurodivergent thing of some kind.\n\nNow for the ESH. I think others aren\u2019t wrong in that the kids are the issue. It seems like you should communicate with your wife about how she feels about taking care of the kids. You seems to see it as a grand time, but she may be struggling with the responsibility. That could have motivated her outburst. I think you should have a long discussion about your schedules and relationship as a whole. Based on my experience with my mom and dad, she could be feeling you\u2019re inconsiderate of her. \n\nMy mom honestly will do the same thing with my dad. Hear him head towards something that triggers her, then immediately react angrily. Sometimes it understandable. Other times you\u2019re scratching your head about it being that deep. Your wife may be mad about a deeper trend you\u2019re not seeing, but not doing the best job of communicating it. She may see this as part of a larger pattern.

And only dull people can't find a way to entertain themselves. \n\nReading books, watching movies/tv shows, brush up on the languages I speak, learn a new language, color in adult coloring books, learn to crochet, try my hand at painting and other art forms, listen to podcasts, play games on my phone, look for fun places and things to do for vacation, take a shot at baking/dessert making, work on training with my dog, go through recipe books/online to find new recipes to try, try said recipes, take dance lesson, paint my nails with intricate designs, play with makeup to figure out how to actually do it well, get more items listed to sell online........I could probably go on all day. Those were the things I came up with off the top of my head.", "You have multiple kids young enough to need bath supervision and can still make it to a 3 hour hobby every single week thanks to your wife - and you're pissy that one week she wanted some of your food?", "It sound like OP came home as his wife was bathing the kids and doing their bed time routine so she wouldn\u2019t even know he was cooking to ask", "Maybe because she was \"hanging with the kids\" giving them a bath so she didn't had time to ask him", "What's wrong with saying hanging out with the kids?  Why does it need to be a work related statement?  I hang out with my kids all the time.  Why do people think that all time spent with children is difficult work and that you can't also have fun?", "That\u2019s good. What did they have? Did she feed them earlier but not eat herself? Or did you make food for them after your sushi?", "My partner is a stay at home dad and I am the breadwinner. But we used to do it the other way round, so I think I'm qualified to speak to this. If I had been looking after the kids all day and then my partner then also took himself to the gym all evening and then didn't even ask whether I'd eaten, I would be seething. I would have smoke coming out of my ears like a cartoon. \n\nShe stayed home with the kids and did supper and baths and bed by herself so he could do his hobby and he resented her eating his shitty dinner??????", "Sounds like you dad was a great guy!  Being a husband and a dad I always believe that me needs come last.", "I love your father.", "Or dad can pull out the meals. Why mom every time?", "That was the one important rule we introduced for my husband and I. He loves to work out and it helps a lot for his mental health, but he had to come home first and check I was okay, when our son was a newborn. \nHe even bought equipment to work out at home, and would work out late at night or early morning. \n\nRaising kids is bloody hard work.", "You are a gem", "Your father sounds awesome", "Nothing about OP's post makes sense, to me. \n\nWe have dinner at 6 pm. Tradition. I cook. If he's not home, or I don't feel like eating, I make plates. \n\nFrequently, I don't feel like eating after cooking. We can get the munchies and raid the fridge in the middle of the night. \n\nBreakfast at 3 am? Why not?\n\nNo reason for a grown adult with food in the house to go hungry and whine about it!\n\nOP is YTA.", "Yes, her \"day off\".", "My older kids are definitely easier. They are more helpful and independent. I\u2019m just sad that time has flown by so fast!! Not sad enough for more, but I do miss those busy and emotional toddler days!", "Well as a parent with young kids (2 and 4) they can feed themselves very well. She could have ate when they ate but didnt.\n\nShe easily could fix herself something at any time and ate it at any time.", "No, you don't deal with them. You just hang with them. You do no parenting except showing how *not* to be a good partner.", "And likely didn\u2019t have time to make herself something unlike you after your fun activity. Bet we hear from you in a couple years wondering why your wife left you.", "75% of this sub has become people without children or bitter people with children going on tirades about how men are abusive, violent, narcissistic, entitled garbage bags for downplaying the work their wife does, her wants and needs or not reading her mind. It's honestly so out of control these type of posts should be banned lol.", "He has some funny clapbacks for them all though", "Lmao that giddy part was so cringe ngl", "Agreed! We always have cucumbers and cherry tomatoes in the house. And good olives and good cheddar in the fridge. That and crackers is actually a meal we really enjoy, especially this time of year.\n\nIf we're feeling extra fancy we'll throw a few eggs on to boil before cutting the vegetables.\n\nDarn. Now I'm hungry!", "My kids would rather eat that than a delicious home-cooked meal we spent hours slaving over, lol.\n\nFor lunch yesterday they had watermelon, peanut butter crackers, and cheese wedges, because they didn\u2019t want to eat their dad\u2019s *amazing* baked macaroni with shrimp and bell peppers.", "It\u2019s just sort of ingrained in me. Even when arriving as a guest you offer help. It doesn\u2019t matter how tired or hurt you are. I used to work overnights in hospital security. That meant I came home frequently after being assaulted. Still woke the kids up, let the dogs out, and made breakfast for everyone, and took the kids to school. Let the ex sleep in.", "LOL, thank you. I had a lot of good role models.", "Well that goes both ways, he says food wasn\u2019t discussed, so he didn\u2019t mention it either. \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA on this, he\u2019s had to work, sure, but he\u2019s only thought about himself all day. He\u2019s gone straight out to a class, then made himself food while his wife\u2019s day has been all about her looking after the kids - doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s even seen the kids at all. \n\nAnyone who thinks looking after children is just \u2018hanging out with the kids\u2019 is immediately the AH, and not even asking if his wife wants anything before making his food is pretty selfish.", "Not everyone is on your schedule, Mrs. Cleaver.", "Thank you. I definitely made it a point not to blame them for being needy little children since that\u2019s literally what they were. My kid actually started asking me for something the other day and stopped mid-request when he saw I was eating and told me to call him when I was done. \n \nIt\u2019s weird that you say that because a lot of the hard days meant I didn\u2019t have the time or patience or motivation to take care of myself as I should have and that was because I had small children. Sometimes that sandwich I made and then ate standing in the kitchen at midnight was all I ate for the day. Sometimes I just downed a glass of chocolate milk and went to bed with baby spit in my hair from one of them trying to nurse with a chunk of my hair in their hand.", "Lady, they are 6 and 8 years old", "most kids i know bathe with their parents or will do joined showers in a time crunch up to the age of 5-6. not just kids who are on soft foods", "Miserable parents thread lol", ">I never understand why people take this opinion that a mother at home with a kid or two is a harder job than the father working to provide\n\nWell, almost certainly no one cried, pooped or screamed during his work day. If he needed the bathroom, he could probably go in a timely manner with zero people watching him and climbing on the bathtub. I'd be very surprised if he had to tell anyone \"stop licking that\" at any point.", " Mom also provides for the family! His statement is she was not working today. Not that she\u2019s a SAHM. \nAnd SAHMs are also providing for their family in different ways. Save cost on childcare as well as ensuring kids are brought up in a good environment. \nPlease leave the 1950\u2019s behind. \n\nIt\u2019s a simple task to communicate with your spouse.  \u201cHey what\u2019s for dinner? \u201c\nThis couple both lack in basic communication. \nIf either one of them had called the other this whole situation could be avoided.", "Finally some sense. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with the guy admitting he\u2019s very annoyed by his wife.", "Exactly. This scenario is why we always have oven ready stuff at home. Grab the frozen dim sum or fish filet, heat it up, and you\u2019re golden. Or just some pasta with cheese and tomato sauce. Take less than 15 mins.", "Yes that would certainly be true but it doesn\u2019t sound like any of that happened based on her saying \u201cwe had a late lunch and I haven\u2019t eaten\u201d", "They\u2019re 8 and 6, not toddlers.", "We call that a \u201cchopped salad\u201d and we always have the makings in the fridge. \n\nWe also have the old standard \u201cSteal food from Mum/Wife\u201d so I know when I make snacks, I\u2019ll be raided. I make extra.", "That phrase 'hanging out with the kids' got me too. He completely undervalues what she does.", "If you share a life with someone who keeps a food log, trust me, you know they keep a food log and how important it is to them.  No communication needed about it on any one particular day.", "Yeah, might come down to a case of dumb wording. He's not making a great case for himself in his comment replies, though that's for sure."]}
