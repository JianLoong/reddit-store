Obviously not happy with this news. I don't want to share but I also acknowledge that hogging down all the food would be selfish.\n\nSo she notices the pause and goes \"fine I guess I'll just figure something out\" in a pissy tone. I go \"no no no we can split it.\" And give her half. I go on to explain my situation but I don't think she cared. She was annoyed that I even paused.\n\nNow I only had half my dinner and am still hungry. I can't imagine asking for half of someone's food as they are just sitting down to eat.

Your family has a different organization of meals than others might. You seem to have only been following your meal routine. And you were very hungry after work and your training. Others are subtly discounting your training, but honestly if it was framed as \u201cthis is a way I relieve stress after a long week of work/kids,\u201d then I don\u2019t think they would. \n\nAnyways, I think having a pause is understandable in this context.

I do the same thing, where I struggle to change a plan I had in my head on the fly. Maybe it\u2019s a neurodivergent thing of some kind.\n\nNow for the ESH. I think others aren\u2019t wrong in that the kids are the issue. It seems like you should communicate with your wife about how she feels about taking care of the kids. You seems to see it as a grand time, but she may be struggling with the responsibility. That could have motivated her outburst. I think you should have a long discussion about your schedules and relationship as a whole. Based on my experience with my mom and dad, she could be feeling you\u2019re inconsiderate of her. \n\nMy mom honestly will do the same thing with my dad. Hear him head towards something that triggers her, then immediately react angrily. Sometimes it understandable. Other times you\u2019re scratching your head about it being that deep. Your wife may be mad about a deeper trend you\u2019re not seeing, but not doing the best job of communicating it. She may see this as part of a larger pattern.

Had to scroll way too far for this\u2026 \n\nI totally agree. It\u2019s really on both of them. They\u2019re adults with children. Where was the conversation about dinner plans and confirmation that he was on his own for dinner? \n\nAs a parent, I get the assumption. As a mom, I appreciate that he made the assumption AND TOOK CARE OF HIMSELF. I\u2019d honestly be annoyed AF if my husband came home at 8:30pm and said \u201cwow, I\u2019m starving! What was for dinner?\u201d and expected me to help him with that. Like, no. Tough shit, fool. You weren\u2019t here. You planned not to be here. We already ate. \n\nAlso as a parent and a wife\u2026 wtf dude? Call each other, maybe? \n\n\u201cHey babe, checking in on dinner plans since you know I\u2019ve got that thing late tonight. Y\u2019all good? I\u2019m on my own when I get home, yeah?\u201d \n\nOr even\u2026\n\n\u201cHey babe, on my way home from my thing we talked about that I\u2019d be out late for. I\u2019m starving so planning to eat as soon as I get home.

It seems like a regular thing for him to take his class after work, and it is assumed he is on his own for dinner. It's probably likely that she also knows she is on her own for dinner, as it seems like they have somewhat of a system worked out.\n\nWould it be kind of him to offer his food if she asked? Yes. Should he feel obligated to? If it was known that they were both on their own for dinner, no. These are very common situations that get worked out between parents when there are kids around.

The pro-woman attitudes in this sub are out of control. OP asked about meal sharing and almost every response is going in and on about his not taking care of his kids when zero information was given in respect to kids/home work distribution.

To be clear, you\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never had a super busy day, made sure the kids are fed/bathed/etc, then realized you haven\u2019t peed - let alone made yourself dinner?", "Your comment is 100% Great Mom Actions. Your kids are lucky to have you because you don't act as if you can't or didn't take care of yourself because of them. I would be devastated if my mom had made it seem like I was the reason she had to have half of my dad's dinner. \n\nYou rocked it! Thank you for being a good mom as well as being able to maintain your needs at the same time.", "I'm infertile but thanks, I think?", "Yeah I was about to hop in and say something about that last comment. I've worked as a kitchen manager at a very busy Chili's, we would hit capacity every night and there was always a wait for a table. Weekends were worse, everyone at the tables plus massive to-go catering orders. I'd regularly work 14-16 hr shifts sometimes because people kept calling out or were sorry-asses who didn't want to work. Open to close, then open again the next day type shit.\n\n Being a SAHM and also being pregnant is so much worse. I do have Hyperemesis gravidarum which adds to the struggle, but even without it I'm stressed. I have an autistic/adhd 4 year old on top of feeling nauseous and vomiting every day even at 5 months pregnant. With my daughter, it lasted until I gave birth. I would rather have a clock in clock out job, but specialized childcare is fucking ridiculous and I'd barely be bringing in money. I already know how my daughter is... she wouldn't last long at a daycare before they called begging me to come get her. I do yearn for a break, but my bf works full time so I don't ask him to do much. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOP isn't the asshole though, that was his food and he worked plus worked out. The wife, no matter how tired, could have made herself something to eat but she chose to pressure Op into sharing. Yes, I've been exhausted before and just wanted something quick to eat. That's life. She should start buying quick meals for situations like that. I personally like the healthy frozen meals you can get at Walmart for like $3 each. But also he does need to understand that \"hanging out with the kids all day\" is a lot harder than it fucking looks. OP listen to Mr. Mom, it's a country song but I forget the singer who made it.", "Even like they were all just chilling taking a bath together, wtf? No, she was bathing the kids, a parenting task.", "Lmao the husky would be enough, those guys fucking YELL, I've never seen another breed do that", "He claims that she gets her own time off during the week. But yeah, it seems insane to me that he spends three hours on jiu-jitsu, and keeps a detailed food log, but can't be arsed to send his wife a text asking about her dinner plans.", "Have you never been \"on your own\" for dinner? It just means you don't rely on someone for the food. If someone happens to make something for you, that's great, but you don't plan for it.", "So at that exact moment where she wanted to eat part of her husbands dinner what was stopping her from making a sandwich", "Even if she genuinely doesn\u2019t want the snack, the gesture will be appreciated.

Since I'll be running late, don't worry about making me anything for dinner, I'll fix something for myself. Can you fix something for you and the kids? I got Fridays when you go out for yoga.\"\n\nIf they both agreed to something like this, then he is certainly NTA and this is a very normal couple conversation.", "Good enough for the wife to want some.

Different strokes for different folks.", "If you\u2019re going to split hairs, so can we.

Unless she made her kids skip dinner, she could have made her own meal at the same time she made theirs. If she believed the late lunch she gave the kids was their dinner, why doesn't she think they might be hungry just like she is and make both herself and the kids good?\n\nSorry, but she failed her children on this one if we're supposed to believe SO needed to give up the sushi to her because she's sooooo hungry. She needs to get her act together before her kids get lost in the process.

Perfectly content to sit with me and watch a movie or play games, build LEGO, or whatever we felt like doing. I love spending time with them. They didn't really give me much trouble, and honestly my cats give me more issues than my kids ever have. lol. It's still very tiring to take care of kids, but my point is I didn't really have to \"wrangle\" them like everyone keeps saying, even when they were really young (they're 18 and almost 12 now). Given the way you talk about your kids, I'm wondering if yours might be similar.  \n\nEither way, it just really sounds to me like you and your wife need to talk about what the plan is for dinner in the future just so that each of your expectations are clear, even just sending a text after class and asking if she's eaten yet or if she wants you to grab enough for her to have a portion, too.", "But he was giddy with excitement \u2026.

You have your wife do all that.", "bro you guys are so pathetic get off reddit and get a life yeah there is a lot to talk about regarding this post yet all I've seen is people get so wound up in the wording its insane. People use different words in different contexts and its clear he's not trying to demean her by saying she's hanging with the kids. Clearly when he says hang here he's mocking you and the rest of the idiots who think 'hanging with the kids' is a horrible way  to put it"]}
