I had the exact amount of rice and only two sheets of seaweed. I get home and my wife and kids are in the bathroom taking a bath so I get to work on my sushi. I have the entire thing written down and I'm ready to feast.\n\nI'm giddy with excitement sitting down at the table. All the sudden my wife comes out and into the kitchen and says \"can I have half of that? Me and the kids went out for a late lunch and I haven't eaten\"\n\nI pause. Obviously not happy with this news. I don't want to share but I also acknowledge that hogging down all the food would be selfish.\n\nSo she notices the pause and goes \"fine I guess I'll just figure something out\" in a pissy tone. I go \"no no no we can split it.\" And give her half. I go on to explain my situation but I don't think she cared. She was annoyed that I even paused.\n\nNow I only had half my dinner and am still hungry. I can't imagine asking for half of someone's food as they are just sitting down to eat.

Also what the heck did the kids have for dinner...?!\n\nBut back to my point, YTA for talking about her day like spending it with the kids is just leisure time.

You're a father. Act like one.", "Info: are nights like these a normal occurrence?\n\nHonestly I think there\u2019s probably more nuance to this situation than AITA can handle. If the jiu jitsu class is planned in advance, your wife has a similar amount of free time to indulge in her hobbies while you handle the domestic responsibilities, and she\u2019s aware of your focus on nutrition, then you\u2019re not an AH - she\u2019s probably just exhausted and short on patience. \n\nIf you\u2019re taking personal time every night at her expense, only considering your own needs, and dumping all of the planning on to her - then you\u2019re clearly an AH and sharing dinner is the least you could do. \n\nThe real situation is probably somewhere in between and could probably just be solved by a little extra planning and consideration.", "YTA.

It's wrangling them. That's a lot, and it's easy to miss eating and mom's often skip meals with the kids. \n\nAlso:\n\n>I can't imagine asking for half of someone's food as they are just sitting down to eat.\n\nYou're not just someone. You're her husband. It's not unusual to share meals with spouses.", "YTA. Thinking your wife spending all day with your children is just \u201changing out\u201d blows my mind.
