Husband won\u2019t wake up for his 15 alarms which leads to fights every morning.", "selftext": "I\u2019m a 27 year old female, husband 31 year old male. My husband wakes up(or should be waking up) 1.5 hours before my alarm goes off. He starts his job earlier than mine. We have 2 young kids. Every single day his alarms will go off every 5-10 minutes he won\u2019t wake up for them unless I wake him up then he will snooze them and we repeat the process. It is extremely frustrating and exhausting on my end because it wakes me and the children up at 5am and he ends up being late for work most days. To be honest it is making me have negative feelings about him, he won\u2019t try anything to fix it. I feel like he doesn\u2019t care that it wakes me and the kids up, it also wakes up our dog which then leads to me having to let her outside and then I\u2019m up way before I need to be taking care of the kids and the dogs. This wouldn\u2019t be a huge problem if he would wake up in the middle of the night when the kids wake up and need attention but he doesn\u2019t wake up for that either. So here I am going to bed after him, waking up multiple times throughout the night with the kids and waking up to his 5am alarm daily. Even on my days off. I don\u2019t know if this is as big of a problem as I feel like it is. At this point I\u2019m looking for suggestions he won\u2019t go to a sleep doctor and he won\u2019t buy a fancy alarm that vibrates or anything like that.", "created_utc": 1683806004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13el52u/aita_husband_wont_wake_up_for_his_15_alarms_which/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After talking with her about it, she stopped. That\u2019s what a partnership looks like. NTA. Is he otherwise normally this selfish?", "This is such an act of aggressive incompetence. \n\nI hate the mornings. Im not attuned to them. But I didn't choose a job that requires me to wake up at 5 am. If I did, I suspect I'd still manage. Because I wouldn't want to get fired. How does his job react to this lateness? \n\nNta and you wouldn't be TA if you requested a separate bedroom.", "NTA if he is not getting up and keeps snoozing his alarm I would tell him, AND MEAN IT that as from tomorrow he gets 3 snoozes after which you will cancel his alarm. If he is late because he's overslept let him take the big boy consequences. When he's reprimanded in work for being late it might jolt him into action", "Nta. He lets it happen because he knows you'll wake him up when he's actually going to be late. Tomorrow morning just get up when the first one goes off and leave the room. Go back to sleep on the couch. If he sleeps in and is late for work so be it. He's an adult not a 5 year old. He can get himself out of bed in the morning without you and 10 alarms he chooses not to because he knows you'll tell him when he really needs to get up.", "Omg, NTA. I hate people that do this. He\u2019s dragging you into his laziness. That\u2019s what this is. I don\u2019t even get it. Just set an alrm for an hour later. He\u2019s actually harming his sleep wellness by snoozing an alarm several times.\n\nIf he still isn\u2019t responding to normal tempered discourse, I would start getting real petty with it. Set an alarm every ten minutes for an hour before you go to sleep. Keep waking him up when he snoozes his alarm. Turn his alarm off yourself. Like he\u2019s not listening to you anyway, right?\n\nAnd a side note: as someone who lived deaf people for my entire childhood, vibrating alarm clocks are **not** less disruptive than audible ones. It will shake the whole damn house.", "NTA\n\nHoly hell I would be furious at this.

If it was a one-off, I'd say you need to just accept it, but this is going to drive you crazy. \n\nHe needs to, at a minimum, TRY to do better. Go to bed earlier? Put his alarm far enough from bed that he has to get up to snooze it? (though that might not help you out here...). Sleep in a different room?

He is unreasonable and selfish and doesn\u2019t care about your physical or mental well-being enough. This is not a light issue. Sleep deprivation will eventually make it impossible for you to work, cook, clean, care for kids and can genuinely lead to a breakdown.\n\nOur body needs proper sleep SO BAD or we legitimately can not function. First alarm and I\u2019d be spraying him down with ice water til he stands up. I\u2019d under no circumstances get him up myself after 10+ alarms again- right now he knows you will and sees no reason to change.", "NTA. Your husband doesn't respect you. He is showing you that every day. He could fix the problem in multiple different ways, but he is actively choosing to make you deal with it instead. Because he knows you will.", "NTA    tell hubby he gets up with the kids, or gets one snooze from his alarm, because right now he is being a selfish jerk. \n\nAsk him if you resenting him and being exhausted all the time, is what he thinks you signed up for when you got married, because if he thinks you did, he is very wrong. \n\nI am truly stumped by the fact that he isn't willing to find a solution for the situation, it makes him sound like a kid who doesn't want to get up for school, not someone with responsibilities. He needs to wake up and smell the coffee. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA but does he have good sleep habits otherwise? If yes then has he been checked for sleep disorders?  If not then his lack of willingness to explore the problem and possible solutions makes him the AH.", "NTA. It feels like your husband is stuck in a perpetual slumber, much like Spyro's nemesis, Gnasty Gnorc, causing chaos and disrupting the peace. His repeated failure to wake up for his alarms not only disturbs your sleep and that of your little dragons, but it also reflects a lack of consideration for his responsibilities and the impact it has on the family.\r  \n\r  \nYou've been patient and understanding, but it's clear that this pattern is taking a toll on you. It's important for him to acknowledge the problem and take proactive steps, just like Spyro gathering gems to save the day. Whether it's consulting a sleep specialist or investing in alternative alarm methods, he needs to make a genuine effort to address the issue and find a solution.\r  \n\r  \nCommunication is key in any relationship, so have an open and honest conversation with him about the impact his behavior is having on you and the household. Encourage him to take responsibility for his actions and work together to find a resolution that allows everyone to rest peacefully, just like Spyro saving the Dragon Realms from chaos and restoring tranquility.", "NTA is there a possibility to use different bedrooms? We used to do that when our shifts where so far apart and it worked for us...", "NTA I say turn off the alarm after the first snooze and let him suffer the consequences.  If he sees how it affects his job he might get it together.  Does he stay up late? That might affecting his waking up too.", "NTA.  He needs an alternate alarm.  There are vibrating and shocking wristbands as well as a potential headphone alarm.\n\nI am a deep sleeper and have my (standard) alarm clock across the room so I have to get up to snooze it.  If I was waking my husband up with this, I would definitely buy an alternate.  You may need to buy the alternate and then force him to use it.  He can't be waking up the whole house and expect to continue on that path.", "NTA - you know youre not an AH, your husband is a huge one though.", "He needs to understand the importance of healthy sleep hygiene & that he isn't the only one who needs to sleep. Nta, husband is being an ah.", "NTA Sounds like his mommy never let him grow up to be a big responsible boy", "You could try turning his alarms off and having a decent sleep. Keep doing this for a few days and his internal alarm will magically reset.", "Have you tried waking him with a kick up the butt? NTA", "NTA, and I think it is time to really press on getting a sleep study done. While the weaponized incompetance angle is definitely possible, I think the chance of a sleep disorder is very real, and an untreated sleep disorder can easily look like simple laziness. Does he have a relatively consistent \"bedtime\", or is he up all hours of the night?", "Nta\n\nMy husband used to do this. I would wake him up a couple times, then the third time I would tell him I wasn't going to wake him up again, so get up or shut the alarm off. He would grumble and drag himself out of bed.\n\nEventually hunting season rolled around and I stopped waking him up.
