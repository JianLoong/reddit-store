Every single day his alarms will go off every 5-10 minutes he won\u2019t wake up for them unless I wake him up then he will snooze them and we repeat the process. It is extremely frustrating and exhausting on my end because it wakes me and the children up at 5am and he ends up being late for work most days. To be honest it is making me have negative feelings about him, he won\u2019t try anything to fix it. I feel like he doesn\u2019t care that it wakes me and the kids up, it also wakes up our dog which then leads to me having to let her outside and then I\u2019m up way before I need to be taking care of the kids and the dogs. This wouldn\u2019t be a huge problem if he would wake up in the middle of the night when the kids wake up and need attention but he doesn\u2019t wake up for that either. So here I am going to bed after him, waking up multiple times throughout the night with the kids and waking up to his 5am alarm daily. Even on my days off.

Which one he is will depend on whether or not he wants to get better, as someone avoiding chores will not see a problem with the current arrangement. \n\n---- LONG post\n\nI know you didn't ask for it, but if it helps, here's what helped me not have to have 20 alarms that I just ignored: \n\n1) have less alarms. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but having fewer let me remember what time they were and how long I had to get up. I have one to jostle me awake, and another that's a 15min warning for me getting up and getting ready comfortably without rushing. \n\n2) go to sleep SOONER than you need to, by an hour or more. I have trouble falling asleep, so I pair this with a sleep aid, like melatonin. Taking the aid 10hrs before my shift starts is what works for me (9:30-10pm for 8am shift), but I've tried 12hrs before. It can take 1-2hrs to kick in, and then he's got to be IN bed. Too much excitement when it's supposed to kick in, and the adrenaline overpowers it. Taking another at this point may make him oversleep. \n\n3) plan the afternoon before. I take lunches to work, so I do a little meal prep the day before so I can pack it in the morning. Pre-packaged stuff gets tossed in the box right away. Get the coffee ready to start. If I'm gonna be outside, check the weather and have my outfit set out. These combine to shave a lot of time on my morning routine, so he won't have to get up as early. \n\n4) order the chores where they can take up the least amount of time. Things that take time can be started simultaneously, or started as a more involved chore takes place. Pour the dog food, use the bathroom. Start the coffee as you take the dog out, start toasting the waffles as you take her back to the room. This cools my coffee to the temperature I like, too, so if he likes his hotter, find a different spot to start it. \n\n5) REMEMBER THE DRIVE TO WORK. ALWAYS give yourself an extra 10min headstart to begin your commute. Sometimes traffic is bad, sometimes I forget to grab things before I have to head out the door, but it's nicer to be a little early and fiddle on my phone then be late and rushing. I'm close enough to walk if the weather's nice, so I get that little bonus if I'm not running late. \n\n6) hardest for me to do, the math. Remember how long things take, tally it up to know what time you HAVE to get up, and long you'd like to have to wake up. I HAVE to get up at 7, I like to wake up around 6, so I have a 6am and a 6:45 alarm for my 8am shift. \n\n\nI don't have kids. I do have a dog, 2 cats, and ADHD. I'm not always able to do everything on my routine, and there's certainly more that could be added if I got up earlier. But I know what I can and cant do in time that I have, including lazing about. If he wants to change and pull his weight, he needs to figure out where he can go right, because you're already telling him where he's going wrong. Good luck, and don't take shit. If the worst he can do is leave, he was already on the road to lose his job anyway, and he WON'T get better after that. I dontbsee this guy being a SAHD, but you know him better if he can or would.", "NTA for all the reasons other commenters shared.\n\nYou said you kind of want advice, too. If your partner is just being selfish, there aren\u2019t good ways to fix it without him. But if he\u2019s just struggling to wake up, here\u2019s some things that help me get up as the most anti-morning person ever.\n\n1 - Switching out rock/metal alarm tones so I won\u2019t get used to ignoring them (see 3) - I\u2019m currently using the intro from Down with the Sickness, which is impossible to ignore. I\u2019ve heard people suggest songs that start quiet-ish and get louder and turn into rock, like Iron Swan by The Sword, but I do better with alarms that start loud and annoying so I wake up with a small adrenaline jolt. Sadly this will wake you up too, but probably not as much as your current situation wakes you up.\n\n2 - Some sort of a note reminding myself why I need to get up. Bonus points if you include some sort of insult for a drill-sergeant-waking-you-up vibe (my most effective alarm is the one that says \u201cmeds you dumbass,\u201d since I have meds I have to take before a certain time each morning).\n\n3 - *Setting an alarm for when I really and truly need to get up*, not for when it would be nice to get up. If I learn I can ignore or snooze my alarm, I\u2019ll turn it off without even waking up, but if I can never ignore it I\u2019ll develop a habit of getting up right away. Edit to add: if he\u2019s not getting up with his current alarm and still makes it to work on time, his alarm can move later. In the future he should probably move it back so he has some extra time in case of emergencies, but if he\u2019s not getting up until he has to rush around\u2026 maybe it\u2019s time to cut y\u2019all\u2019s collective losses and have him set his actual alarm for when he actually gets up. It sucks but might be a practical solution for now.", "The problem isn't he isn't waking up for his alarms but it's the fact he isn't trying to do anything about it, isn't getting up with his kids at night and seems to be extremely unapologetic about it. You are definitely NTA!", "Warn him, one time, he starts getting up on his own or you'll get him up, and he won't like it. When he inevitably fails to do so, train him like a our drill sergeants trained us. You simultaneously flip on the lights and throw a metal trash can while screaming  \"on your feet!!\" Make sure you warn the kids beforehand.", "NTA since he is a big baby and won\u2019t go to the doctor, relies on your likes you\u2019re his mommy, and refuses to try other alarms \u2014 he\u2019s perfectly happy being an unreliable burden. Man, I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like having children with someone who doesn\u2019t even care about them or me. Good luck.\n\nIf you can\u2019t rely on adult to get themselves up and not deprive other people of sleep (a need), I can\u2019t imagine how he\u2019s going to handle it when life throws a crisis your way. He\u2019d probably make it worse somehow.", "NTA - I'm your wife, not your mother. I need you to do this for yourself. I've got enough children as it is.", "He is being a massive, massive, MASSIVE, asshole. Full stop, nothing else to say.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Is it possible to send him back to his mum for home training?", "NTA. Can you sleep in a spare room if possible?", "\"She divorced me because I left dishes by the sink\"\n\nI've seen other people suggest this to read and I think it's really helpful. \n\nIt's about the alarm, but also not about the alarm.\n\nOP: read this and then have your husband do the same:\n\nhttps://matthewfray.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/", "I had a similar issue with my husband. I felt like it was my responsibility to wake him up or he would be late or lose his job. This would cause me a lot of anxiety and stress. Once I started focusing on myself and managing my anxiety, I realized I was enabling him. So do you know what I did, I stoped waking him up. It wasn\u2019t easy at first but somehow he magically got his shit together and got up on time. He realized that he could no longer depend on me and he needed to start going to bed earlier so he was more rested in the morning. \n\nSo here\u2019s my suggestion for you, start sleeping in the living room. If you don\u2019t already, set up a white noise machine/app in your kids room. This way the alarm won\u2019t disturb them. You\u2019re out in the living room and do not wake him up or tell him to cut off his alarm. You may want to use white noise for yourself too. When it\u2019s time for you to get up, start your normal routine and don\u2019t engage with him. If he\u2019s late, not your problem. If he\u2019s still asleep when you leave, oh well \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. He continues to do this everyday because he hasn\u2019t had a consequence. There is nothing negative happening to him that is forcing him to change his behavior. He\u2019s going to get upset and blame you if he\u2019s late or worse. But put it right back on him \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to wake you up in the morning. You refuse to get help or make any changes, so whatever the consequences are\u2026deal with it\u201d. \n\nAlso, make him get up to help at night. It\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re expected to night parent alone. Physically wake him up if you have too or cut on the lights. Again, he needs to experience some consequences.", "NTA I would maybe tell Husband that you get up at 6.30 and he's in charte of the children between 5 and 6.30. If the kids wake up then you wake husband and tell him he's woken them and he's in charge now.", "Start waking him up when the kids cry tell him it's his turn. He's not waking up because he has a human alarm he can rely on. Stop waking him up for work. For the time being, look at this as an opportunity to use that extra hour to meditate, workout, take time to shower and start your day slowly. \n\nYou've been compliant in his inability to wake up. You are being responsible, yes but you're also shooting yourself in the foot by waking up with the kids and waking him up for work. If need be stay with family and friends for a while let him deal with the kids for a few days, if that isn't safe take them with you. Once his job in in jeopardy I'm sure he'll straighten up. \n\nNTA", "I feel like people are being a bit dramatic. Talk to him about it first lol, tell him that you\u2019re feeling very frustrated and it\u2019s beginning to make you resent him since he\u2019s not pulling his share with the kids and making you wake him up. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to feel like it\u2019s a small thing but make it clear it\u2019s really starting to take a toll and he needs to change things up if he doesn\u2019t want this to start seriously affecting the relationship", "NTA. He is an adult and should be able to get himself up each day.\n\nI understand he may be a heavy sleeper but you may have to compromise and set one alarm which wakes you up and then you can kick him out of the bed.\n\nOne chance, Or he can be late, he will soon learn.", "Can you attach the alarm to headphones and put them on his head the first time it goes off? Then you can go back to sleep and he can deal with it.", "NTA. I had similar fights with my husband some years ago. He's a heavy sleeper and doesn't wake up to his alarms either. But we came up with a system where I set a quiet alarm that doesn't wake the kids but does wake me. Then I wake him up. Sometimes he asks me to snooze it and he get 5-15 extra minutes. But it's SOMETIMES and only 15 minutes max. Your husband may not be able to help being a heavy sleeper, but he can help being a jerk. He can get up so the alarm isnt going off all morning. And he can take the dog out when him waking up wakes up the dog.", "NTA- I am betting this is not the only selfish thing he does in your relationship.", "NTA and it\u2019s time for an ugly fight.\n\nYou\u2019re not allowed to sleep through the night, you\u2019re not allowed to sleep in the morning.

He\u2019s almost certainly on thin ice at work. \n\nSo: you work, don\u2019t sleep, take care of the kids and the dog, wake him up, and you\u2019re not allowed to complain or demand he do better.  \n\nAbsolutely fucking not. \n\nHe has unilaterally made choices for you. Now you are making them for him. You are getting a powerful alarm, he *is* going to use it. And if he tries to whine and cry and pout, he\u2019s getting an earful.\n \nI deeply urge you to look inside, and find the power of a 1960s cigarette mom, her hair in curlers with a tumbler and a cigarette at 8am, screaming at her husband to get it together. And bring that energy home.", "Get a spray bottle and spritz his face with ice water every time his alarm goes off, like training a cat.", "There are alarms that will literally shake the bed to get you up. He can have that for his next birthday or Christmas whichever comes first. You can find one on Amazon prime.

I would have a serious talk to see what can be done. And honestly I would share a room with one of the kids for a week at first to show you\u2019re serious. Or maybe banish him to the couch until he can fix this on his own. You\u2019re better than I am. If this was me I would wake him up with cold water or he\u2019d wake up on the floor every morning.

If so that might be something you want to consider if this behavior doesn't stop.", "NTA.

You said it yourself; Here you are going to bed after him, waking up multiple times for the kids completely on your own (which in itself makes him an AH, by the way), then waking up at 5 AM to his multiple alarms.

This is a person who knows you are living in this hell, and will not even entertain something as minuscule as \u2018getting a fancy alarm clock that vibrates\u2019?

Because they didn't realize how much of their time went into taking care of and cleaning up after their useless husband. With their husband gone, they're only responsible for their children, which ends up being a significantly lighter load. \n\nNot saying you should divorce him.
