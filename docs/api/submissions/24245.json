Ask your  husband how he would feel if his daughter drowned because he prioritized drinking with his buddies over the safety of his child.  Stick to your instincts.", "NTA.\n\nI'm from Australia where child drownings were a serious problem, until we put serious effort into separating unsupervised kids from water (mainly with pool fences). Basically if there's a body of water and a young kid, you need an adult watching them 100% of the time. That's not an exaggeration. You can't look away even for a moment. It's so tragic when a kid drowns and the person who was \"watching\" them says I \"just looked away for a moment\". It's a level of vigilance most adults don't normally have to do. Adults often get distracted, especially when talking to other people.\n\nI don't think your husband or his parents appreciate the risk. Your husband doesn't want his parents to feel like they can't be trusted, but you've mentioned real risk factors here. The fact they are minimising the risk is a real worry\n\nyour husband saying \"they'd never do that\" is meaningless. Nobody purposefully lets a child drown. It's something that happens quietly while adults are looking elsewhere. They might be sorry if your child drowns on their watch, but the child will still be dead.\n\nHold the line on this. The only measure that 100% secures child from water is a fence.", "You child is 18 months old, and the way you describe your In-Laws, they can't help if the worse incident could happen.\n\nI have no idea how deep the canal is.

The parents must have been awful, neglectful parents, no one was watching the kid at all, because we like to take comfort in the idea that it wouldn't happen to us with our children or when watching a child. \n\nThe reality, is, most of these accidents happen to people who do love the children they are watching, and aren't like high on meth while watching the child. That's why there are fences around pools, baby gates, even the little backpack leashes, because shit happens. Kids can suddenly run like cheetahs (seen it), they can open doors that they never could before, and they have a unique ability to seek out the only dangerous item in the entire home within their reach. \n\nThat canal is actively dangerous to your child at this time in their life, that's just a reality of having a small child. Add to that the caretakers can't keep up with the kid, and all it takes is grandma turning her back when the door is open for a real tragedy to strike.", "NTA.

As a parent, those worries are justified. Id do the same if my in-laws were like that. Heck, id not let anyone hold my baby or just have babysit my child unless its someone reliable and one that can be trusted with the child.", "I don't understand why your FIL doesn't want the fence. He can remove after x amount of years. Your kid is only 18months and that fence should be there for up to 5 years or more (depending from the kid) so it's not like it's a trouble putting it now and then removing it after 6months. \n\nBy the description of your IL it seems that if your daughter is outside, they can't run after her all the time. \n\nNTA - You need to put your foot down on this one. It only takes a second for a toddler to wonder off. I know, I was that toddler and I got hit by a car when I was 3yo. My mum had to idea, no cell phones back then and just saw my dad speeding away and my one shoe in the middle of the street. I can't imagine her shock.", "Hard NTA. You\u2019d never forgive yourself.

It's a matter of safety and a lack of respecting reasonable boundaries.", "HUGE NTA \n\nThe phrase \"That'll never happen.\" is the easiest to say but hardest to maintain when it comes to instances that are out of our control. Do not live your life in absolutes if you can't positively back them up. \n\nYou need to set this boundary in stone. Be more harsh about the consequences of their laid back attitude about the fence. Talk about the elephant in the room. It's better to be overdramatic about this than to be underwhelming and lose a child. Children can drown in the bathtub with you right next to them. A canal with no fence in place is just a matter of time. \n\nStick to your guns, Mama. Your instincts are screaming at you for a reason. I'd rather people laugh at me for the rest of my child's life over how dramatic I am about safety than have something happen that could have been prevented.", "Nta,  die on this hill", "NTA\n\nSo I have a deep fear of small children near water sources, after my dog drowned in a river at my parents' house. I was the one who had to pull his little body out.\n\nI also had a toddler who was a runner and who would disappear the moment you turned your back. I had to teach him my phone number at age 2ish and to \"find a mommy and ask her to call me\" because he would get separated from people so often. \n\nSo when my kids were little, I was hyper vigilant at the pool, at houses with exposed water ways, etc. We filled in a koi pond in our back yard because I was too scared. \n\nI even get on alert with strangers' little kids. \n\nSo, no, 100% NTA", "NTA. Nothing trumps protecting an 18 month old. Your husband is foolish to imagine his toddler cannot get away from his frail parents and go straight down into that canal. Kids are so quick, and they always go straight to the one place you want them to stay away from. They're like dogs in that way! We have 2/3 an acre that is fenced, with one spot in the entire yard that has a gap just big enough for a dog to get through, and though that gap is well hidden by some bushes, never have we had a dog visit that it didn't go straight for that one spot, as if they could smell it. We had to hog wire it off. Children are attracted to water, and to any forbidden place, and are quick to play chase, especially with adults who cannot catch them. She'd be over that bank in a heartbeat.", "NTA.   I would have the same concerns.   A fence would be wonderful.  But, you can't make them put up a fence.  A fence would set my mind at ease.   Talk to them.  I'd have them come to my home to watch your baby.     Be polite and ask for understanding.", "they wont save your daughter from drowning. if they even notice it in the first place. TRUST YOUR GUT. NTA", "NTA. No one ever intentionally has a child drown while in their care. All it takes is a few seconds. Your in-laws feeling don\u2019t matter in this equation.

Not saying your ILs should do that, but a fence is a good start. Also, having them in poor health doesn\u2019t help the situation because you need quick reflexes with a toddler", "NTA. This is EXACTLY the kind of thing you should dig in your heels about. You hit the nail on the head when you said this is something you don't want to end up right about. \n\nIf they won't watch her at your house, they don't get to watch her. Your daughter's safety, HER LIFE, is more important than your husband's friend's party. \n\nI'm 35 and have 3 kids and know how fast they can get into dangerous situations. Don't risk it.", "NTA, for sure. This is an incredible dangerous setting for a small child. And the thing is: children drown silently. They fall in and that's it. There is no thrashing or shouting. They fall in and just petrify and are gone. I've witnessed this, we saw the fall of our friends kid into the pool while moving into the vacation home. Running there he just floated somehow peacefully downwards. No resistance, it was such an eerie thing to watch. Of course he was rescued. But If nobody would have seen this boy fall into the pool - I really don't want to think about it.\nIt was a lection for all of us.\nPlease follow your gut feeling and don't let the little girl alone with the grandparents, unless a fence has been build.", "NTA, if something happened you would never forgive yourself or them. They should really consider building that fence. However, if they are not willing to do that, would a compromise be: while outside your daughter is required to wear a lifejacket at all times?

Either way, you need to do what is right by your child.", "When my eldest was 18 months, we moved into a house with a garden that gives onto a canal. I\u2019d gone to a DIY center a couple of days before were given the key and bought fencing, posts, a gate, the lot. Had it stacked and asked them to deliver on the day of transfer. The next day the first thing I did, together with a friend, was to put the fence up. The lock to the gate was on the canal side and out of reach of little hands. I also deliberately made it to fit so that it would be stiff.

So *you* object to OP \"removing on of the sitters\" - which are the in-laws - which are the exact same people who have a canal without fencing - who see no danger in babysitting an 18 months old child - who do not see any possibility of a child drowning in said canal, even though (as OP stated),\n\n> their overall health meaning they can\u2019t react quick to situation\n\n/s\n\nThe main problem is still - the husband bailed, the husband needs to find an acceptable sitter.\n\nAlso, OP posted this:\n\n> It\u2019s usually a two yes or or one no situation.

There have already been other instances. IL\u2019s are not trusted guardians until OP\u2019s kid has a sense of self preservation.\n\nI went through this with my in laws, and it was hell.

Absolute 1000% agreed.  \n\nBut.  It can provide valuable extra time to get to the precious little demons so they don\u2019t drown.  \n\nPhysical barriers are not enough on their own.  Supervision by a physically limited (and dismissive!) caregiver is also not nearly enough.  \n\nEven with the best of supervision and proper physical barriers, horrible & tragic accidents STILL happen.  It\u2019s imperative to reduce risk in every single way possible.", "Not necessarily, if it's a decently high fence with nothing near it for climbing on then it would stop a young toddler, though obviously they should still be supervised. Being inside a house isn't that hard to get out of because, well you're meant to be able to, there's doors and windows but if it's just a tall fence with no gate it's much harder because there's no intended point of passing through. If that makes sense?", "Just because a fence isn\u2019t 100% effective in preventing drowning doesn\u2019t mean it is worthless.", "What I'm really driving at is that the fence isn't the actual issue. It's an excuse. Pretending like if they'd just get a fence everything would be okay is silly and dishonest.", "Not saying all are great. Some judges suck. But if OP has a good lawyer hopefully that will help mitigate that problem", "I don\u2019t think anyone is saying that it\u2019s solely the fence. \n\nIf they had readily recognized that an unsecured CANAL (what are the physical properties there even - do they have any sort of pier? Boats/dinghy/any watercraft? Do people take watercraft in the canal & who has access to the IL\u2019s yard through that unsecured canal?) is a MASSIVE hazard & agreed to take (and then actually installed) the proper precautions, that\u2019s a different story.  \n\nBut what parent is going to rely on a toddler \u201cneeding\u201d to stay inside and the very questionable supervision of someone (FIL specifically) that will not take that very basic and logical precaution and cannot physically supervise the child sufficiently?   Would you stake your child\u2019s LIFE on that?  \n\nDoing everything you can to keep your child from DYING is literally your main job as a parent.  Taking proper precautions to that end doesn\u2019t make you a helicopter parent.  It makes you a GOOD parent. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a parent that is pushing back on gramma and grampa giving too many cookies or letting them be a little riskier in the sandbox.  This is an unsecured water source and the refusal to do anything about it.  THAT is what this is about.  \n\nRefusing a widely accepted (and legally required, depending on location) way to greatly reduce the risk of a supposedly beloved child from drowning is the reddest of red flags.  \n\nRight there, it shows that they are refusing to institute the most basic of safety precautions because they think they know best.  Even though a toddler that loves the water is going to be constantly trying to get to it, that\u2019s what they do.  \n\nThey are not in any physical shape to run after a toddler on the loose.  Would either be able to jump in the canal and pull out a drowning toddler?  \n\nIs their house childproofed? Can they lock the doors securely?  It takes SECONDS for a child to unlock a door and peace out.  Drownings are typically very quiet affairs, especially with young children.  That child could be out the door and in the canal before a tv commercial is even over. \n\nA properly installed and sufficiently designed fence is a much more efficient barrier than grandma & grandpa\u2019s back door, which they may or may not even be in the habit of closing/locking, given that they do not have small children living in the house. \n\nIL\u2019s are absolutely within their rights to not put up a fence.  But OP is absolutely within her rights (and obligations) to safeguard her child.  And the consequence of that is they don\u2019t get unsupervised access to their grandchild in an inexcusably unsafe environment. \n\nAs I say often to my toddler, and my parents said to me often growing up, you are free to make your own decisions.  You just get to live with the consequences.  OP is not willing to live with the consequences of IL\u2019s decision.  Good for her AND their child.", "I was speaking broadly, I've seen it far too often where one parent has a \"It will never happen to *ME.*\" mindset and repeatedly makes poor parenting choices. Leaving the child under the care of people who are incapable of responding quickly while placing the child in a situation where responding quickly is an absolutely necessity is a poor parenting choice. A playpen or supervision by physically capable people are both reasonable solutions, the husband hasn't bothered to think of or present any reasonable solutions."]}
