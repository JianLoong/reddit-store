Ask your  husband how he would feel if his daughter drowned because he prioritized drinking with his buddies over the safety of his child.  Stick to your instincts.", "NTA.\n\nI'm from Australia where child drownings were a serious problem, until we put serious effort into separating unsupervised kids from water (mainly with pool fences). Basically if there's a body of water and a young kid, you need an adult watching them 100% of the time. That's not an exaggeration. You can't look away even for a moment. It's so tragic when a kid drowns and the person who was \"watching\" them says I \"just looked away for a moment\". It's a level of vigilance most adults don't normally have to do. Adults often get distracted, especially when talking to other people.\n\nI don't think your husband or his parents appreciate the risk. Your husband doesn't want his parents to feel like they can't be trusted, but you've mentioned real risk factors here. The fact they are minimising the risk is a real worry\n\nyour husband saying \"they'd never do that\" is meaningless. Nobody purposefully lets a child drown. It's something that happens quietly while adults are looking elsewhere. They might be sorry if your child drowns on their watch, but the child will still be dead.\n\nHold the line on this. The only measure that 100% secures child from water is a fence.", "You child is 18 months old, and the way you describe your In-Laws, they can't help if the worse incident could happen.\n\nI have no idea how deep the canal is.

The parents must have been awful, neglectful parents, no one was watching the kid at all, because we like to take comfort in the idea that it wouldn't happen to us with our children or when watching a child. \n\nThe reality, is, most of these accidents happen to people who do love the children they are watching, and aren't like high on meth while watching the child. That's why there are fences around pools, baby gates, even the little backpack leashes, because shit happens. Kids can suddenly run like cheetahs (seen it), they can open doors that they never could before, and they have a unique ability to seek out the only dangerous item in the entire home within their reach. \n\nThat canal is actively dangerous to your child at this time in their life, that's just a reality of having a small child. Add to that the caretakers can't keep up with the kid, and all it takes is grandma turning her back when the door is open for a real tragedy to strike.", "NTA.

As a parent, those worries are justified. Id do the same if my in-laws were like that. Heck, id not let anyone hold my baby or just have babysit my child unless its someone reliable and one that can be trusted with the child.", "I don't understand why your FIL doesn't want the fence. He can remove after x amount of years. Your kid is only 18months and that fence should be there for up to 5 years or more (depending from the kid) so it's not like it's a trouble putting it now and then removing it after 6months. \n\nBy the description of your IL it seems that if your daughter is outside, they can't run after her all the time. \n\nNTA - You need to put your foot down on this one. It only takes a second for a toddler to wonder off. I know, I was that toddler and I got hit by a car when I was 3yo. My mum had to idea, no cell phones back then and just saw my dad speeding away and my one shoe in the middle of the street. I can't imagine her shock.", "Hard NTA. You\u2019d never forgive yourself.

It's a matter of safety and a lack of respecting reasonable boundaries.", "HUGE NTA \n\nThe phrase \"That'll never happen.\" is the easiest to say but hardest to maintain when it comes to instances that are out of our control. Do not live your life in absolutes if you can't positively back them up. \n\nYou need to set this boundary in stone. Be more harsh about the consequences of their laid back attitude about the fence. Talk about the elephant in the room. It's better to be overdramatic about this than to be underwhelming and lose a child. Children can drown in the bathtub with you right next to them. A canal with no fence in place is just a matter of time. \n\nStick to your guns, Mama. Your instincts are screaming at you for a reason. I'd rather people laugh at me for the rest of my child's life over how dramatic I am about safety than have something happen that could have been prevented.", "Nta,  die on this hill", "NTA\n\nSo I have a deep fear of small children near water sources, after my dog drowned in a river at my parents' house. I was the one who had to pull his little body out.\n\nI also had a toddler who was a runner and who would disappear the moment you turned your back. I had to teach him my phone number at age 2ish and to \"find a mommy and ask her to call me\" because he would get separated from people so often. \n\nSo when my kids were little, I was hyper vigilant at the pool, at houses with exposed water ways, etc. We filled in a koi pond in our back yard because I was too scared. \n\nI even get on alert with strangers' little kids. \n\nSo, no, 100% NTA", "NTA. Nothing trumps protecting an 18 month old. Your husband is foolish to imagine his toddler cannot get away from his frail parents and go straight down into that canal. Kids are so quick, and they always go straight to the one place you want them to stay away from. They're like dogs in that way! We have 2/3 an acre that is fenced, with one spot in the entire yard that has a gap just big enough for a dog to get through, and though that gap is well hidden by some bushes, never have we had a dog visit that it didn't go straight for that one spot, as if they could smell it. We had to hog wire it off. Children are attracted to water, and to any forbidden place, and are quick to play chase, especially with adults who cannot catch them. She'd be over that bank in a heartbeat.", "NTA.   I would have the same concerns.   A fence would be wonderful.  But, you can't make them put up a fence.  A fence would set my mind at ease.   Talk to them.  I'd have them come to my home to watch your baby.     Be polite and ask for understanding.", "they wont save your daughter from drowning. if they even notice it in the first place. TRUST YOUR GUT. NTA", "NTA. No one ever intentionally has a child drown while in their care. All it takes is a few seconds. Your in-laws feeling don\u2019t matter in this equation.

Not saying your ILs should do that, but a fence is a good start. Also, having them in poor health doesn\u2019t help the situation because you need quick reflexes with a toddler", "NTA. This is EXACTLY the kind of thing you should dig in your heels about. You hit the nail on the head when you said this is something you don't want to end up right about. \n\nIf they won't watch her at your house, they don't get to watch her. Your daughter's safety, HER LIFE, is more important than your husband's friend's party. \n\nI'm 35 and have 3 kids and know how fast they can get into dangerous situations. Don't risk it.", "NTA, for sure. This is an incredible dangerous setting for a small child. And the thing is: children drown silently. They fall in and that's it. There is no thrashing or shouting. They fall in and just petrify and are gone. I've witnessed this, we saw the fall of our friends kid into the pool while moving into the vacation home. Running there he just floated somehow peacefully downwards. No resistance, it was such an eerie thing to watch. Of course he was rescued. But If nobody would have seen this boy fall into the pool - I really don't want to think about it.\nIt was a lection for all of us.\nPlease follow your gut feeling and don't let the little girl alone with the grandparents, unless a fence has been build.", "NTA, if something happened you would never forgive yourself or them. They should really consider building that fence. However, if they are not willing to do that, would a compromise be: while outside your daughter is required to wear a lifejacket at all times?

Either way, you need to do what is right by your child.", "When my eldest was 18 months, we moved into a house with a garden that gives onto a canal. I\u2019d gone to a DIY center a couple of days before were given the key and bought fencing, posts, a gate, the lot. Had it stacked and asked them to deliver on the day of transfer. The next day the first thing I did, together with a friend, was to put the fence up. The lock to the gate was on the canal side and out of reach of little hands. I also deliberately made it to fit so that it would be stiff.

As a toddler, my younger son was very impulsive, and would dart off at the least notice, to the point that, until he was about 4yo and had learned some measure of impulse control, we had to keep him in a chest harness with a lead that clipped on in the middle of his back where he couldn't reach it. (That was Version 2; Version 1 had to be discarded because the clip was high enough for him to undo it -- and he did.)\n\nWe got a *lot* of dirty looks from other people, and some snide comments, too, about keeping our kid on a leash \"like a dog\".

Phone or doorbell rings? You have a pressing need to go to pee? You put your sunglasses on? Oh where is the sunscreen, it's time to reapply in on baby's sensitive skin. All and any of these distractions, and a thousand more, could cause anyone to take their eyes of a toddler for a couple of seconds, which could be enough for the worst to happen.\n\n In the US, drowning is the first cause of death in kids age 1-4.
