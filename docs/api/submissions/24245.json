Ask your  husband how he would feel if his daughter drowned because he prioritized drinking with his buddies over the safety of his child.  Stick to your instincts.", "NTA.\n\nI'm from Australia where child drownings were a serious problem, until we put serious effort into separating unsupervised kids from water (mainly with pool fences). Basically if there's a body of water and a young kid, you need an adult watching them 100% of the time. That's not an exaggeration. You can't look away even for a moment. It's so tragic when a kid drowns and the person who was \"watching\" them says I \"just looked away for a moment\". It's a level of vigilance most adults don't normally have to do. Adults often get distracted, especially when talking to other people.\n\nI don't think your husband or his parents appreciate the risk. Your husband doesn't want his parents to feel like they can't be trusted, but you've mentioned real risk factors here. The fact they are minimising the risk is a real worry\n\nyour husband saying \"they'd never do that\" is meaningless. Nobody purposefully lets a child drown. It's something that happens quietly while adults are looking elsewhere. They might be sorry if your child drowns on their watch, but the child will still be dead.\n\nHold the line on this. The only measure that 100% secures child from water is a fence.", "You child is 18 months old, and the way you describe your In-Laws, they can't help if the worse incident could happen.\n\nI have no idea how deep the canal is.  But with an obese person, and a person undergoing cancer treatment, they mayn't be able to react fast enough.\n\nYour hard boundary is needed.  Your MIL can come to your house if your husband wants her to baby sit.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband sounds like every person being interviewed post tragedy. Don't bend on this. Either your in laws watch your child in your home or have able bodies babysitters at your in laws. If they take offense it's only because they can't come to terms with the reality in their face.", "NTA. \n\nWhen we all read the stories of accidents- drowning in a pool, kid going missing, kid hit by a car, etc. - we like to think that someone did something actively wrong. The parents must have been awful, neglectful parents, no one was watching the kid at all, because we like to take comfort in the idea that it wouldn't happen to us with our children or when watching a child. \n\nThe reality, is, most of these accidents happen to people who do love the children they are watching, and aren't like high on meth while watching the child. That's why there are fences around pools, baby gates, even the little backpack leashes, because shit happens. Kids can suddenly run like cheetahs (seen it), they can open doors that they never could before, and they have a unique ability to seek out the only dangerous item in the entire home within their reach. \n\nThat canal is actively dangerous to your child at this time in their life, that's just a reality of having a small child. Add to that the caretakers can't keep up with the kid, and all it takes is grandma turning her back when the door is open for a real tragedy to strike.", "NTA.

As a parent, those worries are justified. Id do the same if my in-laws were like that. Heck, id not let anyone hold my baby or just have babysit my child unless its someone reliable and one that can be trusted with the child.", "I don't understand why your FIL doesn't want the fence. He can remove after x amount of years. Your kid is only 18months and that fence should be there for up to 5 years or more (depending from the kid) so it's not like it's a trouble putting it now and then removing it after 6months. \n\nBy the description of your IL it seems that if your daughter is outside, they can't run after her all the time. \n\nNTA - You need to put your foot down on this one. It only takes a second for a toddler to wonder off. I know, I was that toddler and I got hit by a car when I was 3yo. My mum had to idea, no cell phones back then and just saw my dad speeding away and my one shoe in the middle of the street. I can't imagine her shock.", "Hard NTA. You\u2019d never forgive yourself.

It's a matter of safety and a lack of respecting reasonable boundaries.", "HUGE NTA \n\nThe phrase \"That'll never happen.\" is the easiest to say but hardest to maintain when it comes to instances that are out of our control. Do not live your life in absolutes if you can't positively back them up. \n\nYou need to set this boundary in stone. Be more harsh about the consequences of their laid back attitude about the fence. Talk about the elephant in the room. It's better to be overdramatic about this than to be underwhelming and lose a child. Children can drown in the bathtub with you right next to them. A canal with no fence in place is just a matter of time. \n\nStick to your guns, Mama. Your instincts are screaming at you for a reason. I'd rather people laugh at me for the rest of my child's life over how dramatic I am about safety than have something happen that could have been prevented.", "Nta,  die on this hill", "NTA\n\nSo I have a deep fear of small children near water sources, after my dog drowned in a river at my parents' house. I was the one who had to pull his little body out.\n\nI also had a toddler who was a runner and who would disappear the moment you turned your back. I had to teach him my phone number at age 2ish and to \"find a mommy and ask her to call me\" because he would get separated from people so often. \n\nSo when my kids were little, I was hyper vigilant at the pool, at houses with exposed water ways, etc. We filled in a koi pond in our back yard because I was too scared. \n\nI even get on alert with strangers' little kids. \n\nSo, no, 100% NTA", "NTA. Nothing trumps protecting an 18 month old. Your husband is foolish to imagine his toddler cannot get away from his frail parents and go straight down into that canal. Kids are so quick, and they always go straight to the one place you want them to stay away from. They're like dogs in that way! We have 2/3 an acre that is fenced, with one spot in the entire yard that has a gap just big enough for a dog to get through, and though that gap is well hidden by some bushes, never have we had a dog visit that it didn't go straight for that one spot, as if they could smell it. We had to hog wire it off. Children are attracted to water, and to any forbidden place, and are quick to play chase, especially with adults who cannot catch them. She'd be over that bank in a heartbeat.", "NTA.   I would have the same concerns.   A fence would be wonderful.  But, you can't make them put up a fence.  A fence would set my mind at ease.   Talk to them.  I'd have them come to my home to watch your baby.     Be polite and ask for understanding.", "they wont save your daughter from drowning. if they even notice it in the first place. TRUST YOUR GUT. NTA", "NTA. No one ever intentionally has a child drown while in their care. All it takes is a few seconds. Your in-laws feeling don\u2019t matter in this equation. Your husband needs to get on board and support you\u2026 more importantly he needs to support your daughter\u2026 and not his parents.\nWhat the hell is the matter with him?", "Are you kidding?

Grandma can come to your house and babysit there", "NTA If love and good intentions alone kept children safe, there\u2019d be a lot less parents with an empty bed or crib tonight.", "NTA, my parents literally moved house to be away from a canal because of my mum\u2019s fear of me drowning (I loved water and definitely would have jumped in) and how common it is. Not saying your ILs should do that, but a fence is a good start. Also, having them in poor health doesn\u2019t help the situation because you need quick reflexes with a toddler", "NTA. This is EXACTLY the kind of thing you should dig in your heels about. You hit the nail on the head when you said this is something you don't want to end up right about. \n\nIf they won't watch her at your house, they don't get to watch her. Your daughter's safety, HER LIFE, is more important than your husband's friend's party. \n\nI'm 35 and have 3 kids and know how fast they can get into dangerous situations. Don't risk it.", "NTA, for sure. This is an incredible dangerous setting for a small child. And the thing is: children drown silently. They fall in and that's it. There is no thrashing or shouting. They fall in and just petrify and are gone. I've witnessed this, we saw the fall of our friends kid into the pool while moving into the vacation home. Running there he just floated somehow peacefully downwards. No resistance, it was such an eerie thing to watch. Of course he was rescued. But If nobody would have seen this boy fall into the pool - I really don't want to think about it.\nIt was a lection for all of us.\nPlease follow your gut feeling and don't let the little girl alone with the grandparents, unless a fence has been build.", "NTA, if something happened you would never forgive yourself or them. They should really consider building that fence. However, if they are not willing to do that, would a compromise be: while outside your daughter is required to wear a lifejacket at all times?

Either way, you need to do what is right by your child.", "When my eldest was 18 months, we moved into a house with a garden that gives onto a canal. I\u2019d gone to a DIY center a couple of days before were given the key and bought fencing, posts, a gate, the lot. Had it stacked and asked them to deliver on the day of transfer. The next day the first thing I did, together with a friend, was to put the fence up. The lock to the gate was on the canal side and out of reach of little hands.

It can happen really fast even if you are watching them.\n\nNTA OP, and I think this is your hill to die on, don't let them watch her alone until they have put up a fence. Even people without the challenges your in-laws have (cancer, obesity) have lost toddlers/kids to accidental drownings.", "A fence and still an adult should always supervise... I have seen the little monsters climb things I would have never thought they could...", "A person can drown in just a few inches of water.", ">I have no idea how deep the canal is.\n\nIt doesn't really matter the depth, babies and young children can drown in as little as 2 inches of water.  Even if the grandparents were fit and healthy it's not a risk worth taking.  It only takes a moment of distraction and the child could die or have life long injuries/disabilities.  OP is definitely NTA.", "Highly doubt the GPs would stick to that if they\u2019re already dismissing OPs concerns and misjudging their own physical capabilities. \nIt would be a great compromise with ppl you can trust, however! Those ppl aren\u2019t it though", "the only baby sitter we know/use isn\u2019t available Saturdays and he\u2019s only just found out about his friends plan. And it would be too close to the event to introduce a new baby sitter we found online to her (it\u2019s this weekend).", "I completely agree that it\u2019s the husband\u2019s turn to watch the kid. However, I\u2019m concerned about the fact that they\u2019re not on the same page in this situation. OP has mentioned her concerns in the past, and husband quickly dismisses them by saying \u201cthey\u2019d never do that\u201d, even though OP was correct.\n\nThe fact that OP set such a hard boundary, and the husband still entertains the idea of going out to the party anyway makes me not trust him to stay home. In husband\u2019s mind, OP is too paranoid. I\u2019m worried that once OP leaves for her night out, he\u2019d just drop the kid at in-laws house because he trusts his parents to care for the child.", "And every time he does it behind OP\u2019s back & the baby doesn\u2019t die, he\u2019ll feel he was right all along & there was no danger\u2026 until the day the baby does drown.", "And if they can't arrange safe childcare, they can't go to the party. Their child needs to come first, it's a consequence of choosing to become a parent.", "However, she'd still need to be supervised closely near water until she's significantly older.", "We do have a baby sitter but she isn\u2019t available on this occasion and the plans my husband wants to go only were mentioned to him today (his friends always plan things with such short notice) otherwise my own mom would have driven over (she lives 2 hours away tho so her baby sitting is usually planned weeks in advance)", "NTA\u2026 but this sounds good hire a nanny to be there with your baby at the MIL house if she is not willing to come to your house", "True he never drowned but he also never had constant access to a canal which I think changes the situation. \n\nThe solution to no playing outside would absolutely be a great compromise if I felt I could trust then to stick to it. \n\nBut they\u2019ve previously been known to \u201comit\u201d details when they\u2019ve watched her to suit their agenda / if they think they know better so I don\u2019t trust them to actually not let her in the garden as they think I\u2019m being over cautious.\n\nExample; when she was a couple weeks old they offered to watch her at theirs so we could have a break for a couple hours and we found out afterwards they\u2019d taken her to an extended families house to meet aunts and uncles as they felt they needed to meet her before they went away on holiday. They knew we were waiting to introduce her to the extended family until she was a bit older and when we were there but they took that decision from us and just said \u201cthey\u2019d done something cheeky\u201d and laughed when they told us when we picked her up.", "They've already discussed a fence and FIL has said no to it.  \n\n>hey can be sitting down next to do water and not let her get even close to it or something like that.\n\nIt's called an accident, all it takes is 30 seconds for the grandparents to have a conversation with each other focused on themselves and the kid is in the water.  Neither one is quick by the sounds of it due to age, weight, and cancer. By the time they notice, get up and in the water the child could be dead or if not dead, disabled for the rest of its life.  Is it really a risk worth taking? \n\nOP isn't saying the kid can't go round ever, just not without one of the parents there.  If dad wants to go out grandma can babysit at theirs.  It's all very reasonable.", "It\u2019s not that they are 60, it\u2019s that they are two people with limited mobility due to medical issues who would be watching an active toddler near open, unsecured flowing water.", "It\u2019s not their age which is the problem but their overall health meaning they can\u2019t react quick to situations. \n\nWe have a baby sitter we usually use for date nights but she\u2019s not available on Saturdays and he only found out about his friends birthday plan today and it\u2019s in a week so no time to find a new one and introduce her to them etc.", "NTA, the death of a child is devastating to the family and also incredibly difficult on first responders.  Especially when they walk into a situation that was so easily preventable.  Honestly OP, I'd make this a hill to die on, either inlaws put up a fence or daughter does not go to their home unsupervised.", "Their petty feelings have no bearing on this decision. Drownings happen fast, and frequently where I live. Usually city kids whose parents don\u2019t understand the dangers. Nothing they can put you through will come close to having to choose a two foot long casket. Stand firm.", "I am aware that a person can drown in a just an inch or two of water, and also how quickly a tragedy can happen\n\nI was thinking of one of your parents  being able to enter  the canal, and stand.  But they each have health issues.\n\nI support your boundaries.  A canal in the backyard is not safe environment for a toddler.  \n\nYour husband is out of line thinking his parents can protect your child.  MIL needs to be at your house to babysit.", "Well, it seems like if you are going to put a rule in place that removes your babysitter, that would have been the time to source a new sitter.  You knew this was coming sooner or later. \n\nI think you need to either be the one to watch the child so he can go to his event or just hire a sitter without introducing your child to them first.", "It takes three hours to build a fence. If they want one, they can buy the materials and build it. Why make it so complicated? It's not a personal boundary they need to enforce, they need to get a hammer and some materials and built that boundary. Even a chicken fence made of a net and a few plastic poles would do if they really don't know how to use a hammer and want to have it removable.", "You\u2019re NTA. I\u2019m not sure where you are, but there is a grandmother on trial here in the states because two of her grandkids died in her care. One of the incidents was a toddler drowning in a near by pond. These accidents happen. \n\nMy concern is your husband leaving your child with his parents regardless of what you say. You need to make sure you are both on the same page before you leave. Do your research about accidental drownings and give all of the info to your husband. He needs to truly understand how unsafe that canal is without a fence there to help slow down a little one.", "All I'm saying is that it's not just up to OP. Her husband has a say as well.\n\nI'm saying she's an AH for making a one sided decision instead of making it a discussion with her husband (and her in laws afterwards).", "Just so you know, I'm not OP. \n\nI was agreeing with your initial comment but pointing out the depth of the water didn't really matter.", "Well they found and bought the house in like 3 weeks so this situation came upon us quicker than you\u2019d think. And my MIL said they\u2019d put a fence up, it was only when my FIL later dismissed the idea we found ourselves in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m away that day, and it\u2019s been planned ages in advance as my turn to have a \u201cday out\u201d as my husband has had a few of them with his friends in recent weeks. His friends plan only got mentioned to him today. And I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable introducing a total stranger to my daughter and leaving her with them, it wouldn\u2019t be fair on her to do that.", "So when the kid dies because the husband prioritised going out drinking over his kids safety she'll still be an AH for trying to safeguard her kid? \n\nSometimes when one parent is being shortsighted or selfish and endangering the child the other one has to make a unilateral decision to protect the child.", "I disagree. Husband is willing to put his child at risk just so he can attend a birthday party? Fuck that noise.  \n\nNTA", "Honestly, the safest thing to do may be one of you cancel your plans. If you go out first without this resolved, he may drop daughter off at his parents. Heck, even if his parents show up to your house how do you know they won\u2019t decide to take her back to theirs?\n\nYou need trust here and they are dismissive of your concerns about the canal as well of their response time to a potential accident.", "No use discussing further. All I'm saying is that communication is the way to go instead of putting hard boundaries. At least if OP is interested in keeping the marriage.\n\nThat just reminded me, if they were divorced for instance (assuming shared custody), OP wouldn't even have a say if the child's father left the child to his parent's house.\n\nSo again, all I'm saying is communication is key.", "Or husband trusts his parents and that they'll take good care of their granddaughter.\n\nBut of course reddit goes like \"the father cares more about partying than the safety of his own child\" smh", "First thought here too. Cancel if you can OP, or you\u2019ll come back to \u201csee, it was fine, nothing happened\u201d Until it does.", "I agree it may be the only way to truly safe guard this child, but it will be at the cost of a bigger issue. OP\u2019s husband won\u2019t forgo his plans to safe guard his child. He\u2019s willing to put his child at risk or just know his wife will always cave. He needs to be a better husband & father and say to his friend \u201csorry, that\u2019s just too short notice.\u201d", "Trusting the parents has nothing to do with it. Tragedy can happen in a split second. They refused to do the one thing that OP asked for, to make her child safe. I know someone who lost a child to drowning. They were a wonderful, involved parent. It only took a minute of distraction and their entire life was destroyed. I don\u2019t care if the husband trusts his parents. This is a hill I would die on.", "There's no point in us discussing this further then."]}
