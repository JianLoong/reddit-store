Obviously this is too much adulting for your mom and sis. \n\nPersonally I would go with Dad on the camping/fishing trip - you and your wife.

I told you again when we arrived. I told you for a third time when you left that morning. Wife told you for a fourth time herself. So it\u2019s confusing to me when you tell me that you didn\u2019t understand she was working. You\u2019re either lying to me or you\u2019re experiencing such an extreme memory loss or comprehension difficulties that a medical exam is warranted. Which is it? Help me understand here? Do you really not remember anyone telling you she was working? Is this a genuine misunderstanding in which you somehow don\u2019t recall four different conversations?\u201d\n\nFrom there, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m concerned that you don\u2019t remember. That\u2019s a clear indicator you aren\u2019t thinking clearly and can\u2019t be expected to approach this rationally right now. I\u2019m very worried about cognitive decline and expect you are too. Not remembering four distinct conversations is extreme and I understand why you\u2019re embarrassed and reacting strongly. Wife did not do anything wrong, however, as she did not know you were having lapses in memory. Let\u2019s not discuss this further until you\u2019ve seen a doctor and have been evaluated. Until then, I don\u2019t want to hear more about this. I think space is good, we\u2019ll be going camping with dad. I\u2019ll make allowances for your irrational behavior as long as you promise to get it checked out and get appropriate treatment so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nOr, \u201cSo there is nothing extremely wrong with your memory then? You\u2019re offended by me saying so? You do remember those conversations? There isn\u2019t a need to rush to the hospital? In that case, I\u2019m hurt that you lied to me and created such a big conflict. This has deeply impaired trust and I think we need some space. We\u2019ll be going camping with dad. Please let me know when you\u2019re ready to apologize for lying to me and for knowingly disrupting wife\u2019s work and livelihood.\u201d\n\nTake the same approach with other family. So, \u201cI clearly told mom wife was working before we arrived, when we arrived, and that morning. I know she\u2019s saying it\u2019s a misunderstanding. It\u2019s really confusing to me that she doesn\u2019t remember. I\u2019m worried that something is seriously wrong and would like her to see a doctor. I know she\u2019s telling you it was a miscommunication, but I was there and it was communicated so clearly and so many times that if she truly was confused then I\u2019m worried she is experiencing some sort of cognitive decline. Have you noticed other signs of memory loss? How has she seemed to you? Not understanding that someone is working despite being told is worrisome to me. I assume you share my concern. Will you keep an eye out for her this thanksgiving.
