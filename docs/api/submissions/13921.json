{"id": 13921, "submission_id": "12atmdj", "title": "AITA for throwing my cousin's divorce in his face?", "selftext": "I (31 f) am somewhat close with my cousin, 29(m). We will call him Brad. About a year and a half ago, his wife left him and they started coparenting both their kids (7 yo twins).  Brad took this really hard because in his mind, he did everything the \"right\" way. Got married, bought a home, provided financially while his wife was a SAHM, ect. His wife had a long-term affair and left him for the other man. It's been hard on him and we all have tried to be supportive. \n\nWell his sister, my other cousin (28f), just had her third baby. Now, I will admit she is probably not in the best position objectively to have a baby. Her and her husband are really financially unstable, they have to move a lot due to evictions and struggle to stay employed. However, shit happens and the baby is already here. My cousin told me herself that the pregnancy was not planned and she was taking birth control. Is it a great situation? No. But they decided to keep the baby and I think all parents deserve emotional support. \n\nLast weekend I planned a dinner for us all to get together to have dinner and celebrate the new baby (she's a few weeks old at this point). Well for some reason, Brad decided to make snide comments during dinner about the fact that my other cousin had another baby. At one point he said \"too many people have babies they can't afford\" while staring directly at his sister and at another point he said something about people without jobs should lose their children. I think it's relevant to add that Brad was going out of his way to make these comments- it didn't flow in the natural course of conversation at all. Eventually my other cousin excused herself and left, and I could tell she was really upset. \n\nAfter they left I followed Brad into the kitchen where we were alone and I said \"Was all that really necessary? You just embarrassed her in front of everyone.\" and he said \"She's irresponsible and she needs to know that. I don't care if it hurts her feelings it's true.\"  Then proceeded to go on a tangent about the \"right\" way to do things. This is where I kinda went off. I told Brad that clearly the \"right\" thing to do doesn't always work out, since he did just that and his wife still walked out and left. I told him that she was his sister and the baby was already here, and he needed to get off his high horse and have some damn empathy. He went OFF. He started screaming at me about how dare I bring up his ex wife, and my husband came in and told him he wasn't going to scream at me in my own house and he needed to either calm down or leave. Brad told us both to fuck off and left. \n\nMy family is mostly siding with me, saying that they were uncomfortable during dinner because of Brad's comments and that he has no room to tell other people what they should be doing. My aunt is siding with Brad though, saying I shouldn't have \"thrown the divorce in his face\".

Assuming your aunt is Brad's mom, AKA a Brad Apologist who enables him to stagnate in a place where he is such a bitter asshole that he can't pick a proper time or place to address his concerns about his sister's life choices and instead wants to do it openly and at a time meant to celebrate her.

Obviously he was being a huge asshole, but I don't see what relevance his divorce had to the fact he was making everyone uncomfortable with his comments and behavior. What if he was still married and acting that at the party? Just seemed like a low blow to hurt him because he was hurting his sister, but it's not a point that lands too well since its really unrelated. His wife probably left him because he's an asshole, not because the universe is unfair.", "NTA. What goes around comes around and it was time for him to hear it. Every baby is a blessing even if your situation is not ideal", "NTA. You made an excellent point. If he's going to make passive aggressive comments, he should not be surprised to get a reaction in return. The world doesn't always work in a logic way, and nobody owes him anything. If his sister is happy and can make it work out, even if he thinks it shouldn't, he has to deal with it.\n\nJust to add some salt to the wound.

Also no. Baby is here and the parents have enough to juggle without a bunch of critique about the fact baby exists. It might not be great, and it won\u2019t be easy, but they can make it work. \n\nBrad sounds like he\u2019s taking out his anger and frustration about his own divorce on someone he can make feel more inferior than he does right now.

Before the divorce he was great. Like a give you the shirt off his back kind of guy.  My husband actually convinced him to try therapy a few months after his wife left because he was down deep in depression, like we were monitoring him daily type of situation. I'm not sure if he is still going to therapy at this point. He's come out of his depression ever since the custody situation was resolved but he's just an asshole about anything having to do with marraige or kids. He's very bitter.", "Yeah, i respect what you're saying. I'm going to be honest though, it's hard not to talk about his divorce. Anytime marriage or kids is brought up he has to share some gross opinions like this. It is so painfully obvious he is resentful and bitter. And he has a right to be, but I do not think he has a right to take it out on others. \n\nAs fair as his points, I think they would be strong if my cousin was sitting there talking about actively trying to have a baby.

Another question: is it possible his sister has asked him or his parents for money?  I'm reaching for an explanation of why he might react in this way and maybe if she's asking him for support or asking the parents for support and then leaving the parents with less, this could be rubbing him the wrong way?  I'm reaching here, maybe there's nothing and he's just in a bad way post-divorce, but food for thought anyway.  Good luck to you all with it, I hope a better equilibrium is found for all of you.", "He is an AH and the divorce may permanently jade him. Hopefully with time the pain mellows out and he can heal.\n\nFor what counts, I wish your cousin well.

To answer your question, I know he did loan her about $150 right before she went into labor because she was short on her rent, but she did pay it back the next week. To my knowledge that\u2019s the only time he\u2019s given her money. I know she has stayed with my aunt (their mom) off and on in between housing situations but I have no clue if they\u2019ve given her money. I would guess probably? But my aunt has also favored Brad most of their lives, so I don\u2019t think anything she gives her is taking anything from Brad but I could be wrong. It could be playing a role, I\u2019m not sure.", "> but she did pay it back the next week.\n\nfair & square - they may struggle but they sound good for it, frankly after reading so many stories here I'm surprised (good for them)\n\nyour brother is deeply wounded, she had that other man the whole time??? yikes\n\nI think he is jealous of his sister to be honest."]}
