She was shocked to hear me say that and started crying saying she did her best with what she had. \n\nMy brothers surprisingly stood up for her and told me that If she that bad then why am I still living with her and that she was amazing caretaker and took us when our own mother abandoned us so how could I be so selfish and accused her of any less.\n\nIt got really contentious so my sister ended up excusing herself to her room but in the end my brother whom I'm really close too are angry with me. \n\nSo now I'm here wondering if I was wrong for  calling my sister out.", "created_utc": 1673388558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108mmfn/aita_for_calling_my_sister_for_treating_her_child/", "score": 7125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dropped her **whole life** at *19* to take care of **THREE** kids? \n\nI understand being upset at having a less than perfect childhood, but childhood doesn't magically stop at 18. \n\nShe was *still a kid* when she was taking care of you three. No shit she was stressed and having major difficulty! \n\nAnd now you're looking at her, finally able to be an adult without the frantic panic and you *resent* her for *now having the support* to take care of her children the way she wants too? \n\nOP, respectfully- you suck.", "YTA. Let's recap: at 19, your sister took sole custodianship of her 3 siblings, a task that very few 19 year-olds would even be capable of, let alone willing to do. From your description, she basically killed herself making sure you all got by and apparently did well enough that you are all still around and that she was able to finally start focusing on herself and starting her own family after giving up all of her 20s for you. And you're calling her out for not being perfect at a huge responsibility that she never should have had to take on in the first place?\n\nI hope this is fake because I'm absolutely disgusted by it.\n\nThe only excuse here is that you're still too young to fully understand the weight of this kind of responsibility. But think about it this way, in 2 years, would you be ready to fully care for 3 young children and provide for them while not being stressed out? If not, then go apologize.", "YTA. \n\nYour sister was barely grown herself when she took in 3 children that were not hers. \n\nOf course she was stressed and irritable. Parenting is hard at the best of times but parenting when you're so young yourself in such a complicated situation is next level. \n\nShe constantly provided for you all. She never let any of you down, despite being put in a situation that she should not have had to be in. \n\nNow she is an adult. She has had time to learn, and mature and that is her child. \n\nYou just sound ungrateful, honestly. Was she perfect? No. But it sounds a lot like she did her very best in a diabolical situation.", "Man the experience you went through sucked. But you blaming your sister for not being able to be a proper parent at 19 when she was not prepared to handle three children is a bit entitled.\n\nYou did deserve a happy family environment. You got what she was capable of giving. You're 17. Imagine doing what she had to do right now. Three children, and sacrificing her relationship and youth to make sure you weren't indigent. Be a bit more gracious to her. It's okay to talk about how it sucked, and you're not wrong for having issues or trauma as a result of that, but putting it on your sister is unfair.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  I'm not necessarily excusing her reactions when you were kids, but she was barely an adult herself and sounds like she did everything she could to provide for you materially. She very well may have been/still be resentful, but it seems like she tried to put that aside to take care of her siblings. \n\nYou don't say which sibling you are, but it's been at least 11 years - she's allowed to grow as a person and parent.  I'm not sure what you expected by giving her a hard time. She can't undo how she acted/reacted to you and your siblings, and if you think she was unfair to you, then it's cruel to expect her to treat her children the same way", "Are you for real?", "Listen, I understand where you are coming from, and it's very difficult when you feel like your caretaker resents you.  However, a few key things I saw:\n\n>My sister at one point in time was working 3 jobs to even be able to   \nprovide for us, I never went without food or clothes or even toys.\n\nDo you have ANY idea how stressful it is to work 3 jobs?  On top of that, taking care of 3 children you didn't plan for?\n\n>My sister is now doing much better in life and no longer have to work and is happily married, she has a 2 year old and is pregnant with her 2nd, I seen how she treats  \n them and I can tell she loves them very much, I even watched her   \ntoddler spilled a glass a milk and she was so clam and loving about it,   \nshe even jumped on this new gentle parenting trend.\n\nYou said it yourself, she is doing much better in life.  The entire situation has changed, and she now is caring for children she planned for, and has had more time to learn just how to raise a child.  \n\nYou had a difficult upbringing, and she had a difficult time making sure you were well taken care of.  I don't blame you for being upset at the change in parenting.  Just remember, she didn't go into it saying \"I want to raise 3 young children as a young adult myself\", she went in thinking \"I will NOT let my brothers and sisters be separated, and will do everything in my power to care for them as best I can.\"\n\nYTA, give her some slack.  She was in a very difficult situation, and tried her best to be the best guardian she could with little to no experience.", "YTA.  Your sister is a saint.  And you are absolutely TA.", "YTA\n\nShe was a 19yo caring for three children that she did not choose to have. Of course she was stressed and had less emotional capacity than she does now as an adult who has chosen to have children. And of course she was more stressed about things like spilled milk - she probably was struggling hard to afford that milk.\n\nExpecting anyone to have the same emotional maturity and parenting capacity at 19 vs 32 just reflects your own immaturity and relative lack of experience as an adult.\n\nNo it's not fair that you didn't get your sister and a caring, gentle, patient parent. But the entire situation was horribly unfair to ALL of you. It's unfair to your sister that she had to care for 3 small children when she was barely beginning to be an adult. You are not the only person with feelings in this situation.", "YTA 100% \n\nYour sister wrecked her life purely to support her family and worked THREE JOBS so that you wouldn't want for anything \n\nA 19 year old doing the job of two parents for people who she CHOSE to take in is obviously not going to be perfect. And you're still living with her! \n\nIf your sister suddenly died and you had to take in her children, would you be ecstatic about it at all times?", "YTA- I get that it's hard to live in a household where you are clearly resented, but then she had every right to be resentful. Although you had no choice in the matter, she was sacrificing a lot to provide for you. The thing is now that she doesn't have that stress, she can relax and be nurturing instead of feeling crushed all day everyday.", "I'm sorry for your childhood troubles, but YTA here.  You are holding a 19 year old to a full grown adults standards.  It sounds like she did the absolute best she could at the time, and being only 19, she probably still had a lot of growing up to do.  It's unfair for you to hold this against her.", "For calling her out, yes YTA. \n\nYou aren\u2019t an AH for being hurt that you never got to grow up in a loving environment. That is a legitimate and painful loss to live with. \n\nThese two things can simultaneously be true - you deserved better as a child but also that your sister isn\u2019t an AH for not being able to provide that.", "YTA\n\nHere are some of the things you wrote in your post. \n\n>My sister taken my brothers and I in when we were just ( 4f 5m 6m) and she was only 19 at the time and did sacrifice alot for us\n\n>My sister at one point in time was working 3 jobs to even be able to provide for us, I never went without food or clothes or even toys.\n\n>my sister was always stressed and irritable,\n\n>My sister is now doing much better in life and no longer have to work and is happily married,\n\nYour sister was still a teen when she took in 3 young children. She made a lot of sacrifices to ensure you had everything you needed. That's a lot of pressure for someone so young. She did her best. \n\nThere is going to be a noticeable difference in how she treats her kid now. She's with a stable partner, is older with more child rearing experience, and no longer has to work multiple jobs just to make sure there's food on the table. \n\nAbsolutely none of this means she didn't love you. She still loves you. What more do you want from her?", "YTA of course. Not because you can't talk about your hardships growing up, but for how you said it and what you said. Ofcourse it's easier for her to be a stable and loving guardian when she has emotional and financial security + several years of growth. Be mindful that she did a lot to give you the best childhood she was able to.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you're so spoiled to have the nerve to write this, is a testament to how good she has been to you. You have absolutely no right to ever complain about anything from her.", "YTA you're brothers are right and your sister did her absolute best in a ridiculously difficult situation. I'm not going to lay on all the reasons because so many people already are doing that in response. \n\nI just suggest you sit down with your brothers and find out why they are upset with you. LISTEN to them, don't interject actually hear what they have to say, because I think it's important for you to hear and truly understand what she did for you and how difficult it must have been for her at that age and at the expense of her own life and future. \n\nThen apologies to her.", "YTA\nYour sister was 19 barely an adult and not that mature and doing the best she could taking care of three kids instead of living it up and being a young adult. She was a single parent, no coparent and working three jobs. There is no surprise she she was probably short with you. And it was NOT your fault that she behaved as she did, but I can\u2019t even imagine myself in her place doing all of that. \nShe\u2019s older, more mature and has a partner so she doesn\u2019t have to work.  \nIf you feel this hurt by everything you need a therapist. I don\u2019t want to invalidate your feelings those are real. It was a hard situation. But clearly this is something you need to work through privately and not yelling at her in front of everyone. \n\nYou should apologize to her and talk through your feelings. It wasn\u2019t fair to her at all.", "YTA. Why don't you try adopting 3 young kids in a couple of years when you're 19 and see how good you are at it?", "YTA. \n\nImagine yourself today on taking on 3 children. She was young and not a parent.  You are lucky you didn't wind up in foster care. You owe her a major apology.", "YTA.  Your sister was a child, only 2 years older than you are now, who took on THREE children.  She had to work, and juggle childrearing, and was not in an emotional or mental state to take all that responsibility on, yet she did.  She is the reason you and your siblings remained together in one home.  She is older and more mature and has learned.  News flash, every parent makes mistakes.  Virtually no 19-year-old would put their future on hold and sacrifice to raise 3 young children that their mother(so she clearly had a poor role model)abandoned.\n\nYou owe your sister one hell of an apology.  If you have anger regarding your childhood, direct it at your mother.  She is the failure, your sister was the hero.", "YTA.  \nSure, she might not have been the greatest for you, but she did everything in her power to keep her siblings together. What you could have had was much, much worse. She has grown, she has had new experiences, you cannot shit on your sister for being a good mother.  \n\n\nWhen she took you and your brothers in, she was not your mother, and she didn't know how to be. All she knew was that she had to take care of you. And taking care of 3 kids at 19? That's INSANE. Give her a break, she did her best!", "YTA. I was in the exact situation your sister was in with 3 siblings when I was 18. Dropped out and worked 3 shitty jobs. She did the best she could with what she had. Your brother is right. Move out.", "YTA.  Your sister made huge sacrifices at a very young to take care of you and your siblings. If she was working 3 jobs in order to support 3 children on her own, she was probably physically and emotionally exhausted, which is why she had much less patience for you than she does with her own child, with whom she is raising with the help of a partner and at a much more mature age.", "YTA\n\nI am so sorry for everything you and your siblings dealt with. But 1000% YTA.\n\nBUT WAIT... You had the audacity to call her out while STILL living with her? Your YTA rating just went up to 20000% YTA\n\nComparing how a 19year old (who had to work 3 jobs and who was most likely not ready to care for 1 let alone 3 children) to how a grown adult is when it comes to caregiving is insane.\n\nYou completely disregarded the sacrifices she had to make to keep your family together AND belittled what she went through while raising you AND 2 other young siblings when she was barely an adult.\n\nYour brothers are completely right to be angry with you. I hope you plan on going above & beyond to apologize to your sister and show your appreciation. If not, I hope you don't plan to CONTINUE to live under her roof because if I were her spouse, you would be out of my house before you finished writing your post.\n\nThe last thing I will say is you're not AH for feeling what you feel. I am sure it is hard to witness this gentleness and patience when you weren't afforded it. Your anger about that is valid, but it isn't your sister's fault. \n\nWould you honestly prefer her to be the same now as she was back then? People grow and learn to process things better and face challenges without letting their emotions go haywire.\n\nImagine if you had to take in 3 children because you are essentially the same age as when she took you in. Seriously ask yourself if you could manage if ON YOUR OWN without any support while working non-stop to provide. \n\n*\\[edited because my web's writing extension messed up the paragraphs\\]*", "YTA. Your 19yo sister took you and your siblings in, working 3 jobs to provide so you didn't materially go without. \n\nAnd far as your comments she was always stressed and irritable, well d'uh, of course she was, she was working 3 jobs whilst raising 3 children. \n\nAnd all this was when she was barely an adult herself. Your sister took you in when mother abandoned you, all **four** of you. Just because she was 19 doesn't mean that your sister didn't need a loving parent too, and it doesn't mean she was emotionally mature enough to be the parent you feel she should have been to you. Do you know what age, on average, women tend to become emotionally mature? 32. That's right about the age she is now.", "Big YTA. Umm, she's not your mother and took on a huge responsibility, one that she didn't have to. Contrary to what you may believe, she actually doesn't owe you anything. Count yourself lucky you had family to provide for you. Try being grateful you didn't end up in foster care.", "YTA Your sister worked three jobs to support you and your two siblings when she was only 19, gave up her childhood sweetheart to be your parent, keeping you out of the foster care system, put her dreams in hold, and made sure you had everything you needed, and now you are almost literally crying over spilt milk? \n\nI can\u2019t believe how ungrateful you are. It sounds like you are jealous of her toddler instead of applauding how your sister has finally gotten in a good place in life, is taking great care her kids, and is continuing to let you live in her comfortable home. You owe her an apology. Do better and honor her sacrifices by giving her your love, appreciation and help around the house.", "idk if I can call you an AH. You're hurt and you've been through a lot in life but so has your sister. Might be good to talk to her and have an open talk and open heart and try to understand each other better. Wish you luck with your family and I hope your pain eases", "NAH, actually. I think you did need to express to your sister how you felt. But you should probably discuss it with her. She deserves a lot of leeway because of how old she was. But you\u2019re allowed to be upset and express that, you deserved gentleness too.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. This situation 100% sucks for everyone involved. She did the best she could. You say you never went without and unfortunately all the work she put in left her with nothing to give you guys emotionally. You were just a child. So was she essentially. With that being said, if you didn\u2019t grow up in a home with empathy, it\u2019s understandable that you may not  have much for her now. It\u2019s okay to be upset and voice your pain. Maybe the setting wasn\u2019t right and hopefully you guys can have a conversation later on about you understanding it was hard for her but that you so wish you could have had the gentle side of her. Acknowledge that she worked hard for you and you appreciate it. Hoping for healing for your family.", "I'm sorry that your mother (and father?) abandoned you, and I want to say it's OK to grieve (for a while) for the parents and affection you didn't have, but please do recognise that your sister did her best. \n\nTaking in three young children at 19 - not much older than you are now - is a very big deal, and she gave up a lot to provide for you and keep the family safe and together. If that isn't love, I don't know what is. \n\nNow she's in her 30s, with an established life and a partner to share responsibilities - that's a very different proposition. I understand your pain and sense of loss, I really do, but you owe her an apology. Gentle YTA.", "INFO: What are your plans for next year when you turn 18? Because (as your sister) she didn\u2019t have to take you in when you were 4 and she *certainly* doesn\u2019t have to keep taking care of you once you turn 18 since she is your sister, not your mother. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t wish to stay with her cold and unloving self any longer, so what\u2019s the plan?", "Your sister was 19 when she took in 3 minor children, you are 17 now, so what do you think that looks like? You are only 2 years younger than she was when she got custody of all of you, what do you think your life would look like if you took in 3 kids right now?\n\nYou've been through a lot, and I'm sure your sister wasn't the dream parent, but you are old enough to appreciate what happened to her too, and all that she did to make sure you grew up safe and healthy. She was barely an adult, worked 3 jobs, and sacrificed a lot. \n\nShe is now older, financially stable, and is married. She has a partner and financial security, which means she is less stressed about money, about how to support her children, and has a partner to lean on. You are old enough to imagine what your life would be like at your age with 3 minor children, versus what your life would look like at 30  and deciding to have children, have a partner, and have enough money to do it. \n\nI get that you had a lot to go through on your own, and in a situation like yours, I want to give a soft YTA. But, I have to say, you are 17, and old enough to be able to understand why your sister is a different parent now than 12 years ago, and so it's a full YTA.", "YTA. Your sister was a child raising three children and working three jobs. Yet you *never* went without. My friend, life dealt you all a \\[poopy\\] hand. Your sister appears to have handled everything with as much love and grace as her 19\u2013year\u2013old self could muster. You know what that is? It's love in action. \n\nYou should be thankful your sister didn't leave you and your siblings to be wards of the state.", "Yes. She was exhausted, given way too much responsibility than she could handle as you weren\u2019t even her kids, and she lost her love, her freedom, her youth and her future for you. \n\nYTA.\n\nYou wait until (if) you have kids. You wait until (if) you have kids as a single parent. You wait until (if) you have kids and have to juggle work, house and childcare, maybe as a single parent. You see how calm and reasonable you are then.", "Honestly- it\u2019s very unfair to both of you. It is not her fault though. She kept you guys together, connected as a family rather than a foster home. She did the best she could, based on the age and circumstances. I do understand how it upsets you to see what you missed out on when you were younger, which is something you may have to work through personally. Be happy that she is in a place that she can love and parent comfortably with significantly less stress. You\u2019re mother is the reason you were deprived of a childhood, not your sister.", "YTA. You owe your sister a heartfelt apology. If you don't understand why now, trust me, you will understand why when you are older. What your sister has been able to do is heroic.\n\nHowever: I do understand your feelings of abandonment, loss, and lack of nurturing. I really hope that you will seek therapy, and can come to a place of peace and love for yourself and for your sister.", "She was TWO years older than you are right now and took on caring for you all \u2014 no matter what it cost her. Meanwhile here you are and can\u2019t get over yourself enough to not be jealous of a 2 year old.\n\nI\u2019m sure she did the best she could have. And it probably helps that she has a partner and has evolved as a person.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Of course your sister is a better parent now. She's an adult and has the support of a spouse. She was just a kid when she started raising you.", "You absolutely have a right to be angry that you didn\u2019t get a loving nurturing home environment, but you are mad at the wrong person. Your sister stayed and took you in and did her best to provide what she could. It wasn\u2019t enough, but it also wasn\u2019t her job. It was your parents job. They are the ones that created the terrible situation and they are the ones that deserve your anger. It\u2019s easier to be mad at the people who are nearby. \n\nIt makes sense that you are jealous of your sister\u2019s kid. They have a loving stable home, which you lacked. But again that is on your parents and not your sister. Working 3 jobs as a 19 year old taking care of 3 kids who have undergone trauma (and likely traumatized herself) is very, very different than her current situation. She was basically your age and had probably also never had a loving, stable childhood. \n\nPlease consider apologizing and asking for what you actually need, which is therapy to help you cope with your trauma. All of you probably would benefit from therapy. There was plenty of trauma to go around. Soft YTA.", "She was a kid raising MULTIPLE kids. I couldn't imagine, tbh. I'm sorry that the situation wasn't idea, but YTA. She did a lot better than I could have from the sound of it. If you never wanted for anything, this experience was 100% harder for your sister", "YTA how would you cope if you suddenly had to care for her kids all alone with no other support next year. Put yourself in her shoes. She was an unprepared teen taking care of you as opposed to the adult she is now", "I'd have to say YTA. Your sister made huge sacrifices and uprooted her life for you and you seem ungrateful. Your brother makes a good point- if she was really unloving why are you still living with her? Not trying to excuse her being harsh and cold, but of *course* she's different as an adult in her 30s compared to being an actual teenager. I understand you feel hard done by, but I think the blame here lies on your mother, not your sister. You're blaming the wrong person. Go lecture your mother for your upbringing instead.", "You're not wrong that it's not fair she was a harsh and irritated parent to you. But it's also not fair that she worked 3 jobs and took in 3 very young kids at 19.  \n\nIt's fine and normal to feel upset about what you didn't get out of your childhood. But it's worth considering how much has changed in the ~15 years since then. How much she's learned & grown as a person, and how much less stress she has. Her less than ideal treatment of you was probably the best she could manage at the time. I don't want to label you an AH for not fully recognizing that, though.", "YTA Sister sacrificed everything at the time to provide for you, no wonder she didn't have the bandwidth to provide the emotional environment you would need. That's not her fault.", "I think you might just need some therapy to talk about your problems", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NAH, and here\u2019s why:\n\nYou and all your siblings went through a trauma. Your trauma was being separated from your parents, missing out on the nurturing, loving home every child deserves. Obviously your bio parents couldn\u2019t give that to you, (speaking as someone who was a foster parent) our foster system is so entirely fucked that it was very unlikely the three of you would have been placed in a loving, nurturing, foster/adopt home together. Hell, even being individually placed might not have given you and your siblings that - even with all safeguards in place, abuse in foster homes is rampant. You are (rightfully) pining for something you SHOULD have had, as all children SHOULD have, if we lived in a fair world. You then see your sister giving to her children what you SHOULD have had, and it\u2019s understandable that fills you with rage. It\u2019s not fair that you didn\u2019t get what she is only now able to give. \n\nAt 17, it\u2019s hard to imagine yourself in two years taking on what your sister did - three young children entirely dependent on you, working three jobs, giving up dreams and relationships. Working three jobs alone is exhausting, let alone coming home and taking care of three little ones after, let alone when you are still at an age where your frontal lobe (the thing in your brain that helps control emotions and judgements) won\u2019t fully develop for another five years. Your sister was exhausted, trying to keep it all together, and physiologically not at a point where rational thoughts and emotions were fully developed. Imagine the most exhausting day you\u2019ve ever had, where you slog through the day just dreaming about getting in bed, where you struggle to keep your eyes open, where everything in your body hurts, and coming in to a spilled glass of milk when all you want is to escape. That was likely your sisters every day. Was it fair that she couldn\u2019t keep her emotions in check? No, but I say that it wasn\u2019t fair to you OR her. \n\nNow, your sister is fully developed brain wise. She has a partner who (hopefully) takes on parenting duties as well, someone who she can lean on to be able take over when she needs to escape and rest. She doesn\u2019t work three jobs so she has more energy, and is able to think rationally when the unexpected (spilled glass of milk) happens. She is not consistently exhausted, and is able to actually think through her emotions and actions.\n\nI think you do owe your sister and apology, but I\u2019m going to stick with my judgement, because I agree it wasn\u2019t fair to you (but it also wasn\u2019t fair to her). I think it would be worth going to therapy to work though this, both solo and with your sister.", "soft YTA i think,\n\nyour sister was under an INCREDIBLE amount of pressure . raising three kids would already be hell but at age 19 ? she sacrificed a lot for you guys . its clear shes doing a lot better as a parent now that shes in a better headspace .\n\non the other hand , i do know how awful it feels to have someone yelling at you for every tiny mistake you made . you do have every right to be upset about that , but i think there wouldve been a much better way that you could bring it up without being ungrateful about everything she did for you . this isnt an 'i gave birth to you so worship the ground i walk on situation ' , she took you in as someone who was barely an adult .", "Very soft YTA. You said your sister was 19 and working 3 jobs when she took 3 of you in after petitioning for custody. She obviously was struggling at the time, barely being out of school herself and taking care of 3 very small kids while she was still adjusting to \"adulthood\" and didn't have any guidance. Your brothers are right, she did do the best she could with the resources she had. I imagine in the last 13 years you've been under her care that things have improved, I hope. It definitely is going to hurt that she wasn't kinder and more gentle with you, but you also have to remember she was only 2 years older than you are now. Meaning she's likely 31 or 32 now, correct? Give her some grace, please. I also feel like calling her out in front of other members of the family was extremely unnecessary, and sitting her down to discuss it in private would have been better.", "Wow. At 17 hearing some many say YTA will be harsh. It may be time for some therapy to unpack your feelings and hopefully your sister will join you. You need to take some time and space to gain perspective. Your feelings are valid regarding not feeling nurtured when you were young. That is what the therapy is for. The perspective is writing down the facts of what occurred. A 19-year old starting a life that did not get a chance to begin for her dreams. She CHOSE to care for her siblings who lost any parental support, she lost that support, she lost a long-term relationship because of her dedication to her siblings (You) and ensured you all never went without anything. She worked 3 jobs. I challenge you to go get two jobs while going to school and make sure to fit in babysitting (solo) your two-year old nephew for at least three months. Cut the woman a break and begin work that many of us adults have by nurturing yourself. If you take the challenge then you will find there will not be much time for that either. \n\nSo yes, your sister was possibly short-tempered, possibly resentful at times, and lacked patience. I am 54 and guarantee you if I was doing what she did I would be the same way. It does not take the love and dedication away from you. She showed you mad love, just not in a way you expect. That is the problem though, it is an expectation YOU are placing on someone who did their best with what they had. Placing emotional expectations only creates pain emotionally for you.", "YTA \n\nYour sister who was barely an adult, took 3 little kids in, cared for you, worked her goddamn ass of so you had food and everything and you are angry with her because she is kinda happy now?\n\nI'm sorry that she wasn't that loving to you, I really am but she did something that most people aren't capable of and most children don't have. She fucking deserves some happiness now. I hope you can find that too.", "I see where you are coming from, but YTA. She didn't have to take care of ya'll. She was still a child too, and based on your post she gave up a lot to care for you and really did the best she could. Maybe you felt lonely because your brothers had each other and you just wanted her to be more invested with you cause you're both girls?", "I\u2019m going to say NAH\n\nShe was in a very tough situation having to care for 3 kids at 19 all alone. She was stressed. But she did not handle her stress well, and yelled at children over spilled milk. Walking on eggshells as a child because your caretaker is not coping well is a traumatic way to grow up. You\u2019re still a minor, so now you see her acting all sweet and gentle with her \u201creal kids\u201d and that is hard to see. \n\nYou need therapy. And she needs therapy. And some family sessions with your brothers would be beneficial too.", "Im going with NAH. The Y T A comments are so harsh. OP is 17, op was just 4 years old living in a stressful situation and missed out on a lot on their childhood. The sister is absolutely  goat taking all their siblings in at such a young age but OP getting a little jealous seeing their mother figure (they were 4!!! When their sister took them in) treat her children better can definitely be jarring and bring up a lot of trauma.\n\nOP, reflect on your life and everything your sister did and has done for you, find a good therapist and try to resolve all of the trauma you\u2019ve been through in your life. Bond with your nieces/ nephews and try to be happy with where your family is now.", "NAH. She did the best she could. You were hurt by her actions. Both things can be true.", "YTA, she paused her life sacrificed a lot for you siblings. She probably wasn't even prepared to be a mother let alone 3. She did the best she could with what she was capable of.\n\nOver time she has grown as a person and like you said in a better place. I can't imagine working 3 jobs looking after 3 young ones and being completely mellow.\n\nYou should be extra grateful and appreciative of what she's done for you, she's 1 in a million even with her faults, who else was willing to take you in?", "YTA - she was still a kid herself when she took on the responsibility to look after you and your brothers. You should be proud of her and how she is trying to do better now with her children", "YTA.  She gave up her young adulthood to provide you a stable home, food, and toys.  Yes, she was irritable; yes, she was impatient.  She was a kid herself and it wasn't her responsibility to raise you guys.  If she didn't love you, she wouldn't.  She was running herself ragged and she didn't have the ability or bandwidth to be patient.  Now that she has support, now that she's not working 3 jobs trying to keep 3 kids alive - she has the luxury of being patient and creating a nurturing environment.  You can't compare her as a girl of 19 with the world on her shoulders to the woman of 32 she is today.", "Your sister\u2019s parenting doesn\u2019t sound ideal, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. She was barely an adult and had three children to look after. You should be grateful YTA", "OP you are feeling like this is because your sister is likely the only stable parent you knew. She is a better mum to her daughter then she was to you. Its ok to feel that.\n\nBut your sister wasn't thinking this. You weren't her kid but her sibling. Its a different type of love.\n\nMy sister and I have a 9 year difference. I have changed that girl's diapers and taken care of her extensively. I can easily die for her. That said we fight, we argue, I resented her a lot of times when I was young and so on. We were passengers on the same boat and sometimes the journey was rough.\n\nMy feeling for my kid is different. Its a different dynamic. I will kill for my child. I'm the boat. Its my job to protect hi from the world. We are not responsible for each other-Only I am responsible.\n\nYour sister probably feels the same way. You were all in a shitty situation together and working like a family. She sees you like a sibling. She relied on you as much as you relied on her. And this may have come in negative ways such as her snapping at you when she was stressed. You were in it together.\n\nShe can't rely on her kid. She is calmer because she has to regulate herself. Her kid isn't her equal however you were and are.\n\nI think you both love each other very much but in very different roles and this is causing a conflict. I think you should go to therapy  and unknot what you are feeling. NAH", "NAH. I cannot hold against your sister what she did when she was clearly under heavy strain, even though some would call it verbal abuse. But it seems like she was doing the best she could with a bad hand.  And I cannot really fault you for feeling jealous at seeing your niece getting what you always wanted.  Maybe you could have kept from saying anything, but sometimes things like this come out when it gets to be just too much. My advice would be to sit down with your sister and share all the reasons you are grateful to her, all the good things she has done, and apologize for making her feel so bad. You don\u2019t have to pretend those other feelings are not there or true for you, but try to focus on the better things. If nothing else, by taking you in, she prevented the three of you from being split up, which is very common.  I am sure you can think of other positives.", "YTA - your sister is a living saint and you\u2019re an insufferable fool who doesn\u2019t realize how delusional you sound.  I hope she kicks you out as you don\u2019t deserve her continued kindness", "A very soft YTA. \n\nYou are right. It sucks not feeling nurtured in a way you thought you should have as a kid. You're 17 or 18. How mature and capable do you think you could handle 3 kids barely school-aged?  With no or too little support.\n\nYes, she was harsh and should have done better. All new parents messed things up, but this was a sister. She loved you enough not to put you into foster. It would have been worse for you there. OR do you think that would have been better? \n\nCut her some slack. she learned a great deal with you and your siblings. Now learn from her on what not to do and what she is doing now.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through that, I\u2019ve witnessed a similar situation. It\u2019s a lot to take on at 19, your sister could of easily put you guys in foster care, but she didn\u2019t. \n\nShe chose to take on that responsibility and the role of the mother at a young age without any experience, guidance or help.\n\nShe worked 3 jobs to provide for you to make sure you never went without, while she missed out on college and important milestones. \nSo you can imagine why she was short tempered with you, it\u2019s a lot and not easy looking after 3 young kids that you had no intention of looking after. \n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from with wanting to be nurtured and loved, but for the sake of your mental wellbeing please seek out therapy. You need someone to vent to, your sister isn\u2019t that person anymore, and you need to talk to a professional.", "YTA\n\nShe took on the responsibility of raising children when she was barely even an adult herself. \nInstead of being grateful for all she's done with the very little tools she had you bash her.", "Wow! YTA! What an ungrateful sister you are.\nYou should realize how your sister work hard for you and your brother. \nAnd honestly, it's not her responsibility, she can easily choose the easy way out, to leave you. But she chose the hard way, took care of you.", "YTA - She was young and working 3 jobs to support herself and 3 siblings. She had to have been STRESSED beyond belief. Be thankful that you will never have to deal with or handle the stress that she had to at such a young age. I mean what was a little spilled milk to you was an extra hour she may have had to work to rebuy that said milk. She has now had more than a decade to grow as a person and caregiver, so I'm sure she is more patient. Also she is a lot less stressed with less responsibility and is now in a better place financially, so she has a lot less to worry about. She did something that a lot of people wouldn't do for their siblings, but instead of being grateful you basically went and spit in her face. I think you should apologize.", "YTA and a brat, of course she can handle\nHerself better now as an adult with a child she chose to make instead of as a teenager with three children that shouldn\u2019t have been her responsibility.", "YTA for talking to such a HORRIBLE person who mistreated you so much by...taking care of you and your siblings when no one else stepped up to do what's right  by you. /s", "Your sister.was 19 when she took you in. What would your life be like if you had 3 young children dropped on you now? Do you think you might be stressed? Worried about money? Apologize to your sister.

She gave up everything - her partner, education prospects, etc - to support her siblings, working a horrific amount to keep you happy and provided for... and youre sulking because you dont think the environment was supportive enough and she got mad when you broke stuff\n\nShe was under a horrific amount of stress for someone her age. Does that mean your feelings arent valid? Of course not. Id suggest working through it all with a therapist, and I hope your sister can get the same. But to publicly tear into her for zero reason other than youre mad she now lives in a far less stressful, supportive environment, and so can create a better environment for her kids? That wasnt fair.", "YTA. When your sister was not much older than you she became a parent to 3 children she never planned on. How would you handle it? Would you be a bit cross and stressed or would you be totally relaxed and fine?\n\nWhile you probably didn\u2019t have a great childhood, you really can not resent your sister who, before being able to drink in certain countries, took on her mother\u2019s/father\u2019s responsibilities and did her very best.", "YTA. 19 year olds are generally not prepared to be the sole, full time parent, of three young children. That\u2019s why she may not have had the emotional tools to do everything perfectly. She worked three jobs, lost her relationship, her entire life plan was derailed. Surely you can understand how that makes it hard to be emotionally strong and at your best. \n\nYour childhood could have been better. But obviously her 20\u2019s could have too. She took lemons and tried to make lemonade. You are coming across as ungrateful honestly.", "YTA, big time.  Do you realize that you stole the best years of your sister\u2019s life?  Back off you entitled brat.", "YTA. Can you imagine being 19 years old, never living out your 20s as the average person does, giving up all your dreams, working three whole jobs to take care of three little kids? She put her entire life on hold for you and your siblings when she did not have to and you\u2019re still ungrateful. Would you have rather been thrown in foster care, possibly being abused and never seeing your siblings again?

You\u2019re a brat.", "A lot of comments are calling you out OP and like don\u2019t think they\u2019re not justified, I can be a little more sympathetic to how you\u2019re feeling. My mother had me when she was 19, and then had the rest of my siblings after I had turned 11. I noticed that the way she parented me was much different than the way she parented my siblings, and I began to resent her for that. She was a lot harder on me, and that definitely continues to have an impact on our relationship. It took time for me to realize that she was a different person when she raised me, compared to now as she\u2019s raising my siblings. People change a lot, especially as they grow and mature from their teens into their twenties and thirties. As you are only 17 right now, you probably don\u2019t understand this personally, but give it some time and revisit this in 10 years or so. I think your perspective will change immensely. You cannot hold your sisters age against her; it\u2019s not a fair comparison because things were different and she was different. I understand that is frustrating and is not fair to you to have been on the receiving end of this all, but it\u2019s also not fair to hold that against your sister. Soft YTA", "YTA\u2026she was a child herself and sacrificed a lot to raise and ungrateful brat. She could\u2019ve let you go into the system but didn\u2019t and now that she\u2019s grown, matured and a loving mother, you feel she owes you something when in actuality, you owe her more than just a thank you and criticism.", "YTA- And I say this gently, because I know what it\u2019s like to see someone treat another person better than they treated you. But it had to be a LOT for a teenager to take in 3 small kids. She did that out of love. She does love you! You\u2019re not an AH for feeling cheated out of the best side of your sister. You\u2019re an AH for how you called her out in front of everyone, instead of having a private talk, using gentler words. She\u2019s all grown now, and has an easier life than she did when you were small. Of course she can offer her best side. She isn\u2019t struggling or under non stop stress.", "Yta she had a lot of responsibility at such a young age and she did her best to provide for you and your siblings. If she had 3 jobs she was probably exhausted and tired and stressed managing her jobs and taking care of you guys. You should be more kind to her and thankful.", "YTA. So your young 19 year old sister suddenly came a parent of three; had to work three jobs, lost her boyfriend because she stood by you three. Your mad that with a partner and no over worked and much more experienced in parenting; she\u2019s a better parent.\n\nHonestly ask older siblings; many will tell you about how unfair they had it in comparison to younger siblings; less strict etc; because parents learned from their mistakes", "YTA. You deserved a better childhood but so did your sister. She was a teenager when she had to deal with the loss of your parents and looking after 3 little kids. She did her best and you need to acknowledge that.", "YTA. She was barely older than a child herself looking after you. The bond she feels with her own is different.

Learn some empathy.", "YTA and it\u2019s astonishing that you need to be told this.", "Yta! Her life was turned upside down when she had to take you guys in.

Your words were not. And if you have that open and honest conversation with her, I hope she listens and hears you.

She was shocked to hear me say that and started crying saying she did her best with what she had. \n\nMy brothers surprisingly stood up for her and told me that If she that bad then why am I still living with her and that she was amazing caretaker and took us when our own mother abandoned us so how could I be so selfish and accused her of any less.\n\nIt got really contentious so my sister ended up excusing herself to her room but in the end my brother whom I'm really close too are angry with me. \n\nSo now I'm here wondering if I was wrong for  calling my sister out.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How grateful I am that she went through all that without ever letting us go without, go hungry, and not feel resentment towards us\u201d\n\nUnbelievably entitled and ungrateful move to make her feel awful for something like this.  Just\u2026 wow.", "YTA. You\u2019re not her child. \n\nAs tough as it is to understand, she didn\u2019t have a choice with all of you.

Look, your feelings are valid. But she sacrificed a hell of a lot to care for you and your siblings.

She could have let you and your siblings go into foster care, but she kept all of you guys together.

You should direct your anger at your birth mom who abandoned you, not your sis who decided to step up and give up her life just for you three.", "Initially I was going to say this is a hard Y T A.  Your sisters sacrifice for you and your brothers is such an act of love. She really is a hero who kept the family together. Truly moving. I thought how can you treat her so terribly and be anything but grateful....but I really can\u2019t imagine being abandoned by both my parents as a child and being raised by my teenage sister who must have been hanging on by the skin of her teeth.  I imagine when you see your sister with her child it must be painful.  Maybe instead of actually being mad at your sister, what makes you so upset is you didnt receive this level of care and love from your mom. You were cheated big time; all of you were. You need to apologize to her and tell her:  as amazing as she was and how grateful you are to her for saving your family, it still hurts you got cheated out of having a loving mother.", "YTA. Your sister dropped everything at 19 to care for her 3 younger siblings, she worked 3 jobs to make ends meet, she was a child raising children. She's now in a marriage, older, settled, less financially stretched, of course she's going to be a little more patient.", "YTA. A selfish AH.", "You\u2019re two years away from the age she adopted you never mind the fact that she was probably already taking care of you at the age you are now- You don\u2019t have the capacity to treat Her with kindness understanding and compassion but you think that you would be able to do that to 3 children with 3 jobs? Lol ok", "Gentle YTA\n\nI can see where you are coming from. Obviously you have had a rough start to life and remember how stressful your sister was trying to raise you and your siblings.\n\nBut there's two points you need to consider here. The first is that you want your sister to apply the same way she used to deal with you as a child spilling a glass of milk that she does for her toddler. It's not the same. A child can understand more of the waste of milk than a toddler can. I have three years between my children, and I expect more from the elder than the younger.\n\nThe second point is that people change. Circumstances change. Your sister is now happily married and that spilled glass of milk isn't going to mean the difference it did back then.\n\nMy own family has some large age gaps, and I've seen it happen with my siblings. I've made peace with it, because the only other option is to cut off all contact with them.", "YTA she was a child raising children. You are old enough to realize that now. She had no clue what she was doing she did do the best she could she provided everything you needed right? You should be happy that she's grown evolved matured enough to be even better to her kids now. You should be happy that she's found some kind of piece after all she gave up for you. Instead you want to pick and fight and act like jealous of a 2 year old? What was your end game to get her to be mean to her kids?", "Wow op. Your sister was only two yrs older than you are now when she took you all in. Lost her boyfriend, worked three jobs to keep you all together etc. it\u2019s ok to feel a loss for the childhood you never had; but to blame your sister who was still a kid herself is just shameful.", "YTA. I can't even. Be grateful. She didn't have to apply for custody and you could have been sent to an orphanage.", "YTA, but only for \"calling her out\".\n\nPart of growing up is realizing that no one -- not even adults -- are perfect. Your sister is right; she did what she could with what she had, and you're doing the same.\n\nYou are absolutely valid to feel hurt and angry, OP, but you don't need to direct it at her. Anger is the part of you that speaks up when you've been wronged, and that's the thing, you *were* wronged. You did not deserve your parents' abandonment, the very thing that landed you in the care of a barely-adult in the first place. No child deserves that, but that doesn't mean that she deserves your anger or resentment. It's quite possible she *also* has resentment at the situation and how rough it was on her -- it seems that she has resolved to do better and be better in the future to these children than she was to all of you. It's not much of a solace, I know, when the hurt is still there. But I know that if you consider the possible alternative (that your sister kept her resentment and continued to be cold and angry to her own children) you'll realize that you'd rather she be gentle now.\n\nThe past can't change once it's happened, but you can pursue some therapy for yourself and do some healing, OP.", "You are currently only two years younger than your sister was when she took on three - THREE! Young children. Can you imagine being solely responsible for kids? Would you maybe be stressed the fuck out and snappy sometimes? She did her best while basically still a child. She is now an adult with ONE small child with the resources and support in the form of a spouse to care for kids. Of course she has grown up and is different now. You need to let this go, and also, yeah YTA.\n\nHell, I am 35, with one job and a whole spouse, and only have TWO small kids, and I am stressed AF. Your sister made it through and raised you. Be grateful for that.", "Nah. Your sister at 19 is a different person from the person she is now. I totally understand how you feel but based on what you wrote she was put in an impossible situation and did the best she could while being a kid herself. Cut her some slack and thank her for all that she's done.", "Are you serious? Your sister literally stopped her life to take care of you, and by your own admission did a great job all things considered. \n\nYes your the asshole (YTA) and should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA", "YTA. Apologize immediately.\n\nETA: in case you were unaware, our brains aren\u2019t fully formed until 25. Your sister was a child, raising literal babies. \n\nAlso, gentle parenting wasn\u2019t a thing when you were younger. There was no way she knew about it back then. She was doing the best she could, with the hand she was dealt. You\u2019ll understand if you ever decide to have children.", "YTA\n\nMaybe she could have been nicer but a 19 yr old took in 3  kids not even in kindergarten and raised them so they never had material needs. Without her, you would have been split up from your siblings and lost in the foster system. So, yes, she was stressed. And now, as a married mom in her 30s with a support system, she is calmer. Maybe stop being selfish and just be happy that her kids will have a better childhood than all of you", "Your sister sacrificed for you, to keep you out of foster care. Yes, you can be angry at not getting the childhood every kid deserves. Yes, you can be angry that your mother left you and your siblings. \n\nBut don\u2019t be angry when the person who raised you (and who fought and put her life on hold to do so) didn\u2019t do a perfect job *when she was 19*.  Nothing you describe is abusive or neglectful. \n\nYou\u2019re 17. Picture yourself with three kids that are not your own but who you love like your own. Picture yourself stressing over being able to feed and clothe them and try to make up for what they lost. Not one kid. Three. \n\nNow she\u2019s married. You\u2019re all almost grown. She has her own young child and the security in life and the time to be able to *actually* mother them, and you\u2019re upset that, when she was still basically a child herself, she didn\u2019t do a good enough job?\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be angry, but you\u2019re misplacing that anger on the person who saved you from foster care. The person you *should* be angry at, and call out, is your mother.\n\nETA: YTA.", "**Edited:** I change my vote.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in your feelings because you see a major difference in the way your sister\u2019s children are treated and the way that you were raised.\n\nBut remember, she was only 19, and she wasn\u2019t experienced at parenting. You have to give her some credit because at least she actually tried.\n\nWith that said\u2026\n\nYour feelings are valid, but you should appreciate your sister for the things she did for you.\n\nYTA.", "NAH it\u2019s commendable that your sister, at 19, volunteered to parent her three young siblings. It is not your fault or hers that she was faced with that situation, or that she didn\u2019t have much support financially or emotionally. You acknowledge that your sister was devoted and made many sacrifices, but was also cold and critical. We can\u2019t know whether your childhood might have been better with a different caregiver. But it is desperately unfair for others to say that you need to be unconditionally, eternally grateful simply because she chose to take on the responsibility of you. As any child does, you deserved to feel wanted in a loving and supportive home. Your sister seems to have tried her best, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to pretend everything was always perfect. \n\nWith all that said, calling someone out is rarely a path to resolution or understanding.    It would be healthier for you to work through your own feelings with a therapist than to try to get validation from your sister.", "Should have treated you worse. Maybe you'd be traumatized enough to be grateful.", "YTA, be a bit more grateful and understanding.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t voluntarily become a parent to three kids at 19 and it sounds like she did the best she could. Do you want her to be snappy with her kid now to make it fair?", "YTA. Your sister loves you so much. Even when you confronted her, she felt terrible. You have to realize that a 19 year old taking on 3 siblings is a life changing event for her. She went from no responsibility to now responsible for 3 kids. Her long term relationship ended. She put her own life aside for you to be able to provide for all 3 of you. One person supporting 3 kids is a lot! You even talked about her being stressed and irritable. It all comes from stress. She worked multiple jobs. You know what ppl do at her age, they party, have fun, go out on dates, travel, do stuff for themselves (just like you will be able to do when you turn 19 because your sister put your needs before hers).\n\nNow she is in a better place. She is financially well, she is a lot older, she no longer has to do it on her own. I'm going to say that since you are only 17, maybe you don't have enough life experience to begin to understand everything your sister sacrificed for you, so some advice. Apologize and apologize hard. She gave up everything for you 3, you need to let her know you acknowledge that and you are grateful for it.", "Didnt get past the first sentence. YTA", "YTA. Wow\u2026 you are an ungrateful brat. Of course your sister was stressed out, she was barely a legal adult herself.", "She didn't want to be a mother at 19. She chose to give up her dream to raise her siblings. She chose to keep you. She is your sister. You are 17 and this is how you act? I hope you are a troll. This is disgusting. YTA you would be a very different person right now with a very different out look on life if your sister didn't step up as a child herself and give up everything she wanted to raise you, if you grew up in the foster care system. Can you imagine where you would be right now without her? She wasn't loving enough but worked 3 jobs to make sure you had food, SAFE housing, cloths and stuff you wanted but it's not good enough. She should have gave more of herself to you. Did you ever think maybe she felt the same way you did? Like it's not good enough and SHE wasn't loved? My God you are so selfish. I hope she just learned what kind of person you really are. Because you definitely showed the whole family. Me me me", "YTA and a complete brat. She was 19 taking in 3 very young kids doing the best she could with little to no support from anyone else. She gave up her youth to raise you guys.

You're very ungrateful.", "What you said makes YTA\n\nBut I can understand where your feelings are coming from. You where 4 years old your sister isn't a sister to you she was/is your mom.

If you had to give up your hopes and dreams to raise 3 kids that are not your responsibility. If you had to work three jobs and still couldn't make ends meet with no education to be able to better yourself.\n\nShe did not have to do that. She chose to do it and her life wasn't that great because of it. Because she sacrificed herself for you \n\nCould you do it and always be perfect?\n\nYour lack of respect and empathy is profound. Very very profound. Your lack of gratitude is appalling. The pain you choose to inflict in the face of her generosity is a major slap in the face.\n\nI am sure she is crying in her room. Your relationship has forever changed and that is on you and your self centered viewpoint", "YTA. Your sister literally chose her siblings, including YOU, over herself in every aspect. With my first I was a single mom. It\u2019s ALOT. Working multiple jobs to keep the lights on and food on the table to come home to more work. It\u2019s just a lot. She didn\u2019t HAVE to do that because y\u2019all weren\u2019t her children, she chose to which says a lot. So I say it\u2019s to be expected that she was grumpy sometimes since she was exhausted and overwhelmed.\n\nShe is now married and has someone to help carry the load. I had my second when I remarried and having another person there makes a big difference. She probably finally has a chance to breathe and doesn\u2019t feel like she is going to snap at any given moment which does give her more patience. \n\nYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t end up in foster care because most likely all of you would have been separated and a lot of the time foster life is far worse than someone getting upset about something breaking.

You are 2 years  off from being your sisters age and being responsible for 3 children - do you think you could do it?", "YTA. She was 19. She didn't choose to get you. She is not your mom.

At 17, you're only 2 years younger than she was when she did it.\n\nI'm sure she wasn't perfect, but she did the best that she could.\n\nParenting is something that most people grow into.

Which is okay to have, but look into yourself. Is the anger towards your sister? Or towards the absence of your parents? It might be good to look into therapy so you can start to let go and grow.

But thoughts like that only do you more harm than good. Your sister surely had your best interest in mind and was also still growing and maturing at the time in which she took you in. Having so much life experience from such a young age has given her the ability to be better for her kids now and though it\u2019s bittersweet, she has you and your brothers to thank for that.

Often times it's also because when people are older they tend to be more established and less stressed about trying to get by on a low income. I can't imagine the pressure your sister was under, only 2 years older than you are now and having to be responsible for 3 young kids?!

What everyone else has pointed out is absolutely true. She did give up basically her whole life at 19 to take care of you. Yes, that was obviously not a burden she was prepared for and she did the best she could. However, everyone here seems to be forgetting you are also not grown and cannot be expected to have the tools to deal with this either. You grew up in a harsh and stressful environment and are the product of that. Your frustration and jealousy are understandable and normal. The question is how do you move forward? A therapist would be much better equipped to help you put everything into perspective and work through your feelings in a productive manner than a bunch of strangers on the internet.

OP just went the wrong way about things.", "Also, she undoubtedly learned a lot from becoming a mother figure so young.", "If you take on responsibility for a child you surely owe them a loving home? I find it weird to read this about someone who was taken in at the age of 4; that's effectively her mother to op. OP is still the asshole but taking on a kid and then saying 'i don't owe you anything' because she made sacrifices seems odd. Many parents argue the same when hurting their kids emotionally as they've provided shelter etc so 'what more do you want' etc", "Reading yours and everyone else comments made me realize how worng it was for me to call my sister out like that especially in front of everyone and I'll definitely do what I have to to make it up to my sister.\n\nI just don't understand why I feel so much anger and even some sadness.", "This comment is exactly what needed to be said. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nOP isn't an AH, but a traumatized kid that went through a lot, and needs support to help process that. Same goes for her sister, and thankfully now she's in a better place to provide that support. I hope both them & their brothers are able to work through their traumas, hopefully with the help of a good therapist. They all deserve to find happiness after everything they've been through.", "FINALLY SOME EMPATHY!!!! \n\nNo one is an asshole in this! It's just a shitty situation!", ">  If your sister is 13 years older than you\u2019re oldest sibling, how old are your parents?\n\nThis is distinctly possible. All it takes is having one child at or a little before 20 and the others when approaching menopause. \n\n>and are you sure your sister wasn\u2019t actually your mom?\n\nUnlikely since the brother was 6yo at the time the sister was 19. She would have had to be pregnant at 12/13 for that to happen. It can happen, but it rightly usually draws a LOT of scrutiny from child protective services.", "I'm not sure making sure someone stays fed, clothed, and has toys counts as treating them like they're worthless", "You said all that just to be wrong", "They are pointing out that this is the only alternative to avoid OP getting mad. Her sister was put in a lose lose situation.", "Okay, yeah, I completely get what you're saying, but what is the sister (or your mom) supposed to do about the situation now?", "She said it was \"unfair\" she didn't get the \"gentle\" side. OP should be old enough to understand that life isn't fair & while her childhood wasn't as good as her sister's kids, it could have been far, far worse. The way she presented her feelings about it were guaranteed to make her sister feel guilty about now being much better at parenting & that's just messed up.", "My mom was super hard on us as kids and now she has grandkids and is the complete opposite with them. It can be hard to watch sometimes because they have all this wild, messy fun and she lets them be kids. She plays with them all the time and brings them treats to school almost every day. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to not feel like I missed out on actually getting to be a kid and having a fun mom who played with them. I\u2019ve spent a few adult years in therapy unpacking it, but I also learned to give my mother some grace and patience, though it\u2019s not always easy. \n\nShe definitely didn\u2019t have it easy and did the best she could with what she had at the time. Things were different back then too. There\u2019s a lot more resources and online communities to turn to now. I mean, is anybody knocking the parenting thing out of the park the first time? You pretty much just do your best and hope your kids come out of it with the least amount of issues.\n\nShe says now that she\u2019s a better grandma than she was a mom. But even my sibling had very different treatment as a kid (and still now) than I did. So it\u2019s hard to not hold onto that anger. I\u2019m sympathetic to OP, but she\u2019s still young. Just a kid. I was very angry at that age too. Hopefully more peace and grace comes with time. It\u2019s not a great feeling.", "This! I was just about to say the same thing, but you beat me to it. OP understands her elder sister's sacrifices she made to keep the family together at such a young age. OP should also understand a 19-year-old isn't exactly a fully grown adult either. Especially since she didn't exactly get a parenting manual for three younger kids.\n\nYTA OP. You should've been a bit more considerate of what she's done to keep you from going to foster care. Was she perfect back then? Of course not. She did her best. So don't hold that against her.", "Surely it's also completely normal to be sad or even resentful seeing the person that raised you treat someone else so much better when you were berated and shouted at by your caregiver? And op is just 17. \n\nOP you shouldn't have called her out about it in front of people but I completely understand the feeling. It's probably worth talking to her about and understanding her perspective.", "Extra cruel, because I have no doubt that someone who would give up the end of their childhood/early adult years to care for three siblings already feels guilty for every time she was short-tempered. She sacrificed so much and accomplished so much, but now she must feel like a failure. I'm glad she is able to enjoy motherhood now with less stress and anxiety. \n\nShe was just two years older than OP when she took on the responsibility of three very young children. OP needs to reflect on how ready she would be to handle that kind of pressure. There's really not that much difference between 17 and 19 when it comes to something like this. \n\nThe past is over. You can't change it. The substitute parent relationship needs to be set aside and they need to work on just being sisters. A relationship of equals - but maybe with a little more gratitude and doing things to help her sister out (which OP may be doing now, but I say this just in case she is still treating her sister as her primary caregiver.)", "Very cruel and ungrateful words from OP. Her sister suffers for so long and now op won\u2019t even let her live a little and be happy. I hope her sister finds this thread", "Hugs to you! You can do this!!", "What abuse? Her sister raised her voice sometimes when she was frustrated? Sure, being yelled at sucks and it can be hurtful (especially to kids) but abuse?? That's a stretch.", "But you expect 17 yr old OP to perfectly understand the why of it and never express her emotions about it bc.... Idk why does being 19 get you a pass on verbal abuse but being 17 doesn't get you in asking an admittedly hurtful question?", "This right here...", "Are you saying truthful people have better grammar? Odd.", "People deserve not to have to go through terrible things. Doesn't mean they don't happen, and in this case those things weren't her sister's fault.\n\nI can have empathy for this person's actual problems or issues without coddling them for their entitlement. I'd exhort you to try to do the same. This young woman is 17, and not a mature adult, I'm unsurprised her view on this issue is entitled and immature.", "> her BF absconded\n\nAgree with everything else you wrote but this. Her bf made a rational decision for a 19 year old, it's not like he bailed on his own kids. Absconded has such a negative connotation", "So you would rather have been separated from her and your brothers  and in foster care?", "She's loving with her child because she had practice RAISING 3 OTHER CHILDREN", "She's his mother. Take your disappointment up with YOUR mother. She did something amazing stepping up to take care of you. She gave up her freedom, her relationship, and pretty much all of her 20s. She lost out on all that because she wanted to make sure you three were OK, but that's not good enough for you?", "I\u2019m sorry that you felt unwanted as a child but that is an issue you need to take up with your parents. Your sister was basically the same age that you are now\u2026 Could you take in three kids and raise them? Your sister sacrificed her youth to ensure her siblings didn\u2019t end up in foster care. She took on the role of a parent to kids she didn\u2019t choose to have\u2014 the situations are not comparable. Your sister is older now and has likely learned from her mistakes, and I\u2019m sorry to be blunt, but of course it\u2019s different with her own baby she chose to have. That doesn\u2019t take away the love she has for you, but as I said, it\u2019s just different. You will hopefully understand when you get older.", "You were unwanted by the mother who abandoned you, not the teenage sister that raised you.", "Do you have any empathy of what your sister went threw to make sure you had a stable living environment? You want to take your anger and resentment out on someone take it out on your bio mother who left you.", "Maybe you grew up feeling that way because you were abandoned by your parents, who should have loved and cared for you and you are blaming your sister because she's the only one around. You should think about talking to a professional before you sabotage your relationship with these unresolved feelings - that aren't your sister's fault. She did her best. She was only 2 years older than you are now - how would you handle raising three kids? You don't even have the emotional control to watch your sister being nice to her own kids without saying something mean.", "She was practically a child raising you. You should be grateful your stupid ass didn\u2019t end up in foster care.\n\nI hope she kicks your ungrateful ass out. You don\u2019t deserve her kindness.\n\nYTA.", "You probably were to no small degree. You were an unfair burden she never should have had to carry but she carried it because she loved you.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, you don\u2019t deserve her.", "I mean like, you weren\u2019t her kid. Also, you may have deserved a better childhood but don\u2019t you think SHE deserved not to have her life derailed by 3 small kids when she could barely manage herself?", "You were unwanted. Accept that and move on.\n\nAt least you had someone to take care of you. Appreciate that.", "If you were unwanted she wouldn't have given up her whole life to raise you.\n\nYou need therapy, obviously there's some serious trauma you haven't faced. Your sister could probably use some too, she gave up her life for you.\n\nYTA, get help.", "You felt unwanted because you were unwanted by your parents. She's not your parent and THAT is where your frustration should lie.", "You're 17 now-get therapy and grow up.", "Woooow.  How did her sister mistreat her?  Even her brothers said that the sister was amazing and selfless.  Not to mention OP is still living in the house and has been part of this gentle parenting for the past several years.", "Are you fucking kidding me? Lol like come on, give your head a shake, she was practically a child herself and under immense stress and probably did her best under the circumstances. I wouldn\u2019t have done it.", "Do you think it\u2019s maybe because your angry at the person who should\u2019ve raised you, like your parents. You need to go to therapy. YTA and I hope you delve into why you want a two year old and unborn baby to have the same life as you had. You obviously resent the way your sister treats her kids, and you need to work that out.", "That anger you feel you harbour towards those that abandoned you but you took it out on your sister. \n\nHave you got access to counselling at your school? It would really help to talk to someone about this. Bottled up anger will only fester.", "You have right to your anger and sadness, but you're directing it all at a wrong person. Your sister did all she could, to the detriment of her own well being. \n\nI think you would benefit a lot from therapy, you should get this anger and hurt out in an safe environment.", "Your anger is misplaced. You should be mad at your actual parents who abandoned you. \n\nI used to be a CYS lawyer. It breaks my heart to tell you, but there are a lot of kids in bad foster homes. Even though you didn't feel it, I promise your sister loved you more than anyone else could have. Give your sister a hug, tell her you're sorry, and ask her to help you set up counseling. \n\nIt's ok to be upset about circumstances that were beyond your control, but you need to start now addressing them so you can become a happy, stable adult.", "Oh sweetie. You didn\u2019t deserve what life gave you. Your sister did her best, but it doesn\u2019t magically make you ok. Are you in therapy?", "As others said, I think it\u2019s misdirected, however, you are angry and sad about the life you absolutely should have had. Not a lot of people understand the trauma that happens with foster care, even if it\u2019s with family. You lost out on a lot of what is supposed to be a given for your childhood. I\u2019m glad you are going to make it up to your sister, and I hope you can work through those feelings somehow.", "It sounds like you have a lot of very reasonable grief to process about the way your childhood went. It\u2019s okay to be hurt by your sister\u2019s parenting style when you were younger. It\u2019s okay to be mad that you were treated in a way that made you feel unloved. The work you need to do now is unpacking all of that and learning how to love the woman who sacrificed so much for you, while acknowledging her basic humanity, fallibility, and struggle. You\u2019ve got some deep wounds around attachment and it is some serious work to fix that\u2014but there\u2019s almost nothing more worthwhile to do. Processing the grief of your childhood will allow you to be a better adult, and have a better relationship with your sister. \n\nThink about it this way\u2014when you see how she is with her child, and you think of how different it is from how she raised you, imagine how much pain that must cause her. The way she acts now is the way she believes ALL children should be parented, and she COULD NOT GIVE THAT to you. I suspect she is probably burdened by a deep, painful sense of guilt and failure over how you were raised, because she simply couldn\u2019t provide for you in ALL the ways she wanted to. Even if she was older, more mature, if you\u2019re working crazy hours for basic survival, stressing every moment of every day about how you\u2019re gonna keep food on the table and pay the bills, you simply *cannot* be as emotionally available as you would if you weren\u2019t so busy, sleep deprived, and stressed. \n\nSo again, when you see her parenting her children, assume that\u2019s what she wanted for you, and what she would have given you if she could. And I\u2019m certain she knows it\u2019s not fair that you didn\u2019t get it.", "You\u2019re only two years younger than your sister was when she became a full time parent.

You deserve time to process these issues.", "Get if Reddit get to your sister, apologize and beg her for forgiveness.  Then thank her for all she did for you.  If she accepts your apology, you can, possibly at a later date, express some of your feelings.", "> I just don't understand why I feel so much anger and even some sadness.\n\nBecause it\u2019s easier to blame someone you know who will care about you, than the people who abandoned you. Your childhood wasn\u2019t perfect through no fault of your own. But you\u2019re almost an adult, you can\u2019t push the blame around like this. You should apologize to your sister, tell her you recognize she did the best she could in a shitty situation and ask her to help you find a therapist. You\u2019ve been through so much (and so has all your siblings) and I think you would really benefit from a neutral person to talk to.", "I don\u2019t see why it would be surprising that you have anger and sadness. You had trauma. Your whole family had trauma. You really, really should be in therapy.", "Seeing the happy childhood your neice is having caused you to lash out and mourn what you missed in life. But it's not your sister's fault. Your feelings are normal and I recommend therapy.", "Considering what you went through (losing your parents), it's reasonable to feel anger. Hopefully the anger isn't toward your sister. Just remember, your sister made a great sacrifice when she didn't have to. She actually chose to be a single parent at a time when she herself still needed parents. \nI hope all of you are able to find healing.", "Your pain and the anger it causes are real and valid.  You did not get the affection every child needs.\n\n\nBut that doesn't give you the right to take it out on your sister.  She did the best she could.\n\n\nI strongly suggest you get therapy.\n\n\nHugs.\n\n\nLearn to focus your anger some place healthy.", "Okay, that makes sense. It was concerning to me because I had to wonder if the sister somehow was a victim of abuse (or sexual assault) herself.", "Yelling at and scolding your kids over spilt milk or an accident is not right, but you\u2019re also right that she did at least take care of her siblings the best she could.\n\nShe was young though, and she clearly wasn\u2019t experienced in parenting at the time, but I guess at least she tried.", "Yet you say nothing that backs up your claims that I am wrong. Could you be more specific about what you\u2019re referring to? Because I\u2019m inclined to think you have nothing worthwhile to say just from your sentence alone.", "Why do you assume OP wants a different outcome? Why can't she just express that she's upset about how it went down?", "Why does she have to do anything but acknowledge OPs experience was different?", "Spoiler for OP: life is completely unfair", "Yeah, I mentioned therapy because I'm genuinely baffled that OP doesn't feel ANY remorse for the harshness of what she said. Especially AFTER seeing her sister so upset by her words. OP ending her post by saying \"I'm just wondering if I'm wrong for calling my sister out\" also makes it seem like she's COMPLETELY oblivious to the real issue with what she said/did. To me it reads like, \"They shouldn't be mad at me for saying it like it is!\" \n\nI can understand being jealous that her sister's new kids are having such a very different experience, but it's not her sister's fault. It's an entirely different situation that those kids were brought into. And clearly, her sister wishes things had been different with her siblings, so it's just heartbreaking that OP is being so intentionally cruel. Her sister is clearly being hard enough on herself, she doesn't need OP to make all of her (endless) sacrifices seem like it wasn't enough. \n\nI just hope posting this, and reading the onslaught of YTAs, ends up being the wake-up call she needs to realize how extremely fortunate she is to have that amazing woman as her sister.", "She yelled at a small child over literal spilled milk.", "Um, no. That's not what I am saying.", "I agree. While it sucks that she lost the relationship, bf was in no way obligated to stay and play daddy to the three kids.

Sister is clearly with a partner that she loves and is happy with now.", "Wow", "I would rather have someone who truly loved me", "Absolutely i wouldn't either. She done something monumental, it truly is huge. But i do think you're allowed to be upset if your parents were in shit circumstances like poverty or had kids young and they berated you and it affected you. Many peoples circumstances are bad and it's still upsetting if they weren't able to provide a loving home to their kids, no? Rather then saying they don't owe their children anything", "I also wonder how much bad the yelling or scolding. It sounds like it may be too harsh regardless, but I also know that being reprimanded always seemed harsher when I was younger. I know some children that will get upset even at a firm tone but no raised voice or extended lecture", "You labeled a kid raising her siblings, trying her absolute best with little to no support, as an abuser. Showing moments of frustration is not abuse. OP can feel the way she feels, I'm not saying that. I am saying that her sister is amazing for what she did, and most people wouldn't be able to do it.

I'd be a combination of heartbroken and furious", "Sometimes it's best to keep shit to yourself or your therapist.", "Well op didn't bring this up in a way to grow their relationship.

If the circumstances were different for the caregiver and they acted like this this sub would be saying she's a terrible mother etc and OPs feelings are valid.

That milk was valuable. Many parents are put in the unfortunate position where they cannot afford milk.

But I could also be wrong since that was just how I interpreted it lol, her sister might have really just been stressed and didn\u2019t know how to take on the role that she did, but it\u2019s good that she did take it upon herself to take care of them when their parents didn\u2019t", "Ah, okay. Thank you. I was asking because I deal with a lot of insults in here and I\u2019m not always certain when someone is being serious lol\n\nNo, you\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nThe reason I said this was due to the fact that she noticed a huge difference in the way between the way she was treated and how her sister is treated her children now and was yelling at them over minor things.

So there is a possibility that she considered them a burden, which must have been very frustrating for her as she had to fight herself for thinking that way.  The result of that fight is the way she cares for her children.  That is, not repeat the mistakes she made with you. \n\n You should work on that feeling of abandonment because it could bring you problems in the future.

You are 17 and still referring to yourself as a child. You realise it\u2019s only two years different. Can you imagine yourself in two years taking on 3 kids? Can you imagine how difficult that might be now that you are almost the age she was?\n\nYTA", "While I do understand how you feel, I am sure you would realize what your sister has done for you as you grow up. I saw in your comments that you would rather have lived with someone who loved you.  This world is not that perfect. Foster care/ transition homes/ adoptions are worse than what you went thru. Adoption is not that easy and no one would adopt 3 children as a unit. So you would have been separated from your brothers. \n\nI tell you this. I am 32. I am a mother to a 4 year old. My husband has a stable job. But guess what? There are days that I feel totally overwhelmed, tired with a short fuse. I am a stay at home mom ( for now). Do I look like I resent the child? Yes. But do I resent the child? Hell no. Just because I don't resent my child, doesn't mean I don't get to be tired and burnt out. I miss my job, I miss my free time, I miss my hobbies. I need a time out but rarely get one. \n\n You are now 17. \nIn 2 years, try working 3 jobs and adopt 3 kids that young. Kids are not easy to raise. It might seem easy but it isn't. Even when you plan a child, no one really educates you with the work it entails. If she was able to feed all of you and provide you with some clothes and a roof, that is more than what she could have done. \n\nI feel bad that you didn't have the love you wanted but she did love you. That's where you are wrong. No one can sacrifice so much for a person they don't love. Please don't hurt her like this. Now since you are going to be an adult, I am sure you will understand her love and get to make the memories you want. All loving memories doesn't need to be in childhood.", "YTA \nAll of you had a crappy situation.  She was exhausted,  stressed out and handling way more than any child should.  She worked 3 jobs. 3!!!! And she did it so that you didn\u2019t feel like you didn\u2019t have all the necessities and even had toys.  But it was on a shoe string budget and it would have taken very little for it all to fall apart.  One lost job, broken bone/medial bill, one set of missed work days due to her illness or one of you.  So, spilled milk was a big deal and she likely was also just so tired, stressed and barely holding it all together.  At the same time , you were just kids and these things happen.  Not your fault, either.  No one\u2019s fault but your parents and no one of you kids did anything wrong.  \n\nTo call her out bc she is now able to have some support,  peace in her life that allows her to be calm when these things happen is so crappy.  She could have left you to foster care and cps.  Be appreciative and grateful. It\u2019s ok to wish for more caring and support but your anger should be directed at your neglectful and crap parents.  It shouldn\u2019t be directed at the one that has always been there for you and put you and your siblings before herself.", "YTA get over yourself. You have no right calling her out on anything! You should be thanking her every day for what she did for you.", "YTA. I get you\u2019re still young and cannot even understand what strength your sister has, to accomplish raising three children with no partner and the sacrifices she made for all of you even the ones you don\u2019t even know about.

If she is a different parent now, that is totally normal. She has grown and matured.", "YTA. If everyone had 3 practice kids before they have their own kids, parents would probably have much better relationships with their children. You should have some grace and decency towards your sister, considering everything she did for you. Honestly you sound really ungrateful. Sounds like you could have been in an orphanage or a foster home if not for your sister sacrifice. I\u2019m sure she loves you, I\u2019m sure she was overwhelmed. Tell her you are glad she got to practice on you so she could get things right for her own children, and thank her for taking care of you. Tell her love her and I\u2019m sure you can fix things between the two of you.", "Sorry OP, but YTA. Your feelings of wanting a nurturing mother is completely valid, and since your sister took on a parental role, I can see how you projected these feelings onto her. But she is not your mother. It sounded like she sacrificed a lot and did the best she could at the time of raising you. While that doesn't, and shouldn't, invalidate your feelings, it is also unfair to project them towards your sister. If you have the means, therapy would be very beneficial in helping you tease apart your feelings and process them.", "Yah, YTA.", "Her best wasn't good enough - I get it. That's rough.

Then you can tell us all about the gentle parenting you\u2019re doing with them. \n\nYTA. By your own account, she gave you everything while still being a kid herself. You should be thanking her everyday for taking such good care of you. You definitely shouldn\u2019t be complaining that she wasn\u2019t a perfect parent.

Please find compassion and gratitude through a counselor.", "OP you are a big gaping ungrateful AH. Shame on you. YTA.", "Let's recap. So your complaints are that\n\n* She doesn't behave the same way at 32 that she did at. 19\n* She doesn't treat the child she birthed the same. way that she did her siblings\n* She doesn't treat school aged children the same way she does a 2 yr old.\n\nIn an impossible situation, and still a child herself, every hour she worked in and outside the home was an act of pure love.\n\nApologize. Then thank her profusely for all that she did and continues to do. Then do some housework so she can enjoy some extra cuddles with your niece .  \n\n\nEDIT:  NAH.

Would you be able to do that now with grace and charm and gentleness and maturity? She was a child raising three children. You should get therapy to deal with your anger and stop hurting her.", "YTA", "Sorry, but instead of praising her for overcoming her difficulties and challenges, you called her out for being a good parent? I understand the pain of seeing something that you clearly missed, really. But you should not focus on how she tried her best with the limited resources she had. I see you are only 17 - soon, if you decide to have your own family, you will see how much stressful is to see a child and now that you are the only thing keeping them alive (food and shelter).

She's the only parental figure you've known and seeing that she's only considered you an obligation would sting.\n\nNo child should have to internalize their caretakers resenting them. All children deserve stable and nurturing childhoods and seeing that she had the capacity for it but didn't express it must really hurt, op. You're valid Op here. Kids do not have to be grateful for their guardian's care, nor should the threat of foster care be used to call children entitled for wanting a loving home. We would never tell adopted or fostered children this.\n\nI'm sorry for how hard this thread is treating your traumatic upbringing.", "I don\u2019t even need to read all it to say it honestly YTA.

The sister did something monumental for her siblings and it is understandable why she was the way she was, it was a overwhelming situation, but to say someone has to be eternally grateful and never ever resentful over what seems like a lifetime of being guilt-tripped over sacrifices she never had any say in being made for her and living on constant alert over small mistakes is\u2026 Not the greatest way to get a message across either.

Your sister was a child raising 3 children and trying to provide for them on her own. You can never know how hard that had to have been on her.

But she tried her best and is a damn good sister. I know it\u2019s not fair you don\u2019t have true parents, but neither did she. So don\u2019t take your anger out on her.

And be the mother you wanted when you become a mother.", "YTA  I'm sure your sister is aware she wasn't an ideal parent at 19 when she suddenly had 3 young children to take care of all by herself.  The stress must have been incredible. Does that mean that she shouldn't do better now, with age, experience, and far less constant stress in her life?

I don't know what happened that you needed a new caretaker, but it obviously wasn't anything good. Experiencing separation, and the related trauma, is going to leave a lasting mark. \n\nYou were already feeling unwanted and unloved, and you kept that viewpoint when your care was taken on by your sister. I'm sure she couldn't be around a lot due to how much she had to work, but that's not something every kid is going to understand. It's possible your feelings of abandonment kept telling you she didn't want you either, otherwise she'd be home more, right? Maybe you felt she was quick to anger, because she was forced to care for you. You probably thought she'd be so much happier without the burden of caring for you; she could have achieved her dreams, yes? \n\nWhat you don't realize is that her dreams weren't abandoned, she just found something more important to dream for: you and your brothers. She could have walked away. In fact, trying to get you put under her care may have been tricky, because some would automatically write her off as too young.\n\nShe wanted you so much, she worked three jobs! Nobody does that instead of walking away without reason. I'm sure she was angry and snapped at you. She was likely exhausted and scared. Sleep deprivation does horrible things to the mind and body, and she couldn't have been getting what she needed. She was probably terrified she'd fail and lose you to the system.\n\nI'm not one to try and excuse yelling at a child. I wish that hadn't happened for both of your sakes. I only want to help you see there were different reasons than not wanting you. \n\nYour remarks hit her hard, but have you thought about why your words carry that much power? It's because she loves you, and she just heard you tell her how badly you feel she failed you.

I ended up having to be the emotional adult in the house in a lot of ways from a really young age.\n\nThey've also mellowed a *lot* with age and are great with the my niblings.\n\nI heard my dad telling someone about how he chose to change from his violent upbringing to a third party last summer and it was *really fucking hard* to hold my tongue about it. Because when I was a kid, he absolutely had *not* and hearing him spew this rose colored glasses retrospective about my childhood was infuriating. I managed to hold my tongue mainly because my niblings were present, but I was *pissed*. \n\nAt the same time, I recognize two things:\n1. He genuinely was better than his dad. He just had no clue what good parenting was. \n2. He did in fact turn over a new leaf - just not as early as he'd like to believe. He is not who he was 20-30 years ago when I saw him at his worst. \n\nWhat would it do for me to dredge all that up now? Break his heart, expose my niblings to developmentally inappropriate truths, and cause me a shit ton of distress because the axe forgets but the tree remembers so he genuinely can't recall it like I can. He'll say, honestly, that he doesn't remember it like that. Because to him, he lost his temper and then it was over. It was a Tuesday. To me, I was terrorized by having him vent his spleen on my face, hands, arms, back, and/or ass. \n\nAnd I'd do all that for what, exactly? So I can vent my spleen and seek for the umpteenth time something he's incapable of giving me? \n\nNaw, I think I'm good. Instead, I excused myself and had a little cry for what I didn't get in the bathroom and came back when I felt better. \n\nBut it took me 35 years to get where I am. And some therapy.

I can't imagine how hard being a 19YO parent of 3 must've been, and reading between the lines, OP's early childhood probably contained some emotional abuse and neglect and to her it probably feels either like favoritism or like hypocrisy. Both of these can be true. \n\nThis is one where I will call NAH because if my parents had matured 5-10 years faster I could see me doing the same damn thing.

Letting the anger and pain go and processing and accepting what has happened can help the healing. \n\nOP, you can do this!

But OP is entitled to have opinions about having experienced abuse.", "I think I\u2019m going to be controversial yet brave and give a NAH. Here\u2019s my reasoning. \n\nWhen I was 15, my mom and my brother\u2019s (9 and 7 about) dad divorced, and while she didn\u2019t leave, she did have to be gone because she was working three jobs to provide for us, which kind of left me to be the caretaker for my two brothers. That was a lot of responsibility I bared and it was at times too much for teenage me. When I was 18, I went and got a job and continued to take care of them until they were old enough. \n\nI was stressed, angry, and unfairly had the responsibilities of what a parent had. I was hard on my brothers, and they did not deserve that. Yes, I had it hard myself, and did what I only knew how, but that does not negate the fact that my brothers were treated poorly by me. On top of that, their father made it hell for us. They didn\u2019t deserve that from me, too. And I have since made a point to reconcile that. As should your sister. \n\nYour anger and resentment is valid. You have a lot of trauma and anger that you don\u2019t yet understand. You have every right to be hurt as you see her kids being treated better than you were. She also has every right to be hurt when she sacrificed so much. There is no side to this situation, you both have been so unfairly treated. While I do think she needs to hear you out, I understand what she\u2019s feeling because I\u2019ve also felt that numerous times.\n\nMy brothers have been my homies forever but one of the reasons we are, is because we talked it out and realized the other\u2019s perspective. They hated me when they were kids, and I resented them at that time. But that\u2019s the thing, we were all just kids trying to navigate the traumas we had to go through the best to our knowledge.

Sorry, OP may have been decently provided for but sounds like for most of her childhood had an emotionally unavailable or angry/stressed guardian. Just because she was her sister and only 19 that doesn\u2019t change the perspective or emotional reaction of a YOUNG child for this.  I can\u2019t entirely blame OP\u2019s sister, she was very young and overworked and stressed. But imagine this: if she were her mother, biologically a teen mom, would that change your perspective? Would OP then be justified in her words? If the answer is yes then why? OP is valid in how they feel, probably should\u2019ve discussed at a better time, but still completely valid.

Childhood trauma runs deep and this is something you should look into getting therapy to address. \n\nNow to the next part, I was the sister that took care of the kids because her mother failed to. My sisters (4 of them 4f, 7f, 11f, and 16f) felt abandoned by me when I met my then boyfriend (now ex husband) and moved in with him, so I understand how your sister feels hearing this because when my littlest sister told me something similar it broke my heart. Your sister was a child, she was two years older than you are right now, she took on (willingly I might add) a major responsibility to care for you guys. Think for a moment about being your age, and trying to provide for three very young children. Having kids is hard af and to do it when you never expected to, with no support, and so young, wow. You\u2019re 17 so stop and think how you would feel if someone dropped 3 young children on you right now. No help, no money, and now you have to provide EVERYTHING for them while also knowing your own mother abandoned them and YOU. Your mom abandoned her too, and I think you need to put yourself in your sisters shoes and see this from a different perspective. From the perspective of a very stressed out teenager trying to figure the world out, but already having such a huge responsibility that you don\u2019t even have time to build a life or identity of your own. She probably is very aware she wasn\u2019t the most patient and kind to you three, but she was working with what she had at the time. It\u2019s ok to express how you feel just the delivery could\u2019ve been smoother. Maybe instead of focusing on how bad she was, you could see her growth. She\u2019s grown and learned from her past and is now more patient and kind and that\u2019s great! Would you be happy if she treated your nephew the same way she treated you at that age? Probably not, right? She isn\u2019t your mom. She was forced to step into that role when your mom failed all of you. Show her some grace and have a good conversation with her once you\u2019ve both calmed down, and again shift the perspective. After all, that is how we gain empathy and compassion for each other.", "YTA- I took in my teen sister when I was 22, even with three more years than your sister and only one teenager to care for, it was stressful af. By the time she moved out I was suicidal. I joke with my sister now about how she was my practice child, because I made a lot of mistakes and learned so much about how I could/would do better when I have my own children. \nYou're 17 now, how about you take in a 5yr old and see how well it goes, you think being two more years older is going to make it that much easier? Plus two more kids!?", "Yta I\u2019m your sister in this situation. It\u2019s such a slap in the v face.  I\u2019m sorry you went through something horrible.

I made many mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes with my second. But I did better. My youngest is benefiting from my growth as are her older brothers. As your children grow so do you. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say you shouldn\u2019t be upset with her about her treatment towards you. Stress and grief and insecurity can make you very nasty and I do not doubt her actions have caused you lasting hurt. She made you share her emotional burden when you were incapable of understanding it. What you need now is a therapist to process.", "I agree. YTA. \n\nOP, it sucks your childhood was so rough but your sister was a child. Also, you're not her kid. She didn't ask to be a parent at that time. She was struggling raising her siblings. Now she's at a more stable time and able to care for her own children in a better way. Do you want less for them? She's your sister, not your mother. Give her a break. She obviously loves you so much to sacrifice the way she did.", "YTA , let's not forget her kid is only 2 years old! Do you want her to yell at a child who won't even know what she is saying or why she is saying that?", "can we all cool it on OP a bit?

OP has legitimate feelings about how she was treated. A better route would have been a conversation, maybe even with a therapist. You can be grateful for someone and still be legitimately hurt by their actions. OP is 17 and could use a few sessions with a therapist just for herself. OP, you could apologize to your sister and tell her  both things: how grateful you are and why it hurts to think back on those days. Be gentle. And listen carefully to her reply. You need each other and you\u2019re both good humans.", "no OP doesn't suck.  OP is still a child, one who didn't have a loving adult when she was very young.  OP is just sending resentment in the only direction she has available.  \n\nYes, the sister is not at fault, did the best she could.  But OP still had a messed up childhood.", "OP is 17. Chill with the \"You suck\".", "Good lord, she\u2019s 17, speak gently.", "This feels harsh. I agree with the judgement but I don\u2019t think OP, a 17yr old that was abandoned by her parents and then raised by her incredibly stressed out teenager sister, sucks for having a selfish and inconsiderate moment. OP is right, it isn\u2019t fair she and her brothers didn\u2019t get raised by someone that was ready and mature enough for responsibility. OP is wrong to place the blame for that on her sister though. Maybe it\u2019s a perspective issue but I hope someone asks how OP would feel if she were to suddenly have 3 young children completely dependent on her how she\u2019d fair, since she is barely younger than her sister when she became legal guardian. The grace we all believe OP\u2019s sister deserves because she was young and struggling is the same we should extreme OP because she\u2019s young and struggling. \n\nI hope this is a growth moment for the family and y\u2019all go forward with more compassion for each other and a deeper understanding of one another\u2019s experiences.", "Seriously!

At nineteen you\u2019re still regulating your OWN neurochemistry and problem solving, let alone the added stress of running a whole freakin household and keeping three kids alive. The fact that she took care of three little kids at that age and worked three jobs is amazing. I am sad for OP that she didn\u2019t get to have a parent who had the right resources to provide a safe and nurturing environment, but the absolute last adult to fault for this is the sister. \n\n(Just in case it\u2019s not clear I\u2019m in no way comparing teaching to what this woman did, and feel horribly guilty for my own behavior!!)", "He\u2019s still living with her.\n\nIs he ready to move out and start being 100% self sufficient now with no safety net?

If its real he should recognize how lucky he is to have her be his sister.", "One thing to realize is that, even if she doesn\u2019t talk about it, she FOR SURE feels guilty about that now. When we learn better, we do better. She has learned how to be a better parent and I guarantee she is 100% aware of her failings with you. \n\nI have major regrets about some of the ways I handled things with my oldest as a baby/young child. I was trying REALLY hard. I was seeking out the advice of other parents and my pediatrician, but there was no way for me or any of them to know that she had ADD and accompanying sleep issues.

There is really no greater show of love than someone choosing to take care of you when they absolutely don't have to and have no responsibility to do so.\n\nWe also don't have a clue if OP is the kind of kid who makes the same mistake over and over because they are careless and largely selfish and not caring about improving themselves or making it easier on the people around them or if it was a one off accident.\n\nOps sister WILL yell at her own kids, just because you won't necessarily see it doesn't mean it won't happen, every parent yells at their kids sometimes. \n\nMost likely OP made lots of mistakes that the sister was caring and understanding over and OP remembers the negative experiences more because that's both normal and what happens to everyone. Op is just fixating on them and ignoring all the signs of love and nuturing shown by the sisters actions in taking care of them. You can still be pissed off about your upbringing and it may turn out the sister was much worse than shouting over a glass of split milk, but we see no evidence of that. \n\nMost likely this is displaced anger at OPs mum who abandoned them and because sister was the only one around to blame for everything OP spent their life blaming their sister for everything that went wrong because she's not OPs real mum and so now has major issues over it.", "Not to mention.

You're not wrong for *feeling* that way; you feel cheated because you did not have the life you feel you were supposed to have, the life that most people take for granted. I'm in a somewhat related situation where what I'm dealing with is poverty, and yeah, I've dealt with some *intense* anger over it. No one sits down and consciously decides to feel that way, we just *do.* I think you *can* think yourself out of it, but it's more an unconscious reaction; maybe you can logic yourself out of it, but it doesn't *come out of* logic. You feel hurt and angry; your emotional mind is not sitting here weighing everything out and deciding what's fair. It's kind of a survival tactic: that feeling is there to push you to assert yourself and get what you need... But it's maladaptive in this situation because there's no actual enemy; it was just a terrible situation for everyone involved.\n\nI think that's a good decision; you seem like a good kid who's been dealing with some really heavy stuff, and... I think the people getting super-defensive of your sister and at the same time acting all shocked about what you did lack self-awareness. (Not talking here about the ones who voted YTA but are understanding: in this sub, you can be *the* asshole in the situation without being *an* asshole in general. Saying someone's the asshole here is more like saying you're the one who was wrong in this situation.) Why should she get a pass for being irritable in the past (I think she was TA back then), while you're expected to handle your emotions perfectly? I mean, don't get me wrong, snapping wasn't a great thing to do, but I think it's the same as what people are saying about your sister: your emotions run high when you're young, and you're still in the process of learning. I mean, do your best and all, but of course you're not always 100% mature, of course you lack perspective. *Part of how you develop in that way is through experience.*", "You long for a mother-daughter relationship that you were deprived of.

It isn't how children are meant to grow up, it's not what their entitled to. Whether or not your sister is blameworthy I think it's completely reasonable for you to feel anger and sadness around this.\n\n\nAs for whether your sister is blameworthy, from what you write it sounds likely that she really was a stressed kid doing her best, and yeah no kidding her best wasn't the best, she was very young in a very difficult situation. Taking care of your material needs was already pretty major, and suggests that she did love you even if she didn't make you feel it or know that was an important thing to do. And now she's a much older adult, with the experience of raising several children under her belt (ask us older siblings how our baby brother got raised compared to us...), who has more support and less stress and had time to reflect on her experiences and read more parenting books. Again, nothing surprising in her parenting children differently now, and it's pretty encouraging that she's apparently doing it much better.\n\n\nBut maybe this first-pass impression is wrong; maybe she *did* mistreat you or genuinely resent you in ways that were unfair to you beyond the pure unfairness of the situation. You're the only one who can really answer this question for yourself (your siblings definitely seem to have an opinion but people not acknowledging abuse that exists happens all the time so it doesn't prove things either). Either way I don't think it's fair to hold her better parenting of your niblings against her this way, but it's probably worth talking to someone about these feelings you're having. Maybe even her, if you think you can make it a healing conversation and not a fight where you both hurt each other.\n\n\nA question occurs to me; do you *still* feel unwanted, and like she doesn't love you?

But you were a child who was being raised by another child and in the end you both suffered as a result. \n\nI also think it's fucked up that a lot of redditors are saying that you should be grateful to your sister because if it weren't for her, you'd be out on the streets, in foster care, etc. Traumatized children should never be obligated to feel grateful to their caregivers because \"it could have been worse.\" I feel the same way when people tell adopted children to shut up and just be grateful that they were adopted. \n\nI think your entire family would benefit from family therapy. Therapy isn't a panacea, but maybe it could help you start to unpack your understandably complicated feelings about your childhood.", "You're alright, OP. NAH. I hope you and your sister can work things out. You're allowed to be frustrated with how you were treated as a kid and how rough that must've been, to feel like a burden on top of being abandoned by your mother. I get that people want you to be more appreciative of the difficult circumstances your sister found herself in, and there's certainly room for that, too, but it doesn't mean you can't wish you'd had gentler parenting. Someday, you can talk to a professional to work through these things, and maybe you can bring your sister along and figure out how to heal together.", "I get she was 19yrs old and all and she was working 3 jobs and all  and must\u2019ve been extremely stressed and everything but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that according to OP she was hard on them, they were 4, 5, and 6, I am sure this took a toll on OP too, I mean I am sorry, I feel more sorry for the 4 yr old than the 19yr old, I mean life can be so difficult at times but I don\u2019t see why people have more empathy for a very young child  than a 19yr old who did choose this. I have read other stories on here of people who were in similar situations and their siblings didn\u2019t post like OP here, they post here singing praises, now I don\u2019t believe any of them had that many kids at once and so so young but I know one became a \u201cprofessional\u201d if you know what I mean to support her siblings and they only spoke glowingly of her, if anyone was going to be snippy it probably should\u2019ve been her, you can have empathy for the sister but not denying that she made OP feel bad for doing things that all kids do and, everyone has accidents and sometimes drops things, doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t be able to vocalize her feelings about someone who made her feel like she was agitated by them and given speeches for \u201cmistakes\u201d. I think Reddit got it wrong this time. OP, you are NTA. And I am sorry your brothers don\u2019t see your viewpoint, maybe they weren\u2019t as sensitive as you were but they could be empathetic to your point of view. This should\u2019ve gotten at least a N A H, having empathy for OP\u2019s sister and the CHILD in the situation.", "NAH. A teenager probably still struggling with childhood trauma is hurt to see that the person who was thrust into parenting her is giving a new child what she needed? 100% understandable. I hope therapy is accessible to you.\n\nAnd, a teenager deciding to take on the responsibility of parenting three babies? And finding it more stress and hardship than she knew how to handle, struggling? Then doing better when she learned better? Not an ah, either.", "YTA hat a brat! At 19 your sister didn\u2019t get to be a young person but was forced into being a parent. She worked 3 jobs and burned herself out so that you never had to go without. She wasn\u2019t able to nurture you because she had nothing left in the tank!\n\nDo you realise how entitled you sound? She gave you everything she had and it still wasn\u2019t snitch!  Why not demand a kidney while you\u2019re at it! \n\nSMH at the skewed reality some people live in", "Agree with YTA. \n\nAnother way of thinking about this is: as soon as you compare yourself to anyone, you are going to lose. This is the case if it's your nieces, your peers, your own kids (when you have them).\n\nThe past is the past. In fact, the past is fake anyway because it exists in your own mind with your own perceptions. Your older sister likely has a very different take on your shared past. This is why the past doesn't really mean anything other than lessons learned. To compare anything in the present to the past is folly.\n\nWhat is the practical advice? Well, you only have the present to contend with. Concentrate on what you should do now regardless of your past. What is it that you can do to make your situation better?  Confronting your older sister based on your own perceived past will not make your situation better. Will it change the past? No. Besides, what is fairness in this situation? Doesn't exist. It's apples and oranges.\n\nWhat does the OP need to do next? OP should strive to treat people with the same patience OP wanted before and now. Make sure that your sister treats you now the way she treats her children now. Other than that, appreciate your present, set up your future, walk forward.", "I don't buy the excuse of being to young to understand what their sister did. 17 is old enough to realise how badly her sister's life was affected because of the responsibility of 3 young kids. By OP's own description, she is well aware of the changes in her sister's life because of the decision to take in her 3 siblings. She knew her sister was working 3 jobs, and were constantly stressed. Surely she understands living that way at almost the same age as OP is now, had to suck?", "OP should become mother to three next year when she turns 19 to see how great she is.", "Yes. The other thing I want to say is your sister probavly learned a lot from raising you 3. It is NOT  that she did not loved you. She was still raising herself and trying to do the best she could. Now she is in other position and has other perspective, support and emotional tools to deal with raising kids. \n\nRaising kids take a village. Im sorry that you did not have the support you needed when you were a kid.", "I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying they suck. They\u2019re young, and are allowed to have their own feelings. I\u2019m sure trauma is involved for a 19yo to be able to get custody. This person displaced their emotions from not knowing how to handle them. \n\nBut seriously, your sister is an amazing person. I super recommend therapy so you can work through your feelings", "I say disrespectfully, OP sucks. YTA. Just two years older than you are now she took you in, gave up her dreams to take care of you and you are moaning that your nieces/nephews have a better childhood than you??? Really?

She definitely did the best she could!

IMAGINE how that would make her feel???? Like she sacrificed all that for nothing because you are still gonna be unhappy and complain about your childhood. \n\nI know your young and your probably don\u2019t have the understanding wha tit actually takes to look after one kid let alone 3 \u2026 it is VERY demanding and you will realise how wrong you are one day when you have kids of your own.", "That\u2019s very harsh.

I always told mine that yes I may fly off the handle once in awhile, but I calm down and always apologize.

I get it they a had it bad but sis had it the worst. It kills me that OP is complaining about not having had more when sis was in every sense, burning herself to keep them alive. She gave up her life. Things are good now but there was no guarantee.  For OP to be saying this at an age so close to when their sis suddenly became parents to 3 kids.... they have to be pretty stuck in their own perspective.", "I think it's pretty messed up, when a child talks about being mistreated by a caregiver, that this is a reaction. \n\nIt's basically telling them that their feelings don't matter and they're lucky anyone cares about them at all. \n\nLike, yeah,.it's amazing that she took care of them. She didn't have to. \n\nBut she probably snapped here and there. I definitely did, when I used to take care of my dad.

How many 17 year old can convey those feelings in a healthy was as to not hurt the sister? Especially being so emotionally stunted.", "Aw sweetheart, that's totally normal. You're grieving what you should have had, and you're a little jealous watching those kids get it. Especially since it's coming from the same person who raised you. It's not your sister's fault though. And it's not yours either. Your little family had to struggle so hard, and it wasn't fair.\n\nMaybe look into getting some therapy. I bet it'd help a lot.", "I hear you. My mom was rough with us but so patient with my kid that I get angry sometimes. Why didn't I get that? But i have to remember she worked 2 jobs, and cooked every meal (no dishwasher, no microwave, no fast food restaurants) and cleaned (my dad didn't help because our culture sucks ass) and got us to test into private schools on scholarship. Now she is retired and watches TV for fun.\n\nI had to deal with this in therapy for myself. Imagine how crazy I sounded telling someone I was angry because my mother was nice to my kid! You are sad and angry because your childhood was ripped away from you. You have all the right to feel that way, but your sister is not the reason you didn't have it. Someone else is. She gave you all the she could. Your anger is much deeper. You deserved to have had a patient caregiver and all the love, those feelings are valid. But your poor sister at 19 couldn't ever provide it, it's beyond anyone's power at that point. Something forced her to have to give you all of her, and it may have not been the best thing but it's the best she could have done. She is now giving more to her child because she is able to! Not because she chose to save it all up for her children. She truly gave you all when she did. It may not look like her \"giving all to you\" now but then, at that moment, it was. It's just like if you are trying to train for a marathon if you never ran a mile in your life. With training and practice, proper support,  and the right situation, you will get better. I am sure she wishes she gave you as much but she just couldn't, she barely could run a mile. You are hurt and it's  valid but she is not the reason you didn't get that childhood. She is the reason you didn't get something much much worse. I wish all the love and understanding and harmony to all of you.", "It\u2019s just displaced.

Your sister is in proximity to you and the people you want to take out on are not readily available.", "It\u2019s hard to realize how much your sister loves you, and how her reactions were the only ones she could manage at that time, because she was still a child growing up while she raised you.

Your sister probably also felt that way. \n\nParenting for a planned pregnancy with a full partner and the ability to stay at home and not worry about money is hard enough. Parenting unexpectedly at 19 for threes kids with three jobs and no co-parent? Even the best parents would crack under that pressure. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean it was ok to be angry at you, but it is understandable. It might be helpful for you to look at this with your sister on your side where you both share the hurt that was unfair to you both. It\u2019s not you vs her; you\u2019re on the same team.", "Oh sweetheart, you and your siblings had an unfair portion given to and it is complex and not something that someone your age will be able to process fully on your own.

Your sister did the absolute best she could with such an awful situation and you should love and cherish her for sacrificing so much to provide for all of you, even though she wasn't perfect. What you said was a little cruel but you're not an asshole, you just have difficult feelings that need working through.\n\nIgnore all the lame judgment coming from people who likely grew up with more stable childhoods than you, Reddit is a bad place for advice.", "I'm glad to read that you'll apologise to your sister, I agree with the consensus. But I just want to say your feelings are 100% valid. You had a very traumatic childhood. You were left with your sister, who was also still basically a child. You were left with someone who didn't have the developmental skills to know how to take care of you, and no adult stepped in. The pain of abandonment and neglect is so strong, it's no wonder you feel so much anger and pain. It would be very triggering to now see her as an adult able to give care to kids, knowing that no one gave that to you. \n\nI think maybe the anger at your sister is a projection. I don't know what happened with your parents, but I think your anger is actually at them *or* at whatever caused them to not be in your life, as well as possibly other adults or services that didn't step in to help. That is a completely justified and understandable pain to be carrying. Looking into therapy could be helpful - I'm currently trying to heal a similar kind of abandonment wound and the impacts of childhood neglect. I wish you all the luck in the world in your healing.\n\nYou might find some solidarity and ideas for healing at r/emotionalneglect\n\nEdit - wrote the sub name wrong.", "It\u2019s misdirected.

Far less of a hell than what your sister endured but still hell.\n\nBut you\u2019re angry at the wrong person. Your sister was never your mum, she wasn\u2019t ready and never signed up to raise you. If she kicked you out today could you survive on your own, let alone with 3 kids in tow? It\u2019s your parents who did it to all 3 of you, not her. They are the reason you didn\u2019t get a childhood, she didn\u2019t get to be a young adult and her future id still being robbed thanks to it (it\u2019s great she doesn\u2019t have to work, but if she got an education she might have also had a fulfilling career at some point, explored the world and been changed by many experiences she could have had. So many opportunities she lost and can\u2019t get back).  If you re in a place that offers it at affordable rates, gets some therapy. You could use it as you\u2019ve all been through a lot", "I have a lot of anger towards family as well.

Often I fantasize about telling my primary caretaker off for it! You\u2019re not an asshole and I hope you all can work this out-together", "Something you may not consciously understand is that your sister is your safe space.\n\nWhen we look at those kids whom everyone compliments as being \u201cso well behaved\u201d in public settings, we often find at least one parent who is proud but also in disbelief because that child isn\u2019t so well behaved with them. That\u2019s because that parent is their safe space. All of the emotions they hold in, all of the worry and frustration and fear and exhaustion and disagreement and so on throughout the day that they won\u2019t let out because they don\u2019t feel comfortable in their environment, they release that onto the parental figure they feel safe with. And it\u2019s not intentional, it\u2019s just a moment where you finally feel safe and so you let your guard down.\n\nYou are angry, your anger is valid. And you have dealt with a lot. And you feel envious because your sister\u2019s current children have the childhood your parents wouldn\u2019t give you and your sister wasn\u2019t really equipped to provide due to her own young age.

In my house we call them big feelings (most of my kids are fairly small) and many times we say those big feelings happen because we\u2019ve balled up a bunch of smaller feelings and now they\u2019re so tangled up that we can\u2019t really discern why the big feeling exists. \n\nYou need to talk to your sister. Not blame or unleash anger at her. Just ask her to sit down and talk alone, explain what you feel, don\u2019t script it or anything, let the words come as they do.

I'm sure you and your sister will be okay if you talk to her about it. I imagine you are angry and sad because your life has been hard and very unfair from the sound of it. Seeing your sister with your niece/nephew is going to stir up all those feelings - and that's okay. As you grow, your bond with your sister and her kids will probably grow stronger too, and one day, you might look back and find ways that you are thankful for how you grew up, even as unfair as it was.

OP's sister was 19 and gave up a lot to take care of her young siblings, and at the same time OP was 4, separated from their parents and still had an irritable guardian who overreacted to small toddler mistakes, and now as a 17 year old, made a tactless mistake.\n\nJust because the sister was better than the parents doesn't mean that yelling at a toddler for spilling milk or other small things can just be overlooked. She still did things that made OP feel like they had to walk on eggshells in their home, at 4 years old, no less.\n\nI want to stress that what OP's sister did was admirable and a genuinely great thing. It's just that this exceptional action doesn't change that sometimes she acted in ways that hurt OP as a very young child, and it doesn't negate OP's feelings.\n\nEspecially since being in that type of environment can still affect you as you grow older, even if it is more ideal than other alternatives.\n\nMy mom's a much better parent than her mother by a wide margin. She did hard work and was stressed while raising my sibling and I. She still made some mistakes that did impact me, and is now different in ways that do make me a little bitter.\n\nSo I know what Op's thinking: \"where was this when I was a child? Why didn't I deserve this when I was still learning and vulnerable? Why couldn't I have this patience and understanding? It was always in you, but you didn't offer it to me, why?\"\n\nNow, this was not the right time or place. This should have been in private, between OP and their sister, not in front of everyone and her baby. OP should apologize for airing that out in front of everyone like that. Maybe if OP tries individual therapy, they can try group therapy.\n\nOP has a great thing in that their sister can recognize their shortcomings and acknowledges it to their siblings. And also changing their behavior to be more gentle with their child, without needing to be prompted to do so. This means there can be an understanding and that a rift can be mended, so I hope both take this opportunity to become more open with each other and have a great relationship.", "Same.\n\nOP is NTA for being upset that they weren't given the kindness of patience or resources they needed.

You still live with your sister and things have gotten significantly better at home, and you're jealous of a toddler? Your niece/nephew? Here's a new flash and something I heard after I had my daughter that put it into perspective.

I wasn't close to my grandma, and I really don't want contact with my mom in any way, but it did hurt to have my suspicions confirmed; my mom didn't actually care about a reconciliation with her daughter, she just likes having a personal tragedy to get her sympathy.

I don't know if you have issues with self-worth in general, but if you do then you might want to hold on to that feeling of unfairness and of thinking you deserved as a child the kind of patience her children are getting from her - because *you did*. Thinking you deserve things you really do deserve is called \"having a healthy sense of self-worth\". Maybe this was all part of your process of healing. (as for how your mother dying might impact things... I could imagine a child in a similar situation resenting their situation, and partly blaming themselves as being unloveable but also low-key hoping to be rescued one day, for their \"real\" parents who actually love them to show up one day and make everything better. And if that child had literal \"real\" parents out there they might subconsciously have pinned some hopes on them, like maybe they'd get better or change their minds. And I imagine such a child might feel some kind of way once those parents died and such a hope got dashed. Like the Bojack Horseman quote, \"my mother died and now everything is worse\" because that meant he'd never have the mother he should have had).\n\n\nIn terms of deserving forgiveness, look at it this way - we're all pointing out how your sister was 19, basically a kid, in this horrible situation, but you were 4 to 6, *literally* kids, and just as we might not expect a traumatized 19 year-old working 3 jobs to be a perfectly emotionally available parent, we can't expect 4 to 6 year-olds to just take it on board, be like \"eh, she's doing the best she can, we don't need perfect parenting anyway\" and not internalize this situation as having something to do with them. And you're 17 now! With all that immature prefrontal cortex stuff! Sure, blaming your sister or resenting your niblings would be a response to those feelings that is unfair to them but teenagers will sometimes act in unfair ways, especially to their caregivers.

But u can tell that was never really a option to her cause she worked her ass off to make sure you never went without. She really is a special person and that\u2019s who you have as a caregiver. She actually went through a lot to care for you and most people can\u2019t say they had a caregiver or even mother do that for them. Your a lucky person to have someone love you in this way. But they will always be two separate things and once you can separate that it may be easier to process. No one can ever replace a mother no matter how amazing the replacement is and unfortunately it\u2019s something you are never going to get from ur mother. But as I said look what u had instead and how much she loves u \u2764\ufe0f", "I think op is a she. I think she needs therapy, but only to learn to cope with the trauma. \nChildren are entitled to a nurturing home. The real asshole is the system. In the foster system the foster parents would have gotten several thousands for her end her siblings. Why isn't that money or at least part of it given to her \"foster\" sister to care for them. \nWhat all the y-t-a poster seem to forget is that there are situation where no one is an AH but the situation is crappy anyways. It isn't always black and white. One side being white doesn't necessarily make the other side black, it can be white too or maybe a little grey or anything in between.", "This is spot on. The amount of times I went without meals so my child could eat for the whole week!", "She probably got more upset at milk being spilled because at that time *she was struggling to afford it.* It's easy to say \"don't cry over spilled milk\" when you can just pick up another carton at the corner store. It's much more upsetting when that means someone is going without.", "I do want to point out, that being raised by a stressed out traumatized child who neglected and yelled at them all the time didn't set up OP to be very empathetic or emotionally intelligent in the first place. This is why these things are so often a cycle.", "I think op is female. They say brothers 5m 6m and 4f.", "Op is the female, first sentence says brothers and I", "I think OP is a girl. She says they were 4f, 5m, 6m and then says \"my brothers\" a few times", "Totally agree here. I hope OP and her sister can find a way to talk about their feelings in a constructive, mature way. Talking these things out and getting closure is very important, but also very difficult because feelings are hurt. Her sister *wasn't* a perfect caretaker, or even an ideal one, but she was doing the best she could with what she had and shouldn't be expected to be perfect. But at the same time, these experiences are traumatic for children. OP probably feels robbed of a normal childhood and wishes she had those gentle, loving experiences. This is all natural and understandable, but she shouldn't be taking it out on her sister.", "OP, maybe watch Shameless and try to understand the Fiona character. Being a kid while raising a kid is not easy and many people would not even try... let alone tolerate being told that their best attempts with the emotional toolbox they had (which was likely empty, okay, because parents who abandon don't teach good emotional skills) are not enough years down the line. Let your sister have her own life, OP. She deserves to be happy and so do you. I hope you get help to work through your trauma, but your sister can't do that work for you.", "That is true, I'm not disregarding that OP deserved, that they all deserved better really. But her siblings had enough empathy after having experienced the same and their age difference is marginal. And even if OP wished to address legitimately hurtful things the sister mignt have done in the past, it's done in poor taste to do it as publicly as they did obviously in an effort to shame her in the presence of others. It's not admirable to say the least. Especially considering OP is still in the older sister's care while the sister at just two years older was shouldering the responsibility of suddenly parenting three toddlers. OP like her brothers could cut older sister some slack.", "Tbh it\u2019s probably what she wanted for herself. A 19 year old is still a kid and needs to be nurtured by their parents into adulthood yet overnight she became one instead.", "We dont even know if she truly bereated her over every little thing. I want to hear from the older brothers tbh and the caretaker", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want to call the OP an arsehole because it sounds like she\u2019s still pretty young and probably doesn\u2019t understand how hard being an adult, let alone a parent, is yet (I certainly didn\u2019t at 17).  And she\u2019s probably carrying some unresolved trauma from the loss of her parents.  But OP, imagine yourself 2 years from now, suddenly landed with the care of 3 children and having to rearrange your whole life.  It sounds like your sister did an incredible job under the toughest of circumstances.  You owe her a massive apology.", ">She probably got more upset at milk being spilled because at that time she was struggling to afford it.\n\nThis, plus like someone else said, when you have to tell a child so many times to stop jumping around at the dinner table or not run around with drinks in their hands or whatever it is that their doing that constantly results in spillages that you just can't afford it gets frustrating real quick.", "In another comment OP says that the mother recently died, which I think puts this whole thing in a different light. OP isn't ever going to have the chance to confront her now. She also said she's struggling with feeling sad about the death when she didn't expect it. Sounds like there are just a lot of feelings happening right now, and she unloaded them on the person she could trust not to leave, which is pretty common for teenagers.", "This!!! It was never her sister\u2019s job to nurture and love her the way a mother does. I totally agree with whoever said she needs grief counseling and therapy", "Honestly, the whole situation sucks. OP's sister never should've been forced into that situation. OP and all her siblings deserve a stable loving home. OP's sister clearly was not in the best place to raise her siblings, did the best she could, and unfortunately good intentions don't negate negative consequences. OP is perfectly valid in feeling upset that her sister is now able to be the better parent she never got. However, that doesn't excuse her for throwing it in her sister's face. \n\nI know therapy gets thrown about a lot but OP should really be discussing her feelings with someone who isn't their sibling. And honestly, everyone in that family as well. They all went through a traumatic experience.", "People in general really suck at holding 2 opposing viewpoints. We can absolutely acknowledge that as a 19 year old OP's sisters went above and beyond to raise her younger siblings and at the same time acknowledge that as a 19 year old suddenly forced into being a parent and working multiple jobs just to make ends meet, she wouldn't have been the most emotionally prepared/available parent. OP is valid in feeling upset that they had a bad childhood/was emotionally neglected and also was being an asshole for bringing it up how they did. Leaving space to acknowledge just their sister was emotionally immature, neither is 17 year old OP. All those things can be true at the same time.\n\nEveryone loses when you start comparing and invalidating people's trauma.", "OPs feelings are neither right nor wrong and she has them. What makes her TA is \u201ccalling out\u201d her sister for what she did to keep the family together many years before. OP meant to hurt her sister. That is wrong.", "Those are not the same situations at all", "Adding:  Hell, I\u2019m 48 and if something happened to my brother and his partner I would take in my 2 nieces, but it would not be a happy arrangement.  I\u2019ve chosen not to have children for a reason.  I would try not to take it out on my nieces but damn, it would require iron self-control.  And your sister at 18 would not have had anything like the financial stability and life experience I have.  I get that you\u2019re hurt, OP, and my heart aches for you, truly.  But it aches for her, too, and everything she had to sacrifice to give you and your brothers a decent life.  It was an awful, awful situation that was nobody\u2019s fault.  I strongly recommend therapy for your trauma and I hope you can find peace.", "She unloaded on her attachment figure yes which is normal and what all kids do. But whilst it IS normal, it is also shitty and the easy route. I stick to what i said above, she needs to apologize to her sister and she also deeply needs counselling, to learn how to manage the grief of the mother that abandoned her and the grief of that same mother passing away, so she can hopefully get closure and move on. And i have no doubt her older sister will fully support her with that painful work.", "Poor behavior on the sisters part?  Are you kidding?  A 19 year took in 3 small children and worked 3 jobs.  She was tired, overwhelmed, I\u2019m sure scared\u2026\u2026.  The op got yelled at for spilling milk?  That\u2019s not abuse or some heinous crime.  I yell at my kids too sometimes.  \n\nOp\u2019s sister is a saint and deserves an award for all she sacrificed and made sure these siblings weren\u2019t separated and put in foster care.", "Especially since OP was only 4. What people aren't seeing is that her sister was her mom for all intent and purposes. So it's like seeing your mom favor her other kids over you. This situation just sucks balls all around.", "All I said was that blaming the sister was petty and childish, which is... Understandable for a child.  Which I understand the OP is.  Pointing that out isn't saying OP is a bad person or should be expected to know better already, but it's still possible to do better.  Children learn to do better by having those instances pointed out and being shown a different way to act.  They posted on \"Am I The Asshole\", meaning they're looking for a judgment on whether their behavior was appropriate or not.", "Op\u2019s sister is a saint and does not suck.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is saying that OP can\u2019t be upset, they are just saying that she is upset at the wrong person. Their parents are the ones who messed up her childhood, her sister just tried to give them the best of the bad choices that were left.", "OP\u2019s feelings are valid.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that her sis was not and is not her mother, and it\u2019s unfair to judge her as a mother. I\u2019m not making a biological distinction here, but a relational and emotional one."]}
