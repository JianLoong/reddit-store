She was shocked to hear me say that and started crying saying she did her best with what she had. \n\nMy brothers surprisingly stood up for her and told me that If she that bad then why am I still living with her and that she was amazing caretaker and took us when our own mother abandoned us so how could I be so selfish and accused her of any less.\n\nIt got really contentious so my sister ended up excusing herself to her room but in the end my brother whom I'm really close too are angry with me. \n\nSo now I'm here wondering if I was wrong for  calling my sister out.", "created_utc": 1673388558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108mmfn/aita_for_calling_my_sister_for_treating_her_child/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dropped her **whole life** at *19* to take care of **THREE** kids? \n\nI understand being upset at having a less than perfect childhood, but childhood doesn't magically stop at 18. \n\nShe was *still a kid* when she was taking care of you three. No shit she was stressed and having major difficulty! \n\nAnd now you're looking at her, finally able to be an adult without the frantic panic and you *resent* her for *now having the support* to take care of her children the way she wants too? \n\nOP, respectfully- you suck.", "YTA. Let's recap: at 19, your sister took sole custodianship of her 3 siblings, a task that very few 19 year-olds would even be capable of, let alone willing to do. From your description, she basically killed herself making sure you all got by and apparently did well enough that you are all still around and that she was able to finally start focusing on herself and starting her own family after giving up all of her 20s for you. And you're calling her out for not being perfect at a huge responsibility that she never should have had to take on in the first place?\n\nI hope this is fake because I'm absolutely disgusted by it.\n\nThe only excuse here is that you're still too young to fully understand the weight of this kind of responsibility. But think about it this way, in 2 years, would you be ready to fully care for 3 young children and provide for them while not being stressed out? If not, then go apologize.", "YTA. \n\nYour sister was barely grown herself when she took in 3 children that were not hers. \n\nOf course she was stressed and irritable. Parenting is hard at the best of times but parenting when you're so young yourself in such a complicated situation is next level. \n\nShe constantly provided for you all. She never let any of you down, despite being put in a situation that she should not have had to be in. \n\nNow she is an adult. She has had time to learn, and mature and that is her child. \n\nYou just sound ungrateful, honestly. Was she perfect? No. But it sounds a lot like she did her very best in a diabolical situation.", "Man the experience you went through sucked. But you blaming your sister for not being able to be a proper parent at 19 when she was not prepared to handle three children is a bit entitled.\n\nYou did deserve a happy family environment. You got what she was capable of giving. You're 17. Imagine doing what she had to do right now. Three children, and sacrificing her relationship and youth to make sure you weren't indigent. Be a bit more gracious to her. It's okay to talk about how it sucked, and you're not wrong for having issues or trauma as a result of that, but putting it on your sister is unfair.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  I'm not necessarily excusing her reactions when you were kids, but she was barely an adult herself and sounds like she did everything she could to provide for you materially. She very well may have been/still be resentful, but it seems like she tried to put that aside to take care of her siblings. \n\nYou don't say which sibling you are, but it's been at least 11 years - she's allowed to grow as a person and parent.  I'm not sure what you expected by giving her a hard time. She can't undo how she acted/reacted to you and your siblings, and if you think she was unfair to you, then it's cruel to expect her to treat her children the same way", "Are you for real?", "Listen, I understand where you are coming from, and it's very difficult when you feel like your caretaker resents you.  However, a few key things I saw:\n\n>My sister at one point in time was working 3 jobs to even be able to   \nprovide for us, I never went without food or clothes or even toys.\n\nDo you have ANY idea how stressful it is to work 3 jobs?  On top of that, taking care of 3 children you didn't plan for?\n\n>My sister is now doing much better in life and no longer have to work and is happily married, she has a 2 year old and is pregnant with her 2nd, I seen how she treats  \n them and I can tell she loves them very much, I even watched her   \ntoddler spilled a glass a milk and she was so clam and loving about it,   \nshe even jumped on this new gentle parenting trend.\n\nYou said it yourself, she is doing much better in life.  The entire situation has changed, and she now is caring for children she planned for, and has had more time to learn just how to raise a child.  \n\nYou had a difficult upbringing, and she had a difficult time making sure you were well taken care of.  I don't blame you for being upset at the change in parenting.  Just remember, she didn't go into it saying \"I want to raise 3 young children as a young adult myself\", she went in thinking \"I will NOT let my brothers and sisters be separated, and will do everything in my power to care for them as best I can.\"\n\nYTA, give her some slack.  She was in a very difficult situation, and tried her best to be the best guardian she could with little to no experience.", "YTA.  Your sister is a saint.  And you are absolutely TA.", "YTA\n\nShe was a 19yo caring for three children that she did not choose to have. Of course she was stressed and had less emotional capacity than she does now as an adult who has chosen to have children. And of course she was more stressed about things like spilled milk - she probably was struggling hard to afford that milk.\n\nExpecting anyone to have the same emotional maturity and parenting capacity at 19 vs 32 just reflects your own immaturity and relative lack of experience as an adult.\n\nNo it's not fair that you didn't get your sister and a caring, gentle, patient parent. But the entire situation was horribly unfair to ALL of you. It's unfair to your sister that she had to care for 3 small children when she was barely beginning to be an adult. You are not the only person with feelings in this situation.", "YTA 100% \n\nYour sister wrecked her life purely to support her family and worked THREE JOBS so that you wouldn't want for anything \n\nA 19 year old doing the job of two parents for people who she CHOSE to take in is obviously not going to be perfect. And you're still living with her! \n\nIf your sister suddenly died and you had to take in her children, would you be ecstatic about it at all times?", "YTA- I get that it's hard to live in a household where you are clearly resented, but then she had every right to be resentful. Although you had no choice in the matter, she was sacrificing a lot to provide for you. The thing is now that she doesn't have that stress, she can relax and be nurturing instead of feeling crushed all day everyday.", "I'm sorry for your childhood troubles, but YTA here.  You are holding a 19 year old to a full grown adults standards.  It sounds like she did the absolute best she could at the time, and being only 19, she probably still had a lot of growing up to do.  It's unfair for you to hold this against her.", "For calling her out, yes YTA. \n\nYou aren\u2019t an AH for being hurt that you never got to grow up in a loving environment. That is a legitimate and painful loss to live with. \n\nThese two things can simultaneously be true - you deserved better as a child but also that your sister isn\u2019t an AH for not being able to provide that.", "YTA\n\nHere are some of the things you wrote in your post. \n\n>My sister taken my brothers and I in when we were just ( 4f 5m 6m) and she was only 19 at the time and did sacrifice alot for us\n\n>My sister at one point in time was working 3 jobs to even be able to provide for us, I never went without food or clothes or even toys.\n\n>my sister was always stressed and irritable,\n\n>My sister is now doing much better in life and no longer have to work and is happily married,\n\nYour sister was still a teen when she took in 3 young children. She made a lot of sacrifices to ensure you had everything you needed. That's a lot of pressure for someone so young. She did her best. \n\nThere is going to be a noticeable difference in how she treats her kid now. She's with a stable partner, is older with more child rearing experience, and no longer has to work multiple jobs just to make sure there's food on the table. \n\nAbsolutely none of this means she didn't love you. She still loves you. What more do you want from her?", "YTA of course. Not because you can't talk about your hardships growing up, but for how you said it and what you said. Ofcourse it's easier for her to be a stable and loving guardian when she has emotional and financial security + several years of growth. Be mindful that she did a lot to give you the best childhood she was able to.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you're so spoiled to have the nerve to write this, is a testament to how good she has been to you. You have absolutely no right to ever complain about anything from her.", "YTA you're brothers are right and your sister did her absolute best in a ridiculously difficult situation. I'm not going to lay on all the reasons because so many people already are doing that in response. \n\nI just suggest you sit down with your brothers and find out why they are upset with you. LISTEN to them, don't interject actually hear what they have to say, because I think it's important for you to hear and truly understand what she did for you and how difficult it must have been for her at that age and at the expense of her own life and future. \n\nThen apologies to her.", "YTA\nYour sister was 19 barely an adult and not that mature and doing the best she could taking care of three kids instead of living it up and being a young adult. She was a single parent, no coparent and working three jobs. There is no surprise she she was probably short with you. And it was NOT your fault that she behaved as she did, but I can\u2019t even imagine myself in her place doing all of that. \nShe\u2019s older, more mature and has a partner so she doesn\u2019t have to work.  \nIf you feel this hurt by everything you need a therapist. I don\u2019t want to invalidate your feelings those are real. It was a hard situation. But clearly this is something you need to work through privately and not yelling at her in front of everyone. \n\nYou should apologize to her and talk through your feelings. It wasn\u2019t fair to her at all.", "YTA. Why don't you try adopting 3 young kids in a couple of years when you're 19 and see how good you are at it?", "YTA. \n\nImagine yourself today on taking on 3 children. She was young and not a parent.  You are lucky you didn't wind up in foster care. You owe her a major apology.", "YTA.  Your sister was a child, only 2 years older than you are now, who took on THREE children.  She had to work, and juggle childrearing, and was not in an emotional or mental state to take all that responsibility on, yet she did.  She is the reason you and your siblings remained together in one home.  She is older and more mature and has learned.  News flash, every parent makes mistakes.  Virtually no 19-year-old would put their future on hold and sacrifice to raise 3 young children that their mother(so she clearly had a poor role model)abandoned.\n\nYou owe your sister one hell of an apology.  If you have anger regarding your childhood, direct it at your mother.  She is the failure, your sister was the hero.", "YTA.  \nSure, she might not have been the greatest for you, but she did everything in her power to keep her siblings together. What you could have had was much, much worse. She has grown, she has had new experiences, you cannot shit on your sister for being a good mother.  \n\n\nWhen she took you and your brothers in, she was not your mother, and she didn't know how to be. All she knew was that she had to take care of you. And taking care of 3 kids at 19? That's INSANE. Give her a break, she did her best!", "YTA. I was in the exact situation your sister was in with 3 siblings when I was 18. Dropped out and worked 3 shitty jobs. She did the best she could with what she had. Your brother is right. Move out.", "YTA.  Your sister made huge sacrifices at a very young to take care of you and your siblings. If she was working 3 jobs in order to support 3 children on her own, she was probably physically and emotionally exhausted, which is why she had much less patience for you than she does with her own child, with whom she is raising with the help of a partner and at a much more mature age.", "YTA\n\nI am so sorry for everything you and your siblings dealt with. But 1000% YTA.\n\nBUT WAIT... You had the audacity to call her out while STILL living with her? Your YTA rating just went up to 20000% YTA\n\nComparing how a 19year old (who had to work 3 jobs and who was most likely not ready to care for 1 let alone 3 children) to how a grown adult is when it comes to caregiving is insane.\n\nYou completely disregarded the sacrifices she had to make to keep your family together AND belittled what she went through while raising you AND 2 other young siblings when she was barely an adult.\n\nYour brothers are completely right to be angry with you. I hope you plan on going above & beyond to apologize to your sister and show your appreciation. If not, I hope you don't plan to CONTINUE to live under her roof because if I were her spouse, you would be out of my house before you finished writing your post.\n\nThe last thing I will say is you're not AH for feeling what you feel. I am sure it is hard to witness this gentleness and patience when you weren't afforded it. Your anger about that is valid, but it isn't your sister's fault. \n\nWould you honestly prefer her to be the same now as she was back then? People grow and learn to process things better and face challenges without letting their emotions go haywire.\n\nImagine if you had to take in 3 children because you are essentially the same age as when she took you in. Seriously ask yourself if you could manage if ON YOUR OWN without any support while working non-stop to provide. \n\n*\\[edited because my web's writing extension messed up the paragraphs\\]*", "YTA. Your 19yo sister took you and your siblings in, working 3 jobs to provide so you didn't materially go without. \n\nAnd far as your comments she was always stressed and irritable, well d'uh, of course she was, she was working 3 jobs whilst raising 3 children. \n\nAnd all this was when she was barely an adult herself. Your sister took you in when mother abandoned you, all **four** of you. Just because she was 19 doesn't mean that your sister didn't need a loving parent too, and it doesn't mean she was emotionally mature enough to be the parent you feel she should have been to you. Do you know what age, on average, women tend to become emotionally mature? 32. That's right about the age she is now.", "Big YTA. Umm, she's not your mother and took on a huge responsibility, one that she didn't have to. Contrary to what you may believe, she actually doesn't owe you anything. Count yourself lucky you had family to provide for you. Try being grateful you didn't end up in foster care.", "YTA Your sister worked three jobs to support you and your two siblings when she was only 19, gave up her childhood sweetheart to be your parent, keeping you out of the foster care system, put her dreams in hold, and made sure you had everything you needed, and now you are almost literally crying over spilt milk? \n\nI can\u2019t believe how ungrateful you are. It sounds like you are jealous of her toddler instead of applauding how your sister has finally gotten in a good place in life, is taking great care her kids, and is continuing to let you live in her comfortable home. You owe her an apology. Do better and honor her sacrifices by giving her your love, appreciation and help around the house.", "idk if I can call you an AH. You're hurt and you've been through a lot in life but so has your sister. Might be good to talk to her and have an open talk and open heart and try to understand each other better. Wish you luck with your family and I hope your pain eases", "NAH, actually. I think you did need to express to your sister how you felt. But you should probably discuss it with her. She deserves a lot of leeway because of how old she was. But you\u2019re allowed to be upset and express that, you deserved gentleness too.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. This situation 100% sucks for everyone involved. She did the best she could. You say you never went without and unfortunately all the work she put in left her with nothing to give you guys emotionally. You were just a child. So was she essentially. With that being said, if you didn\u2019t grow up in a home with empathy, it\u2019s understandable that may not  have much for her now. It\u2019s okay to be upset and voice your pain. Maybe the setting wasn\u2019t right and hopefully you guys can have a conversation later on about you understanding it was hard for her but that you so wish you could have had the gentle side of her. Acknowledge that she worked hard for you and you appreciate it. Hoping for healing for your family.", "I'm sorry that your mother (and father?) abandoned you, and I want to say it's OK to grieve (for a while) for the parents and affection you didn't have, but please do recognise that your sister did her best. \n\nTaking in three young children at 19 - not much older than you are now - is a very big deal, and she gave up a lot to provide for you and keep the family safe and together. If that isn't love, I don't know what is. \n\nNow she's in her 30s, with an established life and a partner to share responsibilities - that's a very different proposition. I understand your pain and sense of loss, I really do, but you owe her an apology. Gentle YTA.", "INFO: What are your plans for next year when you turn 18? Because (as your sister) she didn\u2019t have to take you in when you were 4 and she *certainly* doesn\u2019t have to keep taking care of you once you turn 18 since she is your sister, not your mother. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t wish to stay with her cold and unloving self any longer, so what\u2019s the plan?", "Your sister was 19 when she took in 3 minor children, you are 17 now, so what do you think that looks like? You are only 2 years younger than she was when she got custody of all of you, what do you think your life would look like if you took in 3 kids right now?\n\nYou've been through a lot, and I'm sure your sister wasn't the dream parent, but you are old enough to appreciate what happened to her too, and all that she did to make sure you grew up safe and healthy. She was barely an adult, worked 3 jobs, and sacrificed a lot. \n\nShe is now older, financially stable, and is married. She has a partner and financial security, which means she is less stressed about money, about how to support her children, and has a partner to lean on. You are old enough to imagine what your life would be like at your age with 3 minor children, versus what your life would look like at 30  and deciding to have children, have a partner, and have enough money to do it. \n\nI get that you had a lot to go through on your own, and in a situation like yours, I want to give a soft YTA. But, I have to say, you are 17, and old enough to be able to understand why your sister is a different parent now than 12 years ago, and so it's a full YTA.", "YTA. Your sister was a child raising three children and working three jobs. Yet you *never* went without. My friend, life dealt you all a \\[poopy\\] hand. Your sister appears to have handled everything with as much love and grace as her 19\u2013year\u2013old self could muster. You know what that is? It's love in action. \n\nYou should be thankful your sister didn't leave you and your siblings to be wards of the state.", "Yes. She was exhausted, given way too much responsibility than she could handle as you weren\u2019t even her kids, and she lost her love, her freedom, her youth and her future for you. \n\nYTA.\n\nYou wait until (if) you have kids. You wait until (if) you have kids as a single parent. You wait until (if) you have kids and have to juggle work, house and childcare, maybe as a single parent. You see how calm and reasonable you are then.", "Honestly- it\u2019s very unfair to both of you. It is not her fault though. She kept you guys together, connected as a family rather than a foster home. She did the best she could, based on the age and circumstances. I do understand how it upsets you to see what you missed out on when you were younger, which is something you may have to work through personally. Be happy that she is in a place that she can love and parent comfortably with significantly less stress. You\u2019re mother is the reason you were deprived of a childhood, not your sister.", "YTA. You owe your sister a heartfelt apology. If you don't understand why now, trust me, you will understand why when you are older. What your sister has been able to do is heroic.\n\nHowever: I do understand your feelings of abandonment, loss, and lack of nurturing. I really hope that you will seek therapy, and can come to a place of peace and love for yourself and for your sister.", "She was TWO years older than you are right now and took on caring for you all \u2014 no matter what it cost her. Meanwhile here you are and can\u2019t get over yourself enough to not be jealous of a 2 year old.\n\nI\u2019m sure she did the best she could have. And it probably helps that she has a partner and has evolved as a person.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Of course your sister is a better parent now. She's an adult and has the support of a spouse. She was just a kid when she started raising you.", "You absolutely have a right to be angry that you didn\u2019t get a loving nurturing home environment, but you are mad at the wrong person. Your sister stayed and took you in and did her best to provide what she could. It wasn\u2019t enough, but it also wasn\u2019t her job. It was your parents job. They are the ones that created the terrible situation and they are the ones that deserve your anger. It\u2019s easier to be mad at the people who are nearby. \n\nIt makes sense that you are jealous of your sister\u2019s kid. They have a loving stable home, which you lacked. But again that is on your parents and not your sister. Working 3 jobs as a 19 year old taking care of 3 kids who have undergone trauma (and likely traumatized herself) is very, very different than her current situation. She was basically your age and had probably also never had a loving, stable childhood. \n\nPlease consider apologizing and asking for what you actually need, which is therapy to help you cope with your trauma. All of you probably would benefit from therapy. There was plenty of trauma to go around. Soft YTA.", "She was a kid raising MULTIPLE kids. I couldn't imagine, tbh. I'm sorry that the situation wasn't idea, but YTA. She did a lot better than I could have from the sound of it. If you never wanted for anything, this experience was 100% harder for your sister", "YTA how would you cope if you suddenly had to care for her kids all alone with no other support next year. Put yourself in her shoes. She was an unprepared teen taking care of you as opposed to the adult she is now", "I'd have to say YTA. Your sister made huge sacrifices and uprooted her life for you and you seem ungrateful. Your brother makes a good point- if she was really unloving why are you still living with her? Not trying to excuse her being harsh and cold, but of *course* she's different as an adult in her 30s compared to being an actual teenager. I understand you feel hard done by, but I think the blame here lies on your mother, not your sister. You're blaming the wrong person. Go lecture your mother for your upbringing instead.", "You're not wrong that it's not fair she was a harsh and irritated parent to you. But it's also not fair that she worked 3 jobs and took in 3 very young kids at 19.  \n\nIt's fine and normal to feel upset about what you didn't get out of your childhood. But it's worth considering how much has changed in the ~15 years since then. How much she's learned & grown as a person, and how much less stress she has. Her less than ideal treatment of you was probably the best she could manage at the time. I don't want to label you an AH for not fully recognizing that, though.", "YTA Sister sacrificed everything at the time to provide for you, no wonder she didn't have the bandwidth to provide the emotional environment you would need. That's not her fault.", "I think you might just need some therapy to talk about your problems", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NAH, and here\u2019s why:\n\nYou and all your siblings went through a trauma. Your trauma was being separated from your parents, missing out on the nurturing, loving home every child deserves. Obviously your bio parents couldn\u2019t give that to you, (speaking as someone who was a foster parent) our foster system is so entirely fucked that it was very unlikely the three of you would have been placed in a loving, nurturing, foster/adopt home together. Hell, even being individually placed might not have given you and your siblings that - even with all safeguards in place, abuse in foster homes is rampant. You are (rightfully) pining for something you SHOULD have had, as all children SHOULD have, if we lived in a fair world. You then see your sister giving to her children what you SHOULD have had, and it\u2019s understandable that fills you with rage. It\u2019s not fair that you didn\u2019t get what she is only now able to give. \n\nAt 17, it\u2019s hard to imagine yourself in two years taking on what your sister did - three young children entirely dependent on you, working three jobs, giving up dreams and relationships. Working three jobs alone is exhausting, let alone coming home and taking care of three little ones after, let alone when you are still at an age where your frontal lobe (the thing in your brain that helps control emotions and judgements) won\u2019t fully develop for another five years. Your sister was exhausted, trying to keep it all together, and physiologically not at a point where rational thoughts and emotions were fully developed. Imagine the most exhausting day you\u2019ve ever had, where you slog through the day just dreaming about getting in bed, where you struggle to keep your eyes open, where everything in your body hurts, and coming in to a spilled glass of milk when all you want is to escape. That was likely your sisters every day. Was it fair that she couldn\u2019t keep her emotions in check? No, but I say that it wasn\u2019t fair to you OR her. \n\nNow, your sister is fully developed brain wise. She has a partner who (hopefully) takes on parenting duties as well, someone who she can lean on to be able take over when she needs to escape and rest. She doesn\u2019t work three jobs so she has more energy, and is able to think rationally when the unexpected (spilled glass of milk) happens. She is not consistently exhausted, and is able to actually think through her emotions and actions.\n\nI think you do owe your sister and apology, but I\u2019m going to stick with my judgement, because I agree it wasn\u2019t fair to you (but it also wasn\u2019t fair to her). I think it would be worth going to therapy to work though this, both solo and with your sister.", "soft YTA i think,\n\nyour sister was under an INCREDIBLE amount of pressure . raising three kids would already be hell but at age 19 ? she sacrificed a lot for you guys . its clear shes doing a lot better as a parent now that shes in a better headspace .\n\non the other hand , i do know how awful it feels to have someone yelling at you for every tiny mistake you made . you do have every right to be upset about that , but i think there wouldve been a much better way that you could bring it up without being ungrateful about everything she did for you . this isnt an 'i gave birth to you so worship the ground i walk on situation ' , she took you in as someone who was barely an adult .", "Very soft YTA. You said your sister was 19 and working 3 jobs when she took 3 of you in after petitioning for custody. She obviously was struggling at the time, barely being out of school herself and taking care of 3 very small kids while she was still adjusting to \"adulthood\" and didn't have any guidance. Your brothers are right, she did do the best she could with the resources she had. I imagine in the last 13 years you've been under her care that things have improved, I hope. It definitely is going to hurt that she wasn't kinder and more gentle with you, but you also have to remember she was only 2 years older than you are now. Meaning she's likely 31 or 32 now, correct? Give her some grace, please. I also feel like calling her out in front of other members of the family was extremely unnecessary, and sitting her down to discuss it in private would have been better.", "Wow. At 17 hearing some many say YTA will be harsh. It may be time for some therapy to unpack your feelings and hopefully your sister will join you. You need to take some time and space to gain perspective. Your feelings are valid regarding not feeling nurtured when you were young. That is what the therapy is for. The perspective is writing down the facts of what occurred. A 19-year old starting a life that did not get a chance to begin for her dreams. She CHOSE to care for her siblings who lost any parental support, she lost that support, she lost a long-term relationship because of her dedication to her siblings (You) and ensured you all never went without anything. She worked 3 jobs. I challenge you to go get two jobs while going to school and make sure to fit in babysitting (solo) your two-year old nephew for at least three months. Cut the woman a break and begin work that many of us adults have by nurturing yourself. If you take the challenge then you will find there will not be much time for that either. \n\nSo yes, your sister was possibly short-tempered, possibly resentful at times, and lacked patience. I am 54 and guarantee you if I was doing what she did I would be the same way. It does not take the love and dedication away from you. She showed you mad love, just not in a way you expect. That is the problem though, it is an expectation YOU are placing on someone who did their best with what they had. Placing emotional expectations only creates pain emotionally for you.", "YTA \n\nYour sister who was barely an adult, took 3 little kids in, cared for you, worked her goddamn ass of so you had food and everything and you are angry with her because she is kinda happy now?\n\nI'm sorry that she wasn't that loving to you, I really am but she did something that most people aren't capable of and most children don't have. She fucking deserves some happiness now. I hope you can find that too.", "I see where you are coming from, but YTA. She didn't have to take care of ya'll. She was still a child too, and based on your post she gave up a lot to care for you and really did the best she could. Maybe you felt lonely because your brothers had each other and you just wanted her to be more invested with you cause you're both girls?", "I\u2019m going to say NAH\n\nShe was in a very tough situation having to care for 3 kids at 19 all alone. She was stressed. But she did not handle her stress well, and yelled at children over spilled milk. Walking on eggshells as a child because your caretaker is not coping well is a traumatic way to grow up. You\u2019re still a minor, so now you see her acting all sweet and gentle with her \u201creal kids\u201d and that is hard to see. \n\nYou need therapy. And she needs therapy. And some family sessions with your brothers would be beneficial too.", "Im going with NAH. The Y T A comments are so harsh. OP is 17, op was just 4 years old living in a stressful situation and missed out on a lot on their childhood. The sister is absolutely  goat taking all their siblings in at such a young age but OP getting a little jealous seeing their mother figure (they were 4!!! When their sister took them in) treat her children better can definitely be jarring and bring up a lot of trauma.\n\nOP, reflect on your life and everything your sister did and has done for you, find a good therapist and try to resolve all of the trauma you\u2019ve been through in your life. Bond with your nieces/ nephews and try to be happy with where your family is now.", "NAH. She did the best she could. You were hurt by her actions. Both things can be true.", "YTA, she paused her life sacrificed a lot for you siblings. She probably wasn't even prepared to be a mother let alone 3. She did the best she could with what she was capable of.\n\nOver time she has grown as a person and like you said in a better place. I can't imagine working 3 jobs looking after 3 young ones and being completely mellow.\n\nYou should be extra grateful and appreciative of what she's done for you, she's 1 in a million even with her faults, who else was willing to take you in?", "YTA - she was still a kid herself when she took on the responsibility to look after you and your brothers. You should be proud of her and how she is trying to do better now with her children", "YTA.  She gave up her young adulthood to provide you a stable home, food, and toys.  Yes, she was irritable; yes, she was impatient.  She was a kid herself and it wasn't her responsibility to raise you guys.  If she didn't love you, she wouldn't.  She was running herself ragged and she didn't have the ability or bandwidth to be patient.  Now that she has support, now that she's not working 3 jobs trying to keep 3 kids alive - she has the luxury of being patient and creating a nurturing environment.  You can't compare her as a girl of 19 with the world on her shoulders to the woman of 32 she is today.", "Your sister\u2019s parenting doesn\u2019t sound ideal, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. She was barely an adult and had three children to look after. You should be grateful YTA", "OP you are feeling like this is because your sister is likely the only stable parent you knew. She is a better mum to her daughter then she was to you. Its ok to feel that.\n\nBut your sister wasn't thinking this. You weren't her kid but her sibling. Its a different type of love.\n\nMy sister and I have a 9 year difference. I have changed that girl's diapers and taken care of her extensively. I can easily die for her. That said we fight, we argue, I resented her a lot of times when I was young and so on. We were passengers on the same boat and sometimes the journey was rough.\n\nMy feeling for my kid is different. Its a different dynamic. I will kill for my child. I'm the boat. Its my job to protect hi from the world. We are not responsible for each other-Only I am responsible.\n\nYour sister probably feels the same way. You were all in a shitty situation together and working like a family. She sees you like a sibling. She relied on you as much as you relied on her. And this may have come in negative ways such as her snapping at you when she was stressed. You were in it together.\n\nShe can't rely on her kid. She is calmer because she has to regulate herself. Her kid isn't her equal however you were and are.\n\nI think you both love each other very much but in very different roles and this is causing a conflict. I think you should go to therapy  and unknot what you are feeling. NAH", "NAH. I cannot hold against your sister what she did when she was clearly under heavy strain, even though some would call it verbal abuse. But it seems like she was doing the best she could with a bad hand.  And I cannot really fault you for feeling jealous at seeing your niece getting what you always wanted.  Maybe you could have kept from saying anything, but sometimes things like this come out when it gets to be just too much. My advice would be to sit down with your sister and share all the reasons you are grateful to her, all the good things she has done, and apologize for making her feel so bad. You don\u2019t have to pretend those other feelings are not there or true for you, but try to focus on the better things. If nothing else, by taking you in, she prevented the three of you from being split up, which is very common.  I am sure you can think of other positives.", "YTA - your sister is a living saint and you\u2019re an insufferable fool who doesn\u2019t realize how delusional you sound.  I hope she kicks you out as you don\u2019t deserve her continued kindness", "A very soft YTA. \n\nYou are right. It sucks not feeling nurtured in a way you thought you should have as a kid. You're 17 or 18. How mature and capable do you think you could handle 3 kids barely school-aged?  With no or too little support.\n\nYes, she was harsh and should have done better. All new parents messed things up, but this was a sister. She loved you enough not to put you into foster. It would have been worse for you there. OR do you think that would have been better? \n\nCut her some slack. she learned a great deal with you and your siblings. Now learn from her on what not to do and what she is doing now.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through that, I\u2019ve witnessed a similar situation. It\u2019s a lot to take on at 19, your sister could of easily put you guys in foster care, but she didn\u2019t. \n\nShe chose to take on that responsibility and the role of the mother at a young age without any experience, guidance or help.\n\nShe worked 3 jobs to provide for you to make sure you never went without, while she missed out on college and important milestones. \nSo you can imagine why she was short tempered with you, it\u2019s a lot and not easy looking after 3 young kids that you had no intention of looking after. \n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from with wanting to be nurtured and loved, but for the sake of your mental wellbeing please seek out therapy. You need someone to vent to, your sister isn\u2019t that person anymore, and you need to talk to a professional.", "YTA\n\nShe took on the responsibility of raising children when she was barely even an adult herself. \nInstead of being grateful for all she's done with the very little tools she had you bash her.", "Wow! YTA! What an ungrateful sister you are.\nYou should realize how your sister work hard for you and your brother. \nAnd honestly, it's not her responsibility, she can easily choose the easy way out, to leave you. But she chose the hard way, took care of you.", "YTA - She was young and working 3 jobs to support herself and 3 siblings. She had to have been STRESSED beyond belief. Be thankful that you will never have to deal with or handle the stress that she had to at such a young age. I mean what was a little spilled milk to you was an extra hour she may have had to work to rebuy that said milk. She has now had more than a decade to grow as a person and caregiver, so I'm sure she is more patient. Also she is a lot less stressed with less responsibility and is now in a better place financially, so she has a lot less to worry about. She did something that a lot of people wouldn't do for their siblings, but instead of being grateful you basically went and spit in her face. I think you should apologize.", "YTA and a brat, of course she can handle\nHerself better now as an adult with a child she chose to make instead of as a teenager with three children that shouldn\u2019t have been her responsibility.", "YTA for talking to such a HORRIBLE person who mistreated you so much by...taking care of you and your siblings when no one else stepped up to do what's right  by you. /s", "Your sister.was 19 when she took you in. What would your life be like if you had 3 young children dropped on you now? Do you think you might be stressed? Worried about money? Apologize to your sister.

She gave up everything - her partner, education prospects, etc - to support her siblings, working a horrific amount to keep you happy and provided for... and youre sulking because you dont think the environment was supportive enough and she got mad when you broke stuff\n\nShe was under a horrific amount of stress for someone her age. Does that mean your feelings arent valid? Of course not. Id suggest working through it all with a therapist, and I hope your sister can get the same. But to publicly tear into her for zero reason other than youre mad she now lives in a far less stressful, supportive environment, and so can create a better environment for her kids? That wasnt fair.", "YTA. When your sister was not much older than you she became a parent to 3 children she never planned on. How would you handle it? Would you be a bit cross and stressed or would you be totally relaxed and fine?\n\nWhile you probably didn\u2019t have a great childhood, you really can not resent your sister who, before being able to drink in certain countries, took on her mother\u2019s/father\u2019s responsibilities and did her very best.", "YTA. 19 year olds are generally not prepared to be the sole, full time parent, of three young children. That\u2019s why she may not have had the emotional tools to do everything perfectly. She worked three jobs, lost her relationship, her entire life plan was derailed. Surely you can understand how that makes it hard to be emotionally strong and at your best. \n\nYour childhood could have been better. But obviously her 20\u2019s could have too. She took lemons and tried to make lemonade. You are coming across as ungrateful honestly.", "YTA, big time.  Do you realize that you stole the best years of your sister\u2019s life?  Back off you entitled brat.", "YTA. Can you imagine being 19 years old, never living out your 20s as the average person does, giving up all your dreams, working three whole jobs to take care of three little kids? She put her entire life on hold for you and your siblings when she did not have to and you\u2019re still ungrateful. Would you have rather been thrown in foster care, possibly being abused and never seeing your siblings again?

You\u2019re a brat.", "A lot of comments are calling you out OP and like don\u2019t think they\u2019re not justified, I can be a little more sympathetic to how you\u2019re feeling. My mother had me when she was 19, and then had the rest of my siblings after I had turned 11. I noticed that the way she parented me was much different than the way she parented my siblings, and I began to resent her for that. She was a lot harder on me, and that definitely continues to have an impact on our relationship. It took time for me to realize that she was a different person when she raised me, compared to now as she\u2019s raising my siblings. People change a lot, especially as they grow and mature from their teens into their twenties and thirties. As you are only 17 right now, you probably don\u2019t understand this personally, but give it some time and revisit this in 10 years or so. I think your perspective will change immensely. You cannot hold your sisters age against her; it\u2019s not a fair comparison because things were different and she was different. I understand that is frustrating and is not fair to you to have been on the receiving end of this all, but it\u2019s also not fair to hold that against your sister. Soft YTA", "YTA\u2026she was a child herself and sacrificed a lot to raise and ungrateful brat. She could\u2019ve let you go into the system but didn\u2019t and now that she\u2019s grown, matured and a loving mother, you feel she owes you something when in actuality, you owe her more than just a thank you and criticism.", "YTA- And I say this gently, because I know what it\u2019s like to see someone treat another person better than they treated you. But it had to be a LOT for a teenager to take in 3 small kids. She did that out of love. She does love you! You\u2019re not an AH for feeling cheated out of the best side of your sister. You\u2019re an AH for how you called her out in front of everyone, instead of having a private talk, using gentler words. She\u2019s all grown now, and has an easier life than she did when you were small. Of course she can offer her best side. She isn\u2019t struggling or under non stop stress.", "Yta she had a lot of responsibility at such a young age and she did her best to provide for you and your siblings. If she had 3 jobs she was probably exhausted and tired and stressed managing her jobs and taking care of you guys. You should be more kind to her and thankful.", "YTA. So your young 19 year old sister suddenly came a parent of three; had to work three jobs, lost her boyfriend because she stood by you three. Your mad that with a partner and no over worked and much more experienced in parenting; she\u2019s a better parent.\n\nHonestly ask older siblings; many will tell you about how unfair they had it in comparison to younger siblings; less strict etc; because parents learned from their mistakes", "YTA. You deserved a better childhood but so did your sister. She was a teenager when she had to deal with the loss of your parents and looking after 3 little kids. She did her best and you need to acknowledge that.", "YTA. She was barely older than a child herself looking after you. The bond she feels with her own is different.

Learn some empathy.", "YTA and it\u2019s astonishing that you need to be told this.", "Yta! Her life was turned upside down when she had to take you guys in.

Your words were not. And if you have that open and honest conversation with her, I hope she listens and hears you.

She was shocked to hear me say that and started crying saying she did her best with what she had. \n\nMy brothers surprisingly stood up for her and told me that If she that bad then why am I still living with her and that she was amazing caretaker and took us when our own mother abandoned us so how could I be so selfish and accused her of any less.\n\nIt got really contentious so my sister ended up excusing herself to her room but in the end my brother whom I'm really close too are angry with me. \n\nSo now I'm here wondering if I was wrong for  calling my sister out.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How grateful I am that she went through all that without ever letting us go without, go hungry, and not feel resentment towards us\u201d\n\nUnbelievably entitled and ungrateful move to make her feel awful for something like this.  Just\u2026 wow.", "YTA. You\u2019re not her child. \n\nAs tough as it is to understand, she didn\u2019t have a choice with all of you.

Look, your feelings are valid. But she sacrificed a hell of a lot to care for you and your siblings.

She could have let you and your siblings go into foster care, but she kept all of you guys together.

You should direct your anger at your birth mom who abandoned you, not your sis who decided to step up and give up her life just for you three.", "Initially I was going to say this is a hard Y T A.  Your sisters sacrifice for you and your brothers is such an act of love. She really is a hero who kept the family together. Truly moving. I thought how can you treat her so terribly and be anything but grateful....but I really can\u2019t imagine being abandoned by both my parents as a child and being raised by my teenage sister who must have been hanging on by the skin of her teeth.  I imagine when you see your sister with her child it must be painful.  Maybe instead of actually being mad at your sister, what makes you so upset is you didnt receive this level of care and love from your mom. You were cheated big time; all of you were. You need to apologize to her and tell her:  as amazing as she was and how grateful you are to her for saving your family, it still hurts you got cheated out of having a loving mother.", "YTA. Your sister dropped everything at 19 to care for her 3 younger siblings, she worked 3 jobs to make ends meet, she was a child raising children. She's now in a marriage, older, settled, less financially stretched, of course she's going to be a little more patient.", "YTA. A selfish AH.", "You\u2019re two years away from the age she adopted you never mind the fact that she was probably already taking care of you at the age you are now- You don\u2019t have the capacity to treat Her with kindness understanding and compassion but you think that you would be able to do that to 3 children with 3 jobs? Lol ok", "Gentle YTA\n\nI can see where you are coming from. Obviously you have had a rough start to life and remember how stressful your sister was trying to raise you and your siblings.\n\nBut there's two points you need to consider here. The first is that you want your sister to apply the same way she used to deal with you as a child spilling a glass of milk that she does for her toddler. It's not the same. A child can understand more of the waste of milk than a toddler can. I have three years between my children, and I expect more from the elder than the younger.\n\nThe second point is that people change. Circumstances change. Your sister is now happily married and that spilled glass of milk isn't going to mean the difference it did back then.\n\nMy own family has some large age gaps, and I've seen it happen with my siblings. I've made peace with it, because the only other option is to cut off all contact with them.", "YTA she was a child raising children. You are old enough to realize that now. She had no clue what she was doing she did do the best she could she provided everything you needed right? You should be happy that she's grown evolved matured enough to be even better to her kids now. You should be happy that she's found some kind of piece after all she gave up for you. Instead you want to pick and fight and act like jealous of a 2 year old? What was your end game to get her to be mean to her kids?", "Wow op. Your sister was only two yrs older than you are now when she took you all in. Lost her boyfriend, worked three jobs to keep you all together etc. it\u2019s ok to feel a loss for the childhood you never had; but to blame your sister who was still a kid herself is just shameful.", "YTA. I can't even. Be grateful. She didn't have to apply for custody and you could have been sent to an orphanage.", "YTA, but only for \"calling her out\".\n\nPart of growing up is realizing that no one -- not even adults -- are perfect. Your sister is right; she did what she could with what she had, and you're doing the same.\n\nYou are absolutely valid to feel hurt and angry, OP, but you don't need to direct it at her. Anger is the part of you that speaks up when you've been wronged, and that's the thing, you *were* wronged. You did not deserve your parents' abandonment, the very thing that landed you in the care of a barely-adult in the first place. No child deserves that, but that doesn't mean that she deserves your anger or resentment. It's quite possible she *also* has resentment at the situation and how rough it was on her -- it seems that she has resolved to do better and be better in the future to these children than she was to all of you. It's not much of a solace, I know, when the hurt is still there. But I know that if you consider the possible alternative (that your sister kept her resentment and continued to be cold and angry to her own children) you'll realize that you'd rather she be gentle now.\n\nThe past can't change once it's happened, but you can pursue some therapy for yourself and do some healing, OP.", "You are currently only two years younger than your sister was when she took on three - THREE! Young children. Can you imagine being solely responsible for kids? Would you maybe be stressed the fuck out and snappy sometimes? She did her best while basically still a child. She is now an adult with ONE small child with the resources and support in the form of a spouse to care for kids. Of course she has grown up and is different now. You need to let this go, and also, yeah YTA.\n\nHell, I am 35, with one job and a whole spouse, and only have TWO small kids, and I am stressed AF. Your sister made it through and raised you. Be grateful for that.", "Nah. Your sister at 19 is a different person from the person she is now. I totally understand how you feel but based on what you wrote she was put in an impossible situation and did the best she could while being a kid herself. Cut her some slack and thank her for all that she's done.", "Are you serious?

Apologize immediately.", "YTA\n\nMaybe she could have been nicer but a 19 yr old took in 3  kids not even in kindergarten and raised them so they never had material needs. Without her, you would have been split up from your siblings and lost in the foster system. So, yes, she was stressed. And now, as a married mom in her 30s with a support system, she is calmer. Maybe stop being selfish and just be happy that her kids will have a better childhood than all of you", "Your sister sacrificed for you, to keep you out of foster care. Yes, you can be angry at not getting the childhood every kid deserves. Yes, you can be angry that your mother left you and your siblings. \n\nBut don\u2019t be angry when the person who raised you (and who fought and put her life on hold to do so) didn\u2019t do a perfect job *when she was 19*.

The person you *should* be angry at, and call out, is your mother.", "**Edited:** I change my vote.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in your feelings because you see a major difference in the way your sister\u2019s children are treated and the way that you were raised.\n\nBut remember, she was only 19, and she wasn\u2019t experienced at parenting. You have to give her some credit because at least she actually tried.\n\nWith that said\u2026\n\nYour feelings are valid, but you should appreciate your sister for the things she did for you.\n\nYTA.", "NAH it\u2019s commendable that your sister, at 19, volunteered to parent her three young siblings. It is not your fault or hers that she was faced with that situation, or that she didn\u2019t have much support financially or emotionally. You acknowledge that your sister was devoted and made many sacrifices, but was also cold and critical. We can\u2019t know whether your childhood might have been better with a different caregiver. But it is desperately unfair for others to say that you need to be unconditionally, eternally grateful simply because she chose to take on the responsibility of you. As any child does, you deserved to feel wanted in a loving and supportive home. Your sister seems to have tried her best, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to pretend everything was always perfect. \n\nWith all that said, calling someone out is rarely a path to resolution or understanding.    It would be healthier for you to work through your own feelings with a therapist than to try to get validation from your sister.", "Should have treated you worse. Maybe you'd be traumatized enough to be grateful.", "YTA, be a bit more grateful and understanding.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t voluntarily become a parent to three kids at 19 and it sounds like she did the best she could. Do you want her to be snappy with her kid now to make it fair?", "YTA. Your sister loves you so much. Even when you confronted her, she felt terrible. You have to realize that a 19 year old taking on 3 siblings is a life changing event for her. She went from no responsibility to now responsible for 3 kids. Her long term relationship ended. She put her own life aside for you to be able to provide for all 3 of you. One person supporting 3 kids is a lot! You even talked about her being stressed and irritable. It all comes from stress. She worked multiple jobs. You know what ppl do at her age, they party, have fun, go out on dates, travel, do stuff for themselves (just like you will be able to do when you turn 19 because your sister put your needs before hers).\n\nNow she is in a better place. She is financially well, she is a lot older, she no longer has to do it on her own. I'm going to say that since you are only 17, maybe you don't have enough life experience to begin to understand everything your sister sacrificed for you, so some advice. Apologize and apologize hard. She gave up everything for you 3, you need to let her know you acknowledge that and you are grateful for it.", "Didnt get past the first sentence. YTA", "YTA. Wow\u2026 you are an ungrateful brat. Of course your sister was stressed out, she was barely a legal adult herself.", "She didn't want to be a mother at 19. She chose to give up her dream to raise her siblings. She chose to keep you. She is your sister. You are 17 and this is how you act? I hope you are a troll. This is disgusting. YTA you would be a very different person right now with a very different out look on life if your sister didn't step up as a child herself and give up everything she wanted to raise you, if you grew up in the foster care system. Can you imagine where you would be right now without her? She wasn't loving enough but worked 3 jobs to make sure you had food, SAFE housing, cloths and stuff you wanted but it's not good enough. She should have gave more of herself to you. Did you ever think maybe she felt the same way you did? Like it's not good enough and SHE wasn't loved? My God you are so selfish. I hope she just learned what kind of person you really are. Because you definitely showed the whole family. Me me me", "YTA and a complete brat. She was 19 taking in 3 very young kids doing the best she could with little to no support from anyone else. She gave up her youth to raise you guys.

If you had to work three jobs and still couldn't make ends meet with no education to be able to better yourself.\n\nShe did not have to do that. She chose to do it and her life wasn't that great because of it. Because she sacrificed herself for you \n\nCould you do it and always be perfect?\n\nYour lack of respect and empathy is profound. Very very profound. Your lack of gratitude is appalling. The pain you choose to inflict in the face of her generosity is a major slap in the face.\n\nI am sure she is crying in her room. Your relationship has forever changed and that is on you and your self centered viewpoint", "YTA. Your sister literally chose her siblings, including YOU, over herself in every aspect. With my first I was a single mom. It\u2019s ALOT. Working multiple jobs to keep the lights on and food on the table to come home to more work. It\u2019s just a lot. She didn\u2019t HAVE to do that because y\u2019all weren\u2019t her children, she chose to which says a lot. So I say it\u2019s to be expected that she was grumpy sometimes since she was exhausted and overwhelmed.\n\nShe is now married and has someone to help carry the load. I had my second when I remarried and having another person there makes a big difference. She probably finally has a chance to breathe and doesn\u2019t feel like she is going to snap at any given moment which does give her more patience. \n\nYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t end up in foster care because most likely all of you would have been separated and a lot of the time foster life is far worse than someone getting upset about something breaking.

But thoughts like that only do you more harm than good. Your sister surely had your best interest in mind and was also still growing and maturing at the time in which she took you in. Having so much life experience from such a young age has given her the ability to be better for her kids now and though it\u2019s bittersweet, she has you and your brothers to thank for that.

She obviously cannot be the same parent she was, she had several years to learn, and clearly has a less stressful life (from 3 jobs raising 3 kids at 19 to being able to be a SAHM).\n\nShe did the best she could. Parenting is damn hard even for more experienced adults in a good financial shape.\n\nYou should apologize to her.\n\nYTA", "Yes, YTA. BUT, your feelings are also valid. What everyone else has pointed out is absolutely true. She did give up basically her whole life at 19 to take care of you. Yes, that was obviously not a burden she was prepared for and she did the best she could. However, everyone here seems to be forgetting you are also not grown and cannot be expected to have the tools to deal with this either. You grew up in a harsh and stressful environment and are the product of that. Your frustration and jealousy are understandable and normal. The question is how do you move forward? A therapist would be much better equipped to help you put everything into perspective and work through your feelings in a productive manner than a bunch of strangers on the internet. I hope you and your sister can get to a place where you can both see each other's perspective and work through this.", "You\u2019re an awful sister.

Worked at times 4 different jobs, at the same time.  She was probably stressing out to no end, worrying about things that no 19 yo should be worrying about, made sure that you and your siblings had everything you needed to grow up.

Would mental and emotional abuse, even physical abuse been more to your liking?

Nobody likes to be angry or hateful to their loved ones. Have you ever spoken to her before? Face to face? Alone? Have you ever reached out to her and told her how you felt? Now that you are around her age, how would you feel if that happened to you? Your sister even CHANGED her behaviour and parenting style. That\u2019s great for her!

You are very blessed to have had a sister willing to give so much to you. Your sister kept your siblings together. Now you go and complain about how a 19 year old who worked her ass off got stressed when she had to come home to do more work cleaning up after kids that are not even hers.

It makes sense that you're envious of your niblings. It's good that your sister is doing so much better though, and it can still hurt that you didn't have such a childhood. This is all just heartbreaking. Your sister did her best. Your best at 19 is nowhere near your best at 31.

People who don't cry over spilt milk can easily replace it. 19 year olds with three jobs prob do have to struggle to replace spilt milk.

And every drop of spilt milk or broken glass is another 5, 10, 30 minutes that you are going to have to work to replace it, all while you are barely taking care of your own health and go to bed hungry.

It can be hard to watch sometimes because they have all this wild, messy fun and she lets them be kids. She plays with them all the time and brings them treats to school almost every day. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to not feel like I missed out on actually getting to be a kid and having a fun mom who played with them. I\u2019ve spent a few adult years in therapy unpacking it, but I also learned to give my mother some grace and patience, though it\u2019s not always easy. \n\nShe definitely didn\u2019t have it easy and did the best she could with what she had at the time. Things were different back then too. There\u2019s a lot more resources and online communities to turn to now. I mean, is anybody knocking the parenting thing out of the park the first time? You pretty much just do your best and hope your kids come out of it with the least amount of issues.\n\nShe says now that she\u2019s a better grandma than she was a mom. But even my sibling had very different treatment as a kid (and still now) than I did. So it\u2019s hard to not hold onto that anger. I\u2019m sympathetic to OP, but she\u2019s still young.

It's probably worth talking to her about and understanding her perspective.", "Extra cruel, because I have no doubt that someone who would give up the end of their childhood/early adult years to care for three siblings already feels guilty for every time she was short-tempered. She sacrificed so much and accomplished so much, but now she must feel like a failure. I'm glad she is able to enjoy motherhood now with less stress and anxiety. \n\nShe was just two years older than OP when she took on the responsibility of three very young children. OP needs to reflect on how ready she would be to handle that kind of pressure. There's really not that much difference between 17 and 19 when it comes to something like this. \n\nThe past is over. You can't change it. The substitute parent relationship needs to be set aside and they need to work on just being sisters.

I\u2019m glad you are going to make it up to your sister, and I hope you can work through those feelings somehow.", "It sounds like you have a lot of very reasonable grief to process about the way your childhood went. It\u2019s okay to be hurt by your sister\u2019s parenting style when you were younger. It\u2019s okay to be mad that you were treated in a way that made you feel unloved. The work you need to do now is unpacking all of that and learning how to love the woman who sacrificed so much for you, while acknowledging her basic humanity, fallibility, and struggle. You\u2019ve got some deep wounds around attachment and it is some serious work to fix that\u2014but there\u2019s almost nothing more worthwhile to do. Processing the grief of your childhood will allow you to be a better adult, and have a better relationship with your sister. \n\nThink about it this way\u2014when you see how she is with her child, and you think of how different it is from how she raised you, imagine how much pain that must cause her. The way she acts now is the way she believes ALL children should be parented, and she COULD NOT GIVE THAT to you. I suspect she is probably burdened by a deep, painful sense of guilt and failure over how you were raised, because she simply couldn\u2019t provide for you in ALL the ways she wanted to. Even if she was older, more mature, if you\u2019re working crazy hours for basic survival, stressing every moment of every day about how you\u2019re gonna keep food on the table and pay the bills, you simply *cannot* be as emotionally available as you would if you weren\u2019t so busy, sleep deprived, and stressed. \n\nSo again, when you see her parenting her children, assume that\u2019s what she wanted for you, and what she would have given you if she could.

Your childhood wasn\u2019t perfect through no fault of your own. But you\u2019re almost an adult, you can\u2019t push the blame around like this. You should apologize to your sister, tell her you recognize she did the best she could in a shitty situation and ask her to help you find a therapist.

OP ending her post by saying \"I'm just wondering if I'm wrong for calling my sister out\" also makes it seem like she's COMPLETELY oblivious to the real issue with what she said/did. To me it reads like, \"They shouldn't be mad at me for saying it like it is!\" \n\nI can understand being jealous that her sister's new kids are having such a very different experience, but it's not her sister's fault. It's an entirely different situation that those kids were brought into.

Her sister is clearly being hard enough on herself, she doesn't need OP to make all of her (endless) sacrifices seem like it wasn't enough. \n\nI just hope posting this, and reading the onslaught of YTAs, ends up being the wake-up call she needs to realize how extremely fortunate she is to have that amazing woman as her sister.", "She yelled at a small child over literal spilled milk.", "Um, no.

Sister is clearly with a partner that she loves and is happy with now.", "Wow", "I would rather have someone who truly loved me", "Absolutely i wouldn't either. She done something monumental, it truly is huge. But i do think you're allowed to be upset if your parents were in shit circumstances like poverty or had kids young and they berated you and it affected you.

Rather then saying they don't owe their children anything", "I also wonder how much bad the yelling or scolding.

I know some children that will get upset even at a firm tone but no raised voice or extended lecture", "You labeled a kid raising her siblings, trying her absolute best with little to no support, as an abuser. Showing moments of frustration is not abuse. OP can feel the way she feels, I'm not saying that. I am saying that her sister is amazing for what she did, and most people wouldn't be able to do it.

She wanted you.", "do you not realize that none of this is your sister\u2019s fault?\n\nit\u2019s your parents who abandoned ALL OF YOU and then put your oldest sister in a situation where she had to deal with that and becoming a parent to three children. \n\nI am sorry it was difficult and also do you really not understand that going into foster care wouldn\u2019t have guaranteed you a placement with someone \u201cwho truly loved you.\u201d are you really not able to have empathy for your sister who was just two years older than you are now when she assumed responsibility for your care?\n\nI am sorry that you didn\u2019t feel wanted as a kid\u2026and also, I hope you are able to realize that was your parents\u2019 responsibility. not your sister\u2019s. \nif she did not want you, she wouldn\u2019t have blown up her entire life to keep you.", "Dude she was a kid too thrust into a horrible situation. Grow up, you have no idea what she went through and I\u2019m surprised her husband didn\u2019t react in a very strong way.", "Nothing that you\u2019ve said suggests she hates you at all. It sounds like she was basically a kid who unexpectedly took on a role that would overwhelm a 45 year old and did her best\u2014because she loved you. Her best might not have been very good at the time (I know that I would have been an absolute disaster of a parent if I had to raise kids in my late teens/early twenties, no matter how much I loved them and how good my intent was\u2014I just was not mature enough to do a good job at that age), and what you\u2019re probably seeing now is that her \u201cbest\u201d as a parental figure is better now because shes older/wiser/more stable/more experienced.\n\nHonestly it sounds like she loves you very very much. I can totally believe she wasn\u2019t a great parental figure but that\u2019s because of the circumstances, and not about how she feels about you/your siblings.", "You keep saying \"she hated us\" as if that was true. It makes it a lot easier for you to believe your own line of reasoning that way.", "I mean, yeah? Of course she would have had a better life if she could have at least had the chance to follow her dreams. You'll get chances she had to give up *because she loved you*, you holding that against her and trying to make her feel bad for finally being able to carve out a bit of happiness is just cruel.", "I can't believe how much worse your responses have gotten over the original post...which made you out to be horrible.\n\nYou are now looking even worse.", "She was a child who was forced to become a mother to 3 young children. She had to work 3 jobs to make sure you had enough. She did all of that because she loved you, she put herself through all that because she wanted to hold the family together. Look, I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get the childhood you wanted, but you are not being at all fair to her.", "She took you in because she loves you. She gave up her dreams because she loves you. She gave you the best life she could, because she loves you. \n\nAnd in return, you broke her heart.", "This feeling 'she don't love you' is due to the abandonment of your parents and most likely hearing from adults that you were a burden.  \n\nBut to be honest, in the eyes of others, you were a burden to her.  Why?  Simple, taking care of a child is the obligation of the parents, not of the siblings.  So there is a possibility that she considered them a burden, which must have been very frustrating for her as she had to fight herself for thinking that way.  The result of that fight is the way she cares for her children.  That is, not repeat the mistakes she made with you. \n\n You should work on that feeling of abandonment because it could bring you problems in the future. And also apologize to your sister, because she did more than her responsability.\n\n I suggest you talk to her, maybe, to get an apology just to close that cycle of trauma.", "youre an ungrateful brat. if she didnt think you were a burden then, youre definitely acting like one now. im so angry for your sister. she deserves better than you. complaining that someone took care of you even though it wasnt her responsibility? should have just put you in foster care and become a doctor instead of dealing with your bullshit. \n\nshe cant even enjoy the motherhood she choose because you wont let her. you seriously suck", "What you're feeling is valid, but you can't make assumptions because it will only cause more pain for everyone involved. Trust me.. it really doesn\u2019t help and it makes it harder for you to process what you need to. \n\nI know how much it sucks to witness a parent give another kid something they never gave you. That anger is one that will grow and grow and grow if you let it. It was the hardest thing I had to process, and it took forever for me to overcome/let go of that anger.  *It was the hardest but the best thing I learned how to do. It will take time so don't rush yourself.*   \nHypothetically: let's say she was angry about having to give up becoming a doctor, but that wouldn't mean that anger is directed at you. she could be sad about taking another path in life, but that doesn't mean you weren't worth giving up her original plan. It may seem that way because of the situation, and it's easy to assume the worst. ESPECIALLY if you're gonna compare the then vs now.   \nI'm sure if she could travel back in time, she would have raised you using the parenting practices she's using now. Especially if it was her raising 3 without  help while working 3 jobs. Hindsight is always 20/20. It is easy to point out every mistake when you\u2019re able to take a step back & look at the big picture.   \nI\u2019m not sure if this is something you\u2019re into but write out what you\u2019re feeling. During the entire time that I was processing emotions related to my upbringing, I would write a letter to that person OR I would write a letter to myself when I was younger. Just get it all out. Depending on what mood I was in I would either keep the letter somewhere safe or I would rip it up & burn it \u2026. okay there is a chance that I misplaced the letter and just claimed that I kept it somewhere safe. But you get it.", "Hey so my parents had me as teenagers and definitely were not ready for a kid (and later kids with the birth of my brother) at that time and later they divorced/had other kids. What I'm trying to say is that I somewhat identify with the feelings you're going through. Watching my siblings that are 10yrs younger than me have a totally different life than me can be hard and I've definitely had complicated feelings about my parents having to 'give up their lives/ambitions/dreams for me' and not being as emotionally mature when I was a kid vs now. \n\nHaving complicated feelings in this situation is normal. However you don't have to hate yourself for existing. What you wrote out sounds a lot like the internal self talk I'd have surrounding my relationship with my parents. I really recommend you seek whatever help is accessible to you. Whether it's therapy or journaling or telling your brothers you feel guilty for existing because that's what your statement sounds like you're trying to say to me. I used to lash out a lot because I felt guilty/hated myself for existing. Usually at my parents because in my mind they could've just decided to not keep me (similar to how you've said she could've not kept you and your brothers). It took me a long time to learn this and I hope it doesn't take you as long as it's taken me but: you don't have to feel guilty/hate yourself for existing", "Are you still in school? Do they have therapy services? I think you should talk to someone about how you feel.", "Of course she would have preferred not to give up her entire life at 19.  She's human.  That doesn't mean she didn't love you.  She loved you so much that she pretty much threw her life in the toilet so you weren't in an even worse situation.", "Works you be ready in two years to give up everything and work yourself to death to raise three kids? \n\nShe didn't hate you, she just had literally nothing left to give.\n\nShe loved you enough to give up literally everything to keep you together and well cared for. \n\nMaybe look into therapy to work through these feelings. 17 is old enough to understand what an incredible thing she did for you, when she herself was so young", "I don\u2019t think you meant to be TA, you were but I really don\u2019t think that was your intent I understand that you dealing with some pretty huge emotions (that will always happen when parents abandon their children) but try to put yourself in your sister\u2019s shoes for a moment , she was 19, you said that you are 17 do you think that you could do the same in 2 years from now? Give up your life, education, relationship everything for children who need you? While dealing with the same abandonment as you. Edit spelling", "There's no guessing here. If your sister remotely hated you.. your memories would be with some foster family. No memories of her working THREE jobs to support you FFS.\n\nThe fact that you're ASSUMING she hated you doesn't even logically compute because she could have abandoned you, but she didn't. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH", "I'm going to be gentle because I feel everyone is being super harsh. I feel like this can be talked out and they can see each other sides. \n\nMaybe you should have a talk with your sister. Sit down and tell her that you are grateful that she took you in, that she gave up so much for you. Just explain why you feel the way you feel. And apologize for upsetting her. \n\nI feel like there's just a lot of stuff going on. All of you lost your parents pretty young so there was/is a layer of grief or abandonment (I didn't see any info on the parents) on top of all of this. I don't think either of them are wrong.", "OP, there's a difference between her hating you, and her hating the stresses and burdens she took on at an early age. She was barely older than you are now. \n\nWhen you get older, you realize a lot of life is making space for all different truths, and knowing that they all can exist simultaneously - even if they seem contradictory. Your sister can still love you, and you can still feel unloved. Both of these can be true, as you wanted more than your sister could provide, even when she provided out of love.\n\nGive her a hug, and say sorry. Also try to look into counselling through your school if possible as most humans struggle with not feeling loved, and counselling can help us recognize and accept the love that is around us.", "She was a teenager who gave up her whole life, and yet she never abandoned you.\nIf she truly hated you you wouldn't be with her at 18.\nHave a little compassion for your sister.", "Please get therapy to sort through this!! Calling her out isn't going to heal you", "In two years when you are her age, see if you would take on three jobs and three kids out of nowhere. From your current maturity level, I would say it\u2019s not even possible", "I am glad that you realize what she has done for you. I hope you realize that you are acting this way because you're jealous that your mother didn't treat you the way she is treating her kids, and then ask your sister to help you find a therapist that can help you work out your issues.", "You should give you sister a huge apology. She is more loving with her child because that is her child. She wanted that child. She was forced to grow up early and take on a lot of responsibility at a young age. That is why you are seeing a difference.", "I\u2019m glad you realize this.\n\nLove comes in MANY shapes and sizes. Your sister loves you. She kept you all with her. She did everything she could to provide for you. She absolutely sacrificed for you all, and it\u2019s 1000000% appropriate for her to have trauma from what she gave up. But she STILL chose you all! THAT is love!!!\nShe loved you with the ability she had at that time. And she loves you now too.\n\nPlease learn from this. \nAs much as you are totally fair to point out that the situation was rough and you have trauma from it - it is not your sisters fault and you shouldn\u2019t resent her because she has been able to make it through the hardship and come out on the other side. You will have to unlearn your trauma responses and find healing and now is a great time to start.\n\nYou have your whole life ahead of you to create the love in your life you want and deserve. \nBut the first thing you have to do is realize other people also deserve some grace. And probably start a gratitude journal.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from and agree.", "Absolutely! You\u2019re very welcome. And thank you for sharing your insight. :)", "I mean.. I hate her and I haven't even met her."]}
