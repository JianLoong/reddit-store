They are very close and her mom has been with us about 50% of the last four years helping out with our kids. \n\nHer mom is nice but I have issues with her. She is a bad communicator, like literally mumbles all the time which is especially bad because I\u2019m communicating with her in what\u2019s not my native language and it is very difficult for me to understand. I constantly tell her to speak up and speak clearly and she just kind of giggles. Rude. \n\nAnyway, I try not to make a big issue of it (or that she\u2019s super pessimistic, or that she talks with her mouth full of food, or a million other things) because I know she\u2019s family now. It\u2019s on me to put up with it. \n\nSo, when my parents visited for just two weeks this behavior was not reciprocated by my wife or my mother in law.

I reminded her that I put up with her mom nonstop without complaints and asked her to refrain from speaking poorly about my parents, especially with her mom. \n\nI told her that it makes me very sad and uncomfortable and that she should understand how much it means to me that our relationship is finally repaired. It\u2019s not the time to complain about presents that they brought being inadequate. \n\nMy wife is furious now. Says I\u2019m \u201ccensoring\u201d her. Did I do something wrong?

What did your parents do? Ridicule is never ok it sounds very inappropriate. Censoring her? Odd comment also.. were your parents rude? Or inappropriate in any way? Did they do something to upset her? If she\u2019s simply making fun of them for me it would be a serious problem", ">Did I do something wrong?\n\nYes, you married and had kids with a person who is rude, subjects you to double standards, and gaslights for call out her bullshit.", "NTA. You will need to speak up about this when it happens again in the future because it sounds like they just got too comfortable with saying these kinds of things around you.", "NTA\n\nYour wife isn't censoring herself, so you have to try to. Normally, I would say people can say what they want, but when you're talking about someone else's parents/siblings/children, you're best to stay away from criticism, especially when it isn't asked for.\n\nThe rule of thumb is \"I can talk bad about my family, but you can't.\" There are obviously caveats to this, but to criticize someone's parents to the child (regardless of age) is generally considered to be obnoxious behavior. I can almost guarantee that your wife would NOT appreciate you be so \"honest\" about her mom. Get into the habit of just calling your wife and her mom out while they are talking badly about your parents. Don't let them just get away with it. With any luck, one of them will clue in eventually that they should stop and it won't be so bad.", "NTA.  Honestly up until I read the last paragraph I thought it was No assholes.  You're setting a boundary, but that can be uncomfortable for people not used to it.  I thought your wife was going to be like assuming you were mad or something.  But no she's hugely overreacting and not respecting the incredibly reasonable boundary you set", "NTA she should be able to speak freely with her mother as she wishes but not right in front of you or your parents. It's not censorship but respect", "Nah, based on your comments your parents are also not good communicators and were late constantly. That is very frustrating. I understand your wife needing to vent however she should not do that in front you if you are not comfortable with it. \n\nIt is 100% okay to not want to hear your partner negatively talk about your parents. However you choose not to bring up your issues with your mil and thats on you not your wife. \n\nAlso your mil being around for childcare is different than hosting a visit.", "NTA, stop putting up with you MIL.  Telling you that you are \"censoring\" her is a huge red flag.  This would cause me to rethink that marriage to be honest.", "NTA, but this sounds like racism and honestly it sounds like even your wife is a bit racist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that your wife said you were 'censoring' her was where I got that from, I'm just very accustomed to people crying \"freedom of speech\" to justify being bigots so the fact that she was using that kind of language suggested to me that she was potentially bigoted.", "Xenophobia, I called it below.", "Xenophobia at a minimum:\n\n\"Constantly, they were criticizing the way they talk, their clothes...\"", "so it\u2019s okay when her parents do it but not when his do it ? both parents seem to be AH but the difference is OP isn\u2019t talking about them and being rude", "She is clearly a bigot, OP don't want to deal with it.", "Possibly, but that isn't *racism*. Also, we don't know who is from where in this post. Of the mother-in-law, OP says:\n\n>I\u2019m communicating with her in what\u2019s not my native language\n\nBut we don't know what language they're speaking in this. Is OP's first language not English and his wife and mother-in-law are speaking English, or are the wife and mother-in-law from somewhere else and he was trying to speak in *their* native language? I knew someone whose native language was English but their partner's native language was Spanish so they made the effort to try communicating in Spanish sometimes. We don't have all the details here.\n\nAlso, \"criticizing the way they talk\" could mean a lot of things. A lot of people criticize the Californian \"valley girl\" accent, or vocal fry, for example. Or it could be about the way they speak in the sense of the actual word choice rather than an accent. A comment on their clothes might be because the clothes are that of a different culture, *or* because the mother-in-law thought they looked cheap/ugly/etc.\n\nThey were definitely being rude, but I don't think there's nearly enough actual detail to start calling these people racist or even xenophobic. Not unless OP wants to chime in with some important details about this.", ">I didn\u2019t feel the need to bring it up but everyone in the story is of the same race.  \n>  \n>Cultural and linguistic differences abound, however\n\nYep, xenophobia.", "I just clicked on the notification so I didn't see OP's response when I replied. Yeah, that does make it seem like there's some shitty xenophobia or something regarding the linguistic differences. I was only pointing out that I didn't think there was enough detail in the *original* post to justify calling someone racist or xenophobic."]}
