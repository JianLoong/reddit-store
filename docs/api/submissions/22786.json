Normally, I would say people can say what they want, but when you're talking about someone else's parents/siblings/children, you're best to stay away from criticism, especially when it isn't asked for.\n\nThe rule of thumb is \"I can talk bad about my family, but you can't.\" There are obviously caveats to this, but to criticize someone's parents to the child (regardless of age) is generally considered to be obnoxious behavior. I can almost guarantee that your wife would NOT appreciate you be so \"honest\" about her mom.

Is OP's first language not English and his wife and mother-in-law are speaking English, or are the wife and mother-in-law from somewhere else and he was trying to speak in *their* native language? I knew someone whose native language was English but their partner's native language was Spanish so they made the effort to try communicating in Spanish sometimes. We don't have all the details here.\n\nAlso, \"criticizing the way they talk\" could mean a lot of things. A lot of people criticize the Californian \"valley girl\" accent, or vocal fry, for example. Or it could be about the way they speak in the sense of the actual word choice rather than an accent. A comment on their clothes might be because the clothes are that of a different culture, *or* because the mother-in-law thought they looked cheap/ugly/etc.\n\nThey were definitely being rude, but I don't think there's nearly enough actual detail to start calling these people racist or even xenophobic.
