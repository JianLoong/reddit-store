Is your family dressing inappropriately, are they messy and mannerless?\n\nYou\u2019re trying to portray yourself from your own POV but you haven\u2019t told us how your wife may feel.", "NTA. You're giving her mom patience and respect (clearly she's surprised by your irritation so you've been hiding it well) and putting up with her being at your place 50%. It's bare minimum that she gives your family the same respect for a 2 week visit.", "Start being honest with your feelings about her mother. Tell her that you realize you have been censoring yourself and won\u2019t any longer. She can\u2019t complain about you doing the same thing she does.", "NTA.  My partner doesn't like me saying stuff about our son, even though I am completely in the right.  So I don't.  It is not hard to respect someone's request not to slag off any member of the family, no matter their behaviour.", "NTA people are super judgmental on here with little info.. honestly you have a right to have feelings here. If you don\u2019t like it that your wife and mother are being critical of your parents ( even if they\u2019re correct) they should respect your feelings. This is especially true since they don\u2019t see them that often. She\u2019s your wife. If it makes you feel bad,she shouldn\u2019t want to be doing it. I don\u2019t know how to approach it. I guess keep explaining it to her and hopefully she gets it.", "Your wife needs to take it down a fuck ton of notches. NTA.", "NTA. I expected to read a different post based on your title but the problem here is your wife. She lets her mom treat you like crap. And then treats your parents just as bad.  Tell her that her mom needs to go home until she can respect you in your home.", "NTA you\u2019re setting a boundary that you need in place for your mental health and your wife is not respecting it. She\u2019s an asshole if she can\u2019t understand how much it means to you to be repairing that relationship with your parents and not wanting her behavior to jeopardize it", "NTA\n\nIf you are \u2018censoring her\u2019 then maybe you should start uncensoring yourself and start complaining about her mom instead, see how much she appreciates that. Maybe that will get your point across\n\nBut seriously who does this??? She is rude af", "You didn\u2019t. You\u2019re asking for something reasonable. She could still think the same about your parents but keep her comments to herself. And eventually Ofcourse try and keep an open mind towards them. Btw, it\u2019s slightly cheap to comment on gifts people get, unless they are doing that with an ulterior motive.", "NTA just for the ask in the title - ibeyond that, ESH.   But i would expect your wife to be a little more gracious for the things your parents COULDNT control   like their clothes, how they speak.  Also\n\nNot helping with the kids enough  - how well do they know your kids?   Maybe this is something you should ask for from them and not just expect it, since this relationship between you all is just developing.", "CERTAINLY NTA. ignore these commentors, this is why Reddit should not be the place to turn for advice on a marital situation \u2014 the people in these comments are either children or unhappy people in their parents basements. Your wife was rude, simple as day, and you politely asked her to stop disparaging your family in front of you (hopefully at all).", "Nta", "Family is off limits to criticism in relationships unless the person on that side of the family brings it up. That\u2019s the only way to avoid this.", "I am Jewish and have size 34FF boobs. I once got called Ausch-titz", "Nta, ask your wife how she would feel if you did that to her mom. Maybe even do it a few times in front of both of them so they feel how it is.", "You're not censoring her, lol.  That is laughable.  You're asking her to respect you & your parents & she quite clearly doesn't.  Your wife is an AH.", "My partner and I have recently been through something similar, my dad and I are close, my partners parents aren\u2019t particularly close to any of their children to the point they think it strange if my dad and I go to dinner or spend time together without it being a special occasion. A recent moral issue had my partner and I disagreeing about his parents actions, after initially saying how much I disagreed with it, I told my partner from there on I would support him, regardless of my thoughts about what they were doing. It\u2019s ok to criticise people on both sides, as long as ultimately you\u2019re there to support each other.", "NTA.  Reciprocate and see how she feels then.", "NTA. I swear this subreddits answer to everything is 'divorce' though, christ \ud83d\ude02", "ESH. Have a little read back on your post. You literally criticise your mother in law for how she speaks TO HER FACE, then tell your wife and her mum not to do it in private to your parents? Um, a little self reflection is needed here.\n\nOh and just to head things off, yes, yes it is rude to tell a grown adult to \u2018speak up\u2019 you say \u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear that could you say it a little louder for me\u2019 but I suspect it has nothing to do with the \u2018loudness\u2019 of her speech and more to do with something else.", "More info needed, do they help with the kids? Are they as friendly? What are your MIL abd wife\u2019s complaints re attitude to kids? If they\u2019re mean to the children or underpins you, your wife or MIL sorry, all bets are off", "Your wife is a jerk. NTA", "YTA. You hid how incredibly rude your parents were in the comments. If you can't stand to hear mommy-dearest criticised, maybe she should learn some basic manners.", "NTA- that\u2019s completely disrespectful of her to do. How would she feel if you criticized and talked down on her mother? Wow you married a gem haha", "This comments want to make u feel bad bruh. NTA you would if I divorced her but no. Personally I will tell her to stfu", "The question is not about who was rude, it\u2019s about the reaction to rudeness.", "agreed. especially seeing the passive aggressiveness in the comments, I\u2019m sure the wife gets that from OP. \n\nESH but OP YT(main)A", "Is your wife talking about them in front of them or just venting to her mum as I think it\u2019s an important distinction. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be rude to them but if they\u2019re acting like you say and she\u2019s having to tolerate it then she should be allowed to be upset and vent about that.", "Esh. If her mom.is gross and rude you get to say so. If your parents suck, she gets to say so.\n\nThere is a difference between being expressing annoyance and constant bitching, but you both need to use your words more", "Ffs. Most children's lives get ruined because the parents DIDN'T divorce. But sure, let it fester and get worse and worse building up passive aggressive resentment that your kids get to study every single day. Good job.", "Cool, die miserable then!", "The downvoting is such a typical reddit response lmao. \n\n\"Oh, you have an atom's weight of strain in your relationship? DIVORCE. DIVORCE NOW.\"", "actually, divorcing someone BEFORE they inflict mistreatment on the kids is a GOOD thing. Good parents will act to protect their kids from being the targets of bad parenting. A divorce isn't the end of the world, and kids are far better off being with one parent who loves and treat them well, rather that in a two-parent household where one parent gaslights, mistreats or verbally abuses the other.", "Divorce doesn\u2019t ruin children\u2019s lives. But due to your own fing rudeness. Save the kids by giving them away and keep your ass there cause wow you two deserve each other. Both assholes,", "divorce does not ruin children's lives.", "It has been proven that couples who stay in bad marriages for the children\u2019s sake actually harm them instead of protect them. Kids feel the tension and hear arguments even if you think they can\u2019t. If you are unhappy, so are the kids. Either go to couples therapy or leave. Your current situation is worse.", "Love when OP gets the truth and they just go full stupid. \n\nTake advice or get the fuck out bro.", "I know he didn't say it; but hundreds of people dont read this as being sarcastic?", "By all means, continue ruining your own life with a partner that doesn\u2019t respect you.", "If that's how she shows her kids it's ok to talk about people and treat her partner, she's already ruining their lives and chances at healthy relationships in the future.", "It gave me quite a chuckle that you posted your business on a forum that basically guarantees unfettered feedback from strangers on the internet about martial issues and get defensive when divorce is a part of the discourse (the commenter didn\u2019t even suggest divorce\u2026 you brought it up). What did you expect?? Someone to send you a spell that will fix your wife\u2019s apparent bad attitude? SMH!", "Thats the hope! Honestly you sound like an AH lol. Glad you having a great marriage.", "I don\u2019t like when people divorce too quickly and don\u2019t give a chance to fix things. But it\u2019s much better 2 divorced happy parents then growing up in a toxic house. You are both repeating what your parents did to you. ESH", "No, but that's why the context of the visit is important. If they said something like 'we'd love to watch the kids a couple times while you guys have a date night!' and then they don't do that, that's kind of annoying especially when they're staying 2 weeks for free.", "> Let me tell a whole forum of people about how my wife and her mom ~~have zero respect for me or my family~~ **criticize my parents** and my wife ~~doesn't give a shit about my feelings~~ **talks back**.\n\nFTFY.", "> you\u2019re surprised that people criticize your wife?\n\nWhere do you get that idea?  OP was responding to someone who offered no advice or even an official judgement.", "Yeah, this argument is **that serious!**", "They understood that he was sarcastic, but the sad thing is that they probably agree with the top comment that says that he should divorce her over this.", "You should talk about it when it happens again in the future because it seems like they are very comfortable talking like this around you.", ">Honestly, if you're visiting someone for two weeks you better be helping the household in some way.\n\nThis.  It can be VERY stressful when family stays with you, especially if they just expected to get waited on and entertained the whole time with never helping.", "There's also a difference between making plans difficult because he can't decide what you want to do and just being soft spoken", "If you look at OP's comment history, one of his other recent posts is about how he is frustrated with his wife's decreasing interest in sex and that she has already told him he needs to either put up with it or find someone else. \n\nIt sounds like he is growing increasingly resentful of his wife and finding whatever reasons he can to act on his resentment.", "Probably the laundry list of things O.P. starts to complain about before getting back to the reason he posted in the 1st place.", "The people who get upvoted the most on here are usually posting assumptions that are very loosely focused on the original post. They are usually 'social justice warriors' who aren't even trying to help the person who posted.", "Seriously. I posted once about a silly ongoing beef between my hubs and I, don\u2019t even remember what it was now, thinking this is a cute one, people will enjoy this.  \n\nIMMEDIATELY turned it into a whole ass conspiracy of my husband\ntrying to dehumanize me and calls for divorce. Like my god, people, lighten up.", "Offensive and escalatory? Simple sarcasm.", "Yes I think someone can have a happy marriage and post for advice on a particular situation. \n\nPosting a question doesn't mean your life is falling apart. Spouses go through tough times and sometimes it helps to get an outside opinion of someone neutral who doesn't know either of you. \n\nWe don't know enough to make the assumption that they are miserable, have a failing marriage and need to get divorced.", ">Yes, you married and had kids with a person who is rude, subjects you to double standards, and gaslights for call out her bullshit.\n\nThis is what I was talking about. I am still not seeing that as sarcasm. This seemed like a sincere judgment, and I get why OP was a little miffed by it. Like, he posts on here about a minor argument with his wife, who is probably one of the most important people in his life, and the very top comment is about how she\u2019s so terrible that he\u2019s actually TA for even marrying her. And then sprinkling in words like \u201cgaslighting,\u201d which is a serious term that refers to domestic abuse. People are unbelievable here lol.", "OH NO NOT THE DOWNVOTES\n\nmake a shitty reference to the office in an AskReddit thread and duly receive your 10000 karma back", "Fair enough", "I don\u2019t disagree. Just explaining that OPs sarcastic response is why he got downvoted."]}
