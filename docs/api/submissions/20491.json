She did amazing and got amazing feedback from the judges, saying she was fantastic, fully caught their attention, \"wicked,outstanding and wonderful\" and star quality.\n\nHowever, when she was being introduced to perform, something annoyed me. The announcer introduced contestants like this - \"This schoolgirl from Norfolk will perform\", \"this A level student from Cheshire will sing\", \"this part time waitress from Manchester\", \"this LOTR enthusiast from London\", \"this footballer from Leeds\" etc, etc. This is also a way to get to know and get an understanding of the performers, since people were given the chance to vote for their favourites with 3 ribbons up for grabs.\n\nThis is how my daughter was introduced as \"this headmaster's daughter from Northern Ireland ''. This annoyed me. How is her Dad's job relevant? How does that communicate anything about her to the audience? and also the festival took place in a very working class area. When people think of school headmaster's they think it's an elite job due to the position of authority and think of those big fancy schools like Eton and Oxford. My husband's school is just a normal school, nothing elite about it but I could understand how it could seem that way to the audience. My daughter didn't win any of the ribbons and I was annoyed. I confronted the announcer a little while after about it and he said he wanted to give the contestants a unique introduction to avoid repetition. I asked couldn't he have mentioned her hobbies that were mentioned in the application form, her job as a part time cleaner, her experience or even just call her Northern Irish. He was very dismissive of my complaint.\n\nOn the way home, I was still annoyed about it. My husband noticed this and asked what was wrong. I stated my complaint and he said I was making a big deal out of nothing. It turned into a huge argument with him asking \"Do I only care about her winning rather than performing and having fun?\".

This could have easily been the case here, and for the sake of your daughter\u2019s confidence, you certainly would have been better to paint it in that light in front of her.\n\nAs to the argument with your spouse - your daughter DID do her best - the introduction had no bearing on her efforts at all.  Also I imagine your husband feels justifiably peeved, offended or hurt that his (perfectly respectable) occupation is being framed as somehow detrimental to his daughter\u2019s success.  \n\nYou need to dial your investment in your daughter\u2019s hobby back a bit so that you don\u2019t inadvertently make it a source of misery for her, that she will then drop.

Don't make yourself miserable over the small stuff.", "Apparently doing her best only means when she places/wins/gets ribbons. \n\nOP, YTA.", "I mean, maybe the  daughter had a terrible time. We don\u2019t know! That\u2019s what tipped the scale for me. 4 paragraphs and nothing about the kid except that the judges complimented her on her performance. Literally zero of the things about how she felt.", "There\u2019s a reason shows like America\u2019s Got Talent, So You Think You Can Dance, The Voice, American Idol, etc. do those sob story backgrounds. \n\nPeople love to root for the underdog. If given two people off the same talent level, but ones a spoiled rich kid and ones a poor orphan, people are going to pick the orphan most likely out of pity and/or empathy. \n\nIt definitely has an effect.", "No, but she made sure daughter was in the car while complaining about it\n\nYTA OP", "This made me giggle.  \ud83d\ude06", "The most accurate description tbf.", "Yesssssss", "Nope, in the car, on the way home with all three kids in the vehicle", "This is my question too", "My question as well.", "Very well said!", "Yup", "In fact, all three kids were in the vehicle", "I kinda understood too.. until she said they argued in front of the kids. Jeez.", "I'm thinking your daughter is old and smart enough to see or understand that when you kept defending your outrage with \"I just wanted her to do her best\" means that without ribbons or winning you don't consider it her best. \n\nHonestly, and really dig deep for this self reflection, would you have been this upset about if she had received any ribbons? Like be really honest? \n\nIf he hadn't introduced her that way and she still didn't earn any ribbons, what would you have used as a reason to be outraged she didn't win? Or would you have turned it actually on her, since doing her best to you only means getting ribbons, which every one else can see but you.", "Honestly, I think Hogwarts \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019d just come to say that?

If it\u2019s listed, he would assume it\u2019s one of the ways of describing her that she doesn\u2019t mind. Can he reflect on it? Sure.
