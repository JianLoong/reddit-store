She did amazing and got amazing feedback from the judges, saying she was fantastic, fully caught their attention, \"wicked,outstanding and wonderful\" and star quality.\n\nHowever, when she was being introduced to perform, something annoyed me. The announcer introduced contestants like this - \"This schoolgirl from Norfolk will perform\", \"this A level student from Cheshire will sing\", \"this part time waitress from Manchester\", \"this LOTR enthusiast from London\", \"this footballer from Leeds\" etc, etc. This is also a way to get to know and get an understanding of the performers, since people were given the chance to vote for their favourites with 3 ribbons up for grabs.\n\nThis is how my daughter was introduced as \"this headmaster's daughter from Northern Ireland ''. This annoyed me. How is her Dad's job relevant? How does that communicate anything about her to the audience? and also the festival took place in a very working class area. When people think of school headmaster's they think it's an elite job due to the position of authority and think of those big fancy schools like Eton and Oxford. My husband's school is just a normal school, nothing elite about it but I could understand how it could seem that way to the audience. My daughter didn't win any of the ribbons and I was annoyed. I confronted the announcer a little while after about it and he said he wanted to give the contestants a unique introduction to avoid repetition. I asked couldn't he have mentioned her hobbies that were mentioned in the application form, her job as a part time cleaner, her experience or even just call her Northern Irish. He was very dismissive of my complaint.\n\nOn the way home, I was still annoyed about it. My husband noticed this and asked what was wrong. I stated my complaint and he said I was making a big deal out of nothing. It turned into a huge argument with him asking \"Do I only care about her winning rather than performing and having fun?\". I replied I want her to do her best and that introduction more than likely cost her. It continued back and forth until we basically didn\u2019t speak until we got home.

If this really bothers you, maybe in the future you can speak to the announcer ahead of time, though that'll probably make you a bit unpopular anyway.

If that were the case, she\u2019d *have won the contest*. \nOP is upset for no reason.

Where I'm from (granted, not the UK) \"headmaster\" could easily refer to a parent of either sex. Bottom line is: OP's daughter is many things, factually including being a headmaster's daughter. For whatever reason, the person using a one-liner to introduce the contestants chose that, instead of for example \"avid lover of goldfish\"... It's a childrens' singing contest... I promise that not every single thing done or said by anyone ever is a direct attack on feminism or feeding into the patriarchy. I say this as a progressive woman. I'm sorry that that is the profound conclusion you came to from such an innocuous statement.", "You'd have a point of the guy hadn't introduced other girls with just their own characteristics. Clearly nothing to do with the \"patriarchy\".", "I mean, why do you think this though?", "I'm just saying some people jump to conclusions like OP, so I can see why it felt jarring in the moment.", "No, I wouldn't have.", "If you are from a place where you think headmaster could refer to either sex you are probably from a place that doesn\u2019t use the terms headmaster or headmistress at all, so that\u2019s a moot point. As a progressive man I don\u2019t believe every thoughtless act of internalized patriarchy is meant to be an attack on feminism, but each act sure does a very little part in upholding the patriarchy, and there is nothing wrong with pointing it out. I\u2019m absolutely sure the man did not consciously mean anything by using this girl\u2019s father to describe her, but he could have done better and there is nothing wrong with letting him know that.", "Agree to disagree. You can do it right a hundred times and still spend some introspection on why you did it wrong the one time. There were other things he could have used to describe her that were listed, but he was impressed by her father\u2019s title and used that. Not the end of the world, not a friable offense, I wouldn\u2019t throw rotten vegetables at him. But it is not wrong to point out to him what he did.", "Because OP is blaming losing the contest on something completely irrelevant. Seems like even if the daughter had been introduced in a different way, OP would still be raring to pick a battle over erroneous things. It wasn\u2019t about what the announcer said; OP is mad because their daughter lost, and she did not think that should have happened.", "Sure. You seem totally not prone to overreaction when you don\u2019t get what you want. I believe you.", "She's been pretty consistent saying her issue is that the kid was defined by the job if her parent rather than something about the kid themselves. \n\nidk it seems dismissive, I see it so often.

OP wouldn't be happy about anything, they just wanna be mad.", "OP is picking a fight not only with the person she blames, but also with her own spouse, and she\u2019s doing it in front of the child in question. To me, OP just absolutely wants to be mad. Most people get disappointed if they lose something, but this is not the correct way to behave when that happens, and OP has absolutely zero proof that this guy saying what he said had anything to do with the daughter losing. \n\nI think you defending OP is dismissive of her absolutely ridiculous behavior. So we\u2019ll agree to disagree.", "I'm not defending OP, I'm asking you why you made the judgment you did and disagreeing with your response. Is that not how conversations work? I'm genuinely asking, because I seem to get this sort of response a lot.", "You are defending her though. Your response to me was as follows: \n\n>idk it seems dismissive, I see it so often. OP just wants to be angry they're the asshole. OP wouldn't be happy about anything, they just wanna be mad.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just ask me to elaborate. *You told me I was being dismissive*.  If you think I\u2019m dismissing OP with my original thoughts (which, I never even voted by the way), you\u2019re implying that she in fact had a legitimate reason to be mad. Which again implies that you at least to some extent agree with her. \n\nIf you don\u2019t agree with her, I\u2019m not really sure why you needed me to elaborate on why I disapproved of OP\u2019s response to the situation. Especially because I had already summed it up in my first sentence that she was angry over something completely irrelevant."]}
