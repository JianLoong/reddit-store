And they seem okay with it.\n\nAnyways, my uncles birthday party was just yesterday and I finished making a cake for him the night before. I had decided to make a cake separate for the kids and for the adults. So I made a chocolate ganache cake for the kids ( I will be at the kids table) and a cake with alcohol for the adults.\n\nThe cakes both looked exactly the same. White frosting and chocolate sprinkles, for the adult cake,with permission from my parents, I took 10 beers and put them making a circle shaped. I put fondant over them and then covered it all in frosting. To be honest, the kids cake looked more appetising than the adult one but it was fine.\n\nAnyways, we arrived at their house and all was going good.An hour after lunch, my aunt and uncle  cut the  kids cake for the kids and after everyone (including me) got a slice. I went to the car to get the cake with beer. My uncle cut through the middle and took out all the beers. He was laughing while everyone stood there in shock.\n\n(This is my dads side of the family) My aunt started to scream and started berating me saying how I ruined her husbands cake and how I am only 16 and shouldn\u2019t give THEM the adults beer when they could\u2019ve bought it themselves. My parents stepped in and said that she had done it before with her other aunt and nobody cared. They then started screaming at my parents saying how they failed to raise me and how it wasn\u2019t fair that the kids get an actual cake and the adults get a foolish joke from a 16 year old girl. We shortly went home and I kept getting nasty messages from my aunt saying how I crossed the line and how I\u2019m disgusting.
