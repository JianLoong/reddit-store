I started a business during quarantine and I started baking pastry\u2019s and cakes when I was 9. I always make cakes for my family and friends but I do sometimes charge my friends if the cake takes longer that 4 hours and if the decorations are expensive. And they seem okay with it.\n\nAnyways, my uncles birthday party was just yesterday and I finished making a cake for him the night before. I had decided to make a cake separate for the kids and for the adults. So I made a chocolate ganache cake for the kids ( I will be at the kids table) and a cake with alcohol for the adults.\n\nThe cakes both looked exactly the same. White frosting and chocolate sprinkles, for the adult cake,with permission from my parents, I took 10 beers and put them making a circle shaped. I put fondant over them and then covered it all in frosting. To be honest, the kids cake looked more appetising than the adult one but it was fine.\n\nAnyways, we arrived at their house and all was going good.An hour after lunch, my aunt and uncle  cut the  kids cake for the kids and after everyone (including me) got a slice. I went to the car to get the cake with beer. My uncle cut through the middle and took out all the beers. He was laughing while everyone stood there in shock.\n\n(This is my dads side of the family) My aunt started to scream and started berating me saying how I ruined her husbands cake and how I am only 16 and shouldn\u2019t give THEM the adults beer when they could\u2019ve bought it themselves. My parents stepped in and said that she had done it before with her other aunt and nobody cared. They then started screaming at my parents saying how they failed to raise me and how it wasn\u2019t fair that the kids get an actual cake and the adults get a foolish joke from a 16 year old girl. We shortly went home and I kept getting nasty messages from my aunt saying how I crossed the line and how I\u2019m disgusting. So, am I TA?\n\nI feel like TA because I think I might\u2019ve ruined my uncles birthday party. I had no bad intention to get on my aunties nerves so I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

Your uncle thought it was funny and his reaction as the one you are celebrating is the reaction that truly matters.", "NTA, you did just fine with your cake. It's your aunt who is an asshole.\n\nBTW, I hope your cake business is doing well", "Definitely NTA (unless your uncle is a recovering alcoholic) there\u2019s no logical reason for your aunt to lose her shit. \n\nBlock your aunt... let your parents deal with her & her cake issues. Maybe she just has an enormous sweet tooth & she lost her mind when she didn\u2019t get cake. Her reaction is over the top & unhinged.", "NTA. Your aunt was out of line and ruined a good joke. As long as your uncle, who the cake/gag was intended for, was laughing, nothing else should have mattered. It\u2019s just cake.", "NTA Your beer cake sounds  hilarious and creative. Maybe another adult can give your aunt a firm talking-to. She was wildly out of line.", "NTA-you had your parents permission. Your uncle was laughing and thought it was funny. The only question is whether or not there was enough cake for everyone from the \u201ckids\u201d cake. \n\nRegardless of what your aunt thought, her reaction was massively out of line. Everyone isn\u2019t going to like every joke. That\u2019s fine. But when she opened her mouth, she was a really big AH. You don\u2019t \u201cparent\u201d someone else\u2019s kid right in front of their parents, you don\u2019t get to yell at a kid who made something for her uncle (even if it\u2019s the worst thing in the world), and you don\u2019t yell at someone in front of others in the middle of a birthday party. She threw a massive tantrum and you need to make sure you\u2019re not alone with her in the future.  Uncle too (because you used the word \u201cthey\u201d when you said they started yelling at your parents so it sounds like your uncle switched courses here).", "NTA. You even gave some of the children's cake to the adults. Your uncle thought it was funny. Next time, though just make a real cake. PS--your aunt is a pill and really rude. She could've just laughed.\n\nETA: in fact, don't bother to make a cake for that family anymore.", "NTA, it was your uncles birthday and he could laugh at it your aunt just overreacted.", "I think I might be confused so I just want to double check that I've read it right. So you made 2 cakes; one for the kids, which was a real cake and a fake cake for the adults which was cans of beer covered in fondant? So the adults didn't get any cake at all? If I've understood it correctly, then I can kind of see why your aunt is upset as it sounds like all of the kids, including yourself, got cake and all of the adults got cans of beer covered in icing. She definitely shouldn't have spoken to you the way that she did and she shouldn't be harassing you now. Can you block her number for a bit and let your parents deal with her? \n\nIf I've got it completely wrong and the adults did get some real cake too then I have no idea why she is upset. If I've read it right then NTA as your uncle found it funny, but if you were to do it again I would suggest having a real cake for after they cut the fake cake. That way, they get to experience the joke, and eat your delicious cake. Good luck with your business, I hope you get plenty of orders.", "NTA - you had permission and it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. Your aunt should also be apologizing to you if she said the things you mentioned here. Really disgusting to say that to a child. \n\nAlthough moving forward, I would suggest if you make a prank cake, you should probably also make a real cake that you hide and use after the prank cake is cut (or making sure the \u201ckids cake\u201d is enough for everyone). Also couldn\u2019t hurt on letting the party host in on the joke. In this case, it probably would have been nice to tell up your aunt in advance. Definitely not justifying her behavior because it was awful, but a bit of consideration in the future so the party host (assuming it was your aunt?) knows what to expect might be a nice gesture.", "NTA\n\nThey can make their own cakes next time.\n\nI thought it was funny.", "NTA- your aunt is intense. That seems like an absurd reaction and I wonder if something else is going on and your aunt took out her stress/frustration in you. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that, especially since your uncle clearly thought it was funny. I wouldn\u2019t make any more cakes for her in the future.", "NTA. Your aunt needs help. Your Uncle laughed, that's all that matters.", "NTA\n\nIf I understand you correctly, there was a cake and everyone who wanted, did get a piece of cake. The beer cake was an extra birthday surprise.\n\nHonestly, you should have swapped seats with your aunt, you sound like the adult and your aunt the child.\n\nYou have so much respect from me for chasing your dream, don't let your aunt get to you, I am sure your parents are extremely proud of you and you can be super proud of yourself, that is all that matters.", "NTA only because you successfully gauged your uncle\u2019s humor. You would be the asshole if this was your aunt\u2019s cake or if your uncle is a recovering alcoholic.\n\nAlthough, coming from someone who has family of alcoholics/drug addicts, their habits started very young, at around your age. I don\u2019t know your personal life, but just be very careful being desensitized to alcohol at your age. Alcohol can ruin your life, and even danger the lives around you. Be happy and keep your good sense of humor.", " NTA. It\u2019s not like you were drinking the beer and your parents had to buy it for you. \n\nIt\u2019s a cake, not a keg. \n\nNow you know what not to do in the future with that side of the family.", "But was it an actual cake? Or just beer cans? Because of it was just beer and no cake YTA. \n\nOf it was cake surrounded by beer\u2026like not even a funny joke but NTA", "NTA, your aunt is an ungrateful ass..\nIt was still the same cake just with an added surprise.. she needs to grow up and calm her tiddies..", "NTA Fuuuuck Auntie needs to take a chill pill or chug one of those beers.", "NTA,  the birthday guy enjoyed... aunt was just jealous because she was expecting something delicious....\n\nEdit: i see that she ate the kid's cake, so idk wtf her problem is...", "NTA.  Block your aunt on all your social media/texts.", "If your auntie is going to throw a tantrum like a child then I guess she can have some the children's cake.

Your Aunt was looking forward to more cake, sweetie. It wasn't about you. She wanted cake. period. Tell her you will bake another one ( just make it simple) and deliver it for peace offering, and you are sorry to offend. She won't admit she wants cake, so you have to be the adult here. :)  Or don't even tell her, just make one and show up, and she will be ecstatic simply because there will be less people around to share with. I was that aunt... (without the yelling. i wouldn't have done that part)... i would have been terribly disappointed to not get cake!", "She sounds unhinged.", "Aww thank you! I have 2 cake orders this week so I\u2019d say it\u2019s going alright! :)", "In another response, OP says that the aunt had kids cake, so she (and probably all the adults) got to enjoy actual cake.... but yes, the \"real\" cake was just beer covered in frosting/fondant", "Thank you!", "NTA \nI think it was beer covered in frosting to bamboozle the uncle,  which it did.

I guess it depends how many people were there and how big the kid's cake was. If everyone got a slice of cake then aunt can't really moan, but I would suggest having a real cake to cut after the fake cake has been cut if OP ever does this again in the future.", "Sheesh you\u2019re touchy\u2026 i mean uncle might have liked it but she still didn\u2019t make him a cake. \n\nI\u2019ve literally read two other AITA in the last ten days with similar circumstances and the prankster was AH but because this one is a teen they aren\u2019t. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nHe might have found it funny but you\u2019re still ta for not making a real cake \u2026 i mean she said the kids, including her, had cake and the adults hadn\u2019t had cake yet.

Or at least not be surprised by it?", "I have to try this", "They are surprised bc they didn\u2019t like that I did it since I\u2019m only 16 and they are very strict on who has to do it. Not much of a tradition tho. It happens sometimes but everyone was just shocked as in confused and surprised that I never done it. My aunt was screaming because she thinks I\u2019m too young to do these jokes", "Right ok, that makes more sense. Maybe when your parents gave you permission they should have run it past your aunt as well, just so she was aware, especially if there are strict rules about who can and can't do it. That said, her reaction was incredibly over the top and she owes you an apology. I would leave it to your parents to sort it out and try not to worry about it. You didn't ruin his birthday. If it was ruined it was because your aunt started screaming like a lunatic."]}
