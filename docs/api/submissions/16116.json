They have Teddy (11M) and Rosie (9F). I have a daughter, Lia (10). All the kids go to the same private school. \n\nFor the past two years, Seb has been dating Casey. Casey has a daughter, Hannah (10). They\u2019ve been slowly blending families for a while (spending weekends/holidays with the kids at each other\u2019s homes etc) and to their credit they done their best to make it smooth. They got engaged a couple of months ago after finding out that Casey is pregnant, and Casey and Hannah will be moving in with Seb and Teddy during the summer. This means that Hannah will have to change schools. \n\nFor context, Seb makes good money, but not enough to afford to put the kids through school comfortably. To avoid him taking money out of the funds for the kids set up by his dad, I offered to pay for Teddy and Rosie\u2019s fees. Seb wanted to pay me back in instalments but I said no. \n\nCasey invited me to coffee, which I thought was odd, but I went. Once there, Casey said she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for Hannah to attend the same school as all the kids next year and she was hoping I\u2019d be able to help out like I do for Teddy and Rosie. She said taking the kids to school and activities would be a nightmare if they weren\u2019t all in the same place (not true), and she worried it would create a divide between the kids. I admit, I was in shock and my brain was working but not faster than my mouth and the only thing that came out was \u201cI barely know you\u201d. I immediately apologised, but Casey was already offended. She went on to say I can't expect her to set her child up to be isolated and I said the only one expecting anything here was her, and incorrectly at that, because I was not going to fork out hundreds of thousands of pounds. She said I should be willing to help since I helped Seb's kids. I said that was different, and Casey said why, I wasn\u2019t related to them either. I thought this was incredibly disrespectful to the relationship that I have with Seb for most of our lives and that I\u2019ve always had with Teddy and Rosie, who have pretty much been like extra kids to me. I told her I didn't owe her or her kid anything, and that her shameless entitlement was embarrassing to me if not her, so I was leaving. I called Seb on the way home and told home everything.\n\nSeb said he had no idea that Casey was planning this, and after he spoke to her he apologised on her behalf. However he also said that Casey is now rethinking the move. Apparently she says she doesn\u2019t see why she should move Hannah from a school she is happy in to be treated as \u201csecond rate\u201d. Everyone I\u2019ve spoken to says I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty, but I\u2019m worried that Casey not moving will mean Seb isn\u2019t able to be a present father to his new child, and that will feel like my fault.", "created_utc": 1682936265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134igv7/aita_for_not_saying_to_paying_for_my_brothers/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Casey and your brother are taking the wrong approach.  You paying for school for Teddy and Rosie means Seb & Casey should be able to afford to put the other kids through school. You are indirectly helping Hannah. If she doesn't attend, it isn't on you at all. I see Casey wanting another hand out and trying to guild trip you into it.", "Yikes sounds like red flag written all over it.

But at the same time this is not your problem. Your brother has been lifted from two tuitions he was willing to pay you back, so I don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t be the one paying the tuition of his fianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money, you decide what to do with it. Just because you were able to help your brother financially with his first two kids it doesn\u2019t mean that your generosity should be taken for granted. If you can\u2019t afford to send your kid to a private school then your kid can go to the public school, easy as that. She wanted to take advantage of your good heart and her plan failed.", "NTA. Like you said - you barely know her. It was entitled for her to expect you to cover her kid that you have no bond to. What would she do if you didn\u2019t exist? It\u2019s not a throuple and your finances should have no factor here. She sucks for putting you into this situation.", "NTA\n\n>Casey is now rethinking the move. Apparently she says she doesn\u2019t see why she should move Hannah from a school she is happy in to be treated as \u201csecond rate\u201d.\n\nThat's Casey's problem, not yours. It sounds to me like she was basing the move on you agreeing to pay her kid's private school fees and is now throwing a tantrum because you said 'no'. She's hugely entitled and it wouldn't surprise me if it turns out that money is playing a large part in her decision to be with your brother. She sounds like a shameless gold-digger.\n\n>I\u2019m worried that Casey not moving will mean Seb isn\u2019t able to be a present father to his new child, and that will feel like my fault.\n\nNope, not your fault at all. Casey created this problem by taking it upon herself to demand thousands of pounds from you behind your brother's back and anything she decides to do in response is entirely on her.\n\nHopefully your brother doesn't ignore the huge red flags she's waving and breaks off the engagement himself.", "She doesn't want her daughter to go to the same school as your niece and nephew, what she wants is a FREE RIDE for her daughter, just like the one you give to your niece and nephew. Your brother should be able to afford to pay for this girl's tuition since he doesn't have to pay for his own children. And she can work to pay for it as well. This request is seriously disgusting and shows you her true character. I wouldn't want my brother to marry someone with that kind of character. Now she is threatening to break up this new family to manipulate you into paying for her daughter. This is purely a tactical move. Do you really think she is going to pass up on your brother's financial support by combining households and his help with the baby out of spite? Stay strong, because if you open your wallet to this woman, it will never end.", "NTA\n\nPaying for your niece and nephew is one thing (even tho they aren't blood, they might as well be).  And paying for a child who you don't know is another thing.  And she shouldn't have been offended by you saying that you barely know her - that is a fact.\n\nShe should have worked out all her finances with Seb before accepting his proposal and falling pregnant again.  If she can barely afford one child, I'd hate to think how she's going to afford 2.", "NTA she wants a handout and a free ride.... I'm  sure the school may have scholarships she can apply for...my daughter goes on a scholarship.... \nShe cant plan out your money you have your own life and bills....", "NTA\n\nIf I were you I would encourage him to not consider marriage without a prenup. She sounds foul, for her to feel as though she is entitled to your money, for her to say that you aren\u2019t related to your niece and nephew, don\u2019t bother getting a wedding gift, maybe get your brother some glasses so he can see what his Fianc\u00e9 is really like.", "call me cynical but I wonder if she'll bail on Seb now she knows she can't depend on your money for the rest of her brood", "NTA. Whilst I can understand that Casey doesn't want to have disparity between her partner's kids and her own daughter, which could make it harder for them to see themselves as siblings, you have no obligation to pay for your (step-)niece and (step-)nephew, let alone your (step-)brother's partner's child. \n\nSince Seb had offered to repay you, in instalments, but you declined the offer, then logic suggests he might have saved up some money in the meantime that could go towards Hannah's schooling. However, the more they spend on private education now, the less will be saved later for Hannah's further education. \n\nIf Casey approached you to make it a private school education for Hannah happen without even having a conversation with her partner about the options, then it would suggest a distinct lack of communication in the relationship.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you should have to pay for Casey\u2019s kid. But I also think Casey is right and that she shouldn\u2019t move her child to a new school where she is going to watch her siblings go off to a fancy private school everyday. If you are unwilling to help then Seb and Casey should either budget differently to be able to afford to send her on their own, or consider moving to where Casey is instead. But they cannot mix the family while leaving it so blatantly unequal, something will have to change, or they are not going to mix and your brother is going to get partial custody of his baby.", "Why are you involved in this family daily living affairs? Seb can pay for & decide what to do with his own kids & Casey can decide where she wants to live & send her kid to school. \n\nNTA \u2014 just don\u2019t get involved.", "NTA you said Seb can't pay for both his kids. Surely he can afford to pay half for Hannah, and his gf pays the other half? Either way,  not your problem, and the audacity of his gf to even ask you!! \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude33", "NTA- however Casey is right that for their family it is not good if 2 out of 3 children on roughly the same age go to different school based on money. Casey was out of line discussing this with you without you stepbrother being involved and she said some very wrong things, but the frustration is understandable.\n\nI really hope you can set previous issues aside and have a good discussion based on facts between the three of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not the asshole.  But I can't disagree with Casey making this choice either.", "Not to mention that Seb and Casey will have extra by paying for one place to live, not two, and that Casey likely has child support to help as well.", "I am not sure if Seb wants to pay her daughter's school fees either, tbh. I didn't ask him, but knowing the kind of parent he is (Rosie and Teddy are EVERYTHING to him), I'm not sure he'd be willing to take 25k (and more as they get older) out of his budget for looking after his children to send another kid to school. Not to mention, he has another one soon to be born so he'll be thinking about the upcoming cost of educating them too.", "I am not sure Seb would even want to pay for Hannah's schooling, we haven't talked about it, but Rosie and Teddy are his whole world, I'm not sure he'd want to take 25k a year (only to increase) out of his budget for looking after them to pay for Hannah's schooling, especially knowing he has another kid coming to provide for.", "Seb can't move to where she is, because he shares custody with his ex, to the point where there isn't really a set schedule. She has remarried and her stepson goes to the same school as the other kids, so it's not possible to uproot all of them. Casey can move because she doesn't have a 50/50 custody arrangement.", "I don't know if he'd want to do that, even with half that's 12.5k a year he could be using to take care of his kids, or save for the one coming.", "She wouldn't be able to pull them out of school, their mother would never allow it, nor would Seb. He adores those kids, he'd never sacrifice their education or wellbeing for Casey's pettiness.", "I don't know if Seb would want to do that. I haven't asked him, but knowing how hard he tries to give Teddy and Rosie the best life possible, I don't know if he'd want to commit 12.5k per year (this will go up exponentially when the kids move to high school) to Hannah's schooling. Especially when he now has another child to save for.\n\nEven if he could put up the money, knowing what Casey does for work, I am not sure where she'd be able to find that much extra money for her half.", "You know your brother, and it makes sense. At the same time, if they are living as a family unit, his stb step-daughter should go to the same school as the rest of the children. I know most schools give a discount for each additional child that attends. And the responsibility for the school fees should be on Casey. She can work while the children are at school to pay for this, can't she?", "Well, that reinforces my vote that Seb & Cassie are both TAs here.\n\nWhen you get married (note - YOU ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED, your brother is), there is a certain expectation that your step child is NOW your child also.  And they should be trying to provide a somewhat equal level for all of the children.\n\n> Not to mention, he has another one soon to be born so he'll be thinking about the upcoming cost of educating them too.\n\nRight;  and he should be treating the child about to be born, equally as the stepchildren.  Treating the stepchildren worse than their half brother is a receipe for disaster.", "Understandable. The only three people who need to be having a conversation about Hannah's schooling are Casey, Seb and Hannah. Four, if Hannah's dad is still in the picture at all. Whilst a minor, Hannah should at least be party to some of the conversation because she might not want to go to private school, Hannah might prefer to go to public school even if it can't be the same school as she currently attends. \n\nIt is interesting that this has cropped up now. After all, they've been dating and blending families for a while, they got engaged a couple of months ago after finding out about the pregnancy, and they've already got a timeframe for the move.\n\nIt suggests either Hannah's education was an almost afterthought, or Casey had expectations that either weren't discussed or haven't come to fruition - like she was hoping to talk Seb into paying himself or expecting Seb to come to you cap in hand.", "So then really the options are that Casey and Seb budget to figure out how to do this on their own, or Seb has partial custody while dealing with long distance. Casey is right, moving her daughter into the house while her siblings get such unequal treatment is completely unfair to her daughter, she shouldn\u2019t move. That\u2019s just how it is. You aren\u2019t at fault in any way, but you are correct that you not helping will mean that your brother has a harder time being with his baby. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty about it, but if you can easily afford it you could see it as helping your brother instead of helping her.", "I still think you are NTA,  but I kinda don't blame the gf for not wanting to move Hannah from a school she likes and is happy at  only to be put in a different school from her stepsiblings, and knowing no one. To be clear, this is your brother's problem,  not yours in any way.", "Let's hope so.\n\nStory time.\n\nI was an only child. My grandfather paid for my private schooling. Mother died, father remarried a woman who had a child. They tried to pull me out because they couldn't afford to pay for him to attend the same school. (I do sympathise their point: it's very divisive to have a two-tier schooling within one family.) In the end my grandfather paid for her kid too, such as to allow me to remain at my school.\n\nI am not saying you have to pay for her kid, or the one she's currently cooking. Just an insight into what they'll be worrying about. I still think she is handling it appallingly.", "INFO: why are they planning to get married and blend families if they\u2019re going to treat the children so differently? It seems odd that they hadn\u2019t discussed schooling given your detailed description of how careful they were to slowly integrate.", "That isn't how Seb and I were raised though, nor anyone else we know with divorced parents, so I can see why they don't see it that way. Not that each other's parents didn't love us or labelled all our food and everything, but and I lived in the same house, and went to different schools, and had different rules. My stepdad didn't buy me things just because he bought Seb things, my mum didn't take the same interest in Seb's academic performance as she did in mine (just examples), but that doesn't mean we didn't end up loving each other or each other's parents, but we each had our own set of parents, it wouldn't be fair to us or them to have another one unilaterally forced on us. Or at least that's how they saw it.", "I explained this in more detail in another comment, but for a while they thought Hannah might not have to move schools, so it wasn't as deeply considered.", "I'm sorry you had to go through that at that age. Blended families are complicated.\n\nWith this situation, Maddie (Seb's ex) is remarried to a man whose son also goes to the same school, so even if Seb got onboard with taking the kids out of school to be \"fair\" it would create \"unfairness\" in their other household, and Maddie wouldn't stand for it. They're both great parents, I have faith in them doing what's best for their kids.", "I don't think they are treating the kids differently, I think that the reality is that treating them the same will result in an inequality of lifestyle. Casey doesn't pay for anything for Rosie and Teddy, Seb doesn't pay for anything for Hannah, technically that's equal treatment, it will just have unequal results. It's the same way Seb and I were raised. We went to different schools even though we lived in the same house, if Seb's dad bought him an iPad it didn't mean I would get one, I had to ask my own dad. We had different rules and boundaries in the same house, but we still grew up extremely close and close to each other's parents, so it's not like it can't work.\n\nWith the schooling, it was a recent discussion, because for a long time they were trying to see if Hannah could still attend the same school, but ultimately it was decided that the travel was just not feasible as Casey's work moved locations recently as well. Seb presumed Casey would move Hannah to the local state school, but obviously that turned out not to be what Casey wanted.", "Thanks for that.\n\nNTA - but leave this to them. Your (reasonable) unwillingness to fund Hannah\u2019s fees isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s simply shone a spotlight on their different expectations and understanding of what getting married and blending their families meant in practice.\n\nThis is *their* discussion and agreement to have. Not yours.\n\n(That said, it\u2019ll come back to you when you\u2019re asked about their as yet unborn child.)"]}
