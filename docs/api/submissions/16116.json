It\u2019s your money, you decide what to do with it. Just because you were able to help your brother financially with his first two kids it doesn\u2019t mean that your generosity should be taken for granted. If you can\u2019t afford to send your kid to a private school then your kid can go to the public school, easy as that. She wanted to take advantage of your good heart and her plan failed.", "NTA. Like you said - you barely know her. It was entitled for her to expect you to cover her kid that you have no bond to. What would she do if you didn\u2019t exist? It\u2019s not a throuple and your finances should have no factor here. She sucks for putting you into this situation.", "NTA\n\n>Casey is now rethinking the move. Apparently she says she doesn\u2019t see why she should move Hannah from a school she is happy in to be treated as \u201csecond rate\u201d.\n\nThat's Casey's problem, not yours. It sounds to me like she was basing the move on you agreeing to pay her kid's private school fees and is now throwing a tantrum because you said 'no'. She's hugely entitled and it wouldn't surprise me if it turns out that money is playing a large part in her decision to be with your brother.

Your brother should be able to afford to pay for this girl's tuition since he doesn't have to pay for his own children. And she can work to pay for it as well. This request is seriously disgusting and shows you her true character. I wouldn't want my brother to marry someone with that kind of character. Now she is threatening to break up this new family to manipulate you into paying for her daughter. This is purely a tactical move. Do you really think she is going to pass up on your brother's financial support by combining households and his help with the baby out of spite?

Whilst I can understand that Casey doesn't want to have disparity between her partner's kids and her own daughter, which could make it harder for them to see themselves as siblings, you have no obligation to pay for your (step-)niece and (step-)nephew, let alone your (step-)brother's partner's child. \n\nSince Seb had offered to repay you, in instalments, but you declined the offer, then logic suggests he might have saved up some money in the meantime that could go towards Hannah's schooling. However, the more they spend on private education now, the less will be saved later for Hannah's further education. \n\nIf Casey approached you to make it a private school education for Hannah happen without even having a conversation with her partner about the options, then it would suggest a distinct lack of communication in the relationship.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you should have to pay for Casey\u2019s kid. But I also think Casey is right and that she shouldn\u2019t move her child to a new school where she is going to watch her siblings go off to a fancy private school everyday. If you are unwilling to help then Seb and Casey should either budget differently to be able to afford to send her on their own, or consider moving to where Casey is instead. But they cannot mix the family while leaving it so blatantly unequal, something will have to change, or they are not going to mix and your brother is going to get partial custody of his baby.", "Why are you involved in this family daily living affairs?

You are not the asshole.  But I can't disagree with Casey making this choice either.", "Not to mention that Seb and Casey will have extra by paying for one place to live, not two, and that Casey likely has child support to help as well.", "I am not sure if Seb wants to pay her daughter's school fees either, tbh. I didn't ask him, but knowing the kind of parent he is (Rosie and Teddy are EVERYTHING to him), I'm not sure he'd be willing to take 25k (and more as they get older) out of his budget for looking after his children to send another kid to school. Not to mention, he has another one soon to be born so he'll be thinking about the upcoming cost of educating them too.", "I am not sure Seb would even want to pay for Hannah's schooling, we haven't talked about it, but Rosie and Teddy are his whole world, I'm not sure he'd want to take 25k a year (only to increase) out of his budget for looking after them to pay for Hannah's schooling, especially knowing he has another kid coming to provide for.", "Seb can't move to where she is, because he shares custody with his ex, to the point where there isn't really a set schedule. She has remarried and her stepson goes to the same school as the other kids, so it's not possible to uproot all of them. Casey can move because she doesn't have a 50/50 custody arrangement.", "I don't know if he'd want to do that, even with half that's 12.5k a year he could be using to take care of his kids, or save for the one coming.", "She wouldn't be able to pull them out of school, their mother would never allow it, nor would Seb. He adores those kids, he'd never sacrifice their education or wellbeing for Casey's pettiness.", "I don't know if Seb would want to do that. I haven't asked him, but knowing how hard he tries to give Teddy and Rosie the best life possible, I don't know if he'd want to commit 12.5k per year (this will go up exponentially when the kids move to high school) to Hannah's schooling. Especially when he now has another child to save for.\n\nEven if he could put up the money, knowing what Casey does for work, I am not sure where she'd be able to find that much extra money for her half.", "You know your brother, and it makes sense. At the same time, if they are living as a family unit, his stb step-daughter should go to the same school as the rest of the children. I know most schools give a discount for each additional child that attends. And the responsibility for the school fees should be on Casey. She can work while the children are at school to pay for this, can't she?", "Well, that reinforces my vote that Seb & Cassie are both TAs here.\n\nWhen you get married (note - YOU ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED, your brother is), there is a certain expectation that your step child is NOW your child also.  And they should be trying to provide a somewhat equal level for all of the children.\n\n> Not to mention, he has another one soon to be born so he'll be thinking about the upcoming cost of educating them too.\n\nRight;  and he should be treating the child about to be born, equally as the stepchildren.  Treating the stepchildren worse than their half brother is a receipe for disaster.", "Understandable. The only three people who need to be having a conversation about Hannah's schooling are Casey, Seb and Hannah. Four, if Hannah's dad is still in the picture at all. Whilst a minor, Hannah should at least be party to some of the conversation because she might not want to go to private school, Hannah might prefer to go to public school even if it can't be the same school as she currently attends. \n\nIt is interesting that this has cropped up now. After all, they've been dating and blending families for a while, they got engaged a couple of months ago after finding out about the pregnancy, and they've already got a timeframe for the move.\n\nIt suggests either Hannah's education was an almost afterthought, or Casey had expectations that either weren't discussed or haven't come to fruition - like she was hoping to talk Seb into paying himself or expecting Seb to come to you cap in hand.", "So then really the options are that Casey and Seb budget to figure out how to do this on their own, or Seb has partial custody while dealing with long distance. Casey is right, moving her daughter into the house while her siblings get such unequal treatment is completely unfair to her daughter, she shouldn\u2019t move. That\u2019s just how it is. You aren\u2019t at fault in any way, but you are correct that you not helping will mean that your brother has a harder time being with his baby. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty about it, but if you can easily afford it you could see it as helping your brother instead of helping her.", "I still think you are NTA,  but I kinda don't blame the gf for not wanting to move Hannah from a school she likes and is happy at  only to be put in a different school from her stepsiblings, and knowing no one. To be clear, this is your brother's problem,  not yours in any way.", "Let's hope so.\n\nStory time.\n\nI was an only child. My grandfather paid for my private schooling. Mother died, father remarried a woman who had a child. They tried to pull me out because they couldn't afford to pay for him to attend the same school. (I do sympathise their point: it's very divisive to have a two-tier schooling within one family.) In the end my grandfather paid for her kid too, such as to allow me to remain at my school.\n\nI am not saying you have to pay for her kid, or the one she's currently cooking. Just an insight into what they'll be worrying about. I still think she is handling it appallingly.", "INFO: why are they planning to get married and blend families if they\u2019re going to treat the children so differently? It seems odd that they hadn\u2019t discussed schooling given your detailed description of how careful they were to slowly integrate.", "That isn't how Seb and I were raised though, nor anyone else we know with divorced parents, so I can see why they don't see it that way. Not that each other's parents didn't love us or labelled all our food and everything, but and I lived in the same house, and went to different schools, and had different rules. My stepdad didn't buy me things just because he bought Seb things, my mum didn't take the same interest in Seb's academic performance as she did in mine (just examples), but that doesn't mean we didn't end up loving each other or each other's parents, but we each had our own set of parents, it wouldn't be fair to us or them to have another one unilaterally forced on us. Or at least that's how they saw it.", "I explained this in more detail in another comment, but for a while they thought Hannah might not have to move schools, so it wasn't as deeply considered.", "I'm sorry you had to go through that at that age. Blended families are complicated.\n\nWith this situation, Maddie (Seb's ex) is remarried to a man whose son also goes to the same school, so even if Seb got onboard with taking the kids out of school to be \"fair\" it would create \"unfairness\" in their other household, and Maddie wouldn't stand for it. They're both great parents, I have faith in them doing what's best for their kids.", "I don't think they are treating the kids differently, I think that the reality is that treating them the same will result in an inequality of lifestyle. Casey doesn't pay for anything for Rosie and Teddy, Seb doesn't pay for anything for Hannah, technically that's equal treatment, it will just have unequal results. It's the same way Seb and I were raised. We went to different schools even though we lived in the same house, if Seb's dad bought him an iPad it didn't mean I would get one, I had to ask my own dad. We had different rules and boundaries in the same house, but we still grew up extremely close and close to each other's parents, so it's not like it can't work.\n\nWith the schooling, it was a recent discussion, because for a long time they were trying to see if Hannah could still attend the same school, but ultimately it was decided that the travel was just not feasible as Casey's work moved locations recently as well. Seb presumed Casey would move Hannah to the local state school, but obviously that turned out not to be what Casey wanted.", "Thanks for that.\n\nNTA - but leave this to them. Your (reasonable) unwillingness to fund Hannah\u2019s fees isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s simply shone a spotlight on their different expectations and understanding of what getting married and blending their families meant in practice.\n\nThis is *their* discussion and agreement to have.

If your brother can\u2019t afford tuition for the kids he already has, he shouldn\u2019t be making more kids. \n\nCasey is looking at this a really weird way. You\u2019re generously paying 2/3 of tuition costs, they just need to figure out the other 1/3. She and Seb have choices about what they prioritize. \n\nHer reaction makes me wonder if she\u2019s into Seb, or she\u2019s into your money.", "NTA at all.  You are being very generous to pay what you do, and to have some virtual stranger pretty much demand your money is unbelievable.\n\nThey are marrying each other, NOT you. You are not at fault at all!", "NTA. This woman is slick I won't lie \n\nIt wasn't just that she asked you, but that she avoided telling Seb she went to ask his brother for money. She knew he would not approve. She didn't care.\n\nNow she's holding the move for ransom until someone pays for her kid to go to private school?\n\nAnd she's pregnant?\n\nMan, your brother is in for a wild ride", "It might feel like your fault, but it isn't.\n\nI'm also curious if Hannah was gonna invite you to coffee again when the baby was of school age, because their plans inevitably would be to send all kids to roughly the same schools so no one feels disenfranchised, but if Casey can't afford one child she won't be able to afford two nor will Seb have the finances to provide that.\n\nNTA", "NTA but they do have a point that if all the kids are attending the same school but one, it can impact her negatively.

These are choices they need to weigh as a couple. The welfare of her child does not fall on you, and the relationship your brother has with the newborn is also up to the mom. If she cared more about the baby than her pride she would work things out with her fianc\u00e9 rather than place the blame on you.", "NTA I think the only decent decisionmaking I see is you saying no and Casey realizing she probably shouldn\u2019t move and uproot her daughter to live in the same house with kids who have a better quality of life than her.

You have to explain to the trustees why you want to essentially take money from your children and it's up to them if they release funds to you, even for education. 2.

A move to begin living with a partner, and experiencing pregnancy, can both individually impact and heighten any feelings of vulnerability or financial insecurity that already exist (it\u2019s a lot of sacrifice for a woman, transitions are inherently difficult, and it leaves her with far less stability in place if things don\u2019t work out between them).\n\nYou\u2019re not TA, but your brother absolutely needs to be thinking about Hannah not being the lone excluded stepchild PRIOR to Casey and her moving in.

Casey may be moving away from whatever support systems she has in close proximity (and making new friends is hard as an adult), and depending on how close family is to her currently, this could be an enormous risk for her to take (will a family court allow her to even move back if they break up and dispute custody?).  \n\nAgain, none of this is your responsibility.

Considering how she will no longer be paying rent/mortgage nor other bills when she moves in with your brother (yes she will help him pay for housing/utilities but that usually means she has to cover less than she is use too) - it would seem she could put something towards her child's education and then see about increasing child support to cover education.

Again, she cannot force you to pay for Hannah's schooling, but I could see how maybe she thought it wouldn't hurt to ask, and then, when she was met with another no, she just broke. \n\nPerhaps she's seeing that her daughter is the only one having to make changes in this new family, meanwhile her step-siblings will all get to stay in their rooms, in their houses, in their school with their friends. \n\nAnd what about the little half-sibling? Will this little one also be an odd one out?

Let's say one parent is wealthy, showering their bio children in lavish gifts and expensive private education. The other parent is poor, cannot afford any tutoring or extra curricular activities, certainly cannot afford a college fund or any kind of long-term financial security. All children live in the same home and are treated \"equally\" according to you, which means bio parents provide for bio kids. In a single, blended home, the rich kid gets thousands of dollars worth of gifts at Christmas, they know they have a trust fund and college fund, and they know they will be financially supported  well into adulthood. The poor kid gets to sit and watch while the other kid gets opportunities they could never dream of. And you would call that equal?\n\nETA you are in no way financially responsible for Hannah, I agree with you 100%. I don't agree with Seb not wanting to sacrifice his \"real kids'\" money to support his stepdaughter.

I thought I was commenting back to him.", "100% agree", "She has a job, just not one where she can afford to pay this:\n\nQuoting OP:\n\n>It is about 8k per term for primary school. That\u2019s over 24k a year, per child. For secondary school, that will go up to an average (it increases gradually as they age) of 40k per year per child.\n\nAnd Seb is seemingly unwilling to help to pay for Hannah at all. But I bet he will want the child he has with Casey to go to a private school.", "No the three grand children already here. Op\u2019s child and brothers 2.\n\nAnd from my understanding the brother will have no choice but to continue to take the money as the brothers children bio mom will not allow them to be moved. \n\nSo either brother will have to pay in full or take money out of his 2 older kids trust to pay or op can pay. Keeping the brother from taking the money out of the older kids trust is the reason op started paying in the first place.\n\nAnd like I said the trust was set up when each grandchild was born by grand father. I don\u2019t know if the new baby will have a trust. I don\u2019t think op said if the grandfather is still alive or not.", "And that's why your step brother will have visitations and weekends with his third kid. Good for Casey for not sacrificing Hannah so in favour of your selfish step brother.", "It's wrong. I don't blame Casey for reconsidering the move and the relationship.", "If you think a private education is so important, why isn't it as important for Hannah? Sounds like your brother does have some money that was left to him and that you want to make sure Hannah doesn't benefit from it.", "I don't know where they live, but public schools are everywhere. Of course his brother has a choice! \n\nThe OP replied back to me that the grandfather is still alive, but has some degenerative disease and that his mother (the grandmother) has power of attorney. Since Seb is his stepbrother, I think the grandfather is Seb's father. This is just a weird dynamic, because the OP should know what it feels like to be the stepchild. \n\nTo throw another detail into the mix, it sounds like the OP's mother (the 2nd wife) has control over the family money rather than Seb, which would be the logical line of inheritance, no? Don't get me wrong. The OPs mother is the grandfather's wife and as such his money is her money, but isn't it hypocritical now to try and keep a step-granddaughter from getting any family money for private school just because she's not blood-related?", "I mean, I wonder if she's spoken to Hannah about it. It sounds like Hannah is currently happy at her school\u2014maybe she wouldn't want to go to the same school as her new step siblings. I know I was thrilled when I switched schools and got to go to a different school than my sister.", "Knowing someone since birth isn't the same as meeting them 10 years later.", "Op paid for her neice and nephew.

Rosie and Teddy have trust funds from their grandfather but that is their money, not Seb\u2019s.", "The bio mom (50/50 custody) would not agree to the two older kids being moved out of school.  Sorry if I didn\u2019t make that clear. But my understanding is that if op doesn\u2019t pay for the other 2 the brother would have to take it out of the trust or pay himself. But the older 2 children\u2019s bio mom is in the picture and would have to agree to have her kids moved she won\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t see where op said they where still alive but in one of her post she said her mother and stepfather always had the rule they paid for the big expenses for their bio kids and was not responsible for the step kid in their life. If this is the case I guess it would not be hypocritical. They would expect cassy to pay for her daughter and the brother to pay for his bio kids. I guess that\u2019s how that would work.\n\nI also seen where op said the older kids would probably go to boarding school as they get older. So I don\u2019t know how that would work either.", "I think it's rich that she feels this way and now she wants you to pay her daughter's school?", "But he is still choosing to take responsibility of her by marrying her mother .Especially since they would be uprooting their lives for his convenience. Loads of step parents take responsibility for far less. And she's still a ten year old kid not a grown adult there is still room for a parent child relationship.", "You're right in that they have no obligation to pay. Doesn't mean he's not a dick for excluding the step daughter.", ">AITA for not saying to paying for my brother's fianc\u00e9's daughter to go to private school?\n\nPresuming the grandfather is dead...did he setup trust funds for his grandchildren with no thought that there might be additional grandchildren? \n\nNow that Seb's wife-to-be is going to give birth to a \"blood-related\" grandchild, will that child be expected to go to public school with Hannah or will it all of a sudden have the necessary pedigree to qualify for your educational dollars? \n\nThere are only two things you've said that I agree with:\n\n1) Casey should have never asked you. That was presumptuous and rude. \n\n2) You have no obligation to pay tuition for anyone even if they are your niece and nephew, but I have the feeling that you think \"blood-related\" makes your position fair and reasonable. It doesn't. \n\nI hope to god that your brother has a bigger heart than you and shows his soon to be stepdaughter that he loves her by enrolling them all in public school or find a way to pay for Hannah to join her siblings at the private school.", "The OP is a stepdaughter too so I don't understand why she wants to make sure Hannah is an outsider. She seems to be well off too if private school is \"hundreds of pounds\". I get that she still likes her ex-sister in law, but I still think the best thing to do is to stop paying for her step-brother's two older kids. It's an insult to the soon to be sister-in-law and I think she knows it. She's just on here for validation to ease her guilty conscience. \n\nThe only thing Casey should apologize for is asking the OP to cover Hannah's tuition. That's just plain rude. If the bio-mom won't take the kids out of private school, there isn't much Seb or Casey can do about that if Seb isn't the one paying. It would have been a nice compromise if Seb had agreed to move so that Hannah could continue at her old school. Depending on how far away that is probably would affected Seb's visitation with his two older kids. If I were Casey, I wouldn't move - at least not until Hannah graduated high school.", "It\u2019s a child who he doesn\u2019t know. \n\nI don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t go around giving children in my family expensive gifts. Related or not. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what op can afford. This is an expensive gift. That they started before the step daughter was even in the picture.\n\nPlus cassy child will have a very different life than op and her brothers 2 kids.

My mother now has power of attorney.", "Op said it would affect custody. They said the custody agreement is the kids come and for as they please. Nothing strict.\n\nI am not sure if I was in op\u2019s position if I pay the extra amount of money to include a 3 child. My understanding is it\u2019s $25000 a year. Which is a lot. They may be able to aford it but I don\u2019t know if too many people that would be generous enough to pay $75,000 a year for schooling for children stat are not yours. Her neice and nephew apparently are like extra kids to her so I kind of understand. But is she pay for Hannah that would put op paying $100000 a year in schooling. Then what happens when the new baby is old enough to go. That would put op paying close to a million dollars in 8 years in school fees. That\u2019s a huge chunk no mater how well off you are. I can see if she started to pay when the older 2 where little and the parents couldn\u2019t afford it not wanting to stop now. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know if I would take on the expense of adding 2 more either. Plus even if she did what happens when it\u2019s time for the older 2 go to college.
