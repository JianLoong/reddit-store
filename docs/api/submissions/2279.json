I would say \u201cGet a liquor cabinet that locks,\u201d but it sounds like you have this figured out. Some things are fine for sharing (leftovers, laundry detergent, etc.) but she needs to replace the whiskey bottle ASAP. Shouldn\u2019t even be a question. \u201cOh wow, we must have been super drunk to not see the card- I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll go get a brand new one right now.\u201d \n\nAlso, maybe questioning having the BF over if he can\u2019t respect your shit too!!", "NTA, she's stealing from you and is pissed that you won't let her.", "NTA. An expensive bottle of whiskey is pretty hard to mistake for anything else and her guests, her responsibility. If this is how she repays your kindness of letting her stay at cheap rates, I'd be reconsidering the arrangement too because she's clearly starting to take it for granted.", "NTA\n\nShe technically stole from you and is refusing to pay you back. If your parents are so concerned, they can replace the bottle and pay the difference of her rent.", "NTA not even a discussion", "NTA.

OP your sister is a thief, thieves don\u2019t like getting caught because they\u2019re thieves, plain and simple, you caught your sister stealing and decided to hold her accountable for her actions, honestly OP up your sister\u2019s rent she\u2019s had it too good for too long.\nAlso, why are your parents getting mad at you?", "even if it wasn\u2019t a gift she should still be paying it back. the little thief needs to learn not to steal, and to definitely not allow their bf and friends to go through other people\u2019s shit", "Hold up, your parents are pissed with you?\nSometimes family doesn't realise how good they have it unfortunately. Should she replace it, absolutely.  Should your parents get involved? Absolutely not.\n\nAt the end of the day is it enough to loose a family member over, probably not. \nThere is nothing wrong in asking your sister to pay her own way in life, and if your parents think that's unfair I'm certain they will support her.\n\nNTA", "NTA and if your parents are pissed they're enablers who spoil their daughter, or she didn't tell the whole story.", "NTA.  Calmly present her options: be an adult and replace what was clearly a gift or don\u2019t replace it and leave the apartment.  Either way her boyfriend is not welcome anymore.", "NTA. She\u2019s stealing from you. You\u2019re being very generous in just upping her rent and not kicking her out.", "Her so more than you but you can still make it right.\n\nWhy she's the AH is clear:  She shouldn't be drinking your liquor and since it was a gift she owes you for the whole bottle.  This part is a no brainer.\n\nWhy ESH is I think you went from 1/3 a whiskey bottle amount of money and being mostly OK with your roommate situation to suddenly asking her to pay rent you know she can't afford and effectively rendering her homeless.  It sounds like you were acting out of anger and being a little immature because she refused to do the right thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe the rent increase is a bit over the top but a replacement whiskey bottle is not.\n\nEdit: in fact, I wouldn't even go so far as to call her a 'thief' like every extreme comment on here has.

All these people see is that one child is making the other child pay more than they can afford. The reasons don't matter to them. \n\nThe way I see it, if OP's parents don't want their daughter paying fair market value for rent, they can pay the difference. The thing that gets me is that OP's parents probably have that bullshit attitude \"oh, you can afford it so it's not a big deal\". Which really annoys me when people have that attitude. \n\nThis is a perfect example of why people should never live with family or buy property/businesses together. I very rarely ends well. I speak from personal experiences.", ">At the end of the day is it enough to loose a family member over, probably not. \n\nNo. This logic is never valid because it always *always* applies to the person actually at fault too. Here - should this be worth losing a family member to OP's sister? Plus her cheap accommodation? Plus no doubt everything else OP is providing?\n\nAnd if it is, why should OP value it any more than that?", "> I leave beer and seltzers in my fridge and if a few go missing I never ask her about it.

I'm saying that this isn't - but that it's up to the sister to make amends, and if she doesn't, *then the fact that* ***she*** *thinks this is worth a relationship with OP*, should make him reconsider.\n\nBecause it's a relative. There's no point in OP being the only person who values his relationship with his sister if she doesn't.", "NTA I don't understand people these days.

What whiskey?", "NTA - but I am confused why she just doesn't buy her own alcohol?", "NTA, but you guys probably could have handled it more civily.
