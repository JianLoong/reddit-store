One was in grad school and the other was a freshman living off campus against school policy (she lied and said she lived with her parents). She bought a dog she didn't take care of that pissed everywhere and tried to bite my BF in the face without provocation, but the final straw was her drinking all my alcohol. It was hard to find and I had to drive half an hour to a town that stocked it. I told her that was absolutely not ok and that she needed to replace it. She whined and the other roommate backed her up that she couldn't possibly replace it because she was underage. I think my brain broke at that point because she had sourced it plenty of times before that. She did eventually replace it, but it involved a lot of huffing and drama.", "NTA \n\nShe knows she messed up and she\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll let it slide. You\u2019re being more than generous by offering to let her reimburse for the bottle or pay market rent. I would actually add a third option: eviction", "Nta I mean you could lock the cabinet like she's a child but that won't stop her from doing whatever else. She can reimburse you immediately, start paying half the rent, or move out.", "NTA - It's time she learns that the world doesn't exist to subsidize her entitlement.  \n\nShe owes you a new bottle, give her the rest of the old one since she bought it, and I don't blame you for upping the rent with her attitude.", "NTA. You said it was clear it was a gift, and they still opened it. She either owes you for a full, new bottle, or extra rent. or both.", "NTA", "Not an asshole, but seeminngly a kind responsible keeper of your sister who is clearly unappreciative and unwilling to be self aware enough to know your sacrifices. Her boyfriend can pay for half and she can pay for half but either way the bottle is getting 1000% replaced or the room should be, by a full paying roommate.\n\nedited to add: clearly your parents add to your sisters entitlement & take advantage of your responsible nature.", "She\u2019d been crossing lines already by helping herself to a limited amount of your alcohol even after you told her not to.  Pushing limits is one thing but getting into your friend\u2019s clearly marked gift is entitled AH behavior. \n\nIf her impulse control is that bad maybe she\u2019s not grown up enough to live away from mom and dad. \n\nNTA and hold your ground.", "NTA\nswilling the good booze rather than just taking the cheap stuff as you tolerate is an extra AH movie", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is the Ah here.", "NTA all the way.\n\nAnd yeah charge her a full share for the rent; sounds like your parents either have favorites or have some internal misogynism to work through if they think anything you're doing is not okay. I'm sorry it's causing issues with them but they're part of the problem here.", "NTA.  One thing I've learned is that when you are broke, cheating is very tempting.  It takes a lot of character to keep your integrity when you don't have enough money for even the smallest treats.  I personally think it isn't an excuse to cheat, but I do understand it.\n\nI think you might be better off not having any kind of financial relationship with her.  Tell her that you understand that she doesn't think she's wrong, and that makes her untrustworthy and you don't want the stress of wondering how she will cheat you next time and then justify it.  She needs to move out.", "Nta", "NTA -  and being firm and implacable will help your sister grow up into someone who can respect others boundaries and property", "You did buy something worth \u20ac200. Your self respect.", "Drinking age in the US doesn't actually apply if you're in your own house so at least she's off the hook for that", "To be fair, in my state in the US the drinking age is also 5 if with parents. It's absolutely not illegal to let a kid have a glass of wine on special occasions at home in most of the US.", "Where was the indication that this will be permanent? OP said she can *start* to pay extra, and if he can raise the rent then he can lower it too. This is probably a situation where the sister pays OP and he pays the total rent to the landlord, so he can control how much she contributes", ">Kinder egg because they're too dangerous...\n\nIt's actually an old law that says you can't mix inedible items with food/medication.  This law was passed after over 100 people died due to ethylene glycol poisoning in 1937 because a drug company used diethylene glycol to make an oral preparation of a medication not realizing it broke down into ethylene glycol in the body.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir\\_sulfanilamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_sulfanilamide)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal\\_Food,\\_Drug,\\_and\\_Cosmetic\\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act) (the law)\n\ntagging u/AraedTheSecond", "\"start paying\" and \"because she plans on using my stuff\"\n\nI guess I'm making an assumption, but I think it's a much bigger stretch to assume he's just adding it to her rent this month to force her to pay. That doesn't make sense for the wording, but it also just doesn't make sense practically because making her pay that amount, say $100, won't be any easier if you call it rent than groceries.\n\nOP doesn't have to give his sister discounted rent, and taking advantage of her cushy living situation like this makes her an AH, but raising her rent over one bottle of whiskey her friends drank feels like a bit of an overreaction.", "NTA - it was clearly a gift but they were entitled brats and went for it. That has consequences. Tell her to have her bf and friends pay her back but she needs to pay for the full amount. I would then start locking up all alcohol.", "NTA.  \n\n\nGet your money back.  \n\n\nAnd, her and her friends are full of BS. Who goes into a liquor cabinet and sees a really expensive bottle, that obviously doesn't belong to them, and think it's okay to open it?", "Nope. You're NTA. But you're well on your way to being a doormat...", "NTA, tell your sister that they stole from you, so they have 30 days to vacate the apartment.  Oh, and tell your parents that they can mind their own business since they didn't teach your sister not to steal gifts meant for others.", "NTA. She is wild and clearly might develop a problem. Settle things fast while you can", "ESH why put a gift in the liquor cabinet you fucking imbecile?", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. You sister for drinking something that was clearly a gift, but OP  as well for leaving such an expensive bottle in the \u201cshared\u201d liquor cabinet. If you bought the bottle that you mentioned in the comments-glenfiddich single malt- in your bedroom.", "NTA\n\nSister is entitled and arrogant about your property.  I don't think the stolen whiskey will be the last problem - it would likely be better for you if your sister moved out.", "NTA, she needs to pay you back.  Your parents are pissed about what?

We're not talking about a $10 bottle of Evan Williams, lol.", "Yeah I think that's really fucked. I just would be wanting to know the *why* of it. Like they clearly had a good enough relationship to start living together in the first place.", "She\u2019s 20 and turns 21 in 3 months.

They should be mad that she's stealing but nope, they get mad at you for upping her rent to replace what she took.
