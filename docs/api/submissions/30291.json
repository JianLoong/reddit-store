I live with my mother M\u00e1rcia, who is 33 years old and a single mother, it's worth noting that she has schizophrenia. Some time ago, I had a cat. Even though I worked at a buffet and earned very little, I took care of him on my own and covered all the expenses. Whenever I came home after work and school, Mitch, my cat, was the first thing I looked for.\n\nDespite always telling my mother not to let him out on the street, she would always let him out, claiming that he liked Elaine, a neighbor I have. But one day the worst happened, and he was hit by a car. The driver admitted fault.\n\nWhen I found him, he could barely walk and had difficulty breathing, in addition to keeping his mouth open. I immediately took him to the vet, where he was treated urgently and hospitalized for a day because he needed oxygen. Upon leaving the hospital, I bought the prescribed medications and administered them according to the instructions. I fed him with a syringe and took care of him, but sometimes when I came home, my mother had given him extra doses of the medication, which led to arguments, but she never listened to me.\n\nThere was a slight improvement in the cat's condition until three days ago when he stopped eating and started vomiting. At first, I thought he had eaten something that didn't agree with him, but soon realized he was getting worse, and I couldn't understand why.\n\nI practically begged my mother to take him back to the vet, but when I got home and asked where Mitch was, she said she had let him out. At that moment, I already knew what had happened. I searched for him in the neighborhood and found him in a pile of bushes, lifeless. I tried to call my mother, but she said she didn't care. I cried for 30 minutes looking at his lifeless body, hoping it was a lie. She didn't take him to the vet and let him out on the street again.\n\nI'm still angry with her, but she says I'm to blame for the story because she had a stomachache, and I should have been at home (I was at school thinking she would take care of him). I feel terrible and guilty for not being able to save the life of the only thing that mattered to me.\n\nI thought that was all until my neighbor called me and said that my mother had told her that she didn't like my cat and had given him more medication than he could handle. I was always responsible for his medications and never let it exceed the ideal amount, but apparently, when I left the house, she gave him not only his medications but also hers. I don't want to see her anymore, and I've been staying at a friend's house since then.

Would they be willing to let you stay there if you go to the counselor at school and report what your mother did and said to you? It is not safe for you to stay at home. \n\nIf not your friend can another relative take you in?

Hugs honey.", "NTA at all honey. You went above and beyond for Mitch and you are a caring and strong woman. You are not to blame in any of that\n\nYour mother was not capable of taking care of Mitch and I'm worried if she can even take care of you. Stay with your friend (and family i guess) and see if there's any available help for your situation. From that info only is hard to know, but your mother doesn't look like she should even have your custody", "It sounds like your mom is an extremely uncaring person\u2026. Why would you have any desire to live with someone like that. If you have another option to be in a healthier environment\u2026. Choose it.

You cannot trust her in anything ever again.", "Honey, NTA, very NTA - you\u2019re a loving, empathetic, beautiful person and I\u2019m so sad for the loss of your friend. That pain hurts like no other. You say your mother has schizophrenia- that is a very chaotic disease, and hard for even an adult to deal with. Is there anyone else you can live with? Your dad? Grandparents? Aunts or Uncles? You need more childhood than you\u2019re getting at the moment. Good luck sweetheart. Get through this and you\u2019ll thrive.", "I agree with all other NTA comments here, but I just want to make one thing very clear: there lies *zero* fault with you, and while it's normal to feel guilty after something like this, you did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nAs hard as it may be to hear, your mother killed Mitch. He got in the accident due to her reckless endangerment in the first place (which you repeatedly asked her not to do), and then afterwards she poisoned him--and then let him out again for good measure.\n\nWhile her schizophrenia may explain some of her mindset, it does not excuse her actions. Someone who kills a beloved pet, and then tells the person who loves said pet the most that they are at fault for their death, is not someone who should be allowed to have custody of a teen. I hope you have extended family that can take you in.\n\nYou may feel somewhat responsible for your mother due to her schizophrenia and how you possibly took more care of her than the other way around while you were growing up, but her mental health is *her* responsibility. You are not obligated to stay in touch with her as long as she is not working on herself--at the very least working on not being what seems to be an actively dangerous person to be around.\n\nI'm curious, though: why did your neighbour not intervene when your mother told her she was actively poisoning your cat? While my dramatic ass would likely kidnap said cat straight to the vet if someone told me that, there's also numbers you can call for things like this, not to mention she could have alerted you earlier.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
