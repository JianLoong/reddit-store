After asking around, I was recommended Intro to Chemistry as the lesser of evils (Biology was my original pick but the professor had a 1/5 on rate my professor and the Chem professor had a 5/5).\n\nKnowing science isn't my strong suit, I studied VERY hard with the goal to just pass.\n\nThe problem was, this class was graded on very few things. Attendance (20%), a midterm (40%) and a final (40%). By the time the midterm had come around, I had created a study guide of around 80 pages. I knew a large group of students primarily in greek life met to study alongside my roommate, but I was never invited and when I asked my roommate she said it was a greek life thing only.\n\nMy roommate is in the class with me, but we aren't close. She came back one night while I was working on my study guide. She asked what I was working on and, stupidly, I admitted it was a study guide for the midterm. She asked if I could send over a copy to her to compare notes, and as I was trying to be kind agreed to do so but asked her to keep it to herself as it was my hard work. Yes I feel dumb now.\n\nI passed my midterm and I was absolutely hyped. The semester continued but the large group of students started skipping class entirely.\n\nThe final came up and I created another study guide... 200 pages (yes I cry thinking about it). I had a scholarship I needed to keep and I just needed to pass to hold onto it. One time I went to office hours, I was asked by another student if I had the final study guide. When I asked what he was talking about, he mentioned my roommate and said that her roommate (me) had made a midterm study guide that let everyone pass. I basically had inadvertently helped everyone who wasn't paying attention do well because they just memorized my work.\n\nI realized in this moment that the reason why students stopped attending class was because they were banking on my final study guide (also corroborated through conversations with my roommate where she let slip that she didn't need to understand the material, just memorize pre-existing notes).\n\nA week before the final exam, my roommate asks me if I could send my final study guide. I straight up told her to her face, \"nope.\" As it got closer and closer to the exam, her texts increased.\n\nThe midterm class average was a 70%. Not bad for Intro to Chemistry. The final? A 17%. I got a 67% but it got curved up to a 97%. I passed with a B+!\n\nMy roommate yelled at me as she failed the final and mentioned I caused others to fail and not graduate as well. My roommate said I should have done the right thing just as I did for the midterm exam and hand over the study guide to help others.\n\nAITA for not sharing my final study guide with my classmates and causing them to fail?  \n\n\nEDIT: Quick responses to your top questions.  \n1. Why no lab? This is an Intro class for non-STEM students only. It's more a 'concepts' class. There's no lab but there's a lab for the Intro to Chemistry for STEM students.\n\n2. Your roommate is in greek life but doesn't life in a sorority house? My school doesn't have sorority houses and the housing they do have for greek is optional.\n\n3. The curving makes no sense? Average was a 17% on the final, top grade was an 80%. The 80% was turned into a 100% and everyone was scaled 20-25%.

Empathetic people who strive to work hard and prove themselves.  And selfish people who want the attention, the glory and the praise, but don't want to do ANY of the work.  The second type of person will ALWAYS throw a temper tantrum when things don't go their way. (Cause they don't understand the way things work, and don't take the time to learn, and they are frustrated because they don't understand WHY they don't get their way).  (The empathetic person will ALWAYS go into self introspection mode and WONDER if they were in the wrong, even when they know they weren't).

NTA.", "Grades are earned, not given.  Your classmates earned their grades by tanking their 20% attendance grade and by not studying for the final.  Too bad, so sad.  It\u2019s a good life lesson.  NTA", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. They made the choice to not show up. They can retake the course and hopefully they\u2019ll take responsibility for their own education this time.", "NTA", "NTA.  They refused to allow you to spend time with them but they want your hard work? Nope. \n\nTHEY caused themselves to fail by not studying.  Anyone who agrees with them is an AH and should be blocked and avoided.", "Nta- it\u2019s their own fault for not going to class or study! Screw them and your roommate for starting them on that. They need to blame her", "NTA, you didn't cause anything \ud83d\ude44 part of college is learning to take responsibility for your own schedule and attendance... guess they needed to learn the lesson", "NTA  they caused themselves to fail by not attending class or studying", "NTA\n\nThose idiots fucked around and found out.", "Not only that but gave people the impression that she and the roommate (OP) had created the study guide together. She deserves it.", "As someone who got an English degree and then a CompSci degree, I was absolutely shocked by how much crueler STEM professors were and how that significantly worsened the design of their classes. Grading an entire class based on attendance and two tests doesn't make sense within any pedagogy. It's completely counterproductive to the goal of education, though that often doesn't seem to be STEM professors' main concern.\n\nObviously, the individual students are directly responsible for never showing up to class, but that outcome was inevitable with that setup. STEM professors act like they have no power over their students' behavior, which really just shows how little they care about teaching.", "Yep. If she had not shared she probably would have ended up with an A. But now he\u2019s a B+ after a curve got her 97% on a test worth 40% of the grade.", "I\u2019d do a search for confidence or self-esteem or whatever other key word you can think of.", "English schools have similar \"clubs\" and \"societies\" on campus. It's not exactly the same, but social groups converge and build relationships that often benefit members for life.\n\nThe movie \"Animal House\" showed the excesses of Greek life.", "It\u2019s common for intro classes to not have labs and OP mentioned this is an intro course.", "Often not for freshman.  You have to be on campus already to rush, ie attempt to get admitted.  Then as a sophomore you can move into frat/sorority housing if they have housing and have room.", "That completely depends on the size of the fraternity/sorority house and the number of members.\n\nYou often get a group that lives in the house but others who live in dorms or off-campus at home or their own (or shared) apartment.", "We thought for years that our college town had the brothel law still on the books - we had frat houses but sorority dorms (which were optional to live in). At some point we all found out that was a myth, and the real reason was because there was a Greek life statute that said all the sororities had to have houses of equivalent value or none of them could, and the college just didn't have the property. Several years after I graduated, the campus expanded, bought up some houses, and now there are sorority houses (we only had 3 sororities during my time, not sure if there are more now). But we definitely had a lot of laughs over the ridiculous brothel law!", "Are you \u201cA\u201d gator?", "Greek life advisor here.  The brothel law is a myth.  Most likely the campus either wanted to keep the female sorority members on campus for financial reasons or safety.  The chapter I currently advise has a mix of housed and unhoused sororities.  Houses are expected, and many chapters can't afford it.\n\nOP..NTA.  Your roommate had no right to profit off of your hard work, and she and her friends can go pound sand...or pound the books in summer school.", "Not sure what my college team is called, I graduated in the 90's, LOL", "I also went there in the 90s, but transferred elsewhere so didn\u2019t graduate from there.", "NTA\n\nWhat a bunch of leeches, your rommate being the worst of them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey're old enough to put priorities in order. They failed for their own lazyness\n\nYou did the right thing by giving them a reality check", "Even thought your roommate was an asshole, your attitude of \"others should fail if they don't work hard like me\" screams insecurity\n\nEdit: You could've gone down as the legend that saved everyone's ass in class but instead you are now a jerk for most people (even thought you are not necessarily at fault) and got a good grade that a year down the line will be irrelevant", "NTA!\n\nGreek life is all about the group cheating for each other to get ahead. And they used *you* who weren't on their group. They got what they deserved.\n\n> The midterm class average was a 70%. Not bad for Intro to Chemistry. The final? A 17%. I got a 67% but it got curved up to a 97%. I passed with a B+!\n\nJust desserts! The sweetest kind.", "NTA\nI\u2019m the same kind of person.

We don\u2019t need people who are not self-motivated to get diplomas. Good job putting your foot down and best of luck with future classes. Hopefully you can find a new roommate soon though. Because they\u2019re bound to be petty or aggressive.", "NTA, I had many people asked for my old exam/ review before the semester started as I took the class before them and I should have it. They would curse, blame and throw tantrum if I don\u2019t give it to them. Can\u2019t believe students now day.", "NTA.

You didn't cause them to fail, they did. Stop thinking about it and keep your future study guides for yourself.", "NTA, you did not cause anyone to fail.  They did that to themselves.  You are not responsible for their bad habits or lack of studying, or even lack of attendance.", "NTA. I had this issue with chemistry as well. I always took really great and detailed notes. Before each test, I\u2019d copy/paste the relevant info onto a study guide (and then compile all my study guides into one huge one for the midterm/final). I always had scrubs hounding me for my notes and shit, and I let it slide once. Until I realized they weren\u2019t putting in any effort and just piggybacking off me to pass. Yeah, no. I cut that shit out so fast. It\u2019s time for them to sink or swim, and don\u2019t give a f*** about what they choose to do.", "NTA.\nYou are not the professor.  It is not your job to teach your classmates.  It is not your responsibility if they fail.\n\nAlso, holy crap!  The average on the final was 17%?!  And, even with a 200 page study guide, you originally only got a 67%?!?  Thank goodness for the curve!  That sounds like a really tough class!  Congrats on passing!", "NTA for not sharing your own notes when you told your roommate not to and she lied, doing it anyways. \n\nBut wtf, an introduction to chem class had a 17% average on the final? WHAT? I'm glad you passed but what kind of professor is this that 1) you felt the need to make a 200 PAGE study guide for, and 2) has a final that averaged out to 17% when you got a 65 on it? How the hell do they have a 5/5 on rmp? This sounds insane, an intro class where most people catastrophically failed the final? Even without paying attention to class you can read through the book and study up the week before finals when your classmates realized they weren't getting access to your study guide. This class sounds hellish for an intro to chem class, like organic chemistry is probably what I hear most chem majors struggle with after hitting the bottleneck courses but Intro???", "NTA. Good for you for saying no. Those other students are responsible for their own failures.", "NTA. You shared the first one out of kindness and asked her to keep it to herself.

Your roommate needs a reality check", "NTA. \n\nYour roommate fucked around, and now she's finding out. \n\nBut I'm sure you learned a lesson about trusting people you don't know that well.", "NTA They got what they deserved. Congrats on passing!", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for providing other students with educational materials.\n\nThey are in charge of their own education. \n\nThey chose not to attend class because they made an assumption that you would create another study guide, AND it would be available to them.\n\nSo that\u2019s their own fault. \n\nThe right thing would have been for them *to attend class*.", "YTA and a shitty friend. Drop out", "NTA. You didn't \"cause\" anyone to fail. They didn't study and didn't pass.\n\nPlus change your roommate if you can. She betrayed your trust and paid the price.", "Nta, you said no, and instead of preparing for the exam on her own, she wasted her time begging you, AND she didn't alert any of her peers who were banking on the guide. She broke not only the promise to not share the guide but also the promise that she made to the other students. Even if the other students were slack offs, they were promised something that they did not get, and that\u2019s on the person who offered the service. The roommate was an asshole not only to you but to all those students. She just isn't willing to accept fault for her actions and instead trying to put the blame on you", "If they did well enough in the midterm all they needed to do is show up and he still would have gotten 60%. Instead, they chose to try to surf on getting all the testing marks with none of the attendance marks.", "Why would OP be included in a Greek life event if they were not a part of the Greek system? My university would have a \u201cGreek study lounge\u201d with snacks and materials that were paid for from a budget that all fraternities and sororities paid into. If someone wasn\u2019t paying in to the system why would they be invited to it? OP is NTA for not sharing their study guide but the Greek study group is completely irrelevant", "I am not saying he is a jerk, but people will probably hold him in that light,, even if it isn't true nor his fault so its irrelevant, it was only an observation.

I had a professor who gave an exam that was too long for anyone to finish. She claimed that some people had finished so it wasn't a problem with the exam.

She found out.", "NTA, this is your work, this is something that you spent a lot of effort and time on.  It is not your fault they did not go to class or even study.  There are a few underlying issues with this as well.

You\u2019ve hopefully taught them all a very important lesson. Good job.", "The person in question got a 67 after making a 200 page study guide\u2026", "That was my thought as well! Find out how many people were in the study group/Greek life group, and charge them $300 per person and refuse to release the notes unless everyone pays!

How so? Those students intentionally sabotaged themselves, and OP had nothing to do with that. It\u2019s one thing to help people who have put in work and use study material from other students to supplement their studying, it\u2019s another to be a freeloader and expect those around you to carry you to a passing grade.", "Was 97% on the final worth 40%.", "They got a 67 on the final that got curved to a 97.

And again, he is not obliged and I am not saying he is, what I am pointing out tho, is that the way he approaches it and the mentality that he has, for me, is terrible.
