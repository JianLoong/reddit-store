I refused to share my final study guide after I found out (a) students were skipping class to bank on memorizing my notes (b) students were helping each other study and not inviting me even when I asked. This caused the final exam grade to be awful and caused multiple students to fail the course.\n\n2.

Well, that particular day in class was like a firing line and only three of us had apparently prepared. Later on I got so much shit from some of my classmates for not preparing notes, which I found hilarious considering we were in frigging *law school*. I stopped giving out notes entirely.

Empathetic people who strive to work hard and prove themselves.  And selfish people who want the attention, the glory and the praise, but don't want to do ANY of the work.  The second type of person will ALWAYS throw a temper tantrum when things don't go their way. (Cause they don't understand the way things work, and don't take the time to learn, and they are frustrated because they don't understand WHY they don't get their way).  (The empathetic person will ALWAYS go into self introspection mode and WONDER if they were in the wrong, even when they know they weren't).  You are going to encounter SO MANY of these people in your working career.  And the BEST thing you can do is NOT enable them or fall for their crap.  You figured out what they were doing and outsmarted them.  Sounds like YOU will go far.  \n\nIf other people want to be known for being smart and nice... then they need to DO smart and nice things.  And not refuse to share the exact same item with you because you are not in \"greek life\".  Good luck to those people...", "NTA\n\nTheir laziness is entirely on them, they could've studied or made their own final guide.\n\nDon't even give it a second thought, you did the right thing.", "LOL.  Your roommate and her cronies failed because they didn't study.  That is on them. Not your problem.\n\nNext time charge for your notes. NTA", "YTA to yourself. You could have sent them the 2 paged \"study guide\" with \";)\" on one page and \":P\" on the other", "NTA\n\nYou made the study guide for yourself. Your classmates did nothing to try to pass.", "Absolutely NTA, for the reasons already stated by previous commenters.\n\nThe only additional thought that crossed my mind is the possibility of you selling your notes to your classmates.  It's not like you were offering the answers to the final exam itself, so I don't think it has any ethical ramifications.  But if they want to profit off of your work, no reason you shouldn't profit at the same time.\n\nHowever, I'm glad you took the approach you did.  Don't let me participate in your little club?  Then why SHOULD I help you?  Well done, OP!", "Nta you didn't cause them the fail. They chose not to attend class and they stop studying for the final. It's on them for not passing", "NTA she lied to you.", "NTA.\n\n'Liberal arts students' slacking. Go figure.", "This!!! NTA", "There was one biology class in university where I walked in and my professor said, \"Congratulations, you got the highest grade in class!\" I was genuinely happy until I got my exam and saw that I had gotten a 74%. That professor did not curve and her passing mark was 75%. It was the midterm, thank God, so we all worked extra hard to make it up after, but I'll never forget the evil glint in her eye when I walked in and she congratulated me.", "NTA. Intro to Chemistry should not be so hard that most of the class fails when the professor is very highly rated.  Didn\u2019t any of these English majors have to take chemistry in high school?\n\nAlso I N F O:  if your roommate is into Greek life, why doesn\u2019t she live at the sorority house?", "The last thing this world needs is people who choose to not do the work for the degree they \u2018earn\u2019. \n\nFuck\u2019em.

They should have put in the same work", "NTA  The moment they excluded you from their study group because \"it is for greeks only\" was the moment when it would became absurd to give them all your work. They could have been in mutual help situation, but they refused it.\n\nBut also, they placed themselves into loosing situation anyway. \"Only memorizing\" is actually harder and leads to worst results then learning for understanding. And my experience from my college is that people who rely on others notes have always worst grades. All the work that goes to creating notes etc is work that makes you learn. It was their own fault through and through.", "They caused themselves to fail. Don\u2019t let anyone else see your study guides etc after this. If they\u2019re not capable of passing classes on their own they should find something else. \n\nNTA", "You should work at preparing teaching aids.", "Not sure what living in Greece has to do with studying chemistry, but from what I can gather NTA. Also struggling to understand how people who can memorize 80 pages of notes could fail an exam.", "Of course you're NTA, and nothing caused them to fail but their own laziness. Congrats on the B+. You earned it--they didn't.", "I'm just reeling from the fact that you created a 200-page study guide and still got a raw score of 67%. I thought you'd have a perfect score-- dang, that exam must've been a beast!

This feels like a great example of \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\" They're all perfectly capable of attending class, taking notes, and studying and instead they chose to bet it all on you being willing to share your guide again. You had no obligation to do so and no prior agreement. On top of that, even after the first guide, they still excluded you from their \"Greek life\" so they wanted all the benefit from your roommate's connection with you without ever actually including you in anything.", "NTA and great job standing up for yourself!\n\nThey f\u2019d around and found out what the consequences were, which is absolutely not your fault. Also, if attendance was 20% of the grade, how dumb were they to not even show up?\n\nI hope you get a better roommate next year. Be wary of retaliation until you move out - guard your valuables and ignore their comments.\n\nA 17% average would usually indicate a terribly written test, I agree, but if most of the students didn\u2019t show up or work during the term, then it could just be their fault."]}
