I refused to share my final study guide after I found out (a) students were skipping class to bank on memorizing my notes (b) students were helping each other study and not inviting me even when I asked. This caused the final exam grade to be awful and caused multiple students to fail the course.\n\n2.

Empathetic people who strive to work hard and prove themselves.  And selfish people who want the attention, the glory and the praise, but don't want to do ANY of the work.

Congrats to the B+", "NTA\u2014their failure to prepare is not your problem.\n\nWhat if you had gotten super sick and couldn\u2019t attend class to get the material for your study guide?  Or what if you just suddenly stopped grasping the material and bombed out?  What was their plan then?", "I would have said \u201cNope, it\u2019s a non \u201cGreek-Life\u201d thing. But I\u2019m petty asf. NTA they should learn to do their own damn work.", "NTA.\nThey wanted to cheat and get good grades on your effort. You put in the work and you are not obligated to share it with anyone else. \nThey failed bc they didn\u2019t attend class or do any work. It\u2019s a good life lesson for them. \nCongrats on getting a B+!", "NTA.\n\nIf they failed the class, it wasn't because of the actions or inactions of you, a fellow student.\n\nYou had no part in this.\n\nThey could have created their own study guides.", "NTA. But pro tip? Recruit people for the study guide the first day of class. Divide the number of chapters by the number of people and assign chapters based on that. Create a shared Dropbox or whatever so people can add their chapter guides for everyone participating to see. \n\nI did this with my cohort when I was in grad school and it worked fairly well. I ran into the same issue of people wanting me to share my guides at the end of the semester. When I told them I worked hours a few people offered to help and it spiraled into this system. \n\nThose who didn\u2019t do their portion got deleted from the dropbox (so they no longer had access to the guides) and I would cover their portion. Some of the guides weren\u2019t as good as I (and the others) liked but it was always few and far between. I spoke with people early on for half assing, because it wasn\u2019t cool to the rest of us, and everyone else got the hint. We all did really well come finals, and I didn\u2019t feel any resentment because I only had to do guides for like 4 chapters instead of 34. Win win!", "Congratulations on your hard work and great grade! Chemistry is a tough language to learn, if it\u2019s not your thing.\nOh and definitely NTA. Be proud of yourself!", "NTA. She and her classmates are lazy and rude. They refused to include you in their study group but they wanted to mooch off your hard work.", "NTA  You didn't cause anyone to fail.  Their lack of effort and attendance (an easy 20% they gave up on) caused them to fail.", "NTA.  Your roommate sucks.", "You didn't cause them to fail. Their laziness and entitlement caused them to fail.\n\nYour roommate had already broken your trust with the previous notes.\n\nNTA - they learned something.", "Ha! NTA. And I\u2019m so proud of you \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, your roommate is an AH though.", "NTA. Also you probably could\u2019ve gotten an A in the class if the first study guide wasn\u2019t shared since I\u2019m sure the curve would\u2019ve been hire for the midterm. You ended up with a higher average since you didn\u2019t share it the second time, like you deserved. Congrats on your hard work and success!", "NTA, obviously.  When I was in college, I took all my lecture notes in shorthand, which none of the other students could read.  I typed my notes and shared them with 3 other students who were all good students and shared their notes with me.  If someone who wasn't working hard in the class wanted to \"borrow\" my notes, I gave them the shorthand lecture notes.", "NTA \u2014 But girl\u2026those study guides are now the easiest part time job you have until you graduate. \n\nIt\u2019s not even cheating since they\u2019re notes. \n\nBonus points if you either upcharge the Greeks or say no.", "NTA. You didn't cause anything that wasn't directly related to you. They stopped paying attention, they stopped attending class, they made the decision to fail. That's not on you.", "NTA.  I bet that in every group project those assholes were free riders on someone else's work.", "NTA\n\nYou did the work.  Congrats on passing.  These other people wanted to coast on YOUR work.  \n\nSkipping class , losing 20% of the grade is a dumb move on their part.\n\nI would never trust your room mate in the future.  I know it is not likely to occur in the future, but she betrayed your trust.", "NTA. Your roommate and classmates could have \"done the right thing\" and showed up to class and actually put in some effort.", "YTA at the end of the day y\u2019all both had struggles for example you both had one parent. Your friend is allowed to talk about how he lost a parent and his struggles whether he was dirt poor or a billionaire he still went through stuff you don\u2019t get to neglect his feelings just because you feel like you went through more you should never ever compare your pain to others it\u2019s hurtful and wrong", "NTA and good for you", "You didn\u2019t cause them to fail. They did it completely on their own by skipping class and not putting in the work. NTA.", "This reeks of mean frat kid energy.", "Also the only people who are to blame for failing are those who failed to study, the entitlement with them is amazing, blame others and take no responsibility.  Ha!", "Getting a 67% on it after clearly doing the work and making a *200* page study guide is also horrible. I'm glad the prof curved up, but dang. That's just ridiculous for an intro basic requirement type class.  I had a bio class like that. The professor was a recent graduate and had been a science major and it was her first class to teach. She didn't understand that pretty much everyone in the class was taking it because we had to do an intro level science class. I made a 50-70 page front and back study guide like op did, attended every class and did the readings. I still got a similar or lower result to OP.  I don't think she curved our results though. But it backfired in the end as it was her first year teaching and her professor review sheets were horrible. Some people were vicious in their ratings. I think they made her change how she did stuff after that.", "Lol they stopped showing up. What grade do you expect if you stop showing up and don't do the work?", "If half the class didn\u2019t go to class then I am unsurprised", "Greeks can purchase it for the low price of $50 each", "Damn. I really wish OP would\u2019ve said this!", "This. And also there's no study guide in the world that magically will allow you to pass a class. Especially chemistry. I mean, there always a book. \n\nCome to it, if it's such a great study guide she should sell it. Chem 101 for dummies. Oh wait it probably already exists.\n\nAnyways, they didn't fail because of a lack of study guide.\n\nEdit: and a 17% on the final with a 5.0 professor from ratemyprof. This didn't happen at all as written here.", "So well said.", "English oldie here, what\u2019s \u201dGreek life\u201d?", "it looks to me like the roommate maybe promised that guide to everybody. because otherwise it would be just so dumb to rely on a not yet existing study guide to pass your class and not even go there anymore", "And chemistry should have had labs.  To get a grade that doesn\u2019t include anything from lab work sounds like a load of shit", "Sororities and fraternities on campus.", "People who are in sororities and fraternities. Because the names of them are Greek letters.", "Fraternities and sororities.", "I bet the roommate took credit for writing the first guide, too. It's hard to imagine the entire group being dumb enough to count on someone they don't know writing them a second study guide.", "My hope is that the roommate promises and took favours from others in leu of the second study guide being passed on, so now she\u2019s hit doubly hard not only causing them to fail, but also now she owes many peoples favours/money back because she couldn\u2019t deliver. I love karma. \n\nOP, definitely NTA, and we\u2019ll done for passing with such a high grade!", "Wouldn't they be living in a Greek house and not with a non-Greek member?", "I thought the same about the roommate taking credit. But there\u2019s definitely a chance they really *were* dumb enough lol. Most of the folks I knew in college who were deep enough into Greek Life that they wouldn\u2019t let other people join study groups, attend parties, etc. weren\u2019t the brightest bulbs in the box. \n\n(I know plenty of awesome people who were involved in GL; I\u2019m referring to the gatekeep-y, \u201cbetter-than-you-because-I-paid-to-join-a-club\u201d types.)", "My old college town in Western PA didn't have sorority houses because G-d forbid groups of women live together off campus.  I think it was the thought a \\*shudder\\* *brothel* might be run under the guise of being a sorority. /s\n\nDunno if that blue law ever got off the books.", "You don\u2019t have to live in a Greek house to be a member. You can ,but it\u2019s not a requirement typically.", "Depends on the university. My university had no greek housing. So people joined greeks but lived in regular dorms.", "Not all chapters can afford/want to have a house. When I was an undergrad, neither of the sororities on campus had one because property was really expensive (no one wanted to pay that much in dues) and no one wanted to deal with the rules around having a house."]}
