I wonder if she is trying to respect my space by not making me feel stressed about having to be included in planning yet I feel more stressed being left out of the planning! \n\nHusband is killing it with his boundaries these days and has clearly stated to his parents that we likely won\u2019t attend given we have a baby on the way.

Husband\u2019s parents are late 70\u2019s-80\u2019s and MIL says we should be spending time with them on these important holidays as they are aging. We have said they can meet the baby for a couple hours on Christmas Day instead. She continues to push, though, for this formal Christmas Eve dinner in addition.\n\nFor context: MIL has historically antagonized and vilified me and thus, both my husband and my own mom have said to not involve myself/stay out of it since she will just vilify and blame me again if I do email her or say something directly. Letting my husband deal with her was my initial intention but she continues to bulldoze and push him. There is a part of me that wants to directly tell her she is being unreasonable and inconsiderate and to let it go. \n\nAre we the A**holes for not wanting to attend this formal dinner?

You are starting a family, so your core family changes.\n\nSecond of all, 1-4 wks post partum can mean anything: you could still be wearing these matrass-sized pads between your legs; you may still have to pee in the shower; the baby is still very fragile; you may be struggling with breastfeeding and infections; perhaps no formal clothing fits you yet - nobody knows and it makes sense to not make wild plans for that period of time.\n\nYou don't have to suck up anything.", "Even if you deliver as early as end of November, the baby would only be about a month old on Christmas Eve.

No. She\u2019s laying on the guilt because of her age, but this would be a year where she (at best) offered a low-key at home dinner or even just offered to bring by a Christmas Eve meal and gifts without pressuring you.

Maybe in their day they didn't GAF about a new mom's well being and think it's fine to \"suck it up\" when that's just wrong to demand of others.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is so far removed from her child rearing days she's clearly forgotten what it's like after having a child. I can't imagine how anyone would want to dress up and drag a less than month old baby to a fancy restaurant.

Set those boundaries and remember that \"no\" is a complete sentence. You don't need to justify saying no to her.

Your MIL is being completely unreasonable.\n\nJust let your husband continue to do the heavy lifting, but stress to him that under no uncertain terms will you be going if he caves to the mother-pressure.\n\nWe didn't leave the house for 2 months after our first was born, my wife was extremely sore, took her 2-3 weeks just to be able to move around without serious pain. Going to a fancy restaurant? GTFO with that nonsense.\n\nThe biggest issue here is that your husband is, as yet, unaware what he's in for. He likely thinks that it might not be that big of a deal and if you're closer to end of November than Christmas, that you'll be able to figure it out. Respectfully, he has no idea what he's getting into (I sure didn't), and I think he will extremely quickly figure out that going for a high-end dinner with his folks just isn't that high on his priority list.\n\nAt this point, I might even just wait until the baby is born and then, when your world is upside down and you're just trying to survive, he'll know and it'll be pretty easy to say, yeah no, we're not coming, and if you cared about my family at all, you would be hosting a dinner at your house so that we didn't have to do a single thing as brand-new parents.\n\nEdit: my daughter was born just 6 days before Easter. Once I knew the date, I told my parents hey, this year, we're having a baby really close to Easter, so we may or may not be there, we may or may not be on time, we may or may not be able to contribute a dessert or something, we just don't know, and they went \"we totally understand! we will do everything and clean up everything, you guys just come and go when you need to cause you have a new baby!\", because they are rational and understanding humans.", "NTA. Your husband has already told her y'all aren't coming and why so there's no need to keep repeating yourselves. Ignore all further comments and communicate about it.", "NTA\n\nAnd I would withdraw the option to see the new baby on Christmas day.  Your MIL pushes because she gets rewarded for doing so.  You need to change that dynamic.", "NTA - I think the issue your husband is running into is that he is trying to convince his mother to be happy about the boundaries you two are setting. It is 100% ok for her to be mad/upset/annoyed by your boundaries - as long as she respects them. He needs to be more clear and he needs to refuse to debate. \n\nHusband - \"Mom, we are not going to attend a formal dinner on Christmas eve. I know we have alternated Christmas's for the past (however many) years and this is supposed to be your year, but things are going to change now that we are having a baby. This year is obviously going to be the most different, since we will be in the very early stages of caring for a newborn. We can discuss whether we will be available to see you for a short visit on Christmas eve or Christmas day this year once the baby is here, but we are not going to commit to or even continue discussing plans for Christmas until the baby arrives.\" \n\nAnd that is it. He needs to shut down any further attempts by her to discuss Christmas plans. If she needs a headcount for whatever she is planning - he can tell her to count you/him/baby out of it. If she says she is trying to come up with something that will accommodate a new baby - he needs to tell her to make whatever plans she wants, and you/him will decide if it works for you once baby is here. \n\nI suggest that you avoid contacting her. Everything else aside - it sets up a separate stream of communication and that is not going to be productive.", "NTA..\n\nI really wanna say NAH as they are being fairly considerate by getting s private dining area and all that... but going out to eat on Xmas eve is automatic AH territory.. sorry in-laws.", "Oh heck no should you give in!!  You won\u2019t physically have recovered by then and you will be sleep deprived and worn out.   The first few months are wonderful and yet the most exhausting time of your life.   They should be pampering you by dropping off food and letting you guys rest and bond as new family.", "NTA. Your MIL is definitely TA. Ok - first of all, assuming the delivery goes absolutely smoothly, you\u2019re likely not going to even want to step outside for a week. Your body is still going to be in disarray.

You aren't obligated to handle anything. Just show up. It sounds like you don't feel like going. If that's true, at least be honest about your reason and proceed from there.

No one really knows when this baby is coming and it doesn't really matter. You don't want to go (which you have many legit reasons not to), you don't go. You let her know that you declined the invite which is polite and then now you simply don't go. Don't let them guilt you or force you to do anything you don't want to do.

I\u2019m in the same position- due early December so baby could realistically be here any time from mid-November to mid-December. We told people basically as soon as we knew the due date that Thanksgiving and Christmas were off the table for us, and I\u2019m thankful they\u2019ve understood. Your MIL should recognize how ridiculous it is to expect your as young as 4 day old baby to attend a dinner, especially in a public space! Not to mention that you\u2019ll have, you know, just given birth and won\u2019t be feeling the best.", "NTA.\n\nTo let you know you aren't alone, a similar situation is happening with my ILs. It's a blended family, and the first to have a child is overdue. The youngest is getting married in October. There's potential that the wedding with be childfree, and they expect someone to attend without their 1.5 month old. Apparently because my MIL did that when she was a new mom, that means everyone is supposed to be comfortable doing that. There's been a lot of \"it's a wedding! it only happens once! family must put each other first!\" type statements. \n\nLeave it your husband to deal with his parents. But perhaps suggest to him that the best response is short and sweet: \"sorry, that doesn't work for us\".", "You could always make it real simple by putting restrictions out there and just tell them these are the doctors rules due to the amount of sickness transmitted around the holidays and the babies very new immune system. No traveling,  no public places, no visitors without masks, no holding or kissing baby without current Tdap vaccine, etc Just be as severe as possible so when you ease back a little you aren't actually giving up a real boundary. I'm sure you doctor will even pen you a \"list\" if you ask nicely", "NTA. But you are idiots if you commit to any plans in December, or even January. Who knows how how it will go? You may be on bed rest, you may be bouncing around full of energy, you may be up feeding every 2 hours, you may need a c section, you may be getting 8 hrs sleep every night, you may have stitches and not want to be sitting down! But my guess would be that you will be tired, sore, still working out how to handle everything including feeding, and in no fit state to be going to a restaurant, even if you wanted to expose a newborn to that amount of germs and risk, or even expose the other people at the restaurant to a new born!\n\nAll the best, but explain the realities of a newborn to your husband, point out its in no one\u2019s best interest to go, and get him to deal with his mother as you do not need the additional stress of this hanging over you.", "If your husband is sticking up for you, I see no reason for you to involve yourself more with your MIL's antics.  From the outside it seems more stressful to be involved.  Just have him say, thanks for the invitation, we won't be attending this year.  Full stop.  Shut down any future discussion.  In the future, I assume he'll run any planning by you and you can either agree or not and he'll convey the decision.  Don't let her take up more space than necessary.  Say no and move on with your lives.  And congrats on your pregnancy.", "NTA - to not want to make plans for any time around your birthing date. Perfectly understandable. \n\nIf I was you though I would just let hubby deal with his mother. Even though I know the drive to handle it yourself is strong you said he has been killing it so let him do his thing. Now and in the future. If he does it then he is the villian.", "NTA - Even with your dream delivery it will likely leave you somewhat fragile, tired, bleeding (yes, a lot of blood leaks for many days after delivery, you'll have to wear large pads) and unwilling to spend long hours with a woman who vilify you. And the baby will be just days old, this is your first baby, you need time to adjust and learn breastfeeding (if you are into it) and just in general learn everything there is to know about your baby. I would not commit to anything outside the house for the first month post partum.\n\nThat being said, I would let BF deal with it because you risk her telling everyone she's such a victim of you refusing to let her see the baby, etc. I would prepare a sentence with BF and have him repeat it over and over. Just one sentence, not tring to give a different explanation each time. \"We don't know how things will be then and don't want to commit.\"", "NTA.  And leave it to your husband to deal with her. Make sure he is strong on his boundaries.  If she pushes, he can tell her she is close to losing the time she will have.  If you get involved, it will lead to a bigger fight than is necessary.  Tell hubby to shut her down.  If she continues to bring it up, he can hang up/walk away.", "NTA, but go one step further- if they say anything negative about you not spending *this* Christmas with them, then there will not be any future Christmases either.  \n\nBTW, a child can't learn to respect their parent is that parent is being vilified by another role model in their life. I'd strongly encourage threatening to cut her off if she so much as sneezes at you.", "NTA\u2026your husband needs to just say it will not be happening.
