My sister clearly doesn't feel that I am right and she has expressed that I was telling her how to parent/didn't think she could parent and maybe by telling her what to do I came across that way. Could I have said things better? I think maybe. Could I be the asshole for this?

You're looking at it from the outside, so you can see things that she can't or won't admit to right now. Let your niece know that you're here if she ever needs a safe space to talk. Also, encourage both her & your sister to talk because clearly there's something going on & I suspect you nailed on the head exactly what it is.", "NTA. Your sister is probably acting out coz you hit a nerve. Let it pass, let your sister and niece know that you\u2019re there if any of them need to talk and just leave it at that. \n\nI do agree with you they should talk, but if your sister doesn\u2019t want to do it now, it\u2019s best to let it rest than to create more friction.", "NTA- That makes perfect sense and your sister sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of her actions so she is denying the issue entirely.", "NTA. Your sister sounds pretty defensive even though what you said is a very plausible reason. And if she talks to your niece then she might be able to clear it up. Sounds like there's some festering resentment in your sister's family that she's not willing to face.", "NTA but your sister is. She knew EXACTLY what her daughter was upset about, and she passively aggressively told her that if her father miraculously came back, she would not get back together with him. And then had the audacity to say she doesn't know why her daughter is upset. WOW. Your sister is a piece of work.", "NTA. Considering your sister inexplicably didn\u2019t realize how such a subject matter could affect her daughter, nor that she has any need to talk to her after you suggested it, pretty much solidifies that she has unlikely handled her feelings about all of this all along.", "NTA! I am appalled that your sister could not think of this herself, she must be pretty self absorbed to not think of this as soon as that scene happened.", "NTA.\n\nDid your sister somehow skip being a teenager? A 15 year old wouldnt be \"petty\"? Even setting aside that the experience of a parent dying as a child is a far more significant event than being just a petty complaint, yes EVERY 15 year old is going to be petty & overly emotional about something at some point. Its part of being a teenager.\n\nIf your niece is still angry weeks later it is obviously important to her, and your sister ignoring the cause just seems selfish. Obviously you cant force your sister to parent a certain way, but if she brought it up to you theres no reason for you not to point out the obvious.", "NTA\n\nThe mother should be talking to the daughter about things like that and probably should have thought about the film choice.\n\nI think it's great that you are a supportive Aunt/Uncle but as you said you don't replace the parent in this situation. You should be an additional source of support rather than the only source.", "NTA Your sister initiated the conversation about her daughter and then got mad when you also spoke. It wasn\u2019t wrong to assume she wanted your input since she opened the conversation with you. Your input obviously struck a nerve with her and she\u2019s upset with you about it.
