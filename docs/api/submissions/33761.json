It wasn\u2019t that hard because I had many people that helped me. I managed to get away from my terrible home life and never looked back.\n\nBecause of reasons, I no longer talked to my mom and younger brother (he\u2019s now 18). I mostly hate my dad but my mom having no backbone upset me and my brother is just like our dad sometimes so I just wanted a fresh start. \n\nBut a few weeks ago my friend\u2019s mom contacted me saying that my brother\u2019s been kicked out of the house and asked if I\u2019d be willing to take him in. She wasn\u2019t mean/upfront about it, but she just didn\u2019t want to deal with his attitude and felt I\u2019d be a better fit for him. \n\nI was hesitant but my boyfriend (22) said \u201cof course he should live with us\u201d so I called her and well I regret it. Terribly. \n\nThe first few days were fine but then he started to get mad at everything. He\u2019s even wrecked several of my boyfriend\u2019s paintings and art supplies during his meltdowns. My boyfriend is a really nice person and is far more generous than I am. He keeps telling me it\u2019s okay and that all the stuff he broke is replaceable and that nothing matters more than my brother\u2019s well being. He\u2019s right, but it still pisses me off. I\u2019m sorry but it does.\n\nI was out with some friends and came home to the house being a mess again and my boyfriend cleaning it up while my brother locked himself in his room. I already knew what happened and I was literally so annoyed. I started banging on my brother\u2019s door till he opened it and I just told him that he can disrespect me all he wants, but my boyfriend is probably the only person left in this world that has any hope for him. There\u2019s a reason he keeps being kicked out of places and if it weren\u2019t for my boyfriend, he\u2019d probably be on the streets right now. \n\nMy brother stormed out of the house after calling me a fucking bitch and only came home after my boyfriend found him. He no longer speaks to me and doesn\u2019t even look me in the eye. Fair enough. But my boyfriend is upset with me too and keeps saying that I fucked up. He says that I don\u2019t need to speak for him and that he knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s acting normally for the most part but there\u2019s a lot of tension now and we mostly just talk regarding my brother.

The brother should have been out the moment he started breaking things.", "NTA. You are acting out of self-preservation. It's instinctive, the really primitive part of the brain that senses danger and doesn't want it near. So you fire up.\n\nYour boyfriend has good intentions but is not keeping you safe. He has brought chaos into your home again. While your brother might need assistance, being with you restarts all the old bad behaviours. You need to be apart. \n\nYour boyfriend is a decent human being. Unfortunately he is making things worse, not better. His priority as your boyfriend is you. He has forgotten that.", "YTA, lightly, you took him in, which is good. But, words hurt, he needs to hear that his sister, who lived through what he's lived through and thrived, has hope for him. I'm sure he feels hopeless right now. He needs professional help. Speak kindly, be real, set expectations, set boundaries, set consequences, but no hurtful words. Speak your feelings, it will help him speak his too.", "NTA. Your bf is a saint. But Bro isn't just disrespecting bf and destroying bf's stuff, he's utterly disturbing the peace and safety of the house. So you are speaking for yourself too when you speak truth to your nasty brother. Maybe BF has some sort of saviour complex that he can \"save\" bro... But BF is now part of the problem... when is bro going to learn to behave if someone somewhere always covers up for him? You did f up, but only when you said \"you can disrespect me all you want...\" Why would you say that?   No, stand up for yourself, against both of these idiots. One for being a complete arse, the other for covering up for him.", "Next time he has a mental breakdown and starts trashing stuff - call the police.

Only reason why he called you a bitch and got angry is because he doesn\u2019t want to face that reality.\n\nYour boyfriend is a saint. Wanting to see the good in him and wanting to help him. But he is failing to realise your brother can\u2019t be helped unless he changes his attitude.

I am with you 100% on this one. You have seen this play before, with your mother having no backbone and your father rolling over her. In my eyes, your bf is enabling him to act this way, He is teaching him that every time he fucks up, he can play the \"difficult childhood\" card (not saying you guys didn't have one). He can break stuff, scream, shout (and let it all out) and still feel entitled to your house money and love.\n\nIf you truly care about a child it is IMPERATIVE that you teach them manners boundaries and discipline. Loving someone is not about giving them whatever they want, or else they will throw a tantrum. That is how spoiled brats are raised. Your bf needs to grow a backbone, the one your mother didn't have.", "Your boyfriend is very forgiving and compassionate, perhaps too polite, but your brother has serious behavioral problems.  Destroying your boyfriend's things is not okay and it seems to me that he is taking advantage of it because your boyfriend allows it.\n\n  You shouldn't have spoken for your boyfriend, but you should have told your brother that YOU don't tolerate disrespect in your home.\n\n  The fact is, you and your boyfriend need to be on the same side and set limits and rules for your brother, come to an agreement, and then talk to your brother.  If he doesn't accept the rules, alas, that's the door.", "NTA but you shouldnt have taken him in. in fact you should kick him out. if your parents dont wanna deal with their own child why do you have to? you should kick him out and forget about it", "You need to get bro out of the house. Even then it sounds like bro already screwed your relationship. Your bf is choosing your bro. It's done.NTA", "Agree.   OP is focused on the wrong issue, and BF cares more about the human than the things. \n\nOP your brother is in serious need of therapy,  as are you to a lessor extent.\n\nWhatever effed up background your family creates is toxic and your bro doesn't have tools to handle it. Focus on that. \n\nNAH", "The relationship is not over. But OP needs to communicate, ideally away from the house, with her BF on why she needs to put herself first. \n\nSome people have this notion of unconditional love within a family and those people often come from happy homes. \n\nMaybe the OP could go stay with friends for a little while. If the BF thinks he can make progress with the brother he can have a go, but she needs space away from the trauma-triggering abusive behaviour her brother is repeating."]}
