From what I understand they sometimes feel more like a boy and sometimes feel more like a girl. Yesterday was their 12th birthday and my husband and I wanted to do something special for them to also celebrate their new identity. My husband came up with the genius idea to have two birthday parties at the same time in our house, one for the boys and one for the girls, and our son could move freely between these two parties based on how they feel. At the end everyone would gather together to celebrate our son's birthday.\n\nWe invited all of their friends for a surprise party, but didn't tell them about the theme to keep it a secret. We made our first floor the \"boys floor\" and the second floor the \"girls floor\". For the boys floor we had some table games and game consoles, and for the girls floor we invited two makeup artists. Both floors had snacks, drinks and appropriate decorations and music. When the friends came, I had them all waiting in our garden. My husband was responsible for bringing our son. However, after my husband came with our son and we explained the theme of the party to everyone, my son started to cry and locked themselves in their room. Only after we talked to them we realized that they haven't came out to their friends yet and we basically outed them in front of everyone in \"the most humiliating way\" according to them. They also said that our idea was stupid. We tried to make them go out of their room but to no avail, and eventually we had to cancel the party and let everyone go.\n\nMy son still doesn't want to talk to us, and I think we might have screwed up big time.

You had a golden opportunity to put all of the birthday activities on the one floor and celebrate the fact that makeup, gaming, music, and foods + drink are all genderless/genderfull activities.

Yikes yikes yikes.)", "YTA just because your a girl doesn't mean you can't like table games and computer games. I am a girl and play DnD various computer games and all and I don't care about make up.

YTA", "YTA. Ouch. You meant well so there\u2019s that.", "Are they comfortable being called your son? That gendered language was the first red flag. (Not to invalidate their identity if they are okay with it, but it seems like these parents are clueless.)\n\nI'm not even going to get into chewing you out for outing them, which was literally the worst thing you could possibly do. Even if they were out to everyone, this party was a terrible idea. Gender-segregated events are notoriously difficult for nonbinary people because they literally don't belong in either of those spaces. because, you know. they are NOT part of the BINARY.\n\nYTA.

Sometimes (every time?) parents just don't \"understand.\" But throwing a party, that's out of the love for your child even if it's not quite right. I never had a party at all. I think it'd be cool to have multiple themes.", "You meant well but YTA-\n\nYour child is 12. You should have asked them before doing this. It's also not your right to out them.", "YTA. Not only did you out your *child*, you also did go big on gender stereotypes by enforcing cliches for the party. Videogames for boys and makeup for the girls? C\u2019mon. I\u2019m pretty sure most of the kids would have been more happy to not be separated for no reason and have a celebration with all of their friends regardless of their gender.", "YTA. Ouch. You absolutely screwed up. Your poor kid \ud83d\udc94", "YTA - The party wasn't for your kid. Clearly.\n\nYou basically used your kid as an excuse to throw a party that showcases how cool and tolerant and virtuous you are.\n\nYour title says you outed them, yet you still needed to post.\n\nYou thoughtlessly threw your kid under the schoolbus while pretending to be an ally. (Allies don't out people).\n\n\nBeyond all of that, did it occur to you that it's a pretty shitty host that ignores their guests half the time...  There was no version of reality in which this surprise party could be a good idea.", "YTA. I think you were well intentioned. But you blew it in terms of execution. In so many ways. \nFirst, non-binary doesn\u2019t mean multi-personality where one is male one moment and female the next. \nSecondly, non-binary people struggle with social settings or facilities that are based on gender- e.g. restrooms and locker rooms that are divided by gender. Because they don\u2019t identify as either- which one is going to be appropriate or more comfortable for them, etc. \nso consider the context of having a party where you divide people by gender. \n\nYour child may be struggling to understand themselves right now. So I get that it may be hard for you to understand everything. I encourage you to seek support from a therapist who is experienced and supportive of those with gender-related questions/concerns.", "YTA.

You outed a 12 year-old in front of all their friends without consulting them first. Don't ever do that. They are the only one who gets to decide when, how, or even if, it ever happens.

Okay.\n\nEDIT: YTA!!!!!!!", "So, you outed your child without permission, you segregated people by your perception of their gender, and you forced them into your stereotype of \"gender appropriate\" activities based on that perception.

I wouldn't call you guys assholes because considering you're just as new to this revelation as your child , it's understandable as to your adjustment. The party was in good faith & I saw a comment where you stated that you're new to this. You should've really spoke about it with them first because speaking from experience, not everyone comes out to their friends first before the family. I can see it wasn't your intention to purposely out them. Just give them a few days, and let them come to you when they're ready. This is a very big deal in their life right now & chances are they're feeling alone. Don't fully remove yourself , but rather do more research on what being Nonbinary is & take it from there...with that being said, NAH", "Oml yta", "Yta \n\nOmg so much", "Oof. Yeahhhhh, YTA.", "YTA a non-gendered party that doesn\u2019t mention gender or do anything to acknowledge the gender binary would be better and wouldn\u2019t have outed your child.

Holy shot do some research next time. Also \u201cmy son my son my son my son\u201d cut the shit. Do some research.", "YTA.  If you want to regain your child's trust, you need to seriously educate yourselves on what it means to be nonbinary, because the \"fun party\" you came up with is a **fundamental misunderstanding** of what it means to be nonbinary.  Each \"party\" you threw was a **complete reinforcement** of the gender binary and all the stereotypes that come with it.  If your child doesn't completely identify with either category of girl/boy, why would you host a party that *separates* everyone by gender?  This truly does not make sense and it is **not** genius in any way.  *Please* change your perspective that this party was even a good idea in the first place.  \n\nThis doesn't even touch on the fact that you outed your child to everyone.  Again, I think this boils down to your total unawareness of what it means to be nonbinary or queer.  You can apologize to your child now, but until you make a real effort to educate yourselves about the queer community and nonbinary folks, you're going to continue to make uninformed assumptions that hurt them.", "ESH your son should\u2019ve told you he hasn\u2019t told other people yet. You should\u2019ve asked your son if the theme was okay.", "If I were your child I would disown you.", "YTA.\n\n>Son\n\nIf your child is NB, why do you keep calling then your \"son\"? Also, have y\u2019all even considered asking if they came out to anyone else yet? You just jumped to the conclusion and outed them?\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t see the comment made, they are ok with being called son. Still, you\u2019re TA for outing them\n\nOk I got it, I made a mistake. I never met and heard of someone that young coming out.", "I get that you had good intentions, and I get how this seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't. Obviously enough judgement has been passed, so I'm not going to do that or call you names, but your child is right to be upset about you outing them without consulting them first. They will almost certainly lose friends over this when those friends' parents find out and forbid the friends from seeing your child; they're probably not ready for that. Also, at this age, plenty of those friends will have heard awful things at home and will repeat them to your child because most 11 and 12yos are still just parroting their parents on most things, even if they themselves don't care or know they don't agree with their parents.\n\nApart from that, the idea is pretty cringey. Genderfluidity (which sounds like what your child is experiencing) doesn't mean I'd be comfortable going between two sex-segregated rooms for the length of a party. For me, and many people, it means my gender feelings are different in different situations. For others, the change is on a scale of weeks or months, not minutes or hours. For other nonbinary people, it means they don't go between the two, but they are neither, totally outside the boxes, and thus a segregated party would feel very isolating and point-missing. It's possible that's what your child feels like. At the age of just-turned-12, it's very unlikely they're able to fully articulate how they feel and what they are, and it will probably be years before they can because the language for trans experiences just doesn't really exist, it's much more of a learning process to figure out how to talk about it.\n\nThis idea would have been much better, honestly, if it wasn't segregated. Have makeup artists and game consoles in the same room/same floor/whatever, and let EVERYONE move between activities that interest them -- I guarantee you there was at least one girl in that group who'd rather play video games, and one boy who wants to learn about makeup.\n\nI'm glad you're accepting. Your support and love is going to matter more than anything else in the coming years. But you're going to need to take your son's cues on what kind of support they need from you. Don't try so hard, you know? Just listen and keep loving them.", "YTA not only did you out your child to their friends, some thing they were not ready to do yet, but in planning a party for a non-binary child, you leaned in so heavy to gender stereotypes. You separated the boys and the girls, and gave the boys games and the girls make up. I don\u2019t even know what to say.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It definitely sounds like the kind of thing that would embarrass a preteen child.\n\nI want to add that you seem to be trying to support your child, and that's great. Please keep doing that. But also know that they're still figuring themselves out. Your child may have fully figured out their identity already, or they may get to know themselves a little better as they age and determine that they have a different gender identity. Your support is really important, and making sure you don't judge your child. I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that this is \"just a phase\" or anything like that. This is your child's path to figuring themselves out, whether it is the end or a stop along the way. It takes plenty of people well into their teenage years or even adulthood to properly understand their sexuality and their gender, and your child may come to realize that another identity (maybe a term they didn't know yet or didn't fully understand) describes them better. \n\nWhen I was a little older than your child, quite a few of my friends were still processing their gender and/or sexuality. I've had friends come out as nonbinary and they had things all figured out young, because they just knew. Others realized later on they were transgender, or that they didn't identify with either gender (no gender rather than both genders), or that they were cisgender but either their sexuality or their level of traditional masculinity or femininity didn't match up with what they thought society expected a man or a woman to be. \n\nMy point is, whatever your child is feeling and however they are currently identifying is valid, but it's OK if they don't have it all figured out at 12. If they tell you in a few years or even a few weeks that they realized they identify differently, continue supporting them. Let them take the lead on how they want that support to look and how public they want it to be.", "YTA. Non binary can include feeling like neither, you basically gave your child a party that would make them 100% excluded from their own event. This was a traumatic experience for them.\n\nI can tell you love your child and want to be supportive but you and your husband have a lot of learning (and a lot of making up) to do. \n\nI just hope they\u2019ll be okay\u2026", "YTA, Wow, instead of asking maybe a non binary person for advice on what to do, you come up with this crazy idea. This is next level dumb.", "YtA. Unbelievable that you thought this was acceptable", "YTA but gently. I think you were coming from a good place and trying to be supportive but didn't do the research on what NB means.  You also should have clarified with your kid if they were out to the world yet.  You should have a heart to heart with your kid and genuinely apologize and communicate that you love and support them and want to do anything in your power to make them feel your support and love in a safe environment.", "YTA. Is this real? Worst parenting ever. Did you throw a party for a straight kid celebrating that they were straight? No. So why would this be a good idea?", "YTA and terrible parent.", "I am gonna go against the grain here. NTA\n\nYou had all the right intentions of trying to be supportive. But you need a hellofa lot more research under your belt. \n\nCorrect terms for them, correct understanding of nonbinary, etc. \n\nBut I think above all else just the assumption that they came out to you last was..... dumb. \n\nBut yeah I'd say NAH just very misguided.", "This is one of those times you should have come to reddit first. Ask for advice on experiences, would have stopped this. You live and you learn but now you have major damage control to do", "This is just dumb as dirt.", "YTA \n\nI mean you tried and tried hard but it is like if your sad because someone died and your dog brings you his toy...\n\nLike you tried but it was so out of touch I can't even fathom ot", "You messed up but you did it out of love for your child. Parenting is hard, but one day they will realize how much you love them.", "You were trying to be supportive i get it but you did it in a bad way you outed them to friends and family before they were ready and then made it weird by seperating genders they feel like both so seperating it was weird having a gender neutral party would've been a better idea", "I think you get that YTA by this point. However, I do want to give some advice as a nonbinary person. You do seem to be generally trying to accept and support your child. I applaud you for your acceptance, a lot of parents do a lot worse. \n\nThe nonbinary experience varies from person to person. Your description of nonbinary \u201csometimes feel more like a boy and sometimes feel more like a girl\u201d is not necessarily incorrect but still defines your child\u2019s identity by the gender binary. I\u2019d define nonbinary as not fitting within either binary gender. I\u2019d say that your description better fits genderfluid. Though your child\u2019s personal identity and how they describe themselves is ultimately up to them. \n\nOverall,  I\u2019d recommend trying to stop describing your child by relating their identity to being like or feeling like a \u201cgirl\u201d or a \u201cboy\u201d. For example, you may want to describe them acting or feeling like a \u201cboy\u201d at a certain point in time because they are playing video games. There is nothing inherently masculine about video games. That association is based on our binary societal norms. These norms are hard to unlearn but I think doing so will help you understand your child better. \n\nYour definition of nonbinary, being part girl and part boy, shows through in how you hosted this party. You centered this party around gender stereotypes and the binary gender dichotomy. Try to stop centering their identity, and your worldview in general, within the binary gender norms, because they identify outside of it. I know this can be hard to wrap your head around. \n\nI also want to address that you outed them to their friends. They are 12 years old. That is old enough to be involved in planning their party. If you had involved them in the planning, this whole thing could have been avoided. I know they are not talking to you right now but I would stress working on your communication about this topic in the future. The fact that you did not know that they were not out to any of their friends but presumed to know what kind of party they would want and who they would want to invite is alarming. \n\nComing out is incredibly scary. Being nonbinary is incredibly scary, especially if you are in America right now. If you want to help your child be happy and safe you need to protect them. Who they want to come out to is their decision. It\u2019s a deeply personal decision but it\u2019s also a safety concern. Coming out to the wrong person can get them killed. Again they are 12, which means they are old enough to know who they are and make some decisions for themselves. It also means they are still a kid, your job is to guide them. Make sure they can be themselves, come out to people they care about, and keep themself safe. In this case, you violated their privacy and you don\u2019t necessarily know if there was a reason that they did not want certain friends (or their parents) to know that they are nonbinary. \n\nOverall, I really hope you don\u2019t get discouraged by this comment section. I do think you are trying to be a good parent to your child and accept/understand them. You messed up majorly in this instance. I hope you understand that and going forward you can make amends to your child and do better in the future. I send you and your family my love and hope.", "Hope you set aside some $$ for therapy, y\u2019all have done a number on this poor kid. good god", "I don't  even  know  why  people  are  telling  you your  heart  is in the right  place, there is absolutely  nothing  showing that.\n\nYta.", "YTA. \n\nI'm happy your child is able to express their identity as non binary. \n\nHowever you and your husband are clearly a breeding ground for scaring someone away from their gender. Have you always pushed so many gender tropes at them? Being truly non binary is not a defect and should be accepted. However there are people in my life who have identified non binary then later identified as their bio gender because they realized their parents were pushing tropes on them. My cousin says she's happy to be a woman, she just thought growing up that being a woman had to mean she liked fashion and dolls, and she was a basketball star in our town and liked to race 4 wheelers, etc. So she identified as non binary for a year, thinking it was what she had to do. Her parents did the same stuff you seem to do. \n\nNot only did you ruin your child coming out in their own good time. You proceeded to force gender norms in a bunch of other children! Is this what you thought your child wanted? Is this truly what you thought all those kids would want? Are you SURE all those kids would want to be gender labeled when your own child is trying to tell you they do not? \n\nThis was such a giant fail.

Children of all genders can have friends of all genders.  Enby means there is no gender binary, and you just created one at the party by segregating \"girls\" and \"boys\"\n\nYuck.  YTA.  Apologize profusely and do MUCH MUCH MUCH better.", "JFC, you outed your kid!  You NEVER, EVER do something like that unless you\u2019re ABSOLUTELY, UNDENIABLY, POSITIVELY SURE they\u2019re out publicly.  Of course they don\u2019t want to talk to you!

There are going to be a lot of growing pains over the next few years trying to establish which things are okay and which ones aren\u2019t. Honestly, at least your trying and although you definitely missed the mark your intent was pure and one of acceptance. Life is about learning, next time someone you know has a trans kid you can inform them of what mistakes you made and how not to repeat them. Everyone acts like everything is so obvious, it\u2019s not, people have no clue what things people have and haven\u2019t been exposed to so cut people some slack every once in a while.", "I mean, if my kid said they were non binary at age 12 I'd do my best to let this change as little as possible. If they still say this about themselves at age 18, fine, but no way do I just accept that a 12 yr old knows what tf they are yet", "Son is reserved for children who identify as male. They are your child now, not your son.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, outing your child can have dangerous consequences.\n\nDid either of you ever even stop to TALK to your kid about they wanted? Like even once?\n\nYTA", "Are you Tucker Carlson?", "My jaw actually dropped... YTA. You should have at the very least asked them first, for god's sake. Outing someone without their explicit consent is never okay because the fact of the matter is, you don't know who they're already out to - especially in the case of a trans child! It can be anywhere from embarrassing to dangerous for other kids and faculty at school to find out a kid is trans/nonbinary.\n\nThere is also the matter of the party theme itself, which shows that you fundamentally do not understand what it means to be nonbinary. This is normal, because we are not raised to consider any experiences outside of the binary, but it is something you now need to learn for your child.\n\nPlease allow me, a nonbinary adult, to shed a little light on the situation for you.\n\nI'll be the first to say that there is limitless beauty, joy, creativity, courage, culture, community, healing, love, and life in being nonbinary. However, there are also very real challenges and oppression we face.\n\nBeing nonbinary can be a very lonely, alienating, or even dangerous experience because so many aspects of social life are unnecessarily yet inescapably gendered. Every nonbinary person has to struggle with this to some extent. The struggle of which bathroom is safest to enter, which dress code applies to you, what designation is on your government documents, how do you engage with people of different genders, what gender do people assign to you just by looking at you... how will people react when they realize that not only have you stepped outside of the role you were assigned at birth, but that you have rejected gender roles entirely? What gender do you say you are when you're trying to get medical treatment or a job, or you get pulled over by a cop? What box do you, someone who cannot fit into any, jump into when it's a matter of safety? Either way there will be consequences for your gender transgression, but which consequences can you endure?\n\nThe alienation of not fitting into that binary can be a *nightmare.* Any of those situations I just listed can easily escalate into a life-changing or life-ending disaster. Even if it doesn't escalate to that extent, transphobia is pervasive and can haunt every aspect of your life in ways you might not even expect. It wears you down and makes it hard to trust anyone. When you are trans/nonbinary, *every single time* a new person realizes you're trans is a new window of opportunity for harm. (And once opened, those windows can never be closed.)\n\nA whole lot of windows just opened up for your child when you outed them at that party.\n\n*That's* why it is so important to let someone come out at their own pace. Especially a child. It isn't just a matter of etiquette. It's a matter of safety, and a matter of letting someone adjust to *a new reality of their life* in ways/at a pace they can mentally handle.\n\nWith all that being said, can you begin to see why a gender-separated party that emphasizes stereotypical gender roles was *never* a good idea to begin with?\n\nSo you do owe your child an apology. But also, you and your husband should start educating yourselves on what it means to be nonbinary and how you can better support and protect them.", "Soft YTA. While the intentions were good, it may have been wiser to ask up front who they wanted to invite.

Moreover, why did you not actually *discuss* this genius plan with the birthday kid and get their perspective on how this would likely go over and what they wanted to do/if they felt comfortable coming out to their friends in this manner?", "I\u2019m confused, where do you live that girls can only have birthday parties with other girls and boys only with other boys?", "I'm hoping but you would need the imagination of Stephen King to make up something this horrific.", "Sadly, it is very unlikely to be fake.", "I would be on a the gaming floor myself- I identify female.", "I know its overused, but I don't think this is real. There's absolutely no way an adult with two brain cells thinks this is a \"genius idea\", much less went to reddit to post about it. This post is the product of someone's imagination.", "Idk. I guess maybe at age 9 or 10 it would have been workable in your scenario. But by age 12?I know when I was 12, every single thing I did was to get the attention of the boy(s) on whom I had crushes (or at the very least to help my friends annoy/attract *their* crushes\u2026)\nI happened to be a cis girl who liked boys \u2014 and, though I don\u2019t know the current percentages, I\u2019m guessing that 75-85% of 12-year-old party goers would be cis/hetero kids (at least at this particular moment in their lives).\nSo, separating by genders might have been a bummer anyway.", "I agree, having stations for these activities might have been fine and not really outed their child either. It also would have been a great way to show support in that activities dont have genders. Girls can play video games and boys can wear makeup etc. \n\nIn addition, separating gender by these activities would have been a nightmare for me at age 12. I wasnt allowed to wear makeup and my mom disapproved of me being friends with girls who did or had other stereotypically feminine interests. I can't imagine it would have gone over well for all the children invited too.", "I'm referring to the use of \"son.\" It was only after the post was made and I wrote this comment that OP wrote that they're okay with \"son.\"\n\nEven without that, I think outing someone and this absolutely ridiculous \"binary\" themed party justify the judgment.", "I think you need to do some reading about what being non-binary actually means. You may have been trying to be supportive, but the party you planned goes beyond accidentally outing your child. It shows a serious misunderstanding of the meaning of non-binary. Generally speaking, non-binary people believe they do not fit into the traditional gender roles or the \u201cbinary\u201d meaning the two genders. It\u2019s not \u201cboy and girl\u201d it\u2019s neither boy nor girl. You threw a party that was literally gender binary themed. You reinforced the gender binary by providing activities traditional society views as gendered. And then you separated the party guests by TWO genders. The two genders that your child has confided in you that they aren\u2019t sure they fit into. Notice how you didn\u2019t think to make a \u201cnon-binary\u201d space? Which part of the party does someone who does not fit into the gender binary attend? They are not a boy or a girl. \n\nTo put it as simply as I can, not only did you out your child, you threw a birthday party that excluded them. What you did is so out of touch that I almost feel like this post can\u2019t be real. I hope it\u2019s not. This was likely very traumatizing for your child if it is. I feel deeply sad for them. \n\nYTA OP", "Doing nothing different is significantly better at trying than this garbage.", "NB and gender fluid arent the same thing. Fluid's a kind of NB. NB is just someones identity being apart from mainstream gender classification  or lack of a gender. Even if the kid was fluid the parents shouldve just had a non-gendered party, or a mix of boyish and girly things. Its just weird to do what OP did", "Gender fluid and Non Binary aren\u2019t the same thing. \n\nNon Binary includes people who identify as neither male, female, both or none of those\n\nGender Fluid:  type Non Binary identity where a person\u2019s gender identity may shift at different times, so they could feel male, female, both or none of the above. \n\nGender Fluid people are Non Binary, but not all Non Binary people are Gender Fluid.\n\nTerminology matters because it means you\u2019ve been heard, recognised and respected.\n\nIf OP\u2019s kid said they were gay would you belittle their own sense of self by assuming \u201cthe kid probably doesn\u2019t even know they are using the wrong term\u201d and are, for instance, probably bi? Probably not, because telling a gay person they\u2019re probably bi and using the term gay incorrectly is AH behaviour.\n\nETA: OP says\n>\u201d From what I understand they sometimes feel more like a boy and sometimes feel more like a girl.\u201d\nOP is describing her child as Gender Fluid (while demonstrating she doesn\u2019t know what it means), not the child. \n\nYou\u2019re defending a person by accusing the actual person (child) of not understanding terms while conflating terms yourself.", "And unfortunately, neither will any of the guests. And quite possibly neither will the internet if they posted photos of this 'genius idea' or if any of the other people there did.\n\nAnd I doubt that they'll let the kid live it down either.", "This is a terrible idea. Having a party related to gender/identity in the first place was weird, but I can *almost* follow your (misguided and frankly ignorant) logic. But after the fiasco that was the first attempt, why on earth would you do it again?\n\nYour kid probably already feels very alienated and othered by your actions. The answer is not just a better NB-related party. Why single out your NB child in that way? The answer is to throw them a party that aligns to their hobbies/interests, not their gender identity.\n\nUnless someone specifically mentions wanting to have their identity/differences celebrated, generally it\u2019s good to treat them like anyone else. In this case, that would mean picking a birthday theme like \u201cminecraft\u201d or \u201chorses\u201d or \u201cjewelry\u201d or whatever the hell it is your particular 12-year-old likes.\n\nAll of this is somewhat irrelevant, though, because I think any type of surprise or themed party should be off the table basically for the rest of your child\u2019s life. They\u2019re feeling really vulnerable right now and the best thing you can do (in addition to a sincere apology and educating yourself) is to give them some agency back. That means they get to choose if, when, and how to have another party. They pick the theme, the invitees, the parameters, everything. They might not want any sort of party for many years to come, and that\u2019s valid too.\n\nJust please, don\u2019t try to fix this by thinking *oh we\u2019ll ask the other NBs what they like!!*", "Thier child changes swaps between son and daughter depending on how they are feeling. Am I the only one who read the post? The party they threw makes it pretty clear.", "Ya, this whole story is so bizarre I'm really doubting it's a real one. \n\nI just can't make heads or tails of who these people are and what they were actually thinking. For the hypothetical child's sake, I sure hope this is fiction.", "its pretty clear that its new to you. i get that youre trying to be supportive, but you goofed here. \n\ntalk to your child. apologize. take them to their favorite restaurant. take them out to buy a new outfit. ask them about a party re-do. have your child be an active participant in the planning, and follow their lead. \n\n\nsoft yta. you can mend some of the damage you did here. listen to your child, and follow their lead.", "\"this whole NB thing\"\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYour child has informed you that you misgendered from birth.  Im willing to bet accepting \"son\" is because they are acutely aware of your cluelessness...", "Attitude is hard not to have when you are non-binary like the child mentioned in the post. They endangered their child and might\u2019ve completely alienated them from their friends. Even if unintentional, even if it comes from a good place, people can still tell you how they feel if what you did was harmful. It\u2019s not abuse. It\u2019s righteous anger. There\u2019s a difference.", "I\u2019m not angry at the 12 year old at all. I\u2019m angry at the parents for not communicating with the child or doing any research before outing them and endangering their life. I made this comment before I saw OP\u2019s post about the kid being okay with the terminology but I still won\u2019t say it myself.", "Also just enforcing gender stereotypes? What about the girls who want to play video games the the boys who want to do makeup? You are making it harder for people to be non binary because now they have to pick if they feel like a boy or a girl essentially. What if your non binary child felt somewhere in the middle that day? They are essentially forcing them to feel like a girl while with biological girls and feel like a boy with biological boys.", "Because the child is happy being referred to as their son and as him.\n\n\n\nIt sounds more like gender fluid than non binary.", "Per comments (I'm not feeling much like reading anything else OP posted, honestly) sounds like their child is fine with being called son, but I just want to point out to you that it's really, really frustrating how often people who should take five minutes to simply ask a nonbinary person important questions seem to feel no interest nor inclination towards doing so. Quick convos about particulars and feelings could have made it clear that this was not something their son wanted to be out there in that way, Also could have cleared up where their child is - there's a huge range here, and reinforcing binary clearly wasn't it.  \n\n\nI honestly think this is a bait post intended to show \"supportive\" parents and icky social justice warriors and the trans community ganging up on them for \"trying so hard\" as that's pretty common these days; parents whining about being so unfairly maligned for being \"supportive\" while not actually doing any legwork to BE supportive, and the first step of that legwork is quite simply an open dialogue and no steps taken that a nonbinary person isn't comfortable with in terms of outing them or discussing them publicly.", "Where was the dad with the choreographed dance routine when you need him?\n\n\nProbably still torturing his daughter in law I guess.", "Just sharing appreciation for \u201coof a doodle.\u201d I constantly say \u201cf*** a doodle\u201d and my brother thinks it\u2019s odd (but amusing).\n\nAnd I agree this is a terrible idea. Parents assumed the kid was out to their friends, and you know what they say when you assume. I\u2019m a cis woman and the girls party doesn\u2019t sound as fun as the boys. Is it fun to get dressed up sometimes? Yeah. But sitting around while the boys get to play games? Boo.0", "I uhh\u2026 skipped the middle and then had to go back and reread it to find out about the gender stereotypes. \n\nAlso NB\u2026 also kept thinking no. No. Please tell me you didn\u2019t. Omg. No.", "Years of retail/IT have made me believe stories like this  with out question.", "I disagree, this is coming from the same society that invented gender reveal parties which are becoming increasingly more deranged. This is totally believable, maybe you and I are enlightened about the finer points of transgender/nonbinary identity, but most of the world isn't.", "I would love to believe this is fake because no kid deserves this, but honestly, it\u2019s not too far fetched. You know how sometimes someone who likes to come off as smart will pretend to know what they\u2019re talking about but to anyone who really does understand the topic, it\u2019s clear they actually have no idea what\u2019s going on?\n\nYeah I\u2019ve experienced a lot of that when it comes to people reacting to lgbt+ stuff. Lots of people like to be seen as very supportive but never do any research on how or what it means to be supportive, and just go in blind hoping that they\u2019re doing it right. I\u2019m trans and I\u2019ve had people who thought they were being supportive tell me I\u2019m \u201cbeing trans *wrong*\u201d because I wasn\u2019t their idea of trans.

At least they are accepting them, they just need to learn to communicate.  I don\u2019t think some people get nearly enough credit for trying.  A lot of people on Reddit expect everyone else to be perfect knowing damn well they make mistakes too.", "Really? Because you're really hyper fixating on the fact that they are using the term non-binary instead of gender fluid.\n\n\nI don't know why it's so strange to people that a 12 year old might get those terms mixed up", "Ooh I don\u2019t know this one. Link?", "There are some people who are arguing for different judgments.", "I guess I should've said to ask!! OP, ask your child what they prefer", "I\u2019m not hyperfixating on that at all.

I feel like you\u2019re misunderstanding that my comment is about the parents and the way they went about this and what they could\u2019ve done better. Sure I didn\u2019t say it in the nicest way.
