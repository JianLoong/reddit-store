Yesterday was their 12th birthday and my husband and I wanted to do something special for them to also celebrate their new identity. My husband came up with the genius idea to have two birthday parties at the same time in our house, one for the boys and one for the girls, and our son could move freely between these two parties based on how they feel. At the end everyone would gather together to celebrate our son's birthday.\n\nWe invited all of their friends for a surprise party, but didn't tell them about the theme to keep it a secret. We made our first floor the \"boys floor\" and the second floor the \"girls floor\". For the boys floor we had some table games and game consoles, and for the girls floor we invited two makeup artists. Both floors had snacks, drinks and appropriate decorations and music. When the friends came, I had them all waiting in our garden. My husband was responsible for bringing our son. However, after my husband came with our son and we explained the theme of the party to everyone, my son started to cry and locked themselves in their room. Only after we talked to them we realized that they haven't came out to their friends yet and we basically outed them in front of everyone in \"the most humiliating way\" according to them. They also said that our idea was stupid. We tried to make them go out of their room but to no avail, and eventually we had to cancel the party and let everyone go.\n\nMy son still doesn't want to talk to us, and I think we might have screwed up big time.

You had a golden opportunity to put all of the birthday activities on the one floor and celebrate the fact that makeup, gaming, music, and foods + drink are all genderless/genderfull activities.

YTA", "YTA. Ouch. You meant well so there\u2019s that.", "Are they comfortable being called your son? That gendered language was the first red flag. (Not to invalidate their identity if they are okay with it, but it seems like these parents are clueless.)\n\nI'm not even going to get into chewing you out for outing them, which was literally the worst thing you could possibly do. Even if they were out to everyone, this party was a terrible idea. Gender-segregated events are notoriously difficult for nonbinary people because they literally don't belong in either of those spaces. because, you know. they are NOT part of the BINARY.\n\nYTA.

Sometimes (every time?) parents just don't \"understand.\" But throwing a party, that's out of the love for your child even if it's not quite right. I never had a party at all. I think it'd be cool to have multiple themes.", "You meant well but YTA-\n\nYour child is 12. You should have asked them before doing this. It's also not your right to out them.", "YTA. Not only did you out your *child*, you also did go big on gender stereotypes by enforcing cliches for the party. Videogames for boys and makeup for the girls? C\u2019mon. I\u2019m pretty sure most of the kids would have been more happy to not be separated for no reason and have a celebration with all of their friends regardless of their gender.", "YTA. Ouch. You absolutely screwed up. Your poor kid \ud83d\udc94", "YTA - The party wasn't for your kid. Clearly.\n\nYou basically used your kid as an excuse to throw a party that showcases how cool and tolerant and virtuous you are.\n\nYour title says you outed them, yet you still needed to post.\n\nYou thoughtlessly threw your kid under the schoolbus while pretending to be an ally. (Allies don't out people).\n\n\nBeyond all of that, did it occur to you that it's a pretty shitty host that ignores their guests half the time...  There was no version of reality in which this surprise party could be a good idea.", "YTA. I think you were well intentioned. But you blew it in terms of execution. In so many ways. \nFirst, non-binary doesn\u2019t mean multi-personality where one is male one moment and female the next. \nSecondly, non-binary people struggle with social settings or facilities that are based on gender- e.g. restrooms and locker rooms that are divided by gender. Because they don\u2019t identify as either- which one is going to be appropriate or more comfortable for them, etc. \nso consider the context of having a party where you divide people by gender. \n\nYour child may be struggling to understand themselves right now. So I get that it may be hard for you to understand everything. I encourage you to seek support from a therapist who is experienced and supportive of those with gender-related questions/concerns.", "YTA.

You outed a 12 year-old in front of all their friends without consulting them first. Don't ever do that. They are the only one who gets to decide when, how, or even if, it ever happens.

Okay.\n\nEDIT: YTA!!!!!!!", "So, you outed your child without permission, you segregated people by your perception of their gender, and you forced them into your stereotype of \"gender appropriate\" activities based on that perception.

I wouldn't call you guys assholes because considering you're just as new to this revelation as your child , it's understandable as to your adjustment. The party was in good faith & I saw a comment where you stated that you're new to this. You should've really spoke about it with them first because speaking from experience, not everyone comes out to their friends first before the family. I can see it wasn't your intention to purposely out them. Just give them a few days, and let them come to you when they're ready. This is a very big deal in their life right now & chances are they're feeling alone. Don't fully remove yourself , but rather do more research on what being Nonbinary is & take it from there...with that being said, NAH", "Oml yta", "Yta \n\nOmg so much", "Oof. Yeahhhhh, YTA.", "YTA a non-gendered party that doesn\u2019t mention gender or do anything to acknowledge the gender binary would be better and wouldn\u2019t have outed your child.

Holy shot do some research next time. Also \u201cmy son my son my son my son\u201d cut the shit. Do some research.", "YTA.  If you want to regain your child's trust, you need to seriously educate yourselves on what it means to be nonbinary, because the \"fun party\" you came up with is a **fundamental misunderstanding** of what it means to be nonbinary.  Each \"party\" you threw was a **complete reinforcement** of the gender binary and all the stereotypes that come with it.  If your child doesn't completely identify with either category of girl/boy, why would you host a party that *separates* everyone by gender?  This truly does not make sense and it is **not** genius in any way.  *Please* change your perspective that this party was even a good idea in the first place.  \n\nThis doesn't even touch on the fact that you outed your child to everyone.  Again, I think this boils down to your total unawareness of what it means to be nonbinary or queer.  You can apologize to your child now, but until you make a real effort to educate yourselves about the queer community and nonbinary folks, you're going to continue to make uninformed assumptions that hurt them.", "ESH your son should\u2019ve told you he hasn\u2019t told other people yet. You should\u2019ve asked your son if the theme was okay.", "If I were your child I would disown you.", "YTA.\n\n>Son\n\nIf your child is NB, why do you keep calling then your \"son\"? Also, have y\u2019all even considered asking if they came out to anyone else yet? You just jumped to the conclusion and outed them?\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t see the comment made, they are ok with being called son. Still, you\u2019re TA for outing them\n\nOk I got it, I made a mistake. I never met and heard of someone that young coming out.", "I get that you had good intentions, and I get how this seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't. Obviously enough judgement has been passed, so I'm not going to do that or call you names, but your child is right to be upset about you outing them without consulting them first. They will almost certainly lose friends over this when those friends' parents find out and forbid the friends from seeing your child; they're probably not ready for that. Also, at this age, plenty of those friends will have heard awful things at home and will repeat them to your child because most 11 and 12yos are still just parroting their parents on most things, even if they themselves don't care or know they don't agree with their parents.\n\nApart from that, the idea is pretty cringey. Genderfluidity (which sounds like what your child is experiencing) doesn't mean I'd be comfortable going between two sex-segregated rooms for the length of a party. For me, and many people, it means my gender feelings are different in different situations. For others, the change is on a scale of weeks or months, not minutes or hours. For other nonbinary people, it means they don't go between the two, but they are neither, totally outside the boxes, and thus a segregated party would feel very isolating and point-missing. It's possible that's what your child feels like. At the age of just-turned-12, it's very unlikely they're able to fully articulate how they feel and what they are, and it will probably be years before they can because the language for trans experiences just doesn't really exist, it's much more of a learning process to figure out how to talk about it.\n\nThis idea would have been much better, honestly, if it wasn't segregated. Have makeup artists and game consoles in the same room/same floor/whatever, and let EVERYONE move between activities that interest them -- I guarantee you there was at least one girl in that group who'd rather play video games, and one boy who wants to learn about makeup.\n\nI'm glad you're accepting. Your support and love is going to matter more than anything else in the coming years. But you're going to need to take your son's cues on what kind of support they need from you. Don't try so hard, you know? Just listen and keep loving them.", "YTA not only did you out your child to their friends, some thing they were not ready to do yet, but in planning a party for a non-binary child, you leaned in so heavy to gender stereotypes. You separated the boys and the girls, and gave the boys games and the girls make up. I don\u2019t even know what to say.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
