Why is she so under supervised that she's getting into fights to get arrested, and having pregnancy scares??\n\nAll that aside, with your parents not actively helping, have you tried to talk to your sister about all this? Just spend more time with her, ask her why she's doing these things in the first place. That she knows she is putting herself in danger, or she could end up going to juvenile detention? These things don't just start happening. She's either got poor influences in her life, or she's dealing with mental illness. It could be a range of mood disorders, or something worse, as these ages are the common time to start seeing symptoms.\n\nCan you spend more time with her? Honestly, your baby really could be the thing that changes her behavior a bit. Remind her with love always, that you want to see her happy and doing well, and you want your baby to know her and love her the way you do. She's probably very used to hearing everyone is disappointed, that she's a problem, that something is wrong with her, etc etc- when what she likely needs is loving and firm boundaries that are constantly reinforced. Obviously you aren't your parents, but the situation sounds heartbreaking.\n\nMy advise? Give her an ultimatum. I want you to be around my baby and I want to see you and I love you, but for that to happen, I need you to talk to someone. Don't call it the \"psych office\". A therapist. Plenty of people go to therapists. She can't be happy that she's always getting angry and in trouble- tell her the best part about a therapist is that they won't judge her, won't make her do anything, and that she can talk about how she feels when she gets angry and figure out ways to not let it get her in trouble.

At 18, we are finally rebuilding our relationship and she can be reasoned with. We went through therapy, a psychiatrist, medication, psychiatric hospital stays, the whole works. If she didn\u2019t have that steadfast support - with boundaries - then she would have imploded years ago.", "This I get but you being scared a troubled child is going to deliberately hurt a child, well, just hurts a sister relationship. She has never abused a baby before, has she?", "So what happened to her at 11?", "OP out of character behavior in children doesn\u2019t just pop up from nowhere. Did she end up in a bad crowd, is she being bullied, neurodivergence of some kind, is there something going on at home or school? It\u2019s not your responsibility to parent but if she trusts you maybe you could talk to her? See if you can find out what\u2019s going on and if that\u2019s the push your parents need to get her help? Good luck with your baby and the pregnancy btw!", "INFO: Has she been tested for neurodivergency? This level of acting out is highly unusual.\n\nETA: NTA. I agree with another commenter that she needs to be given a goal - go see a professional and find a treatment/program/medication/etc that works for her. \n\nI don't think its an out of pocket request to prove she's working towards positive behavior and consistently demonstrates it before she can be around a newborn. It would be rewarding the bad behavior she's engaged in without having her take reasonable accountability. \n\nIts normal for kids to test boundaries on a smaller scale. Since she's escalating in the wrong direction, something needs to change to protect not only her safety but those around her. Especially those those aren't able to defend themselves.", "Yes I saw that. \n\nOP has a good goal for sister that should be discussed with her... she will need to go see a professional, listen, participate & get some help if she would like to have a relationship with this baby.\n\neta \u2014 someone needs to set her up for success not failure.

It's weird you think it's fine for babies and little kids to be around that shit.\r  \n\r\n\nI never said that. \n\nShe's trying to use her unborn baby as a weapon against other family members - that's all I said.\n\nI also specifically said that if she was intending to leave that baby unattended with a teenager, she is a risk to the baby.\n\nDon't you find it embarrassing to literally *invent* what people say, then become upset at your own imagination? \n\nWhat a silly trait for any human being to have.", ">I mean a baby is dropped very easily. The sister just needs to decide to do that at one point, and all is done before mother can react.\n\nPutting aside that the idea that this girl would throw a baby is clearly out of the scope of this discussion, a baby can *definitely* be damaged when it used as a weapon of control against family members.\n\nA baby can survive being dropped with no injury - rarely can a baby survive being made a weapon against its family without injury. \n\nNobody is saying she has to let her sister hold the baby - but using it to try and force her sister to behave one way or another is absolutely foul.

I see it every once in awhile, and I just wish that we could get it back all the time.", "I got a random \"I love you\" a few weeks ago, and it brought me to tears.

She needs help, and the baby is not there to help the sister get back on track. Until the sister can act appropriately, she can't have a relationship with the niece because she throws things at her family right now and is a danger to the baby.", "She throws things and her parents and sister have to duck to avoid whatever object she\u2019s throwing. That alone is dangerous, because babies don\u2019t know how to duck. She could seriously injure or kill the baby with that act alone.", "They couldn't even get her into the pysch office without a major fight, so no they haven't tested for neurodivergency. And Mom's in denial, Dad talks but never goes through with anything.", "Seconded. Or a counsellor.

YTA for assuming she\u2019ll be a danger.", "Op not the parent. Most of those things need parent permission. Op can only push for it. She cant force her parents. However she can control who around her baby. \n\nShe didn\u2019t state that she will be cutting her sister off. She can still support her sister without having her around the baby.", "She doesn't have to leave the baby alone with the sister for the baby to be affected by her. Just witnessing violent screaming outbursts is scary for a babies and small children. It's so weird you think that someone like that should be around the baby. \n\n\nAnd speaking of inventing, you *invented* that OP's  intention is to control her sister rather than protect her baby. \n\n\"You can't be around my baby as long as you display dangerous behavior\" is a very normal boundary that many parents have.", ">Putting aside that the idea that this girl would throw a baby is clearly out of the scope of this discussion,\n\nThe sister is unlikely to actually throw the baby, but given the sister does throw things during her fits, it *is* quite possible that she ends up throwing something and it hits the baby. \n\n>a baby can definitely be damaged when it used as a weapon of control against family members.\n\nPreventing your baby from being in the presence of someone who has uncontrollable violent tendencies is not weaponizing the kid, it's protecting them from someone who you can't trust not to bring harm to hour baby.

If she realizes that her own sister is worried about her behavior enough that she thinks there is a non zero chance that her future niece could be hurt by her?  That might be the trigger for her to start crawling out of the hole she is digging for herself.", "This is a random question, OP, but is it possible that this change could be caused by other factors? Is it possible that she's neurodivergent?\n\nI'm not saying that it excuses her behaviors one bit, but I find it odd that she would flip a switch with no reason.

Your sister needs therapy - either to figure out what changed that shouldn't have or what changed should change that didn't or if it's a different factor altogether (some kind of medical cause).

Because kids need a clear answer + a way to redeem themselves, I would explain it to her as follows:\n\nThe shoplifting, vaping and seeing boys are not a problem concerning the baby. The violence against others is. How can I know you won't hurt the baby when you don't seem to have any issues with hurting and attacking others? Or that something you will throw won't my baby? I will stand by you if you want to have help with these issues. I love you but I don't condone this behavior and as a parent it's my duty to protect my child.

But no, OP is NTA, people who are displaying unpredictable, violent tendencies wouldn\u2019t be allowed around my children either.", "That isn't what she said. OP is entitled to only have safe people around her baby. Would you want someone who has been known to be violent around YOUR (hopefully hypothetical) baby?", "Do you mind if I copy this message?", "not in the US", "Op has stated that her and her family have learned to duck when sister throws things. So yes she's a danger to the baby if her family are having to duck when she is throwing things. This child needs serious help.", "You are right to be concerned. I\u2019m sorry your parents are so little help.

Also, it's a wise thing to make preparations and set boundaries in advance. Would you say setting up a nursery doesn't have to do with anything bc the baby isn't here yet? Or that OP can't let who she plans on allowing into the delivery room know bc she's not in labor yet? \n\n>Without knowing & understanding the motives behind what the hell is happening with this kid & why she is choosing to act out no one can possibly know what will help her.\n\nThat's a separate issue from OP making sure her child isn't possibly subjected to someone that could cause issues. Yes, the adults in the sister's life-especially her parents-should be trying to get to the root of the issue. It's quite possible that OP has been trying, but when she's pregnant there's a limit to what she can do. \n\nAs a soon to be mother of her own kid, OP's first priority is making sure the environment her baby grows up in is safe. If that means keeping the baby away from her sister until they can hopefully get her the help she needs, then so be it. OP says that her sister throws stuff, and that's not safe for a baby. \n\n>This kid is already acting out & now someone just handed her more stress about her future.\n\nLook, we all have sympathy for the 13 year old who is obviously going through somwthing she's not equipped to handle and that needs professional help her parents aren't getting her, but that doesn't mean OP should blindly risk her newborn's safety on the chance the sister throws one of her fits around them. It's not like this is an unavoidable situation-if OP didn't say anything and just didn't let the sister meet the baby without a word, she's gonna know what's going on. Better to be upfront with her about it than try to hide it.", "Of course not, good luck!", "\ud83d\udcaf"]}
