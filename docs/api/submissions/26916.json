Why is she so under supervised that she's getting into fights to get arrested, and having pregnancy scares??\n\nAll that aside, with your parents not actively helping, have you tried to talk to your sister about all this? Just spend more time with her, ask her why she's doing these things in the first place. That she knows she is putting herself in danger, or she could end up going to juvenile detention? These things don't just start happening. She's either got poor influences in her life, or she's dealing with mental illness. It could be a range of mood disorders, or something worse, as these ages are the common time to start seeing symptoms.\n\nCan you spend more time with her? Honestly, your baby really could be the thing that changes her behavior a bit. Remind her with love always, that you want to see her happy and doing well, and you want your baby to know her and love her the way you do. She's probably very used to hearing everyone is disappointed, that she's a problem, that something is wrong with her, etc etc- when what she likely needs is loving and firm boundaries that are constantly reinforced. Obviously you aren't your parents, but the situation sounds heartbreaking.\n\nMy advise? Give her an ultimatum. I want you to be around my baby and I want to see you and I love you, but for that to happen, I need you to talk to someone. Don't call it the \"psych office\". A therapist. Plenty of people go to therapists. She can't be happy that she's always getting angry and in trouble- tell her the best part about a therapist is that they won't judge her, won't make her do anything, and that she can talk about how she feels when she gets angry and figure out ways to not let it get her in trouble.

So telling a child you cannot be around my baby because you will hurt them is super mentally damaging, and actually cause to breed resentment against the baby that wasn't thete. OP is not talking to an adult- she's talking to a child. That is not her child. You siphon it through parents first.\n\nFurthermore, OP's comments are super concerning about sister. Generally, when you have a sudden personality change in a child, there is a catalyst. There is a very likely chance something happened to sister when she was 11. Very obviously, sister doesn't trust the adults around her. Given her extreme resistance to therapy, OP is describing a lot of red flags.\n\nEven if OP didn't trust parents, she did not need to frame it the way she did. Again, she is talking to a literal child. Talk to sister, say she doesn't want baby to see sisters temper, or is afraid baby may accidentally get caught up in a tantrum (something OP explicitly says in the comments). Ask sister to resume therapy and get a handle on it before coming around baby. Give the kid a realistic goal she can actually get to here. Sister actually seems like she likes the baby enough to respond to this. How OP approached and phrased this is vague and damaging. Sister seems to be being abandoned by parents, and OP seems to care. Take 2 seconds to think about what OP is actually saying and implying here\n\nAgain. It'd be a different story if this was another adult. But it's not. It's a 13 year old girl that OP talks like she cares about. That's worth a little care and effort. And someone needs to get this kid to someone she can trust and open up to, cause tge more details OP gives, the more flags it throws", "She sounds like she\u2019s in so much pain and has no idea how to even accept basic affection and care. That breaks my heart. This is a hurting little girl that isn\u2019t getting the care she needs. Something happened to her, whatever that was. Kids don\u2019t just act up like this out of nowhere and she doesn\u2019t seem to WANT to be this way. Maybe supervised visits if she promises to participate with psych or a clinical social worker would help, because she needs HELP and she\u2019s being neglected. Treating her like a monster you\u2019re terrified of is going to have the opposite affect you want, and your parents are being ridiculously negligent to a degree that a social worker WILL get involved in a less than desirable way very soon if someone who\u2019s an adult doesn\u2019t step up. It seems like people have already given up on this kid and it\u2019s just so incredibly depressing. Kids who feel loved and worthy of love don\u2019t react to affection this way, and kids don\u2019t suddenly start becoming that way at some random age. I hope SOMEONE helps her rather than just punishes her, because that doesn\u2019t help or motivate her at all.\n\nEdit: a word", "[removed]", "Good one; I hadn't heard that saying before--but it fits in so many situations!", "Yes\u2026 what risk do you think this means she poses the child?

She might need some help with her hormones, pre teen or if she has already started with her aunt flow, she needs y'all MORE NOW and not less. Don't give up and make it sound like she is unwanted.

And of course, the adults involved would all have to agree to it. What if you worked with a therapist to use the idea of \"being a good role model\" to help her use therapy. Written, that sounds a little worse than it did in my head, but my reasoning behind it is that it gives her a goal. But unlike things like \"to get better,\" \"to be the girl you used to be\" etc, which could feel like an expectation she could be terrified to fail to meet (I'm sure much more is going on), it focuses on someone else. You need a therapist involved because it's a non emotional 3rd party, and that way, you can make sure you're doing what is the best for all involved instead of allowing relationships blind you.\n\nIdk, maybe it's a bad idea. It did sound better in my head. I still decided to post it in case it helps in any way.. It sounds like she needs help, which is ok, and no one should ever be given up just because the help they need hasn't been figured out yet. \n\nCongratulations on your baby, I hope everything goes as smoothly as possible and everyone is healthy. I'm sorry for what you're dealing with with your sister.

But you could not pay me enough money to go back to being a teen. I vividly remember feeling out of control of my emotions, responses, and sometimes actions, and not being able to do anything about it.\n\nTell her that you miss the way your relationship was. That you love her, no matter what, and that you want her to be healthy. And that she needs to put effort in to those things. Ask if she's ok, whats going on in her life and why she's fighting and acting out.\n\nI'd also suggest that this could be a good time to model good behavior. If you seek therapy to help adjust to the changes in your life, then you could show her that its a normal and healthy thing to do.\n\nEven if you dont think you \"need\" therapy, there's a big difference between your whole family saying \"You need help. You need therapy.\" (Subtext: youre bad, and wrong, and broken) and your sister saying \"I'm worried about you. Therapy has been helping me talk about things I cant talk about with anyone else. It might help you too.\"\n\nPersonally, Id also rephrase your current boundary. \"I love you, and want you to be the amazing Aunt to my baby that I know you can be. But your choices and behavior lately arent those of a good role model.\"\n\nId also be allowing her to be around baby, just maybe not unsupervised. But its not my baby, lol.\n\nPhrasing your boundary as a goal for her is, IMO, way more likely to work. If you say \"I dont want you around my baby\" theres a solid chance that her teenage brain thinks you won't *ever* allow her to meet your child. That could do serious damage to her self image and self esteem. But saying \"Id love you to be around her, but your behavior needs to change\" is hopeful. \n\nId maybe set a solid goalpost too. Idk all kids, but I always did best with a measurable metric. Like getting a sprcific grade to earn something I really wanted. An *achievable* goal.", "She's what? 13?

They need to get out of their own heads and their own feelings and actively do something, because anything else has a far more tragic potential ending.", "Yet...she hasn't hurt you, or your parents, yet. One day one of you won't be so quick while ducking. Are you listening to yourself? NTA for setting a boundary, but you will be one if you don't expand it. Let your parents know the boundary extends to them as well because they cannot be trusted to put other people's welfare above their own conveniences.

She may have been abused or assaulted, and is acting out to try to regain control over her life.

Her parents can make excuses all they want, but excuses will not help her heal from whatever is going on.

Why do you think there's a problem with telling the sister now compared to when the baby has been born?", "I know AITA loves to throw the whole \"x must be neurodivergent!\" out at any symptom mentioned, but I wouldn't ask if it was one thing.

I\u2019m going to have to start paying closer attention to that type of phrasing. The thing that made my ears prick up was OP stating she felt like \u201cmy sister is still behind those glazed over eyes.\u201d If not outright drug use, I would assume a dissociative state secondary to several possible disorders based on that wording. I really feel for her situation either way, and I\u2019m sad it sounds like the sister isn\u2019t getting help she needs."]}
