He's my mom's brother. They each had kids when they met. My uncle had a 2 year old and a 4 year old at the time and my aunt had a 10 year old and an 8 year old. My aunt's ex husband is very active in the picture and is a lot of drama. He has turned their kids against my uncle, against my cousins and he inserts himself into their business a lot. He has his kids tell him stuff about where they'll be and he's shown up and caused trouble at family parties and stuff when his kids are there. The last incident was my sister's 12th birthday earlier this year and his kids wanted to go with him instead of staying. It was crazy and my sister was really upset that her party got interrupted and people were yelling.\n\nBecause of this none of the family likes to invite my aunt and uncle when my aunt has her kids. Everyone just finds it more enjoyable and less stressful. They have been intentionally not invited to stuff or family have planned stuff around when her kids won't be there.\n\nThey found out about a change in a party date and asked why, and pointed out my aunt's kids wouldn't be there. They said they would appreciate it being changed to leave an extra week so they could be. The family member said no. They were then going off and saying how could the family not try to make sure everyone is there.\n\nAll the adults were just avoiding it so I told them that nobody wanted to deal with their family drama and that's why they wouldn't change it to a date her kids could be there. I told them they shouldn't expect us to deal with the crap.\n\nI was told I was rude and that I was blaming them for stuff that is out of their control. That they involved the courts and have been doing their best to have the ex make less of an impact but they can't control a grown man.

They needed to hear it, and I would wager more people appreciated it (internally at least) than were actually upset.", "NTA. There's a reason the two of them are exes. The kids are the ultimate losers here though, because their parents can't act like adults.", "NTA for talking about the elephant in the room.\n\nStill, I think that your aunt's ex sounds like a huge AH and she and your uncle could use all the support from their family now.\n\nI think that your aunt should not tell her children anymore and go to court to stop this nonsense.", "NTA. I see in one comment you said these kids in question prefer their dad, or at least don\u2019t really like your uncle or your cousins. So maybe ask your aunt why would she want things on your side of the family arranged around when she has her kids, if the kids themselves aren\u2019t that interested? I see in another comment you say that your aunt does try to make things better, but sometimes parents have to do what their own kids wish for.   Maybe she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s trying to force her own kids to integrate against their will. Maybe she needs to let things relax a little bit, I doubt the kids enjoy the scenes when their dad shows up and causes issues either. I think possibly your aunt is failing here a little bit.", "NTA, and its definitely within their control to NOT force you and other famiy members to deal with their drama when in fact they also acknowledge there is a issue...", "NTA. ITs true that they cant control a grown man but why should everyone have to suffer through their bullshit? Obviously everyone was glad you broke the news or they would have said differently. And from your comments the kids dont even like yall that much or want to spend time with yall so IDK where the problem is except your uncle and aunt trying to force this blended family together.", "Info:  Is the aunt trying every legal way to keep her ex from showing up at these events?  Or is she just allowing it to happen?", "NTA.  You weren\u2019t rude.  They asked a question and all you did was reveal the elephant in the room.  I bet some of the adults were silently applauding you.", "Nta- truth hurts", "NTA.\n\nIt's no wonder people have messed up family dynamics when people refuse to say stuff like this out loud. The fact is that your aunt's ex causes problems and the easiest way to avoid any sort of situation occurring is for events to be scheduled when your aunt doesn't have her kids.\n\nNo one should tolerate uncomfortable or unpleasant situations just because it involves family. This isn't something for people to suck up for the sake of cohesion - the kids themselves don't even like your uncle's kids and go to lengths to be mean. It's selfish to expect people to endure these awful kids and a potential unannounced visit from the father just for the sake of trying to make kids who don't want to feel like family feel like family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "Ooh, this is a tough one.\n\nYour family is N T A for not wanting to deal with the drama. You're N T A for telling them straight up why the family is changing dates. They aren't really the AH either. So, I guess NAH but her ex.\n\nSomethings that might help:\n\n\\-Aunt attempts to take him to court over parental alienation (she'd need to document and your  family could back her up in court to show that he starts crap every time)\n\n\\-Have the courts set up strict visitation pick up/drop offs at a neutral location (police station parking lot; grocery store) during his visitation week(s) only.\n\n\\-Get a therapists for those kids ASAP to build a case that he's poisoning their kids against your uncle and family. If the therapist finds that this is the case, they will likely recommend that he can only have 3rd party supervised visits with him instead of a custody arrangement.\n\n\\-Restraining order to keep him from so many feet from any of your family's events. Might even work to keep him away from their home and them when they are out.\n\nHope that some of these may help them, but they really have to understand that her ex is not entitled to ruin family events. I hate this for your uncle and aunt and their kids, but nobody has to put up with this.", "I\u2019d agree that it was pretty rude for you to just blurt it out. In my opinion, but grown ass adults won\u2019t go and speak to another grown ass adult in a civil and serious matter about disparities, then they\u2019re almost at fault. But still NTA, my profession requires me to be very up front, direct, and confrontational when I need to be. If someone younger than me is in my lane and in the right, then I\u2019m most certainly in the wrong.", "NAH, really.  Aunt and uncle are just trying to raise their kids, it's the ex who is causing all the problems.  It's not a surprise that they feel upset that their problems are causing trouble with the rest of the family and they accurately feel excluded.  It's also not a surprise that everyone else *doesn't* want any of that smoke, hence do exclude aunt and uncle & co.  It is more sad than anything else.\n\nI do think you're approach and phrasing is sliding *real* close to the AH zone though.", "Your aunt is not managing her ex to the best of her ability. She does not need to give them information about events in advance so that the kids - who are caught in the middle of this 5h\\*t show - cannot tell their dad. NTA This is not your problem. I feel for the kids though.", "NTA....\"The truth shall set you free\"!", "Mildly Y T A if you were rude about it which it sounds like you were, but NTA for the openness and honesty when people are lying and acting behind their backs!", "Soft YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your place to say anything.\n\nIt is beyond their control, and is really shitty and stressful for them.", "If anyone was \"upset\" it may be to put on a front to say \"hey don't say that, we love them\". But they're just relieved that they didn't have to break that news", "I do think my aunt has tried to make things better for her kids. But her ex did not want her to move on and he didn't want his kids to have another family. And her kids kinda seem to prefer their dad or at least they don't really like my uncle or cousins.", "She has brought it to court and nothing was done. The whole legal thing is still ongoing though.", "She has brought it up in court and there's a legal battle.", "It undoubtedly is, but should other peoples events be ruined because of it?", "Do they already have a custody agreement in place that dictates when he gets the kids? If they don't, she needs to push for it. There need to be legal boundaries in place to prevent this kind of thing from continuing to happen.", "he shows up invited call the cops. harassing trespassing. get a restraining order. there are plenty of things they can do about the ex. the kids on the other hand could benefit from family therapy.", "Why don't they just not tell her kids any plans so they can't tell their dad? Like, plan it invite them but the parents don't tell the kids any of the details, then just take them when it's time?", "Unfortunately it is what it is, if he's showing up to bother her in private places during her custodial time she should call the police, I'm pretty sure that is harassment/stalking. The kids seem to be against your family though,  so they're part of the issue can't blame your family for thinking so.", "How exactly do the kids treat your uncle and cousins?", "They do have one. They share custody with equal time with both parents. She has brought him back to court over his stunts too but nothing has changed that anyone else has noticed.", "My uncle gets a lot of attitude from them and generally they don't like him saying anything to them. They can be really mean to my cousins and have made it so my cousins know they are not their siblings.", "Yeah, the kids take from their dad it seems.", "NTA\n\nGo you girl! Good job communicating better than the adults", "I mean you're blaming the dad of your barely stepaunt's kids but how sure are you she isn't part of the drama machine? NTA though", "NTA. Her kids are helping their dad to ruin her relationship with him and his family. You told them the truth and how they choose to deal with that is up to them. Your never wrong for telling the truth."]}
