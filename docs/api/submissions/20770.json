It\u2019s cool you have a spine honestly.", "INFO do they ever clean your items that you\u2019ve used?

Or do they expect you to do that as it\u2019s yours?", "NTA. Instead of each paying \u00a325 to split the cost four ways, they chose the price of cleaning it before and after they use it.

They explicitly said they did not want to split the cost with you. You're still choosing to make it available for them to use. That's nice of you IMO. A politeness. There are plenty of posts on this sub where roomies keep items like this in their own bedroom.\n\nI am curious about this setup though. When one or all of you move out, who gets the pots, who gets the pans, who gets the knives?

Good one!!\n\nOP, LOVE your reaction!! Spot on!! NTA!! \n\nIt's sooo convenient for them to gange up on you when they want to!!! Fuck them!!

If it's openly shared then everyone cleans it. \nI don't see why anyone would use it without cleaning it in the first place, that's just a basic part of using any appliance", "Yta, If you start playing this game you\u2019re entire  housing situation is going to unravel and you might lose friends.", "This is not something you should fight about.\n\nHow long does it take to clean an air-fryer?

Yes, but they didn't.  \n\nShould you clean the air-fryer after you use it, and not let it sit there, dirty?  Yes.\n\nKeep the peace.

It\u2019s not reasonable in this context for them to tell you to clean it for them.
