They didn\u2019t help you pay for a 100$ item and now have the gall to give you shit for not cleaning it? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being petty enough honestly lol. Me personally I would have told them to kiss my behind and lock it in my room", "You\u2019re being the perfect amount of petty for me. \n\n\ud83d\ude1d \n\nIf they had said they were worried about gnats or ants, I would feel different. But they straight up just told you they want to use it. It seems to me they should share the cost if that\u2019s what you all did for other similar scenarios.", "I'd leave it dirty too.  They didn't help pay for it and if they want to use it, they can clean it.  I would clean it and then hide it.  NTA.", "NTA.  Nothing at all wrong with petty.  The air fryer isn't shared, after all you paid for it.  They are lucky you let them use it all.", "NTA. It\u2019s cool you have a spine honestly.", "INFO do they ever clean your items that you\u2019ve used? If they clean stuff you\u2019ve used before you do, and they demonstrate some give and take then that is different?", "INFO: Do they clean it after they use it? Or do they expect you to do that as it\u2019s yours?", "NTA. Instead of each paying \u00a325 to split the cost four ways, they chose the price of cleaning it before and after they use it. You're generous to even let them use it at all, and I wish I were amazed that they were telling you to clean it so they could use it, but people are selfish.", "Well, it\u2019s YOURS, right?", "NTA. They explicitly said they did not want to split the cost with you. You're still choosing to make it available for them to use. That's nice of you IMO. A politeness. There are plenty of posts on this sub where roomies keep items like this in their own bedroom.\n\nI am curious about this setup though. When one or all of you move out, who gets the pots, who gets the pans, who gets the knives? How is this all decided, or was it all setup under the delusion that all three of you would grow old together, or is this a quad relationship?", "Generally in a shared house if an appliance is left on the counter it's used by everyone. Keep it in your own space if you don't want it used. NTA because the one you spoke to was entitled but reality of living in a share house here.", "NTA- obviously it\u2019s your air fryer, so you are free to do with it as you like. However, I don\u2019t think its a good idea to intentionally change your actions in order to get one over on people you live with. If you were upset about them using it, you should have said and asked for contribution.", "How they refused to pay for it, then turn around started using it, then tell YOU to clean up an item that THEY are cheekily using without no permission or request of yours but have not contributed NOTHING??? \nOhh that made me laugh!! Good one!!\n\nOP, LOVE your reaction!! Spot on!! NTA!! \n\nIt's sooo convenient for them to gange up on you when they want to!!! Fuck them!! They sound like a rotten sods!! \nI would totally tell them: if you have a problem how I'm keeping MY air fryer, then it's not yours to use!! End of discussion!!! If they at all in any way give you more back chat and do anything themselves to the air dryer you don't like, take it to your room!", "Yes you are petty. Don't ruin an otherwise good situation over an air fryer. Take the high road. YTA", "YTA - I mean technically you are entitled to do whatever you want with it but if you otherwise have a good living situation, this is a really dumb hill to die on.", "YTA and petty AF\n\nEither it's exclusively yours and only you get to use it or you make it a shared kitchen appliance and clean it afterwards like any other thing. You can still retain ownership either way.", "ESH. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are cooking food in it then leaving it dirty until you use it next? That's disgusting, even if it isn't shared. Tell the roommates they can each toss you 20 bucks to make it a shared kitchen appliance, or keep it in your room so it's not sitting crusty and gross on the counter.", "I mean you need to decide if it's yours or shared. If you want to say it's yours then you need to clean it. If it's openly shared then everyone cleans it. \nI don't see why anyone would use it without cleaning it in the first place, that's just a basic part of using any appliance", "Yta, If you start playing this game you\u2019re entire  housing situation is going to unravel and you might lose friends.", "This is not something you should fight about.\n\nHow long does it take to clean an air-fryer?  Two minutes?\n\nYou are living with three roommates.  Compromising is essential for everybody to get along.\n\nShould they have helped pay for the air-fryer?  Yes, but they didn't.  \n\nShould you clean the air-fryer after you use it, and not let it sit there, dirty?  Yes.\n\nKeep the peace.  Clean the air-fryer after you use it.\n\nYou might ask the roommates to chip in for it now, since they use it.  \n\nBut this really isn't something to fight about.  Friendship and a peaceful house is more important.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If we're making any sort of meat, anything heavily seasoned or sauced or melty, we clean it afterwards.

If they want to use it, they can each pitch you 25 and get over themselves.", "NTA. I think you are being petty, but your agreement with your room mates was to split the kitchen costs. Sounds like that included both the financial and labor costs. You mutually agreed you wouldn\u2019t be splitting the financial cost of the air fryer, so why should you also split the labor? It\u2019s not reasonable in this context for them to tell you to clean it for them. You would be fine to ban them from using it, since it\u2019s solely your property. \n\nI suppose the real question is, is this a hill worth dying on?
