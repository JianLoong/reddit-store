We have mutual friends due to having the same major at the same college. \n\nI, (25F) and my husband (28m) are expecting a little girl due in a few months. We are so excited and had been on the topic of names for awhile as we both wanted a name that meant something to us as we did with our other children (4m and 2m). My best friend Mary(fake name) (20f) passed away a couple years ago, and my husband brought up naming our daughter after her in some way. I LOVED the idea and we started brainstorming. After a lot of thought we had a few options, most were names I knew she had chosen for her own future daughter as we were unsure if Mary's parents would be okay with us using her name and we wouldn't want to without their blessing anyways. \n\nWe spoke to Mary's parents about our thoughts and Mary's mom, Jenny (also fake name) (43f) suggested a first name combining Mary's first and middle name to still represent her, but not have the exact same name. We loved the idea and the fact that Mary's parents gave us their blessing to honor her in this way. \n\nWe made the announcement last week for the name chosen and the story behind it. Everyone loved it, except for Hailey (fake name). \n\nHailey, (21f) was also good friends with Mary but in recent years they had a falling out because Hailey joined a FB group that was created trying to tell Mary to off herself (long and separate story). She messaged us blowing up saying that *Maryanne* was her name chosen to give her daughter and it was unfair of us to steal it like that without even talking to her. When we explained it was the name Jenny suggested and that's why we chose it, she screamed saying how unfair it was because now she can't use the name or people will think she copied us. Hailey is NOT pregnant, not had told anyone about her plans to use the name and was going to just use the name without even speaking to Mary's parents. \n\nNow a lot of the mutual friends Hailey and I have are coming at myself and my husband saying we should change the name we use because it's not fair that just because we \"got pregnant first\" means that we can steal a name that means so much to Hailey. \n\nSo Reddit/TikTok/podcast people, we want to know. Are we the AH for taking a name we didn't even know was \"dibsed\" to honor my late best friend with her family's blessing?", "created_utc": 1681247572, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ixvhf/aita_for_not_changing_the_name_chosen_for_my/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My guess is that either they were or they don\u2019t know about Hailey\u2019s involvement.
