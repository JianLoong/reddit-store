An extreme example: OP bakes only 3 cookies because their daughter works and could buy her own. \n\nThey may be on such a tight budget every potato makes a huge difference but if that were the case (ESPECIALLY) then charging the daughter $5 for chips may seem like charging $25 for a McDs cheeseburger.", "No where in the USA does a \"standard\" bag of Lay's Potato Chips cost $2.  $4.78 on [walmart.com](https://walmart.com) for 13 ounces.", "Nothing in OP's post suggest that.

That's far beyond a normal amount of food preparation within a functional household. Also note that there is no mention of the other 2 adults in the household contributing to any meals outside their prescribed limits.", "Also, the OP is extremely vague about these household rules surrounding food which he has imposed. The father only buys \"ingredients\", not \"food\". The kids are provided raw potatoes, no chips. Do they also get raw wheat and peanuts in the shell and fresh grapes in order to make their own peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Or flour and salt and the kids are expected to make crackers or pretzels from it? This is not about making an occasional meal or snack - it sounds like extremist controlling behavior to me."]}
