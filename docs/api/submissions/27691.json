You are supposed to be teaching them how to interact with those around them. Thanking people is part of that. Do you not appreciate being thanked at your job when you finish tasks for your boss?

This is good parenting.  Your child is telling you point blank how he wants that reinforcement; he wants to be thanked.  So thank him.\n\nIf you can't get the words out of your mouth, if you feel too angry and resentful about not getting thanks or appreciation yourself, find yourself a counselor and work through it.

Have a discussion about how it feels good to be thanked and how mom would like a thank you when she is helpful too. Show him it\u2019s a two way street.

Begin to intentionally create a culture of courtesy and gratitude in your home. There is no downside to this. \n\nI don't believe modeling thanking your kids will result in them thanking you for what kids typically don't have the awareness to recognize as their parents' hard work. I believe you need to directly teach your children they should be thanking you. And you have been handed the perfect setup to do this. \n\nOh, and my guess is that your husband is not thanking you for your contributions, either.

I need someone to tell me what I\u2019m doing correctly because I\u2019m all over the beating myself up for mistakes. \n\nTeach your kids some compassion and empathy.

Too many adults don't know how to grocery shop or do their own laundry or wash dishes or anything. But they're still just a kid. They need positive reinforcement.

He looked at it, shrugged and didn't say thank you. Nobody tells me thank you. If he thanked me for all I do he'd be thanking me constantly. Instead he just enjoys the house, eats the food, and plays videogames and sleeps all day. I'm not sure I need to hear 1000 thank yous. And I don't want to thank him for the rare time he does a chore. When he's given chores it aggravates him and he usually screws it up. Like if he goes to the grocery he will say he couldn't find things. If I asked him to drop off the dry cleaning he will say they didn't have anything for us, go have lunch somewhere, and come home. Even though I explained that it was to be dropped off, showed him the clothes, and explained in a text to dry clean it and not launder it. He told me a long time ago if he screws things up enough then I won't ask him to do anything. I think some people, like the OP just get overwhelmed and fed up. It would be nice to be thanked once in a while I guess. It'd be nice to live in a house where there is kindness and appreciation.

It's a weird hill for him to stake a flag on. Part of me thinks he's trying to annoy his parent  about something else. \n\nSimilarly, it's a weird hill for OP to die on too.

Like, it would be weird to me if I came out of my hotel room and my maid said \"I made your bed. Aren't you going to thank me?\" I automatically saw it the way most do: like with a waiter situation--it's a reasonable and polite thing to do. It feels like OP sees it more the way many people see tipping the restaurant on a carry-out order. But frankly, I think her reaction is kind of weird too. Saying thank you is so universal; demanding it is definitely weirder to me, but I'm struggling to think of a circumstance where it's weird to thank someone for doing a task, even if that task does serve the person too.  I mean, I thank my bus driver  even though he'd be going that route regardless of if I got on the bus or not. I thank my airline staff when I get off of a flight.

Her view is that SHE isn't owed any thanks, either.\n\nThe better answer is: yes, she's owed more consideration from her family.  They're taking her work for granted.  But at the same time, yes, saying \"thank you\" or \"good job\" is modeling polite and kind behavior.  Is it \"necessary\"?  Mostly, no. Will it get your further in life?  Absolutely, yes.  Cultivate the habit now of expressing some gratitude towards people who do things for you -- even if they did it because they had to, because they're being paid to, or whatever.  The more you put yourself in the mindset of expressing appreciation and positivity, the more that will reflect in your overall mood.  \n\nSo she's not an asshole for being pushed to a point where she got into arguments where heated things were said.

You SHOULD thank people for doing things (at least, doing them well), and that includes people who are doing a job that they're being paid for.\n\nShe's an asshole for letting things get to this point, if the actual problem is that she's bitter that nobody appreciates the work that she does and never thank HER, and that's why she really thinks they don't deserve thanks either.\n\nIt's great when the people in our lives realize what is bothering us, and figure out how to fix it. It's also great when people don't take us for granted, and realize they should give us a little appreciation for the stuff we do.
