So, I normally heat up pre-cooked frozen meat for them to add to whatever vegan meal I\u2019m serving. It\u2019s out of love that I cater to their dietary preferences. I would consider it extremely rude if I were to force them to eat vegan simply because I choose not to eat meat and I cook. When a division of labor is decided, it makes sense for the person that does the cooking to cater to the dietary needs of the people they are cooking for, because that\u2019s how they show their love for that person.

She shouldn't be expected to handle/cook meat if she doesn't want to. What he eats is up to him as long as he doesn't have that expectation. It's easy enough to make a mostly vegan meal that he can add his non vegan ingredients to at the end but she shouldn't be expected to be catering for him.

Walden Local is a meat company that partners with small farms who use ethical and environmentaly sustainable farming practices and once a month delivery to clients. They have dog food.", "I have a friend who makes food for her pups. My vet recommended against it only bc dog food is formulated to have exactly what dogs need. I unfortunately have one dog who's allergic to poultry and another on a special bladder diet, so may be more work than it's worth.", "If you believe that meat is murder and you have a moral objection to buying and consuming it, why would you want to buy and cook it for someone else? OP is NTA for not wanting to be vegan but he needs to start cooking his own meat then instead of expecting his wife to cook something she has deep rooted moral objections to everyday. I'm sure she would appreciate it if he occasionally ate a vegan meal with her too (if he doesn\u2019t already). Just because you're not veggie/vegan, doesn\u2019t mean every single meal you ever consume has to be meat based", "Yeah he didn't sign up for this", "And if the overall responsibilities of the household are shared also? If the wife chooses to stay home while the husband works?\n\nThe word \u201cserve\u201d is just the word that is used for it you melt. \u201cThe meal is served\u201d. You\u2019re virtue signalling", ">If you believe that meat is murder and you have a moral objection to buying and consuming it, why would you want to buy and cook it for someone else?\n\nThat's just inverting my question, I'm sincerely asking specifically what the connection between the two is here.\n\nIt's going to get bought and cooked regardless, what difference does the cook make?", "Even if he \"didn't sign up for this\". And even if she suddenly decided not to cook meat.  That's her choice, and she is well within her rights not to.  \n\nAnd if it's such a big deal for OP, he can make his own meat to go with the meals (it takes like 20 mins to cook the meat part, usually the quickest part), or if OP needs to have his wife cook him meat, then they should probably just get divorced and OP can find someone who eats meat.", "Actually, he did. He married a vegan. That\u2019s the definition of signing up to not having meat cooked for you.", "Shes been vegan for half her life, he most certainly did. Im sure he can cook up his own meals if one meal a day without animsl profucts would kill him", "The word serve is inappropriate. I'm not going to keep repeating this to you, good day.", "It literally isn\u2019t. Please don\u2019t repeat that nonsense to me. Good day", "Dinner gets served. It's like...the appropriate verb for the situation."]}
