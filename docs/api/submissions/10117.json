They broke up, he got depressed and was considering hurting himself, couldn't hold down a job because he'd stop showing up. Last year asked me if he could move in, my house has what used to be a porch that was converted into a full bedroom so it has a sliding glass door that leads outside.\\\\\n\nThe agreement was that he would work for a few months up there (he had just got a job) to build up a savings and move in. I wouldn't ask for any money while he was out of a job but once he started working he would help with bills. He has been here for over three months and swears he is looking for a job but i don't believe it. He didn't have any savings when he actually moved because his car broke down before he drove down. At first he was eating my food without asking and without telling me he was eating the last of something but now he goes to his sister's to eat and she occasionally sends him home with extra food so that's resolved. I still feel very icky about it, though and I think maybe this is coloring my perception of other things.\n\nEvery morning he gets up and gets on discord where he voice chats with his friends and he is so loud. I am autistic and I have ADHD, I get over stimulated and particularly when I'm tired or stressed. I have a very stressful job in public safety and we are short staffed so I'm working a lot and am always tired and stressed. He cannot shut his door to his room because I have a doggy door in my slider. My dogs love being outside, they've always gone outside freely and I didn't think it was fair to prevent them from this because he's struggling.\n\nI've had the past couple days off and I can't take this man laughing and hanging out with his friends. He is literally cackling and I'll ask him to quiet down and he'll drop his voice for a few seconds and then sponge bob giggle at full volume. I can feel the tension in my whole body. I am trying to relax. I put on my headphones and I can still hear it. I even closed the door to give myself some rest and I can still hear it. I go into my bedroom and I can still hear it.\n\nI finally had it and asked him to please refrain from voice chatting while I'm home if he can't control his volume. It's not even that often because I am working 50+ hours a week and am hardly home. He called me a controlling asshole and told me I can't control how he spends his time with his friends and I was a hypocrite because I voice chatted with my friends the night before but we were watching a movie together, I hardly talked and when I did I was quiet. He said if he could close his door this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nI am at my wits end. Am I the asshole for asking him to not voice chat?

If so, and \n you\u2019re fully committed to letting him stay, could you switch bedrooms so your dog can go in and out and he can have a room that closes and therefore covers up his noise more? These are just ideas because you\u2019re already helping him out a lot but if you\u2019re going to let him stay it may help if you can block out his noise more idk. Also how old are y\u2019all? \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward NTA because you\u2019re already helping him a ton and it seems like he\u2019s taking advantage if he\u2019s not truly searching for a job. You may need to lay down some ground rules like proof that he\u2019s applying for jobs.", "NTA. In the middle of the paragraph I thought you could be judging him for not having money/job and therefore having problem with enjoying his friends which would have been assholish. But this clearly is the case of him not respecting your boundaries at your home. \n\nI am also very sensitive to loud noises of people speaking and talking so I understand where you come from, but that said your family member could be being more defensive because he already feels insecure about his current economic status. So it would becoming difficult for him to empathise with your problem. Instead of laying down as a rule. Sit him down. Talk to him. And there explain him your boundaries.", "NTA - Firstl it's not \"his\" door, it's yours, it's your place that you're graciously allowing him to stay in; perhaps reiterate to him that this is a short-term arrangement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe's mooching off you. Plus he's walking all over you. The fact that as soon as he was there, with no money, he was eating your food withou asking (Which is commonly known as theft) and not even letting you know when he'd run something down. He's a conman, he's using you as a soft touch hoping you won't stand up to his bullshittery.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBoot him out and reclaim you space, sanity and stress levels. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhilst I'm not on the spectrum to any discernable degree excuessive noise does aggravate me. Where I live the kid next door, a boy about 12-ish I think, screams and squeels into his headset whilst he's gaming. Full tilt, actual girlish horror movie screams, I've been outside in my car with the engine running and music playing as I've returned home and still heard him over the noise. It's *insanely* aggravating to have excessive, sudden, random noise in a location you don'texpect it. Middle of a city? Noise. Fine. Middle of a gig? Noise. Fine (And the point of being there). At home on a quiet street where most folks are quiet and go there because it's quiet to then have some harpy child squeel like a little girl in pain because \"Fuck you Roblox!\" (Actual quote), not fine. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want your home to be quiet the absolute *least* he can do is shut up whilst you're in the home. When you're out working he can piss about all he wants with his Discord mates. But whilst you're there he tones it down to the point where you're not even sure he's on Discord. It's simple etiquette and common decency ESPECIALLY if he's not paying any bills.", "NTA but you need to set a date for this freeloader to leave your home.

He is freeloading. He can keep the noise down or leave.", "NTA - after reading the comments I can tell you're not comfortable kicking him out right now.

Then it's not you kicking him out, it's on him to get his shit together.", "NTA stop making excuses for him to keep living with you. He is leaching off of you.

You do it all for him.", "I am afraid that if I push him hard or tell him to leave he won't have a place to go. He'll feel depressed and could think about hurting himself again.", "His sister is a very manipulative and toxic person. I am only LC with her because of her children but I wish I could go NC. She might allow him to move in but she is emotionally and verbally abusive. I'm actually surprised she's started feeding him and I'm wondering what she's going to try to get from him in exchange for it.", "I am afraid that if I push him too hard he'll feel unhappy and want to hurt himself again. I am paying the same in rent as I was before he moved in and he's stopped eating a lot of my food so I feel that it's not too much of a financial burden. The only real differences now that he eats at his sister's is that the utilities have gone up but I make really good money so it's not that much of a strain. I want him to get a job but I don't necessarily need him to get a job if that makes sense.", "Our family is very very dysfunctional and emotionally abusive. I think that's why he moved away too quickly to live with a girlfriend he had never met in person. He and I are the closest in age and have always kind of 'endured' them together and that's why I think he feels that I was a safe person to turn to. I am LC with his sister and NC with his mom and most of our other cousins. The one aunt I still talk to has already said she will not take him in but she will loan him money if he needs it, which is why I was frustrated he spent all his savings on fixing his car. She would have fronted the money while he didn't have income. Although I don't feel like he will ever have income at this point.", "I think he may be neurodivergent because volume control can be one of the symptoms. I don't really struggle with that but I know others who do. I don't think he intentionally ratchets the noise up but if he can't seem to get a handle on it I just don't want to deal with it while I'm home.

It\u2019s not like this is a random person on the street or even a neighbor that owns and pays on their property.

Granted, I am not home for a lot of the day but I know of one interview he had and he was late and showed up in dirty jeans and flipflops so I feel resentful that he's not trying very hard. I actually pushed for him to start applying down here before he moved but he said he didn't think that was a good idea.\n\nI haven't wanted to push him very hard because I'm afraid he'll feel unhappy and want to hurt himself again but I am literally stressed on my decompression days.", "Or, he could be threatening those things as a way to garner sympathy and help so he doesn\u2019t have to work.

I can't speak to his mental health of course, but if you believe he is in danger of hurting himself I think connecting him with medical care is the best thing you can do for him and for you.", ">Although I don't feel like he will ever have income at this point.\n\nI think you are correct. And think about it this way, you can either kick him out now, or keep letting your resentment of him build up more and more until finally you can't take it anymore 5 years from now and kick him out then.\n\nI don't think there's some magical formula for you to get him to change his behavior and attitude. It's clear that he doesn't respect you, and views you as somebody to leech off of. So you're not going to be able to trigger any personality changes by continuing to let him walk over you.", "People make noise. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask him to be mindful of the volume, but to put a blanket rule of \"you can't talk to people while I'm home\" is generally unreasonable. \n\nAnd some of this issue can be mitigated if the cousin was able to close the door, but because of the dogs, which do have the right to exist in the house as they have prior to the cousin moving in, that is not possible. \n\nAs I said in my answer, the issue here really isn't about the call, it's about the fact that the cousin has worn out his welcome and OP needs to address that.", "Alright NTA for sure.

I understand that my immediate jump to \"he's going to feel unhappy and hurt himself\" is my anxiety, I have a lot of anxiety around death, partly because I'm around it a lot from my job. I also am very uneasy about just putting him out without a plan because I know how absolutely cruel 'the world' can be and I know that he's safe if he's here.", "Well, then it\u2019s up to you. Take his behavior as it comes. At this point, he\u2019s not going to get a job. You just need to decide how long it will be your responsibility to raise him into adulthood.

And to get him out of your house, too.  **Or a couple weeks at a weekly rental type of motel?** If you can afford to gift him a place to stay that isn't your house, he still gets some time to adjust and cope with things, and time to get serious about finding a job,  but while he's doing this, you get your house back and your needs met.  If you decide to do this, find out what you can do before you tell him.  If it's a weekly rental, you can make the arrangement, tell him there's a place for him to move to today, get some friends to help move him there, change the locks, and be done.

But it doesn\u2019t get easier until you work through the hard stuff.", "Kick his ass out.  If he asks why, just say, \"because I am a controlling ahole\".  OP you are nta.", "NTA (yet)\n\nYou need to get him out.  This isn't about just loud talk, it's about you really not wanting a roomie and everything that comes with it.\n\nYou will become the A-hole if you don't deal with it directly and the relationship devolves into fighting.  Dictating someone's behavior is not appropriate unless that behavior is truly \"bad\" by most societal standards.  Talking on Discord doesn't pass muster.  Just tell him it's time to go and he has 1 month, he'll think you're the A-hole, but you've done your time.", "op=NTA\n\nTime to give him official 30 day notice--he can go stay with his sister if he can't find something else.  Stop setting yourself on fire for him.", "Y-T-A to yourself.  You need to realize he is using you and give him a deadline, job or no job, he is out by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.  He has no intention of working while he can freeload off of you and others.  The other thing to make a list of rules that will make him uncomfortable that are in  effect until his move out date: 1)  no voice chatting from \\_\\_ to \\_\\_.  Give him chores.  The idea is to make him uncomfortable so he wants to leave.  If any family gives you flack, tell them you are so happy to hear they will be taking him in.", "Kick. Him. OUT!", "Send him over to his sisters.", "For what it's worth, it's genuinely hard to control your volume when you're on a voice call, and the only thing that I've found helps is to turn my computer volume as low as possible, since you tend to match the volume of the people you're talking with. I bring this up just because it's something that could make an actual difference that he might not have considered.\n\nThat being said, NTA.", "It's not for you to worry about where he goes.  That's on him.  If you're not willing to kick him out you need to set rules & let him know if he doesn't abide by them, he has to leave.  The first rule being he needs to pay you.  Give him a time limit to get a job.  I'm sure he can get a job, he's just being picky.  So take a crap job & work there while you're looking for a new job that would be a better fit.", "you aren't responsible for his well being when he is not making an effort to improve his personal well being. you aren't his parent, and you're doing a lot by letting him into your home without any form of payment after barely talking for a few years. you don't owe him this, but he does owe you holding up his end of the bargain if he wants to continue living there. he is an adult, not a child. you are not responsible for him.", "Maybe when he goes to eat at his sister's, he could just stay there. He does have a place he can go; he can live in her garage if she doesn't have room in the house.", "This falls under the category of NOT YOUR PROBLEM!", "Forever?  \n\nHe can go to his sisters.  \n\nPause for a moment and take whatever excuse you might think of making for him and simply don't.  It will be their problem to navigate.", "I mean .... you may feel this sounds harsh, but that's honestly not your problem or your responsibility. \n\nAs is often said around here, don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. NTA, it's time for this arrangement to end.", "He doesn\u2019t respect you.  That\u2019s it.  He needs to stop talking with them while you\u2019re there, or show some basic restraint.  The dude just doesn\u2019t care about you.  If someone gave me free housing and helped me out, I would treat them like a god.  I would not show such blatant disrespect.", "That's a genuine concern, but that means he needs to seek some sort of treatment for his depression. Ideally it's a combination of therapy and meds, but just meds can be helpful depending on the nature of things. \n\nDepression can be an acute or chronic illness. Most depression can be managed, but simply avoiding stresses and hoping it goes away isn't the best strategy.", "You could give him a date in the future when he needs to move on. Maybe a month or so away. That gives him a specific amount of time to figure things out (although it doesn't seem like he wants to do that). You've been more than generous with helping him out at this point.", "Let him ask his sister if he can stay at her place.", "NTA, OP, but grow a spine finally. \n\nThis man won't get a job anytime soon, if ever. He's having it all, why bother? He's fed, has a roof over his head, everything paid by someone else. And he isn't even thankful and considerate to those who help him. He is not showing in any way that he's sorry for the inconvenience with the noise. And he can stay in this state forever. You've done enough to support him and now it's up to him to decide if he'll do something good for himself. You're not responsible for his well-being and mental health. Do you really plan to devote your life to his needs and whims?", "NTA. What you should do is get him out of your home, ASAP. He is abusing your kindness, being disrespectful and annoying. Don't put up with something like that!", "NTA. Time to kick out the freeloader. Maybe his sister can house him.", "NTA. Might be time to invite him to find somewhere else to live since he doesn't seem to be doing anything about getting a job. You've been pretty generous so far and he's taking advantage of you. Being depressed isn't an excuse for being a mooch.", "His mental health is not your responsibility. His behavior is affecting YOUR mental health, and he is not keeping his part of the bargain. \n\nYour needs are AS IMPORTANT as his, and he is taking advantage of you. NTA, and you need to kick him out.", "Mental health and depression is very real. And you CANNOT sacrifice your own for someone else's.", "Unless you confront him with an utimatum, he will use his previous depression as a club to keep you from evicting him. He is already becoming a bully. You can't sacrifice your mental health for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA"]}
