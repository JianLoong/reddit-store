Like who actually gets stuck in an elevator? You didn't know it would last two hours though. That is terrible on any day, but especially a wedding day. Add in the claustrophobia and your friend is justified in being upset after the fact, even though in the exact moment it probably wasn't a big deal that you laughed. There's no reason not to apologize here. The not speaking to your friend part is what makes this a soft YTA to me. Just apologize to her.", "Need more info.

You know, \"remember our wedding day when the elevator stalled just as we were going up to the reception, what are the chances? That was so funny!\" Missing two hours of your own wedding stuck in a box is terrible, but you weren't laughing at that point, I think you really need to make that clear to your friend.
