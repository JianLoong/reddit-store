Not necessarily for laughing unless you knew she was claustrophobic. But laughing is sometimes a response to being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond, not just because you found something funny. Based on your post that could have been the case for you, though I can't know for sure. Ngl, if somebody told me my friend was stuck in an elevator, I'd probably laugh, especially depending on the friend. It's an over the top ridiculous situation, you know? Like who actually gets stuck in an elevator? You didn't know it would last two hours though. That is terrible on any day, but especially a wedding day. Add in the claustrophobia and your friend is justified in being upset after the fact, even though in the exact moment it probably wasn't a big deal that you laughed. There's no reason not to apologize here. The not speaking to your friend part is what makes this a soft YTA to me. Just apologize to her.", "Need more info.

The apology can wait until the bride is back from the honeymoon or whatever, but I would say OP is the one who should reach out, not the bride, at least right now. After a long enough time it becomes a stupid thing for the bride to hold a grudge over, but this soon it's on OP to reach out first.", "NTA. It's unexpected and bizarre and thus comical.

I know some people laugh when they are uncomfortable but it seems like you thought it was funny.\n\nI\u2019m not sure it was funny while they were still trapped.  I imagine it was pretty stressful time  for the couple, their parents, wedding party. This is the kind of thing you laugh about later when you know people are safe and okay not while it is happening.

I just personally don\u2019t feel it makes you an asshole. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of inappropriate laughter that was nervous laughter and it just made me giggle in return.

Not that hard. \n\nAlso, trying to say that you got over your claustrophobia so the bride should be able to too is fairly problematic. If you could just \u201cget over\u201d your claustrophobia because it \u201cisn\u2019t really that scary\u201d then you didn\u2019t really have claustrophobia. You had anxiety and nerves about tight spaces. Not the same thing as a full blown phobia.", "I agree, OP is NTA.

If you didn't know she was claustrophobic it wasn't insensitive.\n\nI laughed when my friend broke her arm as she walked down the hospital steps after being treated for a broken leg. So did most people. Not in her face. But it was just so bizarre and unexpected.\n\nLaughter is a natural reaction to unexpected events.

Whoever squealed on you might be the AH though. So unnecessary. Good luck.", "NTA who even told her you laughed and why do they need to stir shit?", "NTA for laughing, because they hadn't been stuck for two hours at that point and there was no indication they would be. I would have laughed too, because I would have assumed it was like a 5 minute hiccup, one that would become a funny story from the wedding day. You know, \"remember our wedding day when the elevator stalled just as we were going up to the reception, what are the chances? That was so funny!\" Missing two hours of your own wedding stuck in a box is terrible, but you weren't laughing at that point, I think you really need to make that clear to your friend.
