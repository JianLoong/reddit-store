There was silence, and I started laughing. I didn\u2019t know what to say, but I thought it was funny they were trapped in the elevator.  2 hours later and they finally got out! The next day my friend texted me. She heard I was laughing at her and her husband on the elevator, and she thought it was rude. She told me she was panicking because she\u2019s claustrophobic.

Would you think it was funny if it were you?", "YTA You\u2019ve clearly never learned how to read the room. You should try it sometime", "Is it related to the recent which is going on the internet where bride and groom got trapped in the elevator and hence missed their own reception but still stayed positive and took a group photo with the fire brigade who rescue them", "YTA\nMaybe I\u2019m a few years this will be funny, but in the moment the bride and groom were trapped in an upsetting situation and missing their own reception. It\u2019s not funny", "You can't help when you life, you still should realize that it upset your friend and should apologize for it. YTA for not realizing that, not for the act of laughing.", "YTA\n\nI get that you only thought it was a funny wedding fail like those on yt, but this is a person that is actually close to you. On her big day, she was forced to spend 2 hours in a closed area that scared her and fed her fears.\n\nAnd you thought it's no big deal, just laugh it out. If you would have been the one trapped in an elevator, no matter the day, would you enjoy being laughed at?", "Soft YTA. I'd probably do the same thing (assuming it was either a setup for a joke or a non-serious situation). But given they were legitimately stuck and it was distressing them, you really owe an apology.", "NTA - I laugh in inappropriate situations because apparently it\u2019s how my nerves come out. Also, I\u2019ve been stuck in an elevator 3 times and I laughed each time. The first because I was nervous, the second because it was legitimately funny (same elevator, repairmen had left a few hours before and it appeared to be operating properly). The third time because is this even real life? Also, I\u2019m claustrophobic. I no longer fear being trapped because it\u2019s really not scary.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was not nice to laugh ... but not a big thing. It WAS funny, and nobody was hurt.", "Dude that's not funny. Being trapped in a place isn't funny. I laugh as a coping mechanism and I wouldn't laugh in that situation", "YTA How would like someone to laugh at you during an emergency situation? You should have been told to leave. You owe the bride and groom an apology.", "INFO: What about that situation is funny?", "I would say this is a soft YTA. Not necessarily for laughing unless you knew she was claustrophobic. But laughing is sometimes a response to being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond, not just because you found something funny. Based on your post that could have been the case for you, though I can't know for sure. Ngl, if somebody told me my friend was stuck in an elevator, I'd probably laugh, especially depending on the friend. It's an over the top ridiculous situation, you know? Like who actually gets stuck in an elevator? You didn't know it would last two hours though. That is terrible on any day, but especially a wedding day. Add in the claustrophobia and your friend is justified in being upset after the fact, even though in the exact moment it probably wasn't a big deal that you laughed. There's no reason not to apologize here. The not speaking to your friend part is what makes this a soft YTA to me. Just apologize to her.", "Need more info.  Was OP aware the friend was claustrophobic?\n\nIf yes, then yes, YTA.  \n\nIf no, then NTA.  It's a perfectly normal reaction to laugh if someone gets stuck in an elevator/traffic for an important event.   The scenario is a comedy trope of sorts.  \n\nIrregardless It's not like op could have done anything, so I'm sure the friend will get over it eventually.", "Nta. You can\u2019t help it if something is funny, it was a reaction!", "NTA. Your friend seems way too sensitive - it's normal to react to something weird/uncomfortable with a laugh. Finding the funny in a situation doesn't make you an asshole, and how are you supposed to know she was freaking out? If you were hysterically laughing and making a scene, maybe YTA. But sounds like she takes herself too seriously. BUT YTA if you don't apologize for upsetting her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Being trapped while stuck in a wedding dress would be the fucking worst.", "Dude, it\u2019s been no more than 48 hours since they\u2019ve talked. And \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her since then\u201d goes both ways.", "That's fair, I did miss the date that this happened. But she still could have apologized in the last conversation that they had. And frankly she has more of a reason to reach out than the bride since she has the apology to make. The apology can wait until the bride is back from the honeymoon or whatever, but I would say OP is the one who should reach out, not the bride, at least right now. After a long enough time it becomes a stupid thing for the bride to hold a grudge over, but this soon it's on OP to reach out first.", "NTA. It's unexpected and bizarre and thus comical. I also would have laughed. Out of all the days, what are the chances? Unless she had a long train or the dress otherwise contributed to the malfunction. \n\nPeople take themselves way too seriously. It's a wedding, not a funeral.", "If I ever get stuck in an elevator, I hope I'm alone because I'm probably going to need to potty at some point \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso YTA. I hope you get stuck in one", "What part of getting trapped in an elevator is funny? Would it have also been funny if they had been in a car crash on the way there? YTA and honestly a pretty sick person to think getting trapped in an elevator is funny in any circumstance, let alone on a persons wedding day.", "NTA\n\nIt is funny upon hearing it so at the moment, yeah, I understand having a laugh.\n\nShe didn't know at that moment it would take 2 HOURS to get them out, and neither did she know the bride was claustrophobic (in which case I would have taken the stairs...)", "Even if she wasn\u2019t claustrophobic, why would that be funny? YTA.", "NTA. Getting trapped in a situation during an important time is a comedy trope.\n\nIt sucks she has claustrophobia, but the kinds of personalities I like are people that would be able to look back at this pretty soon afterwards and laugh that that happened. I would say someone is uptight if they're unable to see the silliness of it and just shrug.", "NAH The irony of being trapped on your wedding day is a little funny. Is laughing insensitive to her claustrophobia, sure. This all feels a little blown out of proportion.", "YTA you could have at least apologized when you learned how awful of an experience it was for her.", "YTA for laughing loud enough that everyone noticed and not apologizing. I know some people laugh when they are uncomfortable but it seems like you thought it was funny.\n\nI\u2019m not sure it was funny while they were still trapped.  I imagine it was pretty stressful time  for the couple, their parents, wedding party. This is the kind of thing you laugh about later when you know people are safe and okay not while it is happening. I\u2019m sure it would not be fun in the slightest to be stuck in an elevator for 2 hours on your wedding day even if you were not claustrophobic. Unless they orginally met due to a stuck elevator it is hard to see why this is funny.", "While \"newlyweds late for reception because they're stuck in hotel elevator\" does sound like the set up for a dirty joke (so I can see why you might have laughed), it sounds like your friend was really distressed and a simple \"I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking of how stressful it must have been for you. I spologize for laughing\" would probably go a long ways.", "Yta but I also would have laughed because my humor is horrible . But yea kinda Have to not laugh in public settings", "YTA. You screwed up. Leave her a sincere apology. Hopefully, time will heal this.", "YTA\n\nPeople who find someone else's specially a friend's misfortune funny is an AH", "YTA. You only thought it was funny because it wasn\u2019t you. Getting trapped in an elevator on your wedding day while in a wedding dress honestly sounds awful.", "INFO ?  Was it her dress that caught in the machinery?  If so, then NTA, because her inattention caused her situation.  Anyone with a friend knows if you cause a silly problem, then you get hazed.  \n\nIf it was a totally random elevator thing, then soft YTA.", "NTA\n\nAn elevator getting stuck is such an off-the-wall situation I think it's normal to chuckle hearing that. If I ever get stuck in an elevator, I hope my friends have a good laugh about it. You didn't know she was claustrophobic so you weren't intentionally laughing at her fear. She hadn't been stuck for 2hrs when you laughed so it's not like you were laughing at something you knew was tragic. An apology won't hurt but you are, in no way, the AH for laughing when you first heard about it.", "LOL no you're not.", "I would have laughed too! Hell, I'd have laughed as the bride. Or I would afterward anyway, I have cleithrophobia- fear of being trapped regardless of the size of the space; so in the moment I'd have been freaking out.\n\nYou're N-T-A for laughing. However, you will be TA if you don't apologize after knowing that it hurt your friend's feelings.\n\nNAH", ">Getting trapped on your wedding day sounds like a complete nightmare. Would you think it was funny if it were you?\n\nI mean honestly, yes I wouldn't just find it funny I'd find it outright hilarious. Humour is subjective, it's absurd to try and quantify it - You are no more capable of understanding why I would find it hilarious as I am at understanding why you wouldn't.\n\nTA here is whoever told the bride that they laughed, that's just unproductive shit stirring.", "My life is full of Murphy's Law examples. I would probably alternate between laughing hysterically and sobbing uncontrollably if it was me. But, then again, I probably wouldn't define myself as particularly stable, right now lol so take that as you will.", "I feel like Alanis Morrissett\u2019s Ironic should be playing for this. \n\nYes, YTA. Getting trapped in an e elevator at your wedding, even if you aren\u2019t claustrophobic would be awful. Apologize to your friend.", "Yes.", "Yes.", "Also, during those 3 times was it during a huge life celebration that you planned long-term with family and friends waiting for you, that you are missing out a huge chunk of time from?\n\nThat might have flavored the situation a bit more desperately", "good for you, it doesn't make it appropriate", "And even if you had, you would have apologized I'm assuming. OP isn't saying if they at least apologized when the friend told them they were uncomfortable.", "Once friend said they were hurt tho, OP should have apologized.", "That doesn't excuse OP from apologizing when friend said they were hurt by what OP did. Plus it doesn't seem like anyone else was laughing in that moment.", "Yes OP kindly explain the joke.", "You can however help it if you choose not to apologize when you find out it hurt your friends feelings. That\u2019s what makes them an asshole.", "I absolutely understand your point. I\u2019m just saying sometimes laughter bubbles up as a response of nerves. I never said it was appropriate. I just personally don\u2019t feel it makes you an asshole. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of inappropriate laughter that was nervous laughter and it just made me giggle in return. It\u2019s not the same thing as sitting there making jokes about how hilarious her dire situation was, and she didn\u2019t know at the time that her friend was claustrophobic.", "Also doesn't excuse OP from apologizing when the friend said they were hurt by it.", "It\u2019s the not apologizing that makes them an asshole. If it was just a reaction that they couldn\u2019t control, and they recognize that while they couldn\u2019t control it they understand it was inappropriate, then there should be no issue with them apologizing. Not that hard. \n\nAlso, trying to say that you got over your claustrophobia so the bride should be able to too is fairly problematic. If you could just \u201cget over\u201d your claustrophobia because it \u201cisn\u2019t really that scary\u201d then you didn\u2019t really have claustrophobia. You had anxiety and nerves about tight spaces. Not the same thing as a full blown phobia.", "I agree, OP is NTA. I was reprimanding you on your downplaying OP's friends claustrophobia and her situation.\n\n ' I'm also claustrophobic, and I've been trapped three times (you made being trapped into a competition?) And it's no big deal, it even cured me of my claustrophobia'"]}
