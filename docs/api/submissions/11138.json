She got married in a church, and her wedding was great.  Right after her wedding was a party at a hotel close to the church. 20 minutes after my husband and I arrived to the hotel for the party, the bride\u2019s dad needed to tell everyone there that the bride and groom are at the hotel, but they are trapped in an elevator. There was silence, and I started laughing. I didn\u2019t know what to say, but I thought it was funny they were trapped in the elevator.  2 hours later and they finally got out! The next day my friend texted me. She heard I was laughing at her and her husband on the elevator, and she thought it was rude. She told me she was panicking because she\u2019s claustrophobic. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since then. Now I\u2019m wondering if I shouldn\u2019t have laughed.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t know she was claustrophobic. I have tried to contact her but got no response.

Tell her you laughed because you assumed they were only going to be trapped for a few minutes, and now realize it was a long, nightmare.", "YTA. \n\nGetting trapped on your wedding day sounds like a complete nightmare. Would you think it was funny if it were you?", "YTA You\u2019ve clearly never learned how to read the room. You should try it sometime", "Is it related to the recent which is going on the internet where bride and groom got trapped in the elevator and hence missed their own reception but still stayed positive and took a group photo with the fire brigade who rescue them", "YTA\nMaybe I\u2019m a few years this will be funny, but in the moment the bride and groom were trapped in an upsetting situation and missing their own reception. It\u2019s not funny", "You can't help when you life, you still should realize that it upset your friend and should apologize for it. YTA for not realizing that, not for the act of laughing.", "YTA\n\nI get that you only thought it was a funny wedding fail like those on yt, but this is a person that is actually close to you. On her big day, she was forced to spend 2 hours in a closed area that scared her and fed her fears.\n\nAnd you thought it's no big deal, just laugh it out. If you would have been the one trapped in an elevator, no matter the day, would you enjoy being laughed at?", "Soft YTA. I'd probably do the same thing (assuming it was either a setup for a joke or a non-serious situation). But given they were legitimately stuck and it was distressing them, you really owe an apology.", "NTA - I laugh in inappropriate situations because apparently it\u2019s how my nerves come out. Also, I\u2019ve been stuck in an elevator 3 times and I laughed each time. The first because I was nervous, the second because it was legitimately funny (same elevator, repairmen had left a few hours before and it appeared to be operating properly). The third time because is this even real life? Also, I\u2019m claustrophobic. I no longer fear being trapped because it\u2019s really not scary.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was not nice to laugh ... but not a big thing. It WAS funny, and nobody was hurt.", "Dude that's not funny. Being trapped in a place isn't funny. I laugh as a coping mechanism and I wouldn't laugh in that situation", "YTA How would like someone to laugh at you during an emergency situation? You should have been told to leave. You owe the bride and groom an apology.", "INFO: What about that situation is funny?", "I would say this is a soft YTA. Not necessarily for laughing unless you knew she was claustrophobic. But laughing is sometimes a response to being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond, not just because you found something funny. Based on your post that could have been the case for you, though I can't know for sure. Ngl, if somebody told me my friend was stuck in an elevator, I'd probably laugh, especially depending on the friend. It's an over the top ridiculous situation, you know? Like who actually gets stuck in an elevator? You didn't know it would last two hours though. That is terrible on any day, but especially a wedding day. Add in the claustrophobia and your friend is justified in being upset after the fact, even though in the exact moment it probably wasn't a big deal that you laughed. There's no reason not to apologize here. The not speaking to your friend part is what makes this a soft YTA to me. Just apologize to her.", "Need more info.  Was OP aware the friend was claustrophobic?\n\nIf yes, then yes, YTA.  \n\nIf no, then NTA.  It's a perfectly normal reaction to laugh if someone gets stuck in an elevator/traffic for an important event.   The scenario is a comedy trope of sorts.  \n\nIrregardless It's not like op could have done anything, so I'm sure the friend will get over it eventually.", "Nta. You can\u2019t help it if something is funny, it was a reaction!", "NTA. Your friend seems way too sensitive - it's normal to react to something weird/uncomfortable with a laugh. Finding the funny in a situation doesn't make you an asshole, and how are you supposed to know she was freaking out? If you were hysterically laughing and making a scene, maybe YTA. But sounds like she takes herself too seriously. BUT YTA if you don't apologize for upsetting her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Being trapped while stuck in a wedding dress would be the fucking worst.", "Dude, it\u2019s been no more than 48 hours since they\u2019ve talked. And \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her since then\u201d goes both ways.", "That's fair, I did miss the date that this happened. But she still could have apologized in the last conversation that they had. And frankly she has more of a reason to reach out than the bride since she has the apology to make. The apology can wait until the bride is back from the honeymoon or whatever, but I would say OP is the one who should reach out, not the bride, at least right now. After a long enough time it becomes a stupid thing for the bride to hold a grudge over, but this soon it's on OP to reach out first."]}
