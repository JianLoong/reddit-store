Sounds almost like you\u2019ve been set up by all of them because you have to seriously doubt your husband would have stepped up to do everything that\u2019s being done if you weren\u2019t a part of the equation by choice. All of which only benefits his parents. \n\nAgreeing to move in was your first mistake but since that\u2019s already done and over with, staying in this situation will be your second mistake, and will have far broader consequences for everything pertaining to your marriage. \n\nYou need to get your own family started. Staying in the situation you are in will surly end your marriage because eventually you will be tired of being the hired help and not a wife with a home, privacy and money saved up.

But you shouldn't bring it up later, because then the time has passed, so let bygones be bygones, eh?

Why did you just take this OP? This is where you should have said \"I am really ill and can't cook today, maybe YOUR SON can cook or you can order takeout\". \n\nThey are full grown adults who managed to feed themselves before you came along, they won't starve to death. This behaviour is so entitled it deserved no justification whatsoever from you, but you gave it to them by cooking. Why did you make yourself suffer for people like this? Don't OP, in the end the only person who will pay for it is you. \n\nThey have a lot more to lose from if you moved out than you do - remember that. If you had argued they would have soon been trying to get on your good side again. \n\nYour husband needs a kick up the backside, no way would I let my husband/wife be treated like he has permitted you be. You are the live in maid to his family at this point and after his sitting there in silence and then doubly having the cheek to say you were \"emotional\" - I would be looking to go stay somewhere else for a while if not forever, he can look after his family who clearly are more important to him than you.\n\nValue yourself OP you don't have to take this shit", "I think you obviously know you're NTA, the question is what do you do about it?

After all, what makes you think that this is going to stop after your in-laws are gone, in another decade or so. \n\nIn your in-laws' eyes, I have a feeling that there's no way that you're going to come out the good guy. You're putting your foot down in their house and they already seem like completely entitled hosts. \n\nThis is a make or break situation. Either your husband switches to team-you, or you get your own place and go into couples counseling, which might be a good idea anyway.", "NTA\n\nGo out find a place to live, sign the lease, tell hubby that's where you'll be and he can come and live with you if that's what he wants to do.\n\nMind you - it sounds like he'll do exactly the same thing in your own place that he's doing now - sit around watching TV waiting for you to put dinner on the table and clean the house around him", "You are clearly NTA and your Inlaws and husband are big ones.

He needs to decide who he's going to please: you, or his parents. Tell him to get his ass in the kitchen and make dinner if you're sick. Living with in law is rough even under the best of circumstances, but you're being taken advantage of. Of course they don't want you to leave, they have no bills, a free maid and a cook.

Do you have your own relatives or friends you can go stay with for a bit? Or can you go stay in a short term rental? I know it sounds extreme but if you're not there your in laws and husband will have to work out how to do the cooking and cleaning for themselves, and hopefully it will finally click for your husband how much you're doing for everyone - mind you, I think it could take several weeks. If you stay I guarantee you will continue to be the maid, because the majority (even your husband) are very happy with this arrangement.

Not a good idea, as his parents will expect your marriage to be the same as theirs.  (and theirs is probably shit)   \n\nI would tell your husband he has two choices.

Once we moved here, I picked up a bunch of the household chores because I work from home and I\u2019m here, it just made sense. Slowly over time there\u2019s just been things added here and there and that has snowballed into the current situation.  \n\n- I have stood up for myself a few times, but it\u2019s an incredibly difficult situation\u2026 I\u2019m very aware this is not my house, they are not my parents and the things I would say to my own parents are not the same I feel I could say to his. I moved across the country before we got married none of my friends are here, most of my closest friends are my husbands friends wives etc. I don\u2019t have any family nearby. I\u2019ve always felt as though if I push too hard it would be everyone against me and I didn\u2019t realise before now how toxic of an environment that is. \n\n- The inheritance of the house isn\u2019t something I want / need. This was never supposed to be a long term thing and I guess I\u2019ve just felt pressured to contribute to certain things involving the house because we do live here and my husband will get the house one day (he\u2019s an only child) \n\nOverall it\u2019s just been very eye opening to realise maybe I\u2019m not being as silly as I\u2019m often made to think. All the little things spiral into one big mess and my husband should be sticking up for me not contributing to the problem. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about things several times and he\u2019ll be helpful for a couple of days before resorting back to mummy\u2019s little Prince. \n\nI know I\u2019ve been needing to get out for awhile, I think this is just the push I needed to make such a massive life decision. \n\nThanks Reddit", "Holy hell.

Here\u2019s what helped:\n\nSo, a month ago, we hired a maid service, for the first time ever. Every two weeks at least two women come to my home for a few hours. They\u2019re fabulous. It\u2019s been extremely helpful for all of us, it\u2019s allowed me to choose to do things I want or enjoy, when previously I would spend at least an hour a day doing boring chores. (Side note: \nI lost one of my rings somewhere in the home. I was devastated, leaning towards getting a replacement, heartbroken for a week an a half. I mentioned to them, I lost it\u2026 and lo and behold!! It was found in my laundry room!) \nFor dinner, my mother and I  have used this method for quite some time: those who didn\u2019t cook clean up after dinner. You shouldn\u2019t have to do both cooking and cleaning either That\u2019s just unfair. Give the job to your husband or parents- clearing the table, loading dishes into the dishwasher, cleaning pots and pans, and countertops. We also have a understanding that if clean up person is too exhausted to do the entire job, everyone remains chill and not nagging, if they need to leave the pots and pans in the sink overnight, and that the cleaner will finish them in morning after breakfast.\nThat was for both my mother and I, a hard thing to do, to be ok with the sink of pots and pans.\ud83d\ude09", "NTA however moving out is not going to change much for you because your husband still won't lift a finger to help around the house without you nagging him about it", "Girl, are you Indian?

Just wondering as if you aren't and it's solely your husband that will get the house (which for example in my country where inheritance is NOT included as a marital asset you wouldn't even be entitled to half if you split unless you sold it within the course of the marriage, then the money from the sale would be considered a marital asset but the inheritance itself wouldn't be otherwise**) then you are not only paying for these people to live (you say you are paying all the bills and they have no mortgage so what is it that they are paying for?) but you are also paying to upgrade your husband's future inheritance and you will only benefit from this should you remain married for longer than they remain alive. \n\nUltimately NTA, although personally I wouldn't continue to stay in that situation. If you allow people to walk all over you then that's what they will do and unfortunately it's you who will suffer for it. You have to either put your foot down, and keep it down, or just accept the way you are being treated. It sucks but as adults it's almost*** always our own responsibility to advocate for ourselves and to set our own boundaries.\n\n**Check your own local laws, I'm aware that how it works in my country is not the same as most other places.\n\n***Unless you are literally incapable, such as in a coma, it's *always* your responsibility.
