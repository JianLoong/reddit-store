He knew you were sick. You work too. And he just let you suffer. Even with you telling him, he thought you would just keep serving him.\n\n\n\nEven if you weren't sick, this arragment is highly unfair to you. You husband saves money and doesn't need to lift a finger and your inlaws save money and don't have to lift a finger. \n\n\nChildren living with their parents have chores. These adults are sooo lazy. \n\n\nI'm angry right now. You deserve sooo much better.", "NTA. Sounds like you need a new husband ASAP.", "NTA\n\nAlso, get out now, with or without your husband. Nothing will change because everyone, except you, is fine with the situation. No, your husband doesn\u2019t care, because if he did he would have done something about it. Pack your bags and leave.", "So you got married and instead of starting a family of your own you get to take care of your husbands parents? The exploitation here is outrageous. Sounds almost like you\u2019ve been set up by all of them because you have to seriously doubt your husband would have stepped up to do everything that\u2019s being done if you weren\u2019t a part of the equation by choice. All of which only benefits his parents. \n\nAgreeing to move in was your first mistake but since that\u2019s already done and over with, staying in this situation will be your second mistake, and will have far broader consequences for everything pertaining to your marriage. \n\nYou need to get your own family started. Staying in the situation you are in will surly end your marriage because eventually you will be tired of being the hired help and not a wife with a home, privacy and money saved up. NTA.", "> He thinks I should have brought it up more carefully, at a time when I wasn't so 'emotional'\n\nYes, of course. But you shouldn't bring it up later, because then the time has passed, so let bygones be bygones, eh? So just keep quiet and know your place as the servant.\n\nBasically, your in-laws are making use of you, and your husband just stands by in silence. You're definitely NTA and should move out.", "Wow totally NTA. \n\n>His father had some health issues and needed some care and we agreed to move in to help out.\n\nThat was the first mistake- health issues do not always end, meaning your care role, if you didn't say no would also never end.\n\n> We\u2019ve discussed moving out (I want to) but my in laws are very resistant to the idea, stating that there\u2019s plenty of room here and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019d do without us etc. \n\nWell of course they will be, you are making their lives 1000 times easier and paying most of their bills.\n\n\n>I was woken by my MIL to ask when I was getting up to make dinner. I didn\u2019t want to cause an argument so I just got up and made dinner for them, but as I was in the kitchen struggling not to pass out, the three of them sat watching a movie, waiting for me to bring in their food\n\nIs this not argument worthy? Why did you just take this OP? This is where you should have said \"I am really ill and can't cook today, maybe YOUR SON can cook or you can order takeout\". \n\nThey are full grown adults who managed to feed themselves before you came along, they won't starve to death. This behaviour is so entitled it deserved no justification whatsoever from you, but you gave it to them by cooking. Why did you make yourself suffer for people like this? Don't OP, in the end the only person who will pay for it is you. \n\nThey have a lot more to lose from if you moved out than you do - remember that. If you had argued they would have soon been trying to get on your good side again. \n\nYour husband needs a kick up the backside, no way would I let my husband/wife be treated like he has permitted you be. You are the live in maid to his family at this point and after his sitting there in silence and then doubly having the cheek to say you were \"emotional\" - I would be looking to go stay somewhere else for a while if not forever, he can look after his family who clearly are more important to him than you.\n\nValue yourself OP you don't have to take this shit", "I think you obviously know you're NTA, the question is what do you do about it? Half of the problem (at least half) is actually your husband. \n\nIf I were you (which I realize I'm not) I'd basically tell him that unless this slave treatment of you stops, you'll move out on your own. After all, what makes you think that this is going to stop after your in-laws are gone, in another decade or so. \n\nIn your in-laws' eyes, I have a feeling that there's no way that you're going to come out the good guy. You're putting your foot down in their house and they already seem like completely entitled hosts. \n\nThis is a make or break situation. Either your husband switches to team-you, or you get your own place and go into couples counseling, which might be a good idea anyway.", "NTA\n\nGo out find a place to live, sign the lease, tell hubby that's where you'll be and he can come and live with you if that's what he wants to do.\n\nMind you - it sounds like he'll do exactly the same thing in your own place that he's doing now - sit around watching TV waiting for you to put dinner on the table and clean the house around him", "You are clearly NTA and your Inlaws and husband are big ones. Move out, I'd recommend alone and leave your husband with all those household duties. If he can't stand up for you, he can take over and care of his family on his own.", "NTA, but everyone else is - especially your husband. you should try presenting the situation to him this way - either you two move out together or you will move out alone. See how he reacts.", "Move out without the deadbeat husband.", "They don't treat you like a maid... to them, you are a maid.. \n\nThey are holding that house like a carrot in front of you.

He needs to decide who he's going to please: you, or his parents. Tell him to get his ass in the kitchen and make dinner if you're sick. Living with in law is rough even under the best of circumstances, but you're being taken advantage of. Of course they don't want you to leave, they have no bills, a free maid and a cook. I have a difficult MIL and if my husband didn't always defend me and stand up to her it would've ruined our marriage. You need to get out of there before it does serious damage to your relationship.", "NTA\n\nI would have dumped the meal on the floor in front of them.", ">He thinks I should have brought it up more carefully\n\nBut....u did. Literally yesterday...\n\nYour husband is turn up just like his family\n\n>i want to move out but husband and inlaws are still against it,\n\nOn what basis? That you won't be their maid anymore? Huge NTA for wanting to move out after being treated like that. Your husband also not helping you, figuratively and literally.", "NTA. Do you have your own relatives or friends you can go stay with for a bit? Or can you go stay in a short term rental? I know it sounds extreme but if you're not there your in laws and husband will have to work out how to do the cooking and cleaning for themselves, and hopefully it will finally click for your husband how much you're doing for everyone - mind you, I think it could take several weeks. If you stay I guarantee you will continue to be the maid, because the majority (even your husband) are very happy with this arrangement. I suspect the only way your husband is going to stand up for you is if he becomes very uncomfortable eg having to do your jobs because you're not there.", "NTA  \nYou need to get out of here as soon as possible. These people are not on your side, they are not kind, they are not fair. They are using you and the way I see it: when they are done sucking all the money and free chores they can, you will be left in the dust: this house will never be yours, don't spend your money on it, don't be a slave in this house, you are not respected and valued. I'm angry for you, and boy are they lucky you are so nice.   \nFor me this marriage is already over, no respect, no love. Good luck.", "NTA. Make a chore chart. Literally designate certain chores to people- \u201cthis is everyone\u2019s home, everyone helps maintain it.\u201d Old people aren\u2019t incapable and doing chores keeps them active and a participant. And don\u2019t budge. If someone doesn\u2019t do a chore, it doesn\u2019t get done. I assume you aren\u2019t American (?), so some of this might be harder to do.", "NTA as you stated it appears that you are being made to work like a maid with the so called promise of inheriting the house but they could change their mind any day as well. Also for how long is this expected to continue. Its better to move out and have your own place where at least the work will be a lot less and you get to do as you want to. Everyone needs a break and what you are going through will eventually lead to health problems, stress, burnout and possibly mental breakdown. Might be worth just stopping doing what you do and tell your husband to pay the rent as it would be cheaper and you can cook just for you and your husband or get a takeout. What you are having is not a life many would choose.", "NTA  \"His father had some health issues and needed some care and we agreed to move in to help out.\"   THAT is where your problem started.  He's not your problem.   On top of that, a marriage can not survive if the couple live too close to any of the parental units.   Living in the same house?  Not a good idea, as his parents will expect your marriage to be the same as theirs.  (and theirs is probably shit)   \n\nI would tell your husband he has two choices.  You two move out into a place of your own FAR away from his parents no later than August of this year.  Or, you file for divorce and you move out on your own, far away from everybody in August of this year.  Even if you don't want a divorce, that's where this is headed if nothing changes soon.", "NTA.

If husband doesn't agree, don't take him with you when you move out.", "NTA, and if your husband isn't firmly on your side with this, then this might be a \"two cards\" situation. \n\nYou need to take him aside for a serious talk and set an ultimatum: this cannot go on and you refuse to be abused by this one-sided relationship any further. You *will* be moving out and he has two choices, moving with you and getting marriage counselling, or divorce.", "Doing chores around the house isn't \"helping you\", OP. Your husband and in-laws are taking advantage of you. You rightfully called his mum out and now she got butt hurt.

They are treating you like the maid. Time to stop shopping, cleaning, cooking and doing any chores for anyone but yourself. Go on strike.\nYour husband is the biggest AH here. Why don\u2019t you go and stay somewhere else for a while?", "NTA - it\u2019s fine if your husband doesn\u2019t want to move out. You can move out by yourself and let them take care of themselves because they definitely don\u2019t care about you.", "NTA. You need to move out. Leave this house with or without your husband.", "nta you should move out with or without your husband maybe if he had to take on even half of what you do he might think differently", "NTA   - It's time to give your husband an ultimatum.  Either you both move out or you are going.  You are basically paying for everything with the house and doing all the work, what do you get out of it.", "NTA.\n\nPut your foot down and stop doing it. If it helps, create a chore chart and weekly menu (people cook on different days) and be firm in the stance that you will NOT be carrying their weight anymore.\n\nYou deserve to rest and feel like people appreciate what you do for them, and right now, you do not feel both. \n\nThe lack of action from your husband also suggests that he only said he would help to appease you rather than support you. Have a long conversation with him, and next time, do not agree when he says you're being emotional!\n\nHim calling you emotional undermines your feelings. Do not allow him to undermine how you feel. You have every right to feel and be angry at your situation!\n\nNext time, they mention the house being dirty, feign ignorance, and just say; \"oh yeah, now that you mention it, it is.\" Then walk away. Pigs who live in a sty will quickly clean up after themselves.", "NTA. Stop doing all of it. Stop cleaning. Stop cooking for them - husband included. Start apartment hunting. He can either move with you ( if you still want him , I don't blame you if you don't) or stay with his parents.", "NTA\n\nPlease get out now. Your husband will not improve over time but will only get worse. He has no interest in caring about you as you being the family maid serves him well and he isn\u2019t required to put any effort into the relationship. \n\nIf you can, find somewhere you can afford on your own and tell your husband that either he moves out with you or he calls an end to the marriage and you both go your separate ways.", "Yes, I was thinking that they can't be that old with a son of that age.  The FIL might have had some health issues, but they aren't completely incapable.  They probably aren't close to sixty yet.\n\nThey've got a lot of years to go."]}
