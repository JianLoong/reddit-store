Sounds almost like you\u2019ve been set up by all of them because you have to seriously doubt your husband would have stepped up to do everything that\u2019s being done if you weren\u2019t a part of the equation by choice, all of which only benefits his parents. \n\nAgreeing to move in was your first mistake but since that\u2019s already done and over with, staying in this situation will be your second mistake, and will have far broader consequences for everything pertaining to your marriage. \n\nYou need to get your own family started. Staying in the situation you are in will surly end your marriage because eventually you will be tired of being the hired help and not a wife with a home, privacy and money saved up.

But you shouldn't bring it up later, because then the time has passed, so let bygones be bygones, eh?

Why did you just take this OP? This is where you should have said \"I am really ill and can't cook today, maybe YOUR SON can cook or you can order takeout\". \n\nThey are full grown adults who managed to feed themselves before you came along, they won't starve to death. This behaviour is so entitled it deserved no justification whatsoever from you, but you gave it to them by cooking. Why did you make yourself suffer for people like this? Don't OP, in the end the only person who will pay for it is you. \n\nThey have a lot more to lose from if you moved out than you do - remember that. If you had argued they would have soon been trying to get on your good side again. \n\nYour husband needs a kick up the backside, no way would I let my husband/wife be treated like he has permitted you be. You are the live in maid to his family at this point and after his sitting there in silence and then doubly having the cheek to say you were \"emotional\" - I would be looking to go stay somewhere else for a while if not forever, he can look after his family who clearly are more important to him than you.\n\nValue yourself OP you don't have to take this shit", "I think you obviously know you're NTA, the question is what do you do about it?

After all, what makes you think that this is going to stop after your in-laws are gone, in another decade or so. \n\nIn your in-laws' eyes, I have a feeling that there's no way that you're going to come out the good guy. You're putting your foot down in their house and they already seem like completely entitled hosts. \n\nThis is a make or break situation. Either your husband switches to team-you, or you get your own place and go into couples counseling, which might be a good idea anyway.", "NTA\n\nGo out find a place to live, sign the lease, tell hubby that's where you'll be and he can come and live with you if that's what he wants to do.\n\nMind you - it sounds like he'll do exactly the same thing in your own place that he's doing now - sit around watching TV waiting for you to put dinner on the table and clean the house around him", "You are clearly NTA and your Inlaws and husband are big ones.

He needs to decide who he's going to please: you, or his parents. Tell him to get his ass in the kitchen and make dinner if you're sick. Living with in law is rough even under the best of circumstances, but you're being taken advantage of. Of course they don't want you to leave, they have no bills, a free maid and a cook.

Huge NTA for wanting to move out after being treated like that. Your husband also not helping you, figuratively and literally.", "NTA. Do you have your own relatives or friends you can go stay with for a bit? Or can you go stay in a short term rental? I know it sounds extreme but if you're not there your in laws and husband will have to work out how to do the cooking and cleaning for themselves, and hopefully it will finally click for your husband how much you're doing for everyone - mind you, I think it could take several weeks. If you stay I guarantee you will continue to be the maid, because the majority (even your husband) are very happy with this arrangement. I suspect the only way your husband is going to stand up for you is if he becomes very uncomfortable eg having to do your jobs because you're not there.", "NTA  \nYou need to get out of here as soon as possible.

Also for how long is this expected to continue. Its better to move out and have your own place where at least the work will be a lot less and you get to do as you want to. Everyone needs a break and what you are going through will eventually lead to health problems, stress, burnout and possibly mental breakdown.

He's not your problem.   On top of that, a marriage can not survive if the couple live too close to any of the parental units.   Living in the same house?  Not a good idea, as his parents will expect your marriage to be the same as theirs.  (and theirs is probably shit)   \n\nI would tell your husband he has two choices.  You two move out into a place of your own FAR away from his parents no later than August of this year.

Each family contributes equal sum since both families contain same number of people.\n\n2) The chores must be divided by a)how much time they take to do per week and b) who is in the house so they can easiest perform them.

This WILL mean equal time spent doing chores per adult.\n\n3) And for the love of God, if you are to live together as a family, you must love and respect each other enough as to help someone out when they are temporarily sick.

Once we moved here, I picked up a bunch of the household chores because I work from home and I\u2019m here, it just made sense.

All the little things spiral into one big mess and my husband should be sticking up for me not contributing to the problem.
