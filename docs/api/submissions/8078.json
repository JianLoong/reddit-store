We have a venue and everything picked out. Everything seemed fine until we told his parents. His mother automatically showed distaste at where we chose and told me that she would not enjoy the wedding since a lot of police officers would be there. She has strong feelings, his whole side of the family does, about the police and didn't know I was a police officer. I told her that it would not be fair to just uninvite ally friends and coworkers because of her feelings. She became mad, not only that I wouldn't listen but also that I was police. I told her that we were not bad but she wouldn't listen so over the phone I told her that she was uninvited from the wedding since she wanted to make this all about herself and her family over what we as a couple wanted before we got into an argument and she called me an asshole.

This is his family we\u2019re talking about and to not even run it by him is just not ok. \n\nAlso making a stink about having to travel and the profession and being rude about it also sucks. (Dictating someone\u2019s guest list also is not ok)\n\nYou both just kind of suck, you both have put your fianc\u00e9 in the middle of things without looping him in and made this experience less happy for him as a result.\n\nEdit: OP has stated in the comments that fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t around for this call so they unilaterally decided to just uninvited future MIL.

She overreacted & was rude.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should be speaking with his mother & his family. Those are his people. Arguing to defend your profession has nothing to do with your wedding. If she chooses not to attend because of her experiences with the police, that\u2019s not personal to you. Your fianc\u00e9 should have been included in this conversation before it escalated to uninviting & name calling\n\neta \u2014 btw your fianc\u00e9 & you kept this \u201cjob\u201d information from his family intentionally because of \u201cstrong feelings\u201d so I\u2019m not sure why you expected a different outcome when she found out she was going to be surrounded by police officers.

You need to talk to your fiance.\n\nHowever your future MIL needs to realize that it's not about her, it's about you and your fiance. Yes, police in France as an institution also has its issues but they're not nearly as severe as in the US (mainly because of gun laws, I assume). I'm from Germany and I think our police is pretty similar to your's and your future MIL is definitely overreacting. Someone needs to explain it to her.", "YTA. A counselor told my husband that anything to do with his parents has to come from HIM.", "Just like its your job to manage and interact with your family/friends on your fiance's behalf, it's also your fiance's job to manage and interact with his family on your behalf.  In this situation he should be taking lead in talking to his mother and if he wants her uninvited it should be his action and not yours.  Not doing this leads to far greater problems in the future.\n\nI would recommend talking to your fiance about his mom and her attitude.  If he agrees that she should not be invited, he needs to contact his family and tell them to back off and its his decision.  If he disagrees with you, since its an action you took you should be the person who reverses it.\n\nI don't see this as an ahole situation, NAH.  I think your position is reasonable but it was executed incorrectly and without your partner's input.", "This is a tough one. \n\nMany people have very complicated relationships with police, both as an institutional authority and also with the history and ongoing violence that particular communities feel from the police. The US is especially sensitive to this topic. \n\nWhile I think you're well within your right to have whomever you want to attend your wedding, I think you have *some* misdirected anger with your future MIL. How is it that you and your fiance are engaged and your FMIL didn't know what you did for work? It's not like you work in some niche specialized field that is hard to sum up for a person, you work as a police officer. So clearly either you or your SO played a part in shielding her from knowing about your profession knowing that it would upset her. \n\nUltimately, NTA because you're not wrong for wanting the people who love you and your partner and support you two to be there on the day of your wedding. But I do think that this was a situation where you and your fiance should have made this decision together.", "NTA. Look, I understand how in the US people can have some very complicated feelings about the police. But 1. you are not a US police officer (nor are your friends) and 2. this woman obviously doesn't know you or your friends very well. It's not like she just found out you guys are all friends from a dog fighting ring or something. If this is the hill she wants to die on, that's her choice. I sympathize with her relationship with police but if she won't even try to get to know you or your friends, she's not being fair.", "NTA - BUT your fianc\u00e9 should have handled this.

It should not be about your mother in low. And to judge people because of their job is not okay.\n\nMaybe talk to your fiance. And he might can explain to his mother that the police in France is kind of different than in the US (?). I think (please correct me, if I'm wrong. I live in another European country) - longer police school, not shooting thoughless ...", "NTA if you talked with your fiancee before doing it.", "NTA. If I had to guess (and I don't but I will), his mother has a bad taste over police because of the reputation the US Police Forces have. She is probably unaware that in Europe, they're not like that.\n\nI'd also point out that if your MIL didn't know you were a police officer (your literal job) then she definitely does not know you very well at all. If you were closer I'd have issues over you uninvited her from the wedding just like that but it's pretty clear your relationship was practically nothing already.", "NTA\n\nThis wedding isn't about her, its about you and your fiance. \n\nIf she's ignorant enough to cause this much of a stink over what someone does for a living, then she can just stay her happy hind end at home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
