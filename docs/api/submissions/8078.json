We have a venue and everything picked out. Everything seemed fine until we told his parents. His mother automatically showed distaste at where we chose and told me that she would not enjoy the wedding since a lot of police officers would be there. She has strong feelings, his whole side of the family does, about the police and didn't know I was a police officer. I told her that it would not be fair to just uninvite ally friends and coworkers because of her feelings. She became mad, not only that I wouldn't listen but also that I was police. I told her that we were not bad but she wouldn't listen so over the phone I told her that she was uninvited from the wedding since she wanted to make this all about herself and her family over what we as a couple wanted before we got into an argument and she called me an asshole. It's been a couple days now and I've been ignoring every call from her since but I'm wondering if I'm the asshole.\nEdit: I didn't notify him when it happened and I still haven't told him yet as he is on a work trip and not around.\nEdit #2: Fiance just came home from work trip, and he said that he didn't mind  the fact that I uninvited her as she would cause problems most likely.

So now uninvite yourself because well, you're a police officer too? Which is most likely her preference.   \nFor those disagreeing with you, she put you on the spot and treated you like garbage. Words have consequences. Good she can experience that in a way she deserves.   \nAs for reasoning with her, you can't reason with her based on how she feels about police.
