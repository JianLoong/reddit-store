Your daughter was 18 when she left and you claim it was because of religious differences. She was a young adult exploring herself, and she felt she had to get out of your space to do that. Instead of supporting her through that journey, you banned her from coming back. Effectively pushing her toward the very man that traumatized you.

That\u2019s your kid. She told you she didn\u2019t have other options than to live with him, because you banished her from your home. You had the baby with the man, so it\u2019s definitely on you that her father is like that.

Your boundaries are idiotic and abusive.  This is your daughter who went through trauma.  You just want to say \"I told you so.\" Fine.  You told us.\n\nYou were right all along.  Good for you.\n\nNow your own daughter wants to talk to you and discuss things with you.  Your job is to be the bigger person, put your pride aside, and relate to her.  Help her.  Dear God woman, this is *your own daughter*!\n\nDid you ever read the part in the Bible where Jesus says \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you?\"\n\nHave you read any of the parables, how about the prodigal son?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Prodigal Son is a parable from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically from the Gospel of Luke. It tells the story of a younger son who asks his father for his share of the inheritance, then goes to a distant country and squanders all his wealth in loose living. When a famine arises, the son realizes he has nothing left and decides to return to his father and ask for forgiveness, willing to work as a hired servant.  As the son is returning, his father sees him from a distance, runs to him, and embraces him. The father is overjoyed and orders a feast to be prepared in his son's honor. The older son, who has remained loyal and worked for his father, becomes angry and refuses to join the celebration. The father explains that they should celebrate because the younger son was lost and is now found, and was dead but is alive again. The parable illustrates the themes of repentance, forgiveness, and unconditional love. It highlights the father's unconditional love and forgiveness towards his wayward son, regardless of his mistakes and shortcomings. It also raises questions about jealousy, forgiveness, and the importance of showing mercy and compassion towards others. Overall, the story teaches about the redemptive power of forgiveness and the importance of reconciliation and restoration in relationships.", "YTA are you fucking serious op", "YTA, you should understand better than most about the poor decisions naive teenagers sometimes make \n\nYour religion has obvious not taught you compassion, forgiveness, or understanding\n\nYou should at least help your daughter find individual counseling/therapy and consider doing family therapy unless you want her to effectively have no family", "YTA.

Was she stupid as she went ahead despite all your warnings? Yes, but she's young, misguided, and didn't do it out of malice but seeking to understand her own life. Support her in a way that won't destroy you. Offer to pay for therapy perhaps?\n\nI also urge you, if you haven't yet, to avail of therapy yourself, for the past trauma with your ex, and to help you sort of your feelings with this development with your daughter. Your ex has soiled your past, don't allow him to soil your present and future with your only child, especially if your relationship has been pretty good before she left. At least do a few sincere attempts to resolve this conflict before writing her off due to your (understandable) sense of self-preservation.

She chose to live with him despite my warnings, and I've done nothing but try to put that chapter of my life behind me. I don't want to reopen old wounds by discussing it with my daughter. If she was still living with him it would be a different story, but she got out on her own and is fine now. \n\nShe hasn't taken my response well.
