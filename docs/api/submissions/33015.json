I know you have this rule but these weren\u2019t just leftovers from a restaurant. It was an entire meal that she was looking forward to but couldn\u2019t eat because of her nausea. Honestly you should have asked if she was saving it for herself before you ate it. You\u2019re also rude for not telling her after you ate it. She was getting excited for a meal that didn\u2019t exist anymore. You should\u2019ve let her know so she didn\u2019t get so excited and let down over it. I really don\u2019t think she\u2019s mad because you ate the steak. She\u2019s mad because you handled everything in a really inconsiderate way.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t touch pregnat womens food, never\nEven if she is the AH, you are still the bigger AH for touching her food.\n\nNothing else matters \n\nDon\u2019t touch the food", "There\u2019s no AH. You guys made an agreement, but this was pre pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones means she\u2019s going to cry. Food it going to be primal and if she can\u2019t have what her mouth craves in that moment she is going to cry.", "And suspend the food rule through her pregnancy. There is no rational thought with the addition of hormones. Congratulations OP!", "This is the right answer, Officer.", "For real. \"I'm sorry honey I'll get you some more steak.\" and some flowers/and or chocolate and a foot massage. This is husbanding 101 and I ain't even married yet.", "He could've at least asked her before he ate it. I know they have a rule about leftovers being free for anyone, but this wasn't even technically leftovers since she didn't eat any of it to begin with.", "Yup, and just to add for future lessons\u2026\n\nNEVER eat the last of something unless you ask for permission and have a plan to replace the whole bag/box/etc. \n\nI normally don\u2019t care, but man\u2026when I was pregnant, my husband ate the last of the haagen-daz ice cream I saved for myself without telling me in the middle of the heat wave. I ugly cried.  Normally I would have just shrugged and go buy more, but not that day. Husband was smart enough to jump in the car right then and go to Costco\u2019s and buy me a big box. From then on, if it\u2019s the last one, he\u2019ll ask if I wanted it before he eat it\u2026and that was 7 years ago.", "All of this. Being constantly ill during early pregnancy is a nightmare. The first time I could eat solid food (a bagel with cream cheese) after 10 weeks of misery, I cried. Just apologize and be kind, pregnancy can really really suck.", "As an overly emotional pregnant woman,  I thank you for this!", "flowers made me nauseous and smelled like garbage when i was pregnant so maybe not that", "You must be the best husband!!  Lucky wife!\n\nOp listen to him, he's got it", "She doesn't want a new steak or flowers that the scent of will make her vomit-she wanted the steak that she had been thinking about all day.", "Don't get flowers get steak lol", "I remember almost crying over apple pie\u2026.. I was craving it for 2 weeks and i couldn\u2019t find it and didn\u2019t want to deal with the traffic due to construction. It was a very specific pie type the ones you find in a tin at Walmart or target. I almost had a freaking meltdown at target thinking they didn\u2019t have it lol I was in my first trimester too", "Agree", "Or breastfeeding", "Yeah he should have just asked first", "Well not really, food don\u2019t magically stay good in the fridge until the pregnant lady decide to eat it. It\u2019s impossible to know when she will want the leftover, is OP suppose to let food go bad because maybe his wife will want to eat in 5 days - 10 days, two weeks? It\u2019s been a week since the food was ordered at the restaurant when she decided to eat it. Depending on humidity in the doggy bag and how each food item was stored, it might have beginning to turn bad and smell weird after 7 days in the fridge. \n\nNAH in this, OP need to cook up a steak, but he did nothing wrong by eating it when he did.", "Right.  OP should have waited at least a week, until the food got stinky, then thrown it away.", "Honestly *this* is more of an asshole move than eating the food in the first place.\n\nYes, the \"rule\" was in place, but pregnancy is a special case.  He should have asked.  He didn't.   His wife is upset.   And I don't blame her.   I have dealt with illness and food aversion, and I will say that, when you can't keep anything down, the food you feel OK to eat, when you feel OK to eat it is a NEED, not a want.   OF COURSE she's upset.   Now is not the time to quote \"the rules\" at her.\n\nOP needs to consider the circumstances, take the L and apologize profusely.", "Try 15 seconds", "Agreed. Also, is it even \u201cleftovers\u201d if it\u2019s the entire meal?", "Exactly. Tell your sick pregnant wife that *technically* her meal was no longer hers? YTA, bub.", ">and I was really wanting some more steak.\n\nSo did she!", "Honestly, even if she wasn\u2019t pregnant. If I\u2019m too sick to eat my restaurant ordered fancy food, and I\u2019m too sick for over 36 hours, I\u2019m still banking on that food being mine. She was sick. She wasn\u2019t not eating it bc she wasn\u2019t interested or found something better, she was not eating it bc she physically couldn\u2019t", "It doesn't sound like they established any 'special pregnancy rules.' Also he offered to buy her fresh steak, which she turned down. Pregnancy hormones mess with emotions.", "Right. I think the standard is 3-4 days in an airtight container not the to go box. 2 days would be the max for me.", "This needs to be higher up. Everyone is so busy lambasting the OP that they're not considering the fact that the original dinner was nearly a week before. That food wouldn't have been good to eat a week after the original date, even if the OP hadn't eaten it. I understand that the wife is preggo, but this food would have just been thrown out, had the OP not eaten it.\n\nETA: I'm pretty sure that people are reading the 36-hour thing, and are assuming that the leftovers were only two days old. If the dinner was nearly a week ago, and the wife only felt better in the last day or so, that can reasonably be judged as the dinner occurring five or six days ago. Those leftovers would not still be edible.", "I feel like that \"Don't take food from a pregnant woman\" ought to be on a banner at the top of this subreddit and written on bumper stickers/t-shirts/etc. It's just a rule to live by.", "And, at least for me, I had no idea which food was going to be 'yes' or 'no' moment by moment.  For one of my pregnancies, I could not eat eggs at all.  I could eat chicken, but I couldn't deal with cooking it. It's so weird!", "Comparing chemo to pregnancy is crazy", "I absolutely would now, but not when I was pregnant. And especially in a high risk pregnancy.", "I'll agree with NAH this time   There better NOT be a next time.  Pregnancy is hard and when you have HEG, it's torture.", "Yeah, I'd consider her point of view if it wasn't *a week ago* that they bought the food. Leftovers from a restaurant are only good for 3, 4 days TOPS, and that is pushing it. I would not want my pregnant wife to chance it. OP is NTA on a purely food safety basis. Besides which, he offered to go get the same food, but fresh. She's being unreasonable.", "That's what I was thinking. Two day old steak reheated might not even be healthy for a pregnant woman. Food delivery apps exist, and I'd personally rather have something hot and fresh than reheated after being sick for so long. \n\nI got the wife is hormonal and upset but everyone here acting like OP committed a mortal sin need to calm down.", "I had hyperemis gravidarum and what I could stand to smelll/eat/keep in my stomach changed in a moment. \n\nI remember having lots of things around to eat that hopefully I could keep down while also having super high risk pregnancy and my sister in law began eating the carrots. I got so mad - don't eat the pregnant woman' s food.\n\nIt's been 25 years and I am cool if others eat 'my leftovers' if they ask.   Being pregnant makes things really hard when your body acts the way mine did", "You have a lot of misplaced rage over this. The guy was following the house rules and while he should have checked with his wife on this one, eating leftover isn't \"greedily stuffing \\[his\\] face.\" Her reaction is also completely normal, given the crazy hormones bouncing around in her. There's nothing selfish or even AH about what the guy did -- it was boneheaded, and you need to chill out with the man-hate.", "I think this rule is great!  I imagine it really cuts down on food waste.  We have a similar (in spirit) rule in our house, namely that unless I tell my husband that a leftover is off limits, it\u2019s his job to eat it before it goes bad. Wasting food makes him anxious and he has no problem eating random leftovers for lunch or a snack. He gets fed, I have a clean fridge, we have very little waste. Win, win, win.", "Yeah we have never taken each other leftovers without asking, even the kids. I would offer sometimes to my husband but we just keep away from each overs.", "When I was pregnant I cried basically anytime I even thought of a child. \n\nI cried because I was so happy my 5 year old has friends (he\u2019s super gregarious and has never not had friends). \n\nI cried because there existed a group home in my town (so sad for those kids!) \n\nI cried because I saw a video of someone helping a family of ducks cross the street. \n\nI cried every time I saw encanto, and my son was obsessed so this was literally dozens of times. \n\nI cried because I gave birth in December and my poor baby would think that the world was such a cold place (I wore him and wrapped him up so well I don\u2019t think he even felt cold until he was 1.)\n\nIt got to the point where if my husband saw me crying, he\u2019d ask if he could help, hand me a snack, and then just go back to what he was doing.", "Steak is fine for 3-4 days in the fridge.\n\nI often cook up a bunch of steak on the grill on Monday, it gets used for meals through Friday evening, any extra goes out with the trash on Friday night.\n\nIn fact, we are having steak sandwiches with steak grilled Monday for dinner tonight.", "Wtf are you even talking about. Food does not spill just because it's 3 days old.", "Yeah totally i won\u2019t even touch food that was cooked more than an hour ago /s", "Some people have to stick their hands in the fire, so to speak. I mean, when my wife was pregnant, all I could think about was how to make the process easier for her. \n\nShe actually got mad at me because, according to her, \"I'm not porcelain, stop treating me like it.\" \n\nYes, dear.", "This was my question, did he even ask?", "My roommate accidentally grabbed my ice cream and ate it. And when I went looking for it I was SO MAD. \n\nHe went pale, swore, and then ran to the store and was back in just under 15 minutes with a fresh pint.
