I won't be in any of the wedding photos either. So reading all this I was like cool, I'll RSVP no and have a nice day doing my own thing. I have no interest in attending a wedding where I will be stuck around people I do not know and celebrating someone I do not like. Which is exactly what I did. I sent my RSVP back via a link that was listed on the invite.\n\nThe rest of my family, even seeing the letter she wrote after they confronted me, believe I am wrong for RSVPing no. Mom said I could have gone to her and dad and they would have straightened out the details in the note, my grandparents said I could still enjoy spending time with them and the rest of the family, my aunt said I am going to raise a lot of eyebrows by not attending my own sister's wedding and will make them all look bad.\n\nI told them she clearly doesn't want me there. I clearly don't want to be there. So why would I go. They all responded that as an adult we all do things we don't always want to do. Which fair.

The hard part is figuring out which is which. This is definitely the latter.", "Maybe it's because I've been reading the petty revenge subgroup, but I think you should go. Introduce yourself to all of her friends and in-laws as her sister, make a point to walk over to your family's table to talk but not sit down, and pointedly walk back to your reject table and sit. Photobomb as many group photos at the reception, since you won't be in any of the \"official\" family pics. Hell, get up and grab the mic after someone's speech to make a cameo, like \"hi I'm the brides sister, I just wanted to say I'm so happy to see all my family here together and to meet all of our new extended family! Thanks!\" Then take the loooonnngggg way back to your loser table seat.

The rest of your family can kick rocks.", "NTA. Sister is giving off golden child vibes.", "NTA. Who cares what your family thinks. Don't go.", "NTA you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Plan a vacation or a little getaway during the wedding and then your phone off. Your sister wrote that note so your would say no.  You said no and that is that. Why would you go to a wedding where you would be answering questions all night that would cause more drama.  I would write to your sister and tell her you respect her boundaries and would like her to respect yours and to please tell family to back off.", "How could you \"spend time with them\" if you are not even seated with them?\n\nIt sounds like your sister told them that she wasn't going to invite you and they pressured her with the same bullshit they are trying now with you.  FAMILY!!\n\nShe clearly doesn't want you there so stand firm with your convictions.\n\nSide note:  What the hell happened between you two to have this much animosity?", "NTA. She sent you an invitation so your family wouldn\u2019t have a go at her for not inviting you.

It's her wedding.  If she doesn't care if you are absent, why would anyone else?", "NTA, visit your grandparents at another time and tell your aunts or anyone else that you're not interested in, nor is it not your job to maintain the appearance of a happy family.", "NTA, your sister clearly started this particular chain of events, they should all be voicing their disappointment at her.", "BTA, you both need to grow up", "NTA and as an adult, you can decide whether or not you're going to attend something you're  clearly not wanted at. She went out of her way to make sure you knew you weren't family and you won't be treated as such. If anything your family should be telling your sister to grow tf up, and instead of sending passive-aggressive invites out, maybe she just shouldn't bother sending anything.", "NTA. I have an extremely strained relationship with my sister. If she were to every re-marry, I doubt to see an invitation, but I would say \"no\". My guess is she would send the invite out of obligation seeing I am her 'sister', and not because she wants me there. Your family needs to respect your choice. Maybe they won't understand, but they don't *need* to understand. They just need to respect the 'no' and let it alone.", "NTA your family sounds toxic AF.

I surely would not be going. NTA. Your family is wack for not defending you.", "NTA. IDK how your relatives think that you not being there will look worse than you being there and clearly consigned to the \u201calso attending\u201d table in the back. You\u2019re actually saving your sister from making a public show of her disdain for you at her wedding, and your family from a public airing of your conflict\u2019s existence.\n\nHave a lovely day out.", "NTA. You don\u2019t like each other, sounds like you\u2019ve never liked each other, so it\u2019s totally acceptable.

I\u2019d like to know which sis betrayed the other sister to begin with but I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA.  If they want you there so bad they need to discuss that with your sister and then have your sister call you. \n\nHonestly I still wouldn't go even if your sister called and said she wants you there - who wants to be at a family wedding when you're not wanted or treated as family.", "\"my aunt said I am going to raise a lot of eyebrows by not attending my own sister's wedding and will make them all look bad.\"\n\nYou sitting a a non family table will have the same effect. \n\nNTA \nAs an adult you get to decide if you want to go or not. No is an appropriate response.", "NTA OP but tell your parents and grandparents if they are worried about what people would say about your not being there, ask your family, won't they (people) wonder about your not being seated with family members or being included in family photos.  And how would your Dad get  your sister to change her mind, it is **her** wedding after all?!  You should also tell them that if you did go and there was no changes, that you wouldn't hesitate to tell people the truth when asked why you weren't included in the family activities (sitting with family, taking family photos, etc...).  So it's best for all that you don't attend, they could always make an excuse for your not being there (sick) instead of telling everyone the truth.", "You are NOT wrong in anyway or form. The way you're invited to the wedding is nasty and uncalled for...clearly she doesn't want you there and only invited you so she doesn't have to face the family's questioning.

BUT when my issue is with the person being celebrated, I think being the adult means RSVPing no. OP likely only got invited out of obligation, so I would politely decline and absolve both of us of having to tolerate each other's presence.", "Agreed; if they would not want this information public, then they shouldn\u2019t be excusing it.", "I would say the bride did this. SHE sent the rude invite so SHE can accept the consequences. At this point, forcing OP to go may be a sure fire way to have a major blowup at the wedding. That would really make the family look good.", "It doesn't even make sense! If I attended a wedding and the bride's sister wasn't there, I'd assume there was a good reason. If I attended a wedding and the bride's sister was there but hidden at a random far away table instead of with the rest of the family? THAT I'd raise my eyebrows about.", "I like how you think!", "I love your petty", "Yeah, as a guest I'd automatically assume something was up and ask either the bride or OP why she isn't with family...wedding day or not, you don't just exclude a family member you invite.\n\nPersonally I'd just never invite the family member I dislike...[though I'm a doormat so I'd probably get pressured to anyway...not do what OP's sister did though]", "> if she's not going to treat you like family, why should you be expected to act like family?\n\nThis is the answer.", "And left out of family pictures!", "But I bet the sister did it this way to get to play innocent ay the wedding \"I invited OP, but she heartlessly chose not to come.\" I'm sure that's why my sister invited me and my husband to her up coming wedding but excluded our kids but made it crystal clear to me thst she was inviting other kids to the wedding. \n\nThe you'll make us look bad if you don't go is classic narcissist attitude.", "I would tell the aunt that being there and excluded from all the family photos ect will look worse and be harder to explain.

If 'face' is more important to them than OP, OP can be more important to themself than family 'face'.", "OR,.....after mom and dad fix things and you are seated with family,  GO, wearing an absolutely  gorgeous gown, \nWear your prettiest sparkly jewelry, and   dance and enjoy yourself.

SO gross.", "Yes, Grandmother and Parents can sit the table for extra guests, or even outside, *because as adults we all do things we don't want to do*.", "I actually started typing something similar to this, but realized it's really too late now. If mom and dad told sis to be the adult and be more accepting of OP even though she doesn't want to, I still wouldn't go. If sis doesn't want me there, I'm out.\nShake the dust off your feet OP and move on from the sister situation. She's TA. You are NTA for sure.\nDon't let the family put the guilt on you when it's your sister who who is TA.", "The parents/family saying that is really along the lines of \u201cbecause I said so\u201d.", "And at this time family will not get what they want", ">But I bet the sister did it this way to get to play innocent ay the wedding\n\nOh, I 100% agree with that!", "Yeah this feels incomplete"]}
