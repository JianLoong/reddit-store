I have no interest in attending a wedding where I will be stuck around people I do not know and celebrating someone I do not like. Which is exactly what I did. I sent my RSVP back via a link that was listed on the invite.\n\nThe rest of my family, even seeing the letter she wrote after they confronted me, believe I am wrong for RSVPing no. Mom said I could have gone to her and dad and they would have straightened out the details in the note, my grandparents said I could still enjoy spending time with them and the rest of the family, my aunt said I am going to raise a lot of eyebrows by not attending my own sister's wedding and will make them all look bad.\n\nI told them she clearly doesn't want me there. I clearly don't want to be there. So why would I go. They all responded that as an adult we all do things we don't always want to do. Which fair.
