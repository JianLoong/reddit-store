The most popular Sunday school for adults was the seekers class. Pelt who were unsure exactly if their faith. As a high schooler, my Sunday school class read a book about world religions and compared and contrasted then to Christianity. It was eye opening and totally cool to be able to take any things you didn't like about Christianity and things that were different in others. As an adult, I am so thankful of those youth leaders who were open about their doubt in faith, but willing to still teach us about being kind, having mercy for others, and just trying to find meaning in life without forcing Jesus down peoples throats. \n\nIt doesn't sound like your church is similar, but honestly, i loved real people as youth leaders, it made it so much easier to talk and ask them questions. \n\nI don't know what your specific situation is, maybe stepdad just sees that you might be able to be able to connect to youth. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. Most youth just need a personal connection, not someone teaching straight up stories from the bible. \n\nSounds like NAH in my opinion. \n\nEither way, good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
