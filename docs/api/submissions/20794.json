It would not matter if it\u2019s your wedding or a regular Sunday.  You want to feel 100% seen by your mother.  I get it.  You are not an asshole to want this.  \n\nHowever, your sister can\u2019t help her situation and that\u2019s what people are focusing on.  A lot of the responders may never have lived in a family where one member takes the lion\u2019s share of the focus.  What your asking for is one day to be more about you.  But the problem here is that your mother is not on board.  She wants your sister included and whether she comes or not, your mother will never give you the focus you want and desire. You will always be second.  I\u2019m sorry.  Maybe it is best if neither come or if you have your sister and mother there, just know your mother will ensure your sister\u2019s comfort over your celebration.", "I'll go with NAH.\n\nTo me it seems like you have stepped down and back for a lot of things in order to ensure that your sister got the help and necessary attention she needs for her medical and mental wellbeing. It is tough for family members of disabled persons. And people tend to forget what it's like to be \"the healthy sibling\". You get less care and less support from your parents. Not because they mean unwell but because they are unable to balance it out. I bet if there would be any chance for somebody else to look after your sister while all are attending the wedding it would be no question that you'll invite all of them. But because that is not possible and you want your mom to care for you at least one day in your life like you are the most important person of the day so you decided to not invite your sister.\n\nI also get why your mother is upset about it. I think she would want you both to be equally happy and get along. But she doesn't see that you have been sacrificing before and that's why you snapped in that moment. I guess it's not just about the wedding but about everything before and you had an emotional reaction. I think both sides are equally right and wrong and the best would be to sit down with your mom and talk with her - not about the wedding but about the feeling of being neglected you've had before. How this conversation goes will be key in who could be an AH.\n\n\nEDIT: I have been told that OP stated in another comment that the crash was in 2021. So she did not grow up with less attention or anything like that. Even though that changes the situation, I still go with NAH as I could imagine that 2 years is quite a short period of time to accept such drastic changes and both parties may still have emotional conflicts regarding the situation. I don't see any good solution here. With that new info, talk about the situation and how all of you imagine handling caretaking in the future as this is not a past-regret but a conflict of future-planning.", "Info: how old is your sister and what sort of behaviour are we talking about? Like can your sister sit through a film at the cinema or does her developmental issues mean she has a very short attention span?\n\n\nAlso, has her issues had a big impact on your life -like made you feel like you take a back seat to your sister because of her accident and don't want to feel like second place just for one day?\n\n\nI feel like there's info missing.\n\n\nEdit: I read all OPs comments. YTA", "NTA \n\nI am guessing if your sister can\u2019t set through a movie with out getting up and moving around then she can\u2019t set through a wedding either. I get the ceremony is only 30 minutes tops but honestly wedding can be longer. And sometimes do not start when they are suppose to. Plus waiting on pictures to be taken and other logistics could cause a meltdown for your sister.\n\nYou say your sister throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her way. I have a feeling in this situation there will be a tantrum. She is going to have to set still. Not move when she wants. Not do what she wants plus add the overall stress. This could end badly.\n\nIt\u2019s not selfish to want your parents attention for one day. To be fussed over. To have special moments with your mom and dad. I think every child wants thisZ\n\nI don\u2019t know how long ago your sisters accident was but it sounds like your mom has to focus all her attention in your sister. That you don\u2019t get the one on one time with her like you want. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately your wedding. Your able to invite who you want.\n\nBut I think you have bigger issues then the wedding. For substance you need to ask your parents what their plans for your sister is when they can know longer care for her. My guess it\u2019s you.by not inviting your sister your mom is worried you will not be willing. If your not that\u2019s your choice but you need to make it known now so they can start to search for alternative plans.", "NTA. REALLY. You deserve to have a day not overshadowed by your sister & behavior. Your mother is choosing her. \n\nYes, it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault she has a TBI. No one is saying that. \n\nWould it make mom rest easier if someone stayed with sister?", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules. Mom might not like it, the rules might create drama... but they are still yours to make.", "NTA your wedding day should be about you, and besides, your wedding your rules.", "If her behaviour is going to be incredibly disruptive on the day, then I can see why you would want to avoid that, especially if you\u2019re not hosting babies and toddlers for this very same reason.

You can ask for it, but pushing to make it happen makes you an AH.\n\nIt all contingencies on *how* disruptive Anna\u2019s disability is. But if she can\u2019t sit through a movie, how is she going to sit through an entire wedding ?", "This day is all about you and your partner one day is not much to ask I hope you have a absolutely magnificent day", "\n\nEDIT\n\nI\u2019m editing this response because OP has just disclosed in the comments that her sister\u2019s brain injury is recent. My post was made without that info and I thought implied that this situation had existed for most of their lives, creating a \u201cglass sibling\u201d situation. That\u2019s not the case, so my earlier comments no longer apply. OP, you really should have included that info from the beginning. \n\n It\u2019s okay to want a special day that\u2019s about you \u2014 Reddit hates that concept but brides have customarily been able to enjoy that one day for years. I get her wanting her mom to take a break from hovering over her sister and celebrate with her. But I think there might be a better solution than just excluding her sister entirely. \n\n\u2014-\n\nOut of curiosity, what does your sister have to say about this?", "This is rough but YTA.\n\nYou're excluding your sister from an important day in your life because she can't act \"normally\" due to her TBI.\n\nI understand wanting \"My One Day\" but, real talk OP, is *one day*.\n\nWhen you look back you won't have your mom or your sister in your photos. When asked about it, what will you say \"I invited my mom but not my sister because I didn't want her taking attention away from me since her TBI happened. And then, when my mom confronted me about excluding my sister, I told her not to come too because again, I know she wasn't going to pay any attention to me\".\n\nIs one day out of a calander year really worth the permanent fallout?", "I always thought that weddings were a way to celebrate the union of 2 partners with family and friends, not a self-centered \"perfect\" event. I guess this is why I would never understand posts like that or any whining childless wedding posts of people ready to die on some hills to exclude close family members (yes, disabled people, kids, etc) and damage relationships for the sake of a party. \n\nYour wedding, your rules, but be prepared to suffer the consequences of your choices.\n\nEdit: forgot to vote, YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your own sister not being at your wedding is just sad. \n\nIn that vein are children still invited to your wedding? They\u2019d have the same impact on it as ur sister. Do you serve alcohol?

Wilfully excluding someone who doesn\u2019t fit into your mould of what a \u201cdream wedding\u201d is, is discriminatory and ableist.

You can decide to alienate your sister for something that\u2019s not her fault but you have to deal with the consequences of people seeing you as an asshole.

Maybe I don\u2019t understand all the details here but it seems incredibly self centered to me to cut someone out of your wedding for a disability they cannot control and then the mother as well because she thinks as her SISTER she should be there.

He came to my wedding. Many of my other guests knew in advance about his disability, and everyone there was very accepting and friendly towards him, even though he did say and do some embarrassing things at times (luckily, my friends aren't uptight, and have a sense of humour about such things.)\n\nI know what it's like to be the child who receives more focus from the parents due to a child's disability - unlike OP, that was my whole childhood. However, that is not my brother's fault, and he still deserves to be included in a family celebration.\n\nI am glad that he was there. To exclude him would simply be unthinkable to me. He is my family, and weddings are about family and friends.\n\nOP mentions that her sister has some access and sensory needs which would make it a challenge to participate in the wedding the same way other guests would, to which I would propose making accommodations so she can still be included (I mean, if the venue itself was inherently inaccessible to my sibling, I would pick somewhere else!)\n\nI'm reluctant to outright say \"YTA\" because I feel like there may be more to this family's unique situation and dynamic.

Not AHish to want a good day and some attention from mom but the talk of a \u201cperfect\u201d day and pointing out that the sister had been previously good enough to get into 3 Ivy League schools gives a whiff of problematic priorities for the bride. \n\nYour sister and mother won\u2019t be at your wedding, and for not great reasons. There could have been another way (hiring a caregiver for your sister so your mom could focus, for example) to be inclusive since weddings are family affairs. \n\nThis makes me so sad. I have a cousin with TBI who isn\u2019t even my sister but I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of excluding her from my wedding. She even had a role like my other cousins did. \n\nAlso, trying so hard for a perfect day guarantees it won\u2019t be. Also because there\u2019s no such thing. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the case of a childhood of feeling like the last priority behind a disabled sister (and even then there are ways to be creative about inclusion) and wanting mom\u2019s attention just for one day. You were all adults when this sad accident happened. \n\nIf it\u2019s not too late, maybe you should binge watch The Good Place and think about what it means to be a good person.", "Agree- OP you\u2019re the AH here. \n\nYour wedding day is more than just \u201cone perfect day.\u201d It\u2019s not about \u201cI get my way about everything and I don\u2019t have to compromise.\u201d That\u2019s not real life. Real life is messy and there are consequences to choices you make. \n\nYou can choose to leave your sister out- fine, it\u2019s your choice. However, your consequence is not only losing your mother on an important day, but probably damaging your relationship with both sister and mother (possibly completely and irreversibly.) \n\nAnd that decision also hurts your fianc\u00e9\u2019s relationship with his Mil and Sil. What does HE say in this?? Not one mention of his thoughts or requests on HIS special day\u2026 I find that interesting and honestly speaks volumes about your \u201ccenter stage\u201d attitude that you\u2019re giving off. \n\nYour sister NEEDS her mom. You WANT your mom. That want is absolutely valid. But until you look at this objectively, you will be ruin more than just your perfect day. You\u2019ll be viewed as the AH by every guest that walks into your wedding and realizes your mom and sister were left out. Shit will hit the fan and you will be fighting and then begging for forgiveness eventually when you are left out of Christmas plans. Or family reunions/vacations. \n\nSeriously OP- look objectively at this and look further down the road into your future. Choose what\u2019s best for you, by all means, but don\u2019t be surprised that there will be major consequences. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s hard to be kind, but I think you should still dig deep for empathy and choose kindness. Find a compromise with your mom about specific \u201ctime away from sister\u201d moments for just you two (like getting nails done, or being present for putting on the dress, etc) And talk to her about how important it is that she sticks to these select moments no matter how your sister reacts to this. Ask for a loving Aunt or Cousin to help care/distract sister if you need time with mom. \n\nYou\u2019re not a bad person for wanting time with your mom, but a whole day to have her to yourself isn\u2019t feasible considering your sister\u2019s condition.

They should be fun not serious.", "These are pretty much exactly my thoughts.  I'm an older redditor and have lived long enough to recognize mistakes I made a decade ago.  Your wedding seems like a \\*very\\*big\\*deal but really - it's not.  One day (most normal people) will look back at their pictures and regret not having their sister in them because she is disabled or their mother b/c she was told not to come.  These all seem very significant right at this moment but in the future I think you'll come to realize this isn't the battle you should have taken on.   Also - as someone whose sibling died traumatically - sometimes you really don't realize what you have until it's gone.  I would feel like a super jerk if my brother wasn't at my wedding despite some of the drama that lead up to it.", "I had to call it YTA too. Weddings have turned into this event where we worship the bride rather than see it as a family event/gathering and joining together of two families.

Her attitude is incredibly ableist.", "Maybe this is just a case of ACTUALLY being a glass child (OP is not, she was an adult when her adult sister became disabled and in all likelihood has never even lived under the same roof since it happened) and dealing with parental estrangement/emotional neglect and abuse- but this is just a piss poor reason to kick your family out of your wedding. Your wedding day is about you, but that doesn\u2019t make you more special on your wedding day than you are at any other time. So your sister might cry out during your wedding. Does that really hurt your feelings so bad that you would prefer not to have your sibling present?

She only went that route after the mother got insistent on having the sister there.\n\nA lot of comments in this thread about it only being one day, that OP should endure having the distractive sister on that one day.  OTOH, all OP is looking for is one day where it\u2019s about her.  If the sister was an Ivy student, chess champion, etc. and OP would have asked her to \u201cdress down\u201d even without the TBI then chances are the sister was the golden child, smart and beautiful, so OP felt she was living in her shadow all her life.\n\nI\u2019d have suggested trying to find a way to include the sister in a way that wouldn\u2019t pose a risk of triggering outbursts or otherwise being disruptive.

What a yerk. \n\nI had some brain issues the last 2 years and it was appalling, how many people take distance and stop including you, when you are not 'normal'. I had spasticity/ballistic movements in my legs and was walking a bit like someone from [the ministry of silly walks](https://youtu.be/eCLp7zodUiI) and my 'friends' stopped hanging out with me in public. Embarrassment played a role, but more than that convenience. Transportation, location, spontaneously being able to leave, or change location. Nah, rather exclude and don't even ask if any of their plans could be changed to accommodate me. Nor offered me the chance to find accommodation on myself so I could attend. You know who your people are after stuff like this. \n\nAnd the accident her sister had wasn't that long ago. I guess the sister is still adjusting, and I guess a lot of frustration, pain and desperation about how her whole lived reality, future etc. has inevitably changed forever, plays a big role with her outbursts as well. I'd guess it's not only the TBI and her lessened ability to control emotions, but also a lot boiling underneath. Ofc she's on the edge. There's a whole lot to deal with, and the adjustment takes a couple of years. And now she gets excluded for being too strenuous. Yeah OP is a major AH. I could understand her or feel for her, if her sister got the TBI as a small child and OP grew up in her shadow. But it's just been a short while. I believe her sister would be the first to want to be 'normal', non strenuous, and to not take away attention if she could. Instead she gets tossed aside like a dirty little cinderella that can help with wedding preparations, but isn't invited to the prince's dance in the castle.

This plan is a 100% guarantee the wedding will become focused on mom and sister, just in a different way. If OP goes through with this plan the whole wedding will be a nonstop event of her personally explaining to each guest she greets where the mom and sister are. \n\nMaybe I had a bigger wedding than most, but I spent the whole night literally just greeting guests and making sure everyone was acknowledged.

That\u2019s such an extreme reaction. I think OP needs to reflect on why she\u2019s feeling this way to such an extreme. Look beyond your feelings around your wedding day. I think there\u2019s something there.\n\nNot wanting your sister there because she has a disability is beyond selfish and entirely inconsiderate of your sister. OP even compared her sister to a child in this post! Yes, the classic infantilization and dehumanization of people with disabilities! \n\nI think a solution to this could be that they hire a caretaker for a day to sit with her sister during the wedding so the mom can give OP what she wants, which is more attention. And so her sister doesn\u2019t have to sit alone in a hotel room while the sister\u2019s entire family celebrates OP\u2019s wedding! \n\nBut OP, go see a therapist. You need to unpack your feelings towards your sister. You carry around some terrible perspectives on people with disabilities that are seriously harmful.

I think Instagram culture has a lot to do with it. Everybody wants their wedding to be as flawless as the ones they see pictured. But even those normally have their strains and little problems behind the scenes, it's just cleaned up for the camera. \n\nSo you get brides and grooms (usually brides, but I think that's largely a result of brides being the ones to organize their wedding more in the first place) who want to scrub their wedding clean of everything that makes it less than, literally, picture-perfect. But lives aren't picture-perfect. Families aren't picture-perfect. Both are messy and chaotic and vibrant and wonderful in their own ways, but picture-perfect is not one of those ways. \n\nAnd it's two lives, and two families, which a wedding exists to join. Messiness and all. \n\nThe best wedding gift I received, bar none, was from my husband's stepmother's son. My husband's father had married his wife when both my husband and this man were adults, so they never lived in the same house, and indeed barely knew each other... but the man was a photojournalist. A serious one, who had received awards for the photos which graced the covers of major news magazines. And he offered to take our wedding photos, at no cost, as his gift to us. \n\nWe objected mildly, to make sure he really meant it -- told him that we would love to have him there just as a guest, and didn't like the idea of his having to work during the wedding -- but he was politely insistent and we finally accepted, dizzy at our good fortune. It wasn't just that photographers were expensive, or even that he's a very good photographer, but that this way, we would get ALL the prints, and the negatives -- something almost impossible to buy at any price from typical wedding photographers at that time. (I don't know what it's like now; I haven't had a wedding in seven years.) \n\nBut what we didn't realize was a piece of good fortune even greater than that. Because this photographer didn't shoot the wedding the way a wedding photographer would. There were no staged shots of us standing with our families and our wedding party. Instead, he shot it the way he shot an event in his regular work: he quietly made sure that he gave us a complete record of the occasion, exactly as it happened. Every significant moment was captured, and in the moments that weren't inherently significant per se, just part of the party, he made sure that *every single guest* got into at least one shot. \n\nWhat that meant, in the long run, was that instead of having a wedding that was staged for the photos, or even a small part of the wedding that was staged for the photos and a scattering of \"candids,\" we got the truth of the occasion. Real life in all its messiness, just the way it happened. Our photographs allowed us, not to create a perfect vision of the day, but to *relive* the day -- the one we actually had -- whenever we chose to look at them. \n\nIt's a blessing beyond price. But it couldn't have worked if we were determined to create an image, rather than live an experience, in the first place.", "I've copied and pasted this from OPs comments, I don't think you are responding to the right person?", "I have a TBI and a hypoxic brain injury. 4 months post accident I went to EDC Las Vegas.

I get wanting your mom to focus on you when you get married, but if it's between a distracted mom and *no mom* then what's the point? What would the sister do when she realized she wasn't there for a wedding she was helping make flowers for, since her issues are mainly emotional regulation? Also, could literally no one else help her during the ceremony? And if you have enough guests you aren't going to spend all your time with your mom at reception, why is it not okay to let her be distracted at the reception? It literally would be for the ceremony itself, and based on how OP describes her sister, there was a chance that the distraction level might be minimal. Going to immediately kicking her out without a conversation sat badly with me by itself.\n\nI was on a NAH but had questions cause I couldn't tell if this was just a family struggling with a new obstacle with expectations that needed adjustments, but OP's comments did away with any benefit of the doubt I had. The reason why she didn't talk to her mom about is that she just didn't want the sister there regardless of disability, regardless of mom's attention, regardless of any of the stuff she implies in the post. She doesn't want people being distracted by her hot sister and she doesn't want to deal with anyone paying any level of attention to her.\n\nAnd honestly the more I think about her sister having emotional control issues the worse I feel for her realizing she isn't going to her sister's wedding.

You're being an ableist to your own sister, who is a human person, more important than a simple party. And a wedding is just that - a party. She's capable of understanding that you consider her a burden and don't want to share special moments with her. Comparing her to a child because of behaviors she can't control, after everything she's lost, shows you don't respect how she's forever changed in ways that can't be undone. I hope your family goes nc with you, as you value material things and appearances far too much to be anything more than a guilt/shame noose you intentionally fasten around your sister's neck. Children think alternatively abled bodies \"demand attention away from them with their pesky needs.\" You're not a child. You know better than to think her basic care will be \"distracting your mom from doting on just you on your big day.\" If she's capable of being in a hotel room by herself without her mother constantly on top of her, she can come to your wedding, and you still get the attention you so desperately crave. You simply do not want your family to get distracted from paying attention to your majesty, for even a second, to care about your struggling sister. You're acting very childish, maybe you should be uninvited from your wedding instead? \n\nWestern weddings are a show of solipsism and self-centeredness, when they're supposed to be a celebration of two families becoming one. Can't really be that celebration if it's \"all about you,\" and you're throwing family members out left and right because they \"don't fit your dream.\" It's likely why the divorce rate is so high - so many start their marriage with an obsessive drive to be the only one paid attention to and a relentless want to get their own way. This willingness and understanding regarding the sacrifice of lifelong relationships, so four hours of a person's life turns out photo-perfect, baffles me. It feels like cultural scar tissue. It's funny that you think a party only you will have fun at is worth sacrificing your sister's relationship and your mother's respect. Funny \"you don't deserve them\" not funny \"haha.\" \n\nIt's okay that you've dreamed about this since you were a child, but you have to know there's no such thing as a perfect wedding. And that you're supposed to make new dreams when circumstances change. Your sister did. Your mother did. Why didn't you? \n\nAs a member of the \"My Sister is a Corpse\" Club, I would have done anything to have had her at my wedding. I wouldn't have acted like she embarrasses me and takes away all my mommy's love and time. I recognized she had care needs that I don't and required more from my mother than I do. And I helped care for her because I love her. Because her love was special. Because she was special.\n\nYour sister won't ruin the wedding. Your wedding will be ruined by one of two things: the universe and your karmatic ramifications or the rumor mill. Karma would have your mother in law wearing a wedding dress, it raining and the roof leaking, and the maid of honor getting too drunk and telling the story you begged her not to. The rumor mill is inevitable when you've uninvited your sister and your mother from your wedding because sis has a traumatic brain injury. \"Those centerpieces are nice, I guess. Did you hear about the Anna situation?\" \"Did you get the chicken or fish? Either way, it's disgusting - just like the Anna situation.\" You wanted to be the center of attention \"for just this one day.\"Well, you're not going to be when you've dramatically excluded pivotal family members for selfish reasons. It's gonna be the only thing anyone on your side talks about. If you're looking to bridge the gap between your family and your in-laws, this is a great way to do that because they're going to be spending the majority of the reception time gossiping about why your mom isn't there and \"I thought she had a sister.\" Did you not consider the human presence at your wedding? And that people, when grouped, talk shit like it's their favorite hobby? My father, a wedding planner for the last 35 years, can confirm this is not the way to keep all eyes on you. It is the easiest way to make sure you're not even a blip of the conversation at your own wedding. \n\nI hope, by your second wedding, you've gotten to a place where you value show a little less and your people a little more.\n\nMostly, though, I hope your sister finds peace with the grief of losing a sibling like this. \n\nAt least *she* still has her mother. \ud83d\udc40", "Easiest YTA ever this sounds like an incredibly selfish and jealous person.

From your comments, it seems you don't want your sister there not because of the TBI but because you feel she is prettier than you and you won't be the center of attention as the bride.  That makes you the AH and a bad sister.   \nAnd even if your sister has some emotional control issues due to her TBI, I am sure that your mother assisting and checking on her will not take away from your special day. \n\nReally, part of what makes a wedding a special day is the family and friends who attend, and you want to cut out your sister who you claim you love.
