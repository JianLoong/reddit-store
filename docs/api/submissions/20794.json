It would not matter if it\u2019s your wedding or a regular Sunday.  You want to feel 100% seen by your mother.  I get it.  You are not an asshole to want this.  \n\nHowever, your sister can\u2019t help her situation and that\u2019s what people are focusing on.  A lot of the responders may never have lived in a family where one member takes the lion\u2019s share of the focus.  What your asking for is one day to be more about you.  But the problem here is that your mother is not on board.  She wants your sister included and whether she comes or not, your mother will never give you the focus you want and desire. You will always be second.  I\u2019m sorry.  Maybe it is best if neither come or if you have your sister and mother there, just know your mother will ensure your sister\u2019s comfort over your celebration.", "I'll go with NAH.\n\nTo me it seems like you have stepped down and back for a lot of things in order to ensure that your sister got the help and necessary attention she needs for her medical and mental wellbeing. It is tough for family members of disabled persons. And people tend to forget what it's like to be \"the healthy sibling\". You get less care and less support from your parents. Not because they mean unwell but because they are unable to balance it out. I bet if there would be any chance for somebody else to look after your sister while all are attending the wedding it would be no question that you'll invite all of them. But because that is not possible and you want your mom to care for you at least one day in your life like you are the most important person of the day so you decided to not invite your sister.\n\nI also get why your mother is upset about it. I think she would want you both to be equally happy and get along. But she doesn't see that you have been sacrificing before and that's why you snapped in that moment. I guess it's not just about the wedding but about everything before and you had an emotional reaction. I think both sides are equally right and wrong and the best would be to sit down with your mom and talk with her - not about the wedding but about the feeling of being neglected you've had before. How this conversation goes will be key in who could be an AH.", "Info: how old is your sister and what sort of behaviour are we talking about? Like can your sister sit through a film at the cinema or does her developmental issues mean she has a very short attention span?\n\n\nAlso, has her issues had a big impact on your life -like made you feel like you take a back seat to your sister because of her accident and don't want to feel like second place just for one day?\n\n\nI feel like there's info missing.", "NTA \n\nI am guessing if your sister can\u2019t set through a movie with out getting up and moving around then she can\u2019t set through a wedding either. I get the ceremony is only 30 minutes tops but honestly wedding can be longer. And sometimes do not start when they are suppose to. Plus waiting on pictures to be taken and other logistics could cause a meltdown for your sister.\n\nYou say your sister throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her way. I have a feeling in this situation there will be a tantrum. She is going to have to set still. Not move when she wants. Not do what she wants plus add the overall stress. This could end badly.\n\nIt\u2019s not selfish to want your parents attention for one day. To be fussed over. To have special moments with your mom and dad. I think every child wants thisZ\n\nI don\u2019t know how long ago your sisters accident was but it sounds like your mom has to focus all her attention in your sister. That you don\u2019t get the one on one time with her like you want. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately your wedding. Your able to invite who you want.\n\nBut I think you have bigger issues then the wedding. For substance you need to ask your parents what their plans for your sister is when they can know longer care for her. My guess it\u2019s you.by not inviting your sister your mom is worried you will not be willing. If your not that\u2019s your choice but you need to make it known now so they can start to search for alternative plans.", "NTA. REALLY. You deserve to have a day not overshadowed by your sister & behavior. Your mother is choosing her. \n\nYes, it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault she has a TBI.

You can ask for it, but pushing to make it happen makes you an AH.\n\nIt all contingencies on *how* disruptive Anna\u2019s disability is.

We\u2019ve seen countless posts here on Reddit where people talk about what it\u2019s like growing up in the shadow of a special needs sibling, and we\u2019re usually a lot more sympathetic than some here are being. OP has spent much of her life taking a backseat to her sister, and of course understandably so. But she deserves to live her life and maybe have a few things in it where her sister\u2019s needs don\u2019t come first. \n\nWhat happened to your sister was tragic. But it wasn\u2019t your fault, and it didn\u2019t happen to you.

I kind of get the idea behind not inviting your sister to the wedding, but you're basically saying that her disability is a huge hindrance to a good time.

You mother hovering over her hardly affects YOUR ceremony? Like what does she do that could detract from the proceedings? It seems to me that you just want to hide your sister to protect the pristine-ness of your picture perfect wedding. The fact that you literally asked your mom to lock her up is just nasty. Your own sister not being at your wedding is just sad. \n\nIn that vein are children still invited to your wedding? They\u2019d have the same impact on it as ur sister. Do you serve alcohol? Maybe some guest could get drunk and create a ruckus.

Wilfully excluding someone who doesn\u2019t fit into your mould of what a \u201cdream wedding\u201d is, is discriminatory and ableist. Doing that to your sister who went through a traumatic accident is even more egregious. A wedding day doesn\u2019t give u the licence to make someone feel excluded and marginalised this way. \n\nThere\u2019s still time.

She does have trouble sitting still sometimes and can start crying when things aren't how she wants them (for example, she likes her food cut a certain way). She does like movies but can't sit through a movie at the theater without taking her outside for a walk around a couple of times, she doesn't like the environment (dark and kind of enclosed). Because she doesn't get some social cues, when she talks to people she can come off rude.\n\nAnd yes that's exactly it, I'm aware that no one's wedding day goes \"completely perfect\" but I just want my big day to be about me", "This! NTA OP", "Yeah I'm in no way blaming her, none of this is her fault. But it is what it is. Even if someone else stays with her mom will still want to check, I mean she can stay alone but people will still come up to talk to her. There will also be a lot of people she doesn't know at the wedding from my fiance's side", "Yes damn, since when are weddings all about being perfect instead of being with friends and family. If people would care less, it would be some much more fun", "yes, a community coming together to support a major life change in one community member's life.   \n\n\nnot a celebrity event where one member of the community is suddenly some sort of, I don't know, princess or goddess to be adored from afar.", "Agree. I would be leaning towards inclusion rather than exclusion. But hey, you get to choose for yourself. Just - your idea of the \"perfect day\" - really would not be mine. I'd want them all there.", "Are you serious???!  There are so many occasions where you most definitely are TA for putting distance between yourself and blood relatives! This could be one where you're NTA - but even then it's only temporary distance!!", "do you think child free weddings are for assholes too?", "It feels like you are suggesting that OP can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t want this one day, her wedding day, to be a day where her MOTHER pays attention to her without her high-needs sister there to potentially distract her mom. Is that what you\u2019re suggesting? That because her soon-to-be husband will be paying attention to her, why would she possibly want her mom to pay attention to her too?", "Because the sister is interrupting the ceremony and is a distraction. How are you so dense?", "Imagine how she felt when she realised she raised a spoiled brat who values her fantasy about a celebration over her mom and sister. And doubles down by uninviting her simply because she tried to be a decent human being and asked for her sister to be part of the event under her supervision. Fuck me sideways with a rolled copy of the Reader's Digest; I saw people receive better treatment in a retirement home.", "EXACTLY.", "I answered pretty much all those questions in my post. My mom will be hovering over Anna the entire time, I just want one day where her attention is on me for a bit.

Wilful ableism is never especially if it\u2019s done to protect the pristine-ness of a few pictures like. Wedding or not, that makes u an asshole. Sorry.", "kids aren't racists or bigots either but they're still excluded from a child free wedding...", "It\u2019s incredibly naive to think someone with TBI will suddenly, miraculously become mature and understanding for a special day. That would be like a toddler suddenly becoming mature for a special occasion. The sister doesn\u2019t have the capacity, special day or not.", "I think she just want her moms attention for one day. Yes her sister can\u2019t help but to be disruptive and need assistance but it\u2019s ok for op to want to feel special for one day.

I'd LOVE  to be fully able-bodied too, but this whole bs of \"I have life harder than you, so therefore, what you experience and how you feel doesn't matter\" is so toxic! \n\nOP is still human. She still has feelings, and she's allowed to have her own feelings!

So while I don\u2019t think she is wrong for asking for attention, it seems really petty considering that the while OP wants it (but didn\u2019t try to ask for it specifically) while her sister NEEDS it. I\u2019m all in support for OP to ask her mom to be more present and perhaps suggest getting a companion or medical professional to keep her sister occupied. \n\nStraight up excluding her to get attention from her mom is a bit..weird.", "How? \n\nAnd that\u2019s my central problem. \n\nNone of the things OP describes are unique to her sister. Like she says, any moody teenager can cause the same distraction so why specifically ban her sister but allow a bunch of 14 year olds to run around?\n\nIf the stakes her higher I\u2019d get it but being rude to people who communicate with you is hardly a distraction to the wedding?", ">My mom will be hovering over Anna the entire time, I just want one day where her attention is on me for a bit.\n\nUninviting her from the wedding helps that how exactly?", "So kids over 13 are allowed? And you said your sister acts like a moody teenager when teenagers are allowed at your wedding? \n\nLike I don\u2019t see what\u2019s not clicking? Kids over 13 can very much cause the same amount of ruckus you must not be very familiar with teenagers. They\u2019re rude to people and can throw tantrums. Your sister will not be doing anything different. \n\nBut finally,\n\nYou want your mom to hover over you instead  of your sister who needs it more and if provided that CAN attend your wedding. you want your mom\u2019s attention SO BADLY that you\u2019re willing to cage your TBI affected sister and exclude her from the proceedings just so your mom can fawn over you in a ceremony that\u2019s all about you anyway. So it\u2019s not about your sister causing a ruckus you just want all the attention from your mom? That\u2019s just weird.

And for this very reason, she gets uninvited from her other daughter's wedding, who, BTW, seems adamant in sticking to her idea of a perfect wedding, disregarding the effect her decision has on her family relationship.

From what I can glean from her comments it's more about her desire for her mum's attention, something she's not had since her sister's accident. Her 'perfect day' involves her mum's attention being on her, not her sister. Again, from what I understand from the comments her sister finds it hard to sit still for long, so first thing I'd want to know if there's anyone else who can care for/monitor her sister during the ceremony and take her out if needed, so mum can focus on her other child, or is mum unlikely to accept that as a compromise?", "Just it be clear, you think that not inviting her sister but inviting her mom doesn\u2019t communicate to her mother that she wants her mother to be involved in her wedding? What exactly do you think it communicates?", "I think this is your one day to be selfish. Your wedding should be about you.\n\nAnd your probably right mom is single. Which just proves my point that op hasn\u2019t been a priority in a while. It\u2019s ok if she wants to be the priority.\n\n\nEdit at add: I also think that op has bigger issues then just the wedding. Like i said in another post I think mom looked at op to be the next caregiver for sister. If op wants to great but she should not be forced too. I think mom realizes op may not want to and wants to live her own life. I think moms more upset now knowing op may not  welling to be a caregiver after she get to old to care for sister."]}
