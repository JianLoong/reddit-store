It would not matter if it\u2019s your wedding or a regular Sunday.  You want to feel 100% seen by your mother.  I get it.  You are not an asshole to want this.  \n\nHowever, your sister can\u2019t help her situation and that\u2019s what people are focusing on.  A lot of the responders may never have lived in a family where one member takes the lion\u2019s share of the focus.  What your asking for is one day to be more about you.  But the problem here is that your mother is not on board.  She wants your sister included and whether she comes or not, your mother will never give you the focus you want and desire. You will always be second.  I\u2019m sorry.  Maybe it is best if neither come or if you have your sister and mother there, just know your mother will ensure your sister\u2019s comfort over your celebration.", "I'll go with NAH.\n\nTo me it seems like you have stepped down and back for a lot of things in order to ensure that your sister got the help and necessary attention she needs for her medical and mental wellbeing. It is tough for family members of disabled persons. And people tend to forget what it's like to be \"the healthy sibling\". You get less care and less support from your parents. Not because they mean unwell but because they are unable to balance it out. I bet if there would be any chance for somebody else to look after your sister while all are attending the wedding it would be no question that you'll invite all of them. But because that is not possible and you want your mom to care for you at least one day in your life like you are the most important person of the day so you decided to not invite your sister.\n\nI also get why your mother is upset about it. I think she would want you both to be equally happy and get along. But she doesn't see that you have been sacrificing before and that's why you snapped in that moment. I guess it's not just about the wedding but about everything before and you had an emotional reaction. I think both sides are equally right and wrong and the best would be to sit down with your mom and talk with her - not about the wedding but about the feeling of being neglected you've had before. How this conversation goes will be key in who could be an AH.\n\n\nEDIT: I have been told that OP stated in another comment that the crash was in 2021. So she did not grow up with less attention or anything like that. Even though that changes the situation, I still go with NAH as I could imagine that 2 years is quite a short period of time to accept such drastic changes and both parties may still have emotional conflicts regarding the situation. I don't see any good solution here. With that new info, talk about the situation and how all of you imagine handling caretaking in the future as this is not a past-regret but a conflict of future-planning.", "Info: how old is your sister and what sort of behaviour are we talking about? Like can your sister sit through a film at the cinema or does her developmental issues mean she has a very short attention span?\n\n\nAlso, has her issues had a big impact on your life -like made you feel like you take a back seat to your sister because of her accident and don't want to feel like second place just for one day?\n\n\nI feel like there's info missing.", "NTA \n\nI am guessing if your sister can\u2019t set through a movie with out getting up and moving around then she can\u2019t set through a wedding either. I get the ceremony is only 30 minutes tops but honestly wedding can be longer. And sometimes do not start when they are suppose to. Plus waiting on pictures to be taken and other logistics could cause a meltdown for your sister.\n\nYou say your sister throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her way. I have a feeling in this situation there will be a tantrum. She is going to have to set still. Not move when she wants. Not do what she wants plus add the overall stress. This could end badly.\n\nIt\u2019s not selfish to want your parents attention for one day. To be fussed over. To have special moments with your mom and dad. I think every child wants thisZ\n\nI don\u2019t know how long ago your sisters accident was but it sounds like your mom has to focus all her attention in your sister. That you don\u2019t get the one on one time with her like you want. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately your wedding. Your able to invite who you want.\n\nBut I think you have bigger issues then the wedding. For substance you need to ask your parents what their plans for your sister is when they can know longer care for her. My guess it\u2019s you.by not inviting your sister your mom is worried you will not be willing. If your not that\u2019s your choice but you need to make it known now so they can start to search for alternative plans.", "NTA. REALLY. You deserve to have a day not overshadowed by your sister & behavior. Your mother is choosing her. \n\nYes, it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault she has a TBI. No one is saying that. \n\nWould it make mom rest easier if someone stayed with sister?", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules. Mom might not like it, the rules might create drama... but they are still yours to make.", "NTA your wedding day should be about you, and besides, your wedding your rules.", "If her behaviour is going to be incredibly disruptive on the day, then I can see why you would want to avoid that, especially if you\u2019re not hosting babies and toddlers for this very same reason. NTA. \n\nHowever, you can\u2019t expect your mom to drop one of her daughters to please the other, either. You can ask for it, but pushing to make it happen makes you an AH.\n\nIt all contingencies on *how* disruptive Anna\u2019s disability is. But if she can\u2019t sit through a movie, how is she going to sit through an entire wedding ?", "This day is all about you and your partner one day is not much to ask I hope you have a absolutely magnificent day", "\n\nEDIT\n\nI\u2019m editing this response because OP has just disclosed in the comments that her sister\u2019s brain innury is recent. My post was made without that info and I thought implied that this situation had existed for most of their lives, creating a \u201cglass sibling\u201d situation. That\u2019s not the case, so my earlier comments no longer apply. OP, you really should have included that info from the beginning. \n\n It\u2019s okay to want a special day that\u2019s about you \u2014 Reddit hates that concept but brides have customarily been able to enjoy that one day for years. I get her wanting her mom to take a break from hovering over her sister and celebrate with her. But I think there might be a better solution than just excluding her sister entirely. \n\n\u2014-\n\nOut of curiosity, what does your sister have to say about this?", "This is rough but YTA.\n\nYou're excluding your sister from an important day in your life because she can't act \"normally\" due to her TBI.\n\nI understand wanting \"My One Day\" but, real talk OP, is *one day*.\n\nWhen you look back you won't have your mom or your sister in your photos. When asked about it, what will you say \"I invited my mom but not my sister because I didn't want her taking attention away from me since her TBI happened. And then, when my mom confronted me about excluding my sister, I told her not to come too because again, I know she wasn't going to pay any attention to me\".\n\nIs one day out of a calander year really worth the permanent fallout?", "I always thought that weddings were a way to celebrate the union of 2 partners with family and friends, not a self-centered \"perfect\" event. I guess this is why I would never understand posts like that or any whining childless wedding posts of people ready to die on some hills to exclude close family members (yes, disabled people, kids, etc) and damage relationships for the sake of a party. \n\nYour wedding, your rules, but be prepared to suffer the consequences of your choices.\n\nEdit: forgot to vote, YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You mother hovering over her hardly affects YOUR ceremony? Like what does she do that could detract from the proceedings?

Your own sister not being at your wedding is just sad. \n\nIn that vein are children still invited to your wedding? They\u2019d have the same impact on it as ur sister. Do you serve alcohol?

Wilfully excluding someone who doesn\u2019t fit into your mould of what a \u201cdream wedding\u201d is, is discriminatory and ableist.

Many of my other guests knew in advance about his disability, and everyone there was very accepting and friendly towards him, even though he did say and do some embarrassing things at times (luckily, my friends aren't uptight, and have a sense of humour about such things.)\n\nI know what it's like to be the child who receives more focus from the parents due to a child's disability - unlike OP, that was my whole childhood. However, that is not my brother's fault, and he still deserves to be included in a family celebration.\n\nI am glad that he was there. To exclude him would simply be unthinkable to me. He is my family, and weddings are about family and friends.\n\nOP mentions that her sister has some access and sensory needs which would make it a challenge to participate in the wedding the same way other guests would, to which I would propose making accommodations so she can still be included (I mean, if the venue itself was inherently inaccessible to my sibling, I would pick somewhere else!)\n\nI'm reluctant to outright say \"YTA\" because I feel like there may be more to this family's unique situation and dynamic.

Not AHish to want a good day and some attention from mom but the talk of a \u201cperfect\u201d day and pointing out that the sister had been previously good enough to get into 3 Ivy League schools gives a whiff of problematic priorities for the bride. \n\nYour sister and mother won\u2019t be at your wedding, and for not great reasons. There could have been another way (hiring a caregiver for your sister so your mom could focus, for example) to be inclusive since weddings are family affairs. \n\nThis makes me so sad. I have a cousin with TBI who isn\u2019t even my sister but I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of excluding her from my wedding. She even had a role like my other cousins did. \n\nAlso, trying so hard for a perfect day guarantees it won\u2019t be. Also because there\u2019s no such thing. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the case of a childhood of feeling like the last priority behind a disabled sister (and even then there are ways to be creative about inclusion) and wanting mom\u2019s attention just for one day. You were all adults when this sad accident happened. \n\nIf it\u2019s not too late, maybe you should binge watch The Good Place and think about what it means to be a good person.", "Agree- OP you\u2019re the AH here. \n\nYour wedding day is more than just \u201cone perfect day.\u201d It\u2019s not about \u201cI get my way about everything and I don\u2019t have to compromise.\u201d That\u2019s not real life. Real life is messy and there are consequences to choices you make. \n\nYou can choose to leave your sister out- fine, it\u2019s your choice. However, your consequence is not only losing your mother on an important day, but probably damaging your relationship with both sister and mother (possibly completely and irreversibly.) \n\nAnd that decision also hurts your fianc\u00e9\u2019s relationship with his Mil and Sil. What does HE say in this?? Not one mention of his thoughts or requests on HIS special day\u2026 I find that interesting and honestly speaks volumes about your \u201ccenter stage\u201d attitude that you\u2019re giving off. \n\nYour sister NEEDS her mom. You WANT your mom. That want is absolutely valid. But until you look at this objectively, you will be ruin more than just your perfect day. You\u2019ll be viewed as the AH by every guest that walks into your wedding and realizes your mom and sister were left out. Shit will hit the fan and you will be fighting and then begging for forgiveness eventually when you are left out of Christmas plans.

Choose what\u2019s best for you, by all means, but don\u2019t be surprised that there will be major consequences. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s hard to be kind, but I think you should still dig deep for empathy and choose kindness. Find a compromise with your mom about specific \u201ctime away from sister\u201d moments for just you two (like getting nails done, or being present for putting on the dress, etc) And talk to her about how important it is that she sticks to these select moments no matter how your sister reacts to this. Ask for a loving Aunt or Cousin to help care/distract sister if you need time with mom. \n\nYou\u2019re not a bad person for wanting time with your mom, but a whole day to have her to yourself isn\u2019t feasible considering your sister\u2019s condition.

They should be fun not serious.", "These are pretty much exactly my thoughts.  I'm an older redditor and have lived long enough to recognize mistakes I made a decade ago.  Your wedding seems like a \\*very\\*big\\*deal but really - it's not.  One day (most normal people) will look back at their pictures and regret not having their sister in them because she is disabled or their mother b/c she was told not to come.  These all seem very significant right at this moment but in the future I think you'll come to realize this isn't the battle you should have taken on.   Also - as someone whose sibling died traumatically - sometimes you really don't realize what you have until it's gone.  I would feel like a super jerk if my brother wasn't at my wedding despite some of the drama that lead up to it.", "I had to call it YTA too. Weddings have turned into this event where we worship the bride rather than see it as a family event/gathering and joining together of two families.

It's no show there increasingly popular as narcissism consumes our society.", "I cant imagine, if the sister can comprehend the situation, to know that her sibling doesn't want her at her wedding because of an issue she has no control over. That sounds fucking terrible and I honestly feel for the sister in this situation.   \n\n\nOP uninvites her mom to the wedding because her mom understandably doesn't like that OP doesn't want her sister at the wedding.

Its one day.", "This! I\u2019m so surprised at all the NTA. Her attitude is incredibly ableist.", "Maybe this is just a case of ACTUALLY being a glass child (OP is not, she was an adult when her adult sister became disabled and in all likelihood has never even lived under the same roof since it happened) and dealing with parental estrangement/emotional neglect and abuse- but this is just a piss poor reason to kick your family out of your wedding. Your wedding day is about you, but that doesn\u2019t make you more special on your wedding day than you are at any other time. So your sister might cry out during your wedding. Does that really hurt your feelings so bad that you would prefer not to have your sibling present?

Sister with a TBI is a tough situation, but \u201cI don\u2019t want her around because she might embarrass me or might need Mom to focus on her, I want her hidden away during my wedding\u201d is just a sad framing of the situation.", "Yeah I\u2019m shocked that OP didn\u2019t try other options such as hiring an aide or talking to her mom before just fully uninviting her sister.", "Oh  and OP said in another comment that she is enlisting her sister to make flower papers for the decoration.

And what kinds they are NOT likely to have.  \n\nOn the other hand, using the wedding as an opportunity to venerate the bride is not very healthy.  Who is she?

OTOH, all OP is looking for is one day where it\u2019s about her.  If the sister was an Ivy student, chess champion, etc. and OP would have asked her to \u201cdress down\u201d even without the TBI then chances are the sister was the golden child, smart and beautiful, so OP felt she was living in her shadow all her life.\n\nI\u2019d have suggested trying to find a way to include the sister in a way that wouldn\u2019t pose a risk of triggering outbursts or otherwise being disruptive.  Perhaps OP has looked into this and hasn\u2019t found a way so uninviting the sister was all she could think of.", "Because the hope is that the mother will cave to be there at her daughters wedding. \n\nAnd you probably don't want to deal with constant pushing to bring the sister from someone that isn't going to show up anyway if you don't agree.", "Un inviting mom wasn\u2019t a great choice\u2026 fair point. But it seems like she reacted emotionally to an emotionally charged situation. She doesn\u2019t need therapy to feel like her mom isn\u2019t prioritizing her on what should be a special, once in a lifetime occasion. It\u2019s sad that she felt like she had to react harshly. I\u2019m don\u2019t want to put words in her mouth, but I\u2019m sure she feels neglected. And I don\u2019t think she lashed out at sister \u2026.. \n\nMaybe they could arrange a caregiver to sit with sister and remove her from the facility if she acts out\u2026.

There was a post here where someone uninvited their bridesmaid for sharing she had fetal alcohol syndrome and most votes were NTA.", "No way!!! I must've missed that one. So get sister involved in planning and prep but cut her from the ceremony. I thought OP was TA, not I think OP is BIG TA. How does it keep getting worse?", "Jesus", "I hate that we treat weddings like an achievement and not a transition.  \n\n\nMy husband and I made a promise to each other and our lifestyle changed accordingly, it's not the same as when I finished school and achieved a degree.  \n\n\n It's not even as big a transition as it used to be, as we are now usually adults with our own homes when we make the transition, and it used to mark the tranistion into independence and adulthood.", "And from OP's own words, her sister seems to be handling things pretty well, considering I saw in comments the accident was only 2 years ago.  OP compares her to a \"moody teenager\" - and then admits that teenagers would be present at the wedding, so to me it seems she's specifically targeting her sister.", "I know, some of the ableism in posts/comments like that genuinely upsets me. I\u2019m on the spectrum and to me this just feels like this proves that people see people like us as \u2018burdens\u2019 or a nuisance to be swept under the rug and ignored.", "YES!! This is literally so sick!!! Everybody here saying N T A are completely ableist and would rather disabled people be not seen and not heard even if they are a part of their family. I can't even imagine being this self-centered and individualist to exclude somebody I love from an important event because \"not all the attention will be on me and it won't be perfect!\" If disabled people aren't accommodated in your idea of perfect, you are TA!!!!!", "OP is embarrassed by her sister. Heaven forbid OP ever get an injury. Wonder if her hubby will stay with her since she thinks it\u2019s okay to abandon the handicapped?", "Weddings are loud and busy and can get disorientingly overwhelming if you're so predisposed. From what OP has described, there's a definite possibility that her sister would react somewhat loudly to being overwhelmed, and having all sorts of random people come talk to her as the sister-of-the-bride instead of just being a passive participant means it's a lot harder to manage her emotional state.", "That the thing, she said her sister SOMETIMES acts like a moody teenager. Ok so will a 16 year old who is welcome at the wedding...", "I have to agree. Could you really enjoy a \"perfect\" wedding if it excludes your mother and sister?

She can't control every impression anyone has of any other guest.", "So your wedding isn\u2019t dark and closed in. She can easily make sure her food is cut correctly. If she\u2019s a little rude, who cares? she\u2019s not making a speech. This all seems so strange to me. Are you going to be okay looking back on your photos and saying to your kids that you decided it was better to make sure no one said a rude comment than have your mom there? I won\u2019t say that you\u2019re an asshole but you do seem shortsighted and selfish", "Yes because your excluding your sister from your wedding because she\u2019s disabled can you not see how that would upset your mum? This should be a time that brings you all together instead your using it to sow Davison in your family instead!", "I reckon you\u2019re right. I think OP is ashamed of her sister", "I don\u2019t understand this undivided attention thing. What exactly does OP want her mum to do? Won\u2019t she be a bit busy, I don\u2019t know, walking down the aisle, saying vows, engaging with all the other people at the wedding, dancing with her husband?", "Oh wow, you are right.  Op's sister is stunning and fiance used to date her until the accident.  I'd be curious what the fiance's motives are in this relationship.", "Your missing the fact that this person has tbi as well and the problem is the overstimulation which causes pain and can then subsequently cause the acting out that the main op has mentioned the above commentator isn\u2019t shamed they just understand their own disability and doesn\u2019t want to potentially have a risk of overstimulation which is something that can be quite painful it\u2019s not shameful you should take what they\u2019re saying at face value and maybe understand that", ">But ultimately, if that perception from others even exists, it's THEIR problem.\n\nI don't like this argument. Yes, the way others perceive you is not your responsibility and you can't control that, but it definitely IS your problem when it affects the way you feel. If someone gives you nasty looks, treats you badly or does whatever else that shows how negatively they perceive you, you can see it. And when you see it, you can't just turn your feelings off and not feel hurt by it.", "Brides like OP are obnoxious. even without this sister issue. anyone who is that obsessed with being the prettiest person in the room or thinks someone\u2019s tattoo ruins the wedding photo or whatever are completely illogical.", "So much of it is in the comments though.

It changes things.", "My immediate impulse was NTA because I thought her sister had been severely mentally disabled for a long period of time and she just wanted one day where she wouldn\u2019t be focusing on that and her mom could focus on her, which I get. Everyone who has a good relationship with their parents wants them to focus on them for their wedding day. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t seem that severe, it didn\u2019t happen that long ago, and the whole part about the sister making decorations makes me think NAH / slight YTA", "I was thinking the same thing! I thought it was an obvious YTA. \n\nWhat is she going to say when people ask why her mom and her recently disabled sister aren\u2019t at her wedding? \u201cWell, I was afraid my perfect special day wouldn\u2019t be completely perfect and some attention might be taken off of me for a moment or two during the course of the day\u201d?", "Its already past 3k now in 5 mins, dang. People love to go with the crowd for one thing(hive mind) and another is yes, reddit is full of shallow poeple.", "It's also because of Reddit's biases (or specifically AITAs).

She's acting like her mum would be the only guest.", "I think it's a product of all the self glorification that happens nowadays. It's more than being shallow. It's pride in a biblical sense. If OP was getting married in a church, I imagine the preacher would have counseled her into making the right decision or not allowed her to get married in the church.", "Reading through some of the comments, it almost looks like OP has actually been jealous of her sister for getting so much attention since her accident, if not prior to that.", "New here ?", "I agree, a wedding is a ceremony to celebrate joining two lives together and the entire point of having a celebration isnt to highlight how perfect the bride/groom are its to bring their lives together and bring people together from both sides that love the groom and bride and share the moment. I would be crushed if i was OPs sister, having already experienced a tragic accident and losing my chance at a normal life, being shunned by my sister would be the icing on the shit cake.

I\u2019ve got another sibling with special needs and we all rally around him. I guess it all just depends on dynamics and the what the pattern has been.

Equally we can say OP sends a horrible message for wanting to keep her sister away from the wedding alone on the same day. \nReally it sounds like they need to have some family therapy and find a compromise.", "No it doesn't. It means the OP is selfish because she doesn't want anyone at the wedding that might get more attention than her. That is completely horrible. What type of person do you have to be to say \"I don't want my sister to attend my wedding because she will take attention from me because of her disabilities\". If I was the mom, I'd uninvite myself as well. Now the OP gets no attention. Even if I was just a friend and invited to the wedding, I'd also uninvite myself and go spend the day with the mother and sister instead. That's just down right cold.", "I just can't see it that way. Quite contrary, by accepting that OP can exclude the sister when her disability is a burden would be unequal treatment in my eyes.", "So if one of my kids treats the other one unfairly, I have to go along with it? Oof, I've not been a good parent so far...", "If someone in my family or circle of friends did what OP is trying to do to her sister, it would irrevocably change my relationship with that person, and not for the better.", "Right?

She\u2019s capable of being left alone so obviously she doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity of a toddler. She\u2019s a grown woman with a TBI. There are plenty of people with TBI\u2019s who are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves and some that aren\u2019t. OP describes her basically as like a 14-16 year old.\n\nHell I suffered a TBI. Yeah I have lowered inhibition compared to how I was and I have some short term memory problems and brutal headaches as well as some other symptoms. Since having it I end up saying a lot of things that are more offensive than I intend them to be because my brain doesn\u2019t always compute how it\u2019s going to be taken. I also own a house, live on my own, take care of my daughter, and I\u2019m successful in my career.\n\nI\u2019m not unaware or incapable of understanding what\u2019s happening around me or unable to control myself the way you\u2019re describing, and it doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s sister is that way either.", "lol ya'll are wild", "My point is \n\nGetting attention from mom and having sister at wedding are not mutually exclusive. It\u2019s her mom\u2019s responsibility to provide attention. \n\nIf OP had suggested alternative set ups or communicated with her mom to take it upon herself to be more involved I\u2019d be with them 100%. \n\nI don\u2019t like how quick she was to just cut her sister off. You can have your mom and your sister at a wedding. You need to just put in some accommodations in place.", "Let's be real, the sister's appearance has probably changed and this is the real issue.

I am also disabled in a way that affects me similarly and understand full well the calculations we have to make. I am simply saying that how one appears visually to others should not be part of that equation.", "There are a bunch of ways to accommodate disabled guests that will ensure their comfort and inclusion.

Have had it for just under three years now.\n\nIn the beginning, I would also have avoided weddings but I'm learning to live with this new normal and I want to continue to be included in things. I may take a little longer to recover but weddings are a big deal. I want to live just like anybody else.\n\nIt's not fair to assume that the sister will hate the wedding, or be in pain. Of course TBIs vary from person to person but if we're going purely from the sister's POV, the only way to know is to ask.", "Even if the TBI wasn't recent, it's still shallow to exclude her sister. Maybe I'm biased. My sister was accepted into the University of Illinois Chicago. Two months in she was diagnosed with Encephalitis. She deteriorated quickly then leveled off. Her mind was like a 10 year old the rest of her life. This happened when I was 9. We would NEVER even consider not including her in anything.

The empathetic option, if the concern is sister getting overwhelmed, would be to ask the venue for a quiet room sister could retreat to as needed, or potentially offer her use of the dressing room. \n\nCheck OP's comments though.

Anna does want to come to the wedding but I think she understands now, so it's okay. I've still involved her in the wedding prep\n\nMy fiance would also rather not have her there.

Her sister\u2019s injury causes some behavioural issues but she\u2019s otherwise able to stay at the hotel alone?  She compares her to not having children under 13, but again, she is capable of staying alone safely. She\u2019s fully capable of understanding that she\u2019s being excluded and she wants to be there. Also, mentioning the fact that without the accident, she would still have conditions on her (the \u201cask her to dress down a bit and not interact with others much\u201d). This sounds like it\u2019s completely personal and she\u2019s just using the accident as an excuse to get rid of her sister.", "Shes a grown woman she did not grow up ignored, a tragic event changed everyones lives, thats life. Imo its inexcusable to shun family for no reason other than her own vanity, as someone else said if she was concerned for the sisters health/wellbeing at the wedding than i could relate but she literally doesnt want to be outshined or overshadowed by a possible 'outburst'. Plenty of people defend selfishness, thats bc they themselves are selfish."]}
