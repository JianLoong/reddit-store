NAH. Leo's perspective is understandable, I presume he's in a dark place and struggling greatly. But you cannot bear the brunt of all of that all the time without any support, and you obviously can't get any from him.\n\nHe needs therapy of some kind for sure. Here's hoping your situation will improve.", "NTA. Your husband is in a mental health crisis. You can\u2019t be the only one who knows and takes care of him. You need help as the caretaker (for this I\u2019d suggest going to people who are not your husbands family) but your husband also needs more help for himself (here, maybe his parents are part of the team). \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that he\u2019s upset and you can validate that. But you both also need more support and help here which involves bringing people into the fold.", "NTA it's been a year and he has to start taking care of his mental health issues. You cannot be expected to handle this issue on your own. He needs help and needs to see his doctor and a therapist", "NAH you needed to let it out and tough things like this can be mentally and physically exhausting. Talking to someone is the healthy thing to do. On the other side Leo is going through a lot and can't blame him for being emotional about this", "INFO and NTA How sad is this that Leo feels like he can\u2019t talk about this?! MANY men experience this in their lives at some point. It is a sad state when people are victimized and violated and can\u2019t talk about it. Your iLs sound great. You hit the jackpot there. I hope Leo sees you aren\u2019t a bad person or you didn\u2019t betray him. This is affecting your spouse and will eventually tear your family apart if he doesn\u2019t get the help he needs.", "NTA. Just because he wants to hold it all in does not mean you have to. I understand he feels betrayed. There's nothing you can do about that. His expectations are not fair. I strongly suggest YOU go to therapy. Dealing with someone else's trauma affects you as well. This is too heavy for you to handle on your own.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t save other people when you\u2019re drowning. You need to protect yourself & your daughter. Your husband is an adult.

I think you also have to explain to your husband that you cannot help him & your first priority is your daughter.

I don\u2019t think the rules of the sub will let me specify what it is, but something happened to Leo around a year ago that was bad. He has been angry, upset, emotional, depressed and just in general a mess. He has been distant with both me and our 3 year old daughter, his close friends and family. I have had to almost be like a caretaker for him as he has spent whole days locked up in our spare room, calling in sick to work and just avoiding the world. I have had to make sure he eats and I have done everything in my power to be there for him. I love him very much and I hate what this has done to him.\n\nIt has taken a toll on me mentally and there are times where Leo will improve but then spiral again. I have not told anybody this as he is my husband and I love him and respect his privacy but I\u2019m at my wits end. He has begged me not to say anything to anyone and I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nIt boiled over the other day when we had a family gathering at the weekend. Leo got very agitated and started arguing with me over the littlest thing and he worked himself up and ran away in tears. My emotions of being under all this pressure finally caught up to me and I ended up breaking down in tears myself in the arms of my FIL. Him and my MIL are absolutely wonderful people and he took me away so we could talk on our own. I didn\u2019t say what happened to my husband, but I said that  my marriage has been tested for the last year and how bad Leo\u2019s emotions have been and how I\u2019m at my own breaking point.\n\nMy FIL told me I need to let it all out and he was in general comforting. He helped me a lot and when I eventually caught up with Leo, I told him everything and right from the off, he was upset. He called me an AH and said I\u2019ve betrayed his trust by revealing the depth of his emotions to his dad when he didn\u2019t want anyone to know. I tried to tell him I\u2019m feeling a lot of stuff too but he is incredibly hurt. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my FIL since as he reached out to  both me and Leo saying how much he loves and cares about both of us and that if we need support or someone to talk to, he is there. Leo is on the defensive against me and his dad, but my FIL says we\u2019re both hurting and nobody\u2019s in the wrong. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Perhaps if he sees that you are  seeing a therapist to deal with your relationship it will help take away the stigma or whatever reason he has in his head.\n\nI wish you all the best.", "NAH. It's tough to be the only support person if your spouse doesn't want to go to therapy or tell anyone else. Was it something sexual in nature? If so, that makes it even harder for some people. Do you think he'd go if you set up an appointment for yourself and then eventually invite him to come?", "OP here. Leo was SA\u2019d on a night out. One of his close friends turned 30 last year and he went on a night out with him and a few others. I was invited to go but I didn\u2019t really know a lot of them that well so I stayed home and looked after our daughter.\n\nHe come home in the early hours like I expected and broke down in tears telling me that at a nightclub they went to, some random guy cornered him in the toilets and SA\u2019d him. He did report it to the police after a few weeks, but there was no CCTV in or near the toilets, he couldn\u2019t remember any key features about the assailant and knows nothing about him. Unfortunately, the police had to drop the case and it has affected Leo on an extreme level.\n\nI blamed myself for a long time for not going and thinking that maybe if id gone, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. Leo has told me himself I\u2019m not to blame and he has confessed to the police dropping the case being a huge blow for him and I think this may be why he\u2019s so reluctant to get help or tell anyone beyond me what happened to him.\n\nHe is deeply ashamed and thinks nobody would ever believe that a man could SA him, another man. I\u2019ve told him that that\u2019s not true at all and that what he went through was real and traumatic but I feel like I\u2019m helpless in helping him. \n\nIt\u2019s killing me seeing him like this.", "NTA, OP. You have been a rock for your husband for the longest time an you still respected him enough not to go into detail. I think society as a whole should be more understanding about trauma and mental illness, however, I also feel that it is still an individuals responsibility to try and improve and not expect their loved ones to suffer for them. Your husband has not taken on that responsibility even given the encouragement. \n\nPlease take care, OP.", "NTA. Is Leo getting any/enough professional help? He sounds like he badly needs it.\n\nI've been through some very dark mental health periods myself and through them it is hard to appreciate what effect it is also having on those close to you.\n\nYou can't shoulder it all yourself and what you did was perfectly understandable. I think when Leo is better he will understand that too.", "Info: Did your husband has a dysfunctional relationship with your FIL?", "NTA - You can't hold the weight of his depression on your shoulders, alone. I would imagine his hurt stems from the depression, he needs to seek professional help for whatever happened to him in the past year. You cannot fix him. He will not get better with time. He needs to actively work on this and get help.", "Tough call but I'd say ESH. Leo was clearly in desperate need of professional help but refused to admit it, and you are kind of an AH for not even telling **his own parents** that he's suffering. This is not a situation you can or should try to resolve yourself, and should've been clear from the start not a year later. Now it's out of the bag for the love of your husband **get him help**.", "OMG NTA, not even a little bit. When your partner is suffering, it takes a toll! You didn't even give details; rather you talked about your feelings. Your husband is going to have to realize that you need and are entitled to support. My partner suffers from severe depression related to his abusive alcoholic mother passing away suddenly. I can relate to the difficulty that comes from supporting a partner who is going through it. Without couples' therapy (which basically has been a way to get him comfortable with therapy at all) and ultimately individual therapy for him, I don't think we'd make it as a couple. Bottom line is that you deserve and need support. If you can't tell friends in your life, tell a therapist.", "NAH.  Leo is in a dark place and, while you've respected his request that you not tell anyone for a year, it hasn't helped.  What happened to Leo is impacting you and your 3-year-old daughter as well. I'm sure you've encouraged Leo to get counseling; whether he goes or not, I hope you consider getting counseling for yourself as well.", "NAH - he was in a dark place and now it's you who needs help too. Of course it was impossible to keep everything inside. \nJust tbh, if it's obvious Leo needs help, it does sound like you might need some too. Please take care. And when Leo gets better he will definitely come around.", "Oh you poor thing. You are absolutely **NTA.**\n\nLeo is angry but he is not being rational, and what he was asking of you was completely unfair. You cannot carry things like this by yourself, or be his entire mental health support system. It's not your job as his wife, and it's not healthy for either of you.\n\nMy psychiatrist, who is a brilliant clinician as well, has a simple but really important saying: \"Family is family. Friends are friends. Doctors are doctors.\" It means exactly what it says: we can each only be what we are meant to be to each other. As his wife, you can love him, and be supportive, and even be a sympathetic ear, but you cannot be his therapist. You are not equipped. And that is what he needs.\n\nWhatever happened to him, it was clearly a genuine trauma, and he needs professional help to process it. That is NON-NEGOTIABLE. He needs it for him, but he also needs it for the sake of your family. And I suggest that you explain it to him that way; it is not about \"ultimatums\" but about letting him know that your family LITERALLY CANNOT SURVIVE if he doesn't get the professional help that he needs, because he is harming you and your child, even if he doesn't mean to, as long as you continue to live together in a house where you are scared and worried for him 24/7, and all she sees is a daddy who is very, very unwell and behaving in ways that are confusing and upsetting to a small child.\n\nNow you need to put your foot down. Tell Leo that you love him more than anything, but that he needs to seek help, or you are going to have to talk separation. Not as a punishment - no one is looking to punish him, you love him more than anything - but because you need to prioritise YOUR mental health and your little girl's. He is drowning, and you cannot let him pull you under with him.\n\nI'm really proud of YOU for asking for help instead of suffering in silence. You're a great wife and mom. And you are absolutely NTA.", "NTA What I'm reading is something very traumatic happened to your husband and he is feeling a whirlwind of emotions and he is not addressing them. What it sounds like he was a victim of something terrible. You did not betray him because you never told your FIL what actually happened. They witnessed his quasi melt-down right then and there and you told your FIL in-law how it's been a rough year. It doesn't sound like you gave his secret away. Just... it's been hard.   \nIf I may make a few suggestions. It's a long shot and I admit I am assuming he was a victim of a crime. Forgive me if I am way off. You are being very supportive but there is only so much you can do and whatever trauma he has suffered, we can only help people if they allow us to and also if they're willing to help themselves. It can take its toll on those supporting them as well. Whatever happened to him is affecting you and probably your child. Perhaps find a therapist  for yourself to bounce things off of and help you maneuver through this delicate minefield you've been thrown into.  It's taking its toll on you, too. Also, if he was a victim of a crime and you live in the US there are Victim's Assistance programs available.  Best wishes to you.", "NAH. However I would h", "I honestly have mixed feelings.\n\nI don't think you're an AH for reaching a breaking point with this, you obviously needed to let this out and lift a weight off your chest. That's valid.\n\nHowever, I think it would've been better to talk to a therapist about it instead of his family, to maintain confidentiality. He should have the right to his privacy when it comes to his personal matters.\n\nHe didn't want his family to know and you took that option away from him, before he was ready to talk about it. Which sort of makes YTA.\n\nI don't blame you though, you're human and you obviously needed to let off some steam. Maybe what you both need at this point is therapy.\n\nEdit: typo", "He\u2019s in a very dark place and it feels like nothing I do can help him", "This. You should be in good head space yourself in order to help others, otherwise you spiral together. \nNTA, but therapy all around.", "He has refused everything that has been suggested.", "No. Leo\u2019s parents have always been loving, wonderful and accepting of him and his 2 siblings. \n\nI think the reason he doesn\u2019t want or didn\u2019t want anyone knowing is because of his extreme emotional reaction and he\u2019s deeply ashamed about what happened to him even though it\u2019s not his fault ay all", "I have tried. I\u2019ve tried gently nudging him, I\u2019ve told him outright and he won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know what I can do to help him.", "Great advice.", "Your in-laws sound like fantastic people, so maybe they can help. It's definitely concerning that even they had no idea of what happened with Leo, but I absolutely agree with your FIL's opinion.\n\nAnd indeed, you can't help him directly. Whatever he is suffering from, this requires a professional. And somehow or other, he *has* to go to one, else, well, that marriage cannot continue like this.", "You need to sit down with him and explain that this isn't going to work - he needs to get help because you cannot be expected to live like this forever. You also deserve a life.", "NTA. Hope everything well for you.", " I am so sorry for you and your family . Your husband needs therapy I am sorry he is not willing to go. Please accept hug from an internet stranger.", "They\u2019re honestly the parents I wish I had. My father passed away and I\u2019m estranged from my mother so having my in laws be so wonderful to me has been amazing."]}
