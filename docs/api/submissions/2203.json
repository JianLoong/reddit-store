What about a part-time job while he looks for a better full time job?\n\nHeck, no one will even remember what \"belt-set\" he wore to the wedding.  His behavior sounds ridiculous.\n\nI think you are great to cancel the card - and it truly was stolen.

You deserve so much better.\n\nNTA", "Oh sweetie, NTA. I\u2019m the breadwinner in my house at the moment and things are tight adjacent. Husband makes less and has more bills so I pick up all the slack. I say that to say, I get it. However, no way in hell would my husband attempt to steal from me. I need you to understand what happened. Your husband was willing and ready to steal your money in order to purchase something he didn\u2019t need and that you\u2019d already said you weren\u2019t willing to pay for. When a relationship devolves to this level there are only 2 options, immediate therapy (avoid if husband is abusive) or separation. Imagine finding out you had poison in your arm, you either aggressively treat or cut the whole thing off.", "Nta, abusers often call their victims abusers- get this man out of your life.", "NTA.

BS. \"Oh, honey, I'd really appreciate it if you would pretty please give me back my credit card.\" He's trying to distract from his action by focusing on your response.", "**NTA** \n\nYour are not required to ask a thief nicely to return your property. \n\nHusband owes you a big apology.", "NTA. Claiming \"financial abuse\" is nonsense. He's unemployed and you're supporting him, and his response to that is to steal (yes, steal) the credit card and forcing you to go without medication.", "NTA, it\u2019s not financial abuse when you catch someone stealing and make them give it back. Ask nicely is something you say to a five year old.", "This can't be the first time he's done something like this? As described, this is extremely abusive behavior. At the very least, it's incredibly immature. Socially and emotionally immature. \n\nYou should seek therapy, talk to others about this and any similar behavior, and start making it known that you are experiencing this from him. People who know you personally can help clarify this sort of behavior.\n\nNTA - there isn't a single thing here you did wrong. You are totally within reason and within your rights to say no to his ask for your personal money to purchase extras during a financially strained season. You are completely justified in demanding your card back and not asking nicely for it. He didn't ask nicely to take it. Stay strong, don't give in to his demands, not even the little ones like 'ask nicely' because it may very well escalate from there. And please seek help in your real life.\n\nIf this is the first time this sort of behavior has happened and you've otherwise had a healthy marriage, it could be a sign of how he dysfunctionally handles stress in life. Everything still stands, but might be worth marriage counseling and encouraging him to seek individual therapy as well.", "NTA!

Time to have a serious conversation because that is absolutely not okay.", "NTA. Look, the situation you're describing is just plain old abuse. He took your card *without permission* knowing that you had already said no to an unnecessary expense that he was not able to pay for himself. He then *doubled down* and demanded that you speak to him politely to get your card back. *He stole from you and tried to make out like he was the bigger person*.\n\nYou have much larger problems than how you speak to your husband. Sure, there were options other than cancelling your card (I love that move by the way, but investigate if you can temporarily \"lock\" your card instead).

There\u2019s almost always work around if you\u2019re not fussy. \n\nThe fact he wouldn\u2019t give it back, and was so patronising is a massive \ud83d\udea9 \n\nBlaming you and calling you the abuser, another \ud83d\udea9 \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA, and I hope that you can communicate that to your husband and get the apology you deserve", "NTA.

Nta", "You have a manipulative and borderline abusive husband..", "NTA. He stole from you. YOUR HUSBAND STOLE FROM YOU. You can't trust him. Take your new credit card when it arrives and get a cheap safe because he WILL do it again. Or kick him the fuck out of your house and your life, that would also work.", "NTA. You told him you couldn't afford the expense and he tried to do it anyway with YOUR card. You caught him and he turned it around on you. Make sure you keep your new card where he can't access it. He is taking advantage of you. Stealing from you is financial abuse.", "NTA. That isn\u2019t financial abuse. He attempted to steal your card to purchase something that wasn\u2019t necessary and that you two did not agree on purchasing due to your current financial situation. He\u2019s dishonest and acting like a massive child.", "NTA.\nThat\u2019s guilt-tripping from your partner. It\u2019s not okay. \nIn this case he\u2019s the one financially abusing you, while trying to make you feel guilty. You did the right thing. \n\nHowever, you should talk about the family dinamics and financial situation. \n\nYou\u2019re the main breadwinner currently. Does he do the housework in full and supports you with your work, or he\u2019s just stying home and whining? If he helps you, some flexibility is ok in deciding what you\u2019re spending your money on. \nIf he\u2019s passive and does not help you, you have the right to decide what is purchased by you. \nBut still, the \u2018ask me nicely\u2019 move from his part is not okay under any circumstances.", "NTA\n\nHusband was like \"if I can't have the money I will at least have dominance, that way when I give it back my ego will remain in tact because she is still beneath me\".\n\nIts incredibly pathetic and not something you should cater to.", "NTA. He\u2019s being manipulative and controlling. The fact that he wanted you to \u201cask nicely\u201d to get back something he stole instead of giving it back is infuriating.

I\u2019m sorry your lame-ass husband\u2019s lack of job has put you all into such financial bad straits that you are forced to use a credit card for basic necessities.

No wonder he has no job.... divorce this ah.", "NTA  - ur funding EVERYTHING and he wants to spend UR CASH  on a designer thing - even I would know that's a def NO NO", "NTA Throwaway the husband get a new card.", "Absolutely NTA. You did the right thing cancelling it in prevention. However, you shouldn't HAVE to cancel your credit card to prevent your husband from stealing money. \n\nIf you don't want to leave him, I'd seriously tell him to shape the fuck up. When you can afford it, consider therapy. That was seriously abusive and manipulative. He caused you to not be able to buy groceries and to not be able to buy pain medication then threw it on you to avoid blame. \n\nI hope he eventually finds a job and makes this up to you. I'll probably be the nicest comment towards the husband but let me make it clear: That was not okay and I totally get hardship, but you all are married. He cannot behave like a child and take it out on his support. Those vows are going to mean fuck all.", "NTA. He stole the card for a fucking designer belt. He is not entitled to any gentleness in how you get the card back. It would probably be a good idea to go back over the statements to make sure this is not the first time.

He\u2019s a child.", "NTA - he stole from you and then demanded you apologize for getting mad about it.  That is typical gaslighting behavior.  He is making you out to be the bad guy for something he did and then claiming abuse.  His gaslighting is abuse.  My ex did the same type of stuff to me but I wasn\u2019t able to see it for what it was until we divorced.", "NTA. If your finances are that tight that groceries are on credit, he needs to check his BS.", "Nta. Honestly - you should have asked nicely. A simple \"Mr. Police Officer - my credit card has been stolen. Could you please arrest the thief?\" Would have solved everything.\n\nJust in case it needs to be said.

I hope he wakes up on the couch and realises that he isn't a victim here and accusing you of abuse when he was attempting to steal shows his true character. \n\nIt's easy for an internet stranger.like me to say dump him but if you see a way out, take it.", "NTA You did the right thing not giving into his abusive \"ask nicely\" demand. I hope you filed for divorce because he doesn't deserve your financial support or your love.", "NTA but OP, please snap out of it! He _stole_ your credit card so he could spend YOUR MONEY without your permission! Why wouldn\u2019t you demand it back? Now you\u2019re going to have to always hide your money/cards from him, oof.", "NTA at all! If you use a mobile app for your credit card, a lot of the time they have a freeze option that you can turn on and off as needed, if you have this option it might be wise to keep your credit card locked and only unlock when you know you will be using it personally for a purchase.", "NTA - Your husband stole your credit card, refused to give it back until you gave into some sort of power play.  He further showed lack of judgement by intending to buy an unnecessary luxury when you don't have the $ to pay in cash for basic necessities like food & medicine.

Because any reasonable person would have reacted the exact same way as you did, and I\u2019m sure if you think objectively about your relationship that this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done something mean and irrational and tried to justify it. \n\nYour life can get a lot easier if you kick him to the curb and worry about yourself. I say this as someone who has been in terrible relationships with terrible people\u2014 don\u2019t let your love for him make you stay because this is what the rest of your life will look like. \n\nGood luck, OP.

If that\u2019s the case, I can understand wanting a new belt\u2026but not an expensive designer set!\n\nRegardless, none of that justifies his stealing your credit card and then saying you\u2019re financially abusing him.

If the information does coincide with the way that you're living then there's also a couple chapters on being able to get out safely.\n I wish you the best of luck and I want you to know that you deserve to be with a partner who is going to love you and cherish you and treat you as an equal versus being with someone who's gonna control you be it by how you dress or by finances or by What it is that you can do or who you can see. You deserve so much BETTER we're here rooting for you!\n\n\nhttps://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "Indeed, this is the answer.", "This right here. My spouse and I have been through tough times, but even though I'm the primary breadwinner, we're always on the same page in terms of what we need and what we don't need. And we discuss whether or not something is needed together.\n\nYour husband is incredibly immature and selfish to think a fancy belt set for a ONE-TIME event is a priority for the budget when he's unemployed. And the fact he stole your credit card to buy it puts him in seriously dangerous territory. I hate when AITA jumps to it, but I recommend couples therapy ASAP.", "100% this. My partner recently went through a period of unemployment. I was able to cover us and we avoided eating into savings. My husband cut out all non essential costs from his life to be as frugal as possible to assist. Not something I pushed him to do, I actually suggested he do some gym glasses for his own health as I knew he loved them but he went for walks with a podcast to cut costs. I gave my husband a duplicate credit card linked to mine as he had more time to get our groceries and take the car up to the mechanic etc. All costs were discussed together as a partnership. \n\nIf he had stolen from me and/or treated me in this manner I would have been shocked and re-evaluated our whole relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t think I could trust them again without intensively discussing this with a professional.", "Distract AND claw back power over the situation and OP. That's all he had to grasp at here - he feels powerless having no income and having to beg and steal for what he wants. When he can't get his way through begging and  stealing, he tries a power trip to make himself feel better. Op is NTA and better off without this nonsense.", "You could have called  the police  on the non emergency line also. He stole your card after all. Nta", "Next thing we hear, it's a criminal telling the police he'll hold his hands up only if the cops ask him nicely, with a pretty please on top...", ">As the saying goes \"we don't negotiate with terrorists\".\n\nI love this and used to tell my kids this when they started to throw tantrums to get what they wanted.", "Many cards let you temporarily freeze, often very easily via the app or website, but usually once it's canceled, that's it.

Her husband is attempting to buy expensive belts on his wife's money. She points out that it's her money and that they are in bad financial times. He attempted to steal her own credit card behind her back. In response, he calls this \"financial abuse.\" This is all on him. He needs to get on the same page financially, and that page is, \"thank you wife for supporting us while I look for a job. I won't spend superfluous money.\"", "Is there a translation for this?", "What?", "This isn\u2019t abuse\u2026.? He stole her credit card, husband or not.

If anything OP is the victim of financial abuse not the guy claiming it.\nHe stole her credit card with the intent to put her in debt (that\u2019s abuse) he doesn\u2019t have a job and is expecting her to cover every cost and then accuses her with insults after she repeatedly said no (that\u2019s abuse)\n\nThe only person being abused in this situation is OP\n\nOp please take people\u2019s advice and leave this toxic situation before you are unable to and saddled with mountains of debt.

At that point the abuser leans back and smiles because now they can look like the sane one and easily convince people like OP that they're the ones acting crazy and unreasonable. Especially since at that point the abuser has worn down their host enough that it's easy to gaslight them and create a warped reality.", "It's one thing to pay the rent and buy food until they can find another job, but luxury items are off the table. When one of you is struggling both of you are struggling. If she hadn't cancelled the card I doubt he would have given it back to her until after he'd made the purchase, because she still wouldn't have asked nicely enough or been reasonable enough about \"his needs.\" She is definitely NTA. Personally I would have waited until he charged something, and then they would be opening a fraud investigation, because we discussed it and I did not agree, so he stole my credit card. She's far nicer than I would have been. I would have instigated criminal proceedings.", "Not to mention, holding the card hostage and demanding she ask nicely is just a power play so that he can force her to dance to his tune. He has to be in control. It\u2019s like when a bigger kid dangles a stolen toy over a younger kid and says \u201cask nicely\u201d while the little kid stands there, helpless and angry.

My husband will give me a heads up about getting lunch multiple times in 1 week. Not as a permission thing but just as a courtesy so money stays where it\u2019s needed. This is appalling and the fact that OP is questioning herself makes me sick.", "Can someone just tell me what a \u201cbelt set\u201d is real quick?", "My husband tried to make himself as financially small as possible to not be a burden. Like you, I encourage him to still do things he enjoys because I don\u2019t want him to punish himself.

This isn't some sort of complicated relationship dynamic thing or miscommunication. Few situations are black-and-white but this is one of them. He's being a huge asshole and he knows he is.

Lundy Bancroft pretty much denies the fact men can be victims of domestic abuse, waving it off by saying most men who claim to be abused are actually themselves abusers. He\u2019s also had allegations of a sexual nature against him before.\n\nFrom his book: \n\n\u201cEven if abused men didn\u2019t want to come forward, they would have been discovered by now. Neighbors don\u2019t turn a deaf ear to abuse the way they might have ten or twenty years ago. Now, when people hear screaming, objects smashing against walls, loud slaps landing on skin, they call the police. Among my physically abusive clients, nearly one-third have been arrested as a result of a call to the police that came from someone other than the abused woman. If there were millions of cowed, trembling men out there, the police would be finding them.\n\nAbusive men commonly like to play the role of victim, and most men who claim to be \u201cbattered men\u201d are actually the perpetrators of violence, not the victims.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t deny he has some genuinely good observations in the book, but it\u2019s definitely a book intended for female victims, not male ones.", "The thing is, she did communicate and set a clear boundary and her husband did not give a single f$&!

If you've never experienced gaslighting, then it wouldn't seem important to actually know what it is, but if you have been, then it makes a difference.
