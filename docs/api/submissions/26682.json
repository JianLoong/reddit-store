Simply ask them.", "NTA\n\nThe bride cleared it.\n\nI wonder if the suit photographed as more white than cream and that's why they changed it?", "Not wearing white to someone else's wedding is usually a rule for dresses, so everyone's attention stays on the bride.

It's not like anyone was going to mistake you for the bride!", "NTA. The bride approved the suit. If it bothered her, she should have said something when you asked. That said, they're being ridiculous. The main idea behind not wearing white to a wedding is to not upstage the bride, and not be mistaken for the bride. I 100% guarantee you nobody mistook you for the bride\n\nThat said, if they want to change your suit color in the pictures, just leave it alone", "NTA.  You asked the bride and she approved.\n\nAlso, I haven't heard of any issue with a man wearing a cream suit to a wedding, especially when it's not likely that he would be confused with the bride.  Maybe it would be an issue for a same sex wedding though.\n\nIf you're really concerned, check in with the bride and groom.", "NTA. You had permission from the bride. Don't read too much into the colour change, it will have been done as much to prevent others from commenting as anything else", "INFO:\n\nWhy did the bride approve of your suit selection, and then ask to have you suit color changed in the photos?", "NTA. The bride approved your outfit.

You asked for permission and it was granted, but I can also see why they would alter the colour later on since it can look funny in the pictures.

It may have looked fine in person but the colors might not have shown up well in the photos so they wanted it to just be edited.", "Cream and white are two different colour to me. \nPlus you asked. \nPlus nobody had the face to tell you anything.\nSounds like a bunch of hypocrites.\nNTA", "NTA, but my goodness. Are you sure no one confused you for the bride? It was cream colored. CREAM colored! /s", "NTA You had permission.

You created a no-win situation for yourself.", "NTA, but I guess it\u2019s nice that the \u201cdon\u2019t wear white\u201d rule extends to men as well as women", "NTA - You asked, got approval and its ok.  I don't get this obsession about colours at weddings.  When I got married, we told everyone to wear what they wanted.  And I've been to weddings were everyone was asked to wear white.  No one or nothing will take the center of attention away from the happy couple if you don't allow it", "ESH. You never wear white-ish clothes to a wedding. Sure she approved it. She also was doing 500 things as well. \n\nAlso why didn\u2019t someone say something to you from jump. It\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t see you before the wedding started. Those are bad friends. Instead they stood around and talked behind your back the entire time. And then recolored your suit in the wedding photos. Not cool.", "On the fence here.  Yes, OP cleared it with the bride first, and she was ok with it.  But, cream is too close to white, so OP should have known better.  Why couldn't he have worn a black or navy suit?", "[deleted]", "INFO: did the groom wear white?", "NTA. But who wears white (cream same thing) to someone elses wedding?", "NTA. White and Cream are two different colors\u2026.that\u2019s why they have different names lol. Everyone can kick rocks since the bride okayed it. I wouldn\u2019t worry about the touch ups to the color as the lighting might have made it appear lighter in the photos so they edited it.", "YTA for lacking wedding etiquette. \nIf you have to ask for color approval, the answer is most likely no. The bride doesn\u2019t need pressure from family over outfit selections, you are an adult. You should know better here. She probably didn\u2019t want to hurt you or have an added expense. And Of course no one will make a scene at the wedding. You were that guy, just take the L.\n\nA lot of wedding photographers specifically offer this photoshop service. Your suit definitely looked white in photos, making you look like the groom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
