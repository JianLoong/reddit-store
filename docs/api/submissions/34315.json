Her dressing in \"revealing\" cloths doesn't mean she's asking for unwanted attention. You're also not her parent.

You're a group of friends going out drinking not coworkers trying to close a deal.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not right or ideal or great, but the sad fact of the world is that dressing provocatively draws attention. If that's the not the type of attention you want, you gotta tone down the amount of skin you are showing.", "Ehhh. I mean imo it\u2019s never a *great* thing to tell a woman she should change her outfit.

I\u2019m gonna go with NTA. but I think you should have a private conversation with your friend in which you discuss how it\u2019s *not her fault*, but  you\u2019ve been feeling uncomfortable with being the guy who has to fend off the creeps. I wouldn\u2019t make any suggestions that she change her style, just let her know how you\u2019ve been feeling in a respectful way that shows you empathize with her.\n\nI will leave you with this though: your friend is probably going to get harassed no matter what she\u2019s wearing. It may decrease the intensity or amount of cat calling, but it will likely not go away completely. So if you\u2019re not comfortable being the designated creep repeller, maybe invite some other guys along next time or take a break from going out with them all together. I wish you both the best!", "Probably going to get downvoted here but YTA. She shouldn't be told to 'tone down an outfit' or feel like she should wear something else because it is 'inevitable' she's going to get harassed. This is a problem for the men harassing her, not her. It's good that you said you don't want her to feel blamed for it, because you're right the clothing she wears doesn't determine whether she is going to get harassed. I don't think it's fair if you're constantly arguing with guys over this, but even if you were to stick up for her it would be the right thing to do regardless. If my friend was wearing a 'revealing' outfit and was harassed, I would stick up for them anyway because choice of clothing doesn't welcome unwanted attention. The fact you did say 'inevitable' harassment though, to me, sounds like you agree that the clothing she wears warrants for harassment or it is expected, when we should all be free and comfortable to wear what we want without having to worry about being harassed. This is a problem for the creeps not her!", "YTA.\n\nIt's none of your business what she wears. Women get harassed no matter what they wear. One woman I know dressed practically like an Amish woman as an experiment for a month and she actually got harassed MORE. Possibly because she presented a challenge? Who knows.\n\nYou aren't obligated to step in when your friends are being harassed. It's a nice thing to do but you're obviously not happy to do it, so don't. But ffs, don't blame it on your women friends when they get harassed.", "YTA women can get harassed even when they are in trousers and turtlenecks dude, you are an awful friend if you are getting annoyed at your her instead of the creepy men.", "Sorry but YTA. Because as a guy, it\u2019s not really cool to comment on what she should or should not wear. It\u2019s a little cringe. You can say \u2018just as a heads up, it\u2019s cold outside so maybe grab a jacket\u2019 but don\u2019t imply she\u2019s underdressed or dressed inappropriately in any manner. \n\nAnd I agree with others that she shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for the actions of the men around her. When I was in uni, there was one neighborhood I\u2019d walk through that I\u2019d get catcalled every evening. Didn\u2019t matter what I wore unless I was covered head to toe and wrapped a scarf around my head (this was in Western Europe). So for all you know, dressing down won\u2019t have an impact.", "YTA. Don't be paternalistic with your friends. I understand that you're trying to manage the night to be more fun for everyone, but telling someone how to dress isn't a good way to do that. Maybe next time you could suggest a venue that will be less of a meat market and see if your friends agree.", "YTA. It's not your job to play body guard, women have been sexually harassed in sweats and t shirts before. Outfits isn't your job either, unless your advice is requested.", "YTA. Poor you, having to deal with the discomfort of someone else being harassed. Smh. The fact that you knew well enough not to openly slut shame her tells me that you already knew the answer to this.

That\u2019s so patronizing.", "YTA \n\nI'm sure she's well aware of the potential for harassment due to her past experiences but you have no right to ask her to change her outfit. \n\nClothes are a personal choice. Women have been raped when being fully clothed.\n\nEDIT: I know you're trying to protect her.", "NTA If you\u2019re expected to act as her bodyguard then it is okay.", "YTA because this isn\u2019t really about your friend. It\u2019s about how your *other* friends treat you when your friend gets approached by people.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve mentioned so far about this situation is that your friend gets more unwanted attention when she dresses a certain way and that your other friends judge you for not protecting her or speaking up. \n\nIf your issue is with your other friends then you need to have a conversation with those friends. However, in order to avoid that talk you instead asked your friend to wear something else. \n\nThe issue as you stated it makes it seem like your actions didn\u2019t come from a place of your friend\u2019s best interest but instead from a place of your convenience. It turns your problem - the judgement of your other friends - into your friend\u2019s problem. \n\nThat reasoning makes you the A.\n\nNow, if your friend has come to you and expressed she\u2019s feeling harassed, or has made clear she expects you to essentially be a bodyguard, or has in some other way made clear she has a problem and is bringing you into the situation, then things are a bit different.\n\nHowever, the way you\u2019ve written this doesn\u2019t make clear your friend even sees the attention she\u2019s getting as problematic, only that others find it so.\n\nAgain, if your friend is stating that she\u2019s uncomfortable and feeling harassed, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s problematic for a close friend to point out to her when her outfits are inappropriate or atypical for a venue and that they may single her out. I also don\u2019t think it would wrong to have a private conversation with her if she\u2019s relying on you for safety.\n\nBut neither of those things are what happened here. \n\nThis situation seems to call for some tough conversations - with your other friends, with this particular friend, or both.\n\nAvoidance and deflection won\u2019t solve anything.", "YTA. You asking her to do this was based on sexist assumptions and victim-blaming. Neither your friend nor her clothes are  responsible for the men who harass her - they're responsible for their own actions.", "YTA.\n\nYou are the asshole for several reasons. For starters, you lied to her. You had one reason for wanting her to change, but you told her a different reason. I think she saw through your lie anyway, so whatever you were trying to accomplish by lying, it didn't work.\n\nSecond, you are policing her clothing. That's her choice, not your choice. If you want to talk about it that's fine, but that gets back to the starting point which is that you lied instead of raising it as a topic to discuss.\n\nAnd finally, you seem to be blaming her for guys harassing her. She's allowed to dress sexy if she wants. That doesn't mean she should get harassed.", "Dude, the solution is simple. Stop going out when she's going to be there, or learn to zip your lip. She's never asked you to do it, so don't. If she starts to ask or complain, that's the point at which you tactfully say, \"You're a strong, independent woman. I believe in you and your ability to defend yourself.\"\n\nAll that without commenting on her clothing at any point.", "NTA. I would actually have told her my real reasoning though. In a kind and respectful way. She shouldn't HAVE to watch what she wears, but you actually DO need to do that as a woman.  Dressing modestly wont keep 100% of the  harassment at bay but it doesn't INVITE it either. The one is looking for trouble. People dont get that there's a fine line between victim blaming and just realizing that people respond to the cues we give them. Dressing like a piece of meat will invite scummy men to treat you like a piece of meat. :(", "YTA coz nor your friend nor what clothes she wears are the issue when it comes to this.

That being said, unless you have a conversation with her and clearly outline your boundaries in terms of your willingness (or lack thereof) to step in when she gets harassed you're just kicking the can down the road and you will either have to continue to ask her to change her outfits (and that WILL make you the AH) or you'll have to continue to deal with her getting harassed, in one way or another.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nWhat she wears has nothing to do with you.  She can wear what she wants.  It's the other people who give her unwarranted attention you should be concentrating on.  Give THEM unwarranted attention, not bother your friend.", "Gonna say something controversial and go with YTA. I don\u2019t know when people started viewing every interaction with their friends as transactional instead of viewing them as a part of their community. Women face undue harassment regardless of what they wear. You\u2019re right, if you don\u2019t speak up for your friends, you would face backlash. But that\u2019s not just because you\u2019re the man in the group; it\u2019s because if someone you consider a friend is being harassed, you should WANT to stand up for them. \n\nI will be really honest here. If you think it\u2019s too much responsibility or stress for YOU to have to put up with your friend being harassed, maybe you should just not be her friend or stop hanging out with her.

It crosses into asshole territory when making a choice to ignore this reality and expect someone else to \"protect\" me from bad actors.\n\nThis is like me walking down a dark alley in a bad part of town, wearing expensive things and getting mugged. Then expecting my friend to protect me from the mugger. Is the mugger \"right\"?

You acknowledge that she is blameless for the actions of others and that she should always be able to wear what she wants.

She can wear whatever she wants but her and your other friends don't get to expect you to jump to their defense every time because shes chooses to continue  wearing revealing clothing.

You are correct to say women will be assaulted regardless of outfit choice however there are outfits that bring more attention to you. Does that mean you shouldn\u2019t wear those outfits? In my opinion you should wear whatever you want but maybe don\u2019t drink so you can be aware of your surroundings and get yourself help if necessary rather than relying on the one guy in the group to bail you out every time while you can realistically provide no assistance since you\u2019re intoxicated.

I specifically said people should dress how they want. Stating certain outfits will bring more unwanted attention is a fact. That doesn\u2019t mean the outfit is revealing. Flamboyant outfits, very bright outfits, eccentric outfits, revealing outfits all bring more attention than outfits that would be considered more plain or neutral colors. What makes all his friends \u201cbad friends\u201d and I use that term loosely is the expectation he will jump in to defend them as the only male in the group. In my example on how to approach the conversation I even said he can set the expectation- he will not jump in to defend her and she can choose how she wants to proceed in what she wears out. I never said tell her to change nor am I saying she\u2019s wrong for wearing whatever she wants. I don\u2019t even know if what she\u2019s wearing is even really \u201crevealing\u201d as that is subjective and different people will have different opinions on what is \u201ctoo revealing\u201d. I also stated regardless of what a female wears she can be assaulted. At the end of the day yes an outfit can draw more attention to you because that\u2019s just a fact things that are outside of what is considered social norms draw more attention but a person who assaults somebody will do it regardless of what the person is wearing or what they look like. My point is stating the outfit choice will bring more attention is simply that saying with that outfit you will draw more eyes to you.", "I think the real problem is wherever they are going for drinks.
