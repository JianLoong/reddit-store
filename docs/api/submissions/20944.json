I admit the first few days I did make him alternative meals but I can\u2019t keep doing that every time because he made a decision. Yesterday we ordered pizza for dinner, the rest of the family wanted pepperoni. My son expected me to order him a separate cheese pizza. I told him if he wanted it he had to buy it himself. Then he basically threw a whole tantrum saying I don\u2019t respect his religion. Then he went on to say I\u2019m being unfair and I have double standards because I make his sister alternative food but not him. \n\nI do get where he\u2019s coming from and maybe I am being a little unfair, but my daughter has an actual health condition and this is something he chose.

There's a difference between choice and a health condition. And you did make an effort to try to make some alternatives for him. But he is an adult and needs to realize there are consequences to his choices. Sometimes good and sometimes bad. Your daughter is your main priority when it comes to foods that can or cannot be eaten since she is still a minor and its a serious health issue. Your son can handle getting his own food now that he is an adult. Whether it's a religion or someone going vegan, they can't expect everyone to get behind on their food choices.", "Info: how is your daughter eating the pepperoni pizza? Are you ordering it without cheese and expecting everyone to eat it? Or is she taking the cheese off and rendering the pepperoni useless anyway?", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is not yet an adult and has a medical reason for needing a lactose free diet.\n\nYour son is an adult and has made a decision on which religion he has chosen to follow which includes a dietary consideration, as an adult he can also buy his own food", "NTA\n\nLactose intolerant is a medical (albeit minor) issue\n\nConverting to Islam and not wanting to eat certain foods is a personal choice. You could offer to teach him how to cook so he can make his own meals?\n\nHe can\u2019t expect everyone around him to change their lifestyle to conform to his personal choices", "INFO: does your son have a job? would you allow him to use your ingredients to make meals for himself? Also what is the alternative for your daughter? Like is it just another sauce or a full alternate dish?", "For this VERY specific example of getting pizza for the whole family, yes YTA. You would have to get a dairy alternative pizza for your daughter so why not a meat alternative for your son? \n\nNo I don\u2019t think you should COOK extra meals for your son. You are used to cooking dairy free and it\u2019s probably how you cook for everyone so it\u2019s not a hardship, but cooking without pork seems to be a hardship and I wouldn\u2019t do that. So you are NTA to not want to cook alternative meals.", "NTA. Your son is an adult he can start cooking his own food\u2026", "Absolutely YTA. You are favoring your daughter over your son. I would hate you if you were my dad.", "YTA - Serving alternative food for one child but not the other? That's one hell of a sibling rivalry waiting to happen.", "I will say YTA. I don\u2019t think you should make him a different meal, but you should buy another protein and tell him to prepare it himself when you guys are eating pork. Also, why not just buy him a seperate pizza? Seems very unfair. He is only 18, it doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. He should be able to order a pizza he likes, but also, he can cook for himself (you should pay for it though).", "Seriously? YTA. Do you want your son to feel welcome in your family\u2019s home? Or do you not? These are the kinds of signals that screw up kids for life. Are you really willing to do this over the cost of a pizza and some menu planning? \n\nThis has nothing to do with your daughter or her nutrition needs whatsoever. This is about you. \n\nIf you have a problem with his new religion, that\u2019s your issue to manage. Perhaps have a calm adult conversation with him and ask why he chose that religion and how he is benefiting from it.\n\nIf the meal planning requires new recipes or extra time, certainly engage your son in that.", "If he became Catholic and refused to eat meat for Lent, would your stance be the same?", "Not gonna be a popular response, but yes, YTA. It\u2019s not much of a change to lessen the amount of pork products you consume while he is home from school. It\u2019s not that hard to order a small pizza for him. Did you even ask him if making the pizza half cheese and half pepperoni would be okay for him? Or if there was another option available from where you ordered pizza that isn\u2019t an entire pizza? \n\nA lot of these responses say he\u2019s an adult. Yeah, he\u2019s 18. But that doesn\u2019t make him an adult, either. He can\u2019t smoke, he can\u2019t drink, he lives at home while not at college\u2026.. he\u2019s still a child. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to cook for him, don\u2019t. Being an asshole isn\u2019t illegal, nor is it abusive. \n\nHe could have easily told you that he developed some sort of intolerance to pork. He didn\u2019t have to disclose he decided to convert. He trusted you with something pretty controversial, and you\u2019re essentially giving him a huge middle finger. \n\nBuy chicken or beef or turkey. You can go without pork for 3 months of the year in order to support your kid and show him the unconditional love and acceptance he deserves.", "NTA but you\u2019re on a thin ice.\n\nYou\u2019re probably bad at communicating with your son. If you explained to him that you are not going to cook meals according to his religious preferences but you\u2019re happy to help getting groceries for him and he has to cook himself then you\u2019d be a 100% NTA. But it seems you\u2019re being intentionally confrontational here and deep down disapproving of his religious choices so you choose to punish him by demonstratively not accommodating his dietary restrictions. Your daughter here is pretty much irrelevant, situation would be the same with it without her in the picture.", "NTA for not cooking special food for him, since he can make himself food or a second side when you have pork; he is an adult.\n\nHowever, YTA for not ordering a second small pizza or ordering one everyone can eat. You are ordering food, so it's not a \"vote\" situation. Everyone would have eaten without pepperoni so you left him out because nobody wanted to compromise. Also, you are so cheap that you cannot order him a small cheese pizza? Really?\n\nHe is also a full-time student so you are on thin ice on the adult situation. If you wanted him to get his own groceries you should have told him he needed a summer job way before.", "YTA. It would have been so easy to order a small cheese pizza for him. Even if he just didn't like pepperoni and wanted a different pizza it shouldn't be a big deal, you're just deliberately excluding your son (who at 18 is barely an adult, let's be honest).", "YTA. \n\nI came home from college as a vegetarian & then later as a vegan. My family always accommodated me. I\u2019m no longer vegan, but I\u2019ve been vegetarian for over 15 years. My aunt figured out how to make our traditional family dishes vegetarian. My family is dysfunctional, & still makes jokes about my reactions this one time I inhaled a 7-layer dip & found out after digging in that there was meat, but they always have made sure I am accommodated for. Now that I\u2019m very much an adult (not just an 18-21 year old), I make & bring a dish for Christmas. \n\nYour approach is a bit harsh & honestly a bit rude. Getting an extra pizza without pepperoni is not a big deal & goes along way to include your son. \n\nYou need to apologize to him & make sure he knows that he is welcome in your home & life. \n\nIt is not unreasonable for you to make some decisions with your son about how he can contribute to meals by cooking for holidays, but he\u2019s still a young person making his way in the world & you should continue to be supportive.", "NAH\n\nYour son is an adult who has voluntarily chosen to add some dietary restrictions to his life. He cannot expect everyone to accommodate for that.\n\nBut at the same time, he just came back from college- likely his first time living away from family for an extended period- and made a big decision (converting) that often leads to rejection from family.  He's likely looking for your love and support right now.", "Could you maybe next time get a pizza 1/2 cheese 1/2 pepperoni? Some places even let you only put a topping a 1/4 pizza. Seems fair.", "YTA. Do you know how easy it is to get half-half pizza? Half of pepperoni, half of something else. You can also easily make dishes that either simply don't have pork (try chicken or fish- you need variety in your diet anyway), or make it easier for your son to take out the meat.\n\nI recently started having meat free days, while my partner has meat. I just roast or grill the meat and stir fry the veggies we would have with the meat anyway. It is a simple step that wouldn't be getting out of your way.\n\nBased on your tone, it really seems that you are targeting your son for being Muslim.", "YTA - this is the reason your son will be going no contact with you in the future. You could have easily asked for half cheese pizza and not made a fuss but you wanted to prove a point. I sense that you are mad about him turning to Islam and have made it a point to make him an outcast.", "NAH.\n\nI developed a pork sensitivity in adulthood (do not recommend). If son had a pork sensitivity now, you\u2019d obviously accommodate him. And you\u2019d find it pretty easy to do.\n\nIn his mind, his rejection of pork is even more serious than a sensitivity because it\u2019s his soul, not just his body, at stake.\n\nI get that you think he\u2019s wrong and don\u2019t want to go out of your way at all to play into it, but I think your family will be happier if you just roll with his newfound but sincere beliefs. Freeze a bunch of grilled/baked chicken breasts & nuke one for him when you cook pork for the rest of the family. If you time it right, it will take no extra time and minimal effort.", "YTA. Big time. A major bigoted asshole. He is your son not a stranger staying with you. \nWhen we visit my parents for holidays and my mothers partner kids are there they accommodate everyone. \nMy husband is vegetarian (sometimes he is asked to buy his own alternative product because my mom doesn\u2019t know what is good or not) she always cooks it. \nMy moms partners daughter converted to Islam a few years ago. They get a no pork option (we are in germany, pork is the main meat dish). They also get alcohol free beer. As does my non-drinking husband. \n\nParental love should be unconditional no matter the age of the child. This post here with all the responses is horrible n", "ESH, you say you respect his decision, but when you were ordering pizza and everyone except him wanted pepperoni, you told him to buy himself what he wanted. I mean, if you were going to pay for pizza for everyone, why tell him to pay for wanted when he said he can't have pepperoni due to his religious beliefs? Would you have said the same if he wanted something else, but not for religious reasons? Unless what he wanted is significantly more expensive than pepperoni, you are being unfair to him. Other than that, he made the choice to convert to islam. He shouldn't expect you to cook for him a different meal just because he made that choice and he should start cooking for himself.", "YTA. Respect your child\u2019s religion and food choices, it\u2019s really not that hard and you literally do it for your daughter. You admit you\u2019re not happy he\u2019s Muslim now so clearly there\u2019s a bigger motive at play", "YTA- I mean the Pizza issue is so minor. You were ordering takeout not cooking. \nAll you had to do was order another pizza without pepperoni. \n\nI mean if he just wanted a non- pepperoni Pizza just because he disliked pepperoni or was a vegetarian etc would you still have been  an arse about it?\n\nCooking is another issue. If pork features heavily in your diet at home then it\u2019s unfair for him to insist on you cooking separate meals.\n\nSeems like you want to punish him for converting by making things at home difficult.", "Yta\nAs you stated you respect his decison... so why not respect his food restrictions. If not at least help him budget and teach him to buy his own food and cook it  hes 18 in your eyes an adult... so hopefully you taughy him the above mentioned responsibilities.\nAlso  it couldnt hurt to every once and a while cook for him or at least show him how to cook some of your homecooked meals without pork.\n\nRather than that talking to him about how he chose (it is his right) to convert to a religion with dietary restrictions your daughter is still under 18 and gets treated as a kid untill 18.\nThis is my judgment and suggestion. As perhaps he still very much enjoys your cooking styles but can not have pork.", "There\u2019s no AHs here. The question is just whether you want your son to feel disrespected and devalued in your home. Because even if you are \u201cright\u201d and NTA, buying a cheese pizza seems like a small price to pay to let your son know his wants and needs are important to you.", "NTA but if I were him I\u2019d probably stop coming around as often", "YTA. He\u2019s 18 and in college, where is he getting the money to buy pizza from? Cmon now, you\u2019re supposed to be family, you really can\u2019t accommodate his dietary restrictions? \n\nMy girlfriend is a vegetarian, am I supposed to not think of her choices when we\u2019re going out? If we get married and she decides to stay home, am I gonna tell her to find the money to buy a different pizza? Give me a break.", "NTA. If he respects his religion so much, why isn't he being more proactive about it? He should learn to cook his meals.", "Soft YTA. If you\u2019re riding pizza you should order him something he can eat. 18 doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t buy him food he\u2019s family. Now cooking an entirely different meal? Nah that\u2019s crazy.", "YTA and you know it! Just be honest you don\u2019t respect his religion! Own it! Oh and when you daughter turns 18 please keep that same energy and remind her and yourself that\u2019s she\u2019s an adult and no one else in the family has her condition so she should buy her own food going forward!", "YTA.\n\nSo... The majority of the people here thinks \"your choice, f**k you\". What could be a way to learn a different approach, to be more inclusive, to respect each other became a petty fight because \"he became Muslim\". Would it be the same if he became vegan? Would it be the same if he decided to be called as she/her?\n\nWhy this double-standard from the community?", "NTA- he\u2019s trying to force you to accommodate his religious choice. Your daughter has a medical issue, it\u2019s not her choice to be that way. Your son made a choice and he has to respect that you don\u2019t feel the same way he does about religion and he can\u2019t expect people to cater to him because of his own choices", "Yta. It is fine to have your son cook meals for himself if you are doing something he doesn't like,, but the fact that you were unwilling to get a half or quarter cheese three quarter pepperoni pizza makes me suspect that this is not just about inconvenience. If he came home from college as a vegetarian would you insist on only getting meat pizzas.", "As an adult he can make his own food. Her\u2019s is a restriction that you follow for her health. He\u2019s being ridiculous to expect this of you. Nta.", "YTA. Look, I get not wanting to get him a whole second meal, but you can't even get a cheese pizza for him when you're ordering in? C'mon, that's a bit far. Getting some of the pizza you ordered as plain cheese would not have cost you more in time or labour, when it comes to ordering pizza for a group the only reason not to accommodate food restrictions (even self-imposed ones) is to be an ass. You were going to get pizza for four if he was able to eat pork, this isn't a money thing. And you didn't make the meals, so it's not a time thing. What else could it be?", "Honestly yes YTA. Is it that hard for you to order him his own pizza when he\u2019s having dinner with you? It wouldn\u2019t have cost you that much, and would have been no effort at all for you to do this small thing to show him you accept him. But you couldn\u2019t even do that so he\u2019s probably right to think it\u2019s shitty you couldn\u2019t even do that.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to change everything to accommodate his diet but JFC you can order him an appropriate pizza", "Here\u2019s a question, when your daughter turns 18, are you going to stop making alternative meals for her? \n\nIf so, then NTA but still kinda weird because you refuse to be a good support network for your kids.\n\nIf you would continue making meals for her that are lactose free, then YTA (which is what I suspect would happen).", "Does he work? Or do you pay his bills while he is a student? Does he live at home or does he go back and forth between a dorm and home? If he still relies on you financially in other ways you apprive of, then YTA.\n\nIs he otherwise completely independent financially and just lives at home? If so, NTA.\n\nRegardless, it isn't  hard to request one pizza be half vegetarian or do replace one entry with something easy like. Frozen grilled chicken breast, etc", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m a vegetarian in my 40\u2019s and my mom still accommodates my meals when I come home for a visit. \n\nHow hard is it to have a side or two that your son can eat?  If my mom gets a pizza, she orders two. One with meat and one without. It\u2019s really not difficult.", "Info: Why are you making separate meals to your daughter and not just buying lactose free products?", "YTA", "YTA.  If part of your agreement is that you cook the meals when he's home, then it's reasonable to cook meals that meet all of the dietary guidelines.  A religious reason is as valid as a dietary reason.  Now, if the agreement was that he manage his own food, then fine.  But cooking for everyone in the family (including him) for most nights, but not making adjustments when it's a pork meal, then I'd say that's not cool.  And if cooking is too onerous (especially with the dietary requirements), then spread the load and make others responsible for meals on other nights.", "NTA because he's an adult. But I feel like making accommodating substitutions would be easy. Would it really affect the family diet much if you cooked/ordered chicken instead of pork?", "NTA at all. Your daughter doesn't have a choice. Not the same at all", "NTA\n\nA medical issue trumps a religious issue - he clearly doesn't understand that and needed to learn this lesson now before he starts throwing around even more entitled behaviour.", "ESH, except for your daughter.  No, you don\u2019t need to change what you cook, but you do need to DISCUSS your limits and boundaries with your son.  If ordering pizza for the family, why on earth wouldn\u2019t you get a small cheese pizza for him??????  That sounds like bigotry talking. \n\nYour son needs to discuss with you how he will go about adapting your meal, cooperating with you, and making his own protein for when you make stuff he can\u2019t have.  \n\nCommunication and cooperation is required from both of you.", "ESH. I grew up muslim but still don\u2019t eat pork. I don\u2019t expect people to accommodate my diet by ordering me something different or what not. A lot of people are kind enough to make something everyone, including myself, can enjoy. \n\nYour son shouldn\u2019t expect you to accommodate him, that\u2019s just not how it works. However, you\u2019re not communicating with him properly and that\u2019s where you become the AH. First, you\u2019re making your daughter separate food, then you make him his own food but then stop without even a conversation of why you\u2019re stopping. Yes he\u2019s an adult but he\u2019s also only 18. Of course he thinks you\u2019re picking favorites or \u201cpunishing\u201d him for reverting. \n\nAlso, did you have a conversation with him about converting? Maybe I\u2019ll get downvoted for this but I\u2019m suspicious of kids who go to college and convert to Islam.\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to add that you also shouldn\u2019t be pushing away your kid right now. This might be a controversial thing but converts are usually more vulnerable to extremist groups. They usually feel a lack of community because they don\u2019t really connect with those that were born muslim, and their previous community (like family) typically reject them after converting, so the extremist groups eat them up.", "YTA for the way you worded this, \u201cI might not agree\u201d. Why do you care if he converted to Islam?", "YTA - It\u2019s the polite thing to do to at least make an effort to accommodate a family member or friend\u2019s dietary restriction, especially if he\u2019s your son! So long as it\u2019s a dietary restriction (i.e. not just being a picky eater), it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for health reasons, religious reasons, or other reasons (ex. being vegetarian). \n\nTakeout shouldn\u2019t be that hard to accommodate. With the pizza example, you could do half pepperoni and half cheese (or another topping). Or you could order a small cheese pizza on the side. It might be a little more expensive, but you were already planning on ordering enough food for the entire \n\nWith the cooking example, it depends on what you\u2019re making. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to make an entirely different and separate entree for him, but I think making at least some effort to accommodate goes a long way. If the dish contains pork (ex. pork fried rice), you could set aside a portion of fried rice without pork before adding it. If the main entree is pork, you could double check with your son to make sure the sides are enough for a sufficient meal. \n\nSince your son is going to college, this is also an opportunity for you to cook and prepare meals together. You can involve him in the process rather than just leaving him to fend for himself.", "He\u2019s an adult he really can prepare his own meals ? I am allergic to most foods unfortunately.

Both your children are capable of cooking, given their age. Also, you don't mention a partner, but if you have one, then maybe they need to also take part of this. Have a day a week for each to cook always accommodating the rest of the family members' restrictions. it will create sensitivity for the others' needs and yours and all of your family, especially your children, will benefit from learning more about cooking and food.

It wouldn\u2019t be fair for her to cook two meals. I turned out to be an amazing self sufficient cook in the process. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to you either. Your son made a choice as well. The expectation of making an 18 year old his own meal is slightly meh. Respect his decision but guy can cook his own food the way anyone else can if he doesn\u2019t want to eat what you prepared. Maybe come up with compromises and meal plans with him being home for the summer. Get him involved in the cooking with you and bring your daughter along as well.

Agree that medical condition is different from religious/ethical choice. IMHO, that's not the most important factor here, though.\n\n2.

While I don't believe you are *obligated* to never have pork while he's around, I also don't see how it would hurt to make some accommodations. For example, if you were planning to have brats for dinner, you might choose to make hamburgers instead of (or in addition to) brats. Or maybe instead of a pork roast you could sometimes have a beef pot roast. Whatever specific food choices aren't as important as the gesture that you recognize his autonomy and care about his feelings and want him to feel loved and welcome in your home. \n\n4. You might ask him to participate in meal planning and grocery shopping. That way, he can plan ahead for pepperoni pizza night if needed. Again, for me that's not about his religious freedom or your obligation - it's about having a supportive, respectful relationship with your newly-adult son.

My family eats pork often and my son knows this. Every time something pork is on the menu, he\u2019s expected me to make him an alternative meal. I admit the first few days I did make him alternative meals but I can\u2019t keep doing that every time because he made a decision. Yesterday we ordered pizza for dinner, the rest of the family wanted pepperoni. My son expected me to order him a separate cheese pizza. I told him if he wanted it he had to buy it himself. Then he basically threw a whole tantrum saying I don\u2019t respect his religion. Then he went on to say I\u2019m being unfair and I have double standards because I make his sister alternative food but not him.

It sucks, I'm sure he feels hurt, but at that point if he's demanding special treatment for something he decided on, that's on him. He can step into the kitchen then. \n\nI was pretty much raised as, whatever the parents are making, you either eat it or you make something else yourself.", "I will acknowledge that. But, this guy doesn't have health issues like his sister does. So that doesn't matter when it comes to him. He can make his own plates then. They also have cheap crusts and things, you can even make some really good home made pizzas. He may not like making his own food, but it would be a good time to start learning to prep his own religion friendly meals, as eventually he will be out on his own anyhow.", "That is a fair point, but then he can make his own pizza or order his own.", ">everyone else\n\nIt\u2019s his family. The whole point of family is you accept and love each other. There should be a compromise here besides \u201cI\u2019ll make you a separate meal\u201d and \u201cfigure it out yourself\u201d", "It must suck to be one of your family members.", "Didn\u2019t realize this was a debate on the validity of religion. Yea, you have no bearing on my comment then. Thanks for trying.", "Be that as it may, why aren't everyone else expected to pay", "Just wondering, ever consider lactase pills? Some of my lactose intolerant friends say they work wonders", "Hives must be a milk allergy and not lactose intolerance, right?", "Whatever works for you.\n\nI went through a similar period around 2017 where I lost 20+ pounds because I restricted my diet so much as I could not figure out what was causing all my issues.", "Many aged hard cheeses, actually contain little lactose making them safer to eat. Not completely safe but better than fresh cheeses like mozzarella. Fontina cheese is one of my favorites of the aged variety.", "Unless you\u2019re also literally a doctor maybe you shouldn\u2019t be giving people medical advice about their own personal health experiences? Just a thought", "My parents didn't teach me either, but I didn't sit around being helpless. I used Google and followed recipes once I moved out for college (at 18)", "That\u2019s a bit of a jump. I mean it\u2019s possible, but still a big jump.", "Chicken is way more expensive than pork though. It can be more than twice as much. It's possible their diet consists heavily of pork because of a budget.", "It\u2019s more \u201cwould they be making separate meals for him if he wasn\u2019t Muslim\u201d", "If you're old enough to make a life-changing choice like, say, converting to an unspecified religion, then you should be old enough to provide yourself with food.", "The family dynamic is, and is in actually a lot of families.\n\nThere's a meal, if you don't like it then that's on you.\n\nI grew up with it and many I know grew up with it.\n\nThe family Might not be able to AFFORD to get other meals.\n\nHe's an full ass adult who they're clothing, sheltering, and feeding.\n\nIf he doesn't like or want that food that's on him.", "Ok but she wasn\u2019t making it, that\u2019s the entire point. She didn\u2019t make the pizza. Getting half and half wouldn\u2019t cost more. Getting pepperoni on the side wouldn\u2019t cost more. It\u2019s her son, not some random stranger off the street. \n\nI simply cannot imagine my daughter coming home and telling me she was Muslim, or Jewish, or vegan and telling her to kick rocks because I just don\u2019t feel like telling the guy on the phone to put some shit on the side.", "New converts are very fanatical about their new sky daddy. So he is testing ground before adding more demands.", "Yes it must. Esp if each member of the family decided to convert into a new religion and expected me to make 5 different breakfast, lunch and dinner catering to each person's religious dietary needs. Pork free, beef free, vegan, garlic free, onion free etc etc.", "Ofc it is. That's what OPs issue is based on.", "they are children and one has a medical issue. while they respect his religion, this was his choice and they are not obligated to pay for his food.", "At this point we are past \u201cmaking separate meals\u201d and in the territory of \u201cletting him use the groceries to cook his own meals\u201d. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the mother can\u2019t be compelled to cook for him.", "Oh so we are in the business of punishing kids for undesirable choices here, I see. That was my point about mothers behavior from the beginning.", "If that's all the family eats, then it's the majority vote. I don't always luck out, if I don't like what's being made then I just do it myself. This isn't a huge issue. Unfair? Maybe, but he'll get over it. at first OP tried to accommodate things, but it is a lot to try and get everyone situated. Maybe the son should also pitch in on cooking his own meals.", "Look, I\u2019m not religious. The only thing I\u2019ve ever converted was FROM Catholicism, and now I have a strong dislike for all organized religion. My point here is that family is supposed to meet in the middle. OP should not be cooking the kid separate meals, but getting a half and half pizza is the type of compromise you\u2019d make for a guest coming to your house. It\u2019s not above and beyond by any means.", "If she is actually intolerant of a religion and refuses to accommodate, then she is very obviously an AH, as are you. It\u2019s good though, this sub should have a diverse range of smart and dumb people. Good talking to you", "It\u2019s less than you\u2019d do for a guest eating a meal at your house! I cannot imagine ordering something for everyone in the house besides one individual. I\u2019m sorry that your family did that to you, that\u2019s fucked up.", "Religion that is inherently intolerant should not be tolerated. Thr Paradox of Tolerance does not just apply to ideologies.", "You are too dumb to have this level of discussion on religion. Good luck edge lord", "Cute"]}
