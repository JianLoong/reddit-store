{"id": 20220, "submission_id": "14f03ai", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into. \n\nHer apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though. \n\nMy girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet. \n\nI would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important.\n\nMy office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over. \n\nMy girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner. \n\nI love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?", "created_utc": 1687330374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f03ai/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_her_home_decor_is/", "score": 884, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re stuffy and boring and have no sense of whimsy. \n\nWhy do people have to give up the stuff they enjoy just because they reach an arbitrary age that makes them an adult?

Say that your collegeaus are a bit pretentions and close-minded, and you don't think they would react positively to decor that's outside of their norm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Insult her taste and her.\n\n? If this was really just about your collegeaus, you would have gone with the first option. But it's not, is it? The way you talked to her and the way you have written about it show that. The fact of the matter is that *you* don't like her decor and you saw this as an opportunity to show your true opinions about it, by insulting her decor and insulting her.", "YTA. Your girlfriend sounds cool.", "YTA. So you don't like her interests. You don't have to be judgemental about it. Your one and only experience bringing someone over they were \"terrified\" of the insect display. So this one person and your own distaste has convinced you that everyone would be terrified??\n\nYou don't need to bring your work colleagues over, but if you yourself look down on your gf because of her interests and how she chooses to decorate, maybe you shouldn't be with her.", "Yeah, you don't really love her. If you did, you would rejoice in these FANTASTIC examples of her quirkiness. She sounds *great*. \n\nYTA because you're pretending to love this woman but you secretly look down on her and feel superior. \n\nBreak up with her and let her find someone who will cherish her awesomeness.", "YTA. Brooo. If you want a plain Jane, just break up with her already and save her the trouble. Sounds like you already disliked her decor and when some few people agreed with you, you think you're in the right.\n And When you mentioned her career/salary it sounds like because she does so well, you think she should act a certain way. Cause there's no way a successful adult has such \"childish\" interests or decorum. \nIt's literally her *own* apartment like you said. Like she is right, you don't have a say nor opinion. Hopefully she breaks up with you cause you sound like an unsupportive partner. Like yeah couple's can have different interests, but once you start telling the other partner they shouldn't enjoy or collect their interests/hobbies, that's crossing a line.", "YTA  and a snob\n\n>my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.\n\nYour mother is disgusting, how dare she weaponize autism and use it as an insult.\n\nYou and your mother are deplorable", "YTA.

That\u2019s what you sound like, and it\u2019s completely arbitrary.\n\nThe fact is, she\u2019s not a child. She is a grown woman, and that is *her* place.

Side note is your GF looking for new friends? She sounds hella cool.", "YTA\n\nWhat exactly is childish about tarantulas? Or anglerfish? I\u2019m not sure you actually know what the word childish means, you\u2019re just using it as a catch all to try and put your girlfriend down.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty shitty of you to put down her interests as childish just because you don\u2019t share them. Fine, you don\u2019t want to host at her apartment. But to say that a grown woman shouldn\u2019t decorate how she wants in her own home is ridiculous. \n\nI\u2019d argue you\u2019re the one who needs to grow up. Who cares how she decorates? Just because it\u2019s not the standard crate & barrel home decor doesn\u2019t make it wrong. You seem very preoccupied with other peoples perceptions. And like you\u2019ve surrounded yourself with equally judgy people. I\u2019d love it if I went to a party and the hosts had their interests displayed like that! If nothing else it\u2019s a guaranteed conversation starter. \n\nYou\u2019ve insulted your girlfriend, her interests, and her taste. I have to wonder why she\u2019s still with you. \n\nAlso, your mom is incredibly TA for asking if she\u2019s autistic just because she has slightly unusual home decor. What the fuck? Just because someone isn\u2019t exactly the same as you doesn\u2019t make them neurodivergent. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with being autistic, but from the way you wrote it it does sound like your mom meant it in a derogatory way. Not cool. You should\u2019ve shut that down immediately and told your mom off for saying that", "YTA, her decor sounds cool to me and I'm in my 40s. So relax Frances.", "YTA so you insult your gfs taste and you just expect her to accept that without any consequences in your relationship", "YTA, shallow and just plain horrible. Truthfully I think you\u2019d gf would be better off being your ex gf. \nAlso you clearly don\u2019t know much about children or the things she is interested in.", "YTA and it really sounds like you don't respect your girlfriend. Calling her decor/interests childish/strange/not normal means you're insulting her and disparaging her character as a person.\n\nShe's not childish if she's got different interests than you or whatever you define as normal; you're just embarrassed she's not fitting into the very narrow and frankly boring idea of what a grown adult should be interested in.\n\nSince she's apparently able to work at a high salary job and afford a very nice place in a fancy hi-rise and decorate with expensive or unusual items, it sounds like she's a fully functional and capable adult.\n\nYou definitely sound like you don't appreciate her creativity/uniqueness and she deserves better from a partner. It would be a good thing for you to break up and pursue a nice *normal* adult partner that is into hobbies and decorating with things like a stamp collecting or spoons of the world and other generic crud so they don't embarrass you so much.", "YTA. If she had decorated her apartment with swastikas and KKK memorabilia, you would have a point, but her decor is not harmful or offensive to anybody.", "YTA. Your girlfriend deserves someone who is proud of her and her awesome apartment. Seriously, that place sounds phenomenal and I want to hang out with your girlfriend. But do you? From the way you talk in your post, it doesn't even sound as if you like her. Why date someone you want to keep hidden from everyone else around you? What if your relationship miraculously progresses after you were so dismissive of her interests, and you two want to live together? Are you going to try force her to give up all of her awesome decor and personal style to suit your bland tastes? If you aren't willing to accept her generous offer to host and defend her style choices if your coworkers are rude, then do her a favor and just leave her so she can find someone who appreciates who she really is, not who you seem to be hoping you can turn her into.", "YTA but also I get it and I think you already realize. \n\nYou work in finance. People are judgmental. These are your colleagues, not your friends. You're making the right call by not bringing them over if all they're going to do is snicker behind her back and be generally lame and uncool about it. Your girlfriend seems like a wonderful, open, happy human. She doesn't need that energy in her apartment. \n\nObviously, hearing that you think her decor is strange is going to hurt her feelings.

You, your mom, and your coworkers are all boring people worried about pearl clutchy appearances rather than seeing something or meeting someone interesting.

By all means don't host, but you didn't have to insult her to explain it to her. \n\nAs for your girlfriend, your description of her apartment has given me some lovely ideas for when me and my husband move again and we have space for a laboratory for me in the new house.", "Oh but his mother thought the girlfriend was autistic //s \ud83d\ude44.", "YTA, you don\u2019t think she\u2019s stupid, just everything she likes? \n\nShe sounds amazing.

Also, YTA because of the way you phrased it to your gf, implying that she's not acting as a grown adult. If your main problem here is what your coworkers will think about it, what you should have told her was \"my coworkers can't appreciate your sense of decor and I don't think it's fair for you to have to deal with that sort of bs so I rather not have them here\". This would have not been condescending and invalidating to her, and would actually show what the real problem is.
