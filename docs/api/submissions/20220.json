{"id": 20220, "submission_id": "14f03ai", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into. \n\nHer apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though. \n\nMy girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet. \n\nI would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important.\n\nMy office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over. \n\nMy girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner. \n\nI love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?", "created_utc": 1687330374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f03ai/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_her_home_decor_is/", "score": 8666, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's fine if you think her apartment's ambience isn't appropriate for a work event, but YTA for dating someone you don't actually like and then expecting them to dull who they are so your coworkers don't get the vapors. Yeah, I know you say you like her, and I'm sure you like her appearance and her money and her high-status building, but you clearly have nothing but disdain for her personality and interests. She doesn't have to beige herself down to satisfy your weird obsession with appearing \"adult\".", "I hate people who gatekeep adulthood. They\u2019re stuffy and boring and have no sense of whimsy. \n\nWhy do people have to give up the stuff they enjoy just because they reach an arbitrary age that makes them an adult? That\u2019s bullshit. Love what you love and celebrate it until the day you die!\n\nAnd the triangle dude is almost certainly Bill Cipher.", "YTA - Let's say for a second that her decor could actually cause problem in your work (which I very highly doubt), there are 2 ways to go about it: \n\n1. Say that your collegeaus are a bit pretentions and close-minded, and you don't think they would react positively to decor that's outside of their norm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Insult her taste and her.\n\n? If this was really just about your collegeaus, you would have gone with the first option. But it's not, is it? The way you talked to her and the way you have written about it show that. The fact of the matter is that *you* don't like her decor and you saw this as an opportunity to show your true opinions about it, by insulting her decor and insulting her.", "YTA. Your girlfriend sounds cool.", "YTA. So you don't like her interests. You don't have to be judgemental about it. Your one and only experience bringing someone over they were \"terrified\" of the insect display. So this one person and your own distaste has convinced you that everyone would be terrified??\n\nYou don't need to bring your work colleagues over, but if you yourself look down on your gf because of her interests and how she chooses to decorate, maybe you shouldn't be with her.", "Yeah, you don't really love her. If you did, you would rejoice in these FANTASTIC examples of her quirkiness. She sounds *great*. \n\nYTA because you're pretending to love this woman but you secretly look down on her and feel superior. \n\nBreak up with her and let her find someone who will cherish her awesomeness.", "YTA. Brooo. If you want a plain Jane, just break up with her already and save her the trouble. Sounds like you already disliked her decor and when some few people agreed with you, you think you're in the right.\n And When you mentioned her career/salary it sounds like because she does so well, you think she should act a certain way. Cause there's no way a successful adult has such \"childish\" interests or decorum. \nIt's literally her *own* apartment like you said. Like she is right, you don't have a say nor opinion. Hopefully she breaks up with you cause you sound like an unsupportive partner. Like yeah couple's can have different interests, but once you start telling the other partner they shouldn't enjoy or collect their interests/hobbies, that's crossing a line.", "[removed]", "YTA. Your girlfriend sounds rad. If I walked into a coworkers house like that my respect level for them would go WAY up. Just let people be interested in things", "YTA- also I won\u2019t lie to you, I exclaimed \u201cawesome\u201d when I read about the cartoon wall of futurama and presumably gravity falls and then again about the bugs- you do realise these are her interests? If you don\u2019t like them/ her home decor are you sure this relationship will work in the long run?", "YTA for insulting her really, why wouldn\u2019t you decorate your home with things you love? That\u2019s one of the best things about having your own place, that you can put whatever you want in it. \n\nBesides, isn\u2019t it a little *juvenile* to bring your classmates from school to your house for snackies and juice? That\u2019s what you sound like, and it\u2019s completely arbitrary.\n\nThe fact is, she\u2019s not a child. She is a grown woman, and that is *her* place. You are the one that needs to grow up.", "[removed]", "YTA for so many reasons. Side note is your GF looking for new friends? She sounds hella cool.", "YTA\n\nWhat exactly is childish about tarantulas? Or anglerfish? I\u2019m not sure you actually know what the word childish means, you\u2019re just using it as a catch all to try and put your girlfriend down.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty shitty of you to put down her interests as childish just because you don\u2019t share them. Fine, you don\u2019t want to host at her apartment. But to say that a grown woman shouldn\u2019t decorate how she wants in her own home is ridiculous. \n\nI\u2019d argue you\u2019re the one who needs to grow up. Who cares how she decorates? Just because it\u2019s not the standard crate & barrel home decor doesn\u2019t make it wrong. You seem very preoccupied with other peoples perceptions. And like you\u2019ve surrounded yourself with equally judgy people. I\u2019d love it if I went to a party and the hosts had their interests displayed like that! If nothing else it\u2019s a guaranteed conversation starter. \n\nYou\u2019ve insulted your girlfriend, her interests, and her taste. I have to wonder why she\u2019s still with you. \n\nAlso, your mom is incredibly TA for asking if she\u2019s autistic just because she has slightly unusual home decor. What the fuck? Just because someone isn\u2019t exactly the same as you doesn\u2019t make them neurodivergent. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with being autistic, but from the way you wrote it it does sound like your mom meant it in a derogatory way. Not cool. You should\u2019ve shut that down immediately and told your mom off for saying that", "YTA, her decor sounds cool to me and I'm in my 40s. So relax Frances.", "YTA so you insult your gfs taste and you just expect her to accept that without any consequences in your relationship", "YTA, shallow and just plain horrible. Truthfully I think you\u2019d gf would be better off being your ex gf. \nAlso you clearly don\u2019t know much about children or the things she is interested in.", "YTA and it really sounds like you don't respect your girlfriend. Calling her decor/interests childish/strange/not normal means you're insulting her and disparaging her character as a person.\n\nShe's not childish if she's got different interests than you or whatever you define as normal; you're just embarrassed she's not fitting into the very narrow and frankly boring idea of what a grown adult should be interested in.\n\nSince she's apparently able to work at a high salary job and afford a very nice place in a fancy hi-rise and decorate with expensive or unusual items, it sounds like she's a fully functional and capable adult.\n\nYou definitely sound like you don't appreciate her creativity/uniqueness and she deserves better from a partner. It would be a good thing for you to break up and pursue a nice *normal* adult partner that is into hobbies and decorating with things like a stamp collecting or spoons of the world and other generic crud so they don't embarrass you so much.", "YTA. If she had decorated her apartment with swastikas and KKK memorabilia, you would have a point, but her decor is not harmful or offensive to anybody.", "YTA. Your girlfriend deserves someone who is proud of her and her awesome apartment. Seriously, that place sounds phenomenal and I want to hang out with your girlfriend. But do you? From the way you talk in your post, it doesn't even sound as if you like her. Why date someone you want to keep hidden from everyone else around you? What if your relationship miraculously progresses after you were so dismissive of her interests, and you two want to live together? Are you going to try force her to give up all of her awesome decor and personal style to suit your bland tastes? If you aren't willing to accept her generous offer to host and defend her style choices if your coworkers are rude, then do her a favor and just leave her so she can find someone who appreciates who she really is, not who you seem to be hoping you can turn her into.", "YTA but also I get it and I think you already realize. \n\nYou work in finance. People are judgmental. These are your colleagues, not your friends. You're making the right call by not bringing them over if all they're going to do is snicker behind her back and be generally lame and uncool about it. Your girlfriend seems like a wonderful, open, happy human. She doesn't need that energy in her apartment. \n\nObviously, hearing that you think her decor is strange is going to hurt her feelings. And that's why YTA. But at the end of the day as long as you don't ask her to change and can accept & love her for who she is, quirky apartment and all, you're fine.", "YTA\n\nNot for not wanting to host there. But for your disdain of your gf's interests. The whole tone in the post, your gf could do way better. She deserves better. I hope she soon realizes that.\n\nEdited.", "YTA and probably the most boring person to walk the earth. Please show your GF this post so she can move on to someone who actually appreciates and shares her interests.

You sound like a white collar snore.", "INFO: can I have your girlfriends number", "YTA. You know the problem? You, your mom, and your coworkers are all boring people worried about pearl clutchy appearances rather than seeing something or meeting someone interesting. My soul hurts for people like you and yours; it just seems like such a waste of such limited time we have to live. By all means don't host, but you didn't have to insult her to explain it to her. \n\nAs for your girlfriend, your description of her apartment has given me some lovely ideas for when me and my husband move again and we have space for a laboratory for me in the new house.", "Oh but his mother thought the girlfriend was autistic //s \ud83d\ude44.", "YTA, you don\u2019t think she\u2019s stupid, just everything she likes? \n\nShe sounds amazing.

She is under no obligation to give up her hobbies, passions, and \u201cfirst loves\u201d for you. \nI\u2019m sure the reason you\u2019re still together is you hope to change her.

He often took me to the field he owned (our 2nd garden where we planted crops) and on the way there were lots of poppy flowers.

Also, YTA because of the way you phrased it to your gf, implying that she's not acting as a grown adult. If your main problem here is what your coworkers will think about it, what you should have told her was \"my coworkers can't appreciate your sense of decor and I don't think it's fair for you to have to deal with that sort of bs so I rather not have them here\". This would have not been condescending and invalidating to her, and would actually show what the real problem is.

Whether you want to present as a fully OTT Elegant Gothic Lolita or a Confident Business Adult or Suburban Parent Who Wants To Fit In With Other Parents At The Playground, it's all a costume that you build according to the arbitrary \"rules\" set by the group you want to fit in with. The same applies for your house, you are setting a stage. Maybe you want your stage to be elegant and tasteful and following the unspoken neurotypical guidelines. Maybe you want to be Morticia Addams' frumpier, SAHM friend living in a hodgepodge of cottagecore-goth decor you made yourself from YouTube tutorials (looking at you, PricklyAlpaca and your mushroom lamp amd mirror, and Racheal Maksy and your.....whole fucking amazing house). \n\nI think it upsets some people because it makes them realize on a subconscious level that they've been programmed to censor themselves and edit their true selves to conform to this set of rules and they resent those of us who don't \"give up\" those parts of themselves.", "Oh that would be an awesome centerpiece! \n\nOne of my friends is a Florist, but her favorite side hobby is dead/dried flowers. She uses interesting sticks, but I bet Antlers would look so cool too!", "YTAH.\n\nNot even halfway through - and this woman sounds like a perfect woman.\n\n> Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects.\n\n* Like WHAT THE FUCK, YES PLEASE. I would do nigh anything for a woman like this.\n\n> But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet\n\n* YES PLEASEEEEEE. Get me someone who can get these kinds of things - that sounds fucking *cool*. this girl has the kind of personality I would want to know.\n\n> just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting\n\n* Not off putting. Maybe for you - but all of those are conversation starters. Your girlfriend would absolutely wreck house with interesting conversation pieces. Does she also collect facts on the different creatures? \n\n> My office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over.\n\n* In other words - you care more about *how your co-workers think of you* than you do for your GF.\n\nLet me reiterate something:\n\n> She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and **not something a grown woman would have**\n\n* That shit is **sexist as fuck**. People have unique interests - you gf has some interests too. The fact she finds *you* interesting, is a blessing to you. She doesn't *need* you to make her happy. Who the fuck are you to tell her that her interests are childish?\n\n> My girlfriend got mad and said **at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy**. She also said that **she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner.**\n\n* Damn fucking straight. She can decorate her place however she likes. The fact you can't deal with it - isn't her problem. That is *yours*. *You* are the one who is insecure about the items - *you* are the one who thinks it is childish. She is an adult - who spends her money as she wishes, on things she likes, and things that bring her joy. And you are *lucky* she considered you as bringing her joy - though that may now be in question.\n\n> But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? \n\n* Yes? You ever hear of a 'man cave'? Where the person just takes a room in their house and overloads it with sports stuff? Judging on this - you find that childish too\n\n * Let me ask you something - how fucking *plain* is your home? Beige carpets and walls, with nothing on it but some pictures? Most people surround themselves with things that bring them happiness - like your gf has. My old man has football stuff all over his little room, my mom has art on different walls, of ships and sail boats throughout the home. *I* have some posters framed from some of my favorite video games like Halo. *Does all of this make us childish?*\n\n> I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.\n\n* ... Maybe your GF would be better of with someone that supports her interests, than someone who looks down on her, and allows their mom to imply she has mental issues.\n\n\nEdit: GF, if you are reading this, feel free to reach out with a PM!

I just worry that people with Arachnophobia may have trouble.\"\n\nThat'd have been the adult thing to say from you.\n\nHer home sounds awsome and adults are allowed to decorate their homes how they like, it's not like she has lamps made of human skin or something.\n\nGrow up dude.", "People on the business industry are very reliant on trust and reputation. It's also a very competitive place where everyone is trying to find chances to lower others on their coworker's eyes. I can certainly see people finding the place an excuse to call him weird and childish by proxy because of his choice of partner. Plus, these people tend to be relentless so I doubt his girlfriend is gonna have much fun either unless she has incredibly thick skin and doesn't care about people's reactions. People's mistake here is thinking op is an outlier and not the majority on that industry. Most people there are stuck up and very pretentious.\n\n\n\nBut, even tho I don't think the op is an asshole, I do think they should rethink their relationship considering I can't see it working out in the long-run without op somehow getting into nerdiness or girlfriend eventually having her passion's repressed, because it's obviously not just a workplace thing.", "Yup I agree with this. OP isn't an asshole for not wanting to host his work function there, but he is an asshole for the judgemental tone of this post and how he conveyed his feelings to his girlfriend.", "Im 33 and just recently living alone with no roommate or girlfriend for the first time in my life, and I have framed Misfits and Alkaline Trio posters in my living room and a big ass socialist flag. I decided I don't care if I appear childish cause I kinda am childish", "That was such a weird thing to add to the post honestly and has truly nothing to do with OPs \u201cproblem\u201d, it\u2019s just rude.\n\nAm I autistic and have what OP would consider \u201cweird\u201d decor? Yeah. But does every autistic person have \u201cweird\u201d decor? No. I\u2019ve been to plenty of NT folks home with \u201cweird\u201d decor, it\u2019s just fun to express oneself in their OWN environment where THEY live.", "I, at my big age, make dollhouses. Not to play, that's what my niece is for. But i enjoy creating them. My boyfriend supports me fully and has even helped me put together little wooden furniture kits. For Valentines Day, instead of real flowers, I mentioned lego flowers were a thing, and sure enough he got me some. Our apartment? Decorated to my style, not necessarily his. He supports my crafts, even if it isn't something that would interest him. I hope OPs girlfriend knows these men exist, too.", "Agreed, the fact that he brought up his mother wondering if she is autistic kind of just seals the coffin on this. Incredibly abelist. I'll never understand why bland men who have domineering personalities start dating whole ass people with an actual fully formed range of interests, and then try and change them, into being more \"adult\". \nIf the shit someone puts on their walls can so easily spook you, I think we know who really needs to grow up.", "He's not just a run-of-the-mill asshole; he's a shallow, *boring* asshole.", "OP sounds like he fawns over his colleagues' subtle off-white colored, tastefully thick, and  watermarked business card.", "Yes.

Houses like this are amazing to host gatherings in because of how unique they are.\n\nI thought OP was going to describe a pink-frilly childlike doll-like theme or something. Instead it\u2019s actually something cool", "My husband has bought me preserved butterflies to add to my collection! OP is an AH.", "This is the most important point, it's hard to admit but some people just don't mesh well, and that's okay. No one should give up on things they like to fit in to a certain \"preference\" or \"idea\"   \n\n\nPlus y'all should stop dating quirky girls if you can't take their quirkyness", "She sounds cool af frankly you can send her my number on the way out", "Honestly, my biggest red flag \ud83d\udea9 for this entire post (and the OP) in general is when they say they work in \u201cFinance\u201d. \n\nSounds like another uncultured insecure finance leech. \n\nSpeaking of leeches his GF has an awesome bug collection and should dump this chud.", "\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "I wish I could be your friend!

Or a collection of model cars. Because that's acceptable to his coworkers, guaranteed. It's not the odd taste in decor. If he had those things in his apartment, I bet you 20 Zoidbergs nothing would have been said. This is about a woman having cool interests and OP is being pressured by his co-workers into misogyny.", "Dude, if I had that kind of available income, I'd buy the Lego models of the Millennium Falcon, Death Star, Battlestar Galactica, Serenity and Nostromo, and a few other collectibles.", "I was thinking triangle man from They Might Be Giants.", "Funny enough, I saw a Gravity Falls journal for sale of Amazon and I was so tempted to buy it lol! It's been in my wish list for years lol. I also love Futurama (even watched it last night) but I wouldn't exactly use anything as decor.....although I have been known to use Fry's image as GIFs and Memes.", "Haha - I was obsessing about this a little - and yes, Bill was who I came up with too.", "Yup. He doesn\u2019t like her, and most importantly, OP doesn\u2019t know himself. He needs to rely on the opinions of others to form his own, half-baked opinion.

OP\u2019s girlfriend sounds cool as hell. OP sounds like a tool. I used to have a back bathroom decorated with oddities, and it was definitely not on every tour for every guest, so I *sort of* understand the coworker thing and that\u2019s actually just borderline to me.

She knows me so well.", "Same! And the only thing my husband ever asks me when I bring home some new thing from the oddities shop is \"Does this thing have weird vibes?\" (He had some concerns about the mounted roe deer skull I put on the wall under our wedding portrait, lol.) I'm always like \"nah,\" and he just shrugs and is like \"okay, then.\"\n\nFor my birthday a few years ago he bought me a big print of a painting I'd fallen in love with at an art show. The original was $12,000 so, you know, a bit out of my budget. But the print is good enough for me. It's a post-apocalyptic painting featuring several mutant hairless cats hanging out amongst the ruins of the Lincoln Memorial. It now hangs above our television lmao.", "Absolutely.  The fact that he misses this fact tells me she needs a new man.", "My husband got me my first venus flytrap years ago because \"you just don't seem like a flowers kind of person,\" haha. \n\nAlso, look.
