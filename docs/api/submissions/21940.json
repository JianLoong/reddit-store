The right thing to do would be to pay OP to have their portion of the fence moved to the shared property line so no one loses property. OR the non-cooperative neighbor has to build their portion of the fence inside their own property just like OP had to, which means there will be two fences within a few inches/feet of each other and dead space between.

The old fence along the back of my property was on the property line, blew down in a storm, and because the neighbor I share that property line with is an elderly visually impaired widower, I just paid for the whole thing and didn\u2019t ask him to contribute. Then a few months later, my neighbor on the side knocks on my door to ask if I want to contribute to the replacement of \u201cthe fence we share\u201d.  Well, I really didn\u2019t, because a.) I had just paid quite a lot to replace a long span of fence, didn\u2019t really have it I. The budget to take on another big expense like that again so soon. b.) when the person who owned the house before this guy had last replaced that fence (not that long ago), he didn\u2019t ask me to contribute, and he decided to extend the fence forward several yards, and had also raised the height of it (actually a foot higher than the HOA allows).  I didn\u2019t love the fact that he extended the fence, it makes the area by our driveway feel a little closed in, but I didn\u2019t make a stink with him, and I alsodidn\u2019t report the unauthorized height to the HOA. But the greater height and length make the replacement of the makes replacing the fence a lot more expensive. C.) according to my lot survey, my lot ends at the edge of my driveway, and the fence in question is about 6 inches away from the edge of the the driveway, so legally not my responsibility. \n\nI was a coward and dodged him during the fence construction. Now it\u2019s been several months and we\u2019ve exchanged a few niceties and the fence hasn\u2019t come up, so I guess my cowardice paid off."]}
