Op said in a response that their fence is within their property, not on the neighbors at all.", "So in your perspective I should have allowed them to permanently affix their structure to our preexisting fence without so much as letting us know in advance?

Does that mean where there are two fences, there is like 6 inches of dead space between them? Why would you not just share the cost and stick the fence straight on the party line.", "NTA....Ive had friends who've gone through this...Some were smart enough to send notarized letter to the neighbor stating no thats not ok...other didnt and occasionally its turned into a shit show...", "I just put in a 150 ft fence.  Cost me about 4k. Paid 100% myself.  I found the property markers and checked the survey.  I talked to both neighbors and they are fine with it, but you never know who'll own next year.  I made sure the fence was about 6 inches inside my property.   Both sides of the fence are on my property, so I figure neighbors have zero say.

In the UK, generally, one of the boundaries is yours specifically to replace. You know, because you get the \"bad side\" of the fence and your neighbours would get the \"good side.\" Most people consult their neighbours and some share costs, but its not expected.

Ive heard horror stories of shared fences with dick neighbours. One in particular was a guy whose neighbour installed something so the water from the eavestrough drained into their yard. They tried moving it, neighbours put it back, they asked them to please redirect it they said no. It's flooding the guys basement or something because of how close it is to the house. They get the authorities involved and are basically told because the fence in the shared property line the asshole neighbour is technically allowed to do that. Moral of the story have your own fence so you know it's yours and noone else's.", "When my parents were looking at putting up a fence they found that they could not put it on the property line unless the other neighbors agreed to it as a property fence.

They weren\u2019t super happy with our color choice but it wasn\u2019t really our decision in the first place. Builder put in beige vinyl all along the back lines of the property so we matched that. Thought having two different colors would look bad. From the husbands text to me later yesterday he feels like they were \u201cforced\u201d into the color. They have every right to put a different color fence in on their property if they like.

And you're right, I think there was more of this when I was a kid in the 90s.  The homes and townhouses where I live now were built in the early 2000s and (thankfully) don't share anymore.", "Just be neighborly about it instead of being petty. Goodness.", "Doesn\u2019t make it not petty. You get that right? You can be right AND petty.", "It seems your biggest hang up is them not letting you know. I get that. They are still your neigbor and you could have acted more graciously. I def would\u2019ve talked to them and said \u201chey, just checking in. It looks like you plan to attach your fence to my post. It\u2019s not a big deal but I would have appreciated a heads up\u201d.", "They didn't read or they are just as entitled as your neighbors . Ignore it. \n\nYou are doing the right thing for multiple reasons one of them being if you need or want to replace your fence in the future you would be obligated to pay the neighbors or replace their part too if you allow them to attach it to your posts. NTA at all.\n\n I'm also sure they wanted to do this to save money but that's not your concern either", "How can you leech a post? So OP wants 2 posts right next to each other? Looks dumb.", "If the neighbor were trying to do that, wouldn't that make the neighbor an AH?"]}
