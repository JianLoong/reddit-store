Imagine if you'd gone anyway as her mother is saying, and she'd made a scene or had you thrown out...\n\nAny option other than acquiescing to the bride would have been wrong. So - NTA.", "And it\u2019s not like OP didn\u2019t try exhaust every resource to try to find last-minute childcare. Missing a loved one\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t fun but she respected the bride\u2019s wishes so she\u2019s NTA.", "I also don\u2019t know how last minute they got the venue sorted but children or not less than a month of notice is nowhere near enough time for almost anyone. Some people have to travel and others need time off from work (especially for a wedding on a Weekday which this was). I understand it\u2019s disappointing for the bride and groom but it\u2019s the reality of leaving things so last minute", "'silly shit' that got a laugh out of me lol", "right, what if she showed up and the posting about is \"AITA for showing up after i was told 'don't bother' because i didn't think she was serious\"", "my guess is a lot of people couldn't make the new date and bride's best friend not able to make it was the final straw.", "I take it as she didn't literally mean don't come, more like she was mad that OP wouldn't prioritize the wedding", "Hey guys! We found the bride!!", "Wow, what an asinine take", "And everyone would say she absolutely would be T A in that situation. It\u2019s completely ridiculous. The number one rule of weddings: don\u2019t fuck with the bride.", "And that\u2019s a real possibility. If it\u2019s in the middle of the week unless it were immediate family or my best friend\u2026I\u2019m not taking off work.", "Then she shouldn\u2019t have *said* not to come, and definitely shouldn\u2019t have said it and then refused to communicate for days.", "Say what you mean and mean what you say. I don\u2019t try to decipher if you really mean something or not. If you say it you mean it. If you tell me not to come I\u2019m not coming.", "Just curious are you a man or a woman?", "Just curious are you a man or a woman?", "Just curious, why TF would you think that was in any way relevant?", "Im a woman and I feel the same as the above commenter. Say what you actually mean and dont play games. It's a waste of everyone's time", "Lol I don\u2019t see what that matters but I\u2019m a woman who was born a woman. Am I on the spectrum? Maybe lol. My husband says yes. But either way it goes\u2026don\u2019t say no and mean yes.", "Women speak more indirectly and more passively most of the time. I thought it was relevant to OP's story", "Don't get me wrong I agree with you. The women in my social circles (family, significant others, etc.) just do not tend to be like that", "I mainly asked because guys usually get in trouble for not reading between the lines with this type of communication from a woman. At least that's how it is where I'm from", "I'm a woman - and woman who do this are not indecisive they are manipulative, then become passive aggressive as well as self-centred. Its not a woman thing - its a personality thing.", "Well as a woman - I say call them out on it, don't let them get away with it, unfriend them. Its pathetic.", "Yes women annoy me greatly. If you want to celebrate your birthday don\u2019t lie and say \u201cI don\u2019t want you to fuss.\u201d You don\u2019t get to get mad when he doesn\u2019t do much and you want the fuss. I think that\u2019s why my husband loves me lol. He knows if I say no\u2026I mean no.", "She tried several options. Her ex, her friends, his friends, her mother, and her child\u2019s friend\u2019s parents. For assorted reasons including \u201cnot enough notice to get time off\u201d and \u201calready going to the event she needed babysitting for\u201d, none worked. And it was *not* a true emergency."]}
