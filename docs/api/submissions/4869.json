He just told you how he doesn't trust you and now you need to seriously need to reconsider this relationship.", "NTA.\n\nYou wanted to do something to stay safer, and he yelled at you until you cried? That\u2019s seriously concerning.

I wouldn't have this much of a meltdown over my car, nor would any reasonable person.", "NTA FYI, \"don't do this because you know it will piss me off\" is how abusers groom their victims. They make it so that you're so afraid to do anything that will cause a negative reaction that you become subservient in every way. The fact that you cried, caved, and gave him a ride in your car shows that it's unfortunately working. The fact that you genuinely thought you might be TA is also evidence of that.

He can\u2019t let you drive his car a whopping four miles (including the return for pickup) even though it\u2019s a much better vehicle for the situation?

Had a reverse situation once, I had to work, my ex had the day off.  He got mad at me for wanting to know where the keys for my car were so I could go to work and wanted me to drive his truck instead of my car.  Keep in mind I preferred my car for gas and comfort drive took 30 minutes and I have known back issues, my little Buick was cheaper and easier on me than his old Ford truck that had a spring that jabbed me in the rear anytime I drove it.  There was no reason for him to want my car over his truck aside from that.   Sounds like he had no legitimate reason for declining the request and just wanting to be a pain.  You had legit concerns and he was being unreasonable.", "NTA, but why are you dating someone who literally loves his car more than he loves you?

BUT if he was concerned about issues over potential insurance problems if something happened, he'd need to communicate that, and honestly doesn't seem like that's the issue based on context that was what was going on. I know I myself have a lot of struggles letting anyone use my car even though I love my partner but that's because my family never had a car growing up and I'm genuinely afraid of losing it. \n\nThat said...NTA. I would always put my partner's safety in bad road conditions first especially if i were the one wanting to go out. But I also don't necessary think BF is the AH either if his issues are trauma or fear based.

He's an epic AH.", "Yeah exactly.", "This was kind and thoughtful. Thank you", "We always take the car with 4WD if it's snowing, or we're going to the mountains for something, even though it's technically my husband's car. It's much safer for everyone. On the flip side, we always take my car if we need to parallel park, because it's tiny.

Higher clearance and far less chance of getting stuck in snow or ice is why you take the AWD/4WD vehicle in those situations.", "Listen, I'm **wildly** overprotective of most of my things, in general, but my wife wouldn't even have to ask to take my car somewhere. I get that a spouse is different than a boyfriend, but if you've been together 5 years and he's acting like this this guy has issues, and that's a massive red flag. The fact he doesn't trust you with his 4+ year-old Honda is hilariously silly. It might make more sense if dude was driving a Lamborghini, but this wreaks of possessive issues.\n\nNo joke, this is something to re-evaluate. At this stage of a relationship there's no reason he should be yelling at you for something like this.", "I have a family member with a Honda pilot. That car was always are go to in the ice and snow. Makes total sense why you would suggest", "You're welcome! I hope things work out for the both of you especially as this sounds like a really committed relationship of many years! My partner and I like to say we fight the issues not each other, so I hope if anything, if you both decide to keep moving forward, he can acknowledge and recognize your perspective and hurt of him not listening to your point of your, and not turn to calling names or yelling in the future, which is never helpful.

However I think you\u2019d be better off without him entirely so go right ahead", "I don't know that I'd agree with this - If I were going somewhere that I couldn't park my car that was a mile away but in inclement weather I'd ask my wife if she'd be OK to drive me, but I'd also let **her pick** which vehicle we take, because I'd want to make sure she's as comfortable and safe as possible while literally doing me this favor."]}
