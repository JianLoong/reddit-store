The thing you need to hear the most right now is that the interaction you've described here is NOT NORMAL.  This is not how a discussion like this should go in a relationship.  This is not just how couples are, and this is not just how men are.\n\nI know it can be really, really hard to see this when you are inside of it and living with it every day.  There have been good times, so you brush off the bad stuff.  It all feels normal to you.  Or you've had a lot of people suggest to you (either directly or indirectly) that your BF's behavior is just typically for boyfriends and it's just what you have to put up with in order to have a man.\n\n(It has been commented on before, but it is a little scary how often you realize that hearing a lot of heterosexual couples talk, it often sounds like they do not like being married, and they don't really like each other.  All the \"ball and chain\" jokes.  All the women \"joking\" about how incompetent their husbands are and how they dream of getting away for a break from all the work they have to do for him.  etc.  It's sad.)\n\nYour suggestion was extremely reasonable, and was based on common-sense factors.  He wanted to go out.  The weather was bad.  He was asking YOU for a favor.  His vehicle is safer in that weather.  It should be a complete no-brainer.\n\nBut even if he had hesitations (obviously he does), here's what should NOT have happened: he should not have \"thrown a fit\". He should not have yelled.  He should not have called you an asshole or any other names.  The comment about \"you shouldn't have asked because you knew it would piss me off\"???  GIRL, holy shit, let that sink in.  It should NEVER have gotten to a point where his treatment of you made you cry AND you felt like you had to do what he wanted anyway.  (And drive unsafely just so that he could do what he wanted.)\n\nFor one thing, all of that is hugely out of proportion with the topic at hand.  For another -- you would not deserve this treatment no matter WHAT the topic is.   Good partners don't do this, period.\n\nThis raises really concerning questions about whether he does this a lot, too, about other things.  That whole thing about \"you should have expected it would piss me off\"... are there a lot of things you \"should know\" that you can't do around him or say to him, for fear of pissing him off?  Look, I'm not even joking -- this is one step short of \"you made me hit you\", and it's not a very far step, either.  Even if you think he is not the type to ever physically hurt you (doesn't have to be hitting you, might be grabbing you, or shoving you, or even just physically intimidating you), you may think that right up until the moment he DOES become the guy who is capable of hurting you.\n\nBecause look: he's already the guy capable of flying off the handle over something REALLY SMALL, and yelling at you over it until you cry.\n\nI'm really sorry.  You don't deserve this.  This is not normal.  This is not what relationships have to look like.  You deserve respect, and you deserve a partner who isn't selfish, paranoid, and quick to anger over small things.\n\nI know that it's not as simple as saying \"leave him\", because your lives are entangled.\n\nBut I hope all the comments here make you take a step back and look at your relationship with a stranger's eyes, and see the things about it that are alarming.  And that you do some thinking about how those things really ought to be dealbreakers.  \n\nIf you have friends and family you can reach out to for support, do that.  Don't  necessarily ask them for their opinion, because if you've been with this guy for this long, they too may fall prey to the sunk-cost fallacy (that you've been with him this long, so you don't want to give up on that; and that it's scary to break a relationship and then have to be alone for a while).  Your friends and family might also not have seen these exact behaviors from him, so they may be less inclined to be alarmed about this, even if they hear it from you.\n\nSo the kind of support I mean is: if you  do decide that this is a dealbreaker, and you're going to leave (or make him leave), get support from friends and family by \\*telling them\\* what you've decided to do, and that you need their help. Not their advice not to do it, but their help to do what you've concluded is best for you.\n\nBest of luck.

My car is too unsafe to drive in these conditions. \nWould you feel safer driving my car, because I'd really appreciate the lift?", "1. There's a snow emergency. You should avoid unnecessary driving (he should keep his ass at home)\n2. There's a snow emergency. If you *must* drive, drive the newer 4WD with better clearance.\n3. You're doing him a favour and he \"threw a fit and said no\". Very well then, he can find his way there on his own.\n4. \"He proceeded to yell, say that logic makes no sense\" - your logic makes perfect sense. He's trying to make you think you're crazy and unreasonable when you're being reasonable\n5.  \"call me the AH, especially because I knew \"asking him would piss him off\".\" Honestly, this is where it gets really worrying. He's abusive. He has trained you to believe that his abusive behaviour is your fault.\n6. \"I cried, caved, and drove him in my car.\" This is terrible. You never want to make your partner cry, and if you do, you need to do everything you can to fix that problem. Again, this sounds like an abuser.\n\nNTA. And you really need to understand you're in a relationship with an abuser. You need to get away from him. You deserve so much better than this person.", "Lol.\n\nI\u2019m sorry please drop the guy.\n\nHe is asking you drive in a snowy condition with a car that is old enough to vote (If my math is right). And screaming at you about it.\n\nNTA. It\u2019s not about how capable your car is. It\u2019s your safety on an errand that he wants you to run.\n\nNext time ask him to drive his own car himself. Better yet, don\u2019t have a next time.", "Fuck this dude. I hope you listen to everyone here", "NTA", "NTA. And from now on, tell him to drive his own car and not yours. Stop caving. If he's going to be mad about you in his car he doesn't get to drive yours.", "NTA. If you and your SO are living together I see a lot of red flags. Clearly he doesn't see you as a \"partner\" and the lack of trust is staggering.  If you're married it's even worse.", "NTA. Your reasons for taking his car are sound. I dunno what his problem is. You were doing him a favor, not the other way around. I would have taken his car also with the 4WD, and I would have said no if I couldn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially your SO put you in a situation where it didn\u2019t matter what your response was\u2026 anything less than bending over backwards doormat behavior is unacceptable to him. He would have pitched a fit if you had declined giving him a ride. How about his friend come pick him up? How about taking an uber? *Or walk,* it\u2019s less than a damn mile. I\u2019m certain the mere suggestion that you not kiss his ass just right and he\u2019s just *so* put out and disappointed in you. That\u2019s abuse, dear.\n\nHe\u2019s pitching a fit because he wants you to know the next time you do anything less than exactly what he wants you to do that he\u2019s going to cry and yell at you and tell you it\u2019s your fault. To wear you down to a point where you don\u2019t set boundaries.\n\nHe\u2019s not playing fair, OP. I hope you take these comments to heart. Maybe you can reason with him, but odds really aren\u2019t in your favor. Good luck.", "NTA, but please dump that guy.", "NTA, but the boyfriend definitely is. \n\nIt is likely time to step back and reevaluate your relationship with him. He is behaving childishly, and it sounds like he is trying to gaslight and manipulate you. \n\nHeh, he sounds like me ex, actually. I spent 20 years with him because I didn't think I deserved better. It took years of therapy to help me see that I was worth being treated with respect.\n\nGood luck to you, whatever you decide. And know that you deserve better.", "Disrespectful AH is that boyfriend. You need to John West him. You were doing him a favour and wanting to be safe. Dump his entitled behind and put all his i belongings in his ever so precious car.", "NTA. He values his car more than your safety.", "NTA. Honestly please leave him. My husband would always want me to drive the safer car, he just loves and cares for me that much. This dude doesn\u2019t love you.", "NTA, and your logic was sound. Staying with a dude that makes you break down over a car? That's questionable.", "My ex and I had a rule: whichever car handles snow better gets used in the snow, no matter which of us was driving. For a couple of years it was his car, a couple of years mine, then a couple of years we both had AWD so it didn't matter. Being safe is what matters. If there's a crash....that's what insurance is for.", "NTA. I would insist my wife drive our AWD SUV in such a situation, not our other RWD car.", "That\u2019s misogyny!", "I have a Jeep and my wife has a Honda Accord. She will take the Jeep if it\u2019s snowing and has to go somewhere, especially if it\u2019s a long distance. \nYou\u2019re NTA at all.", "What you should\u2019ve done is drive him there in your car go back to your house and grab all his crap then put it in his car drive back over there and leave it. NTA", "My SO wouldn't even let me drive in the snow. He has gotten up very early in the morning to drive me places for work so I would be safe. I'm so sorry, but it doesn't sound like you or your safety is a priority. Your SO is a tool and you are NTA.", "NTA, I think his outburst is over the top, and completely wrong. He is an asshole!", "That would've been an immediate breakup from me, girlfriend.", "NTA.  Get away from him.  I had an ex like that, he would ask for favors but I had to drive my car.  He wouldn\u2019t even put gas in it ever and would make me feel so guilty for asking him to either cover the gas or we could use his car.  He would belittle me saying I was cheap (He was well off and I was paycheck to paycheck)4 years like that until he cheated on me, then proceeded to do for her EVERYTHING he would make feel guilty over!  Run!", "Seriously. Mf would be walking himself and his bags, permanently. \n\nNTA, baby boy can Uber.", "Read it again. \n\n>I knew \"asking him would piss him off\"\n\nOP is in a relationship with an abusive partner. She has already been conditioned to believe that it's her fault. Getting out of a relationship with an abusive partner isn't always as simple as this, and I fear that following this advice might put OP in danger", "Yea I\u2019d have told him to get fucked at that point! Only a mile, could definitely have walked", "Could be extra sweet and put his stuff in his precious car and leave the key under the wheel arch, job done. Bye Felicia", "Bad sharer, bad balance, bad boyfriend, bad situation.", "Please tell me you are talking about putting the bf on the curb in the snow because that is where he belongs", "That's fine. I just wanted to point out that the extremely common refrain of \"AWD cars are safer in winter conditions\" is, at best, not backed up by facts, and at worst, shown to be the opposite by facts.", "And being pissed off that she even asked to take his car? How do you function for 5 years in a relationship like this? It sounds exhausting.", "I love this too!", "Yeeeees. THIS IS A NECESSARY STEP!", "Cats need oil and gas?! Our vet has told us all they need is food, water, and some toys\u2026. Maybe that\u2019s why our cats scream all the time? \n\nI\u2019ll check their tires next time, just in case \ud83e\udd14\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.", "The Accord is definitely NTA :-)", "\ud83d\ude02 I had no idea what you were talking about when I got the notification lmao", "Interesting, thank you for explaining it to me!", "Damn that\u2019s crazy! Thank you for explaining it to me!", "You\u2019re NTA but you really shouldn\u2019t be treated like that. You\u2019ll have to start standing up for yourself big time or leave, because he\u2019s not going to be any nicer to you of his own accord. And the longer he has to treat you like this and gaslight you, the worse it will be. Best of luck.", "NTA. And you spelled Ex boyfriend wrong. His behavior is immature and bordering on abusive. \n\nPlus, if it\u2019s less than a mile, he could just walk instead of treating you like shit.", "INFO: are you happy living like this? It doesn\u2019t matter how much you have lost to this relationship\u2014only what you will lose by staying.", "This is abuse. NTA the fact that you think you are and he is STILL upset about a reasonable request says a lot about how long this abuse has been going on in other areas of your lives", "So what I'm hearing, I hope. is that you're now single and ready to mingle? If I got that wrong please take the time and correct this, thanks \u263a\ufe0fNTA", "NTA. Girl, you need to leave. Leave soon. Like, you should've been gone by yesterday. He's a walking red flag. Men who yell about their cars are toxic. Are you perchance dating my ex? He threw a temper tantrum when I parked in his spot once (there were no assigned parking spots, he just really liked that one).", "NTA, but please stop being a pushover. Your boyfriend will continue to treat you like a doormat since you let him. His extreme reaction is alarming and I don't understand how you can be with a person like this.", "Nta. He sounds like a baby having a tantrum.", "... The only way you are TA is if he's still your BF after that- in that case you're being TA to yourself.\n\nDump his ass. That's just not OK.\n\nNTA", "Maybe they didn't but definitely found an Abuser for sure!", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nIs this really how you want to live the rest of your life?", "NTA: If this is how he acts now, you may want to reassess things.", "If my man didnt want to share his car \u2026\u2026..Id not share myself", "Nta. I would have told him no. If he wants to act like that dont give in", "\u201cA bad sharer\u201d? But he drives your car all the time?\n\nIf you stay together and eventually get married, will everything be labeled as either \u201cHis\u201d and \u201cOurs\u201d since he won\u2019t share his things but sees no problem with making use of yours? Seems pretty lopsided to me.", "That\u2019s not how car insurance in the U.S. works. Insurance agents will specifically ask if anyone lives in your household and if they have access to drive your vehicles as they will need to be listed as drivers in order for insurance to cover that driver without issue. \nIf the person getting insurance explicitly says, \u201cno one but me is driving this vehicle,\u201d and someone they let drive their vehicle gets into an accident (happens an absurd amount), the claim gets immensely more difficult. \nLike there\u2019s more context to these situations that changes the outcome and what goes on your record that Underwriters see but believe me there\u2019s so much more into insurance than even the insurance companies let the Insured\u2019s know about (e.g. I was literally told by my boss to not explain certain things because people have such a minimal understanding of insurance that it makes the process more difficult despite the fact it\u2019s information they *should* be made privy to).\n\n\nEdit: To answer some of the questions y\u2019all\u2019ve DM\u2019d me: \n\n1.) If her bf has her excluded as a driver on his insurance (which is the case if she\u2019s not listed as a driver despite living in the household) and she gets into an accident in that vehicle his options would essentially be the following:  1. Adding her as a driver and letting his premium increase to account for her driving or 2. Sign a waiver explicitly excluding her as a driver and waiving the insurance company\u2019s obligation to fulfill a claim if she was the driver during an accident in the future. \n\n2.) I\u2019m a licensed insurance agent specializing in Auto/Home, I\u2019d recommend anyone take the courses from your local college because it\u2019s information I\u2019m furious is not common knowledge. Insurance varies state by state and you\u2019d be surprised how many people think another state\u2019s insurance regulations apply to their state. \n\n3.) If you have any questions about your insurance, please reach out to your agent! Ask them specific questions and if you don\u2019t like the responses you receive just call around different offices. You\u2019d be amazed how even within the same company a different agent/office can make a drastic difference.", "\n>And now people are gonna say it's *MY* fault I'm still putting up with this sh*t.\n\nThere's a lot of societal bullshit that goes into the dating mentality that that would be a gross over simplification and unfair to you. Don't make waves, be nice, it could be worse, at least he doesn't hit you, etc etc. But AITA sees a *lot* of abusive relationships without being able to do squat about it except yell as loud as we can hoping it voices will overpower those voices long enough to help the person being abused get out, or at least start a safe plan for getting out.\n\nWe are total strangers who are trying our best to convey to you that we absolutely should not be more concerned for your safety and happiness than the person who is supposed to number amongst those who love you most.", "I think it might be dangerous.", "NTA-When people show you who they are and how much they respect you, you should pay attention.", "NTA\n\nIf there is significant snow and/or ice, I would rather be in a newer 4WD car, with newer suspension, smarter traction control. etc.\n\nHonestly, as he was being so unpleasant about it and made you cry, I think you should have told him to drive himself or get an Uber.", "I\u2019m a new driver and I\u2019m pretty shit at it tbh.

Why should you use YOUR gas to do HIM a favour in a vehicle LESS suited to the conditions? Total pillock.\n\nEdit to add NTA.", "Be proud of your car OP and don't let your AH of a boyfriend disrespect it by wanting to use it when there's more risk of an accident. From the beginning it sounded as if he asked you to drive him so it was your car the one at risk while his was safe at home. It  unnerving that he'd put his car over your safety.\n\nI don't usually like Reddit way of seeing things and how easily people suggest other people leave their partners, but in this case I agree with most of them. Your boyfriend is not a keeper, he's a selfish person who doesn't deserve your care and patience. The fact he reacted that way and even called you names makes me uncomfortable."]}
