Accord is not AWD. Pilot is. Having AWD/4WD in snow is the difference between maintaining and losing control. My wife drives an Explorer for that reason and I have always had a 4WD truck, almost exclusively because we get Great Lakes snow.\n\nThe point about you doing him a favor so the least he can do is let you drive his car shouldn't even be a factor. You guys should've taken his car just for the sole factor of safety and reliability of getting there. He needs to chill out. It's also less than a mile, so basically no gas and for what it is worth, he could've WALKED. You're not supposed to drive in snow emergencies unless you have a valid reason and good transportation. If your accord would've gotten stuck, what would be the plan to get it out?

You wanting to drive your bf\u2019s Pilot was about safety, and his reaction to that is pretty concerning because it could be interpreted that he finds his possessions more important than your safety (and you were doing him a favor!)\n\nEven when my husband and I were dating, we drove each other\u2019s cars if the weather called for one car over the other.

Your boyfriend cared more about his 4wd drive car getting messed up in the weather than his gf being safe in the weather.\n\nYou need a new boyfriend as this type of thinking is not changeable.

I'd very sweetly volunteer to drive him in my car, and be calling an emergency locksmith to change the locks on the way home.

Also, growing up my family had a wide variety of vehicles, including large trucks, which I've driven for years. So I'd say I've got more practice driving than him.\n\nHe's a bad sharer and protective of everything that's his. Been together 5 years and i have only been allowed to drive his car twice.

It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to value a car more than safety.", ">But INFO: are you a good driver? Have you been in any accidents (big or small)?

That's what a true partner does.", "The question here is if it is a big difference in safety or a smaller one vs  the risk of damaging an older car rather than  a new one. Not a life or death matter.", "Then full on overreaction. You need to sit him down and talk this over and share your feelings, how his reaction made you feel and how uncalled for it was. Communication is key to avoid this happening again. And if he is not willing to then... you know what the next step would be.", "Then it\u2019s safer for him, for you, and for the car to take his car. He should be a little more concerned about your safety, imho. You will also need to repeat the trip to pick him up, right?", "I'm going to go with NTA. It's less than a mile, which your Accord would make no problem on ice. Snow, though, is heavier duty, so 4x4 could be beneficial.

Bro, it's a 2018 Honda Pilot, not a Rolls Royce. Relax.", "Not AH at all. He should realize what his actions speak to those who aren\u2019t knee deep in a 5 year inequitable relationship.

That happens sometimes \ud83d\ude05", "Honestly, what would you hope to get out of it? Realistically from what you\u2019ve said he doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of guy who after 5 years you\u2019ll convince to treat you well or be less selfish with a Reddit thread.", "To add to this. It's a snow emergency and you asked your GF to give you a ride in it someplace less than a mile away? Have you heard of something called legs and walking? Why would you ask someone to drive you in that weather? I would never ask someone to give me a ride in that type of weather unless it was an emergency and then I would have suggested that we use my car because it's safer with 4wheel drive and newer so less chance of something happening. BF is for sure TA."]}
