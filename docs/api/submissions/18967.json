{"id": 18967, "submission_id": "140k0ro", "title": "AITA for refusing to meet a friend during her vacations ?", "selftext": "To give you a little description of the situation : I am a 27-year-old man living in Paris, in a 100% remote job. This suits me very well because I am an extremely asocial person, meaning that I basically don't leave my house except to go grocery shopping. I don't socialize with anyone in real life simply because it scares me. I dislike the way others look at me and the feeling of not \"fitting in,\" etc.\n\nSo, my social interactions are exclusively online, and as a result, I spend quite a bit of time on chat apps like Interpals (for those who are not familiar: it's an international chat app, focused on language learning).\n\nIt was precisely on Interpals, about 5 months ago, that a 25-year-old Polish woman approached me. We quickly got along very well: we had the same sense of humor and shared similar interests. Within two weeks, we were talking to each other all day long. She sometimes tried to make the conversation more sexual, but I always pretended not to notice or subtly changed the subject to avoid, as I didn't want her to expect anything from me.\n\nEverything changed two weeks ago when she told me she had bought tickets to spend a week in Paris in June, saying it would finally be an opportunity for us to \"meet in person.\" For me, it was a cold shower because I absolutely didn't want that. I explained to her as kindly as possible that it wouldn't happen (she was well aware of my socialization issues), but she persisted for 2-3 days, trying to change my mind, which obviously didn't happen. However, since then, I feel that our conversations have changed. We don't talk as much, and she seems more distant. I must admit that it hurts me because I don't see how not wanting a real-life friendship would prevent an online friendship...\n\nSo, I have a question for you: AITA refusing to meet her considering my \"history\" (my extreme introversion)? ISTA for wanting to end a good friendship for this reason? Thank you in advance !\n\n**I realize from reading your comments that a little more information is needed :**\n\n\\- She already knew that I would refuse any IRL meeting, in the course of our conversations she had already raised the possibility of meeting several times, each time I had been clear on the subject by saying that from my side it was not possible (and this had not diminished the quality of our exchanges thereafter).\n\n\\- She's not coming to Paris alone, she's going with a friend, so I don't think I'm the main reason she's coming (at least I hope not).\n\n\\- I'm aware that my condition of extreme introversion/social phobia may seem totally stupid to many, but it's mine. I've accepted that I'm not cut out for social interaction IRL, I've accepted that we can't all win at the game of life and that it's therefore better for everyone if I stay to myself, for myself as well as for others. And that it was better for her and for me not to meet.", "created_utc": 1685899922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140k0ro/aita_for_refusing_to_meet_a_friend_during_her/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you've explained your reasoning (and I have online friends I don't want, or need, to meet face to face),  she's not very understanding. Her persistence doesn't show empathy or any kind of understanding to your messages.

But you were clear with your boundaries and that you didn't want to do that. If she can't respect that, don't keep her in your life.\n\nThat being said, make sure you're taking care of yourself, too. Live life as fully as you can!\n\nNTA, my dear. You do you.", "NAH\n\nYou are who you are, and you have made that clear. \n\nShe, like most people, would like to meet her friends in person given the opportunity.\n\nNeither of you are wrong, and it's also not wrong of her to limit her bonding with you now that she sees that you never want to meet her in real life. \n\nI would ask, though, why you are so uncomfortable meeting someone IRL that you already know pretty well. I understand not wanting to interact with strangers, but I just don't get this. It's okay, I don't think you're an AH for it, I'm just curious.", "NTA but\u2026..there are very few people like you who don\u2019t want any social interaction in person with anyone. It\u2019s beyond being introverted.  It sounds like more of a phobia or social disconnect.   (ETA: I see that you edited your post to label yourself as asocial rather than introverted. That paints a clearer picture.)\n\nIt is completely understandable that she assumed that your online friendship hasn\u2019t entered the real world only due to distance. And now your refusal to meet when she\u2019s in Paris is seen as either (1) rejection or (2) that you misrepresented who you are and that in person there would be some unpleasant surprises.  So she backed away. Most people would.", "NTA but you really should try to get a few irl friends and look into therapy to get over your fear of people. That\u2019s no way to live.", "NTA - if she only bought the ticket to meet you, she should have had that conversation with you before hand. You have a right to stay inside your comfort zone.", "Tbh i am going to go with YTA, but to yourself and tbh a bit to this person who cares about you and has obvious grown to like you as a person. \n\nYou aren\u2019t describing introversion, you are describing by crippling social anxiety. You giving it the wrong label and brushing it off whilst living in your bubble isn\u2019t helping you.\n\nGet yourself into therapy or similar and start realising that what you are describing can\u2019t just be brushed off as introversion and instead describe it for what it is. Also tell the person you have hurt what it actually is as they may want to help.", "NTA, it seems like you made things clear and she decided she was the exception to that. I'm sorry for that pressure put on you.", "ESH, her for continuing to plan a trip you obviously don't want. And you for refusing to meet a friend you've been talking to for five months. I'm sorry, but if you're always going to keep your interpals friends at such a distance, even after such a long time, you are not really being a friend. I think you should see a therapist about this though, and not seek asshole judgment from reddit. This is more a mental health issue than an asshole decision.", "NTA. But this friendship is over.", "You live in *Paris*, and you only leave your home to go get groceries. My god, what a waste. \n\nBut never mind that. On to the question at hand. \n\nOP, you can have online only friends. But sometimes they might want to meet up. Like this woman that wants to go all the way to another country to actually meet you. That is what you risk. \n\nShe *liked* you. Obviously she thinks there might be romantic opportunities with you. Well\u2026 now she probably thinks you are a catfish and is done with you.

I would seek therapy it sounds very lonely and like the 2 of you get along great.

She doesn\u2019t understand your position either. She thought your connection was valuable and wanted to meet you in person. Maybe she developed feelings for you.
