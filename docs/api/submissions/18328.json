I drew it as it stands for blessing and good luck in my country. I said I am sorry, but for me, this symbol stands for something else.

Yeah, we all know what the first association with swastikas is here, but it's also very true that the swastika was a religious symbol in the East looooong before a certain guy in Germany decided to make it his own. In your culture, it literally has a completely different meaning.", "**NAH**\n\nYou aren't the asshole here, but neither are they. The swastika is... a complex issue. On the one hand, it was used for centuries, if not millenia, as an important spiritual and religious icon. On the other hand, it was appropriated by a truly evil man and was the banner under which one of the worst atrocities in human history was carried out.\n\nIt's perfectly understandable that your Jewish friend had such a visceral reaction to what she perceives as a hate symbol.\n\nHowever, they need to keep in mind that it is a **very** neo-colonialist attitude to decide that one white guy gets to steal an important symbol from a billion people half the world away and prevent them from using it.\n\nI think you should talk to her directly about this, and explain yourself well. If there is a university counseller or something that can help mediate that would be ideal. If she wont talk, try writing a letter and giving it to her to read at her own leisure.\n\nI would say something like:\n\n*\"I am truly sorry that seeing my swastika upset you so much. I wish it had occured to me to either warn you about it beforehand, or put it away before you arrived. But it didn't, and I can't change that.*\n\n*But I need you to understand that for myself and over a billion people, this is not a hate symbol. It has been used for generations as a blessing of luck and peace. We refuse to allow the (not sure if this sub lets me use the actual name of the group so lets go with Not-Seas) to steal it from us and pervert it. It is our culture, and it is not fair to us to have it perverted this way.*\n\n*I am genuinely sorry that this caused you distress. I hope you can understand that this was not a hateful act on my part, and if you have any questions I would be happy to answer them. I also understand that you might need some time to come to terms with this, because for you it has only ever been a hate symbol. I will leave you alone after this. I hope we can go back to being friends, but if we can't I wish you only the best.\"*", "NTA.\n\nI understand their initial shock, but following an explanation it should've ended there.\n\nContext is important, and yours is clear. The swastika for Hindus (and others) held significance long before the Nazis distorted it (both symbolically and visually) - and this has, and will, remain the case throughout much of Asia, and for Asians living abroad. Put simply, you didn't display the Hakenkreuz (the Nazi swastika). Period. \n\nFurther, for them to accuse others of not knowing 'the sentiment behind the symbol', something they too are seemingly unable or unwilling to do - and in your own home - is entirely unfair. There are places of worship (Hindu, Buddhist, etc.) throughout the West displaying the swastika: would those accusing you of being TA say the same across each of these instances, or would they be sensible enough to realise that, again, those swastikas are not the Hakenkreuz, and as such carry an entirely different meaning?", "i\u2019d say NAH just because this is a very complicated, nuanced, and sensitive issue. Especially when you consider that neo-nazi\u2019s today still use the swastika as a hate symbol. For many people it does represent hatred to the point of genocide, those associations don\u2019t go away overnight. \nYou\u2019re entitled to use your cultural symbols in whatever way you seem fit (especially because it seems you had no ill intent), but your friends are also entitled to their feelings, especially your Jewish friend.  I\u2019m sure this was all just a misunderstanding, but if I were you i\u2019d just be careful about who you\u2019re displaying that symbol to, that\u2019s all.", "Theres a lot of assumptions here and I don't think everyone properly knows, In Hinduism, the right-facing symbol (clockwise) (\u5350) is called swastika.\n\nIt continues to be used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It generally takes the form of a cross, the arms of which are of equal length and perpendicular to the adjacent arms, each bent midway at a right angle.\n\nThey are not the same as a Nazi swastika.", "NTA. The swastika was culturally appropriated and bastardised by an evil man. I understand why your roommate had a visceral reaction but some cultural awareness on her part wouldn\u2019t hurt her either.", "I\u2019m sorry but it sounds like your lab mates arguments are \u201cRespect our belief system over your own\u201d\n\nWhich is just downright disrespectful.\n\nAlso, if I\u2019m right, isn\u2019t the swastika a mirror of the original vertically?\n\nNTA but I can understand the rushed judgement of your lab mates, you should try explaining again that it doesn\u2019t mean what they think it means, how the imagery was stolen from your culture and unfortunately, the majority of people see it the wrong way.", "NTA\n\nI remember the first time I saw that version of the swastika in a Hindu person's home. I did a double take, thought about it for thirty seconds, looked at how it was part of a larger image, and then went and asked them about it. Conversation took less than 5 minutes.\n\nThese labmates overreacted and are ignorant and culturally insensitive.\n\nWhite Americans are often the most closed minded people I've ever met in my life.", "NTA but I hope you take note of the upset it causes even though for you it means something else. I remember walking past a house with a swastika on the door (in the UK) as a teenager that I eventually realised belonged to a Hindu family but initially I felt fear and distress, and even after I wondered why they would have it there, knowing what it meant to others walking past. It made me question if maybe they HAD wanted to make that statement, or just didn't care if they were making it. I think I was wrong then to question that, but I also think it's not commonly used outside of Asia because of the confusion that it causes, so I hadn't seen it before. It was a shock so I understand her reaction. Not the ice out afterwards, since you didn't know. Though you didn't say what happened during the argument, so that could explain it.", "NAH. This is a simple case of cultural dissonance. What the swastika means to you as an Indian man is different from what it means to others. Your friends should educate themselves on the other significance of the symbol. However, you should be cautious about its display, because there is a lot of loaded symbolism behind the Swastika, which is unfair, but true. I will point out that had you left out the fact that you are Indian, you would be getting very different comments on this thread.", "NTA - I very much hope your friends are not postdoc students. I don\u2019t want anybody that stupid to hold a doctorate in anything. The swastika has stood as a religious symbol for thousands of years before it became a symbol for the nazis. Put it where ever you want. You didn\u2019t need to \u201cinform\u201d yourself of anything before \u201ccoming to America\u201d. They\u2019re the ones severely lacking general information. They tried calling you insensitive and ignorant when they\u2019re the ones who are being insensitive and ignorant about your religion and culture. There\u2019s a very racist undertone to how they acted, which is very ironic because they were trying to claim that you were racist. The stupidity actually hurts.", "NAH. You did something normal for you, although you could have figured out it\u2019s kind of taboo in the states. Your friends had a natural reaction, although they could have listened to your explanation. \n\nI went with no AH rather than E S H since I don\u2019t think the errors rise to the level of sucking. Just an unfortunate miscommunication.", "NTA\n\nThey need to be just as culturally aware and sensitive to your culture as you need to be to theirs. You have all been friendly in the past & I believe this can be worked through. \n\nFWIW: I was kicked off of Facebook during 2020 because I put up two pictures asking this question: \n\nWhat do these symbols mean to you?\n\na Confederate flag.\na swastika. \n\nI was banned for hate speech even though my goal was to make others aware of how the swastika has been used throughout history & how it is still used today. \n\nHowever, FB took it down because that horrific human used it for a symbol representing the destruction of a portion of humanity. \n\nThe USA is currently at a large crossroads when it comes to dealing with its history of hatred & this appears to be a real-time instance that we all can learn from. Teachable moment for all of us. Yay! \n\nIt\u2019s my hope that your lab partners will be open to recognizing their ignorance (and prejudice) in this situation. It is also my hope that you understand the hurt this would have caused a Jewish woman & be empathetic of her reaction as well.", "Swastika isn't the same as that symbol. You should show them the difference. Theyll understand", "NTA not your fault that people get upset without knowing the facts first. I've seen this happen multiple times. People don't know the origin of symbols and then get offended due to their own ignorance.", "I'll say this- I used to live a few blocks away from the largest Hindu temple in the Phoenix area.  They had a flyer for new immigrants which explained why displaying the swastika was viewed poorly and asked that people refrain from kindness to the neighbors.", "NTA. Tell your friend we had our own atrocities no one talks about. Our religion was also attacked and we lost millions and millions of people for our nationality and religion. Our languages, culture, religious stuff, were all hijacked, mocked and they attempted to erase it.\n\nPlus the symbol your friend should be upset with is the Hakenkreuz. They're infringing on your religious freedom due to misinformation or ignorance.\n\nIt's not fair to ask you to keep stifling our religion because a monster misappropriated our symbol to hurt. Same as Jewish people have suffered, so have Indians. We also reserve the right to reclaim something that means so much to us, especially when the symbol people hate isn't even the same thing.", "NTA but could have told them to avoid it. Unless you had the n@zi flag with the swastikas inside then it\u2019s just a cultural thing for you.", "I'm leaning towards NAH, but it does depend a little bit on how well drawn the swastika was. If it's quite intricate and part of a larger pattern, it looks very different to just a swastika on its own scrawled on the wall. You should definitely be aware that in America and most western countries, there is still a heavy emotional reaction to that symbol, and people's first thought will be nazi, not Hindu.", "NTA \n\nIt's a symbol that has been used to around Eurasia since before written history. And it's been used to represent luck and well-being in the east long before hitler was even born.", "NTA. Anybody saying you are should be ignored. Jews don't get to cry and erase your culture because Hitler did the Holocaust and Asians don't use the hakenkreuz.\n\nThey can try to understand your culture and beliefs, or they aren't worth your time.", "NTA: They are also prevalent in Native American culture (pre-hitler) Pima people associate the image with the four winds. Understand why the person was upset but when you explained what it represented to you pre dating (Hitler) it made all of them the assholes for continuing to make you feel bad. They are all A H and you deserve a apology.", "Your not an asshole. BUT cultural sensitivity goes a long way. When Americans visit other places we are reminded to be mindful of their ways and practices and if we don\u2019t abide we get dirty looks and corrected (rightfully so). It\u2019s the same here. In the west that symbol is one of hate, white supremacy and antisemitism. It\u2019s symbolizes the genocide of 11 million+ people, half of whom were Jewish. \n\nYou should take it down. If you don\u2019t after seeing the harmful impact it had\u2026 then your an asshole.", "NTA", "I can understand the friend\u2019s initial reaction. I mean, you look over and there\u2019s a symbol that is the \u201csame\u201d one worn by people who thought mass murder was a logical response to not liking how you worshipped G-d. (I know it isn\u2019t exactly the same, but probably she just reacted and didn\u2019t think about which way the arms facing.) However, you explained that it\u2019s something that existed as a positive symbol for thousands of years before those dumbfucks stole it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if they can\u2019t resolve the two ideas in their minds. I\u2019m Jewish and I\u2019ve managed to.\n\nNTA.", "[deleted]", "I understand your point of view OP, but it's totally unrealistic to think it's okay to display something that looks like a swastika in the US, even if your intentions are different.  Especially in the current environment where Jewish people and other minorities are experiencing a lot of violence and discrimination.", "[deleted]", "NTA but my friend, you are a bit dense. Suggest you explain, with reference books if possible, what this symbol means in your culture. But take it down for the length of your stay. If your university offers it, try to attend a cultural assimilation class on US culture. Might help for the rest of your stay.", "Your lab mates are the AH here, their lack of culture is abhorrent.", "YTA.\n\nThere have been so many scholarly papers, journals, articles, and even anecdotes from Hindus all over the world who have said things to the effect that, \"yes, this symbol was ours for thousands of years before the Nazis stole it and destroyed what it is meant to represent... And it absolutely is meant to be a blessing... but it has been so irretrievably corrupted that we are effectively abandoning it, we cannot erase the evil that has been done to it and linked to it. Out of respect for the horrors that have been visited upon our Jewish siblings, and a wish not to inflict harm, we will not use it anymore.\"\n\nI'm not going to tell you what to do or how to practice in your life. \n\nBut as someone who is Jewish, I will say that *that symbol* evokes a *visceral\" reaction, any time I see it. Any time, any place, anywhere. And if I had seen it in the home of someone I'd thought was a friend, I almost certainly would have started sobbing too. Especially if it were hand drawn.\n\nI am not accusing you of anything- only trying to impress upon you the seriousness of what your friend felt. She walked into what she felt was a place of safety, and was confronted with a symbol that haunts our nightmares, and has done so for decades. Nearly all of us have one or more direct family members that were taken from us by people who wore that symbol. It is linked to generational trauma, and in recent years has been seen marching through the streets again, along with calls for our blood.\n\nShe was probably terrified.\n\nIn this country, that symbol has a wildly different connotation than in India- and its connotation is that you want a whole lot of people dead.\n\nI don't think you're that type of person- but I highly suggest both taking it down, and writing a letter to your Jewish friend apologizing and asking if there is anything you can do to make it up to her... though, please be aware that it may be a good long time before she trusts you again, or wants to be alone with you. Like I said, that symbol creates a very visceral reaction for us. Please be prepared that these bridges may take a significant amount of time to be repaired, if ever.", "As long as it isn't a black swastika in a white circle surrounded by red, then you're good. It is part of your heritage and has a meaning of peace, not of hate. It seems that your \"friends\" need some education. NTA", "I have to wonder if you really don't know what it means in the west and aren't being provocative on purpose. Any chance you're affiliated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and just playing \"whoops\" here?", "Soft YTA.  I understand it has a specific meaning for you,  however Hitler corrupted the view of the swastika for millions in Europe, the USA and elsewhere, and part of traveling internationally is being aware of culturally significant taboos like displaying this symbol. \n\nI think you should take it down, as you've seen the impact it is having.", "The swastika dates back thousands of years across many different cultures.  Each culture had a different meaning for it, but it was usually something positive like good luck, or fortune, or blessings.  Bronze age Armenians used to represent eternal life.  The Hopi and Navajo used it.  Carlsberg Brewery used it as part of the logo in the early 20th century.  The 45th Infantry division in the US Army used it until the start of WW2.  \n\nThen Hitler came along and ruined it for everyone.  To think that it would not be offensive to people in the west means YTA", "Don\u2019t go around wearing it on a ring in public or something, but in your own home? NTA. You can take it down when your friend is not there, that\u2019s fine, but they need to understand the difference between a nazi and a hindu", "NTA but you are going to have this same experience many, many times in the USA.", "NTA. It's so sad that Hitler corrupted a religious symbol. As an American, I had no idea that it was a religious symbol until a year or so ago. For us, it was only a sign of hate. Keep doing you and educate people.", "NTA,  maybe take the time to educate people about the symbol and it's meaning in your culture. I suggest a definition posted explaining. You shouldn't have to do this but it is a shared living space. Good luck!", "NTA but your labmate had quite a shock in an unexpected place. I suspect you might not have been understanding yourself, after all you were being verbally attacked. Deescalating is complex and hard.

Nobody would bring that with them to their grad school accommodations from India.\n\nWhat bullshit agenda are you trying to push?", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s your own home and your own culture \n\nAnd the swastikas aren\u2019t even the same - the Nazi one is specifically at an angle \n\nThe doctoral students better get realistic about working with different cultures \n\nHope their work never brings them to China or Taiwan because there are temples with swastikas all over the place", "Here is the reality, if you want to make any friends in the US, take it down it is extremely offensive in our culture.", "SOFT YTA. Yes your are entitled to decorate your home in any fashion as you see fit, including symbols of that nature.

I would calmy explain that, and from now on just don't display the items unless people are already aware of what it is.", "YTA - I appreciate that the swastika was not always a hate symbol, but it has been well publicised that it has been one for almost a century. It's like calling someone a slur and justifying you can say it because they did 100 years ago. It doesn't negate the offense in the now.\n\nI don't believe that you had no concept of the symbols association to the Nazi movement or the meaning it had outside your home country. It's pretty much the most well known symbol in the world.

He came home to my grandma and she didn't recognize him standing at the door ( he'd disappeared for months)  she told him she had no extra food to spare (had a young child and my mom on the way born June 7, 1944 the day after D-Day)  He said \"it's me\".

Just because i\u2019m talking about a certain thing, doesn\u2019t mean i\u2019m minimizing something else. The truth and the point still stands, it originally meant something else. It was appropriated.

The earliest known use of a swastika-like symbol is from 10,000 BCE, carved in *literal stone*. The implication that it\u2019s popular in India because of Adolf Hitler is disgustingly offensive. It\u2019s a major symbol of Hinduism, and also a symbol in Buddhism, Jainism, etc. it\u2019s used not just in India but in in East Asia ( particularly China and Japan ), as a symbol for good luck, longevity and more.

I see that it\u2019s drawn at a different angle, which is something that could be lost on people from the west. This sounds like a misunderstanding and the other people dug their heels in rather than admitting there was more going on.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards NTA here honestly, but I maintain that your comment was responding to an argument the original commenter didn\u2019t make - they specifically said that while travelling you have to be mindful of taboos in other cultures, there was no suggestion that the billions of people who have used this symbol over the years should change their practice", "Yeah, damn there are a lot of people on this thread who don't seem to think you can be Hindu and American (or European, or 'western')", "OK.
