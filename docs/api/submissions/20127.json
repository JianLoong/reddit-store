Anyway, we made plans together for a game night, and then I was reminded of a birthday party my daughter was invited to that coincided on the same day. I had told my daughter she could attend this party almost 2 months ago, so I was like, \"oh yeah! Well, that's fine\". It doesn't affect our game night, but it's a spend the night party, and so she won't be home. My friend doesn't want to come now because her daughter would just be bored. I didn't anticipate that, and wonder if I made an AH move there...unintentionally, but still. I question it because I asked another friend of mine if I should've anticipated that, and she said she wouldn't come over either if my child wasn't there to occupy hers because it would just make it where she couldn't enjoy her time with me. From my pov, I would just tell my daughter the deal and let her bring her tablet or something to occupy her.\n\nAlso, to clarify a question that might come up, my friend's daughter didn't know we were getting together, so it's not like she was anticipating spending that time with my daughter and would be disappointed for having that taken away. \n\nIDK...AITA?", "created_utc": 1687207752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dq8ug/aita_for_telling_my_child_she_can_go_to_a/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't realistically tell your daughter she can't go to a birthday party that she is already committed to, that would be unreasonable.

The modification doesn\u2019t work for your friend. She doesn\u2019t have to go along with this change just because you would if the roles were reversed. Just reschedule.

Not letting your daughter go would've been the asshole thing to do.", "NAH, and I don't understand why this is even a question. Tell the friend you forgot about the birthday and reschedule game night. Am I missing something? Forgetting a prior committment doesn't make you an AH, nor does your friend wanting to reschedule game night for a time when your daughter will be there. It just makes logical sense.", "NAH. Your friend doesn\u2019t want her daughter to entertain herself at your house.", "Nah yet... you forgot about the party, stuff happens. But I'm on your friends side about not coming anymore. She already told her daughter she was coming to play w your daughter. It'd  be pretty shitty of her to tell her daughter tough luck, I'm still having my fiend time but you're not. Just sit on an iPad instead.  You'll turn into the AH  if you continue with the nonsense about her still coming.", "NTA but couldn't you make the game night at her place instead or do it on another night?", "NTA. Why was the daughter coming anyways? Can\u2019t your friend find a babysitter or god forbid have her father watch her. You made plans with your friend you didn\u2019t set up a play date for your daughters.

You are not responsible for providing entertainment for her kid", "NTA, I don't see a problem with what you did here.", "NTA. It's not your daughters job to entertain your friends kid. Like I can understand your friend being a little disappointed that her daughter won't have someone to play with but you can turn the night into a snack and movie night or something her daughter can still enjoy. Or realistically her daughter can bring things to entertain herself. I mean if they stayed home wouldn't her daughter be alone and have to find things to entertain herself then? Or you can apologise for the mix up of plans and reschedule with the friend to a time when your daughter is home and also wants to hang out with them.", "Info - how old are the daughters?", "**NAH** \\- You made a promise to your daughter and kept it.  You r friend doesn't want to visit under the circumstance.   That is her right.   But it doesn't sound like your friend values the friendship as much as you do.  Nothing you can do about that.", "NTA.  Your plans were with your adult friend, not his daughter.  It is up to him to make arrangements for his child, not expect you to make sure she is entertained.    \n\n\nWhen I hosted game nights for friends, if they brought a child they always brought a tablet or toy to occupy the child while the adults gamed.  Or I let the child watch TV in another room.  It was no big deal.", "Nta\n\nI'm sure your kids are friends and enjoy spending time together, but it's unreasonable to expect your daughter to just go so the other kid has someone to entertain them, that wouldn't be fair to her", "Unless y'all are playing some wildly inappropriate games, NTA.

Yes, it's my fault I forgot, but I'm surprised at the response.", "i've edited to include that her daughter didn't know they were coming, so there's no disappointment to be had. I've also not started nonsense about her still coming. I've let the issue rest with us rescheduling...not sure where you got that.", "Why couldn't op's friend just find another friend for her daughter to go hang out with for a couple of hours and then she and op could have some adult hang out time?", "At first, she asked if I would be willing to come to her house (she lives about an hour away). I said that was fine with me, but I may be a little later getting there cuz I would have to come over after I drop my daughter off. It would push things a little later because, if we kept it at my house, she could just already be there, and the kid with the birthday lives like 5 minutes from me, so it would all coincide at the same time, giving us about another hour of play time. She said it sounded like too much trouble and we could just reschedule. It's hard enough to find time to get together, so I feel bad.", ">It's not your daughters job to entertain your friends kid.\n\nBut it is OP's if he invited her over. And OP will be gaming all night, so that's pretty lame for the daughter", "Mine is 8, hers is 11.", "LOL...playing the board game version of D&D...no wild adult games to be had.", "He isn't the AH, but it's a bit ridiculous to invite an 11 yo with her father and let the child read a book, while the adults are going to game all night. OP should have went to the friends house, or simply reschedule", "Ya so no hard feelings you thought you could do it that day, you can\u2019t because of a prior commitment, make it another day soon and get together, all is good", "So. You've changed the plan and she doesn't want to come anymore. End of story.", "No, *but her mother did*, and having your daughter there to occupy her daughter was clearly part of your friend's plan. So, without your daughter there, the plan no longer works for your friend.", "It's not like she told you to not let your kid go.  I think you're making this out to be bigger than it needs to be.", "I thought you told her how you'd just make your kid go anyway.  It was a different friend, my mistake on that part.  I still say NAH. This doesn't have to be a you're right and she's wrong thing. Plans changed, stuff happens. Lots of moms would feel that same as her and not make their kid go and sit on a device for hours while they play board games.  And no ones suggesting you should have made your daughter miss her party. Just that you should suck up your mistake and take the reschedule without it being an issue.", "So find a last minute play date, drop off kid, drive an hour to fiends house, hang out for a bit and then drive an hour back to get kid. Sounds like a blast.", "I think there is crucial information missing. How old actually are their daughters. Bc a 10 year old doesn't need to be entertained by the parents. They can bring a tablet or book or watch TV. And honestly either way it's really not. OP invited the parent w the expectation that their daughter would be there to play w her.", "Shouldn't be a problem for the 11-year-old.", "My friend actually asked for the get together. It's splitting hairs about who did the inviting...that's not really how our friendship works. But I said I would love to and we could use my house. After I told her about the party, she said unless I wanted to come there, they wouldn't be able to make it. I said that would be fine with me, but I would he a little later than intended since I'd have to take my kid to the party first. She said that sounded like too much trouble for me and we'd just reschedule. So that's where it stands. We're rescheduling.", "It\u2019s not that OP changed the plan unless she was asked if her daughter would be there. Neither communicated and this is NAH. Now OP know for next time and should just reschedule game night", "I understand that completely. I was speaking to other comments that were made about disappointing the daughter if she was expecting to see mine.", "My daughter is 8, hers is 11.", "Can the friend not come without the daughter?", "Yeah I mean i read from other comments that you decided to reschedule. But especially if the other daughter didn't even know this was happening there was no disappointment. But also imo an 11 year old can entertain themselves just like they would at home without a playmate. Personally I wouldn't like my child to always be counted on to entertain a friends when they come over."]}
