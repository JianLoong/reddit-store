It sounds like your father has some weird grudge and is very controlling. You should be wary if he calls the cops and wants you home though. I really hope you can get in touch with other family who could maybe become your legal guardian. You\u2019re old enough where you can tell a judge why you would prefer a guardian over your father being a legal custodian. I\u2019m really sorry about your Mom OP and wish you the best.", "There is no way that you are the AH. Your dad is a massive one though. It's your mom's funeral. I'm sorry your dad isn't comforting you but instead attacking you. I'm so sorry you lost your mom. You are absolutely NTA and I hope you get all the time and love you need to heal.", "NTA, it is not his decision to make. It is yours and yours alone.", "NTA. She was your mother. Your father is TA for trying to stop you from going.", "NTA. \n\nYour father sounds like a real piece of work. Even if things weren't good between the two of them, he has no right to stop you from attending her funeral. I'm glad you went. If he can't accept that you had a better relationship with her due to his own jealousy and wrongdoing, that's his cross to bear, because he could have worked on his relationship with you. \n\nAlso, I'm so sorry for your loss. You're far too young to have to have lost a parent, and I'm sorry that your other parent isn't being there for you to help you through this insanely difficult time.", "What? Selfish?? Noooooo. She was your mother and you had a good relationship with her!! Totally NTA and you would regret it for your life if you didn't go. Your father shouldn't have said that!!!!", "NTA\n\nHow in the world is going to your own mothers considered as selfish? Obviously your dad is the AH here for doing all of this. I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to your mother by the way. I hope you\u2019re okay.", "Oh my lord OP! NTA in any way whatsoever!\n\nI grieve for you so much.\n\nI lost my parent early on, and no one stepped up to handle the aftermath", "Obvious NTA. His issue's with his former wife have nothing to do with you wanting to pay respects at your mothers funeral.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how in any way your actions could be considered selfish.", "NTA..  \n\n\nFrom what you say, it sounds like your father wasn't financially prepared for the event of your mother/his wife's passing, and your mothers family took over the arrangements. If so, it was probably very embarrassing for your father, hence his reluctance to go and take you. That's a pride issue and NOTHING to do with you. You did the right thing honoring your mother and attending her funeral. I'm glad you decided to go.", "NTA you weren\u2019t selfish, you *are* grieving. You lost your mother and your father decided \u201cyou weren\u2019t going\u201d that\u2019s strange and upsetting. \nStay NC for a while.", "NTA Your father couldn't get past his own selfishness and see that you needed to go. You did what you needed to do for you and there's nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. Your father wasn't in your life and he wasn't in your mother's life. There is a reason why he wasn't invited. And there was no reason that you should not attend your mother's funeral.", "Dear young OP I am truly sorry for your loss and you are NTA going to say your farewells to your mum. Your dad controlling and forbidding you from attending your own mum's funeral is very unfair and cruel coming from him\n\nI am glad you have a supportive boyfriend and his family taking you in and being supportive all the way. No, you are not selfish for attending the funeral. Don't feel bad about it\n\nMoving forward you continue to grieve as much as you need to. Don't let your dad tell you otherwise and do not listen to him. In the meantime, you can go low contact on dad and take all the time you need to heal and mourn", "He does not get to decide how you grieve\n\nNta\n\nThe conflicts of your father and his in laws are that, his problems.\n(and him not involved in the proceedings about his partner, something is missing)..\n\nOr were you given reasons other than \"do as I tell you!\"?", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
