And in case anyone uses any of these actions to claim you are, I want to explain each one of them.\n\nYour father has not been there for your upbringing. He has no right to make a decision for you which will affect your entire adult life. And trust me, missing your parent's funeral will stay with you, for good or ill, for the rest of your life.\n\nYou argued with your father. This does not make you the AH. You have a right to disagree with the adults in your life, and to voice your opinions. It would likely have been a better choice to have a calm conversation, and if that was not possible, to simply leave (as you eventually did anyway). That means maybe you didn't make the best choice. But all people, even adults, make decisions which aren't the best sometimes. It doesn't automatically make you an AH if you could have done something \"better\". It just makes you a person.\n\nYou called him names. This was not a healthy way to handle the situation, and some people will say this makes you an AH. But you're 16. He was being hurtful, saying something hurtful, denying you something you had every right to, and it's natural, under those circumstances, to say things we might not normally say. Again, people make mistakes, and not all of those mistakes mean you're an AH.\n\nYou left, moved out, moved in with your bf. That doesn't make you an AH. You were in a place where you no longer felt safety and security, being denied something you have a right to. Leaving was a responsible and brave choice. \n\nNow there might be people who will say \"calling people names is abusive\" (and it is, usually). And that you're the AH because you didn't do it *right*. That just because someone else is being an AH doesn't mean you *aren't*. \n\nAnd that's usually true. Rudeness does not excuse rudeness. Abuse does not excuse more abuse. \n\nBut for one, there is a power dynamic at play here. Your father was in a position of power, and whether intentionally or not, being abusive toward you. You have a right, in those circumstances, to use force you wouldn't normally use, to escape the situation. If that includes using words to shock/wound, that's understandable.\n\nFor two, usually, yes, rudeness should be met with a *polite* shutdown. But sometimes it cannot be shut down politely. It would be more rude to allow it to continue. \n\nYou did not handle this situation the way I would have handled it. But I can't say for certain what I would have done differently, because I've never been through it. And what you did was fine.\n\nYour father was being a total AH. Maybe he's always an AH. Maybe he was acting out of grief, idk.\n\nYou reacted to his behavior in a completely understandable way. \n\nIt's not how I would expect my child to react in this situation. But I would be proud of my child if they handled themselves as well as you did.\n\nIn the end, it is your mother's funeral. It is *your* choice if you attend. Your father is absurd at the best and an abusive AH at the worst. \n\nYou have a right to stay somewhere safe. You have a right to go to your mom's funeral. You have a right to grieve however you need to grieve. And you are most definitely not the AH here.\n\nAnd I am so sorry that you lost your mom.
