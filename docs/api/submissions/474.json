Carmen is a single mom of 2 and works as a nurse. Michael and his wife are teachers and are expecting their first child. Carmen makes $100k Michael and his wife make a little over $100k combined and we live in California near the Bay Area, where 100k is considered low income.\n\nElisa is a nanny for an extremely rich family. I don't know if she's considered live in because she lives in a separate house but on the same property. She makes $250k per year plus bonuses, doesn't pay for rent or utilities, rarely buys groceries because she always eats with the family, they bought her a brand new car, they pay for her gas, maintenance, all of her medical, dental, vision, etc. is 100% paid for by the family. Hell, they even pay for her gym membership and her vacations. She's worked for them for 2 years now and recently bought a rental building in cash. Needless to say, she's doing very well for herself.\n\nMichael and Andrew just asked me for money. Michael needs $30k for part of a down payment for a townhouse and Andrew wants $10k so he could graduate with no debt. I told them to ask Elisa for money, not me, and that she could easily afford to help them out.\n\nElisa called me the other day asking what I said to her brothers because now they're both asking her for money. I told her what I told them and she yelled at me for \"volunteering\" her to help with her brothers' expenses. I told her that I never said she would help them, I just said that she easily could. She said she doesn't feel comfortable loaning money to family because she doesn't want to risk their relationship if they don't pay her back. I told her it shouldn't be a big deal if they don't pay her back because we know her Christmas bonus will be close to double what her brothers want, plus if she says no she could potentially risk her relationship with her brothers because she can afford it.\n\nShe hung up on me and hasn't spoken to me since then so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1667062882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygouyh/aita_for_telling_my_kids_to_borrow_money_from/", "score": 3510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Apologize to her, and either help or don't help your younger kids, but don't sic them and their demands on her.

You basically reviewed your daughter\u2019s finances and deemed that she can afford to give thousands of dollars to your children\u2026without even speaking to her.

They are individual adults and you no longer have control or oversight over them. Michael and Andrew don\u2019t NEED that money from you or Elisa - they just need to work harder or adjust their expectations.

Bonus points for also putting your relationship with Elisa at risk because she will resent you no matter what decision she makes. Elisa needs to stop telling you how much money she makes.

He will be fine. Michael can figure something else out. Not Elisa's problem.", "YTA. It may seem like logic as she can afford it but it really wasn't your place to direct them to your daughter. A simple no would have sufficed. They know how successful thier is but they came to you to ask. Once you pointed them in her direction, in thier mind it seems like it was good to go to get a loan from her.", "YTA. Your less well off kids need to learn to cut their cloth according to their means. YOU shouldn't have diverted them onto their sister. Learn to say no, and that 'no' is a complete sentence. No need to elaborate or explain, no means no.

Now you've caused family strife.", "YTA Your children asked to borrow money from you. It's a question that requires a yes or no answer.", "YTA volunteered her without asking her then dismissed her genuine concerns saying she can afford to lose the money completely ignoring her point how it would damage her relationship with her siblings if they can't pay.\n\nYou are clearly resentfull of her income and tried to force her I to a situation where she could ruin her relationship with the rest of the family whatever she does.", "YTA.

She has the right idea about not loaning money to family.", "YTA\n\nYou have every right to refuse to loan money to your adult children.

Supporting her adult siblings is not and never will be her responsibility.", "YTA. You don't owe your sons money at this point in life, even if you can afford it.

You're acting like your son needs $200 to feed his family. 40,000 is some people's yearly salary and you think it's no big deal if your daughter doesn't get it back because it's family.

Her money is her business,  not yours.\n\nAlso,  huge important part here,  your sons don't need this money,  they want it.  \n\nLoaning money to family is almost always a bad idea unless the person loaning does not care to get the money back.", "YTA", "YTA hands down, no question... just wtf, you don't want to be the bad guy and say no, so you foist the problem (ie your kids) onto your other kid?", "YTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t have/want to lend them money you do not tell them to ask their sister.

Carmen is a single mom of 2 and works as a nurse. Michael and his wife are teachers and are expecting their first child. Both make around 100k and we live in California near the Bay Area, where 100k is considered low income. \n\nElisa is a nanny for an extremely rich family. I don't know if she's considered live in because she lives in a separate house but on the same property. She makes $250k per year plus bonuses, doesn't pay for rent or utilities, rarely buys groceries because she always eats with the family, they bought her a brand new car, they pay for her gas, maintenance, all of her medical, dental, vision, etc. is 100% paid for by the family. Hell, they even pay for her gym membership and her vacations. She's worked for them for 2 years now and recently bought a rental building in cash. Needless to say, she's doing very well for herself. \n\nMichael and Andrew just asked me for money. Michael needs $30k for part of a down payment for a townhouse and Andrew wants $10k so he could graduate with no debt. I told them to ask Elisa for money, not me, and that she could easily afford to help them out. \n\nElisa called me the other day asking what I said to her brothers because now they're both asking her for money. I told her what I told them and she yelled at me for \"volunteering\" her to help with her brothers' expenses. I told her that I never said she would help them, I just said that she easily could. She said she doesn't feel comfortable loaning money to family because she doesn't want to risk their relationship if they don't pay her back. I told her it shouldn't be a big deal if they don't pay her back because we know her Christmas bonus will be close to double what her brothers want, plus if she says no she could potentially risk her relationship with her brothers because she can afford it. \n\nShe hung up on me and hasn't spoken to me since then so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First, it's not going to last forever, and when it ends, there's no guarantee of picking up another gig with the same income and perks.  And second, she's essentially given up on having a life while she's employed there.  Work here, live here, eat here.  That brand new car is probably owned by them, but she uses it, because...  she drives the kids around.  Those vacations they pay for are probably working vacations for her.  They go to an exotic resort and she comes along... to watch the kids.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great gig if you're up for it, but to disparage her because of her income and perks taken out of context and to insist she has funds available for \"loans\" to the rest of the family.... yeah.

Sounds like he expects the 10K to be a gift. Michael and his wife will still be making 100K and have a house payment, a home to furnish, baby expenses, so how will they repay Elisa?
