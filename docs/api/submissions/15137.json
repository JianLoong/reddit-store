Rather than having a cake, we decided to support a friend of mine\u2019s (also 23F) small business and have a dessert table with various treats. We had been friends since primary school and so I originally planned to have her sit at our head table, but she told me that she preferred to be on the vendor side of things to grow her business. I understood and supported her decision, so I put her in contact with my coordinators and moved her from the guest list to the vendor list.\n\nAt the same time, her boyfriend decided he wanted to get into videography and asked if he could shoot our wedding for exposure/practice (for free). We wanted a short video to send to my family abroad (they couldn\u2019t make it due to geopolitics), so we were delighted to tick off that box.\n\nI thought the wedding had gone beautifully... until I received a long email the next day from my friend about how upset she was with how the wedding unfolded. In her email she said she \u201cfelt incredibly disregarded, left out and even used\u201d. She was upset that she wasn\u2019t seated with all the other guests during the dinner and had no one to talk to (besides her boyfriend) and apparently spent most of the night crying in the bathroom. She also said that if she and her boyfriend were valued that we would have made it a point to check on them to make sure they were taken care of after all the effort they had put in and that it felt as though out of everyone in the room, I cared about them the least.\n\nWhen I received this email, my husband and I were at the airport waiting to leave for our honeymoon, but I replied with an equally long and apologetic response. I had no intention of making her feel so poorly, and I acknowledged that I was a bit scatter-brained (there was a lot going on with over 70 guests and a full schedule). I was unable to be there to accommodate her, and so she was treated as a vendor. In my email I said I wanted to continue as friends, and she replied agreeing and saying that her boyfriend still fully intended on working on the video.\n\n2.5 months later, she has removed me as her follower on insta, and I have not heard from her boyfriend regarding the footage even though I sent a polite email inquiring about it a couple of weeks ago. I also noticed after snooping online that he used a couple of clips from our wedding to promote his business (with our faces in them and all).\n\nI\u2019m known for being overly rational and sometimes emotion-less, but I try my best to understand my friend\u2019s pov.

You can pay for the footage if you want it. You already received enough free of charge. That's After reading both this and the VENDOR'S post.

If that's true, then yes, YTA, and I wouldn't expect any footage until you reach out, ask, and pay for it. \n\nLike\u2026 I get she said she wanted to be on a vendor side... but vendor meals are expected, no?

I'm just so confused about what happened here", "I remembered reading your friend's post in another subreddit. \n\nAfter reading your perspective, I can honestly say that YTA. Even though your friend and her boyfriend were put as vendors, it's expected that vendors attending the reception should be seated at a table. If you can\u2019t afford to seat all the vendors at a table, you should have discussed with them - especially your friend of 10+ years - about the seating arrangement. Your friend described how upset she felt because she basically had to miss most of the reception with her boyfriend, sitting outside in the lobby area and I believe getting their own food.

You should start collecting cell cam pics and footage now to see if you can piece something together. \n\nWe had a cousin who offered to video/photograph my Dads blowout fancy pants birthday dinner.

And then you put her on the vendor side of things and she got upset by that? Was she expecting to be on both the vendor and guest sides?? I'm in the same boat of \"rational rather than emotional\" so maybe that's why I don't see anything hurtful about your actions and decisions, but it sounds like all you did was what she asked you to do. She said she wanted to be on the vendor side, you did that, she got upset over it.\n\nEdit: so people stop commenting on my comment to read the friend's side (I've gotten at least three and this is more efficient than responding to them individually). I'll go read it, it seems like there was a lot that was left out or potentially even lied about in this post. Probably intentionally, seeing as after seeing the friends post, this OP seems to be considered very much in the wrong by everyone.

Unfortunately, when planning the wedding I did not have that same luxury - so I had several coordinators to organize everything for me.

Go visit her when you're in town again.  Go by her work.  Take her out to lunch or dinner.  Her and her boyfriend.  \n\nIf you don't really value the friendship just accept its a wash.

I think it\u2019s overwhelming obvious you messed up. I\u2019m sorry, but you did.", "Okay, thank you for clearing up the financial aspect. However, your friend still got left out of the reception, and her boyfriend did you a huge favour by offering his services for free.  If the roles were reversed, you would probably be just as upset that you're sitting outside of the reception hall with no one to talk to other than your spouse, missing on the speeches, the other guests, etc.\n\nIf you really want to make this friendship stick, you need to talk to her.

Unless you want to go through life as a lonely b%^* who doesn\u2019t understand why people stop being her friend, I strongly encourage you to start working on some serious introspection and self-reflection.

Part of the story is that they were the only vendors at the reception.", "The rooms were adjacent and flowed into one another, the guests were constantly going between them since the bar and other amenities were in that room and the doors were open all night.

The connections were not to be made with other vendors but rather the hotel that the wedding was in - which she did get the chance to do. It was also to showcase her work to the guests to expand her business.", "She was not allowed to be in the room while people were eating, there was no meal for her.  And you told her words to the effect of \"suck it up buttercup, it's my wedding, I don't care if you were treated like a leper.\"", "Well, it was your responsibility to ensure your guests have a place to sit and eat, right? I worked plenty of weddings at a hotel, and we had brides, grooms, parents, planners, etc. come in to make sure everything was set up as expected at some point in time. Maybe you didn't want to set it up physically yourself, but you should have at least made it a point to have SOMEONE set it up. Event planner, staff at the venue? \n\n\nWith this attitude, you wonder why she doesn't want to be your friend anymore? Lol", "Agree with the comment above. Her post explains what you put them through\u2026how can you even call her a friend? Friends don't treat friends that way. Maybe the video was taken in the room where they sat all alone.", "Yikes!  I saw her update. It seems like you lost a friend,\nOP.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/129q96e/my_best_friend_from_childhood_invited_me_to_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "The fact that you\u2019re more upset about the wedding footage than the loss of a 10+ year friendship is really telling. YTA", "You invited her, and then gave her nowhere to sit.  You told her she could sit  at the vendor's table, but you had no vendor's table.   If this isn't fake, how can you not be the asshole?", "WHAT", "Rubbish. You were in on the seating chart. A wedding coordinator, even one who is a friend, doesn\u2019t know everyone invited and the dynamics of who can and cannot be sat together. YTA still.", "Do you think that sitting outside of the reception room counts as \"a place to sit\"? If you cared about your friend, you would've made sure she had an actual seat. But you just saw her as another vendor, so who cares how they get treated, right?", "Dude she came to you about not having a seat and you blew her off. You also didn\u2019t actually hire anyone. Just squeezed your friends. Supporting your friends is one thing. Taking advantage is a whole other thing", "YTA.    What bride and groom do not sit down together and make up a seating chart where the guests sit?\nShe and boyfriend should have been at at a table in the same room as all guests", "Which part of her story was false?\n\nHer story rings true mostly because it explains why she would throw away a ten year friendship over the incident.", ">when I have the opportunity.\n\nI mean, this certainly aligns with her version of events.\n\nTo that end, your story hinges on you being \"scatterbrained\" and not managing the situation for that reason... so I would be very, very cautious, if you do value this relationship, about telling her she has her facts wrong. You might not be right about that. It seems like you generally missed a lot of details on this one.", "I don\u2019t trust your POV. You found out thru Reddit that there was no vendor table.", "Everything she said basically matches up with your post, but she stately it without trying to sugarcoat or gloss over stuff like you did in your post.", "Oh yeah, I'm sure you'll bother to get around to it sometime...\n\n\nYou sound very self centered.", "Maybe just leave her alone. From her post, you are not a worthwhile friend to her. You got whatever link to the video on his website. Leave them alone. You're not magically going to become a better friend at this point. She sees who you are and how you have treated her over a period of time, and it's not acceptable to her. If that friendship actually meant anything to you, you wouldn't have constantly blown her off. \n\nYTA for being a disappointing friend.", "Tried\u2026 because they have footage you want\u2026", "She said you visit the area often. Was that a lie?", "So you treated her like \u201cThe Help\u201d. YTA", "Unless they are also friends doing you a big favour at cost or free.", "I know, I am pointing out that by doing the bare minimum I treated total strangers better than she treated friends.", "Just admit you used her. Come on now, we all see it.", "That\u2019s not believable.  You aren\u2019t doing someone a favor by letting them work for free, no matter how important you might feel you are.  And this was a small wedding, it\u2019s even less believable that he would get anything worthwhile out of hours of free labor.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t pay him.  You treated them poorly.  You aren\u2019t entitled to the fruits of his labor, no way.", "Your friend said you told them the wedding was overbudget prior to engaging their services, is this untrue?", "It\u2019s not a \u201cvendors\u201d table if they were the only ones seated there. Where was your wedding coordinator? If it had a perfect view and was so comfortable you know\u2026", "Ohhh, okay that makes more sense.  I couldn't understand why this would make anyone so mad.", "so there was never any reason not to seat her with the guests, then. The \"vendor table\" was always just her and her BF.", "I'm not sure where you're getting this information - but I did no such thing. She had a seat and a meal - although yes, it was in an adjacent room where the bar was. I did not say anything disrespectful.", ">Yikes!  I saw her update. It seems like you lost a friend, OP.\n\nYup... it explains the unanswered calls.", "Especially when she didn\u2019t even hire the boyfriend. He volunteered.", "There should have been a vendor's table - and I acknowledge it was a gross oversight that there wasn't one.", "Yes. Look at the friends post. It\u2019s linked to the top comment.", "Don't worry, there was apparently an open door. Same/same.", "Her story also rings true because the details of both match. Lol.", "I'm not intentionally trying to sugar coat of gloss over anything, but at my wedding I have to say that my perspective was quite different. I was definitely wearing rose tinted glasses (as you'd expect to be given the circumstance), and was not by any means trying to be malicious.", "I live over 3000km away and so as much as it sounds like I won't get around to it - I cannot foresee the future when I will be in town and able to see them. I do fully intend on making it up to her.", "I don't constantly blow her off - but yes, I am extremely busy. But I'm still the one who initiates any kind of dialogue and plans - I've always been that person. People do grow, but if not given the opportunity, you're stunting both people's personal development.", "I visit about twice a year - once for new years and then once in the summer when I get some time off (never pre-planned) for about a week at a time each. You tell me - is that often?", "She was fully paid for services that she wanted to do and refused the invitation as a guest. I didn't want to undermine her authority as a business woman by treating her differently in front of the other vendors since her goal was to grow her business.", "I wasn't the one to come up with this - they had pitched the idea to me. He offered his services for free - I did not ask for them. If he had asked to be paid - we would have arranged something suitable.", "Yes, that is untrue - we do not discuss finances with friends.", "That\u2019s cuz you treated her like shit", "Have you even considered an honest apology instead of accusing your invited guest of extortion?", "But you didn't care enough to make sure she had a seat or notice she was missing? Or include her name with the long list of other friends?", "Well, if you're constantly not showing up, I wouldn't be reaching out to you either. I don't doubt the validity of her post. If you're too busy to show up when you make plans with her, that's on you, and it doesn't matter that you're busy. It's still a lousy friendship that she doesn't want. \n\nOn the off chance you really are trying to make amends, actually take responsibility for your actions. I can guarantee she's not interested in hearing about your busy life or how hectic that year of not showing up was.", "You said you moved her as a guest. I remember her post now. It was a surprise to her that she was no longer a guest. A wedding also isn\u2019t the place for sales pitches", "according to your friend, that's not what happened. you told her if she brought a plus one then she couldn't sit at the head table. so she had to sit at the vendors table. \n\nYTA without a doubt.", "According to her post, she was unpaid, and her boyfriend wasn't included on the original invite because the wedding was over budget. When he agreed to do free video work, she was removed from the head table by you. She had no seat or food for the reception and was left in a room separate from anyone. YTA and a horrible friend. It looks like you wanted to use them for freebies, not include them as friends in any way. You're reaping what you've sown.", "You said that you are known for being unemotional but you are reacting emotionally here because what you want is being thwarted.  I get that you really want the video.  But you didn\u2019t pay for it or provide any consideration for it - the footage doesn\u2019t belong to you (unless you have a contract stating otherwise), so you are asking a favor from someone who feels that you treated them poorly.  \n\nYou really aren\u2019t the victim here.", "The vendor (not friend) stated you in fact did NOT pay her. Also stated there was no vendor table there's a lot of things not adding up here.", "Do you by any chance remember any identifiable part of the post I could search it by? It might be helpful for me to see her pov to resolve any outstanding issues. And I wasn't trying to promote my business, she was promoting hers.", "But no table. Shameful", "That is not true, she could have chosen to not be a vendor - it was entirely her choice, she was welcome as a guest.", "I did in fact pay her - fully. I did not organize the vendor table, the coordinators should have done that - but I realize now that may not have happened, which is a huge disappointment.", "OP, the link is posted now in the top comment. There was no vendor table. Your friend and her boyfriend sat in a separate room by themselves and missed out on most of your wedding.", "She didn\u2019t say that. I mean she made a point of saying MIL didn\u2019t send her an invite.", "If that's the case then you should definitely try reaching out and explaining that the loss of this friendship saddens  you. Best of luck OP", "The rooms opened into a single space, the doors separating them were open the whole night.", "That was the \"engagement party\" - which was held at an annual cottage trip for my husband's mother and her friends from university - my own parents weren't even there. it was NOT a legitimate engagement party."]}
