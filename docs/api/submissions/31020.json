But I guess it depends on your group dynamics, in my group (years ago when I was in uni) whoever was playing DD on the day usually has to \"take care\" of the rest of the group. I know it's easy to say \"we're all adults and everyone must take care of themselves\", but let's face the facts, when people are drinking (I assume binge drinking?) and maybe some weed smoking then likely people aren't making the most rational decisions and are not in the greatest state and someone needs to be there to be the adult (which is also why you guys have a designated driver, because you understand that alcohol impairs driving ability, well it impairs other abilities too). I think for the rest of your friend group, this role is implied when you're all out drinking but it doesn't apply on your DD nights, so maybe people feel they cannot drink as much as they want on your nights because there's no sober person in the group. I've never tried any drugs but I do know that when people were doing LSD etc they usually had 1 person in the group who doesn't take any to \"babysit\" and that's usually a role that rotates within the group.

Depending on where everybody lives it could be quite a significant expense which isn't their fault.", "If you're getting so drunk that it's a safety issue even outside of driving, you shouldn't get drunk.", "That had not occurred to me. Thanks for posting your perspective.", "They do get better parking spots. /s", "My partner is considering taking a Tuesday-Saturday role. I couldn\u2019t imagine if she told me I couldn\u2019t be doing anything fun on Saturday, but I feel like we\u2019ll see a story on this sub of someone trying to do that.", "Idk, if you can\u2019t withhold one night (whether you SAY you can or not) you\u2019re probably an alcoholic", "Lol so true", "Wilder take, adults get to decide what they do with their worthless lives, not you", "Nah I prefer the \"you could drink, just pay for an Uber too\".", "I disagree. DD = Designated Driver . No more than that, unless agreed to. \n\nMost friend groups don\u2019t have DDs if Ubers are available. Seems like just a money saving initiative to avoid Ubers.", "Yeah, that seems like the easy answer.  Anyone who wants to drink on their night has to be responsible for the arrangements.  Rather than it being a DD night, a designated person is responsible for soberly getting everyone home.  If someone chooses to save money and drive their own car, great that's a wonderful solution.  If anyone else chooses not to drive but makes appropriate other arrangements, also great, right?", "Most are", "Yep, It\u2019s college student behaviour. Grow up and learn to manage your alcohol.", "Because it's cheaper than taxis or Ubers, if you're young without much money and don't live within walking distance it's much cheaper for someone to drive. That's why we had a DD, it wasn't to babysit everyone.", "Than more than one person would have a problem with what OP does, so it\u2019s obviously not that.", "Jesus it\u2019s not hard to tell the dynamics. More than one person would have a problem if that was the case, it\u2019s very obviously not.", "They do get to make that choice, I fully support people getting as fucked up as they want. They can\u2019t get fucked up and guilt their friend for choosing to do the same instead babysitting them", "Right?! All these comments about OP needing or being expected to babysit their drunk friends are crazy! If you\u2019re expecting someone who is visually impaired to a point that they cannot drive to keep track of multiple people in a possibly crowded area with maybe bad lighting(idk if these are bars or clubs or what, but either could have low light and different areas for smokers, dancing, food service, etc) you\u2019re already lost. Everyone keeps track of themselves at the bar, DD makes sure everyone gets back to their own home safely; which can include not going home with rando\u2019s, but being expected to keep an at a on your friends on a night out of wild.", "also, OP is PAYING money for the DD night, his friends arent paying on theirs.", "\"If you want to drink on your DD night, you too can pay for our uber -- you're required to get us home legally and safely, not specifically drive us home.\"", "\"It's not fair that you don't HAVE to pay to get everyone home safe, whether you drink or not\"", "Also suggest that the friend is more than welcome to pay for Ubers for the group like you do if they want to drink and make sure everyone gets home safely.", "That's almost too nice LMAO\n\n\"It's not fair I can drink on the nights I pay for uber? It's also not fair that you can see clearly everyday but here we are\"", "Or, say \"pay for an Uber/taxi for everyone on *your* DD nights if you want to drink\"", "Or offer to not drink on those nights if they poke their own eyes out.", "If you need a babysitter while drinking, you should not be drinking", "Yea I mean my friends and I carpooled but the was before Uber. Then it was cabs. So then we all drank lol. And just split at all.", "Yes and? What would be the point of not drinking if OP is ubering? Being miserable in solidarity? That\u2019s nonsense", "They probably aren't legally blind they just can't drive. For example in the UK to drive you need 6/12 corrected eyesight or better (fifth line on a Snellen chart), legally blind is that you can't read the top letter without moving half the distance.", "Yeah, what we really don't know here is the common behavior of this group. Is this a group where everyone has a tendency to get out of control and needs someone sober along to keep things in line? Or is this all a bunch of casual drinkers who probably aren't much over the limit and just want to be safe and not risk an OWI. Very different dynamics.", "They can if that's the social contract they established. You're presuming they didn't. That's what the INFO person is asking and what you, and many others, seem to be misunderstanding.\n\nEven if this isn't the case, you can't have it both ways. Your wild take is that they shouldn't be drinking if they get fucked up, but your second take is that you support them getting fucked up.\n\nEither you believe in a society where people can choose to get completely blasted to the point they need supervision or not. You can hold a separate opinion about whether or not they should supply their own supervision through DD.\n\nIn any case, I want to know your position so I can better understand it. Could you answer a few questions for me?\n\n1) Should people in society be allowed to get drunk to the point of needing supervision?\n\n2) If a group of people agrees to have one person be that supervision, is the person designated morally obligated to follow that agreement?", "I really wish these had a follow up post.", "Yeah this. NTA.", "I would just ignore the guy. He sounds like an idiot.", "I mean, I\u2019d discuss it with someone who is driving, but not with just others in the group.", "But we do know the dynamic. If that was expected more than one person would have a problem with what OP does.", "I'm the friend whose eyes don't work. \n\nMy home tends to be the central meet-up spot. I often order the Ubers for the group on nights out. It's my pleasure to do so. We all get to imbibe if we want to. No one has ever demanded or complained. I also tend to have a fondness for buying a huge takeaway pizza to bring home and share at the end of the night. My home is always a safe space for friends to sleep off their drinks.\n\nWe buy each other rounds and share food. We just don't really keep tabs.\n\nI definitely can't drive my friends around, but I can and do contribute to the friendships in other ways. We all have fun, which is the ultimate goal. I'm really not sure why OPs friend is taking such an issue. NTA", "Maybe they are just happy not to drink on every occasion the go out. Maybe they are worried about OP drinking on every occasion they go out?", "\"I'm more jealous that you have the option to drive or pay for uber. Now shut up and buy me a beer\"", "An even sadder disability", "Exactly! Epilepsy here too. Unfortunately it's highly doubtful I'll ever be controlled enough. Especially because one of my partials is a paralyzed hand. Oof. I'm super glad you managed to get yours back!", "because it's cheaper. any other dumb questions?", "there would be nothing to over analyze if the \u201carrangement between friends\u201d was working well\u2026 clearly it isn\u2019t, considering that op presented a conflict that arose due to the arrangement, then asked us to give our opinions on said arrangement lol", "If you're out drinking at bars, there is a sizeable amount of disposable income involved", "I don't get it. What's the reference?", "Need to clarify with all members of the group.\nMuch different than college or frat days. \nMy take is if someone needs protection from getting blind drunk, they need to work on that themselves.", "I'm shocked I had to scroll this far to see this.  Change it from designated driver night to responsible sober adult night and I would say OP is TA.  Maybe everyone is only having two or three drinks but if they are taking turns getting hammered then having a sober person around is important.", "When in college (1960s) I was always designated sober person for my friends parties. That is, until I used my cassette tape recorder to record what went on at the party. When I played it back the next day they all stood over me while I erased it because they didn't believe what they had done", "sure, but they say they go regularly. If you spend no money one 1/5th of the time that could be a bit.", "\u201cCan\u2019t see\u201d.", "Ooh, not having had children this is the 1st time I get to be called the \"grandparent\". Thank you for the chuckle.", "How do you know they're required to participate and don't do it voluntarily? I'm sure their friends would be fine with either OP or bitter friend arranging their own transportation to and from the bar every night they go out and never DDing and just meeting them there."]}
