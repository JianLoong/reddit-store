But I guess it depends on your group dynamics, in my group (years ago when I was in uni) whoever was playing DD on the day usually has to \"take care\" of the rest of the group. I know it's easy to say \"we're all adults and everyone must take care of themselves\", but let's face the facts, when people are drinking (I assume binge drinking?) and maybe some weed smoking then likely people aren't making the most rational decisions and are not in the greatest state and someone needs to be there to be the adult (which is also why you guys have a designated driver, because you understand that alcohol impairs driving ability, well it impairs other abilities too). I think for the rest of your friend group, this role is implied when you're all out drinking but it doesn't apply on your DD nights, so maybe people feel they cannot drink as much as they want on your nights because there's no sober person in the group. I've never tried any drugs but I do know that when people were doing LSD etc they usually had 1 person in the group who doesn't take any to \"babysit\" and that's usually a role that rotates within the group.

My whole life it\u2019s been your own responsibility to get home safe and not drive drunk. Its one thing if you\u2019re in a location where cabs, Ubers, or walking is not an option fine, but if I have that option I would just pay my own way home. It\u2019s my responsibility to get a cab home if I\u2019m to drunk to drive, not my friend\u2019s responsibility to stay sober to drive us home. This being said if I had to stay sober for whatever reason like picking up my wife or kid later I\u2019d gladly drive my buddies home but would never just expect that returned, I\u2019d just cab home like an adult if I didn\u2019t get a lift.", "This", "Maybe, I claim they have an unhealthy relationship with people because of their jealousy.\n\nA person who is this blind to the fact that OP is blind and harps on envy towards the person who is paying for their ride is simply not a good person.

Reddit equates Fair with Transactional way too much.", "There's nothing wrong with a free. Theres also nothing wrong with OP wanting to take their turn. Friendship isn't transactional but part of friendship is feeling like you're not taking advantage of friends and part of friendship is letting people do things for you. If OP feels better about paying for ubers when it would be their turn, it's perfectly fine for them to do so and it's perfectly fine for OPs friends to accept OPs generosity.  Thankfully I don't have a disability but I can imagine if I was in OPs shoes I'd want to do something to feel like I was contributing.

Which is actually transactional. Why put effort into a relationship if it isn\u2019t repaid. Why show respect when it isn\u2019t shown back?", "Of course friendships are transactional. They help you out, you help them out. If someone just never does anything that would be weird. \n\nPaying for a uber, getting your wife/parents to pick you up, or DDing are all interchangable to me. You're pitching in either way", "OP is fine paying for ubers. What's the problem? \n\nLook at it this way- it's an Uber rotation. Everyone takes a turn paying for ubers. Occasionally, instead of paying for ubers though, some of the friends choose to drive everyone and not drink because they'd rather save the money occasionally. Should OP not participate in the Uber rotation because they don't have the option to drive instead?", "So I get that you're well intentioned here, but you also have to consider how the OP might feel, as well as disabled folks in general. You can only get  \"oh you don't have to help we'll take care of it\" without it starting to grate.\n\nThen those people just start unconsciously avoiding you because they start calculating that into the scale of inviting you. Or maybe they don't, but you always have to wonder if they are.    \n\n\nIt's a careful balance between \"not having to ask for help\" and \"always being treated like an invalid\". In this case, OP seems to have found a way to equally contribute that they're comfortable with, so let them do so.", "I mentioned it in a comment, but usually it's just going out to sports bars to watch the local hockey team every other week or so.
