You were informing him that he would have to take over one childcare duty and you are right that it really isn't optional for him.", "Oh no, he will have to be a parent and pick up his kids. How awful that you didn\u2019t beg him to do it and praise his willingness to be adaptable and supportive but only after you entreated him to do it. \n\nIs he 12? Does he view your children the same as dirty laundry? \n\nNTA. He sounds exhausting.

These are his children, he is a parent, it is not a favor to you that he is going to be a parent when the other parent is unavailable. You didn\u2019t ask rudely or disrespectfully. It\u2019s clear he sees this as YOUR job and your tasks and therefore does not feel invested in it.", "NTA. Does he not understand fundamental parental responsibilities. If you're not getting them, then he has to.", "NTA, he's being to sensitive and it appears he just didn't want to do it.

Asking someone means they can say 'yes' or 'no'.  He can't say no.  This was a *reminder* since it's an unusual thing for him to do.", "  \nEDIT NTA this isn't ordering him around, you're problem solving. It would be better for him to get over this hangup where he as to be asked every time. What? Is he going to say no?

It wasn\u2019t a request, nor a demand. It was a reminder.

I am not sure what my judgement is... maybe NAH for now. Are you usually quite kind in the way you communicate with each other? What else is going on at home? Is there a pattern of being a bit short or impatient with each other right now?", "What if he came home from work and said \"Make me dinner\" instead of asking you to make it?\n\nEven if that was your regular responsibility, you really wouldn't like being told to do so in such a manner.

Heaven forbid he have to parent for a day.", "This is why, when both parents work, it should fall to BOTH to split child duties.

This demand to be asked to do something that is already part of his parental responsibility can be a tool of manipulation.  Think about why he wants to be asked.

If they didn\u2019t have this argument then the school/daycare would be calling wondering why no one has picked them up.  They would\u2019ve called OP not DH.
