It will also help her to avoid further accumulation of damage to her body.", "NTA: absolutely understand why she was embarrassed and upset. But it sounds like she\u2019s at least 75+ lbs overweight.

This is problematic and OP should not feed into that narrative. Many commentators are saying what doctors do sometimes by ignoring other things - that is not the issue here. This situation is her ignoring things to be aware of that might be an issue because of her obesity.

I have had so many health problems that limit me so much, and losing 60 lbs has opened up a new world of possibilities for me in terms of not being in pain and exhausted, so I can actually spend my time and energy doing things I enjoy. She might feel ok now but it takes a few years to catch up to you. Pointing out the health risks of obesity isn\u2019t saying she\u2019s unattractive or a bad person.

In fact, it's dangerous. You offered useful interventions and offered to assist her in adopting a more healthy lifestyle, and you did it kindly.\n\nETA: Yes, I'm aware that prejudice against fat people doesn't necessarily equate to \"fear of.\" But that is how we use the suffix -phobia now.

I made it into my mid-40s with no health issues that are typically tied to being overweight.  Let's just say the Trump admin and the pandemic raised my blood pressure.  Happily, my GP is one of the good ones and didn't harp on my weight.

As someone whose weight has undergone dramatic changes (pregnancy, menopause) my take is this: doctors are responsible to inform their patients about the risks of lifestyle choices. This includes but is not limited to smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and improper diet and exercise (too much or too little of either). You wouldn\u2019t want a doctor to ignore an anorexic patient, so why would you want them to ignore one that\u2019s severely overweight?\n\nOnce any possible medical conditions are ruled out - and that\u2019s a significant step that should always happen first - then it\u2019s perfectly appropriate to suggest lifestyle changes. We all learned in kindergarten that exercise is important, so if someone isn\u2019t doing any kind of physical activity, they need to start. It\u2019s common sense. If someone is eating like crap, they\u2019ll probably feel like crap, so why wouldn\u2019t you want to feel better?\n\nNTA. Suggesting walks and offering to cook is a loving gesture. OP\u2019s girlfriend can victimize herself into hypertension, diabetes, and sore joints if she wishes. It\u2019s not a hundred percent certain that she\u2019ll have serious health issues as she ages, but a hella lot of people quit smoking before they got chronic bronchitis, emphysema and cancer.", "NTA. Many people are ridiculously in denial about the health impact of obesity. It killed my husband at least 20 years before his time. \n\nSuggesting a stage 2 obese woman whose husband  was worried about her weight was not a bad person to be worried and that discussing a weight loss plan with her doctor would be a  good  idea was enough to get me banned from one subreddit entirely. Apparently  we are all supposed to pretend obesity is irrelevant.", "YTA.  She went for something.  Doctor didn't listen.  Women everywhere fight this every day, regardless of weight.

Sometimes they\u2019re looking for commiseration.", "I agree with this as well. Doctors are not trying to flirt and lie everything is fine if someone's weight is threatening their health. They do their job and bring up the difficult topic no one else may not be able to talk about.

OP's girlfriend acted like the doctors messages or concerns weren't valid and that they only said it to scare her. This is a defense mechanism. Doctors don't tell you things to scare you, they tell you things to be aware of that you might be at risk for. OPs gf not taking this seriously and instead thinking the doctor is trying to scare her is not a thinking pattern one should support / defend. They are things to worry about and perhaps there are things she needs to be consciously aware of.", "But the doctor was telling her about the health risks associated with obesity and asked about diet, that\u2019s his job isn\u2019t it?

OP has offered to exercise and cook with her to support her, but he\u2019s been labelled as fat phobic which is grossly unfair and untrue.\n\nYou can be healthy and overweight I suppose but being obese isn\u2019t healthy in the long run.

It goes both ways. It's a conversation that needs tact but needs to be had. It's our job as doctors to point out evidence based medicine and what is healthiest for the patient.  If they chose to accept it fine if not fine , at the end of the day it's your life but this vilification for doctors doing their actual damn job is getting beyond ridiculous imo.", "I am not overweight and I have never been overweight so I have never experienced this first hand but I do know how society treats people perceived as fat. Fuck, I grew up in the 90s where a size 6 was treated as practically morbidly obese. \n\nI also know that weight is not as black and white as we as a society have been taught. In fact, studies have shown being slightly overweight can actually have some health benefits. I know that doctors routinely ignore health problems of women, but especially women of colour and women who are overweight. I have had my own health concerns ignored several times or been treated poorly by doctors and I am a relatively healthy person. \n\nI also know weight gain and loss if not as simple as we'd like it to be. I am not here to post any judgement but to support all those who are struggling with how people are treating them. Before you judge become more educated. There are a lot of resources out there. One example is the podcast Maintenance Phase, which examines popular health trends and myths.
