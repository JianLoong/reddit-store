Everything went great and, this Wednesday, she was cleared to travel back home.\n\nMy family decided to host a dinner to celebrate MIL's successful procedure, with my wife (39F) and our 14-year-old son assisting in the preparations. My son, who's passionate about learning to cook, took charge of making the main dish \u2013 a chicken recipe he had been practicing. It was us, FIL and MIL, my wife's brother (30sM) and sister (25ishF).\n\nMy BIL used to be a professional chef, but his restaurant went under with the pandemic. This will be important later. He decided to help my son plate his chicken. Apparently it was a little dry, so they baptized it \"Sahara chicken.\"\n\nAs we gathered around the table to enjoy the meal, my son proudly presented the chicken he had cooked. It was a big moment for him, and I could see the excitement and nervousness in his eyes. The chicken tasted amazing and everyone told him so. My BIL, on the other hand, said something along the lines of \"Trust the pro. This was the tastiest sand I've ever ate.\" Everyone, including my son, laughed it off, thinking it was all in good fun.\n\nBut I couldn't find it amusing. My protective instincts kicked in, and I lashed out at my brother-in-law, asking since when he was a pro at sand, because he no longer was a professional cook. BIL laughed, but I could see I had touched a sore spot and it created an uncomfortable atmosphere at the dinner table. \n\nBoth my wife and my son later told me they think I was out of line. My son says that I ruined what was supposed to be celebration. My wife told me the occasion was about her mother, not our son's chicken and even he was making fun of the \"Sahara chicken\", so I made things awkward over nothing.\n\nReflecting on the situation, I'm torn. On one hand, I wanted to stand up for my son, who had worked hard on the meal and, well, if you can't take a joke, don't make one. On the other hand, maybe I overreacted, and my response was out of proportion. I'm wondering if I should have just let the comments slide and not let them ruin the celebration.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for my reaction or was I right to defend my son's cooking during this special dinner?", "created_utc": 1699123482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ns9g0/aita_for_ruining_a_celebration_dinner_over_a_joke/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lots of really good restaurants went under during the pandemic, and I assume that you, as a man, realise that many people set great stock in their professional success. To attack his ego in a way that was neither funny nor related to the situation but clearly aimed to diminish him and hurt and was utterly unnecessary.\n\nChildren aren't made out of porcelain. If you kid can take a joke, good for him! Shows he's got real confidence.\n\nDon't ruin it for him by jumping down everyone's throat who doesn't put him on a pedestral. That's actually what many children are embarrassed about. Also, what a great sport that he had the balls to tell you that himself. He seems very mature. Listen to him.", "YTA. Now it's all good and well to stand up for your son, but you said he took it in stride and wasn't off put by the remark. If it looked like it made him feel uncomfortable or upset, but he was just remaining quiet because he's young or wanted to keep the peace it would have been fine to step in. That doesn't seem to be the case though. You created an issue out of nothing and then blew it up. Your statement also didn't seem like a joke. It just seemed like a malicious remark meant to hurt.", "So your kid\u2019s chicken was tasty, but dry\u2026and even he was joining in on the joke, and you decided to throw a zinger about what is probably a seriously painful death of his dream, through no fault of his own. \n\nIt\u2019s nasty and very targeted. And instead of standing up for your son, you look like a malicious asshole.\n\nYTA", "I think you handled it poorly.  Your BIL was an ass, but everyone, except you, laughed it off.\n\nIf you wanted a confrontation, you should have done it in private with your BIL, not at the dinner table.  You elevated the issue to where it got the attention it did not deserve.\n\nBut kudos for standing up for your son and be justifiably proud.  Just use more tact if there is a next time.\n\nSo, YTA.  Good intentions, poor execution.", "It was a joke\n\"They\" named it Sahara chicken\nI think you know\nYta", "YTA...yep, you over-reacted.", "YTA- it seems like your son was not upset by it so why ruin the whole dinner over it?", "YTA. But only because you took the bait. \n\n\u201cAww, Son I think you did a great job. Delicious.\u201d\n\nYour BIL is a pompous ass who should check himself, but that\u2019s a him problem.", "Soft YTA because I get you wanted to defend your child. Also, I don't know your son, so maybe he's sensitive.\n\n**However**, he doesn't seem to be sensitive going by your story. It sounds like there was some light hearted ribbing, which he joined in with and didn't mind. Also, as he sincerely wants to learn to cook and isn't very sensitive, he probably wants genuine feedback and this could have been an interesting learning moment for him. But you took that away by being overly defensive, and what you said really was spiteful...that guy's dream went down in flames during a pandemic no one could have predicted.\n\nAgain, if your kid had been humiliated or upset, I'd totally understand your reaction. But it seems to me that the person who made it awkward was you.", "Soft YTA - I love your instinct to defend your child. My parents wouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026so I\u2019m a little envious. Next time, however, take your cues from your son. He\u2019s old enough to indicate when he needs your help.", "YTA - If your son laughed it off, then you should have too", "Look, you\u2019re not an AH for standing up for your son. But you did it the wrong way. Instead of lashing out (YTA for that), you should have said \u201cBIL, as a professional chef, do you have any tips for Son so he can avoid drying out the chicken next time he cooks it?\u201d That way you still encourage your son, plus you get him some tips. You also could have snuck in \u201cformer professional\u201d if you wanted to rankle BIL, but it\u2019s not his fault his restaurant closed. \n\nHe did compliment your son\u2019s cooking, after all, even if he did it in kind of a rude way. \n\nYou should ask your BIL to apologize to your son for calling it \u201csand\u201d in front of everyone though. Even if your son laughed it off, it probably hurt. (But before you do that, apologize to BIL for what *you* said.)", "A soft YTA, though really don't AH is a good fit for you. I can understand getting your feathers ruffled on your son's behalf.\n\nBut then, your BIL is definitely an AH. As a \"professional\", he knew exactly how biting that comment was. He's no damn Gordon Ramesy", "ESH. BIL for criticizing a 14 year old\u2019s cooking. You for not addressing it without insulting BIL. I think BIL is the bigger AH but you could\u2019ve chosen a different way to address his comment.", "ESH - more lightly toward you. Your BIL should have been more kind to a teenager trying to learn to cook and, as opposed to making fun of his efforts, he could have offered some actual advice how to do better next time. You, on the other hand, could have spoken to your BIL privately about what he did, since it looked like people were trying to not make a scene about it during the actual dinner. However, I do applaud you for standing up for your kid against your BIL bullying a child.", "ESH. Your BIL was an AH but you overreacted and made it about you. If your son was cool you shouldn't have escalated the situation.", "ESH. \n\nBIL shouldn\u2019t have made that joke, and it\u2019s good you want to defend your sons cooking, but if he doesn\u2019t want you to do that, you\u2019re in the wrong. \n\nAlso just  heads up, sometimes people who are learning something new and are passionate about it want to hear when they did something not up to par by people who know better. It\u2019s part of the learning experience. Your son sounds like he will go far if he can take his mistakes in good humor as he works to improve on his cooking skills. You should encourage that mentality.", "ESH. You overreacted, but maybe BIL will learn to not make fun of your children. \n\nHumour should punch up, not down.", "[deleted]", "Probably against the grain but I'm going NTA. You're not wrong for showing your son that you've got his back. Even if it was completely in jest (it wasn't) BIL's public putdown was unnecessary. Constructive feedback in private about overcooking/drying stuff out and how to avoid it? Sure. Public embarrassment? Nope.", "I am torn but I will say NTA because your BIL shouldn't have pointed out how dry the chicken was that your son made, at least not dubbing it Sahara chicken. I can imagine exactly what happened and it is not as mean as most things on this subreddit, but pointing out the flaw was still mean.", "NTA. Can't take a joke don't make one. It was only awkward because he got sensitive and couldn't take what he dish (and I guess he dishes nothing now that he doesn't have a restuarant). \n\nYour son is 14, him wanting to be non-confrontational is not his fault. You could've been more diplomatic about the situation, but BIL also could have not said what he said.", "I don't care what you said to anyone. I do know that you are one hell of a protective father.", "ESH\n\nYeah it's just all bad. But I do feel like you did blow up which wasn't really called for. If your son isn't upset then it really isn't an issue. But BIL was obviously insecure about it and said something unnecessary.", "That was a-holy in the extreme comparing the dinner to sand. omg. \n\nOnly your jealous and attention seeking BIL is TA here.
