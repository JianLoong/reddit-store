We paired up through mutual friends and we are mostly very compatible. Recently, we\u2019ve started working out together as something fun and healthy to do together. So since I\u2019m lifting more, my metabolism is going insane.  I\u2019m taking in like 4000 calories or more to feel satisfied.\n\nHere\u2019s why I might be TA. My roommate meal preps every Friday for his week (He\u2019s a retail manager and his workweek is Sunday to Thursday). On Friday, we worked out in the morning and I had a steak and egg burrito + my usual smoothie. I went to work, but was stuck in meetings the whole day so I didn\u2019t have time to eat until we met with friends for dinner. I had a salad and prawns to start + fajitas for the main. When we got back, we had sex (which isn\u2019t relevant at all but does explain why else I would be so hungry) and then he went to sleep but I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was starving. It\u2019s the middle of the night. The only thing we have that\u2019s quick are his meals. And I ate until I felt full. \n\nThe next day, he woke me up stressed about the meals, and I told him what I had done. All he could say was, what the fuck is wrong with me? He started freaking out and crying, and I offered to buy him lunch for the week. He didn\u2019t accept that, called me a selfish AH and just left the house.\n\nIs this really that big a deal?\n\nEdit/Update: Okay! I hear you all loud and clear! I am a giant asshole! I just assumed that buying him takeout would suffice for my fuckup. I looked up what y\u2019all were saying about safe foods and what all that entails for people with EDs. Didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t an easy fix. I\u2019m stubborn and arrogant and I know that. I\u2019m in therapy, please shut up about it. I still don\u2019t see why so many of you are so hung up on the fact that we\u2019re fwb but whatever. I\u2019m going to apologize and find out how he\u2019d like me to fix it.

What don't you go grocery shopping and buy yourself some food?", "YTA. You ate things of his that he had bought, prepared, and set aside for himself. There is no reason you should be so hungry that your need for a quick meal supersedes his ability to eat his own food. You ARE a selfish asshole. You stole from him. You KNEW it was meal prepped FOR HIM, and you probably ate more than A single meal, if you ate until you 'felt full'. You're piggish. And rude. Make your own goddamn food. Or order something, ffs. What is wrong with you? Your mother would be so disappointed.", "YTA. What you did is called stealing. He spent time, money, and energy into meal prepping for HIMSELF. It\u2019s not his problem that you aren\u2019t accounting for the extra calories you need.", "Major YTA. Jesus man. He spent time making food for the entire week, possibly to meet some specific nutritional goals, and you mowed it all down without a thought? That\u2019s possibly the rudest thing I can think of.", "Don't steal his food. If you really needed to eat something or you wouldn't be able to sleep, you should've ordered. YTA", "YTA Explain how you think you might not be? you took something that is not yours because you are hungry", "YTA. \n\n\"I undid several hours of someone's work, left them without meals and brushed it off like it was nothing, AITA?\"\n\nJeez are you really that unaware? Even my dog knows not to take other people's food. And it sounds like you didn't stop at just one meal either - totally unnecessary.", "Is it a big deal you stole his food?  YTA and a thief.", "YOU ATE FIVE OUT OF SEVEN MEALS!!! Those meals are prepped because he\u2019s recovering from and eating disorder!!!! You\u2019re a horrifically awful person when you\u2019re recovering from an ED it\u2019s terrifying to eat food you\u2019ve not prepared so it\u2019s not easy to just deal with you buying meals for him. It\u2019s not even like it was just one you went and fucking inhaled almost all of them. YTA if you\u2019re eating 4000 cal a day you need to have snacks in", "YTA, if you know you need such an insane amount of calories and your roomie needs less doesn't mean you're entitled to literally steal his food. Why don't you have food/snacks in the house for unforeseen situations like these? I probably need half of your caloric intake but I always have either snacks or easy food to cook case I get really hungry.  \n\n\nEdit: holy crap, now I just saw your comment that you ate 5 of his meals, FIVE. So let me get this straight: he works as a retail manager, Sun-Thu which means he's probably meal prepping on Fri/Sat and on Fri night you decided to eat 2 days' worth of his meals...and on top of it all, you only offer to buy him lunch aka only one meal!!", "YTA.  Ask before you take or consume something  that belongs to someone else.", "Very much YTA. If you're hungry, prep yourself some food, don't take someone else's without their express permission. You didn't even ask, you just helped yourself as if you were somehow entitled to their food", "YTA.  You're full of excuses. You know you're hungry more, but you've made no plans for it.  You didn't shop, you didn't prep, you didn't order out. What you did was steal his hard work, his food and throw money at the problem.  Then took no responsibility. Nice.", "Yep, YTA.  Don't steal other people's stuff.  It's a pretty good rule to live by.", "YTA. Just because your roommate opens their nookie jar, doesn't mean you can take freely from their cookie jar.", "YTA just saw your comment that he\u2019s in ED recovery\u2026 I\u2019m concerned about your lack of sympathy and thought process here \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. We don\u2019t keep snacks around because he\u2019s in ED recovery. (I guess I could keep them in my room. And also he does all the grocery stuff cause again he likes healthy stuff and I\u2019m pretty easy so I always eat takeout or whatever.\u201d", "YTA. Stealing food makes you TA literally how do you even need to ask", "YTA, both for what you did and for even asking if you were TA. \n\nYou\u2026really thought eating someone else\u2019s food is acceptable? What, are you the lunchroom thief at your work, too?", "Yes, YTA. Don't steal. Don't steal food. Don't be an AH to the 'roommate' you're apparently having sex with.\n\nYou don't get to steal because other food isn't 'quick'. Buy, cook, and eat your own food. Ask if you want something that belongs to someone else.\n\nYou need to repeat kindergarten. You missed a few lessons.", "YTA \n\nIt is not like you would die of starving, it is your own fault for not taking into account your calories intake since you obviously know very well about your regime, IT was absolutely absurd of you to think it was okay to just eat somebody's meal prep while they sleep.\n\nI would say the only way to make it up to him is to meal prep for him according to his instructions/recipes and beg for forgiveness.", "YTA. You're a fucking thief", "Exactly how many of his meals did you eat?", "YTA , that was HIS meal prep.. not yours. \nWho gives a shit if you\u2019re hungry- why didn\u2019t you order yourself something or in future why not put some fruits around so you can snack on them or snacks ? I\u2019m confused - did you say you had sex with your roomate ? I hope if that\u2019s the case you didn\u2019t feel entitled to his meal prep because of that!", "YTA. The 1000-word essay justifying your theft makes no difference. You stole his meals. Not just his food, but prepped meals, which is even worse. Trying to justify it with all your excuses just shows how self-centered you are.", "YTA - He was there, ask.", "Yeah YTA. You know you need 4,000 calories a day and you didn't have anything of your own to eat? It does sound like you stepped in something you weren't expecting by messing with your roommate's food, but you're still TA for assuming it would be fine.\n\nEdit: Oh holy shit I just saw that Roommate is in recovery for an ED. There is no excuse for not understanding his attachment to that specific food or not expecting that reaction. YTA x1000.", "YTA", "YTA meal prep takes so much time to plan out and you were being a dick and ate all of his prep", "YTA. You better get to replacing those meals right away and make them better than they were. And apologize profusely", "Do you really need to be told YTA?", "Do you really have to ask? Duh, YTA", "YTA times two. \n\nFirst, you failed to plan ahead and foisted the consequences on your roommate by stealing his food. Its not like keeping a stash of protein bars in your room is hard to do. \n\nSecond, from your comments, it sounds like he has a lot of issues around food/eating habits. The security of having prepped meals is likely a way for him to cope and build healthier habits. \n\nYou should apologize for being inconsiderate and understand that his meals are off limits to you.", "I don't understand how someone can walk around being this much of an asshole and be so oblivious.", "YTA. A HUGE ONE. Who eats 5 prepped meals without a thought for the person who paid for the ingredients and spent time preparing it.", "YTA. 5 meals!!! You knew why he was prepping meals. You knew it was a big deal. Do you actually care about your roommate? Don\u2019t answer. Your actions tell on you. BTW - There are actual human beings dying of starvation. You missed ONE lunch.", "YTA. You stole 5 of his meals he specifically preps because he\u2019s recovering from an ED. He doesn\u2019t want shitty restaurant lunches. He shopped and spent his valuable time. You are such a ginormous entitled arrogant AH.", "YTA   \n\nThis is a huge deal.  You know this is important to him. You undermined his week.  You could have either cooked or ordered door dash. Nope you ate his painstakingly specific meal!", "YTA\n\nIf you're hungry, you need to get your own food. It's not okay to take someone else's food just because you're hungry. Meal prep also takes a lot of time and effort. \n\n>He\u2019s a retail manager and his workweek is Sunday to Thursday\n\n>I offered to buy him lunch for the week.\n\nHere's why your \"solution\" doesn't work. If your roommate's retail job experience is anything like mine was, he gets about 30 minutes for lunch. Maybe an hour if he's lucky. Instead of taking his pre-prepped meals to work, your roommate now has to spend part of his lunch break going to get food. That's less time to eat and maybe socialize.", "YTA, he had put time and effort into prepping his meals for the week and you could take the time to make your own food for the evening?", "Do you even have to ask???? Of course YTA. If you need to eat that much start grocery shopping accordingly. Don\u2019t make your problem your roommate\u2019s problem. I don\u2019t care why you did it, you don\u2019t steal peoples food.", "Yta op. That was their food not yours.", "YTA  and apparently a bit dense. If he wanted to just grab some random junk for lunch, we wouldn't be meal prepping. How are you going to fix this?", "YTA, it wasn\u2019t yours to take. If you know you need more food you need to buy enough food", "YTA I hate people who steal.", "YTA", "YTA. That food isn\u2019t yours!!!!! Could you be any more of a d-bag, when your roommate went through the effort of prepping meals\u2026. You didn\u2019t, but then decide to eat his because it was convenient. \n\nYour responsibility to figure out what keeps you full when you\u2019re lifting, ahead of time. If you lived by yourself, you\u2019d have no one else\u2019s food to steal and have to figure it out yourself.", "YTA. Might be? Ha! Why aren't you meal prepping if you have such a high metabolism? You ate a weeks worth of meals! Surely you could have whipped something up yourself in the time it took to eat 5 dinners!", "So, what is your roommates is yours. And your roommate is there to service you with food and sex. I get it, YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThis is even worse because he\u2019s in ED recovery. \n\nFeeling and being in control is huge part of ED. You didn\u2019t just eat his food. You took away control from him.", "How dare you!  If he had eaten your food you would have gone through the roof.  You know YTA, now go to the store and replace ALL the meals your roomie made with your own should be ashamed of yourself hands.\n\nNever ever touch anyones food again.", "YTA\n\nWell done on loosing your virginity, maybe now it's time to grow up and stop being an asshole?", "YTA", "YTA you don't just eat someone else's food. Did your parents not teach you common courtesy?", "YTA. You took something that wasn't yours. That's theft. The fact you seem confused about this not being acceptable behaviour is quite concerning.", "YTA what the fuck is wrong with you?", "Was there no other food in the house you could eat? And if not, why not? YTA, and you know it.", "Yta. If its not a big deal why dont you cook for yourself ? Yes because it a pain in the ass. He make time to prep for his week on is day off and you decided to ruin all that ant even seem to be apologetic about", "YTA .. don\u2019t mess with peoples food man.", "YTA. Yes, this is really a big deal. He's prepping things he likes that will satisfy him and meet his goals for the week. It's not just the money. It's the time planning and prepping as well as the assurance that he has the right portions. You don't make that up by buying him lunch because the difference in macros between that lunch and what that lunch replaced has to be calculated and made up elsewhere.", "OP \ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\n\nStop doubling down\n\nYou made a terrible decision and demonstrated you have no personal INTEGRITY no RESPECT for your roommate.\n\nThose words are capitalized, I recommend you look them up and spend some time on reflection.\n\nRead the messages from others here.

Not only did you eat all his food, you wasted the time he spent shopping, planning and prepping.\n\nYou can eat whatever, he cannot.

Shop for yourself.", "YTA-yes it is a big deal. How do you know that he even has the time to step out and get good?  You stole his food for his work week to satisfy your hunger. If you find yourself getting hungry, you should meal prep for yourself or buy yourself things that you could make yourself in a hurry. You owe him a big apology.", "YTA and no one will say otherwise. You ate 5 of his meals because you're selfish and can't control yourself. You, sir, are a glutton, and ha e no excuse for taking one of his meals, let alone 5. Go to the store and remake them for him.", "Yta. Too lazy to make your own meal sp you ripped of the meals your roommate cooked.  Thief. Selfish childish jerk of an ahole.

We paired up through mutual friends and we are mostly very compatible. Recently, we\u2019ve started working out together as something fun and healthy to do together. So since I\u2019m lifting more, my metabolism is going insane.  I\u2019m taking in like 4000 calories or more to feel satisfied.\n\nHere\u2019s why I might be TA. My roommate meal preps every Friday for his week (He\u2019s a retail manager and his workweek is Sunday to Thursday). On Friday, we worked out in the morning and I had a steak and egg burrito + my usual smoothie. I went to work, but was stuck in meetings the whole day so I didn\u2019t have time to eat until we met with friends for dinner. I had a salad and prawns to start + fajitas for the main. When we got back, we had sex (which isn\u2019t relevant at all but does explain why else I would be so hungry) and then he went to sleep but I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was starving. It\u2019s the middle of the night. The only thing we have that\u2019s quick are his meals. And I ate until I felt full. \n\nThe next day, he woke me up stressed about the meals, and I told him what I had done. All he could say was, what the fuck is wrong with me? He started freaking out and crying, and I offered to buy him lunch for the week. He didn\u2019t accept that, called me a selfish AH and just left the house.\n\nIs this really that big a deal?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You stole food and when asked about it, you acted like you were entitled to it you while disregarding the time, money, planning, and organization he puts in to keep his life running smoothly. You violated his boundaries and routine unapologetically. You\u2019re not just an AH, you\u2019re a selfish AH with zero self awareness.", "Of course it\u2019s that big a deal. YTA, a massive one. You need to immediately replace all that food, and stay out of his food from now on.", "Yeah, your roommate is correct, YTA.\n\nYou took the food that HE prepped ahead of time for himself and ate it because it was \"the only thing that's quick\".\n\nSo, not only did you steal his food, you did it because you're lazy.\nYou could have made yourself something.  It wouldn't have taken that long. You were hungry, not actually starving. \n\nGrow up.", "You really are just a little piggy then YTA.", "YTA and a huge one! You ate 5 of his prepped meals.
