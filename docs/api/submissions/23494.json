{"id": 23494, "submission_id": "15dokj1", "title": "AITA for Eating My Roommate\u2019s MealPrepped Meals?", "selftext": "My (m27) roommate(m29) and I have lived together for eight months. We paired up through mutual friends and we are mostly very compatible. Recently, we\u2019ve started working out together as something fun and healthy to do together. So since I\u2019m lifting more, my metabolism is going insane.  I\u2019m taking in like 4000 calories or more to feel satisfied.\n\nHere\u2019s why I might be TA. My roommate meal preps every Friday for his week (He\u2019s a retail manager and his workweek is Sunday to Thursday). On Friday, we worked out in the morning and I had a steak and egg burrito + my usual smoothie. I went to work, but was stuck in meetings the whole day so I didn\u2019t have time to eat until we met with friends for dinner. I had a salad and prawns to start + fajitas for the main. When we got back, we had sex (which isn\u2019t relevant at all but does explain why else I would be so hungry) and then he went to sleep but I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was starving. It\u2019s the middle of the night. The only thing we have that\u2019s quick are his meals. And I ate until I felt full. \n\nThe next day, he woke me up stressed about the meals, and I told him what I had done. All he could say was, what the fuck is wrong with me? He started freaking out and crying, and I offered to buy him lunch for the week. He didn\u2019t accept that, called me a selfish AH and just left the house.\n\nIs this really that big a deal?\n\nEdit/Update: Okay! I hear you all loud and clear! I am a giant asshole! I just assumed that buying him takeout would suffice for my fuckup. I looked up what y\u2019all were saying about safe foods and what all that entails for people with EDs. Didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t an easy fix. I\u2019m stubborn and arrogant and I know that. I\u2019m in therapy, please shut up about it. I still don\u2019t see why so many of you are so hung up on the fact that we\u2019re fwb but whatever. I\u2019m going to apologize and find out how he\u2019d like me to fix it. Thanks for the death threats.\n\nSecond Edit/Update: I feel dumb for being so arrogant about this. I signed up to a meal kit subscription thing and I\u2019ll try that cause they provide the recipes and the ingredients. Maybe that\u2019ll transition into better habits. Gonna give my roommate some space for now, per his request, and then work out how to support him cause I didn\u2019t mean to potentially cause him to relapse. I\u2019m just a dummy, among other things. Thanks to some of you all, fuck you to most of you all, esp you sex-obsessed freaks who think I\u2019m cheating on my fwb who also fucks other people lol)", "created_utc": 1690731507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dokj1/aita_for_eating_my_roommates_mealprepped_meals/", "score": 1549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You ate things of his that he had bought, prepared, and set aside for himself. There is no reason you should be so hungry that your need for a quick meal supersedes his ability to eat his own food. You ARE a selfish asshole. You stole from him. You KNEW it was meal prepped FOR HIM, and you probably ate more than A single meal, if you ate until you 'felt full'. You're piggish. And rude. Make your own goddamn food. Or order something, ffs. What is wrong with you? Your mother would be so disappointed.", "YTA. What you did is called stealing. He spent time, money, and energy into meal prepping for HIMSELF. It\u2019s not his problem that you aren\u2019t accounting for the extra calories you need.", "Major YTA. Jesus man. He spent time making food for the entire week, possibly to meet some specific nutritional goals, and you mowed it all down without a thought? That\u2019s possibly the rudest thing I can think of.", "Don't steal his food. If you really needed to eat something or you wouldn't be able to sleep, you should've ordered.

Even my dog knows not to take other people's food. And it sounds like you didn't stop at just one meal either - totally unnecessary.", "Is it a big deal you stole his food?  YTA and a thief.", "YOU ATE FIVE OUT OF SEVEN MEALS!!! Those meals are prepped because he\u2019s recovering from and eating disorder!!!! You\u2019re a horrifically awful person when you\u2019re recovering from an ED it\u2019s terrifying to eat food you\u2019ve not prepared so it\u2019s not easy to just deal with you buying meals for him. It\u2019s not even like it was just one you went and fucking inhaled almost all of them. YTA if you\u2019re eating 4000 cal a day you need to have snacks in", "YTA, if you know you need such an insane amount of calories and your roomie needs less doesn't mean you're entitled to literally steal his food. Why don't you have food/snacks in the house for unforeseen situations like these? I probably need half of your caloric intake but I always have either snacks or easy food to cook case I get really hungry.  \n\n\nEdit: holy crap, now I just saw your comment that you ate 5 of his meals, FIVE. So let me get this straight: he works as a retail manager, Sun-Thu which means he's probably meal prepping on Fri/Sat and on Fri night you decided to eat 2 days' worth of his meals...and on top of it all, you only offer to buy him lunch aka only one meal!!", "YTA.  Ask before you take or consume something  that belongs to someone else.", "Very much YTA. If you're hungry, prep yourself some food, don't take someone else's without their express permission. You didn't even ask, you just helped yourself as if you were somehow entitled to their food", "YTA.  You're full of excuses. You know you're hungry more, but you've made no plans for it.  You didn't shop, you didn't prep, you didn't order out. What you did was steal his hard work, his food and throw money at the problem.  Then took no responsibility. Nice.", "Yep, YTA.  Don't steal other people's stuff.  It's a pretty good rule to live by.", "YTA. Just because your roommate opens their nookie jar, doesn't mean you can take freely from their cookie jar.", "YTA just saw your comment that he\u2019s in ED recovery\u2026 I\u2019m concerned about your lack of sympathy and thought process here \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. We don\u2019t keep snacks around because he\u2019s in ED recovery. (I guess I could keep them in my room.

Stealing food makes you TA literally how do you even need to ask", "YTA, both for what you did and for even asking if you were TA. \n\nYou\u2026really thought eating someone else\u2019s food is acceptable? What, are you the lunchroom thief at your work, too?", "Yes, YTA. Don't steal. Don't steal food. Don't be an AH to the 'roommate' you're apparently having sex with.\n\nYou don't get to steal because other food isn't 'quick'. Buy, cook, and eat your own food. Ask if you want something that belongs to someone else.\n\nYou need to repeat kindergarten. You missed a few lessons.", "YTA \n\nIt is not like you would die of starving, it is your own fault for not taking into account your calories intake since you obviously know very well about your regime, IT was absolutely absurd of you to think it was okay to just eat somebody's meal prep while they sleep.\n\nI would say the only way to make it up to him is to meal prep for him according to his instructions/recipes and beg for forgiveness.", "YTA. You're a fucking thief", "Exactly how many of his meals did you eat?", "YTA , that was HIS meal prep.. not yours. \nWho gives a shit if you\u2019re hungry- why didn\u2019t you order yourself something or in future why not put some fruits around so you can snack on them or snacks ? I\u2019m confused - did you say you had sex with your roomate ? I hope if that\u2019s the case you didn\u2019t feel entitled to his meal prep because of that!", "YTA. The 1000-word essay justifying your theft makes no difference. You stole his meals. Not just his food, but prepped meals, which is even worse. Trying to justify it with all your excuses just shows how self-centered you are.", "YTA - He was there, ask.", "Yeah YTA. You know you need 4,000 calories a day and you didn't have anything of your own to eat? It does sound like you stepped in something you weren't expecting by messing with your roommate's food, but you're still TA for assuming it would be fine.\n\nEdit: Oh holy shit I just saw that Roommate is in recovery for an ED. There is no excuse for not understanding his attachment to that specific food or not expecting that reaction. YTA x1000.", "YTA", "YTA meal prep takes so much time to plan out and you were being a dick and ate all of his prep", "YTA. You better get to replacing those meals right away and make them better than they were. And apologize profusely", "Do you really need to be told YTA?", "Do you really have to ask? Duh, YTA", "YTA times two. \n\nFirst, you failed to plan ahead and foisted the consequences on your roommate by stealing his food. Its not like keeping a stash of protein bars in your room is hard to do. \n\nSecond, from your comments, it sounds like he has a lot of issues around food/eating habits. The security of having prepped meals is likely a way for him to cope and build healthier habits. \n\nYou should apologize for being inconsiderate and understand that his meals are off limits to you.", "I don't understand how someone can walk around being this much of an asshole and be so oblivious.", "YTA. A HUGE ONE. Who eats 5 prepped meals without a thought for the person who paid for the ingredients and spent time preparing it.", "YTA. 5 meals!!! You knew why he was prepping meals. You knew it was a big deal. Do you actually care about your roommate? Don\u2019t answer. Your actions tell on you. BTW - There are actual human beings dying of starvation. You missed ONE lunch.", "YTA. You stole 5 of his meals he specifically preps because he\u2019s recovering from an ED. He doesn\u2019t want shitty restaurant lunches. He shopped and spent his valuable time. You are such a ginormous entitled arrogant AH.", "YTA   \n\nThis is a huge deal.  You know this is important to him. You undermined his week.  You could have either cooked or ordered door dash. Nope you ate his painstakingly specific meal!", "YTA\n\nIf you're hungry, you need to get your own food. It's not okay to take someone else's food just because you're hungry. Meal prep also takes a lot of time and effort. \n\n>He\u2019s a retail manager and his workweek is Sunday to Thursday\n\n>I offered to buy him lunch for the week.\n\nHere's why your \"solution\" doesn't work. If your roommate's retail job experience is anything like mine was, he gets about 30 minutes for lunch. Maybe an hour if he's lucky. Instead of taking his pre-prepped meals to work, your roommate now has to spend part of his lunch break going to get food. That's less time to eat and maybe socialize.", "YTA, he had put time and effort into prepping his meals for the week and you could take the time to make your own food for the evening?", "Do you even have to ask???? Of course YTA. If you need to eat that much start grocery shopping accordingly. Don\u2019t make your problem your roommate\u2019s problem. I don\u2019t care why you did it, you don\u2019t steal peoples food.", "Yta op. That was their food not yours.", "YTA  and apparently a bit dense. If he wanted to just grab some random junk for lunch, we wouldn't be meal prepping. How are you going to fix this?", "YTA, it wasn\u2019t yours to take. If you know you need more food you need to buy enough food", "YTA I hate people who steal.", "YTA", "YTA. That food isn\u2019t yours!!!!! Could you be any more of a d-bag, when your roommate went through the effort of prepping meals\u2026. You didn\u2019t, but then decide to eat his because it was convenient. \n\nYour responsibility to figure out what keeps you full when you\u2019re lifting, ahead of time. If you lived by yourself, you\u2019d have no one else\u2019s food to steal and have to figure it out yourself.", "YTA. Might be? Ha! Why aren't you meal prepping if you have such a high metabolism? You ate a weeks worth of meals! Surely you could have whipped something up yourself in the time it took to eat 5 dinners!", "So, what is your roommates is yours. And your roommate is there to service you with food and sex. I get it, YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThis is even worse because he\u2019s in ED recovery. \n\nFeeling and being in control is huge part of ED. You didn\u2019t just eat his food. You took away control from him.", "How dare you!  If he had eaten your food you would have gone through the roof.  You know YTA, now go to the store and replace ALL the meals your roomie made with your own should be ashamed of yourself hands.\n\nNever ever touch anyones food again.", "YTA\n\nWell done on loosing your virginity, maybe now it's time to grow up and stop being an asshole?", "YTA", "YTA you don't just eat someone else's food. Did your parents not teach you common courtesy?", "YTA. You took something that wasn't yours. That's theft. The fact you seem confused about this not being acceptable behaviour is quite concerning.", "YTA what the fuck is wrong with you?", "Was there no other food in the house you could eat? And if not, why not? YTA, and you know it.", "Yta. If its not a big deal why dont you cook for yourself ? Yes because it a pain in the ass. He make time to prep for his week on is day off and you decided to ruin all that ant even seem to be apologetic about", "YTA .. don\u2019t mess with peoples food man.", "YTA. Yes, this is really a big deal. He's prepping things he likes that will satisfy him and meet his goals for the week. It's not just the money. It's the time planning and prepping as well as the assurance that he has the right portions.

We paired up through mutual friends and we are mostly very compatible. Recently, we\u2019ve started working out together as something fun and healthy to do together. So since I\u2019m lifting more, my metabolism is going insane.  I\u2019m taking in like 4000 calories or more to feel satisfied.\n\nHere\u2019s why I might be TA. My roommate meal preps every Friday for his week (He\u2019s a retail manager and his workweek is Sunday to Thursday). On Friday, we worked out in the morning and I had a steak and egg burrito + my usual smoothie. I went to work, but was stuck in meetings the whole day so I didn\u2019t have time to eat until we met with friends for dinner. I had a salad and prawns to start + fajitas for the main. When we got back, we had sex (which isn\u2019t relevant at all but does explain why else I would be so hungry) and then he went to sleep but I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was starving. It\u2019s the middle of the night. The only thing we have that\u2019s quick are his meals. And I ate until I felt full. \n\nThe next day, he woke me up stressed about the meals, and I told him what I had done. All he could say was, what the fuck is wrong with me? He started freaking out and crying, and I offered to buy him lunch for the week. He didn\u2019t accept that, called me a selfish AH and just left the house.\n\nIs this really that big a deal?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You stole food and when asked about it, you acted like you were entitled to it you while disregarding the time, money, planning, and organization he puts in to keep his life running smoothly. You violated his boundaries and routine unapologetically. You\u2019re not just an AH, you\u2019re a selfish AH with zero self awareness.", "Of course it\u2019s that big a deal. YTA, a massive one. You need to immediately replace all that food, and stay out of his food from now on.", "Yeah, your roommate is correct, YTA.\n\nYou took the food that HE prepped ahead of time for himself and ate it because it was \"the only thing that's quick\".\n\nSo, not only did you steal his food, you did it because you're lazy.\nYou could have made yourself something.  It wouldn't have taken that long. You were hungry, not actually starving. \n\nGrow up.", "You really are just a little piggy then YTA.", "YTA and a huge one! You ate 5 of his prepped meals.

Also are you really telling me you didn\u2019t have a loaf of bread or a box of cereal in the house, because frankly I don\u2019t believe that instead I think you thought his food was better than the boring stuff in the cupboards and so had that instead.", "YTA", "Definitely YTA\n\nA good way to apologize is to make sure you don't just replace the food but buy MORE than you stole, and if you can, find a way to replace the effort it took your roommate to pre prep the meals.

I don't have an ED but I DO have a LOT of medical issues including Type 2 Diabetes. So I do my best to eat low calorie, low salt, low fat, low carb and low sugar. And let me tell you it's HARD. If an item is low in one of the categories, it's almost always higher in one or more of the others to make up for it.\n\nSo if I've done a ton of work to find food/recipes that meet all those categories and are also filling, I would be PISSED if someone ate them and I then had to eat takeout all week. It's nearly impossible to find things that wouldn't go way over in all areas. One single meal could blow past my daily allotment for everything. If I do manage to find something on the menu that fits, it's going to be so little food I'll be hungry all day. So I'm either forced to be hungry or eat a boatload of shit that's really bad for me.\n\nI realize it probably sounds like disordered eating. Just to be clear when I'm talking allotments/limitations I mean: I try to stick to no more than 1,600-1,800 calories per day, 150g of carbs, as many zero sugar items as possible or otherwise low sugar, low salt or no salt added products, low fat products. Per my doctor there are just some items I completely stay away from. I read the labels on everything I buy.\n\nI'm not super strict with it, it's more of a framework I try to stay within. If it eat 2,200 calories one day I'm not going to freak out about it. I'm not looking up or worrying about the calories of fruits and vegetables. I keep healthy snacks in the house I can grab without thinking about. And I can balance things. 150g of carbs a day I break down to 50g per meal. I doesn't mean I'm not going going to eat something that's over 50g of carbs it's just I'm going to adjust lower on other meals to compensate. \n\nI also have medical conditions that can/do cause vitamin deficiencies. Which if I'm making my own lunches, I can add food that's high in whatever vitamin I may be deficient in. With takeout, those specific foods may not be available. Or if they are, may be prepared in such a way that is super high in fat,salt, or sugar which is bad for my other medical issues.\n\nPeople with severe food allergies probably meal prep to ensure there isn't any cross contamination.

Since you already accept you're TA, I'm not going to heap burning coals on yr head, but instead will try to help you. I used to be a gym rat before a motorcycle accident so I understand your situation. Prepping yr own meals is easy in this age of dueling delivery services.\n\nStart by sincerely apologizing to yr partner. Do something tangible to cement yr sincerity, like replacing all his food you ate + also buying his next week's supplies. Then do the following:\n\n1st, drop Blue Apron. Every service has had contamination scandals so it's best to avoid them. You don't need e. Coli messing you up.\n\n2d, sign up for Instacart, DoorDash, etc. Don't be a douche, tip them. Google then order fresh protein-rich foods, veggies, & fruits of yr choice. Order bulk dry beans/lentils. Order meats/fish. If fresh/bulk is too much to handle now, canned or frozen is fine. Packaged cooked meat/canned fish is available sliced, diced, cubed so you don't have to get yr hands dirty if yr afraid of the knife. But I guarantee, once you start yr own prep you'll eventually work up to fresh ingredients. Also buy yr own snacks to have on hand for post-coital binge-eating. There are sooo many healthy ones now. All this will be cheaper than Blue Apron, et al. \n\n3d, invest in a rice cooker if you don't already have one. Learn to use it. Buy a big bag of rice, preferably brown. (PS: pilaf is rice cooked with beef/chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor.) \n\n4th, ask to join yr partner when he does his weekly meal prep, if he'll have you. This way, maybe it will get thru yr thick skull how much effort he puts into managing his ED & why he had an emotional meltdown when he saw you had stuffed yr fat gob with a week of his carefully prepared meals. In this way, meal prep won't feel like such a chore & you might learn new things. \n\n5th, this is the easy part & you have two ways to do it, even if yr partner isn't ready to let you join him. I'm assuming at this point you'll be buying canned/frozen pre-cooked foodstuffs cuz yr too concerned with the gym to  adequately adult & learn to feed yourself. Either get 1 or 2 large storage bowls or portion meals in separate smaller bowls. Dump in rice. Dump in meat/fish, beans, veg of yr choice. Season however. I like lemon, butter, salt, pepper. Mix together. Put in fridge. Microwave as needed.\n\n6th, apologize again. You know why. You have an entire thread giving every reason why. Try to not take offense, keep an open mind, & listen to them all\n\nI hope this helps \ud83d\ude0a", "Plus I love the \u201cthe only thing quick we had were his meals\u201d - you don\u2019t have ANY snacky foods?

That\u2019s the right thing to do. \nDon\u2019t just \u201cgive him space\u201d Fix what you did.", "Seriously, it\u2019s so inconsiderate! I understand the meal prepping\u2026 I work long hours without breaks or the ability to leave my work station, so I spend time weekly to ensure I have healthy meals and snacks made and ready to go for work. I also live with multiple other people. Yet no one has taken any of my work food?? Or my other food for that matter, unless it\u2019s known to be communal (like seasonings/condiments). \n\nThey all know I make the food specifically to bring to work. They know I can\u2019t leave and have nothing if they take it. But none of them are assholes.", "How on earth does someone eat FIVE meal prepped meals like that\u2019s insane like I\u2019m trying so hard to understand went to the gym stuck in meeting so I didn\u2019t get my lunch (all I can see is a whining baby at this point) went to dinner which should have been enough but since we had sex that means I\u2019m even more hungry now there\u2019s other food in the house but his is faster sat down and ate one but said ya know what m not full went back and got another and do tuned to do this until basically they were gone which just HAPPENED to be the exact moment he felt full (sounds more like lazy and didn\u2019t wanna make something for himself then he was actually full) when all is said and done he consumed FIVE meal prep meals which honestly his stomach should have freaking exploded then didn\u2019t understand y take out wasn\u2019t on ok alternative? Ok so y didn\u2019t he door dash or something instead or taking something he knew wasn\u2019t his like does he think his roommate LIKES cooking five days worth of food all at once? If he isn\u2019t even willing to cook one because \u201cit\u2019s late and he\u2019s hungry\u201d and he\u2019s nearly who needs 4000 calories a day unless they r like a professional athlete or something! This seems insane to me, did I get that right?", "Nah doesn't read like that; reads like your standard gay jock asshole with zero empathy. Community's chock full of them, and more often than not they're ultra predatory.", "THEN WHY STEAL THE ROOMMATES FOOD! You are despicable, intentionally obtuse, and cruel. Please, please, PLEASE, understand that YTA!", "I\u2019d say for a lunch that\u2019s normal, but for dinner it\u2019s definitely on the lower end (at least in my experience)", "YTA. Alright, i absolutely refuse to believe this is real! No one can be this dense!", "Oh boo fucking hoo, you have to cook your own food now like every other functional adult."]}
