This man Rick (fake name) told me that I would not be allowed there because I caused her passing. I was taken aback. Her passing really messed me up I loved her so much and I tried my best to help her. I tried to tell him I begged her not to I tried calling her but nothing. He cut me off and told me that I could have done better and that now he has lost his daughter. He said there was no way for me to go. So when the funeral was over most friends and family asked why I didn\u2019t go. I told the the reason was because her dad blames me and didn\u2019t want me there. And now everyone has turned against him saying he shouldn\u2019t have said that to a kid and should have let me be there. I am know getting texts from his side saying how I shouldn\u2019t have aired out such a topic when the wounds were still fresh. I sorta feel bad because now people are kinda exiling him.

For real?! If he cared about his daughter, he wouldn't have abandoned her. And it is not your responsibility to take care of another parent's child. \n\nWounds still fresh my ass. He never cared for her and is trying to use her death for sympathy. He can have the life he deserves \ud83d\ude0c. \n\nAs far as him being exiled? His fault too. His actions and behavior are causing his own undoing. You just told them the truth when asked. \n\nI'm so sorry to hear that a dear friend of yours has passed. Sending you all the love in the world.", "Nta. He's projecting his blame on you. You couldn't force hospitalization on your friend but her parents could. Now he's probably having that fact pointed out to him.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. Block her family that is doing this, have your own personal memorial for her, and forget them all.", "I am so sorry for your loss.  Losing friends at such a young age is horrible.     \nNTA.   He shouldn't have taken out his grief on you. Other people were even shocked that you weren't there. Try not to let this adult's problems get to you.  It's not your fault - it's his. \n\nI'm so sorry. I hope you can visit her grave or something and say goodbye there.", "In my opinion NTA \nYou were enough important to your friend that people asked why you weren't there se no one thought that was your fault or something and you say that he wasn't in your friend's life so it's wasn't his job to accused you or decided who was \"invited\" and who wasn't\nAnd at the end you just answered honestly a question", "Info: Given you didn't actually share why he'd even assume you were responsible, it seems you might not think he's entirely wrong. So what is the full story?", "NTA. Your friend's dad is obviously hurting and looking for something or sometime to blame for his grief. But he definitely should not have said that to you, or banned you from the funeral. You had every right to share the truth, which must have been confusing and added another layer of hurt to your own grief, when people asked why you weren't there.

You were just stating a fact.  It's not your problem if the fact made an AH look like a TRUE AH.  I am confused about something though.  I have been to several funerals in my time.  At all the funerals I have been to....\n\nThere was never a doorman checking the list to see if you were on it.  Some random dude tells you that you are not allowed at a funeral.  But the funeral is about paying last respects to the \\*deceased\\*  (not the family or the alienated father of the deceased)  In my mind, you had just as much right to be there as \"Rick\" did.  And I don't think Rick would have done anything if you had shown up at the funeral.  Unless he's incredibly stupid.", "NTA, your friend's father shouldn't be blaming you for the passing of his child.

I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "Why he says that? I don't understand what happened.

I'm VERY curious as to why the sperm donor blames you for your her death? What happened, OP? Based on what you have shared, I've surmised your friend died from either suicide or a drug overdose, that you had  knowledge of the situation, but failed to notify her parent/guardian/teacher/police, which could have prevented her death.

I mother people are having the correct response. Don't hold onto those hurtful lies he projected", "I feel like it was very clear they were talking about her completing. Like, seems pretty cut and dry the friend ended her own life and the father feels that OP should have stopped it somehow.", "Yeah, wondering the same thing.  Like, nothing excuses the absentee dad from lashing out at a stranger and banning her from the wedding, but makes me think maybe a car crash OP the driver or something which is awful for everyone all around for course.   But for him to say he blames her without her telling us context is troubling to the point of telling.", "Unless it was like you were a drunk driver", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. Why does the father blame OP ? Seems kind of random unless there is more to this story.", "It sounds like she died by doing something herself, OP tried to get her help but wasn't successful. My guess is the dad heard OP's warnings, didn't do anything, and has now moved the pieces around in his brain so that he can blame a kid for what happened.", "Read between the lines.  What's not said is that the deceased made a regretful choice, and a friend of the deceased could not stop her.  The sperm donor of deceased is projecting his own feelings of guilt onto the friend.  This is based on his own feelings that he should have done more, so why didn't the friend do more?", "Agreed.\nWhat actually happened here, because yeah, if they were aware that their friend was attempting suicide, was anyone contacted to stop it?  I don't know.\nIf that's what happened, then as a parent, I would have banned too, to be honest.\n\nBut without knowing some context, I cant say YTA or NTA \n\nAnd you make a valid point with if her death coukd have been prevented, that shoukd be the focus and not whether they got to go to the funeral which would seem pretty selfish of that were the case", "OP-  I'm seeing a lot of speculation regarding the circumstances of your friend's death. I don't know what happened but YOU need to know, and always remember, this was NOT YOUR FAULT. You are a teenager. You are not a trained mental health or medical professional. It is cruel and unfair to suggest you were responsible for dealing with something way beyond your years. \n\nYou're grieving. You've been attacked by her dad. You've been denied the chance to pay your respects in the traditional manor. All of this makes you especially vulnerable right now. PLEASE, ignore those who are so quick to pass judgment. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited to correct op's age.", "Depends on how true the fathers statement is about you causing your friends death", "You're deliberately withholding info that's needed to make a meaningful judgment.", "Without knowing what happened I can\u2019t vote. Did you cause her death?", "NTA. You are not required to lie to cover up for him. What could he possibly have expected you to say to excuse your absence that wouldn't make you look like a jerk? You don't have to fall on your sword to protect him. If he feels the consequences of what he did, it's not your fault.", "I'm going to say NTA only because you were asked so you answered.\n\nOn the other foot, if what he said about the cause has merit, I don't blame him for his actions either. This missing detail is curious...", "NTA, ignore the people asking for details on your friends death and implying you feel responsible, they\u2019re just nosy and are trying to get details by pushing at your emotions. I hope you find some healing in this situation.", "NTA \n\nHe deserved it by blaming you for his daughter's actions. I assume he felt guilty over his child dying when he chose not to be involved, but that doesn't excuse blaming a child for someone else taking their own life.", ">I begged her not to I tried calling her but nothing.\n\nSeems like her friend committed suicide while OP was trying to call her and talk her off the proverbial ledge, and the dad is blaming her for not doing so successfully.", "Could have OD'd and they did drugs together. Or maybe OP helped her friend ditch school and friend died that day when she should have been in school. There's a lot of possibilities, and that key info seems to be missing.", "It's pretty obvious from context clues that her friend took her own life.

This is a complex situation and no one person is to blame, no one person can save someone from taking their own life.", "A family member can definitely keep others out of a funeral service.", "Most funerals are open, in case  anyone who knew the deceased wasn\u2019t known to the family. \n\nBut there are private, invite only funerals too. They are just less common. \n\nAnd in between these two types, there\u2019s all sorts of gray area on keeping one or two people out who will cause drama etc.", "Possibly speeding, running a red light and getting into an accident.  Even getting into an accident that wasn't her fault but not requiring her to wear a seat belt.  Could be MANY other things.", "Where does OP say their age?", "Without knowing what happened, we can't be sure it isn't partly her 'fault'.

We don't know.", "> It's pretty obvious from context clues that her friend took her own life.\n\nHow is it obvious?", "Completing? \n\nMy first thought was another AITA where a person was barred from their friend's funeral because their friend OD'd and they're the one who introduced them to heroin....", "> I feel like it was very clear they were talking about her completing.\n\n???? Did you mean competing, or are you missing a word?", "Thank you for bringing that my attention. I don't know what made me think that. I'll edit that part of my comment.", "You're correct. Personally, l read nothing in the comment that gave me reason to think it was that kind of scenario. As you said, we don't know what happened. It just seemed a lot of people are quick to make assumptions and criticize a kid when there's nothing to indicate they did something wrong. I am also making the assumption- that it was not their fault. If l'm proven wrong, so be it. I'll edit my comment and own it.", "She called her friend. She begged her not to do something. Those classicslly hint at someone dealing with a friend's suicide/self-harm.\n\n\nYes, it could've been an OD. But from the tone of OPs post I'm fairly confident in my deduction. \n\n\nRegardless, OP is a teenager. She isn't responsible for her friend's death.", "The OP is 17\u2026it\u2019s not impossible but that\u2019s not the vibe I\u2019m getting here.", "\"Completing\" is a euphemism for dieing for the movie Never Let Me Go.", "It's from a movie, Never Let Me Go.
