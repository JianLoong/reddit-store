Foster care is a nightmare.  I was kind of lucky, in that my last placement(age16 to 18) was with a really great family. But sadly that's rare. And everyone before that was absolutely horrible.\n\nWill the child be treated with kindness and compassion from you? It doesn't exactly sound like it. \n\nWhile It doesn't sound like you would physically abuse this kid, it does sound like you would be taking a lot of your feelings towards your sister out on him. And he definitely doesn't deserve that. \n\nA lot of his behavior is most likely due to being abandoned by his mother and being neglected. He really needs a loving, empathetic adult to take him in and care for him. Someone with patience. \n\nThere's no good answer. Either a child lives with an adult who resents and dislikes him or he's forced to move place to place within the foster care system and forced to endure all there is to endure within the system. \n\nESH", "If you can afford it, I feel like YTA.  I work with many people who were in foster homes as children and teens, and the stories are heartbreaking.  I recently represented a biological mother seeking to get her daughter back because she found out that the foster parents had her in a cage, shaved her head, would starve her and occasionally throw boiling water at her.  I know there are amazing foster parents too.  I would see it as a gamble of what could happen.  Your sister sucks.  Your mother did what she felt she was morally obligated to do and used your funds.

Unless you can expand as to how OP could be in the wrong?", "Hey OP, we found a volounteer to take your sister's kid in!", "Its in the post. His in another country.", ">they as an adult find and are angry with you?\n\n\nVery funny. Its almost as if he has a mother and Op is his aunt, right?", "Almost guaranteed. I\u2019m not saying OP is YTA for not taking him in but everyone should be honest about what the foster system is going to look like for a 12 year old with behavioural issues who\u2019s been abandoned by his mother and lost his grandmother. Kid doesn\u2019t stand a chance.", "Which is why being pro choice is so important and why I think it's great that being childfree by choice is getting more accepted. \n\nChildren deserve to live in families where they are wanted, not just tolerated because someone didnt have access to a condom.", "Yeah, like, what happened to the sister's college fund, cause she didn't use it for college", "Then the mother taking care of kid is no longer an option.", "Nothing would change, still would say no.", "Just my opinion, but if OP's sister was dead or incapacitated then it shifts to keeping a kid out of the (unfortunately woeful) foster care system, which to me, would have more ethical implications than it would in the current situation were it seems like OP's sister just can't be bothered with her parental responsibilities.", "Still wouldn\u2019t be OP\u2019s responsibility, but right now OP\u2019s mother is still enabling her sister while everyone else in the family seems to have decided not to. So right now, even though the title question is \u201cAITA for letting my nephew go into foster care?\u201d It\u2019s really the boy\u2019s mother that is letting that possibly happen. If the sister had died the question really does get shifted to \u201cAITA for letting my nephew go into foster care?\u201d Again, still doesn\u2019t make the nephew OP\u2019s responsibility and wouldn\u2019t make her TA, but it would put a finer point on the question.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo", "The fact that he's actually considering her opinion and hasn't appeared to argue with her about it. \n\nHe's also allowing his mum to guilt trip him even though she should be involving legal authorities against her daughter for abandonment.", "But he going to a state foster care bc his parent is refusing his care. Certainly they could at least charge her child support. Something needs to give in the situation. I don\u2019t see the state NOT going after her for money at least.\n\nEdit to add: I spent about 10 years in a custody case. State laws have a lot of nuances.\n\nI would take the child and sue the absolute shit out of her for his support.", "Dude, taking care of a kid is a life changing decision that should not be undertaken unless you are 100% sure you can and want to do it. Taking care of an arsonist kid is something you are possibly not even qualified for (what I mean by that is he might need professional, institutional help). \n\nEvasive maneuvers!", "And just fuck the kids life right ?", "Does your sister provide financial aid for her son? Or does your mother, yourself and other family members have to pitch in? If she's gonna abandon her son I hope she's at least making money ffs...", "She loves everyone more than OP.", "Longevity says absolutely nothing about the quality of a marriage.", "Obligation was the only reason?", "No gender was specified for the OP. Why are you assuming \"He\"?", "The sticky part is that it sounds like she's overseas, which limits what they can do to her.", "What is there to be \u2018torn\u2019 about? This child isn\u2019t the OP\u2019s and he has a living mother who can take him back but is refusing to. Why should the op take this boy in when his mother should be the one disrupting her new life for him?", "Nobody wants that, but sending the kid to live with someone who isn't equipped to properly care for them is doing them no favors either.", "The kid has a living, healthy parent. Maybe not the best parent, but presumably one that's functional enough. There's no reason for the kid to go into foster care unless OP's sister refuses to live up to her responsibilities.", "Lots of things do not reflect on the quality of the marriage.", "Yes Obligated in the fact that I came from a broken home And the feelings that brought up in me and not wanting to pass those on. My wife came from Strange adoption. I helped bring someone in the world without their consent, I thought it was at least my job to try to make them functioning adults to the best of my ability. I care about my children I care about my family but it's not love. But I really don't want to try and  dissect what is wrong with me.", "Agreed. Its not ops fault for the messes their sister made, but if I was op, I wouldnt be able to live with myself knowing I could have helped the kid, but I didnt.", "How many kids and people around you every day could you personally help, but don't, and sleep just fine?", "> I understand why OP would be bitter when the money had been promised to her, but what was her mother supposed to do?\n\nActually parent her child and tell her fuck no, you are taking responsibility for this or I'm calling the cops on your ass for child abandonement.", "Unless details are being left out, it sounds like there's no good reason OP's sister wasn't/isn't taking care of her own kid for any reason other than the fact that she *doesn't want to do it.* IMHO OP's mom is at least somewhat responsible for enabling that dynamic.", "Well, I cant. If I could I definitely would. And op stated that they could take care of the kid.", "How is it OPs mothers problem and not OPs?  It clearly is the sisters problem and she doesn\u2019t care.  But what makes you think OPs mother has a moral obligation and OP doesn\u2019t?", "Paying for a college education is above and beyond providing for your child.  It\u2019s a great thing to do if you can, but circumstances changed and OP\u2019s mother could not any longer.  That sucks for OP for sure, but it happens.  \n\nIf this was actually OP\u2019s money that she earned or that had been gifted to her by other people, that\u2019s different, and is indeed theft.  My understanding is that this was an account belonging to the mother in which she saved money that she intended to use to pay for OP to go to college - in which case losing the promise of that money would have been a huge disappointment to OP, of course, but not theft since it was not OP\u2019s money.  \n\nAnyway, the nephew is not a \u201cmistake\u201d or an appendage of the sister, he\u2019s a human being in his own right and a dependent child who needed a home.", "Yes, and that home should have been with his own mother."]}
