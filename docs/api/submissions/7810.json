Foster care is a nightmare.  I was kind of lucky, in that my last placement(age16 to 18) was with a really great family. But sadly that's rare. And everyone before that was absolutely horrible.\n\nWill the child be treated with kindness and compassion from you? It doesn't exactly sound like it. \n\nWhile It doesn't sound like you would physically abuse this kid, it does sound like you would be taking a lot of your feelings towards your sister out on him. And he definitely doesn't deserve that. \n\nA lot of his behavior is most likely due to being abandoned by his mother and being neglected. He really needs a loving, empathetic adult to take him in and care for him. Someone with patience. \n\nThere's no good answer. Either a child lives with an adult who resents and dislikes him or he's forced to move place to place within the foster care system and forced to endure all there is to endure within the system. \n\nESH", "If you can afford it, I feel like YTA.  I work with many people who were in foster homes as children and teens, and the stories are heartbreaking.  I recently represented a biological mother seeking to get her daughter back because she found out that the foster parents had her in a cage, shaved her head, would starve her and occasionally throw boiling water at her.  I know there are amazing foster parents too.  I would see it as a gamble of what could happen.  Your sister sucks.  Your mother did what she felt she was morally obligated to do and used your funds.

Gotta have love\n\nHaving a child only because of OBLIGATION is never the way to go. It helps no one. The child will suffer more than anyone", "I mean the kid\u2019s mother is living breathing and working. That OP\u2019s mom would literally try to cause OP more pain than make the sister pick up her own damn responsibility is insane .", "Mom is also T A for spending OP's college fund on this situation.", "[removed]", "Think the implication was she'd spent it on the travelling.", "What do you mean 'allow'? Sure doesn't sound like OP's allowing her to guilt trip them.", "Yeah he set a wooden bridge over a creek on fire.", "How the hell is it a hard one in any shape or form? OOP\u2019s sister isn\u2019t dead, she\u2019s *choosing* not to come back and take care of her own kid. \n\nNot his monkey, not his circus.", "12", "There is pretty strong research that says by 12, peer relationships are a far stronger influence than family.", "My mom tried her best.", "I think people do not get this. You are dumping a kid into an overburdened system rife with abuse and institutions that are lacking oversight etc.  Yeah, my family threw me into the system is such a great thing. UGH, and I am sorry you ended up in it.", "This is on the kid's mother and no one else.", "Why? How is that fair? He has actual living parents who should be caring for him, but OP is the disappointment? Make it make sense. Please.", "He also needs someone with the proper skills to deal with a traumatised kid who engages in destructive behaviour. \n\nLove and patience ain\u2019t gonna fix an arsonist.", "Martyrdom might work for you, but it doesn\u2019t work for everyone. \n\nStop trying to guilt trip someone who doesn\u2019t want to parent.", "No.  I tried my best to avoid spending time with him.", "Why is she TA?", "Yes this is so well said \ud83d\ude2d you wouldn\u2019t be doing him any favours by being a \u2018guardian\u2019 who can\u2019t give him the love and care he deserves, and it seems like you know that.", "I married my pregnant girlfriend out of obligation it will be 20 years in March.", "It's insane, but I can almost understand it.\n\nOP is clearly the more responsible of the two. If anyone in this situation was going to provide the care needed, it's definitely not OP's sister.", "It is very unfair to guilt-trip her like that. The kid already has been abused by his mother neglecting him, and she is the one responsible for him. I feel for him but it is not her sister's responsibility to ruin her own life because of him. HE HAS HIS OWN MOTHER who is neither dead nor ill and would be able to take him in BUT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO. How is this OP's responsibility? \n\nHold firm, OP, there are family reasons to help out but that's not it.", "NTA my person. Dodge the guilt trips that will continue to come in. How old was he when he burned the bridge?", "Thanks\n\nGenuinely torn on this one; it\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t want to turn your life upside down but let\u2019s face it there are millions of things that can happen to you at anytime that would turn your life upside down.\n\nThat said he\u2019s a young kid who has been abandoned and treated like a burden his whole life and the one stable person in his life is now going away too; it\u2019s no wonder he has behavioural issues.  \n\nYou have a chance to help turn his life around but don\u2019t want to take it for valid reasons.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a YTA from me, but it\u2019s borderline", "Do you think you\u2019ll ever see him again", "I'm sorry, maybe I was a bit harsh in how I was judging her. This was all dropped in her lap too. I'm sure she did do her best....maybe he just needed more than she knew how to give.", "OP isn\u2019t throwing him anywhere. The kid has a mother. It\u2019s HER shittiness that would cause the kid to go into foster care.\n\nJust because OP is the nearest stable adult does not mean he or she magically becomes the bad guy/gal here.", "No, they aren't. Their sister -- the one person who has genuine responsibility for her son -- is dumping him there. Even if you think that it's a duty for anyone who has the capacity to prevent him from going to foster care to do so, failing to interfere isn't the same as dumping anyone anywhere. \n\nYou can't drop a responsibility you never had in the first place.", "I'd be more disappointed in the sister, but still disappointed in op because op is in the position to give the child a better life.", "To be fair it doesn\u2019t work for me either.  As I said, it\u2019s a burden.  Similarly OP taking on a child will also be a burden.  \n\nMy remark is not a guilt trip.  It is an explanation of how I came to a conclusion based on my own anecdotal experiences.  It is completely true that some foster parents are amazing and some are terrible.\n\nI don\u2019t mind people disagreeing with me and Reddit karma means nothing to me.  I share my opinions based on experience.  A wide range of opinions is a good thing", "Because she resents her nephew and resents that her mother spent money raising her nephew rather than paying for her college.  The person at fault for that is her sister, not her mom and certainly not her nephew.  She\u2019s N T A for not taking in a kid she can\u2019t stand, but she\u2019s T A for directing that bitterness at a child.", "So accurate. The kid will know it, too. Growing up he will sense that bringing him into the family was nothing more than an obligation. He will see other families interact and see how other parents genuinely love their children. It will only damage the kid in the long run", "I hate to say it but her not really wanting to but taking him anyway would almost guarantee being better than the foster care system assuming she won\u2019t be abusive and mistreat him just may not be as happy as one would hope. Especially depending on his age.", "Ok but the mother doesn't want the kid and never did but does find it crappy that no one wants this kid and the family is also throwing the kid away like they are garbage.

Sorry I have little patience for families like this.", "The actual mother is working. There is no indication that she is struggling, financially or other wise. She decided to leave her child and the mom enables that and now instead of sending for her son, who she should presumably be able to care for, who is suffering from not having actual parents who care, OP is expected to just pick up the responsibility. \n\nIf anything, instead of badgering OP about taking in the boy, the family needs to be getting on that woman, even if it means the mom get them on a plane to South America and drop him with his Mother.", "Sharing a particularly gruesome story of child abuse in the context of the OP has only one purpose with a judgement of Y T A to her: to shame her into taking on her nephew by making her feel that if he experiences the same thing in foster care it will be her fault.", "She doesn\u2019t resent her nephew. And her mother is absolutely at fault for taking her college fund to pay for her sister\u2019s mistakes.", "The reality is that foster care has a lot of problems.  There is a lot of abuse and neglect.  Not all the time.  \n\nThese are my experiences of what I\u2019ve seen from countless individuals in foster homes.  \n\nWhat would you like me to say?  That foster homes are safe, loving places when I know they are not?  Am I supposed to say \u201cOP choose whatever feels right\u201d when OP is literally asking for peoples opinions?  \n\nI said some are terrible and some are good.  Whether OP does it or not is not determined by my one remark.  I don\u2019t know whether OP should or not and that is his or her choice.  But what I do know is someone should always make a decision after hearing different peoples opinions.", "\u201cTo pay for her sister\u2019s mistakes\u201d?  She reclaimed the money she herself had set aside, so far as I understand it, because she needed it *to provide for her grandson*.

Keeping a roof over a child\u2019s head is more important than providing a free college education.", "Which is OP\u2019s sister\u2019s and mother\u2019s problem, not OP\u2019s.
