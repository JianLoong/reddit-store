Foster care is a nightmare.  I was kind of lucky, in that my last placement(age16 to 18) was with a really great family. But sadly that's rare. And everyone before that was absolutely horrible.\n\nWill the child be treated with kindness and compassion from you? It doesn't exactly sound like it. \n\nWhile It doesn't sound like you would physically abuse this kid, it does sound like you would be taking a lot of your feelings towards your sister out on him. And he definitely doesn't deserve that. \n\nA lot of his behavior is most likely due to being abandoned by his mother and being neglected. He really needs a loving, empathetic adult to take him in and care for him. Someone with patience. \n\nThere's no good answer. Either a child lives with an adult who resents and dislikes him or he's forced to move place to place within the foster care system and forced to endure all there is to endure within the system. \n\nESH", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s outrageous that she of all people should criticise you for not wanting to take on her child when she has no time for him herself.  She has had years to \u201cget her life together\u201d and raise her child and it is patently obvious that she is more interested in having a good time and letting everyone else take responsibility for her actions.  Your mother and sister have looked at the situation and flipped it over and are pointing the finger at you.  They may well try to say that it\u2019s just for a year until she has sorted things out.  Don\u2019t take that bait - she will never be ready. This is why she moved to another continent - so she can be out of the picture completely.  I would tell your sister that you understand that she is trying to put her life together and as a favour you will kindly purchase a one way airline ticket for her son to the airport closest to her home, so that she can get some experience of being a mother.  Until that time she has no business saying that you are an asshole who should take on her child.\n\nSecondly Your Nephew:  This is tough because he is still a child who didn\u2019t ask for any of this. Life in foster care is difficult.  They often get moved around a lot and can\u2019t lay down any roots and make friends.  Their performance in school tends to suffer.  They often drop out.  No one misses them.  There are people out there that can spot vulnerable young people, and kids can end up being groomed, and get pushed into prostitution.  They can be drawn into crime - low level stuff at first, and then descending into much worse.  These kids are highly likely to be victims of crime.  Sometimes, because they are underage they get by drawn into committing a crime and then become victims of the criminal justice system.  Many of them will start using drugs, and will struggle to get and keep a job, struggle with mental and physical illnesses and suffer homelessness.  Sometimes all of those things and often while they are still minors.  This is not a job you want, not at all.  So for a moment  put aside your rightful indignation at being expected to take on this responsibility.  You know that the child has issues, and it probably won\u2019t be easy.  You probably won\u2019t get a medal for your efforts, but think it through.  Your NTA here whatever you choose to do.  Just make sure you can live with your decision.", "NTA, but I encourage you to think about this from your nephew's position. Fostering is **about the child,** and if you are unable or unwilling to provide what he needs, either financially or emotionally, then you absolutely shouldn't do it out of obligation. He will know you resent him.", "NTA\n\nYou've acknowledged that you can't give him the loving environment he needs.\n\nYour sister needs to step up and be a mother.
