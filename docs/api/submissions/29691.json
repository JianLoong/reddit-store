I've had to have lots of blood drawn in my life. It's something that can easily go *very* painfully and/or dangerously wrong, even with an experienced phlebotimist. The fact that he wants to do so without supervision, when he apparently hasn't even done a draw *under* supervision yet...sounds at best ethically suspect, at worst stupidly dangerous.", "NTA\n\nand your friend wanting to draw a real person's blood without a supervisor is exactly the reason why a supervisor is needed. if he's upset, he's not suitable for the job.", "NTA!  My wife is a phleb and when she was in school I volunteered AT the school multiple times.  At home while learning, without a properly trained person attending??  HELL NO!  and I trust her with my life.", "NTA, and if this is his attitude towards someone asserting their bodily autonomy, that's doesn't bode well for his future as a ~~DOCTOR~~ MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL (edit: point still stands even if he's not a doctor)\n\nTell him \"You're welcome for the free lesson. If you aren't clear and forthcoming about how a certain medical procedure is going to be done, you will lose their trust and potentially their consent.\"", "Not gonna lie this sounds like the beginning of a Dateline episode.", "NTA\n\nYeah, not wanting to do this seems completely normal. I've had actual phlebotomists at my doctor's office try so many times and mess up that I just call it and say I want someone else. They get more and more nervous each time they miss. I'm not saying your friend won't be good at it and he does need to practice on people but to do so in a supervised setting sounds more appropriate.", "NTA It was reasonable to think this would be supervised. Almost no one would want to be a pin cushion for someone who wants to have at a go at it for the first time without any supervision.\n\nIt's more important that the person being stuck is kept safe from suffering unnecessary harm than for him to be saved from first time nerves in front of a supervisor.", "NTA.  You agreed to supervised blood draws.", "NTA. This is a very bad idea. The whole point of supervision is to learn how to do this correctly.", "NTA - As soon as I read \"blood draws\" (meaning: more than one) all bets are off. Shots hurt, and getting one (or more) for nothing - not for actual tests or medicine - but for practice? No...", "Definitely NTA. It hurts, especially when someone is learning. They need to practice under supervision so they can learn the proper techniques.", "NTA\n\nAlso I\u2019m positive that if he were to ask his instructor \u201chey, I\u2019m pretty nervous and want to get some practice in. Do you think I should use live humans?\u201d The answer would be a hard no.\n\nTypically they will practice on something kind of like a ballon, then fake or pig skin, then classmates THEN other people.", "NTA. 1000% chance that this is forbidden by their program. When I was in nursing school they were VERY clear that under no circumstances should we be practicing injections on friends or family. What your friend is asking to do is almost certainly grounds for dismissal from their program.", "Ewwww! Absolutely NOT! And a serious warning; multiple needle sticks will make it look like you're an injection drug user. Not to mention the risk of infection by doing the procedure in a non-sterile setting.\n\nYou're NTA; friend should play doctor elsewhere.", "NTA. It's YOUR blood.", "Nta.... He needs to get used to being watched.", "NTA it's your body, you can withdraw consent to anything at any time. If he doesn't understand that he shouldn't be in the medical field in the first place", "NTA. If you're not comfortable with someone in training sticking needles in you, that's that, no discussion, explanations or excuses necessary. Don't students usually practice blood drawing on one another?", "NTA\nYea, I would want a student to do it without supervision either.\nI had some surgeries as a child and I have really deep veins so I know how painful it can get, specially when it's someone inexperienced to do so. \nNurses tend to dismiss my request for drawing from my hand and they can get really stubborn. Last year one pricked me several times on both arms before I had to say it was enough and to use my hand.\nI had bruises everywhere.", "Yeah this dude sounds like a walking red flag tbh NTA", "As someone who\u2019s had blood drawn 15+ times this year, 20% the time an newish nurse can\u2019t find my veins and I ask for another nurse after the second fail. No problem, experienced nurse works every time.\n\nSo, they \ud83d\udcaf% shouldn\u2019t be offended by a strong NO.\n\nThat said, practice makes perfect. If you like your friend and the concept of her practicing on you isn\u2019t troublesome, it would be a kind thing to do and really help your friend. It\u2019s quite low risk. But also your choice.", "NAH - You are perfectly entitled to withdraw permission if you feel uncomfortable with anything about it.   Its understandable that your friend is a little upset about losing the opportunity to practice.

Also, having the first attempts be supervised by a practiced professional is smart, as they can help if something goes wrong", "NTA. If he is already keen to break practice rules, how is he ever going to follow all of the rules and regulations that come with his job.", "NTA- suggest he practice on himself. It's 1000% possible for a student to self collect. I think it would assist his development to spend a bit of time locating his own viable veins for venepuncture. If he isn't confident in his ability- do not let him try. Just tell him the truth.

This is just weird.", "NTA I have been in the unfortunate position where a nurse went digging for a vein. This was a qualified professional who had done it a million times. Trainees are supervised for a reason.", "Nta", "I am a fully licensed working phlebotomist, this is a way for your friend to be removed from his classes and become blacklisted from this profession. It's not safe, ethical or even wise to do this as he has not got the training to help you if something goes wrong. What happens if he strikes bone? If he  hits a nerve? Not to mention that the entire idea starts with him stealing supplies. If you pass out and throw up on him? This is all-around a terrible idea and if his school finds out he's doing it, they **will** kick him out and not refund him.\n\nNTA", "NTA, do it under supervision.", "yeah no. under supervision or we have no deal. NTA", "NTA. I have let people practice on me, but only those I trust ( it\u2019s a small list) and only in our work place. If your friend is on a proper training program they should get lots of proper practice and not need to use you", "NTA and I would strongly suggest reaching out to his school and inform them that one of their students has been asking to perform unsupervised blood draws. The school needs to address the issue before your friend (and possibly other students) endangers someone's health and creates a liability for the school.", "NTA he could literally kill you.", "NTA.  I wouldn't let a phlebotomy student anywhere near me with a needle unless we were in a sterile environment and under the direct supervision of their instructor.", "NTA, you're always allowed to change your mind, especially when you have more information than you did before.", "NTA. Missing the vein driving a blood draw is painful. I wouldn\u2019t volunteer (even at the school tbh).  Consent can always be withdrawn!", "I am sorry, I don\u2019t use bad language, but hell to the no! \nRun the other direction , I can tell you stories of how that has gone wrong for so many people, just don\u2019t. You will thank yourself for not allowing him to use you as his Guinea pig.", "NTA - nurse here, do not agree to this, you've absolutely done the right thing by saying no. They can practice supervised like everyone else, I've let other nurses training practice on me plenty of times, I would never let them do it in my home unsupervised, theres so many things that could go wrong! Maybe show them this post if they aren't understanding.", "NTA.\n\nA medical student under the supervision tried to draw my vein blood once. She didn't fix the needle to stay stable enough and it somehow flipped out. Not fell, did a whole flip, so the blood immediately started flowing away from the vein. Everything was covered in blood, my hand, my jeans, the table, the wall nearby. I was laughing like a maniac amidst all of this, and the poor girl could not stop saying sorry while frantically help the experienced staff to deal with this all.\n\nTHERE MUST BE AN EXPERIENCED SUPERVISOR.", "Without supervision in a non sterile environment!!", "a doctor once missed the vein for a total of 7 times before the nurse took the needle away and did it herself. with all the failed attempts beforehand there was splurt of blood coming out for the first second, 30 cm diameter blood puddle on the ground. look way worse than it actually was but i never saw a nurse haunding a doctor out of the room xD", "I had a trained nurse fail to draw my blood twice and called for a more experienced nurse to take over. This was someone who draws blood daily struggling with my deep veins. Maybe op is easy to draw blood from, maybe they're difficult, but either way you need somebody trained in drawing blood around in an appropriate environment.", "Phlebotanists are technicians, not doctors.", "Next let me practice surgery on you...", "I ended up with an infected vein in a hospital because the tech was so distracted by his issues finding my vein that he forgot to sterilize the area before putting in the needle! (I was really dehydrated, which is why I went in. All I needed was some fluids that wouldn't be coming back up, but it turned into a bit of a circus)\n\nThat's a professional who had been doing it for years, and in fact had stuck me personally in the past! I've also ended up with a first timer blowing my vein and not realizing until a nurse told her to stop sticking me! I was bruised from my shoulder to my wrist on that one!\n\nDon't let it happen without supervision. A stick gone wrong can actually kill someone if things aren't put under control. If he sticks you and moves the wrong thing you'll be painting the walls with your blood. It's gross. (I don't know the parts of what they stick you with because I try not to think about it... I've just seen that one happen to my dad. Nobody in the room was calm after that)", "I just assumed that. He didn\u2019t actually say that before I agreed. It just never occurred to me that was even allowed.", "I have a pretty high pain tolerance and have volunteered before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for nothing, we need people who can do blood draws and they have to practice on someone. I didn\u2019t want to say it but I\u2019m more worried about making sure everything is hygienic and there\u2019s someone with experience in place if something goes wrong.", "There's even fake arms etc they can practice on nowadays!", "Why would she trust him with a task that he\u2019s explicitly asking to practice privately because he\u2019s no good at it?", "Patients having blood drawn at home is common practice. There\u2019s no such thing as a sterile environment. Unless it\u2019s an operating theatre. The equipment is sterile. The lack of supervision is the issue.", "Well clinics and hospitals are less sterile than you'd think. As long he sterilizes the area and the equipment it would be fine. Nurses do home blood draws all the time. But trusting a student to ensure everything is clean and properly done is a big ask imo.", "Ignorant comment. Blood drawings at home is incredibly common. My mother was a phlebotomist and exclusively went to peoples homes for work.", "The fact that the doctor tried 7 times is a huge red flag. I give someone two tries before I tell them to get someone else, but most people will only try three times before calling it.", "Noted, but I think my point still stands.", "Oh my! Very sorry that happened :(", "It probably isn\u2019t allowed", "Their program ensures that they have plenty of the practice they need to learn their skills...UNDER SUPERVISION.", "That makes sense, and I understand the need to practice - but what good is practicing without supervision? If there's nobody there with experience to observe the student, how can they learn what to do (or not to do) by *practicing* on their own without putting you (and your high pain tolerance) to the test. Moreover, do they even get credit for this or is it just for their own peace of mind?", "Oh I'm not saying she should. I'm just saying that I can see how feeling that would cause him to be a little upset even if it makes sense. I think OP is very reasonable in her decision.", "Agreed. In a similar vein, my partner currently has to give me injections daily at home. We do it on the couch or in our bedroom, the needle is in sterile packaging with the medicine already prefilled in the syringe so it's fine!", "I try twice before I get someone else, even when I'm confident I've identified the problem and can now successfully start a line.  While often I call it because it's clear my technique won't work on that patient, I just as often do because after two missed attempts, my patient is then afraid of my touching him/her, to a certain extent.\n\nIn my experience, physicians are more likely to continue trying than nurses or phlebotomists.  They're also much more likely to miss to begin with.  It's not that they're incompetent; it's that they're out of practice.  The only doctors I've found to be consistently good are oral surgeons.  They often have no one else in their offices certified to start IV's.", "young doc. dunno how often he had done it before, but as a child i had to take every inch of courage together to not start to cry, the last 2 attempts hurt especially. after the nurse came at his sixth attempt and asked him wtf he is doing he said \"one more try its really hard\". couldnt be that hard as she hit the first try with minimal pain\\^\\^\n\nwho knows. never saw that doc again\\^\\^", "Thanks. I have a chronic illness and so does my dad, so we both get stuck a lot. Plus I used to donate blood and plasma, so that caused a bunch as well. I've had or seen many different issues. It's scary stuff.", "It isn't, which is why OP naturally thought he was agreeing to supervised blood draws. \n\nIt is actively and frequently told to students NOT to practice outside of supervised settings!", "Ah gotcha"]}
