Just eating food that aligns with your own preferences isn't 'pushing your agenda' (it would have been if you demanded everyone eat vegan, but that's just ridiculous), and her saying you can go without food is insanely disrespectful. She invited you, she has to provide something to eat and drink or at least accommodate you bringing something else. I don't really see the issue with that either tbh, but honestly there's gazillions of other possible solutions that wouldn't be hard to implement or have a negative effect on the party.

That's nonsense, you're absolutely not the AH here.\n\nThat being said, I do think you could have brought it up better. Maybe just have a face to face discussion about the party, ask what the meal gonna look like exactly and if there's gonna be vegan food. From the way you wrote it, it sounds like you immediately jumped to 'I'll bring my own food', which means you did skip that step. It's understandable given how the barbecue was advertised, and it doesn't in any way excuse her behaviour, but maybe a conversation in which you discuss potential issues and solutions would have worked better than a message.

No coleslaw? Fruit Salad? Desserts? Sounds like the worst BBQ ever.", "I tried that diet for a few weeks and I was actually shocked at how \"regular\" I was the whole time.

Then I just hope they give the girl organ meat.", "Depends if they eat the organs as well. You can get all nutrients from a pure carnivore diet but you'd need to eat the organs as well for it. The Inuit do this since little to no vegetation grows up there so animals is all they have to eat.", "Interesting.  Thanks for the information!", "NTA. I really don't know why people get so hung up about other people's dietary preferences. If you are vegan, you can't eat her food. Also, unless you're one of the preachy vegans, the only one pressing an agenda is your sister by forcing her kid and guests to abide by her (if I am quite frank) unnatural, unhealthy and disgusting diet. Humans are not obligate carnivores and need more than just meat and eggs.", "Well i guess i'll go with NTA but this situation gives me the vibes fromwjen Stewie brought his veggie burgers to  a party and claimed no to do a big deal about it lol", "NTA if a host refuses not cater for a guests dietary needs, then either the guest brings their own food, or doesn't go. Your sister is not only pushing her own agenda, she is trying to control you too. That makes her an AH. If she is always trying to control your life, I'd be going L.C.

We need to eat both plants AND animals to get our full range of daily nutrients, especially for children to grow and be healthy. A healthy adult human should not have to take supplements to get additional nutrients. If anything, humans tend to eat far too many carbs/sugars as our rate of diabetes is currently through the roof.

If it's a large gathering I usually bring something that everyone can share if they want to try it, but it's not like I'm stopping anyone else from eating what they want.
