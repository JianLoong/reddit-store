Just eating food that aligns with your own preferences isn't 'pushing your agenda' (it would have been if you demanded everyone eat vegan, but that's just ridiculous), and her saying you can go without food is insanely disrespectful. She invited you, she has to provide something to eat and drink or at least accommodate you bringing something else. I don't really see the issue with that either tbh, but honestly there's gazillions of other possible solutions that wouldn't be hard to implement or have a negative effect on the party.

That's nonsense, you're absolutely not the AH here.\n\nThat being said, I do think you could have brought it up better. Maybe just have a face to face discussion about the party, ask what the meal gonna look like exactly and if there's gonna be vegan food. From the way you wrote it, it sounds like you immediately jumped to 'I'll bring my own food', which means you did skip that step. It's understandable given how the barbecue was advertised, and it doesn't in any way excuse her behaviour, but maybe a conversation in which you discuss potential issues and solutions would have worked better than a message.

If we get invited to events where there is a chance he can't eat something, he will either eat lots beforehand and pick at some fries at the event or bring his own food - it has never been a problem to other people.\n\nAnyway, I will never understand why people who are threatened by vegans \"pushing their agenda\" are always the first to be so aggressive about how much they love meat. \"Oh you're vegan, I'll just eat my steak raw in front of you hahahaha\" so stupid.", "I feel so bad for the kid.  Doesn't sound like there will be cake or any treats for the kids.  Can you imagine going to a bday party as a kid and being given a hunk of unseasoned chicken and that's it?  Probably she's gonna suffer socially for that.  \n\nPlus - it really can mess you up later in life if you don't learn moderation- if  you never get treats or cake then you don't learn about only eating them sometimes - most of those kids go out and buy all the junk they can when they are old enough to.", "\ud83d\ude02", "I don't get why you're being down voted. Like, I don't 100% agree that she should've shown up. Just because there's the risk of the sister blowing up at her when she gets there which could've made the kid even more sad and confused. But I also don't think showing up for a few minutes is a bad suggestion. Because if the sister doesn't blow up about it then you're right that it would've probably prevented some hurt for the girl. I dunno, it's a sad situation where I don't think OP had any good options, and it's 100% the sisters fault for making the situation that way", "Agreed, like, I don't think she's being shitty for not showing up, but I do agree that it'd probably mean a lot to the niece if OP took her to go do something fun together after having missed the party", "Doesn't seem like a pissing contest from OP's side. It seems more like the sister is trying to have a pissing contest while OP just wants to live her life and eat food that she's personally comfortable eating.\n\nBut, I do agree that she should apologize to her niece. It's shitty that the niece is feeling hurt due to this situation. If the niece has a phone OP should probably have told her that she couldn't make it for the party and offered to make another plan to take her niece somehwhere to celebrate together another day", "To be fair, she did say she is vegan so a lot of normal non-meat BBQ stuff and birthday cake are no go due to milk, eggs, butter, mayo etc. I doubt they had grilled veggies.

Vegan diets have to be strictly monitored by medical professionals if a child or growing teen is going to be on on in order to make sure they aren\u2019t missing out on vital nutrients they need for growth and development. At that age it is much safer to be vegetarian or just to be omnivorous as our bodies intended.", "and if the kids eat everything you prepare for them.  \n\nIf you make a nice vegan burrito bowl and have oreos for dessert and they only eat the rice and the oreos they're gonna have a bad time", "Do you know how many omnivores are nutrient deficient? You\u2019d be surprised bc it\u2019s a lot! Im sure vegan conscious parents (not ED weird fruititarian vegan parents) are actually getting their kids MORE nutrients and vitamins compared to a parent making microwave meals or fast food every day but nobody gives them crap. Even a well balanced omnivore will be vitamin deficient if they stay inside all day or don\u2019t eat the right combo of foods. Food, especially where I am in the US is incredibly nutrient deficient and unhealthy. As a veggie farmer I know even the veg in our grocery stores is nasty, that\u2019s not even stepping in to what meat goes through and how the animals are cared for before they\u2019re killed. Just hate seeing a lifestyle trashed bc people aren\u2019t educated in food systems and stuff :(", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with you but I am pointing out that in order to ensure a child/teen who is vegan is getting the proper nutrients and isn\u2019t deficient their parents would need to take them to the doctor for regular screening! Hence\u2026strictly monitored by medical professionals. You cannot obtain everything your growing human body needs naturally  if you are practicing veganism as a child/teen. You usually end up having to take supplements. This is even true for adults. I was a vegan for several years.

Let's all enjoy it.", "NTA\n\nBringing your own food was a valid compromise.\n\nFurthermore, even as a non vegetarian, her diet sounds super restrictive and not something I'd be thrilled about eating.

I have a couple friends that maybe aren't the best cooks but love to host, so I figured out a system.\n\nHowever, that ship has kinda sailed here, so not really an option.

People with extreme vegan diets are orthorexic and forcing it on their kids, just like an other ED or addiction, ofc that\u2019s bad. But a balanced, sane vegan diet has been proven healthy and fine. I still eat pizza, pasta, junk food etc, but I\u2019m also a veg farmer so I get in a crap ton of good foods. I think cherry picking examples of people who do stuff unhealthy to set an example is bad faith, plenty of omnivores have also ignored their children\u2019s needs and have CPS interventions for diet related issues. I think a lot of people don\u2019t want to confront food systems because it\u2019s an uncomfortable topic and can lead to a lot of conflicting feelings, but no, eating veggies with lots of healthy fats and oils is not going to harm you. I have been vegetarian off and on all of my childhood and committed myself to it since high school, vegan for about 4 years, so no meat for almost a decade and I\u2019m a powerhouse.

But an omnivore diet is a lot more forgiving.  a lot of processed foods are \"fortified\". and cheese/eggs/meats have a lot of nutrients that are harder to get with a vegan diet. I know someone who was a bad vegan for a few months and ended up getting really sick because they were severely deficient in B12 and had to get shots for weeks.", "Not replying with hate either! Just saying the majority of people in the US are nutrient deficient in some way (mostly vit D, hence why I said that about going outside). I think most kids should be screened (and adults) in general but that\u2019s a fault on our healthcare system. Trust, I\u2019ve studied all this thoroughly in school. And the only vitamin you can\u2019t obtain is b12, even then that has to be injected into meat.
