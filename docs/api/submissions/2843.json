She's the daughter of my sister, Ellie (f30).\n\nEllie's always been your 'health nut' type of person, and for the last 3 months she's been sticking to a 'all natural carnivore' diet. She only eats unseasoned meat, eggs or butter and anything else is unacceptable. More power to her because honestly I could never do something like that.\n\nFor my niece's birthday party, Ellie did a barbecue in their backyard. She made it very clear on the invites that all the food will be meat-based and even seemed to brag about it.\n\nI've been a vegetarian since I was 12, and I've been a vegan for 2 years. I'm also kind of a picky eater, which I know can be annoying, it's why I never eat out.\n\nI messaged Ellie and told her I'll bring my own food to the party. Ellie got super offended and said that bringing your own food to a party is rude and told me I can go without food for a few hours. At this point, I'm pretty sure Ellie is just trying to be annoying because she knows I'm vegan. I told her if she's so dead-set on me not bringing my own food to eat then I just won't go.\n\nEllie told me I'm being petty and to just suck it up, and that it's my niece's party and she doesn't need me 'pushing my agenda'. I called her ridiculous and told her if me eating my own lunch at a party upsets her so much she needs to evaluate her priorities. Ellie told me to go fuck myself and said I'm just being sensitive.\n\nI was so mad and ended up not going to my niece's birthday party because it was clear that Ellie didnt want me there and I didn't want to cause drama in front of the kids. Ellie is now pissed at me for not going and said that I really upset my niece and that I'm a terrible aunt. I feel like I can't win in this situation but I'm wondering if I was being an AH and I just cant see it.", "created_utc": 1668994319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0lodh/aita_for_not_going_to_my_nieces_birthday_because/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she didn't want you pushing your agenda but here she is pushing hers on to you by saying you can't bring your own food.", "NTA - It is insanely rude as a host to not make sure there's at least one thing each guest can at least snack on. Nor should any host begrudge someone with very specific dietary needs from bringing their own. Expecting you to watch everyone eat and just hold off for a few hours while she kills kidneys is ridiculous.", "NTA, but she is. You didn\u2019t demand she make a vegan dish, you said you\u2019d bring your own food. What if you had food allergies? Would she still expect you to starve?", "NTA, but your horrible sister is. Sounds like she was the one \"pushing an agenda\" with her weird menu at the party.", "Sounds like she has her own agenda. Makes me wonder who\u2019s being sensitive as well. Probably a good call not going there for the drama. \n\nNTA", "Oof. Her poor colon. NTA.", "NTA. This was a no win situation.  No matter what you did, your sister would have been mad.", "NTA. She knows you don't eat meat and didn't care. You could have maybe asked if you could bring a vegan side dish for everyone to eat if you wanted to be the opposite of an AH, but that's going above and beyond. If she wanted you there, she should have let you bring your own food.", "NTA. There is literally no reason for your sister not to allow you to bring your own food, it doesn't affect anyone else.", "NTA but your sister is. Just like she has dietary restrictions, so do you. If the tides were turned, she\u2019s be bringing her own food. \n\nYou also made no expectations or demands. Knowing your limitations, you were ready to take care of yourself. That makes you a great guest.\n\nI hate to see how she would handle someone lime me with food allergies so severe that exposure could be fatal.", "NTA your sister should be somewhat aware at minimum you\u2019re a vegetarian she should let you bring your own food for that reason alone. What about sisters kids friends? Also Any other guests? She assuming there\u2019s no dairy, peanut, gluten, other allergies? Or is she just assuming they can 1. Not eat while others around them have a nice time and feel excluded  or 2. Somehow just stop having that allergy/issues for the hour. /s.  If you want to have only a certain type of food for an event that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t be surprised when people want/need to bring their own stuff.", "NTA. Ideally if hosting *anything*  let alone a party, you want varied enough food choices that everyone has something they can eat. I get loving meat, but humans (especially kids!) need fruit/veg and such too. \n\nAlso... if your sister preparing a cake for your niece as well? It almost sounds like your sister's against others eating cake too, hehe. That's not as big a deal, but I imagine your niece would at least like some cake too!", "NTA. Your sister is.", "NTA. I can't imagine how the parents of your niece's friends will enjoy sending their little darlings to a carnivore party.", "NTA Your sister is an incentive controlling AH.", "Your sister is an AH. You are NTA in relation to her. No one is gonna want to follow her diet. Most people would want some form of vegetable and carb, even if they love meat. \n\n\nBut, what's your relationship like with your niece? If you guys are close, I'd suck it up and go. If your niece will just view you as one other adult un the background, fine.", "Wow, third keto post today - but this time from the perspective of the non-keto person!", "Gonna go with NTA, since she is overreacting like crazy. Just eating food that aligns with your own preferences isn't 'pushing your agenda' (it would have been if you demanded everyone eat vegan, but that's just ridiculous), and her saying you can go without food is insanely disrespectful. She invited you, she has to provide something to eat and drink or at least accommodate you bringing something else. I don't really see the issue with that either tbh, but honestly there's gazillions of other possible solutions that wouldn't be hard to implement or have a negative effect on the party. So yeah, Ellie was the one escalating the argument into something that's way bigger than it should have ever been, causing you to not attend the party, and now she's calling you a 'terrible aunt'. That's nonsense, you're absolutely not the AH here.\n\nThat being said, I do think you could have brought it up better. Maybe just have a face to face discussion about the party, ask what the meal gonna look like exactly and if there's gonna be vegan food. From the way you wrote it, it sounds like you immediately jumped to 'I'll bring my own food', which means you did skip that step. It's understandable given how the barbecue was advertised, and it doesn't in any way excuse her behaviour, but maybe a conversation in which you discuss potential issues and solutions would have worked better than a message. Especially since it's ultimately about an 11yo girl, who's caught in the middle of a fight that seems totally blown out of proportions. Whatever happens, please make sure she's alright.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour sister has to be constipated from her diet. Maybe that is why she is acting like such an arsehole. Not being able to poop is making her cranky.   \n\n\nI don't see how bringing your own food is unreasonable. She knows that you don't eat meat. It sounds like she didn't really want you to be there. This might have been one of those gift-grabbing situations.", "kinda NTA, kinda ESH. your sister sounds like a stuck up. she shouldn\u2019t have been that way toward you over FOOD. she wasn\u2019t accommodating to you as a sister and that\u2019s why i wanna say NTA. but you at least could\u2019ve stopped by for a minute, said hi to your niece, and left. i understand wanting to avoid drama but it only hurt the little girl", "soft ESH. your sister is a huge A and a terrible\nhost for telling you not to bring your own food and not having anything you can eat. imo, it seems vindictive on your sister\u2019s end. one person eating a pb&j or whatever is not pushing any kind of agenda. \n\nit\u2019s shitty to miss your niece\u2019s party though. she\u2019s only 11 and that kinda stuff matters. you should do something special with her to make sure she knows she\u2019s important to you.", "ESH. She should have been accommodating to your diet, especially since you offered a solution. You could have eaten beforehand and not missed your niece's birthday.", "ESH. Your sister is being ridiculous but you missing only hurt your niece. Both of you need to quit having pissing contests over what type of diet you live on. Go and don\u2019t eat if she doesn\u2019t serve food you like. Or put a snack in the car and walk out and grab when needed. You can return the favor if she ever comes to your place. However you owe your niece an apology.", "ESH\n\nLate entry, but you win the \"what in the yt nonsense did I just read?\" award for the day.", "ESH. What a tempest in a teapot! It's clear that the two of you have some issues to work out. Try to figure it out before the kid gets old enough to notice.", "ESH.\n\nYou shouldn't have taken your anger out on your niece and missed her party because she had nothing to do with you and your sister's argument but your sister *is* being pretty unreasonable on you not being allowed to bring food.", "ESH. You're both acting petty and only the child suffers both of your insufferable diet pettiness.", "ESH \n\nThe day shoulda been about your niece, you both should have put your bickering aside. You didn't have to tell her you were bringing your own food, I just would have done it regardless and not made a big production of it. She sounds extremely annoying though, so I really don't blame you for being reactive to her. That would have pissed me off too.", "YTA!\n\nIt\u2019s your nieces birthday, you should have been there.\n\nIt is rude to bring your own exclusive meal to a party.  Perhaps if you offered to bring a dish or two, TO SHARE, and not making it about YOIR likes you may have gotten a different response.\n\nInstead you made it seem like an ultimatum, and ended up hurting your niece by not bothering to be there.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not like your going to starve to death and drop dead on the lawn because you skipped a meal!", "yta, eat before you go", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
