Definitely wouldn't say I have a problem, never take in more than I'm planning on losing, not betting the mortgage, all that good stuff. Plus I win far more than I lose. I go to Vegas a couple times a year and our local casino town a few times too (always paid for by my winnings and comps, never family money.)\n\nAnyway, during down times this week I of course hit up the casino a few times. My 8 year old asked if I played the \"spinny wheel game\" (roulette) and I told him no, I generally don't play purely luck games like that. \n\nMy older kid asked if he could play and I told him no, he's too young to go in. He asked if I would do a spin for him and of course so did his brother. \n\nI told him sure. They both do chores and have some money. I explained to both of them how it worked, that they would either double their money or lose it all and that it's not exactly 50-50. They both wanted to do it anyway so I said ok. They each wanted $10 on red. \n\nWhen we got back to the hotel my wife pulled me aside and said I should just tell them they both lost so they would have a negative opinion of gambling. That if they won now it would create some positive brain feedback or some crap and would start getting them addicted. She said my \"addictive personality\" could get passed on, which I'm not sure I agree with. \n\nI said no, I'm not going to lie to them and take their money. We compromised and told them they lost (which I know is still lying) but didn't actually take any of their money. \n\nSo AITA for potentially allowing this?\n\nOK, some good responses. Let me clear up a couple things: \n\nI did NOT neglect or ignore my family to gamble. I only hit the casino at night after dinner, when the kids were just in the room watching TV and getting ready for bed. We had 4 full days of family activities and had a great time! \n\nRegarding my gambling activities, all my comps have come from online sports gambling, which I do at home on my phone. I'm up over $30K in 3 years doing this. Every gambling related trip and expense is all done with house money. In fact, a good chunk of this trip was paid for with my winnings. \n\nYes I realize all gambling involves some luck, that's why I specified purely luck based like roulette or slots.\n\nMy wife does not think I have a gambling problem. Addictive personality maybe. \n\nAnd ok, maybe I underestimated the effect a small gamble would have on the kids, but it's not like I was taking them for a whole day or anything. I figured a small $10 bet for fun was nothing major. \n\nI didn't make their bets at all. I told them they lost but didn't take the money out of their accounts.", "created_utc": 1679657071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120hbt7/aita_for_introducing_my_kids_to_a_degenerate/", "score": 787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like an addiction to me. \n\nAnd now you\u2019re passing it to your sons and you\u2019re making it all okay. What are you going to do when they don\u2019t follow the same steps as you when they pick it up? What are you going to do when they\u2019re deep in debt? Or if they make all the wrong moves?

We compromised and told them they lost (which I know is still lying)\n\nPretty high standards for a man so short-sighted who discounts the addictive nature of introducing two children at age 13! and 8! to the conditional joys of gambling.\n\nLike, my guy, you might be dunking on your wife for lying - but you conveniently just \"whatabout\" while ignoring the deeper effects this can and will have on how you raise your kids. Lootboxes in games, scratch tickets at the fair - there is gambling that is specifically catered to kids and you are pushing them into the direction by discounting it as cute little fun because you fell you have control over how much this will affect them.\n\nYou do not.\n\nAnd you sure as hell won't have it, once you realise you lost control.\n\nYTA", "NTA. This man is on vacation and went to the casino a few times as many would. Your kids wanted to join in the fun and gave you $10. If this was all the time, I\u2019d say bad move.

Please get help for this.", "YTA\nDude, there is a reason it's not legal to gamble until you are 18. Your wife is completely right about the positive feedback loop and at their developmental stages they can't yet prevent it from happening or moderate their response to it.

You're at a Caribbean resort and there was nothing else the kids wanted to do besides sit in a hotel room while you hit the casino?

Probably makes more sense to follow her lead on this one & keep your kids away from gambling.", "YTA for lying to them. When I was little cruise ships still allowed kids to play the nickel slot machines in the casinos. My grandfather thought he was going to \"teach us a lesson\" and gave us a handful of nickels to bet with and he thought we'd get frustrated when we lost all our money. We won probably five bucks lol. I still remember the thrill of all those nickels pouring out of the machine lol. He was pissed with himself but we had a blast. And we also didn't turn into addicts. I remember it being so much fun but as I grew up the adults around me taught me about risk and what can happen when you gamble.

I'm great with numbers and was going to school for a dual bachelors/ masters program for math before I fell pregnant with my first child.\n\nMaybe you should tell her nor only is it a learning experience, playing cards with your family can be a great educational moment.", "NTA. My grandpa got to the second to last table in the World Series of Poker Tournament one year and my mom is also a poker player (not professional). I grew up going to Vegas and Laughlin probably 6-8 times a year. I occasionally take my mom out to the local casinos and I have a seriously hard time gambling $50 even though I\u2019m decent at blackjack. It just doesn\u2019t appeal to me the way it appeals to them. \n\nMy mom being a gambler afforded me a lot of luxuries growing up that most kids wouldn\u2019t even dream of. But I also saw how awful people felt when they lost. I know Las Vegas well enough to consider it a second hometown, and because of that I see the city for what it really is. I don\u2019t think you need to hide gambling from them or lie to them about it. But I think you need to also be honest about how it can be addictive and how it can become a truly dangerous vice if people don\u2019t take care.", "NTA - BUT I'd be very careful.

Locations are everywhere and you can put money online, too.

Most people still never are in danger to become addicted. You might think they simply lacked occation, but this seems not to be true. There is a lot of evidence that being a happy, loved and loving person is the best protection, if not the only one, that works properly. Only happy people realise quickly if something makes them less happy or is about to destroy their life. There is evidence, too, that children need to learn what the important things in life are. Like, if you tell them \"it is wonderful to sit here with you eating and talking\" they will see eating together and talking with each other as a good thing for the rest of their life. If you never mention it they will end up considering eating a nice meal and talking as unimportant, or not good enough, and will seek satisfaction in other things which may never seem to be enough. So your biggest task as a parent is to make your boys happy and to let them know that for you they are the most important thing in the whole world. By spending quite an amount of time at the casino during a family vacation you may not achieve this goal. It depends on how your kids see you. Are you an active, wonderful dad who loves spending time with his family? Or are you the one to wait visibly impatient for the kids going to bed so he can sneak away to his \"true love\"? Are you awake and ready to go to the pool the next morning or is your wife the one who gets up early with the kids and takes them to breakfast because you went to bed late and need to sleep till noon? \n\nLetting your kids place a dollar or two will not make them addicted, but feeling neglected can be a first step down. \n\nSo not spending more money than you can spare is great, but spending so much time might be a problem, as a lot of people here already told you. Think about it, and if you come to the conclusion it may affect your family life, better get a grip as long as your children need their dad and want to spend time with both of their parents.
