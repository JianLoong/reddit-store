Definitely wouldn't say I have a problem, never take in more than I'm planning on losing, not betting the mortgage, all that good stuff. Plus I win far more than I lose. I go to Vegas a couple times a year and our local casino town a few times too (always paid for by my winnings and comps, never family money.)\n\nAnyway, during down times this week I of course hit up the casino a few times. My 8 year old asked if I played the \"spinny wheel game\" (roulette) and I told him no, I generally don't play purely luck games like that. \n\nMy older kid asked if he could play and I told him no, he's too young to go in. He asked if I would do a spin for him and of course so did his brother. \n\nI told him sure. They both do chores and have some money. I explained to both of them how it worked, that they would either double their money or lose it all and that it's not exactly 50-50. They both wanted to do it anyway so I said ok. They each wanted $10 on red. \n\nWhen we got back to the hotel my wife pulled me aside and said I should just tell them they both lost so they would have a negative opinion of gambling. That if they won now it would create some positive brain feedback or some crap and would start getting them addicted. She said my \"addictive personality\" could get passed on, which I'm not sure I agree with. \n\nI said no, I'm not going to lie to them and take their money. We compromised and told them they lost (which I know is still lying) but didn't actually take any of their money. \n\nSo AITA for potentially allowing this?", "created_utc": 1679657071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120hbt7/aita_for_introducing_my_kids_to_a_degenerate/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We won probably five bucks lol. I still remember the thrill of all those nickels pouring out of the machine lol. He was pissed with himself but we had a blast. And we also didn't turn into addicts.

Honestly it would probably be cheaper than all my shooting sports. \n\nBut, I do agree about the thing with the kids - don\u2019t lie to them. And don\u2019t introduce them to gambling.", "Something can be not entirely luck based, while still being mostly luck based. Poker having some skill expression doesn't mean that it's not primarily luck that's gonna make the difference. So the point the person you replied to made is completely valid.", "Leaning hard on the \u201cskill\u201d stuff is exactly what people with gambling problems say to justify what they\u2019re doing, especially along with the \u201cI actually make money at it\u201d which is virtually never true.", "What is OP lying or in denial about?\n\nI hope you're not saying he has a gambling problem, the evidence of which is that he's lying and in denial about not having one... Because that would mean the vast majority of people in the world has a gambling problem, as most people would deny having a gambling problem, whether they actually do or not.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He lied to the kids when he pretended to bet their money. It doesn't matter to me that he didn't steal from them to make the lie more believable.", "Pretty much semantics. Casinos prey on the weaknesses of the brain, humans are generally not good at realistically evaluating odds. They only think of the big win they can have, and that pushes away any logic that might make them decide to not gamble. Why would so many people gamble, and casinos make so much profit?\n\nIt's also just scientifically proven that humans are shit at evaluating odds, just in general. It's not something that our brains have evolved to be good at. \n\nIt might not be a scam by definition, but in practice it's pretty much the same.", "It could be an indicator of that, sure. That doesn't mean it 100% is, though, as everyone here seems to be assuming.\n\nPlus, that might just be a reflex borne from people always assuming that, just because he enjoys gambling, that means he has a problem.", "Because on a sub like this as soon as any amount of gambling, drinking, or literally anything that has the potential to be abused is brought up half the users will start claiming the poster is an addict", "I personally agree with you.\n\nNot sure the relevance that has to anything I said in my above comment, though...", "He absolutely could get that many comps just by playing every few weeks/once a month or so.\n\nPlus, frequency of gambling doesn't indicate a problem on its own. It's an unwillingness to stop gambling when you can't afford to keep doing so that indicates an issue. \n\nIf OP goes to his local casino once a week and only intends on spending $20 each time, and sticks to that, well, it's certainly a much more financially sound hobby than most others.", "Really? \nI play once in a while on vacation and get a few comps here and there. He didn\u2019t say he got a lot of comps. But you can be an infrequent player and get the occasional buffet or whatever in Tahoe or Vegas.\nWe mainly gamble on cruise ships and get crazy casino rates, comped premium restaurants, a few gifts like t-shirts or other swag, a few hundred in casino credit, etc.", "And yet, there is always luck involved. You don't control what the other players do. Poker might be slightly less luck based than other gambling but it sure as shit is a game of luck.", "Spending \u201ca few thousand dollars a year there\u201d is a lot to me. That proves my point even more", "Basketball is skill based because there is a ball which is the same for both teams and the nets are of equal heights and dimensions. Now if before every quarter there was a random drawing for a bigger or smaller net and that they are closer or farther away then their is the luck aspect. If poker started with the exact same cards every hand and you needed to use skill to beat your opponents then the luck is taken out of it.", "You must be unfamiliar with games like poker if you don\u2019t understand they involve skill.", "You don\u2019t control what your opponent does in chess either, that doesn\u2019t mean chess is luck-based", "By this logic just about any game is a game of luck.", "Yeah but I feel like it's pretty clear OP meant he doesn't play games that are solely luck based, like slots or roulette.\n\nYes, there's always an element of luck involved, but I don't see any issue with OP clarifying he doesn't play the solely luck based games.", "A lot is relative, considering we don't know anything about his income. To some people, a few thousand is a lot, to others, it's not.\n\nGiven the fact that OP can afford to go to Vegas multiple times a year, and go to a Caribbean resort with his whole family, I think I'm leaning to the a few thousand per year isn't a lot to OP.", "It doesn\u2019t though, a few thousand dollars a year might be this persons play money. Whether or not a few thousands of dollars is a lot to *you* isn\u2019t relevant. I spend a few thousand a year on hobbies, I just don\u2019t find casinos very fun. Without knowing anything else about this persons financial situation, you can\u2019t make a case that he has a gambling problem or is spending unhealthy amounts of money or has an addiction to it.", "I think a lot of this speaks to personal biases as to how OP's gambling is perceived. A lot of people (rightfully) perceive gambling negatively, as it is designed to be addictive and can wreak havoc on a person's finances. The consequences can be very dire indeed. \n\nObviously OP should not be introducing children into the world of casinos and gambling. These should remain as Dad's personal adult hobby. \n\nI'm also very much aware that people tell stories in a way that makes them look best. I would 100% not be surprised if OP does have a problem. \n\nLet me ask a question: if I substituted the OP's gambling with golf trips, boating, hunting, or any other hobby with a similar frequency and cost, would you view it differently? In other words, is it the frequency and cost that bothers you, or is it the activity?", "Maybe a lot to you is not a lot to him.", "Wow, someone who understands what I mean.\n\nEven something like basketball still has some element of luck involved. Your opponent's best players may be injured or sick, the referee is shit and rules in your favour even if he shouldn't, etc. But to say that basketball is determined mainly by luck is obviously ludicrous. Poker however, is mainly determined by luck. Idk what these people's hard on for poker is, I really don't understand it. Either they've barely ever played, got lucky and now think their wins were all skill. Or they're just fellow addicts, who knows.", "It involves both luck and skill.\n\nBut I'd argue it's more luck then skill, if you get a bad hand you get a bad hand and there is a reason for all the laws around it...", "Yeah but in chess both players start out with the same pieces in the same position. It's about as equal as you can get. In poker, you can get straight up unwinnable or unloseable hands from the start.", "How so? Yes, many games have an element of luck involved, the question is how much. In poker, it's a lot. Denying that is pure cope.", "\"An element of luck\", so which games can you play at a casino that aren't at least less than 50% luck based? And how don't people just get rich for free by playing them? \n\nAccording to OPs logic he could become at least a multi millionare, since he always wins more than he loses. So why doesn't he just farm some casino's and retire early? Because obviously it doesn't work like that. Only addicts think it works like that, and obviously casino's want you to think like that.", "Yeah there\u2019s a difference. Gambling is designed to cost you money. It\u2019s designed to let you win enough to keep coming back. It\u2019s designed to waste time. Casinos use situational manipulation to make you loose track of time. \n\nGolf, hunting, boating etc are hobbies that have clear mental health benefits.  They also add exercise and outdoor activities to peoples lives. There\u2019s a clear difference in these. Gambling shouldn\u2019t even be considered a hobby. Card games with friends can be different as it\u2019s a social activity with friends. But casino gambling shouldn\u2019t be considered a hobby", "All games and sports require both luck and skill. You can still win with a bad hand (bluffing)", "If you\u2019d argue that then you clearly know nothing about it and there\u2019s no point listening to you", "Yes poker has a lot of luck. But so does Monopoly, so does the game of Life. Its like one of the best games to learn that even our arc as humans is just a game of chance. You could put in all the effort to have a strategy in these games and still get boned by bad dice rolls or bad spins. \n\nI mean, march madness is also a huge example of this, the upsets that give the NCAA tournament its name occur is because teams that have statistical disadvantages and have less skill overall than their opponents can still win games. Remember when UMBC beat UVA in 2018? It only happened because everything went right for UMBC and everything went wrong for UVA. In other words, *they got lucky.* \n\nI just think that there's no point in differentiating luck based games with non-luck based games. The outcome of every game we play can and will hinge on luck.", "Just because he (thinks) he has won more than he's lost in the past doesn't mean he thinks that will continue to be true.\n\nI don't really understand why you're focusing in on this 'he doesn't play games that are solely luck based' thing.", "Absolutely a huge difference. Gambling is regulated by the government on who\u2019s allowed to do it and their are gambling addicts helplines to call. When there\u2019s a golf or fishing addicts helpline and no on under the age of 18 is allowed to do it then I\u2019ll consider them to be on the same page.", ">But casino gambling shouldn\u2019t be considered a hobby \n\nWhy not? As long as somebody has the self control to not spend more than they're willing to, how is it any different from any other hobby? \n\nLet's say, for example, bowling. That doesn't really get you outdoors, and any physical activity benefit you get from it would be minimal at best. So how is going and spending $20 to bowl for an hour any different than taking that same $20 to a casino for an hour?", "Yeah, those games you mention are also luck based games, so idk what your point is. But more importantly, those games aren't played with real money.\n\nI am not American, and so I have zero idea what you're talking about with the sports, but yes, sports can involve luck. Like I already said though, luck isn't the main factor. It is in poker.", "It wasn't me who started that argument. I just participated in it, idk why you would single me out for that. \n\nAlso, clearly he thinks that will continue to be true. First of all, that notion is just dripping from his post. Secondly, if he doesn't think he will continue winning, why not call his bets and stop while he's ahead? Clearly these gambling trips are a regular thing he does and he shows no signs of stopping that. Which he justifies by saying that they pay for themselves, with his earnings.", "> It wasn't me who started that argument. I just participated in it, idk why you would single me out for that.  \n\nFair enough. I don't really get why anyone is focusing in on that, the fact that some games are more luck based and some games are less luck based, and OP prefers the ones that are less luck based, I don't see how that's relevant to this post at all. \n\n>Secondly, if he doesn't think he will continue winning, why not call his bets and stop while he's ahead?\n\nSome people just enjoy gambling as an activity, win or lose. It doesn't sound like OP gambles to make money, it sounds to me that OP gambles because he enjoys gambling, and any money he gets from it is just the cherry on top."]}
