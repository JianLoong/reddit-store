He said that  he does not feel \"comfortable\" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to having a copy of the key. He also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should \"disqualify her\" from getting the key.

I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. He screamed at me saying that \"technically\" he did contribute towards the house savings back when he used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money.

For our old apartment we gave a key to them and a close friend living nearby. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty handy but really something you need to agree on.", "My in laws have a copy of our house keys for emergencies or to check on the apartment if we leave the country for a long time. They wouldnt dream of using it without informing us beforehand or invading our privacy. But i do understand that not everyone has good in laws or parents", "I have two brothers, one who is married, and I\u2019ve been with my SO for 15 years, and my mom has a key to every single one of our homes. And we all have keys to her home and to each other\u2019s homes. I think it really just depends on the family and the dynamic. We are all really close and help each other out by letting out animals or taking care of the home while a sibling is on vacation. My mom lives three hours away so when she comes up to our city, she always stays with one of us, so it\u2019s easier if she can let herself in if the person is at work when she gets to town.", "my in laws have a key. we originally gave it to them to feed animals when we go on vacation, but its come in handy when we have gotten ourselves locked out. they have never used it without us asking so its been a nice them having a key. It doesn't have to be your parents but someone you know and trust not to take advantage.", "No. Very weird.", "Family members or a trusted neighbor is common because it's good to have a spare key outside of the house in case of an emergency. Key point is that it has to be a trusted person who has it.", "It's quite common for a trusted friend, neighbour or family member to have a spare key in case of emergency. Which is often but now always parents.", "My parent, wife's parents,  her sister, and my brother all live within 20min, and all have \"emergency\" keys", "Yea sure, why not?", "We have keys to our three adult children's homes. Of course we don't go over uninvited nor go thru drawers or closets", "A friend or neighbor has had a key to my house everywhere I've lived. It's not a huge deal, so ESH.", "Not saying it has to be this way, but do you not imagine cases where you need someone to open your home while your not there (water leak while your on vacation, etc)?", "Giving parents an emergency key is extremely normal for many, many people. Why wouldn\u2019t it be? Unless the parent will snoop or steal, I\u2019ve never heard of this being an issue. It\u2019s SOP.", "If I was the kind of person to pay for Reddit awards, I would give you one.  You have slightly improved my outlook on humanity by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve considered other points of view, and I\u2019ve updated my opinion based on that.\u201d", "Probably the husband that did it, wife posted, then husband said they took pity cause female or some other excuse", "Lender doesn\u2019t care who is on the title", "I'm married and my mother and brother have a key to my house and if my MIL and FIL lived close by I'd give them a spare key in a heartbeat. But reading AITA posts makes me feel fortunate in my relationships.\nedit: Meant to respond upthread. My spouse and I discussed it first :)", "No, because usually when people have posts that don\u2019t make sense they\u2019ve left out information for a reason. Either they\u2019re ashamed to type something out, or they\u2019re in denial over something being important, or they want to look good. I don\u2019t know what OP\u2019s angle is or who\u2019s more the asshole, but it seems a solid ESH to me. \n\nTo be clear, I see nothing wrong with most parents getting keys. My parents have a key to my place, my brother\u2019s place literally has the same house key as my parents\u2019 place so I have a key to theirs too. It\u2019s been super helpful to all of us.

Luckily, her MIL, who is retired, had a spare key. \nOur bestman has a spare to our house because he often feeds our cats when we go away on holidays. \nPretty normal to give out spares, but the whole dynamic of OP\u2019s marriage is f**ked. Is it a partnership or not? She\u2019s TA.", "Or let a workman in while we were at work.  On the other hand my BFF's husband gave a key to the in laws and later found out his mom was coming by while they were at work and snooping.", "I gave a set to my in laws just in case anything happens to us, I want to make sure someone can get in the house to take care of our pets.", "I have a rock in my garden that has a compartment where I keep my spare key. I have had to use it on occasion. It works great.", "This is exactly my reasoning as well. My parents being 15 min away is pretty handy.", "Yeah, it definitely depends on the individual.  My dad had a key to my house, my mom did not.  Dad would let himself in to take care of our dogs while we were away and maybe to sneak in a movie on our big TV.  Mom would have let herself in to rummage around for cash and for general snooping.", "This house should be in both your names and you need to discuss with your spouse before giving anyone a key.", "Completely reasonable, but also completely reasonable to want to be involved in discussions about who has a key to your house.", "I'm currently using the key to my ex and his wife's house to get the mail and look for any issues while they are out of the country. (It used to be to feed their cats.) They also have mine for cat care. We live 6 blocks apart and have had this situation for 15 years or more.  Her daughter has a key, but lives further and she'd have to wrangle two toddlers to get the mail. Parents aren't an option at this point. It's a homeowner convenience situation and nothing else, and the keys are never used otherwise.", "Reading all these comments makes me realize that I am unusual and I hand out my keys like they are party favors. I have 4-5 neighbors who have my keys and I have theirs, my parents, siblings, a few friends, cleaning lady, dog walker, etc all have keys. Have had zero issues with boundaries.\n\nA few weeks ago, one of my neighbors locked themselves out and contacted me because they couldn't remember if I had a key or not. I hadn't remembered either but showed up with all the various keys that could have potentially been theirs and one set was. Lol...still have a bunch of mystery keys.", "Just had an incident about a week ago where an acquaintance, who is in their 90s and lives alone, fell and couldn't get back up.  Luckily, a neighbor noticed something amiss and was able to use their spare key to get in.", "In all fairness she didn't bring it up until he kept mentioning that her mother didn't contribute at all towards the house.

Then technically there was a discussion...", "Legally, purchased during the marriage with marital funds\u2026..it\u2019s a marital asset even if only in her name.\n\nETA: In the US", "There may be exceptions in an abusive relationship. This one may not be abusive but does sound pretty toxic.", "Absolutely. Also it depends on the relationship between the mom and the husband. Everything might be OK with mom and OP but not with mom and husband and OP is not willing to accept it. Unless husband has some credit issue by which he couldn't have the house in his name or something, husband should just leave OP.

I was livid.", "Ohhh no! Yeah depends on what your parents are like lol imagine that!", "I can't help but wonder if the fact that she bought the house without him makes him uncomfortable/insecure?", "Maybe the problem is that she didn\u2019t give her husband a key \ud83d\ude02  I don\u2019t think this is gonna be one of those \u201ctill death do we part\u201d marriages", "Unless the MIL is a hot cougar, that is\u2026", "Lmao I know myself. I would 100% take that key into the house, put it down thinking \"ehh I'll put it back later\" ... and then next time I locked myself out be absolutely effed lol.", "Maybe he objected because OP didn't even consider discussing it with her husband. She just made a unilateral decision about a place they both live in.", "That\u2019s possible but lots of partners object to normal parent things because of their own issues.", "OP might also have issue with the fact he's not on the deed to the house at all and now the wife is making these one sided decisions and declaring 'my house, my rules; suck it' like a trump card.", "Even if he's not on the title, he will definitely have homestead rights in the property.", ">In all fairness she didn't bring it up until he kept mentioning that her mother didn't contribute at all towards the house.\n\nThat we know of. I suspect he specifically used that wording because it's been rubbed in his nose so many times that he can't do x or have a say in x because he didn't \"contribute to the house\"  \n\n>And we don't know if his name was left off the title, we just know she bought it.\n\nOp can clarify, but it stands to reason that she is able to lord the house over him *because* his name is not on the deed. \n\n> A person can buy a house themselves and still have someone else one the title as well.\n\nNo smart person does this, though.", "Yeah, she 'bought the house herself' because he handled all the expenses while she saved. Money being fungible, he did in effect help in funding that house.\n\n>He screamed at me saying that \"technically\" he did contribute towards the house savings back when he used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money.\n\nSo her saying she's the one who bought the house is a half-truth, because she wouldn't have saved up nearly as fast if she was still paying rent & other expenses.", "Applies to most Canadian provinces too.", "I\u2019m kinda glad neither the OP or their partner is *my* partner tbh.", "He will have homesteads rights in the land even without being on title", "My dad has my brother's spare key, he doesn't even carry it with him, it's at his house and only for emergencies.. if we're invited to my brother's house, we knock like everybody..", "Her husband's experience with her mother might not be the same as hers.", "I have a key to my daughter\u2019s home.  She always laughs when I knock before entering, because she and her husband walk right into my house. It just feels important to show respect, especially towards my son in law, to knock first.  I believe (certainly hope!) most parents of grown couples feel the same way.", "You have to remember that each family views boundaries differently. Mom might respect boundaries but does that mean not going into their room when she stops by and no one is home?", "I don\u2019t like that OP\u2019s mom requested the key. She gave a good reason for the request, but this should never be something anyone asks for. That makes me wonder if OP\u2019s mom actually does have appropriate boundaries.", "People are allowed to have boundaries. I have Autism and I need to control who has access to my spaces. So I would not want anyone outside the house to have a key. Maybe he feels a lack of security because of the potential of wrongdoing. Likely or not, he is allowed to be uncomfortable. Because maybe it gets stolen and then someone else breaks in.", "It definitely would make me uncomfortable. According to OP, her husband paid rent and took care of expenses which she saved up for the house. And the she plays the my house my rules card. For anything any small reason she can just kick her husband out iirc.", "Lmao!! I'm the same way, so I have to make myself put the key back before I even open the door after unlocking it. Lol", "OP might have a history of defaulting to her mother when making decisions and her husband might be frustrated with that dynamic because it\u2019s inappropriate to put a parent over a spouse when it comes to decisions that directly affect one\u2019s marriage and life with their partner.", "TBH, this seems like such a normal thing to do that I don't even see a reason to discuss it. I would totally expect any relatives or close friends that live nearby to receive keys. Maybe this is just a case of having very different expectations.", "Where I live she\u2019d need to be careful lording it over him too much. Any house bought during the marriage and used as a family home is automatically split in the divorce so he could force a sale out of spite.", "True, it could have been a repeated attitude. However we can only go off what we are told, anything else is speculation and often changes the facts of the matter.\n\nAs for no smart person would add someone else to the title if they are the only ones buying it, you are mistaken. It happens all the time, especially in single income homes. Both of my grandparents are examples right off the top of my head, as well as my parents. My grandmothers didn't work, but their names were on the titles of their homes. My mother did work at the time they got married but the first mortgage was in dad's name only, while the title was in both of theirs. Later, when they refinanced, the mortgage was in both of theirs. The flip side to this is my ex insisted that his name be left off the title, because he wanted to make sure the kids and I always had a home even if something happened to him, or if we got divorced (we divorced 20+ years later). Now if someone starts a new relationship and immediately adds them to the title as soon as they move in, then yes that's a dumb move. But to add a spouse or child to the title is quite common especially in estate planning.", "I agree. I addressed this in my comment and judgement of OP, if you'd like to take a look and let me know your thoughts.", "Thanks for clarifying that, I didn't know this.", "I have a family member with a house key and car key.  This is normal behavior, they would never consider using the key to enter my home or use my car.  I expect it is in their safe or a safe place.", "We have spare Keys of all my aunts at my grandma house. Never been used, yet.", "So many people have a blind spot for their own families boundary crossing behaviour. Either because they think it\u2019s normal or they make excuses about it, but ultimately even if she\u2019s the most respectful human on the planet it should have been a discussion because it\u2019s their house and both partners should be comfortable.", "If OP is correct that mom respects boundaries, then it\u2019s extremely normal for family members to have a key for emergencies. \n\nDifferent people have different experiences; I\u2019m used to the model where families look out for each other and definitely would be a safe person to leave a key with. If I lived in the same city as my mom she would have a key, and I would find it extremely odd if my spouse objected. \n\nWhich, he has the right to object and obviously has his own perspective. But he doesn\u2019t seem to understand the \u201cfamily as safe person\u201d concept. Perhaps someone in his family is not safe in that way.", "No, he lives there. She can't just kick him out, but I don't understand why he's not on the deed.", "Though she did say she started saving for the house before she even met him.", "If it was bought during the marriage and the registered home of both it would mean she can\u2019t do that where I live. If she locked him out or changed the locks he could have her charged with a crime. He\u2019d also get half in a divorce.", "I wonder, if they got divorced, the home would be half his since it was bought during their marriage?", "When you're in what's supposed to be a lifelong relationship, you learn to discuss things that you assume are normal, because you realize everyone has a unique life experience.", "It is a normal thing. Both my in-laws and parents have our key. But there was a discussion, nobody made unilateral decisions, even if the discussion was a simple \"Q: So we're giving your parents and my parents the key? A: Yes\".\n\nIt's like making plans that includes your spouse with a group of friends. Although I know he'll want to do the activity and has the time, I still ask him about it, it seems like the considerate thing to do.", ">True, it could have been a repeated attitude. However we can only go off what we are told\n\nThat's a perfectly valid opinion, and I respect that. In that case, there's nothing more to be said without the op's input as neither of our assumptions can be definitively correct. \n\n>Both of my grandparents are examples right off the top of my head, as well as my parents.\n\nI'll concede that the homeowners in your life are very generous and thankfully, things have worked out for them. \n\nI mostly had the more recent trend of couples that divorce in mind when I made that statement.", "We store an extra car key at my parents, because my husband has incredibly severe ADHD and I'm more prone than a normal person to losing things. \n\nI can tell you we've needed that spare key lol", "I have like 4 different people's spare keys in my house. Never used a single one of them.", "Yeah I have an extra key for my best friends moms house because she lives like 5 minutes from me. If I go over to see her, I ring the bell. I've used the key only a couple of times, once she asked me to let in guys delivering a fridge and another time I dropped off a package when she wasn't home and I didn't want to leave it out in the rain. I asked if she minded if I came in and put the package on the counter before I did it. \n\nIt amazes me that people use an \"emergency\" key to let themselves in whenever they feel like it.", "The fact that her mother requested it does not seem at all to me like she actually respects boundaries. OP deciding to give it to her mother without her mother requesting it is normal. \u201cHey mom, can you hold onto a spare key for us?\u201d is much different than the mom asking for it.", "I've just never been in a relationship where that was even a topic of discussion. Both people get half the keys, and obviously at least one key is given to a close nearby relative, and then the other person is informed about who got the key. The only reason I could imagine this being an issue is if there was previous bad blood with that nearby relative, which OP doesn't mention."]}
