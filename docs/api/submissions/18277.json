He didn't say anything at the time but waited until we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said \"why?!\" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. He said that  he does not feel \"comfortable\" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to having a copy of the key. He also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should \"disqualify her\" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but he kept insisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me upset. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. He screamed at me saying that \"technically\" he did contribute towards the house savings back when he used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told him that he was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for his opinion and keep undermining his input.\n\nWe've been going back and forth on it since then. He's now \"letting me know\" that if I don't take the key back then he'll do it herself. I think he's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key.

It\u2019s normal not to want your in laws to have a key to your home", "Yta- if the only reason you were able to save is because he was supporting you ,then yes yta.", "I suppose that might make sense, but wouldn't the home owner need to be there before a contractor would start repairs? To get authorization from them, sign a contract and such?\n\nI think my vote would be a soft YTA. Maybe OP's husband just has a problem with MIL. I would think they both should agree on who gets the emergency key.", "Totally fair point and absolutely right actually, the husband wouldn't have used that otherwise.", "Yeah see how well that technical stake of ownership flies in any sort of court. He put no money down, house isn\u2019t in his name, if that\u2019s the standard he wants to hold the mom to then he better get ready to be held to the same standard.", "My thoughts, exactly. LOL", "Did you not know that everything before the \u201cbut\u201d in a statement is basically nonsense. It is their home, and her husband has the right to peaceful existence which obviously doesn\u2019t include having a key to his home given out.", "Married people normally consult each other before handing out keys to the house.\n\nActually, anyone who lives together usually consults each other before giving out house keys!", "Having somebody outside the family having a key to the house for emergencies (locking yourselves out, for example, or handling a burst pipe when away for a while) I don't see as unusual, and that person being a parent doesn't seem odd.\n\nA fee pass to enter the property whenever they wish is another matter, however.", "I did. Because when I lock my keys in the house it is a lot easier for my dad to come over from 8 minutes away with their spare, than it is from my husband to leave work and make the 50 minute commute home to let me in", "Where I am from, yes. It is so normal that my husband and I didn't even discuss it, it was more like, so besides our parents who needs a key for emergencys?", "It's normal to give a spare key to someone. My parents have given a spare key to their long-standing next door neighbours. I live too far away for it to be practical to keep one, but if I lived close to them, I'm sure we would have each others spare keys.\n\nI wouldn't give a spare key to anyone, parents or otherwise, who would use it instead of ringing the doorbell in a non-emergency. The OP says her mother is respectful of her privacy so who knows what the story is there.", "My mom has a key of our house. No way in hell my in-laws would. Husband totally agrees with this.\n\nMy mom has a key in case she is the one picking up our daughter from school because we\u2019re both working late. Since we both work 30-45 minutes from where we live, my mom can\u2019t swing by our workplace to pick up our key before picking our daughter up. It\u2019s easier for her to have it.", "I would consider it common practice to make sure someone has a key in the event of a emergency.", "My in laws have a key to our house as they live locally, so they have checked on the house for us when we were away, looked after our kids, etc, my mum doesn't have a key as she doesn't live locally.", "In my family, yes, because my MIL is great. I wouldn\u2019t give my FIL a key because he\u2019s not in very good mental nick, but he doesn\u2019t want one anyway.", "I\u2019m married and we own a house and yes my husbands mom has a spare key and then both of our best friends have keys.", "My mom does. She has our kids while we are at work and it\u2019s come in handy a couple of times.", "Depends if they live local. But it is useful to have some one trusted with access especially if you have pets. Something like a flood is manageable early on or if you both get hospitalised. Parent or neighbour usual choice.", "I would say it is typical to have one family member outside of the house have a key to the house. My parents have keys to probably all of my nearby siblings houses for dog sitting or if someone got locked out. BUT the decision of who that family member should be decided by both OP and her husband. OP is YTA for claiming she paid for the house on her own when he subsidized her living for years previously.", "Depends on the location of the parents? My in laws have a key because they live 15 min away and we want another copy out there w trusted people who can help us out of a pinch if needed", "Estimates and assessments have to be done before repairs can be started.  Person with key can give the insurance adjusters / vendors access to the property so that the paperwork gets done quickly.\n\nWe have a lockbox on our front porch with a combination lock on it.   That might be a good solution for OP's situation.", "Legally yes. But morally yes he did contribute with helping op pay", "Ngl I'm confused on whose side are you.", "THIS...dont care if there is 1 name or not....you are a married couple and you dont give out a key to your home without agreement...definitely wife is an asshole here", "I'm thinking OP is hiding something about her mother and her husband. Like if all is fine between them, then I don't see why husband would object.", "This makes sense. OP should definitely clarify why her husband is not comfortable with MIL having key. Walking unannounced if husband is naked is definitely a reason but I'm wondering if there's anything else.", "Yeah, my mom & my in-laws have keys. My dad doesn't because I don't consider him trustworthy.", "ESH pretty sure that\u2019s self explanatory. They all suck. She sucks for pulling the \u201cit\u2019s *MY* house, I\u2019ll do what I want\u201d. He sucks for threatening to take the key back from her mom, and finally her mom sucks for asking for the key in the first place. Everyone sucks in this situation.", "I mean, OP says her mother respects boundaries. If that's true, having a key doesn't mean just walking in. My mom has a key to our house & always texts us that she's on her way & knocks before coming in. It's very convenient having people with spare keys nearby, as long as they're trustworthy & respectful.", "Not really sure husband sucks here, imagine paying rent and expenses till OP saves for the house and he doesn't even get equity in house and then OP pulls the my house my rules and completely disregards the husbands contribution.", "It was him losing his cool and threatening to remove the keys from her mom. You don\u2019t go threatening shit like that.", "He didn't threaten with harm Jesus. Most he would have done is changed the locks and one key for him and OP."]}
