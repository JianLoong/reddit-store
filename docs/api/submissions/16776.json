{"id": 16776, "submission_id": "13clcfy", "title": "AITA for planning to move out of state for college, leaving my single mother sister alone?", "selftext": "I (18f) have a twin, Mary. We don\u2019t have any more siblings. Mary got pregnant when she was 14. She couldn\u2019t find the father to tell him she was pregnant and he is still nowhere to be seen.\n\nWe have lived with our parents in a 2 bedroom apartment for nearly a decade now. So when Mary gave birth, her baby had to stay in our room. My parents worked more so they could provide for the baby so it was mostly Mary and I at home taking care of her baby. If I wasn\u2019t at school, my parents would demand that I go home and help my sister with her baby. I had no life, no privacy and no love or attention since my sister had her baby. I know obviously the baby and mother take priority but I felt so alone. At 14-15, it was very hard for me to come to terms with my parents not asking me how I\u2019m doing anymore, not congratulating me on my achievements, coming to my games, taking care of me when I\u2019m sick etc. I became resentful of Mary and my parents but I did a pretty good job at never showing them that. I knew the feeling would pass and it did by the time I was 16.\n\nI got at a job at 16 so I had some time to myself outside of school and my niece. My parents then coerced me to contribute almost 80% of wages to help Mary take care of her baby. I\u2019ve always been a pushover so I couldn\u2019t say no, especially because Mary and the baby did actually need that money. Most of the money my parents made was going to bills, rent and car payments. \n\nAnyway, i told my parents I got into a very good college out of state on a near full scholarship and that I\u2019m planning to go. They asked how I can think it\u2019s ok to just leave them to take care of Mary\u2019s baby. I asked why I should stay in a shared bedroom with my sister and young niece for my college years? They said not everything is about what I want and sometimes people make sacrifices for family as they are doing. Mary jumped into the conversation by saying she wouldn\u2019t go off to another state and leave me a single mother alone if the roles were reversed. I said she isn\u2019t alone, our parents are here. She said it\u2019s not the same because they\u2019re always gone for work.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683626963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13clcfy/aita_for_planning_to_move_out_of_state_for/", "score": 598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Feel no guilt.", ">Mary jumped into the conversation by saying she wouldn\u2019t go off to another state and leave me a single mother alone if the roles were reversed\n\nI highly doubt that. Someone so selfless wouldn't ask you to drop your dreams to take care of their baby and their problem.\n\nI get your parents are tight on money at the moment but its not your problem to deal with. \n\nNTA\n\nJust curious. Does Mary have a job?", "NTA.  But make sure you hide anything to do with your scholarship and college acceptance so that they cannot do something to cause you to lose your scholarship.   Start hiding your money, stop giving it to your sister, she chose to have a baby at 14, she needs to care for her child and pay, not you, the baby is not your responsibility.  Do you have a friend you can leave your documents with, birth certificate etc?  That way they can't be hidden from you.  Start storing the things you want to take with you somewhere else if you can, that way if they try to stop you leaving all the things you really need will be secure somewhere else.", "NTA at all, Im so proud of you for working hard and finding a way out of this towards a great new future! You've shown so much maturity and Im so sorry your parents and sister have taken so much advantage of you and taken you for granted.   \nMaybe they won't forgive you (right away) but maybe this will force them to find a new way of being, your sister really needs to step up and the baby should be around 4 now so absolutely no excuse for her to not find a job etc.  \nWishing you the very best of luck and I hope you have an amazing time at college and a wonderful life.", "You didn\u2019t get pregnant at 14, and therefore have no sacrifices to make. Go to school and don\u2019t even think about staying for these people.", "Just make sure you inform your school and scholarship people that no one is to email or call on your behalf about withdrawing your admission or scholarships. I would also look for another place for any school related mail to be sent. Right now your parents and sister are desperate. NTA", "NTA. Tell her to look after her own damn child like the rest of us do. Live your life for you and don't let someone else's mistakes bring you down. Please take the scholarship.", "NTA \n\nAre you still working? Stop giving Mary any money at all. That is your money that you earned. You are going to need it.

It's time for you to have your own life that revolves around you and your future - you didn't have a baby, she did.\n\nIf they really believe in that whole sacrifice and compromise for family, then it's time for them to return the favor and support you.", "NTA she decided to have a baby it\u2019s her responsibility to raise her.

Go and take advantage of this opportunity and don't let them guilt you into staying.", "NTA\n\nYou made enough sacrifice already. Go and live your life!", "NTA.

Tell me, how many times Mary or your parents sacrificed themselves so you would have free weekends and spend time with your friends.

Go and have the best time investing in yourself.. you more than deserve that", "Mary really has it made. Three people to financially support her and her baby, and babysitters at her beck and call.

They will come crawling back when Mary needs something, guaranteed. But you will have freedom", "NTA - take that scholarship and get the hell out. It's time for your parents to...idk...parent? And for Mary to step up and also parent. Not your baby, not your problem.", "Oh hell no. Get out of there. It's impressive that you've managed to earn a near full scholarship despite being forced to share a room with your sister and a baby. These people will suck the life out of you if you give them the chance. They've already stolen your high school years, don't let them steal your college years. All the best for your future! NTA", "NTA. You are well within your right to go. Your sister and parents should be happy for you. If I were your sister, I would be encouraging you to go out and build a future for yourself.

They are just not willing to do that.", "NTA. \nLeave as quickly as you can, and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA. Go live your life. You don't have to be responsible for other peoples doings.

Enjoy every moment and have a great time meeting new friends.\nMary's  problems are not your concern.", "NTA\n\nYou've done way more for Mary than can be reasonably expected from a child already. Besides, you're not leaving Mary alone, you're leaving her with her parents. That's three people to care for the baby.", "NTA Run Run Run. Go get your education and don't look back. Your sisters issues are hers and your parents. She literally Fucked Around and now she is finding out. Its a sad situation but you shouldn't have to sacrifice your future because of your sister and her baby.", "NTA\n\nYou have to live your life, not Mary\u2019s. Mary needs to learn to manage on her own, she could get a job in the evening when your parents are home or a work from home job.", "NTA. Go to that college and move on with your life, but once you get through it all and get a career established, just be ready for them to put their hands out again for support. That's up to you whether or not you want to help, but at this point I wouldn't continue to help. Sounds very selfish on their end.", "NTA. Not going to college (especially on a large scholarship) is a decision that will impact your entire life. It's time to start living for yourself, especially as the baby is getting closer to pre-school age so they don't have the excuse. \n\nHeck, try framing it as \"well I'm hoping the degree will give me a good job so I can help more in the future.\"\n\nAnd then don't come back.", "NTA.\n\nYou have seemingly sacrificed your high school experience for a baby that is not your responsibility. It is not your fault that your sister got pregnant so young, and I am so incredibly sorry that your parents and family have failed to realize that. I know it is tough, but a new door has opened and you need to use it. It is time to take care of yourself and live your life for you.", "NTA.  Taking care of yourself through the betterment of your life is a good thing,  Life will take you a lot of places, just hold onto your seat and enjoy the ride.", "NTA. How can they think it's okay to force you to give up your life for Mary's baby?", "NTA it's not your job to take care of your sister's mistakes. Go to college, get out of that house and DONT look back! It's time Mary learns you're not her kid's other parent", "NTA. Is Mary working to provide for her child also? Or are your parents taking care of both? Has she looked for assistance? Child care assistance? There's a lot of help out there for young single mothers that will take some of the load off your parents.", "NTA...\n\nPretend you're gonna stay and then disappear and go to college. \n\nSounds like the parents will sabotage you so you'll stay and help. \n\nYour sisters child isn't your responsibility, you didn't get pregnant at 14 she did. \n\nPlease be very careful going forward. Get to college and live your life but be prepared for them to throw a fit over this.", "NTA\n\nTime to focus on your own life. She (and your parents by not educating her better) f\u2019ed up and got herself into that kind of responsibility, she can\u2019t demand you to partake in her responsibilities and sacrifice your life for her poor choices.\n\nCongrats on the scholarship.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is your parents responsibility, her child is her responsibility.\n\nGo and enjoy your life. Nuff said.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been making sacrifices for 4 years, having to share a room look after the child and give them most of the money you make. Mary\u2019s poor life choices are not your problem. In this day and age I\u2019m sure she could track the father down if she really wanted to. Get out of there as fast as you can and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA Please go and live your life. It is not your fault your sister got pregnant or that your parents are allowing her to do nothing.

You need to think about your own future.\n\nGo.", "NTA.. go get your degree and work hard to make YOUR life as comfortable and happy as you can.", "NTA at all.\n\nYou need to take care of yourself and your future first. In principle you'll be better able to offer support once you have an education and are able to get a better paying job. \n\nDon't let your family hold you back on this one.", "NTA at all! Take this amazing opportunity and get out of there. The child is not your responsibility. Mary is not your responsibility. Your parents\u2019 bills are not your responsibility. You have been parentified, exploited, and ignored for years and now that you have the chance to get out, go. Live your life and have new experiences and enjoy the freedom and chaos and pain and joy of being an adult, free from the constraints that were placed on you too young. \n\nMary has your parents if she still needs help, and the baby won\u2019t be a baby forever. They must already be at least 3-ish, so in a couple of years hopefully Mary will have an opportunity to get an education or job that she enjoys while her child is at nursery or school. But whatever her decisions and choices are, it\u2019s not on you to make them possible. You\u2019ve done more than your share in this situation and it\u2019s time for you to have your own life. Enjoy it!", "NTA. \n\nLeave these people behind, they'll survive and they've already made your teenage years all about them. Your parents just aren't that into you, and it's all about Mary and her needs. \n\nThink to any time in the last few years where you've needed support, love or attention. Have they been there for you? If the answer's no, then what happens in twenty years time when you're working a minimum wage job because you didn't get to go to college on a scholarship because you had to look after your sisters kid and you ask them to make up the last twenty years because you sacrificed for the family and now it's time for the family to sacrifice for you? I take it you'll be on your own. \n\nYour life can't be about Mary, and they've already co-erced you into giving all your money to her. Live your own life, you aren't a babysitter and cash cow for your sister.", "NTA.\n\nYou are now old enough to be in colleague. She is now old enough to be solely responsible for her own child.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you are forced to become the co parent to this child. It doesn\u2019t make sense that your parents had to work extra but still need 80% of your pay to cover for her expenses. Does she work or anything? Sell photos of her feet at least?", "Your niece is 4 now correct? Are there any programs that offer pre-school so Mary could at least work and get out of the house? This isn\u2019t healthy for her either. But NTA, as some have suggested; take steps to protect your scholarship and admission. Also most colleges offer mental health and support services (included in your tuition fees) I recommend seeking that out and taking advantage. You seem to be handling things as well as possible. But after the last few years, college is going to be a huge adjustment to what you have been doing in high school. And the a counselor can hopefully help you work through these feelings of guilt.", "NTA  \n\n\nThey robbed your highschool experience... Don't let em rob your prime!", "NtA, the kid is 4years old not a baby! You are not the parent of the child or grandparent.

More a child than a baby, at what point could you actually have a life of your own if not now.", "NTA.  Time for the rest of the family to \u201cmake sacrifices\u201d for you.  You\u2019ve done more than your share.  Get out of there and go live your life.", "NTA. GO GO GO. You've been neglected enough. Choose for yourself and for your future. You really deserve it.", "NTA", "NTA. Go to college, learn, have fun, and live your own life. Save every penny you earn - you\u2019ll need it.", "Eek, run away. NTA, OP. Give them time to figure themselves out while you find yourself and your own life. If you want to come back and support them a little do that. But don't do it because they're guilting you into it", "NTA and Mary gets ZERO say. She ruined her life with your parents support and now she wants to ruin yours. Run far and fast.", "NTA. \n\nYou busted your buns to get this scholarship.  Take it and run with it, OP.  If you let it go, you\u2019re going to be miserable and living on the daydreams of what could have been.  Your sister can start pulling more weight to take care of her child and your parents can go ahead and help her if they want to. \n\nAll and all, I am rooting for you!  Go to college, get a degree, and live your best life!", "NTA, this almost sounds like a cultural expectation and I\u2019m not sure what cultural you are, but it\u2019s not fair to you to have to be forced to stay with your sister forever. Your niece sounds like she\u2019ll be going to kindergarten soon and that\u2019ll give your sister plenty of time to work while her kids in school. I would continue pointing that out that your niece will be going to school soon and your sister will be able to work while she\u2019s in school.\n\nIn the meantime:\n\n-Open a separate bank account in ONLY your name. Because if you opened it at 16, your parents have access to your money and can legally empty your account. Credit unions have no fees so I would go with a credit union. \n\n-go online to Experian and Transunion and freeze your credit. This will keep places from running your credit score for loans etc. Your parents and likely sister may have access to your social security number and can open credit cards and buy a vehicle under your name. It would be fraud if they did but if your sister has a history of stealing, I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. You\u2019ll have to continually unfreeze your credit to get a credit card, car, student loan etc. but immediately re-freeze it. Many people do this, including myself so get used to blocking and unblocking access to your credit.\n\n-contact the school and scholarship provider to let them know that nobody else is allowed to make decisions on your behalf so your family doesn\u2019t try to sabotage you.\n\n-make sure to grab your social security card, birth certificate, and any forms of ID. You will need these for many things including housing and it\u2019s easier to grab the originals than order new ones.\n\n-assume nobody is going to help you and prepare financially for that. Prepare to find a bus ticket to the out of state school. If you have a car, make sure it\u2019s only in your name or they can legally take it from you. If it\u2019s not in your name, you\u2019d need your joint title holder to sign over the car to your name, so you might end up with no car.", "1.\tLock down your scholarship with a password at your school.\n2.\tTalk to your school to make sure they won\u2019t cancel anything if your mom or sister try something \n3.\tCreate a new separate checking account so your parent don\u2019t have access to it, so they can\u2019t take any money that you deposit from your scholarship or earnings.\n4.\tCreate a P.O.

We don\u2019t have any more siblings. Mary got pregnant when she was 14. She couldn\u2019t find the father to tell him she was pregnant and he is still nowhere to be seen.\n\nWe have lived with our parents in a 2 bedroom apartment for nearly a decade now. So when Mary gave birth, her baby had to stay in our room. My parents worked more so they could provide for the baby so it was mostly Mary and I at home taking care of her baby. If I wasn\u2019t at school, my parents would demand that I go home and help my sister with her baby. I had no life, no privacy and no love or attention since my sister had her baby. I know obviously the baby and mother take priority but I felt so alone. At 14-15, it was very hard for me to come to terms with my parents not asking me how I\u2019m doing anymore, not congratulating me on my achievements, coming to my games, taking care of me when I\u2019m sick etc. I became resentful of Mary and my parents but I did a pretty good job at never showing them that. I knew the feeling would pass and it did by the time I was 16.\n\nI got at a job at 16 so I had some time to myself outside of school and my niece. My parents then coerced me to contribute almost 80% of wages to help Mary take care of her baby. I\u2019ve always been a pushover so I couldn\u2019t say no, especially because Mary and the baby did actually need that money. Most of the money my parents made was going to bills, rent and car payments. \n\nAnyway, i told my parents I got into a very good college out of state on a near full scholarship and that I\u2019m planning to go. They asked how I can think it\u2019s ok to just leave them to take care of Mary\u2019s baby. I asked why I should stay in a shared bedroom with my sister and young niece for my college years? They said not everything is about what I want and sometimes people make sacrifices for family as they are doing. Mary jumped into the conversation by saying she wouldn\u2019t go off to another state and leave me a single mother alone if the roles were reversed. I said she isn\u2019t alone, our parents are here. She said it\u2019s not the same because they\u2019re always gone for work.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
