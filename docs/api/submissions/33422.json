Now he won't talk to me. \n\nBackground. I've been the main cook for this family for 17 years (I'm 40y). We have five kids, he is nearly 50y and he rarely cooks, but he is capable of cooking. 7 days ago I had a total hip replacement (planned) I'm on crutches and a lot of pain meds. He is my carer. \n\nYesterday 7pm he said he would start cooking dinner. I was concerned, and starving, and I asked him what dinner was. He said he was defrosting FROZEN chicken breast (for a Hello Fresh meal). \n\nTo set the scene, the lunch he served was 1/2 small plate of broccoli and sweet potato, no protein. Breakfast was a banana and a cuppa - I had to ask for 1 slice toast. So by 7pm, I was starving, helpless, and in pain. \n\nWhen he said frozen chicken, I yelled, \"I know there's food in the fridge please just bring something!\"\n\nPlan B was microwave lasagna leftovers which a neighbor delivered the day before, which he \"cooked\" (ie threw in the oven). Lacking protein, I started yelling again, \"I can't believe you can't find something proper, 17 years & I can't even trust you feed me?\"\n*Edit - lasagna is Woolworths brand basic lasagna. Not homemade. Neighbor was very kind to deliver it but not high in protein. \n\nHe got mad saying \"Don't you want food? I am offering chicken or lasagna with salad, what more do you want? How are you mad, I am offering you a choice!\"\n\nI felt betrayed, disappointed, and unloved. But I needed to eat, so I told him lasagna. He served it, I eat and I go to bed.\n\nAfter 30min, I'm still mad so I texted him:\n\"I didn't think I would have to spell it out, feeding a person is not difficult. Your \"plan\" of defrosting frozen chicken at 7pm is fucking ridiculous. \nPlease have a nutritious meal for me tomorrow. The trust I had for you has been going for a while now, but this is a huge low. And for you to throw a fit and try and make me look like the crazy one- fuck you if you can't apologize.\"\nEdit* yes I realise how awful this was. But I'm mad. And I wanted real feedback, so being honest. I usually don't speak like this. But yes the resentment is growing for more reasons, this is just an example... \n\nHe says nothing and completely ignores the text message. This morning, he goes to work as planned, my 16yo daughter is caring for me during the day, she feeds me well. He comes home at 6pm. Still no apology.\n\nHe makes the chicken dinner tonight (he defrosted it last night). Brings it to me and then he leaves silently. He parks himself in front of the TV. I eat, and finish, but I cannot take care of the dirty plate, so it's sitting beside me on the bed.\n\nTen minutes after I eat, I use crutches to hobble to get my own medication, and he ignored me while I struggled to get a glass of ice water and take the meds. It's an obvious struggle and he is choosing to ignore me. I manage to take the meds, and as I walk by him to go to bed, he says nothing. He just now crawled into bed and is near asleep. He hasn't said anything to me yet. No \"how are you?\", no apology, no consideration. Silence.\n\nDoes he owe me an apology? Or AITA?\n\n*Edit for clarification: I'm not sitting around in bed. I'm walking as much as possible, following doctor and PT directions. It's my second hip replacement. First one was in 2018. Early onset osteoarthritis. I can't cook yet though, and he said he would.", "created_utc": 1703076278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mtr4i/aita_for_demanding_apology_from_carerhusband_for/", "score": 4097, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He dropped the ball. Majorly. You were/are unable to count on him during a period of need - a 16 year old kid met your needs better than he did so obviously you don\u2019t have too high of standards. This is some feigned incompetence bs and it\u2019s time he was called out on it. It also sounds like this type of thing isn\u2019t new - I would suggest exploring couples counseling to work through it because I doubt he is going to put in the work on his own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After 10 days, I just gave him a list for the grocery store and made food myself. You didn\u2019t plan anything and are blaming it on him. A hip replacement is much easier than a knee.

He needed to ask better questions and put in more effort.  It seems like all of this is a long time coming and has to do with a LOT more than his caring for you right now.  You should both start reading up on emotional intelligence and non-violent communication.  Once you're healed and mobile again, I highly recommend couples therapy...unless the relationship is too far gone...then maybe a whole other conversation is in order.\n\nI would have worked with my partner to carefully plan as many meals and snacks and drinks as possible.

If you had a specific meal plan in mind, you should've discussed that before the surgery and laid out your expectations.

Men aren\u2019t wired like women are and it\u2019s pretty sad that you are taking your frustrations out on him. You need to say you are sorry to your husband and stop acting so entitled.

It looks like you had that, but OP did not. I am the primary cook in my marriage, because I genuinely enjoy cooking. My husband really doesn\u2019t cook. And before anyone comes at him for being an adult man who doesn\u2019t cook, he was raised by his great-aunt who took him in when she was a never married, childless woman in her 50s, so after 30+ years of Girl Dinners, she was never much of a cook, either. So he was raised on easy dinners. Meanwhile, I learned to cook from watching my parents (especially my dad) making dinner for a family of four. But anyway, my husband can make easy things, and I have been working on showing him more simple recipes, and he has been happy to learn. However, if I were to be incapacitated right now, we\u2019d probably eat a lot more Hamburger Helper, frozen pizza, and breakfast-for-dinner than I would prefer, but he\u2019d at least be trying his damnedest. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the issue with OP\u2019s husband. It doesn\u2019t feel like he was trying very hard, barely even putting in the bare minimum, and when OP got upset because she\u2019s not feeling the care, he decided to be mopey and not even help her with things she needs him to help with.
