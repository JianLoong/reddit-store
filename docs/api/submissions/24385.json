He moved in five months ago. He's currently in college and plays in a band with a few of his college friends. He pays around 25% of the bills, his only income is the band.\n\nI work from home, and I have an office room with a computer at home. Once, my boyfriend asked me if they could practice in my office, because they can't go to their usual place right now. First, I protested saying the room is way too small for all their equipment and instruments, but he said it'll be fine and stuff, so I agreed. Later that day, his friend accidentally pushed down and cracked my monitor, and they refused to pay for it. My boyfriend refuses to pay until this day, because he keeps saying I agreed knowing there could be consequences. \n\nYesterday, he asked if they could practice again, because they have no other place, and an important show is coming on. I told him no, and stayed firm about it. The monitor was quite expensive, and I refuse to have it broken again. We argued until he just decided to leave and I couldn't reach him ever since. A woman who's in the band with them sent me a text blaming me for ruining their practice but that's all I heard from them.", "created_utc": 1691742488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o30go/aita_for_not_letting_my_bfs_band_practice_in_my/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My boyfriend refuses to pay until this day, because he keeps saying I agreed knowing there could be consequences.\"\n\nAnd no longer being able to use the space for practice is the consequence.  Also, he needs to be your ex-boyfriend, you don't need a long term relationship who has that sort of attitude.", "NTA.  Dump the lot of them.", "Haha, \u00abyou agreed knowing there could be consequences\u00bb. Well, now you say no based on the fact that you don\u2019t accept the consequences (= your stuff is broken), and he is offended? This guy is delutional. He can\u2019t have both ways. \n\nOf course you don\u2019t get to destroy other people\u2019s stuff and be invited back. I think they are assholes for even asking. If they apologized for breaking your monitor and replaced it, I would be okay to ask. But you are never the asshole for not wanting to share your space. It is your space. It is your home office. It is yours. If you are uncomfortable having them practice there, that is plenty enough reason to say no. \n\nHonestly, I would reevaluate if I wanted to be in this relationship at all. Breaking other people\u2019s stuff and refusing to pay for it would be a dealbreaker for me. \u00abOnly income is the band\u00bb doesn\u2019t work out for most people either\u2026 If that is his long time plan he will most likely continue to let you carry the load. Right now you are covering his share financially AND are expected to accomodate so his band can practice AND he is an asshole about it. You can do better.", "NTA ... not sure if there's a limitation, but maybe you can still drag that band member or the whole band to small claims court and demand compensation. \n\nUsing a room does not entitle anyone to damage what is in that room. \n\nAlso you should look into a new label for the dude that lives with you. Like *ex-bf* and *former tenant*. Time to give him notice to look for new living arrangements. \n\nDon't waste your time on people who act like him.", "NTA\n\nIf he had apologized and replaced the monitor, I might have disagreed, but that kind of entitlement is not something you want in your home, so let him stay away until he can come back in a decent mood.\n\nAnd that woman just heard his side of the story, not yours, so disregard her.", "Fuck him, crazy the amount of entitlement", "NTA and I would also insist on getting paid for the monitor. It's absolute bullshit to say that you agreed knowing there would be consequences; that is nothing more than a cop-out so he doesn't have to deal with the confrontation with his bandmates. I'm really flirting with the rule 1 line here, but he isn't just acting like the asshole this time; he *is* an asshole. He's disrespectful, entitled, spineless, and values his band more than you. Why couldn't he have told them that they weren't welcome because they broke the monitor? Because he'd rather throw you under the bus than deal with the confrontation. You deserve better. Please re-evaluate this relationship and think about whether this kind of behaviour is a pattern.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Later that day, his friend accidentally pushed down and cracked my monitor, and they refused to pay for it.
