He moved in five months ago. He's currently in college and plays in a band with a few of his college friends. He pays around 25% of the bills, his only income is the band.\n\nI work from home, and I have an office room with a computer at home. Once, my boyfriend asked me if they could practice in my office, because they can't go to their usual place right now. First, I protested saying the room is way too small for all their equipment and instruments, but he said it'll be fine and stuff, so I agreed. Later that day, his friend accidentally pushed down and cracked my monitor, and they refused to pay for it. My boyfriend refuses to pay until this day, because he keeps saying I agreed knowing there could be consequences. \n\nYesterday, he asked if they could practice again, because they have no other place, and an important show is coming on. I told him no, and stayed firm about it. The monitor was quite expensive, and I refuse to have it broken again. We argued until he just decided to leave and I couldn't reach him ever since. A woman who's in the band with them sent me a text blaming me for ruining their practice but that's all I heard from them.", "created_utc": 1691742488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o30go/aita_for_not_letting_my_bfs_band_practice_in_my/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can\u2019t have both ways. \n\nOf course you don\u2019t get to destroy other people\u2019s stuff and be invited back. I think they are assholes for even asking. If they apologized for breaking your monitor and replaced it, I would be okay to ask. But you are never the asshole for not wanting to share your space. It is your space. It is your home office. It is yours. If you are uncomfortable having them practice there, that is plenty enough reason to say no. \n\nHonestly, I would reevaluate if I wanted to be in this relationship at all.

It's absolute bullshit to say that you agreed knowing there would be consequences; that is nothing more than a cop-out so he doesn't have to deal with the confrontation with his bandmates. I'm really flirting with the rule 1 line here, but he isn't just acting like the asshole this time; he *is* an asshole. He's disrespectful, entitled, spineless, and values his band more than you. Why couldn't he have told them that they weren't welcome because they broke the monitor? Because he'd rather throw you under the bus than deal with the confrontation. You deserve better.

BF says they wont pay for the broken monitor because you \"agreed to let them use the room knowing there would be consequences\". Okay. So... reply back to whoever texted you (or all of them really) that after learning what the *consequences* are for letting them use your space, you wont be doing that again. Monitors cost money and these idiots are careless and don't give a damn about protecting the space you graciously allowed them to use. The natural **CONSEQUENCE** to *their own actions* is that they have less places to practice because they cannot be trusted.\n\nActions do, indeed have consequences, he is correct :)", "NTA they still need to pay for the monitor wtf.

Who goes- well, sure you can use this space. I accept that you could totally do damage to it. That's fine.\n\nThey're all over the age of 5. They understand that it isn't their space and they need to take care of it responsibly. That they needed to take care of the space.\n\nI honestly don't have a problem with the fact that your BF's only income is his band. He's in college. He already has a full-time job. I'm not crazy about the fact that it's his only income and he lives with you. So you are supplementing the fact that he's opted to play in a band v. getting a job that covers his bills. \n\nIn all fairness, I'm generally not crazy about this whatever the sex is. (when one partner is covering more of the expenses while the other is following a dream career when you're really young and dating. you aren't at a point in your life where you should be financially supporting your partner. you're not. if something crazy happened fine. but it hasn't. this is his actual plan- you pay more costs so he can focus on his dream.) But specifically when the career focus is something where you have to learn to balance the dream with practicality. Even more so when the person with the dream seems to be very I'm right, you're wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  They broke your monitor & refused to pay.  You knew the consequences.
