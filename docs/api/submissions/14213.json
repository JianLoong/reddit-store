She will find out and it will break trust. If you're lying about something as serious as doing drugs, what else are you hiding? That's going to be her assumption and she will have no reason to trust you're telling the truth. You're going to do serious damage to your relationship for a high. Yta.", "Did he even need to ask?", "YTA no relationship can be great if one have to hide things to the other", "YTA, rarely, couple times a year.. why you lying to us also?", "YTA", "i\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NAH. you\u2019re occasionally using a drug for therapeutic reasons and you\u2019re only not telling your partner because they place judgement on it. it\u2019s not ideal to withhold information from a partner like that, but it sounds like her blanket attitude towards mind altering substances has put you in that position. \n\nhowever. if this is a person you\u2019d like to stay with long term, you should have a conversation about it. they deserve the facts and to be able to decide if this is a dealbreaker for them or not. and you also deserve to enjoy the things you enjoy without feeling like you have to hide or be evasive about it. \n\ni dated someone years ago that didn\u2019t drink/etc and for a while i would just omit details like this, but eventually got tired of feeling like i was hiding. he was fine and non judgmental about it, but when we eventually broke up after a few years, the difference in lifestyle/substance use was definitely one of the factors.", "YTA but not for taking MDMA. Healthy relationships are built on trust and you've taken away her right to make choices for herself about whether this is acceptable for her or not. She might be fine with it, she might not, but you've hidden information from her and denied her autonomy in the decision. \n\nMDMA has the potential to be really great for wellbeing if it's done in the right situation etc and it's being rolled out as a therapeutic drug. If you're using it in that kinda way and it's only a handful of times each year it's unlikely you have a problem with that particular substance. But your partner deserves the opportunity to decide for herself if that's something she's willing to have in her world. She's open to consequences from your choices (legal, dealing with you accidentally OD'ing, etc) and if you're serious about each other, which it seems you are, she's going to be living with illegal drugs in her home without her knowledge. That's not OK. \n\nYou need to come clean. If she finds out and it's not from you proactively bringing it up, this could be a fully irrecoverable situation. Take responsibility and own up. It's the only reasonable course of action from here, and be prepared that you may have already broken her trust past the point of no return. You can only hope that there's enough positive in your relationship that she's willing to understand and allow you the opportunity to rebuild the trust you've already broken", "Oof... Dated a guy for 2 months and when I went up to visit him and stay with him. On the first day he came up to me and was like \" Okay dont freak out, but I do CAT\" and pulled the bag out of his pocket. I was not happy with it and I had no way of getting home so I felt it was a \"deal with it\" situation.\n\nI am a stoner since 2015 and weed is not the same as MDMA, COKE, CAT whatever it may be. You hid for a reason and you know the reason..\n\nYTA.", "YTA (but only slightly)\n\nShe doesn't have the right to tell you what to do with/to your body. She does have the right to set boundaries and from what you said, she doesn't like being *around* people using harder drugs and in this case she *isn't* around so that boundary isn't broken.\n\nHowever, she's probably still gonna get pissed if she finds out just because you lied. I understand why you're lying about it, but she won't see it that way she's just gonna see you lied.", "YTA - I would say NTA because I secretly smoke weed but I feel bad about it and want to tell the truth. Plus can she not tell you\u2019re high on MDMA? It\u2019s hard to conceal when on high.", "YTA\nJust because you\u2019re afraid of her response doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right to hide it from her", "People in here are weird.

This sounds like something that's not actually a problem, seeing as there was no confrontation.", "NTA. You dont have to share everything with your partner. You are stil an individual.

Will your partner only find out once she finds syringes or you've started selling her stuff or are in jail for possession?", "YTA. Instead of finding someone who\u2019s okay with your use, you hide it from them.", "If you have to hide it and you're coming here to find out if YTA (feeling some guilt?), then probably-yeah. She was open and honest with you regarding the drug use, she set those boundaries. Yet, you do it anyway and you aren't honest with your partner about the use of MDMA. It's fairly disrespectful on your part to do what you are doing in that it's selfish behavior. Probably better to come clean to her, than here, and have that difficult conversation. Then figure out a solution.", "YTA, but most importantly please be safe. Those types of drugs are being laced and can be lethal.", "YTA--- If you feel like you have to hide it from her, there's a reason for that. Weed is one thing, but synthetic and lab-made drugs are completely different. Plus, maybe instead of finding happiness with MDMA, you should try to get to the root of the problems with therapy dude. It costs the same as a bunch of drugs.", "YTA for not telling her. But not the ass for doing mdma.", "YTA.

Most people don't know the difference and are taking the synthetic versions.", "The Drug harvested from Sassafras ist MDA, not MDMA.
