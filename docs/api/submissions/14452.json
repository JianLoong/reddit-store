In Norway, everybody is freely allowed on any uncultivated land, including camping, even if it's privately owned. In the UK, there are plenty of rights-of-way which supercede any private ownership of the land, and (at least in in Scotland) there are also similar access rights to land that isn't a private garden or where crops are actively growing, even if it's private.\n\nAgain, this sort of thing almost certainly doesn't apply to OP, given the description of it as a suburban area with a backyard and them probably being in the US, but I just think it's interesting that in some places privately-owned property is still considered publicly accessible in a lot of conditions. On the other hand, in the United States this isn't the case, and I while I can't remember the name I remember a couple of popular hiking mountains being \"de facto\" privatized because they were bordered by private property, even though the mountain itself was on federal land.", "I like the noise idea!
