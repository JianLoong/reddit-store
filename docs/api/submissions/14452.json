We are on a cul-de-sac so to see the views you either need to be in one of our homes or in the shallow backyards. There are no fences (we can\u2019t build one) but it is very obvious that it\u2019s not open for the public. Also, the edge of our backyards drop off very steeply into a rocky decline which is dangerous. We both have screened-in porches that go the entire length of the back side of our homes. They are totally private unless someone is in the backyard so it\u2019s nice to relax outside after a shower.\n\nOur next door neighbors and us are very private people. We don\u2019t want random strangers wandering around our backyards. They have put up two signs along the long driveway, one is a small stop sign below the community-installed sign that says \u201dPrivate Driveway\u201d and the other says \u201cThese premises are under video surveillance 24/7\u201d as we both have Ring doorbells and security cameras. We hoped this would be a deterrent.\n\nPeople still drive or walk up and come on back to look at the view. Sometimes I have been caught in just a towel after a shower or sunbathing. When we ask their answer is always \u201cwe\u2019re just looking at the view\u201d.\n\nYesterday a guy and his kid came up and I was pissed. I asked if he lived here and he said his dad did and then I asked if he had seen the signs along the driveway and he said he was leaving. I said \u201cthe signs are there for a reason\u201c and his kid asked him if they were in trouble and the dad said something like \u201csome people don\u2019t like to share\u201d.\n\nI have told the people I\u2019ve met here that if they ever do want to look at the view to just call me and ask, I have no problem with that, I just want a heads up.\n\nAITA? Also, does anyone have any recommendations for things to do to deter the looky-loos?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD INFORMATION: And I appreciate all of the ideas!\n\n\\-We live in a community where we own our modular home but rent the land. We cannot put up a fence or wall of any kind.\n\n\\-We live in a desert. There is no place to put shrubs and we need that area to get around to the back ourselves. It\u2019s the only way to get large items in and out of the house.\n\n\\-For some reason people think there is a \u201cpublic\u201d sidewalk leading to the \u201cpublic\u201d overlook. There is a sidewalk right against our house leading from our parking pad right to the stairs to our back porch. We don\u2019t have grass but we have gravel as it is desert landscaping. Here is a view from [above](https://imgur.com/i4q6NAv). Our house is on the right. You can see the sidewalk next to the house. You can see our patio faintly beyond that which is where people go look. The space between our houses at the front is pretty close, about 15\u2019, and we share that concrete parking pad (we really don\u2019t know whose property it is on and don\u2019t care, we both use it). There is no way to plant anything to stop people from going back there.\n\n\\-We have no HOA, just a management company who put up a sign that says \u201dPrivate Driveway\u201d. They are okay with us add signs along the driveway.\n\n\\-I love the sprinkler idea but isn\u2019t discriminatory! It isn\u2019t that no one ever comes up here, we have a lovely lady who survived 9/11 and walks up the hill every day if she can carrying the American flag to watch the sun rise. Also we both have invited guests that enter from the back.\n\n\\-Here is a picture of the area. There is a concrete parking pad between our homes for our guests and beyond that our very shallow backyards begin. Once they pull up in that parking area they are right there!
