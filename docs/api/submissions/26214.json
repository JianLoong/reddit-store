We have been married for four years now.\n\nThe issue is my sister is now homeless after losing her job. Our parents have begged us to take her in but Alan said no. I also don\u2019t want her near Alan since she has regretted leaving him and has asked him to take her back or at least cheat on me with her, even though he told her no.\n\nOur parents are really angry at me. They called me a terrible daughter so I told them that my sister is their daughter, not mine, and that I don\u2019t care if she goes homeless.
