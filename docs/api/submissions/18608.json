He\u2019s very inconsiderate. Some coffee machines can be quite loud. Besides, what kind of person put a coffee machine in the bathroom???? Next to the toilet!!!! That is disgusting!!!! Why didn\u2019t he put it in his room?", "NTA your roommate is rude and he is also disgusting for having food/coffee items in the same room with the toilet. Has he never seen the videos with the gross plume that comes out of the toilet when it is flushed?", "NTA - Does he also brew tea in the cistern of the toilet? Steam fish in the shower? WTAF. I know Uni/College has a \"make do\" mentality and is full of quirky weirdness like this (I can just about remember the weird shit I used to do) but still - he's brewing coffee where he shits. Grim as fuck.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd caffeine won't make him better at sniping. It'll keep him awake is all, a better sleep schedule will do the same, if anything caffeine is detrimental as he'll be losing his fine motor control to snap shots as he's X coffee's deep at 3am etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMove out. Then he can brew in the shitter all he wants.", "NTA. Your roommate's decision to set up the coffee machine in the bathroom, especially right next to the toilet, is inconsiderate and disruptive to your sleep schedule. It's important for roommates to establish boundaries and respect each other's needs, including sleep. You've already made a reasonable request for him to stop making coffee in the bathroom during your designated sleeping hours, but he has dismissed your concerns.\r  \n\r  \nIt seems like he prioritizes his gaming performance over your well-being, which is not fair. Instead of shaming him to his girlfriend, it would be more effective to have an open and honest conversation with both of them. Explain how the noise and disturbance affect your ability to get enough rest for work and emphasize the importance of a peaceful living environment. Together, you can discuss finding a compromise that allows him to continue enjoying his espresso machine while considering your need for uninterrupted sleep.\r  \n\r  \nIf your roommate still refuses to cooperate, it might be necessary to involve your landlord or housing authority to mediate the situation and enforce a resolution.", "NTA. Coffee makers aren't supposed to be in a bathroom. Unsanitary, which is why public restaurants dont make food or drinks in the bathroom. That's disgusting dude. Now you wont be able to tell a coffee stain on the toilet or a **** stain. Lol. Living with others requires a 50-50 compromise, within reason. Why cant he move it to his room then? Even more convenient, probably quieter for you, and sanitary. Disgusting is disgusting, plain and simple. Some people need to know as they aren't aware of their behavior. Just be as polite as you can, but firm.", "NTA. I'd be royally pissed myself, pun definitely intended. \n\nWTAF is he thinking, no regards to you, plus he drinks shit coffee, like. Literally.", "NTA.

And the fact that the coffee machine is in the bathroom made me gag. Ugh, it sounds so disgusting!\n\nYou gotta love the fact that he said he needs to be alert because he's the team's sniper. Is he a soldier or something? Why should his video games be more important than your sleep?", "NTA.

Your roommate is being inconsiderate here and needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him. Also, who the hell WANTS their coffee to be made right next to a toilet?!?", "NTA . I am very petty and would just get earplugs but also start making as much noise as possible as I get ready for work.", "Who in their right mind would put a coffee machine next to the toilet? WHY would he want to consume something made in a room designed for grooming and shitting?

A coffee machine in the same room you both shit in?? What the hell is wrong with this man??\n\nPlus his reply when you asked him to relocate the machine is ridiculous. He could as well be using it to stay up all night to furiously masturbate but that wouldn't change the fact that you don't put a coffee maker beside someone's room and run it at 2 freaking am.\n\nMove out if you can, it's clear that your roommate's a moron who doesn't respect your sleep and boundaries.\n\nOf course NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
