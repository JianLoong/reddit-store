Step one is to say \u201csorry, it\u2019s not convenient for you to stay here for a week, here are some hotel options.\u201d Step two is to tell your boyfriend that this situation has gotten TOO bizarre and there is no train for this behaviour and if it continues you want a paternity test run on the kids to prevent Lisa from escalating her obsessive behaviour with any spurious claims.

Unless you were with them since the beginning of the relationship, you\u2019re relying on what you\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m assuming. \n\nThis relationship goes way way beyond friendship. To up-end your whole life to follow a \u201cfriend\u201d constantly, abandoning your partner in another country, is bizarre at best, psychologically abnormal and immoral at worst. \n\nI\u2019d re-examine their relationship more objectively, without taking into account what they\u2019ve been telling you. There\u2019s something more happening here.", "This seems so weird.

He's emotionally cheating _at best_. But I'm pretty sure there's more going on than that. This is not a normal friendship, on any level or depth. If it was, he'd _at least_ feel overwhelmed by her. And he'd be worried you might misinterpret her behaviour, which would jeopardize his relationship with you. But he's not worried at all. His priorities are set. \n\nYou need to get out of this relationship, as I don't see any good outcome of this.

If they are in a part of the world where him being gay is not viable for his physical safety, this early life marriage makes this idea plausible.  To me this would explain, the ease at which she can move around the literal world on a whim without him and him not giving two figs about it.\n\nI too feel as if at least one of her children if not both are OP's BF's kids.\n\nAt this point out of morbid curiosity, I would be tempted to do covert DNA testing on both kids to get a definitive answer.  To me it would be warranted as OP's BF hasn't once thought that his friend following him around the world isn't bizarre.\n\nAt this juncture, I wonder if OP is BF's beard disguising his true relationship with his BFF.", "There\u2019s definitely more going. I feel like the kiddo is your husbands and her husband is just an acting extra. NTA but girl you need to have a sit down with your husband.

Expecially how she doesn't follow her actual husband. You may not want to hear it but there is definitely something wrong here, are you sure the child isn't your husbands?

It\u2019s stalker level. \n\nI\u2019m betting on second family.", "NTA That is your boyfriend's girlfriend and children.", "NTA - So, do you get along with your sister wife?  Seriously, this seems weird as heck to me.", "NTA. If they're not already cheating they will soon", "You already know this is weird as fuck\u2026something needs to change and/or you need to get to the bottom of it or this is just going to be your life forever", "It\u2019s natural for Lisa to want to move with her affair partner and his child.\n\nNTA", "Yes, and certainly not multiple times", "But bf seems to like it. It's not stalking if the stalked person actually _wants_ you to be around. The issue is the bf.", "\"Having a kid with them\" is the really really suspicious part to me. I think OP is blind. I think Lisa's kid is her bf's, which is why she moves around to follow him. Lisa's husband knows.", "Maury sense tingles", "That's where I am at.  Reading her description of the events was pure insanity.  Like you're in an open relationship and you're the only one that doesn't know it is open.  Her boyfriend must be one smooth mother fucker with all the right words.  ESH", "Yikes", "She's said in a comment that she has indeed met the  husband. He's real.", "Is that what your husband told you??? Because people lie\u2026\n\nAnd your post are leaving important information related to timing. Because from what you wrote, it seem the friend got pregnant while she wasn\u2019t living in the same country as her husband\u2026\n\nIf her baby is really her husband, then why isn\u2019t she moving country with him??? Why does the husband accept to be separated from his kid??? OP that fact alone is super weird and suspicious as F. \n\nFollowing your husband everywhere he go in the world instead of her husband\u2026 why is that husband still married to her???\n\nNTA OP, but really look back at your life with your boyfriend and try to be really objective\u2026. Something is wrong here", "And yet, he doesn't seem to discourage any of her behaviors. Behaviors that definitely go way beyond just a friendship. Honestly it goes beyond even a sibling like relationship between friends. This is the ax that a wife or girlfriend does to follow their partner. \nWhile he may not have actively encouraged this behavior or actively gotten into a relationship with her, he's not doing anything to discourage what she's doing. He's not doing anything to call out the inappropriate behaviors. He allows her to come and stay whenever she wants, regardless of how you feel. It's looking like your relationship with him is always going to come second to his relationship with her.", "With all due respect it\u2019s impossible for you to ACTUALLY be sure just because he said so.", "It certainly doesn\u2019t sound like a situation where you can be afforded that certainty.", "Seems like your bf isn\u2019t saying too much either. Which is super weird.", "DNA test her babies", "Does he not notice she basically follows his work location and ask why?", "if this was a woman it would be stalking. why are you acting like the boyfriend likes it? absolutely nothing implies that.", "Its not really stalking when you happily let them live with you a week and stay good friends with them.  More of a second family...", "That's definitely not your business or problem to deal with. This would be the hill for me, this is nuts. She felt entitled to just show up and think she could stay for a week with her kids? With no notice? After following your bf around the world for years? I'd love to know what he has been saying to her for her to think any of that would be appropriate.", "Perhaps she messed up her relationship with her husband by, idk, cheating on him?", " BUt does your boyfriend know her behaviour with him is weird or does he think it's normal and fine? Because if it's the second, this will be all your life!!", "How long have you guys been together at this point?", "i mean, i've seen platonic codependent relationships happen, even among opposite sex/gender compatible pairs, but this seems super fishy. did lisa grow up in a stable home? \n\ni'm a straight male and have mostly women friends, and jealousy was always an immediate deal breaker for me. but this seems fishy as heck.", "This! My old boss had a fake boyfriend. She even had his photo in her office. This is because she was sleeping with one of her direct reports.\nI used to call the boyfriend George Glass behind her back.\n\nOne of the most dishonest people I\u2019ve ever met. Her LinkedIn is pure BS. She even made a fake LInkedIn account for my colleague she was sleeping with so she could write a fake recommendation for herself from him.", "I think if you're getting to the point where you feel the need to DNA test someone else's children, it's probably time to take a step back and wonder if never seeing any of these people again might be the saner option.", "Would you willingly invite your stalker into your home to stay with you for a week? In fact from Ops post, she stays with them regularly, surely if the boyfriend didn\u2019t like it then he would have said no, got a restraining order, filed complaints to the police, tell Op to stay away from her and not converse? No he has done nothing. His lack of action is telling. He clearly likes the attention. Op needs to sit boyfriend down and ask him wtf is going on.", "Completely agree. The fact OP's boyfriend doesn't see Lisa's behavior as a red flag is in and of itself a red flag. It's not normal to transfer countries to follow your friend around. I can't believe the boyfriend is too clueless to notice the pattern here, my guess is it's a huge ego boost for him. A true friend would be concerned Lisa is uprooting like this and urge her to pour that energy into her family/marriage.\n\nI also suspect the boyfriend is romantically involved with Lisa however much he denies it. OP needs to stop listening to what he tells her and start paying attention to his actions or lack thereof. In this case the lack of action he's taken to change this dynamic speaks volumes.", "It\u2019s not 100%, more like 99", "Lol good ol Reddit trying to sneak the word gaslight into any conversation", "99.999999", "I wish more people were familiar with [abductive reasoning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) since it really is the primary form of inference people use.", "It's been the word of the month, lmao.
