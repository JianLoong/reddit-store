At this point you need to put your foot down about the way she interacts with him. Step one is to say \u201csorry, it\u2019s not convenient for you to stay here for a week, here are some hotel options.\u201d Step two is to tell your boyfriend that this situation has gotten TOO bizarre and there is no room for this behaviour and if it continues you want a paternity test run on the kids to prevent Lisa from escalating her obsessive behaviour with any spurious claims.

Unless you were with them since the beginning of the relationship, you\u2019re relying on what you\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m assuming. \n\nThis relationship goes way way beyond friendship. To up-end your whole life to follow a \u201cfriend\u201d constantly, abandoning your partner in another country, is bizarre at best, psychologically abnormal and immoral at worst. \n\nI\u2019d re-examine their relationship more objectively, without taking into account what they\u2019ve been telling you. There\u2019s something more happening here.", "This seems so weird. Are you sure you met her real husband and not a fake husband ?", "You need to speak with your boyfriend and draw up some boundaries.

He's emotionally cheating _at best_. But I'm pretty sure there's more going on than that. This is not a normal friendship, on any level or depth. If it was, he'd _at least_ feel overwhelmed by her. And he'd be worried you might misinterpret her behaviour, which would jeopardize his relationship with you. But he's not worried at all. His priorities are set. \n\nYou need to get out of this relationship, as I don't see any good outcome of this. But since you're not able to see or process this note because you've been gaslit for so long, I suggest you start some digging.

How does he react when she shows up unannounced at his place to stay for days?", "Wow I find this very hard to believe that you really can't see what is going on here.  What happens if you refuse to let her stay at the apartment?  Do you even have a say in that?  NTA for thinking it is acceptable behavior but you have much bigger issues to tackle.", "NTA. You said in a comment that you\u2019ve never met Lisa\u2019s husband, that just seems very strange. And she follows your husband around the world!? Aaand your husband doesn\u2019t mind?

I\u2019m never one to draw conclusions like this but\u2026 it seems very plausible.", "Honestly I can see why a lot of people conclude that your bf is the baby daddy.

Something feels very wrong here.", "NTA - but something weird is going on here.\n\nWhat part of the world are you from?\n\nI'm wondering if your BF's friend married her husband as a beard for him.  If they are in a part of the world where him being gay is not viable for his physical safety, this early life marriage makes this idea plausible.  To me this would explain, the ease at which she can move around the literal world on a whim without him and him not giving two figs about it.\n\nI too feel as if at least one of her children if not both are OP's BF's kids.\n\nAt this point out of morbid curiosity, I would be tempted to do covert DNA testing on both kids to get a definitive answer.  To me it would be warranted as OP's BF hasn't once thought that his friend following him around the world isn't bizarre.\n\nAt this juncture, I wonder if OP is BF's beard disguising his true relationship with his BFF.", "There\u2019s definitely more going. I feel like the kiddo is your husbands and her husband is just an acting extra. NTA but girl you need to have a sit down with your husband.

None of these are good things.", "NTA - Lisa on the other hand kind of is one, mostly to her kids.

It don't matter that he doesn't have feelings for her, it is obvious Lisa has some kinda of obsession with him and you have every right to be annoyed with her. And your husband should make it stop. I mean, he should have told her long ago \"look, I don't feel comfortable with you calling me instead of your husband in emergencies, I'd like for you to stop, also I am not comfortable with you showing up unannounced and deciding to go every where with me.\". He should have cut her off a long time ago.

Because something doesn't add up here.", "Kind of odd that she would drop everything and take herself and I'm assuming her child and go follow another man in a new country? That's just odd. Expecially how she doesn't follow her actual husband. You may not want to hear it but there is definitely something wrong here, are you sure the child isn't your husbands? The fact that your husband is allowing this is even more strange. I'd consider ending the relationship because somewhere, someone is lying.
