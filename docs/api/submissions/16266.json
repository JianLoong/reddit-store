He needs to set hard boundaries with her and ensure she respects you.\n\nBut even if he doesn't have romantic feelings towards her, he might enjoy her slavish devotion and feel some (misguided) loyalty to her because of their long history.he may be resistant to changing their dynamic.\n\nYou can tell him that you will only tolerate Lisa and her impact on your lives for so long. If he continues to enable her obsession, you will leave them to enjoy each other's company. He is letting her walk all over you.

Then talk to Lisa with boyfriend about this rule.

He's got yours. That's how strong relationships work.\n\nShe's a long-time friend who is clearly obsessed and has ruined her marriage with the hope of turning to your partner. There is no other explanation for her behaviour and disrespect to your relationship. He needs to make it clear that he is not interested.\n\nI'm not suggesting he is lying to you at all. Sometimes, people can be blind when it comes to a friends behaviour. He may not have feelings beyond friendship for her, but he should not be her go-to for help. She needs to stand on her own feet and be a responsible mother to her kids. \n\nHe can still be her friend, but she needs to know that's all it is.", "NTA this situation is so weird", "Your boyfriend is showing some serious red flags here, you may want to reconsider your relationship with him.

That's creepy and that lady seems to avoid her husband at any cost , I am 100% sure that it's not his kid , can't blame your husband as you claim that he would never go for her but it's just soo weird and there's no other possible explanation to this .", "NTA.

Yeah, that's super weird then.", "NTA\n\nBut you have to understand that you knowingly got into a relationship with someone that has a \"friend\" that follows them around the world.

Please don\u2019t reply that it\u2019s because he told you so, and you trust him. Their behavior is beyond that. \n\nYes, it\u2019s THEIR behavior. Obviously, she\u2019s in love with your boyfriend. However, I think that you need to face the fact that he encourages it. When she left her husband in order to follow him to another country, he should\u2019ve ended their friendship. He should\u2019ve gone to their company\u2019s HR department to let them know that he was uncomfortable with her actions. Did he? \n\nAt best, he\u2019s naive and ignoring her obsessive actions. At worst, he\u2019s the father of her children, and their affair has been ongoing. \n\nI\u2019m concerned that you are even questioning if this \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d actions are acceptable. Of course they aren\u2019t! Who\u2019s even making you question that? Isn\u2019t your boyfriend creeped out be her obsession with him? \n\nAt this point, you\u2019re NTA. However, that could change if you refuse to face this very inappropriate situation head on."]}
