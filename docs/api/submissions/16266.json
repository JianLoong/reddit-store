That's creepy and that lady seems to avoid her husband at any cost , I am 100% sure that it's not his kid , can't blame your husband as you claim that he would never go for her but it's just soo weird and there's no other possible explanation to this .", "NTA.

Yeah, that's super weird then.", "NTA\n\nBut you have to understand that you knowingly got into a relationship with someone that has a \"friend\" that follows them around the world.

Please don\u2019t reply that it\u2019s because he told you so, and you trust him. Their behavior is beyond that. \n\nYes, it\u2019s THEIR behavior. Obviously, she\u2019s in love with your boyfriend. However, I think that you need to face the fact that he encourages it. When she left her husband in order to follow him to another country, he should\u2019ve ended their friendship. He should\u2019ve gone to their company\u2019s HR department to let them know that he was uncomfortable with her actions. Did he? \n\nAt best, he\u2019s naive and ignoring her obsessive actions. At worst, he\u2019s the father of her children, and their affair has been ongoing. \n\nI\u2019m concerned that you are even questioning if this \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d actions are acceptable. Of course they aren\u2019t! Who\u2019s even making you question that? Isn\u2019t your boyfriend creeped out by her obsession with him? \n\nAt this point, you\u2019re NTA.

He either needs to set up boundaries with her/or maybe cutting her out of his life or else he will be seeing you leaving because of her", "lmao I don't even know where to start with this. ESH for allowing this to go on as long as it has  and it sounds like you are being willfully obtuse. Why does your boyfriend allow her to follow him from country to country?

Why are you allowing her to stay for a week unannounced?\n\nRidiculous all around.", "Your boyfriend is her baby daddy", "NTA but... OP. \n\n1) You've never met this husband.

You gotta run. Your bf is allowing this to happen. The friend keeps knowing about your bf moving because your bf tells her. Your bf, by now, knows that she will follow him. Yet, he does nothing to stop it.", "NTA, and further more, I suggest you get away from both of them as soon as possible. Like yesterday. Take it from a guy who is lucky as hell he is alive after my partner of 23 years tried to murder me and stole every single thing I had in this world, leaving me homeless with brain damage to die on the streets. \n\nIf you are saying is correct, then this Lisa is totally unhinged and has no boundaries. My ex didn't even act like this. \n\nDo. Not. Make. The. Mistake. Of. Thinkig. It. Won't. Happen. To. You.

You can say \u201cthey\u2019ve never had a romantic relationship\u201d all you want in the comments but if that\u2019s the line your boyfriend is giving you it\u2019s probably because while it is true in his eyes that there was no \u201cromantic relationship\u201d it sounds like they absolutely had a sexual relationship. At this point you need to put your foot down about the way she interacts with him. Step one is to say \u201csorry, it\u2019s not convenient for you to stay here for a week, here are some hotel options.\u201d Step two is to tell your boyfriend that this situation has gotten TOO bizarre and there is no train for this behaviour and if it continues you want a paternity test run on the kids to prevent Lisa from escalating her obsessive behaviour with any spurious claims. Explain to him that this has gone on for so long and become so fucked up that not dealing with it is a dealbreaker for you. You need to get to the root of what is going on because it is not healthy.", "NTA- That is very strange.", "NTA. You have a boyfriend problem though. He should be stopping this. The fact he doesn't is concerning.", "NTA - I personally don't accept the girl bestfriend thing. I think it's weird how she relies so heavily on your boyfriend and not her husband.

Two of my best friends moved out of state. I didn't follow them because.......that's insane. She should have her own life with her own family and friends. Dropping everything over and over for one person.....that's not normal.", "> I am sure that my boyfriend never had any romantic relation with her.\n\nHow can you be sure, though? Unless you were with them since the beginning of the relationship, you\u2019re relying on what you\u2019ve been told, I\u2019m assuming. \n\nThis relationship goes way way beyond friendship. To up-end your whole life to follow a \u201cfriend\u201d constantly, abandoning your partner in another country, is bizarre at best, psychologically abnormal and immoral at worst. \n\nI\u2019d re-examine their relationship more objectively, without taking into account what they\u2019ve been telling you. There\u2019s something more happening here.", "This seems so weird. Are you sure you met her real husband and not a fake husband ?", "You need to speak with your boyfriend and draw up some boundaries. What has he said about it all?", "There is 100% more to that relationship.  I think you are just too close to the situation and they have gaslighted you into believing otherwise.  I hope you can get some answers.", "THIS. At some point OP's spidey senses should have tingled, and not just about the friend. Why is your BF so invested in this behavior? What's the benefit for him with this 'friendship'? I really hope OP isn't ignoring very obvious red flags because she doesn't want to 'lose' the guy..."]}
