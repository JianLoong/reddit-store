We are close even if I've always been the weird and different one (moving away etc). Hubs comes from a huge, more middle class fam. One of my favorite things to do is host & entertain. I think life can be hard & making people comfortable or showing them a great time is a really worthwhile thing. It's also fun for me, like a giant crafting project, to plan an event. I love it. \n\nMy husband does very well and I have been lucky to have a great career and do the same. Our wedding was the only time likely for all these people we both loved to be in the same place, to meet & celebrate together, so we wanted to make it special and magical. We were very clear that gifts were not necessary, and I set aside a fund for my aunt and I to coordinate covering any expenses for people who wanted to come but couldn't afford the hotel, an outfit, etc. but quietly. \n\nI know a huge wedding is a waste to many people but it isn't to us. We did 3 days of events and covered meals and open bars for 300 ppl. We had a short Cirque-type performance, a big welcome party with a kind of carnival for kids, gift bags for everyone, and lots of surprises. It was so fun to watch all the joy & everyone smiling & happy. Everything was optional, we shamed no one who came to only one part or couldn't swing it.\n\nAt brunch the final day my aunt pulled me aside & asked me to go to my cousin's room & console her. She said she had been sobbing all night/morning because her wedding (in Aug) would be nowhere near this level & she thought all our family would hate it and judge her. My heart broke! Every wedding I've been to with my family has been low key, maybe in a barn or rec center, someone's backyard. No one has ever judged or looked down on this (nor would I- Just different styles) and we always have a great time!\n\nI left my guests at brunch and spent the better part of an hour with my cousin trying to assure her of all the above. I told her a wedding is a celebration of love, not money etc, and that we were all very excited. She finally got weirdly calm and stopped crying, then just looked me dead in the eyes and said something like, \"Well you don't need to worry about it because you're not invited anymore.\" Then locked herself in the bathroom. \n\nI came back to brunch and most everyone was gone. I was crying but didn't want to make a scene and just got out as fast as possible. My husband keeps telling me not to take it to heart, but I hate that something we worked so hard to make fun and memorable for people ended up making someone I love feel terrible! And now my aunt (her mom) has started telling people I just did this to \"rub my family's face in my great, fancy, rich life\" etc. I feel sick. I was so happy and proud and now I feel so stupid.

At first I sort of brushed this off but I showed my husband and he thinks you may be right. A few things make me think this...\n\nShe and her parents were definitely the people who most asked for money to attend. We paid for their hotel room and I bought her dress and shoes, which I didn't mind at all since I know lots of my fam doesn't have fancy stuff and also she's planning a wedding- expensive! They also venmo requested me the first day on their way in for $100 gas money which no one else did, but again, gas is expensive, it's fine... But, basically, I don't think they had to spend a dime for the weekend.\n\nAnd now that I think about it when we shopped for her outfit over the holidays she did a lot of \"ohhhh I wish we could pay for this thing but it's just not in the budget\" and I thought she was just talking wedding planning so we talked about creative solutions etc (bc again- my whole perspective is that you can absolutely do a wedding on a budget! I don't think there is anything wrong with it- I saved money where I could, too!) I offered to let her use some supplies I had like frames, decor, stuff for ring bearer/flower girl, etc. She didn't want any of it.\n\nAnd the saddest part is, if she had just called and asked, I would have given her money as a wedding gift to help pay.

YES. That's it. If you know me, you know. That really just clicked for me because I think the most hurtful part was that someone I love could think I would hurt them intentionally or not know me at all. At the end of the day, I don't know why I'm so focused on these two people when soooooo many other people were over the top happy, excited, and thankful. Every other social media post was glowing and excited to show off their outfits and experience and say how much fun they had. Why do we fixate on the negative? \n\nBeing human is crazy lol. Thank you for your comment. Truly appreciate it.", "Yeah, I don't think she's an AH and she's normally very sweet, so she must have been feeling some things. My aunt... is sometimes quite dramatic. She married in and has always been one to stir the pot, I guess. I should probably ignore her but it hurts to see people from my hometown commenting about how rude I am etc. Oh well.", "Haha that's how I always feel when I've been to really nice weddings- just excited to be there! I know ours might seem over the top to people but I have some friends with serious money and some of the stuff they've done was like... a whole different world. But I've always just focused on having a great time and enjoying the experience, even when I was starting out and dirt poor, because, on top of celebrating friends' love- FREE FOOD YAY! Lol I never felt like oh how dare they feed me and invite me to this awesome party what AHs.", "Oh I never claimed it was. I thought it would be nice to give everyone a little magic and some great memories, and wanted to have fun doing it! If you could have seen the kids' faces especially... I think it was worth it. :) I hope!", "I can see why you would say that, reading it over, but I was legitimately shocked because my family is never like this. My career is in kind of a long shot type of field and they have always encouraged me to follow my dreams and been very proud of my accomplishments. We are all very supportive usually. \n\nFor instance, at the reception the night before a different aunt pulled me aside and told me what an incredible job I did planning it all and how proud she was of the person I'd become bc I would rather spend my money on togetherness and celebrating family than material things, fancy cars, etc. Like a \"I think we raised you right!\" very sweet talk. I'm not saying that to brag but to point out the usual energy around these things. We are all very \"family first\" and accept each other with all our weird quirks and failings and differences. \n\nOf course I can understand how my cousin must feel though, that's why I've felt bad since last weekend. When my aunt started posting this stuff on social media though, I really started spinning and questioning myself, I guess. Thanks for your input.", "Agreed. I don\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t rubbing this display of wealth in the faces of her poor family members. \n\nESH", "\"how dare you use your money on a celebration for something big in your life\" what a joke", "NTA what is the difference in op putting all three days together then someone doing engagement party one night, rehearsal dinner one night, and wedding one day. It\u2019s still a three day event. The only difference was guest made one big weekend instead of having to travel 3 different day.", "Hope you are never invited to an Indian wedding", "Or they put time, effort and money into a 3 day party that everyone could enjoy. NTA OP", "Oh, that's so sad. I'm really sorry you've had to deal with that. Money can cause so much ugliness. Thanks for the warning- it will be interesting to see if anything changes after the wedding, but I'm hoping not. I was very lucky to get some of my biggest successes about 8-10 years ago and, while my family doesn't know the numbers, they know how things are. I've quietly helped here and there but come from pretty proud stock. \n\nI actually sometimes have the opposite issue- I get frustrated when they won't ask lol! Like after my first big break I added my 2 younger siblings to one of my credit cards and begged them to use it if they needed gas, groceries, found themselves in a bad situation etc. (I know that feeling where just a full tank of gas or a few days of food would change everything!) and they would do ANYTHING before they would use it. I kept telling them what is the point of having money if I can't help the people I love most?! Haha ohhhh family.\n\nBut honestly, I might be seeing the cracks start to form. Fingers crossed... I think I have pretty good boundaries but we might be about to find out.", "Oh honey, I hope I\u2019m wrong but its not looking good. It\u2019s the way she immediately calmed down and stopped crying that felt off to me. After all, why keep up the act if it\u2019s getting you nowhere?\n\nFor the record, my whole wedding cost \u00a3200 (rolled gold rings, street clothes, \"reception\" at a local pub etc etc) because we were very poor at the time. I have been to other weddings ranging from budget to extravagant since then and not once have I had even a twinge of jealousy. Different people have different circumstances, it\u2019s that simple. If you try to downplay your fortune (which you achieved through hard work no less!) to make people comfortable you\u2019ll wind up living in a cardboard box, wearing rags.\n\nI apologise if that\u2019s a bit disjointed, it\u2019s 4:30 am and my adhd meds wore off hours ago.

My own wedding (elopement) cost $35 (licence and justice of the peace) plus dinner for us and our witnesses. They were all fun or interesting in different ways, and not in a million years would it occur to me to compare them to each other. Because they were all different occasions!

NTA, but your family have some strange jealousy issues!\n\nFirstly, congratulations on your wedding. Secondly, you should never be embarrassed about how you choose to celebrate your occasions. You\u2019re not responsible for anyone else\u2019s situation apart from your own. You should stand tall and be proud of yourself", "NTA.  I think cousin and aunty decided they wanted to try to take something from you out of jealousy, so they took your presence from your party.  Aunty made sure you had to go all the way to cousin's room, cousin made sure to keep you there for most of the party, and then got eerily calm once that was accomplished.  Even though she'd been \"sobbing all night\".  This is not your problem, it's theirs.  They're jealous, they can't deal, and they're lashing out at you - publicly, no less, *to keep attention away from you now that they've got it.* Go Low Contact and move on with your life.", "NTA. But come on, let's be real. A 3 day event for 300 small town people, and you claim you weren't trying to show off?", "NTA\n\nYou had the wedding you and your now husband wanted. You weren't sitting there like a preschool child saying \"hahaha my wedding is way nicer than yours will ever be\" to your cousin or cousins family.\n\nThe odd calm behavior before uninviting you seems strange. Almost like she just wanted to bring down your joy from the wonderful celebration you had. Don't give this behavior any more thought. She sounds very petty and status concerned which isn't pretty behavior ever.\n\nCongratulations to you and your husband. Enjoy the memories and don't spare a second thought towards the nonsense your family is spouting.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on your new life together!\n\nDon't let those envious relatives anywhere near your baby/ies...", "is that from the princess diaries. source: i watched the princess diaries (1) recently\n\nETA: nvm someone said its elenaor roosetervelt or whatever. sorry", ">because painting you as selfish and nasty is a great way of covering up what they were trying to do.\n\nEither that or they're hoping OP will fork out the money to prove she isn't selfish. I think your comment is spot on. NTA.", "This was my exact thought as well. OP is NTA, but her cousin and aunt absolutely are.", "Anyone else think aunt and cousin were in cahoots to pressure OP into donating a fund to the cousin\u2019s wedding? Aunt - the woman in charge of OP\u2019s charity at her own wedding - insists on a bride leaving a wedding event to console her daughter, who flips on a dime the moment OP\u2019s consoling came without the opening of a cheque book? Same aunt who has probably been dishing out thousands of dollars says OP is rubbing her wealth in their faces.. by sharing it.. just not enough to pay for her daughter\u2019s wedding?\n\nMake it make sense without the natural conclusion being what I outlined above.", "She said her husband's family is middle-class, not that they were. She specifies that she and her husband have become pretty wealthy.", "Your  dream wedding sounded so lovely, congratulations! Your aunt should never have dared approach you asking you to ***comfort*** your cousin, what? I mean... I can't even... If the day was too much to bear they should have just gone home, ridiculous people!\n\nThe only ones at fault here are the envious cousin and her mother, the amount of sheer malevolence that accompanied her revoking your invitation to her wedding makes me think she's been resenting your happiness for some time now. You and your husband would probably have given her a wonderful wedding present too... her loss lol", "You shouldn't make yourself small to make others feel big", "I think I would enjoy a wedding with a cirque du soleil like performance, just as equally as I would enjoy a quiet private wedding in the barnyard. It's because we're there to celebrate our loved ones' union and it doesn't matter what sort of celebration it is.\n\nMy sister's marriage was just a registry with the government department and then we all went out to a nice vegetarian (she's vegetarian) restaurant with close friends and family. It doesn't make us feel any less because there wasn't a huge wedding.\n\nYour cousin's insecurity shouldn't put a damper to your mood. It is a problem that she will need to overcome.", "My grandma once said buy experiences, not things. You are well off and instead of having a celebration of lavish worship of you and your fiance you shared everything with your family, even making sure they could all come. You did a beautiful nice thing, don't let your cousin make you feel bad about it.", "damn i thought it was from the princess diaries \ud83d\ude14", "It is in the Princess Diaries. The driver says it to Mia, who replies that it's a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt.", "If you are not invited to her wedding, don't give her any wedding gift. You can be sure that she's counting on you being kind enough to still send her one.", "Maybe they already didn't like you?", "Please go NC with this aunt and cousin unless they make some real growth as people", "OP you are an angel. We had a family member do this after our wedding AND baby shower. Some people just can't be happy for anyone. I agree with the comments it seems like they were trying to get money from you. You are precious! I know it's hard to focus on that one person upset vs 1000000 different people who are excited and appreciative of you. Believe me I STILL struggle with it. Just try your best. You did NOTHING wrong.", "Oh you are DEFINTELY onto something. Who pulls the BRIDE aside at the couple's post-wedding brunch to direct her to go console someone about their finances? I mean... isn't that the aunt's job? Maybe the aunt should leave the mimosas and go check on her adult child throwing a tantrum rather than have the bride do it? I'm with you on this: it was a move designed to make the bride feel awful about having better circumstances at the very end so that they could hurt her right before her honeymoon and slink away.\n\nOP, if you read this, you sound amazing and your cousin and her mother sound like jealous harpies who didn't want you to have happiness. ETA: NTA.", "Oh that\u2019s interesting. Cousin wails that her wedding won\u2019t be as grand as yours. Aunt drags you in to hear this. Instead of offering to pay for a huge wedding, you tell her small ones are wonderful too. *Then* she gets cold and says you\u2019re not invited. Yes, very interesting.", "I was wondering if they were angling for a nice wedding contribution from OP so that cousin could plan a fancier wedding. While OP is feeling all emotional herself (and thus easier to hustle).", "I never even thought about that but you make a very good point. They may well be hoping that she offers to subsidise the other wedding to \"make cousin feel better.\"", "Oh, aunt and cousin were absolutely trying to get OP and her husband to pay for cousin to have a bigger, fancier wedding.", "Yes, it's not like OP didn't invite people who couldn't drive over! She paid to make sure her fam could attend! All they had to do was show up, have a great time and celebrate a great 3 days with OP! \n\nBut nah, someone had to be all butthurt!\n\nOP I think your cousin did you a favour! Now you know who to cut off from your life and who to keep", "Partial comment stolen from u/ktempest\n\nu/hallintrepid4376 is a bot", "It is in the Princess Diaries. The driver says it to Mia, who replies that it's a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt.", "Comment stolen from u/Witty_Comfortable777\n\nu/trafikkacijskz is a bot", "My whole wedding, the whole damn thing, cost less than \u00a31k and that was my made to measure dress (8months pregnant at the time!), rings, his suit, food, toasting wine, buffet food, all of it. This was 2006. We\u2019re still together and I don\u2019t regret a damn thing. My best friend got married and god knows how much it all cost but her dress alone was 3x my entire wedding lol and it never even crossed my mind to _compare_. Little sis also had a big fancy wedding (cake was 4 whole cheeses stacked!) and again, didn\u2019t compare and didn\u2019t cry coz who cares about how someone else gets married?", "Wow, same!", "Which, she will, when she remembers she can use the wedding gift as an opportunity to get something expensive.", "Maybe the whole scene the cousin was creating was to get a gift of money from OP to make her cousin\u2019s wedding just as nice. \n\nI\u2019m thinking that the cousin thought she could get away with this since OP apparently sent them gas money to get there and paid for clothes too. Some people see someone with just a little mote than them and assume it\u2019s a bottomless well of money that the richer person is obligated to give away whenever asked", "I didn't see that coming. SMH", "The sobbing part's not that weird actually. I agree with the other pieces of evidence, but when people are really upset, especially when they feel like they're in conflict or the situation is unresolvable, emotions can be volatile and it's common for people to change demeanors quite suddenly.\n\nI'd suggest the sister might even be genuinely, honestly upset and still be in the wrong/after money. It sounds to me she might have been holding onto this for a long time, so it's possible she's got this whole victim narrative in her head and sincerely believes she's been wronged."]}
