We are close even if I've always been the weird and different one (moving away etc). Hubs comes from a huge, more middle class fam. One of my favorite things to do is host & entertain. I think life can be hard & making people comfortable or showing them a great time is a really worthwhile thing. It's also fun for me, like a giant crafting project, to plan an event. I love it. \n\nMy husband does very well and I have been lucky to have a great career and do the same. Our wedding was the only time likely for all these people we both loved to be in the same place, to meet & celebrate together, so we wanted to make it special and magical. We were very clear that gifts were not necessary, and I set aside a fund for my aunt and I to coordinate covering any expenses for people who wanted to come but couldn't afford the hotel, an outfit, etc. but quietly. \n\nI know a huge wedding is a waste to many people but it isn't to us. We did 3 days of events and covered meals and open bars for 300 ppl. We had a short Cirque-type performance, a big welcome party with a kind of carnival for kids, gift bags for everyone, and lots of surprises. It was so fun to watch all the joy & everyone smiling & happy. Everything was optional, we shamed no one who came to only one part or couldn't swing it.\n\nAt brunch the final day my aunt pulled me aside & asked me to go to my cousin's room & console her. She said she had been sobbing all night/morning because her wedding (in Aug) would be nowhere near this level & she thought all our family would hate it and judge her. My heart broke! Every wedding I've been to with my family has been low key, maybe in a barn or rec center, someone's backyard. No one has ever judged or looked down on this (nor would I- Just different styles) and we always have a great time!\n\nI left my guests at brunch and spent the better part of an hour with my cousin trying to assure her of all the above. I told her a wedding is a celebration of love, not money etc, and that we were all very excited. She finally got weirdly calm and stopped crying, then just looked me dead in the eyes and said something like, \"Well you don't need to worry about it because you're not invited anymore.\" Then locked herself in the bathroom. \n\nI came back to brunch and most everyone was gone. I was crying but didn't want to make a scene and just got out as fast as possible. My husband keeps telling me not to take it to heart, but I hate that something we worked so hard to make fun and memorable for people ended up making someone I love feel terrible! And now my aunt (her mom) has started telling people I just did this to \"rub my family's face in my great, fancy, rich life\" etc. I feel sick. I was so happy and proud and now I feel so stupid. Did I really F this up that badly?

At first I sort of brushed this off but I showed my husband and he thinks you may be right. A few things make me think this...\n\nShe and her parents were definitely the people who most asked for money to attend. We paid for their hotel room and I bought her dress and shoes, which I didn't mind at all since I know lots of my fam doesn't have fancy stuff and also she's planning a wedding- expensive! They also venmo requested me the first day on their way in for $100 gas money which no one else did, but again, gas is expensive, it's fine... But, basically, I don't think they had to spend a dime for the weekend.\n\nAnd now that I think about it when we shopped for her outfit over the holidays she did a lot of \"ohhhh I wish we could pay for this thing but it's just not in the budget\" and I thought she was just talking wedding planning so we talked about creative solutions etc (bc again- my whole perspective is that you can absolutely do a wedding on a budget! I don't think there is anything wrong with it- I saved money where I could, too!) I offered to let her use some supplies I had like frames, decor, stuff for ring bearer/flower girl, etc. She didn't want any of it.\n\nAnd the saddest part is, if she had just called and asked, I would have given her money as a wedding gift to help pay.

YES. That's it. If you know me, you know. That really just clicked for me because I think the most hurtful part was that someone I love could think I would hurt them intentionally or not know me at all. At the end of the day, I don't know why I'm so focused on these two people when soooooo many other people were over the top happy, excited, and thankful. Every other social media post was glowing and excited to show off their outfits and experience and say how much fun they had. Why do we fixate on the negative? \n\nBeing human is crazy lol. Thank you for your comment. Truly appreciate it.", "Yeah, I don't think she's an AH and she's normally very sweet, so she must have been feeling some things. My aunt... is sometimes quite dramatic. She married in and has always been one to stir the pot, I guess. I should probably ignore her but it hurts to see people from my hometown commenting about how rude I am etc. Oh well.", "Haha that's how I always feel when I've been to really nice weddings- just excited to be there! I know ours might seem over the top to people but I have some friends with serious money and some of the stuff they've done was like... a whole different world. But I've always just focused on having a great time and enjoying the experience, even when I was starting out and dirt poor, because, on top of celebrating friends' love- FREE FOOD YAY! Lol I never felt like oh how dare they feed me and invite me to this awesome party what AHs.", "Oh I never claimed it was. I thought it would be nice to give everyone a little magic and some great memories, and wanted to have fun doing it! If you could have seen the kids' faces especially... I think it was worth it. :) I hope!", "I can see why you would say that, reading it over, but I was legitimately shocked because my family is never like this. My career is in kind of a long shot type of field and they have always encouraged me to follow my dreams and been very proud of my accomplishments. We are all very supportive usually. \n\nFor instance, at the reception the night before a different aunt pulled me aside and told me what an incredible job I did planning it all and how proud she was of the person I'd become bc I would rather spend my money on togetherness and celebrating family than material things, fancy cars, etc. Like a \"I think we raised you right!\" very sweet talk. I'm not saying that to brag but to point out the usual energy around these things. We are all very \"family first\" and accept each other with all our weird quirks and failings and differences. \n\nOf course I can understand how my cousin must feel though, that's why I've felt bad since last weekend. When my aunt started posting this stuff on social media though, I really started spinning and questioning myself, I guess. Thanks for your input.", "Agreed. I don\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t rubbing this display of wealth in the faces of her poor family members. \n\nESH", "\"how dare you use your money on a celebration for something big in your life\" what a joke", "NTA what is the difference in op putting all three days together then someone doing engagement party one night, rehearsal dinner one night, and wedding one day. It\u2019s still a three day event. The only difference was guest made one big weekend instead of having to travel 3 different day.", "Hope you are never invited to an Indian wedding", "Or they put time, effort and money into a 3 day party that everyone could enjoy. NTA OP", "Oh, that's so sad. I'm really sorry you've had to deal with that. Money can cause so much ugliness. Thanks for the warning- it will be interesting to see if anything changes after the wedding, but I'm hoping not. I was very lucky to get some of my biggest successes about 8-10 years ago and, while my family doesn't know the numbers, they know how things are. I've quietly helped here and there but come from pretty proud stock. \n\nI actually sometimes have the opposite issue- I get frustrated when they won't ask lol! Like after my first big break I added my 2 younger siblings to one of my credit cards and begged them to use it if they needed gas, groceries, found themselves in a bad situation etc. (I know that feeling where just a full tank of gas or a few days of food would change everything!) and they would do ANYTHING before they would use it. I kept telling them what is the point of having money if I can't help the people I love most?! Haha ohhhh family.\n\nBut honestly, I might be seeing the cracks start to form. Fingers crossed... I think I have pretty good boundaries but we might be about to find out.", "Oh honey, I hope I\u2019m wrong but its not looking good. It\u2019s the way she immediately calmed down and stopped crying that felt off to me. After all, why keep up the act if it\u2019s getting you nowhere?\n\nFor the record, my whole wedding cost \u00a3200 (rolled gold rings, street clothes, \"reception\" at a local pub etc etc) because we were very poor at the time. I have been to other weddings ranging from budget to extravagant since then and not once have I had even a twinge of jealousy. Different people have different circumstances, it\u2019s that simple. If you try to downplay your fortune (which you achieved through hard work no less!) to make people comfortable you\u2019ll wind up living in a cardboard box, wearing rags.\n\nI apologise if that\u2019s a bit disjointed, it\u2019s 4:30 am and my adhd meds wore off hours ago.

My own wedding (elopement) cost $35 (licence and justice of the peace) plus dinner for us and our witnesses. They were all fun or interesting in different ways, and not in a million years would it occur to me to compare them to each other. Because they were all different occasions!

A 3 day celebration with performers, gifts for 300 guests and a fund for having lodgings etc...

And we still managed to stay on budget.\n\nInstead of purchasing the vases for the flower arrangements - we needed 6 or something- we bought a set of tall beer glasses. We trifted MOH dress and made some decorations ourselves. Went for a small bouquet that had common flowers. Not to mention the wedding was in the winter, which made venue cheaper as it's not the popular season to marry where I live.\n\nSome people - mom - tried to make me feel bad for it. \"Rubbing my happiness\" and all that. I know that feeling. Shame even when you did nothing wrong.\n\nPeople gonna hate, and people gonna be pissed. It's because of them, not you.\nI'm sorry that your family acted that way.

Period. \n\nYour cousin is unreasonable and your aunt is ungrateful. After you paid for them to attend your wedding they treat you this way? Ew. They both sound horrible.", "NTA.

A little story to explain why I say that: \n\nSeveral years ago, one of my cousins got married to a really great woman. She's from a rural area and her parents are old school hippies without much money. (His side of my family is squarely middle class.) They had a simple but pretty wedding; her parents made a lot of the decor and favors themselves. My cousin's mom and her sister (my aunts) got sloppy drunk, cornered me in the bathroom, and started blubbering about how my future wedding would of course be so much more sophisticated and I HAD to promise them they'd be invited. Never mind that I have no particular plans to ever get married.\n\nVery likely, either your in-laws would have been disappointed with a modest wedding (like my aunts) or your own family would be getting after you about how you have the means to live it up and show everyone a good time on your dime, how dare you deprive them, it's condescending, etc. I'm glad you did what *you* wanted to do. You and your husband are the only ones you can be sure to please, and that's the right priority.", "it's terrible when people take a gesture meant to be positive for many people and turn it into a negative.", "Read up on the Gini coefficient.

But from the perspective of some of your family members you've shown them how poor they are. It's a tricky situation to handle.", "> FYI, it is an Eleanor Roosevelt quote and is actually, \u201cNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\u201d\n\nAnd perfectly indicates why \"shaming\" is nonsense.
