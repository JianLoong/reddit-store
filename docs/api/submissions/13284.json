We are close even if I've always been the weird and different one (moving away etc). Hubs comes from a huge, more middle class fam. One of my favorite things to do is host & entertain. I think life can be hard & making people comfortable or showing them a great time is a really worthwhile thing. It's also fun for me, like a giant crafting project, to plan an event. I love it. \n\nMy husband does very well and I have been lucky to have a great career and do the same. Our wedding was the only time likely for all these people we both loved to be in the same place, to meet & celebrate together, so we wanted to make it special and magical. We were very clear that gifts were not necessary, and I set aside a fund for my aunt and I to coordinate covering any expenses for people who wanted to come but couldn't afford the hotel, an outfit, etc. but quietly. \n\nI know a huge wedding is a waste to many people but it isn't to us. We did 3 days of events and covered meals and open bars for 300 ppl. We had a short Cirque-type performance, a big welcome party with a kind of carnival for kids, gift bags for everyone, and lots of surprises. It was so fun to watch all the joy & everyone smiling & happy. Everything was optional, we shamed no one who came to only one part or couldn't swing it.\n\nAt brunch the final day my aunt pulled me aside & asked me to go to my cousin's room & console her. She said she had been sobbing all night/morning because her wedding (in Aug) would be nowhere near this level & she thought all our family would hate it and judge her. My heart broke! Every wedding I've been to with my family has been low key, maybe in a barn or rec center, someone's backyard. No one has ever judged or looked down on this (nor would I- Just different styles) and we always have a great time!\n\nI left my guests at brunch and spent the better part of an hour with my cousin trying to assure her of all the above. I told her a wedding is a celebration of love, not money etc, and that we were all very excited. She finally got weirdly calm and stopped crying, then just looked me dead in the eyes and said something like, \"Well you don't need to worry about it because you're not invited anymore.\" Then locked herself in the bathroom. \n\nI came back to brunch and most everyone was gone. I was crying but didn't want to make a scene and just got out as fast as possible. My husband keeps telling me not to take it to heart, but I hate that something we worked so hard to make fun and memorable for people ended up making someone I love feel terrible! And now my aunt (her mom) has started telling people I just did this to \"rub my family's face in my great, fancy, rich life\" etc. I feel sick. I was so happy and proud and now I feel so stupid.

At first I sort of brushed this off but I showed my husband and he thinks you may be right. A few things make me think this...\n\nShe and her parents were definitely the people who most asked for money to attend. We paid for their hotel room and I bought her dress and shoes, which I didn't mind at all since I know lots of my fam doesn't have fancy stuff and also she's planning a wedding- expensive! They also venmo requested me the first day on their way in for $100 gas money which no one else did, but again, gas is expensive, it's fine... But, basically, I don't think they had to spend a dime for the weekend.\n\nAnd now that I think about it when we shopped for her outfit over the holidays she did a lot of \"ohhhh I wish we could pay for this thing but it's just not in the budget\" and I thought she was just talking wedding planning so we talked about creative solutions etc (bc again- my whole perspective is that you can absolutely do a wedding on a budget! I don't think there is anything wrong with it- I saved money where I could, too!) I offered to let her use some supplies I had like frames, decor, stuff for ring bearer/flower girl, etc. She didn't want any of it.\n\nAnd the saddest part is, if she had just called and asked, I would have given her money as a wedding gift to help pay. Within reason- I have a lot of cousins lol! But if she just asked, I would have. \n\nI don't think I would now..... I hope you're wrong about it all being kind of a big weird plan, but ick.

YES. That's it. If you know me, you know. That really just clicked for me because I think the most hurtful part was that someone I love could think I would hurt them intentionally or not know me at all. At the end of the day, I don't know why I'm so focused on these two people when soooooo many other people were over the top happy, excited, and thankful. Every other social media post was glowing and excited to show off their outfits and experience and say how much fun they had. Why do we fixate on the negative? \n\nBeing human is crazy lol. Thank you for your comment. Truly appreciate it.", "Yeah, I don't think she's an AH and she's normally very sweet, so she must have been feeling some things. My aunt... is sometimes quite dramatic. She married in and has always been one to stir the pot, I guess. I should probably ignore her but it hurts to see people from my hometown commenting about how rude I am etc. Oh well.", "Haha that's how I always feel when I've been to really nice weddings- just excited to be there! I know ours might seem over the top to people but I have some friends with serious money and some of the stuff they've done was like... a whole different world. But I've always just focused on having a great time and enjoying the experience, even when I was starting out and dirt poor, because, on top of celebrating friends' love- FREE FOOD YAY! Lol I never felt like oh how dare they feed me and invite me to this awesome party what AHs.", "Oh I never claimed it was. I thought it would be nice to give everyone a little magic and some great memories, and wanted to have fun doing it! If you could have seen the kids' faces especially... I think it was worth it. :) I hope!", "I can see why you would say that, reading it over, but I was legitimately shocked because my family is never like this. My career is in kind of a long shot type of field and they have always encouraged me to follow my dreams and been very proud of my accomplishments. We are all very supportive usually. \n\nFor instance, at the reception the night before a different aunt pulled me aside and told me what an incredible job I did planning it all and how proud she was of the person I'd become bc I would rather spend my money on togetherness and celebrating family than material things, fancy cars, etc. Like a \"I think we raised you right!\" very sweet talk. I'm not saying that to brag but to point out the usual energy around these things. We are all very \"family first\" and accept each other with all our weird quirks and failings and differences. \n\nOf course I can understand how my cousin must feel though, that's why I've felt bad since last weekend. When my aunt started posting this stuff on social media though, I really started spinning and questioning myself, I guess. Thanks for your input.", "Agreed. I don\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t rubbing this display of wealth in the faces of her poor family members. \n\nESH", "\"how dare you use your money on a celebration for something big in your life\" what a joke", "NTA what is the difference in op putting all three days together then someone doing engagement party one night, rehearsal dinner one night, and wedding one day. It\u2019s still a three day event. The only difference was guest made one big weekend instead of having to travel 3 different day.", "Hope you are never invited to an Indian wedding", "Or they put time, effort and money into a 3 day party that everyone could enjoy. NTA OP", "Oh, that's so sad. I'm really sorry you've had to deal with that. Money can cause so much ugliness. Thanks for the warning- it will be interesting to see if anything changes after the wedding, but I'm hoping not. I was very lucky to get some of my biggest successes about 8-10 years ago and, while my family doesn't know the numbers, they know how things are. I've quietly helped here and there but come from pretty proud stock. \n\nI actually sometimes have the opposite issue- I get frustrated when they won't ask lol! Like after my first big break I added my 2 younger siblings to one of my credit cards and begged them to use it if they needed gas, groceries, found themselves in a bad situation etc. (I know that feeling where just a full tank of gas or a few days of food would change everything!) and they would do ANYTHING before they would use it. I kept telling them what is the point of having money if I can't help the people I love most?! Haha ohhhh family.\n\nBut honestly, I might be seeing the cracks start to form. Fingers crossed... I think I have pretty good boundaries but we might be about to find out.", "Oh honey, I hope I\u2019m wrong but its not looking good. It\u2019s the way she immediately calmed down and stopped crying that felt off to me. After all, why keep up the act if it\u2019s getting you nowhere?\n\nFor the record, my whole wedding cost \u00a3200 (rolled gold rings, street clothes, \"reception\" at a local pub etc etc) because we were very poor at the time. I have been to other weddings ranging from budget to extravagant since then and not once have I had even a twinge of jealousy. Different people have different circumstances, it\u2019s that simple. If you try to downplay your fortune (which you achieved through hard work no less!) to make people comfortable you\u2019ll wind up living in a cardboard box, wearing rags.\n\nI apologise if that\u2019s a bit disjointed, it\u2019s 4:30 am and my adhd meds wore off hours ago.

Definitely some weird plan.Regardless, you are NTA and your relatives need to grow up.", "I've been to weddings that involved, respectively, a sit-down meal for 1,000 at the Ritz in Doha, 3 days worth of ceilidhs in the Outer Hebrides, a river cruise and a sit-down dinner for 150 in a medieval monastery, and pot luck reception for 25 or 50 people (I made the cakes for both those). My own wedding (elopement) cost $35 (licence and justice of the peace) plus dinner for us and our witnesses. They were all fun or interesting in different ways, and not in a million years would it occur to me to compare them to each other. Because they were all different occasions!

Attempting emotional blackmail at OP's wedding is horrible.", "This.

They are actually pretty small people if they begrudge you happiness and success.", "NTA - Your family members\u2019 jealousy is not your problem. Since you\u2019re no longer invited to your cousin\u2019s wedding you now have a free weekend in August to go do something fun with your husband!", "NTA, but in all honesty, I would be sus about your aunt. She's the one that pulled you aside to go console your cousin, which was sweet of you to do, but why did no one even message or come to see if everything was ok? Did aunt say something to the guests that caused them to leave? Why did no one tell you they were leaving?", "NTA.  This is a her issue, not a you issue.  You made your wedding into a family party.  Everyone can\u2019t afford to or may have no desire to and that is okay too.  Wrote it off as there always has to be one troublemaker and let it go.  If you want a nice jab, if you had some family photos taken at your wedding, you can always her one framed as her wedding present.", "Best wishes on your marriage, and splendid as your wedding sounds, I hope the years to come are even finer. \n\nYou don\u2019t need this woman. You tried to comfort her, and she turned on you. If you had scaled down, she probably would have shown off. \n\nYou have a husband who loves you, the support of family and friends, talent and security. You don\u2019t need this woman. Cry and then move on.", "NTA, your cousin was just hella jealous and wanted to make you feel bad because she just couldn\u2019t control her jealousy.", "NTA. You and your husband sound lovely and generous. Sounds like a great wedding! In your cousin\u2019s case, it would appear that the apple did not fall far from the tree.", "Eleanor Roosevelt", "Hey OP, congratulations on your wedding! \n\nI think you and I have some things in common. I grew up really poor, and my personality has always been, like you describe, 1) loving to host people and make celebrations special, 2) always trying to do creative problem-solving and help whenever someone tells me about an issue they\u2019re having, and 3) golddigging relatives. \n\nIt took me a while to realize 1 and 2 weren\u2019t just the normal way everyone thinks and acts. And it took me a really long time to realize 3. It finally clicked when I got my first post-grad school job in NYC, and my older sister called and was talking about how she wanted to come to NYC for her engagement, but it\u2019s so expensive, etc. I immediately went into problem solving mode. I could go to visit friends and she and her fianc\u00e9 could stay in my new apartment to save money\u2014just like you and trying to help your cousin with her wedding planning on a budget. My sister, instead of appreciating my immediate impulse to share everything I had and help her with her trip, ultimately just got mad that I wasn\u2019t getting the hint: I was supposed to offer to fly her to NYC and book her into a fancy hotel, so she could brag to her church friends in TX about the glitz and the glam. (Note, I had never even booked a fancy hotel for myself\u2014I had only stayed in hostels and hadn\u2019t even gotten my first paycheck.)\n\nI literally never realized there are people like this: people who only care how much something costs, and who are just trying to get money and high-status brands and experiences out of others. It took me years to wrap my mind around this fact. \n\nI think this cousin and aunt/uncle are like my sister. They are not approaching their relationship with you with the same open-handed sharing and love and honesty that you give them. They saw that you would just give and give money for them to come to your wedding, and so you have become a mark for them, someone who should pay for everything they want. You\u2019re going to have to accept the asymmetry of this set of relationships and stop trying to have mutual understanding or make them happy.", "Sure was! Both parties were late-40s professionals who decided to throw a bash for friends from around the world, in one of the wine regions in Germany...we were living in Europe at the time and able to drive there (used to Canadian distances, eh). Came home with several cases of wine and monastery-made beer in the trunk of our car. Bonus!!\n\nBut if I had to do it over again, I'd still go for the $35 elopement - because no one can hassle you when they don't know it's happening!"]}
