{"id": 7974, "submission_id": "10ijnjo", "title": "AITA for letting my daughter and her husband move in with me so they won\u2019t be homeless?", "selftext": "This situation is complicated and I\u2019m at my wits end. I have 2 daughters who are civil to each other but don\u2019t get along with each other. My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met.\n\nSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies. \n\nAdam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early.\n\nSteve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society.\n\nNeither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well. \n\nI retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this.\n\nSteve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nI know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason.\n\nEdit\n\nI couldn\u2019t add many details in my original post because I was afraid of going over the character limits. \n\nAdam pays the taxes and utilities on this house but because it\u2019s the only house he has in this state, he keeps its financials separate from the rest of his properties. Also, he doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the house. Instead, he gave it over to my youngest to take care of so she handles all of the bills and maintenance and pays them out of an account he set up. She noticed the increased utility cost which is when she called. \n\nWe just spoke again and I laid my soul bare to her. I knew I was going back on our agreement but it was to keep her sister from being homeless. We had a lengthy conversation and in the end, she agreed not to tell Adam. She\u2019ll cover the increased utility cost out of her own pocket so he won\u2019t notice it. In exchange, her sister and Steve will have 3 months then will have to move out. I originally told them they had 6 months. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have such a compassionate daughter. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Some of the comments were very hurtful but some were helpful. You made me realize I should have called my youngest at the start and asked. That would have saved alot of tears.", "created_utc": 1674394025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ijnjo/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_and_her_husband_move/", "score": 2025, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You went back on an agreement that you made. Why didn't you call your youngest and tell her the situation instead of going behind their back?", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but Adam is doing you a favour by gletting you live in this house and he gave you one rule so he\u2019s not taken advantage of and not only did you break this rule but you did so by allowing the person who insults Adam to live there.\nYour daughter and her husband want to live by the values they have fair enough but they need to be able to have money to back that up. If by Steve losing his part time job they are in this much trouble then they didn\u2019t have the money to spend freely and go travelling to begin with.\nYeah you have two daughters but at the end of the day the person who owns this house has no obligation to house your adult daughter and her husband and honestly you so if you loose your home because of this then you only have yourself to blame.", "YTA, I'd say your were going for the better to all for forgiveness than permission type, but you didn't even plan on telling Adam. Given how you describe Steve, I'm betting they won't be out by X date.\n\nETA: I have a feeling Adam set that condition because he saw this coming.\n\nEdit: Based on OPs edit how many people think Steve and sister will be out in 3 months? I predict we see youngest post in 3 months. \"AITA for not telling my husband that my sister and BIL moved in with my mom\" because hiding big things like this from your future husband totally never turns out bad, right?", "YTA. \n\nYou're not renting. You're not paying any bills.\n\nYou had rules and you broke them.\n\nAdam is willing to pay for you, but not for anyone else.", "YTA\n\nI get the concern, but you dont get to be generous to your daughter and Steve on Adam's dime.   If you really wanted to do this, you should have asked Adam if he would agree to a short term exception, not gone behind his back.\n\nAlso, Steve needs to step up and help support his family.   Only working part-time so the family can spend more time together and travel is not a luxury he can afford.  He and your eldest daughter are also AHs for trying to do so on Adam's dime.  Especially after calling Adam a corporate shill and everything that's wrong with America blah blah blah.", "Awww Op I can understand you wanting to help your eldest daughter but you did the 1 thing you weren't supposed to do. YTA. I'm betting Adam figured this would happen eventually and that was why he made that 1 rule. \n\nSteve is irresponsible.. if he only worked part-time then I'm failing to see why he hasn't found another job already to keep him and his wife from becoming homeless.", "YTA Your SIL is paying all your utilities and only charges $1, he done something incredibly generous for you.  You take advantage of him by secretly having him also provide for your daughter and her loser husband, he should kick all three of you out. Of course he was going to find out about them living there, there is a big difference in paying utilities for one person vs three people. Why should your daughter and her husband support your other daughter and husband? He should kick all three of you out for taking advantage of him.", "You had an agreement and he went above and beyond building a house you don\u2019t have to pay for.\n\nYTA, hope he starts charging you 2 grand a month and puts utilities in your name so the bum SIL has to get a job and pay some bills.", "YTA. You had ONE job. \n\nAdam's right, Steve is a slacker, and now he's reaping the consequences of that.\n\nWhere are you, Steve, and your oldest daughter going to live when Adam kicks you out for breaching your agreement with him?", "YTA Steve sounds like a piece of work - he blames Adam for everything wrong in the world and calls him a corporate shill,yet has no issue leeching off of him. They're about to be homeless and he still won't work, he and your daughter are willing to jeopardize your living situation so they can continue the lifestyle they can't afford. You should have refused and made Steve work ( gasp!)full time. I don't blame your other daughter for being angry and now you've put her in a really difficult spot, you've lied and you want your daughter to lie to her husband? I can't believe this is how you repay your son in law's generosity- I have a feeling that rule was put in place specifically for those two freeloaders.", "Gentle YTA. Adam did something really nice for you and you\u2019ve basically spat in his face. You are also jeopardizing your own housing situation. Please call your daughter and Adam and apologize immediately. You also are going to have to tell your other daughter and Steve to leave. Steve does not have the luxury to work part-time if he doesn\u2019t have a place to live. You are enabling him at the risk of hurting yourself. Doesn\u2019t make very much sense.", "YTA. Everyone else covered a lot\u2026 But I\u2019m going to add that you need to call your daughter and apologize for asking her to keep a secret from Adam. That you would ask her this is just absolutely disgusting to me. Adam has every right to know that you don\u2019t respect him. And that\u2019s what this is, you don\u2019t respect the man that has gone above and beyond for you. Steve has spent a lot of energy on belittling and behaving like an ass towards Adam. And now you all expect Adam to bail him out? No. That\u2019s not how this works. Call your daughter, apologize and agree to tell Adam yourself. Frankly I understand why your daughter doesn\u2019t like her sister and her sisters hypocritical, lazy and quite frankly entitled husband.", "YTA\u2014 sorry OP, but you are a massive asshole. This guy built a house for you and asks you to pay $1 rent with the only condition that you don\u2019t allow others to live there. I don\u2019t know anyone living in such generous and giving conditions.\n\nSo yeah, you massively breached the trust of the giving hand. I understand your concern for your less successful daughter and her husband \u2014who works part time, so I guess your more successful son in law was right about him being a slacker, but the very least you could have done was to ask for permission.\n\nYou just burned the relationship and trust of the person who was allowing you to live so comfortably. Really dumb.", "He had one rule for you ONE and you broke it. Now you are gunna be homeless as well as your daughter. \n\nSteve is a free loader he needs to get another job and a full time job at that. So he can support HIS family not live off your daughter and your good will. \n\nThe further you bury your head the worst it's gunna get. Wake up and smell the roses or in this case the manure they are growing in. \n\nYTA", "Ok YTA. You are not helping them and steve and your oldest are lazy. You are encouraging bad behavior. Steve should work full time and so should your oldest. When someone loves their partner they don\u2019t let them go homeless, they try to make more money not to become homeless.He doesn\u2019t \u201ctreasure\u201d family time, he is irresponsible. Pls look at the red flags and stop helping them, or they will never grow up. How do you as a mother even think that steve is good for your kid?", "YTA, you are being supported financially by your daughter and her husband, that\u2019s what free rent is. You cannot then subsidise someone else. You should have asked, and respected adam and your daughters answer. If you really feel bad, tighten your belt for a while, give up your luxuries and give them money. Even that\u2019s a push with fairness if you\u2019re living rent free off someone else. \n\nI understand you don\u2019t want to see them homeless, but their attitude to money and security is what got them in the situation, not just losing a job", "Obvious YTA. Someone built you a house, and this is how you're returning that favor?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me.\" Expect your generous rental agreement to stop soon. Start looking for a new home, you will likely be evicted soon. YOU are the AH here. You broke their trust and lied to them. YOu broke the rental agreement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you can move in with Steve, wherever they will be living.", "You had one job. To not let anyone live in the house. Funny how Steve didn\u2019t like how Adam run his business but at the end, he\u2019s the one who end up on the verge of homelessness. With the stunt you pull, better pray Adam doesn\u2019t make you join them. YTA", "YTA. Clearly, Steve has a problem. He may love your daughter, but if he is only working part time, and that lost income is such a huge problem, then they couldn't afford their lifestyle to begin with. Steve should be out there flipping burgers or waiting tables. Places are hiring. It won't be the job he wants. But, it's something.", "YTA. You have no idea how good you have it. A luxury home and only $1 a month? And all you had to do was follow one simple rule. You understand that rule most likely was put in place because Adam knew your daughter and Steve would pull this stunt. Why should he pay for three extra people? Don\u2019t be surprised if he starts charging you actual rent, as he should.\n\nSo Steve only worked part-time because he treasures family time? As if everyone else who works full-time does not?  He had no business working part time and spending without a safety net. Playtime is over, Steve. It\u2019s time for him to be s big boy and get a full time job, and it\u2019s time for everyone around him to stop enabling him.", "ESH - Steve\u2019s a slacker and got his family into this. Adam is rigid and inflexible. You went behind Adam\u2019s back knowing there would be fallout. You should have called Adam immediately to lay out the situation. You didn\u2019t because you were afraid of his reaction, which is now worse than what it would have been. Time for a family meeting. I believe there is a reasonable solution.", "Such a bad decision. \n\nPlus, you hid it from them.\n\nAt best, maybe Adam will demand rent while Steve stays there.\n\nSteve needs to understand risk of becoming homeless is a consequence of his lifestyle.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Steve clearly isn't responsible if they're traveling but don't have enough savings to hold them over in case of emergency. Adam had 1 rule and you broke it. You need to tell Steve and your daughter to get into a shelter asap as you don't end up homeless along with them.", "YTA \n\nYou knew the rules, there wasn\u2019t any ambiguity in your housing arrangement.", "Unfortunately you allowed your need to accommodate your daughter and Steve to jeopardize your living situation.\nI understand as a parent, however, your child is a victim of her and her husband's lifestyle. Sounds like you're all going to be out on the street. YTA to yourself for putting your living situation in jeopardy.", "YTA. \n\nWith all due respect for caring for your daughter and for being Adam's mother in law - that house is not your property to do with as you please. You don't get to decide who can live there and for how little or long.\n\nAdam worked hard and sacrificed much to be able to set you up so comfortably, and you repayed him by using his sacrifice to spare Steve from the consequences of his own lackadaisical lifestyle.\n\nI'd be furious if I was him.", "You're effectively living for free and you think it's ok to change the terms. YTA whether it's for a good cause or not", "YTA - if Adam owns the house & pays all utilities why would you EVER think it\u2019s okay to move more people in without approval? This is a huge problem because while Steve & his wife are struggling, you\u2019ve sent them the message it\u2019s OK to do what you\u2019ve done. It was as simple as explaining to your daughter that you have restrictions to your living arrangement & you will try to help in another direction.", "YTA.\n\nAlso frankly, the hypocrisy of Steve is astounding - he shits on Adam because he, y'know, actually works for a living and then he's more than happy to take advantage and mooch off the money Adam earns.\n\nAnd you're enabling that.", "Sorry, but you don't own the house.\n\nYTA", "YTA, you had very simple rules to follow in exchange for a really sweet deal on your rent.  You didn\u2019t ask for an exception because you knew the answer ( or thought you did, people can surprise us).  You intentionally broke the rule, you broke your younger daughter and fianc\u00e9 trust.  Hope it was worth it.", "YTA. And, your daughter and her raggedy husband are all AH. He hates people like his BIL\u2026.until he needs something from his BIL. You obviously didn\u2019t plan for your future and now depend on your SIL. I hope their marriage stays strong cause the man has to work all the time to support a family of users and losers.", "Very gently because I know I know you mean well, but YTA\n\nAdam could see that Steve and your other daughter would be really irresponsible and need help after some time. He and his spouse didn\u2019t want to be the ones supporting the other pair. And now you\u2019re doing just that.\n\nYou could have at the very least asked them but you chose not to", "Yta and if I was then I would kick you out", "YTA.  You tried to sneak 2 people into a place provided for you.  You could have at least talked to them.", "**YTA**, Adam is doing you a huge favor and you\u2019re intentionally disregarding his very clear request in turn. You\u2019re being an asshole for accepting his charity then stepping all over his boundaries.\n\nYou\u2019re also being quite foolish in doing so. Do you have a backup plan for living arrangements? You\u2019re doing your best to create a situation where you\u2019ll need it..", "Adam isn\u2019t even your son in law yet and still built you a house to live in.  That was exceedingly generous. And yet you still betrayed his one stipulation.  And you broke that agreement but somehow think your eldest daughter and her husband will keep theirs???  It\u2019s likely they will never move out. YTA. And you live rent free in a house customized for you even!!! but seem to have zero money saved to help your eldest daughter?   I think you are not being honest and just want to ride out on Adams money without parting with any of yours.", "YTA. Adam probably made that rule because he knew Mr \"Live for the moment\" would show up at your doorstep at some point wanting to mooch off him. \n\nSure, you can't take it with you, but it's irresponsible to not save anything for emergencies or retirement.", "YTA which is ironic because I\u2019d probably take Steve\u2019s side on the \u201cAdams the cause of society\u2019s woes\u201d debate, but from the sound of things Steve has been a shortsighted jackass. \n\n\u201cSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter\u201d that\u2019s nice. How about working FULL time because he treasures your daughter and wants to make sure that if he were to lose his job for a period of time he has some options other than moving into a house with his MIL that he\u2019s not allowed in?\n\nIt seems really clear that the reason the policy was that the house built was for you and you alone is because Steve was anticipating this exact scenario.\n\nWanna help Adam? Take some of the money that you\u2019re saving and help them find a spot elsewhere and make him get fully employed so they\u2019re back on their feet. Then apologize to Steve and your Eldest for going back on your promise and try to make it up to them.", "YTA.", "YTA \nSteve is a juvenile knob. \nAdam sounds amazing.", "YTA. I hope you get evicted", "YTA lets be honest Steve is super short sighted and you bailing him and your daughter out is just enabling his frankly dumb views. Adam should by all means throw you all out of his house, maybe your younger daughter can convince him not to. But honestly why should she strain her relationship with Adam to help:\n\n\\-a sister she already does not get along with\n\n\\-the sisters husband that has insulted her fiance before\n\n\\-her mother who lied to her and betrayed her trust\n\nNone of you deserve their mercy at this point and for your sake I hope they are more generous then I would be.", "YTA, I'm pretty sure when you're homeless Steve will not let you move in with them.", "YTA. They are going to be homeless because of their poor decision making. Your are simply enabling their bad decisions. \n\nAdam was right and Steve and your daughter\u2019s life philosophy got then into the mess they are in. He has no reason to support two people who don\u2019t want to work and purposely make bad financial decisions.", "See what happened is you have fucked around and not about to find out. Steve is a bum who doesn't want to get a job period. You are enabling them and Adam is 100% correct on Steve. They are homeless because of their own actions and from what you described of Steve he will try to live with you indefinitely and you'll lose everything so good luck to you\n\nYTA", "YTA and the way you describe your two son IL\u2019s is weird.  You talk about Steve like he is a gem but his beliefs led to being homeless and somehow you don\u2019t find nothing wrong with that? Adam was right to call him lazy and expecting handouts cause that is exactly what he did.", "Soft YTA. Adam wants to take care of you because you\u2019re a sweet person, but he put those stipulations in place because he didn\u2019t want your sweetness to get taken advantage of. Too, enabling Steve and your other daughter into not taking full responsibility for their lives will only hurt them in the long run.", "**YTA** \n\nYou are getting a wonderful deal from Adam that he worked hard for. \n\nSteve can get a full time job and stop sponging off his MIL and BIL.", "What you *should have done* is talk to Adam and get his permission. I think he would have gladly allowed it, because then he\u2019d be able to hold it over Steve\u2019s head for life.\n\nYou broke the terms of your gift lease. YTA", "YTA. Now you get to all be homeless together. Great planning.", "YTA - hate to say this but you\u2019re a conniving abuser of your family\u2019s trust.", "YTA twice\n\nOnce because you broke the agreement\nTwice because what\u2019s going to be different when the time limit passes and they don\u2019t have a place. Will it be ok for them to be homeless then but not now or will you break the agreement.\nThrice because of Steve thinks Adams is what is wrong in this world, he shouldn\u2019t be using Adam\u2019s extended charity to get by.\n\nHopefully you don\u2019t all end up homeless though that is what you are working towards", "YTA- Adam built you a customized home and charged you almost nothing in rent and all you had to do is not let anyone else live there, but you decided to do the literal only thing you were asked not to do. And here\u2019s a tip for Steve and your oldest- live within their means. It\u2019s great that Steve prioritizes family but if he doesn\u2019t want to work full time than they need to live within the money that they have. Does it suck? Yea. But that\u2019s life", "YTA-for lying. You should have discussed the situation with Adam and your daughter. They might have negotiated with you, or not. \n\nThis space was not yours to give.", "YTA. Steve has no problem taking advantage of the corporate shills generosity does he?\n\nAs you broke the one rule he gave you, now you have a good chance of being homeless. For cutting out loud, he even pays your utilities!!!!\n\nI would be furious if I was taken advantage of in this way.\n\nWhat you should have done was asked permission, not gone behind their backs. You have betrayed them.", "Ah, how quickly Steve's values went out the window when he needed something from Adam. YTA. Adam has been extremely kind & generous to you with the only stipulation as your landlord of no roommates. My 1st thought he probably envisaged this very situation. He's now paying to house 3 adults who aren't yet related to him. I understand its a horrible position to be in, but you weren't actually in a position to say yes to them & have put yourself in a very precarious position with your own housing. You've put your daughter in a horrible position by asking her not to tell Adam.", "NTA. Adam sounds like a huge AH. It seems the rule was made specifically so that your other daughter and Steve couldn\u2019t stay there. I think the most telling thing will be how he reacts when he finds out. If he threatens to kick you out, definitely he\u2019s TA. This deal was never to help you, I suspect. It was to look like the good guy and exert control more than anything. Kind, helpful people do not place unreasonable conditions on their help.\n\nOriginal comment removed\u2026edited to fix the only thing I can imagine was the problem. If not, it was nice knowing the sub, I guess.", "YTA", "YTA.  You made a commitment to someone who spoiled you and then just backtracked versus pulling Adam in for a discussion like an adult.  I have two kids too, I understand the quandary you're in but it doesn't justify it at all", "Enjoy the eviction.", "YTA. And about to be a homeless one. Good thing you\u2019re a mother of two so you won\u2019t be alone. Your daughter and her \u201ctoo good for work\u201d husband will be there too. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you. You very well just lost your housing", "Op, you realize there is middle ground between Adam and Steve? That Steve doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate shill but could get a full time job and pay his bills like an adult???? The fact that you\u2019re excusing Steve\u2019s laziness as \u201ccherishing family time\u201d is really messed up.\n\nAdam gave you an amazing opportunity to set you up in retirement and you\u2019ve violated his trust. I hope you\u2019re prepared to rely on Steve (ha!) to take care of you, because Adam would be well within his rights to kick you out and refuse to support you after this. \n\nWhat a joke, you can\u2019t be this oblivious. YTA.\n\nETA: I see your username is \u201cfairmom\u201d - there is nothing \u201cfair\u201d about this situation since this isn\u2019t even your property. Adam set a clear boundary, you lied and broke his trust for your incompetent and lazy SIL. You don\u2019t get to use another person\u2019s resources to support someone against their wishes and call it \u201cfair\u201d.", "Oh shit.... you really screwed up. Not because you helped your daughter. You\u2019re her mother & she needed help. You don\u2019t just stop helping your kids no matter how old they get. BUT why didn\u2019t you call Adam?!?! Just own it upfront. You tried to pull a fast one & got caught. Hopefully, Adam is understanding of the situation. Otherwise, y\u2019all are going to be homeless. And shame on your daughter for putting you in this position! Time to grow up!! \n\nYTA\n\neta \u2014 p.s. stop defending yourself (but I had a good reason).... Um no you didn\u2019t. You had no good reason to lie. Own your mistake. You lied by omission & thought you wouldn\u2019t get caught. Well ya did... so stop defending yourself. Your choice, your consequences.", "YTA.\n\nMaybe if Steve had some of Adam's sense, they wouldn't need to be in this situation. You're enabling them and abusing Adam's generosity.", "YTA \n\nYeah, you\u2019re a mother of two, but only one of your daughters has a hand in supporting you. The least you could do is express that gratitude by following a simple rule. \n\nI\u2019d be different is Steve wasn\u2019t constantly insulting the hand that supports him. He\u2019s proving Adam\u2019s point that he\u2019s someone that relies on handouts to get by. Yeah, working full-time sucks, but most adults can accept that it\u2019s necessary, especially when you have a family to support. If your daughter wants to make bad decisions and stay with an unmotivated slacker, let her. However, don\u2019t expect your son-in-law foot the bill for a lazy adult that can accept reality.", "Oh boy \n\nI can undestand you. But although I do not agree I can undestand your youngest also. There were clear rules and you knew them prior to moving in. \n\nSee thats the kind of thing I personally hate. You got them to provide for you now you need to obey their rules. And thats what you do not want now. But they do not want to support Steve and your eldest. They saw this coming which is why they set up the rules in the first place. \n\nI would not want to be in your shoes. Let someone you love down just because you have rules to obey. Your daughter and Adam try to control you. I do not know if you have other opportunities but I would have never gone that path. I just don't like others to tell me what to do and what not.

I think you need to have a honest conversation with your son in law/landlord and maybe look into the legality of his \"you must live alone\" demand so you can argue his rule os unfair and illegal.

I have 2 daughters who are civil to each other but don\u2019t get along with each other. My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met.\n\nSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies. \n\nAdam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early.\n\nSteve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society.\n\nNeither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well. \n\nI retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this.\n\nSteve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nI know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Jesus, these responses are vicious.  Yeah, OP, YTA because you broke a trust, but I also empathize with you being in a really tough spot.

Family is tough\u2026", "[removed]", "INFO: how can you only pay 1 dollar in rent and still have no reserves? Is your entire retirement based on your son in Laws income?", "I think Adam is the AH here. He set up a power play. The only option is he either gives you a house or not. You don't live under his thumb.", "You should start looking for a place to go with your daughter and partner, you broke their trust you\u2019re probably going to be asked to leave.

You're just enabling him. Why was he only working part time in the first place? Does your daughter have a high earning job? \nAdam did an incredibly nice thing for you and gave you one rule. You broke your end of the agreement.", "YTA, you\u2019re letting a man that openly disrespects Adam live in a house he pays for behind his back", "INFO: what\u2019s the time frame? Anything <3 months is okay, since that\u2019s the maximum time allowed to still be considered a visitor, so no landlord is allowed to interfere.", "ESH. Steve and Adam for insulting and judging each other, your daughter screaming at you for letting other daughter in, you for going behind Adam\u2019s back\u2026 It sounds like a mess. I know you mean well and you feel your daughter should not have to suffer for Steve\u2019s choices, but apparently your other daughter doesn\u2019t agree. Given your own precarious housing situation you should apologise to Adam and tell Steve and daughter that they must move out.", "YTA. You should have asked for permission first as it\u2019s not your house. Steve needed to ASK Adam for help since he is living in Adam\u2019s house!  You gave something away that wasn\u2019t yours to give.  Extremely disrespectful to Adam\u2019s generosity. \n\nSteve needs to grow a pair to man up and stop being lazy. He is what\u2019s wrong with society!", "Yta and Adam was righ about Steve, he wants to be free but don\u2019t have the financial responsibilities to provide for his family, you shouldn\u2019t have allowed then to move with you, because it\u2019s not your house to do so, now you may lose your living situation because of your older daughter", "YTA--And I hope you realize your daughter and Steve are never leaving, they clearly are trying to find a way to get a free house. \n\nI can't believe you asked your daughter to lie to her husband for you too.", "YTA. So Steve has his principles until it\u2019s time to pay the piper, then he has no problem living off Adam\u2019s tit.\n\nAnd it IS Adam\u2019s tit. \n\nAdam have you one rule, and in return you got to retire happily and comfortably for ONE DOLLAR a month.

The agreement was that NO ONE could come live with this woman. Who is retired and it sounds like disabled. This means that she couldn\u2019t get a live in nurse if she needed one. Or if she fell in love she couldn\u2019t have that person move in. There are a lot of situations where it might make sense to have a semi employed person move in with an elderly person to help out around the house. The SIL for some reason didn\u2019t say what he meant- that he didn\u2019t want the other daughter moving in with her husband. Why not just say that? If this was the problem he was expecting why not he frank about it especially if there was a fair chance this would happen.

There are just clear exceptions to everything, especially if it\u2019s in an emergency situation. I know that if I was a parent, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself knowing that I let my child go homeless without doing whatever I could to help. \n\nNow something you should\u2019ve absolutely done is probably run it by the ones you had the agreement with first and explain everything. They\u2019re probably more upset that you did it behind their back, instead of seeking them out. That\u2019s why they aren\u2019t TA\u2019s either, you did very much break their trust.

I know it's hard to watch your daughter struggle due to the consequences of her own decisions but that does not give you the right to extend Adam's generosity to them in any way you see fit, especially in ways that could set Adam and your daughter up for potential legal and social headaches.

Yeah - you definitely all suck here", "ESH they all sound like different sides of the same coin and utterly tiring.", "You really should've asked him first. YTA for that.

No matter what path in life you choose there's pros and cons and there's someone who will disagree with your choice so there's no needs for fight. Think Adam n steve need to see the benefits of each lifestyle not jst the negatives.

That\u2019s completely unacceptable.\n\nSteve needs to suck it up and get a proper job and learn to save money instead of blaming \u2018people like Adam\u2019 for his own shortcomings.\n\nI bet they are going to get *really* comfortable living with you for free and you will have a hell of a time getting rid of them now.", "YTA. You did precisely what you were told not to do. You are living in this house for free. Let's be honest, Adam is only charging you a dollar for tax purposes. Of course you were found out. Your utilities went up when they moved in! You should have spoken with Adam beforehand. You betrayed Adam's trust and it's likely he'll demand they move out. \n\nAnd by the way, Adam is right. Steve is a slacker and he's not taking good care of your daughter. My aunt has this mentality of \"can't take it with you\" and guess where it got her? She's still working at 82, because she never saved for retirement. All three of her children give her money every month to help care for her and she still spends. That's the road your daughter is looking at, OP.", "YTA. You clearly excused Steve working part time because he \u201cvalues family,\u201d but if he values his family he should have been adult enough to work full time to provide for them and have an emergency fund.

Kick your daughter and Steve out, call Adam right now and apologize and maybe you can salvage the situation.", "YTA\n\nYou could have asked Adam first but the fact you didn\u2019t speaks for itself - you knew this was probably the reason he set up this rule. There\u2019s probably much more to Steve and your daughter that you\u2019re leaving out.", "Yes. YTA", "YTA", "YTA because among other things you're setting your daughter up for a lifetime of struggle by enabling her husband to be an irresponsible leech. They knew they weren't financially stable.  They had time when they knew they couldn't pay the rent and he did nothing.  Your solution is to lie to the person who puts a roof over your head and trick him into supporting three people instead of one. You and your \"strict deadline\" sheesh. Their landlord gave them one too, how did that go? They know you won't evict them.  \n\nIf Steve can't support himself and is relying on Adam by proxy, that will end when either Adam throws you all out or you pass away and can't steal from Adam to give to Steve.

You break up that marriage and you're all stuck, aren't you?", "Soft YTA. \n\nAdam did something incredibly generous to build you a home and charge you essentially nothing to live there. And in return, you betrayed an established agreement and trust.\n\nI've softened the verdict because I understand that you are a mother and love your daughters. It would be impossible to stand by while your daughter faces homelessness. However, there was a better way to handle this, and it was to be open and honest with Adam. The ship has not sailed on honest communication, and I would start now. Call Adam, and tell him what has happened. Apologize for breaking the agreement, and ask if there's a solution that you can both come to consensus on. Maybe it might be paying market rent while your other daughter and SIL live with you? But, apologize and hope that Adam is the forgiving type.\n\nPS. Steve really needs to be more responsible. He put you and your daughter in a precarious position with his decisions. Perhaps he should consider apologizing to Adam for his flippant attitude since he's directly benefiting from the fruits of Adam's labour.", "YTA. You and your oldest seem to enable Steve\u2019s irresponsibility. He relies on your daughter financially, and now he wants you and Adam to support him as well. \n\nAdam is the only responsible one here. \n\nYou should have told Steve about your agreement with Adam, and then facilitated a conversation between Adam and Steve.", "YTA- would you rather all 3 of you be homeless because that\u2019s where you\u2019re headed. And you\u2019re also the asshole for begging your daughter not to tell her husband that you are intentionally breaking his rule and making her choose between you. Grow up.", "YTA, Adam is hard working and doing you a huge favor. Steve is lazy and is going to ruin your setup.", "YTA.  I\u2019m very far left and also can\u2019t stand the corporate types like Adam.  That being said, I still work FT and pay my bills and don\u2019t leech off others.  Steve has no sense of responsibility and your daughter puts up with him.  I understand you not wanting them to be homeless, but she could give Steve the boot and take care of herself.  Instead she comes to you crying.  I also almost guarantee she mentioned the situation to your youngest daughter and that\u2019s how she knows.  It\u2019s understandable that you love your children and want to help, but your daughter and Steve are taking advantage of your love and kindness.  You have basically a dream housing situation and don\u2019t appreciate it.  All you had to do was follow the one rule.", "So you are lying and manipulating and still having to ask if you are TA? Sounds like you really want a bunch of strangers to tell you that you did the right thing because they are both your daughters. The problem here is that is not your home, it is not even yours to allow people to move in or sublet! We\u2019re you planning on having them pay Adam for living in his home? We\u2019re you and your other daughter planning to lie to the other daughter and Adam? If so anyone with a brain can tell you those two things alone have just caused HUGE problems for you. Like honestly you might not have a place to live if I was your daughter who is Adams wife in this situation because who tf lies, manipulates, uses their flesh and blood who is literally taking care of you!", "Yes YTA!! You literally had one rule and couldn't just follow it.", "As much as the mother in me hates to say it, YTA.  I can completely understand wanting to help your kid who is in a bad situation, but you did so at the cost of the other\u2019s trust.  Her husband did you an enormous favor, and your response was to try to skirt the rules.  You should\u2019ve asked them about it first rather than try to hide it from them.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing that Adam could see this coming, hence the strange rule. Now you\u2019ve been caught in a lie caused by the ignorance and arrogance of others. The ones that didn\u2019t help you reach the level of comfort you have in life, but are happy to take advantage of it.\n\nIs there also another reason your eldest daughter is so upset? Do you favour your youngest daughter at the expense of her sister?", "YTA.\n\nIf Steve was smarter with his finances he and your daughter wouldn't be in the predicament they're in. Adam was more than generous with you in building you a custom house and letting you live in it practically for free. Like you said, you violated the deal and now you must deal with the consequences. You could have been honest and told Adam about the situation instead of going behind his back. He may have allowed it, but now we'll never know. Hopefully your eldest daughter will let you move in with them if or when Adam kicks you out.", "So what are you going to do if you are kicked out because you broke the rules. A tent for 3. YTA big time.", "YTA, but I'm afraid you're also an idiot. You didn't just break an agreement with your son in law, you  breached a contract with your landlord. You're a tenant in his property, and now he can evict you if he wants as well as your eldest daughter (I'll call her Lilith) and Steve. Your only hope now is to immediately kick out Lilith and Steve and go directly to Adam and apologize profusely for abusing his generosity and then trying to hide it from him.\n\nAll of this is true even if Adam is a corporate shill who is adding to the problem of corporate America buying up the majority of our housing supply and jacking up prices. But that's a discussion beyond the scope of this AITA post. You're still TA.", "YTA\n\nYou betrayed your promise to your Adam. There is a saying in our country that says: *\"The thanks of a donkey is a kick.\"*  It is used to describe people like you who, after people show them kindness, return the favor by giving them problems.\n\nSteve is a financially irresponsible man. In addition to frivolously spending money that he does not have, he was sanctimonious about it (even going so far as to insult Adam's hard work).\n\nSteve's financially irresponsible ways have finally caught up to his family. And what does he do? He finds a way to sneak into Adam's house to live there for free. Steve is a shameless hypocrite who is colluding with you to lie to Adam so that he can live in Adam's house. \n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself for living in a house that Adam provided to you, and then turning around and doing the one thing he asked you not to do. Stop using the excuse of motherhood. There is nothing honorable about lying to Adam in order to support the financially irresponsible Steve.", "YTA. \n\nMy favorite part is how Steve insults Adam and criticizes his job, but thanks to him (and the job) he's getting a free roof over his head. There's something so fulfilling about that specific thing. \n\nAnyway, you're contributing to the hypocrisy.

I\u2019m sure Adam made the only you there rule because he saw this coming. The worst part for me was that you didn\u2019t even think to talk to Adam first to maybe explain and try to work something out.

You forgot its not your house to invite your daughter into. It's Adam's house. You had no right. You should have 1). Asked Adam 2). Gave them money to pay rent. 3). Bought them a tent.", "YTA, what a gross, unfair mom.", "YTA\n\nYou purposely violated the rule for people who constantly disrespect the person who lets you live there for free.

You put literally zero thought into this. Then, your daughter never said she was kicked out. Just that she couldn\u2019t make the next months rent payment. You didn\u2019t have to let them move in.

If it wasn't your SIL who owned the house, if it was a regular landlord who said no one else can live there, would you have done the same thing? Probably not. You would've explained to your daughter that you can't lose your only place to live. Plus you have now put your daughter in the impossible position of lying to her husband or betraying your confidence knowing what a shitshow its going to be.\nYour SIL put you in a good position, built you a house, customized it just for you for $1 a month. His only condition was no one else lives there because he KNEW the other BIL is a mooch. Not working a full time job to support your family because you treasure time with them is complete and utter BS. We all work to support our families, and yes we all miss out on things because of that. Your daughter has allowed this while SHE works full time and misses out on things so HE can sit his ass at home and do what he wants. If you value and respect your SIL at all you will get them out of the house now and quickly. \nWhy do parents always protect and cherish the kids who do nothing to deserve it, and crap on the hardworking kids who build a good life for themselves and their families?

If Adam is everything that's wrong with society, then why do they want to live in his house when it's now convenient for them? If they want to live the lifestyle they were living before, then that's OK, but only if they have the means to. They clearly don't or have lost the means to, so its time for them to grow up, Steve to get another job and get out of the BIL's house. \n\nI don't blame your other daughter one bit for being upset with you. You've taken advantage of her husband, tried to hide what you did from them, and can't see why you're in the wrong. \n\nMy advice to you is to tell Steve and daughter you made a mistake, you have taken advantage of someone else and you need to make things right before you also lose your home (because Adam may be hurt enough to put you out) and further hurt Adam and other daughter and for you to do this they need to pack up and leave.

They should not have been this thrown off by the part time person losing his job.", "  Op's daughter definitely needs to tell Adam, asap,  otherwise she risks the relationship with her own husband, and op needs to re-evaluate just how well Steve has been treating her daughter, since the daughter has been working full time and Steve part time, and they are about to become homeless.", "Adam was 100% correct in his assessment of Steve, a person not even doing the bare minimum to be a useful member of society and expecting hand outs from others when something bad happens. I'm also wondering if he lost his job because his unwillingness to work was showing through at his work, and he was just be a lazy incompetent worker. They probably got stick of him taking lots of time off to travel and barely working part time. He probably would just be like \"hey boss, I'm taking off for a next starting tomorrow. That's fine right?\" The boss probably talked with him and gave him warnings, which he ignored and then to nobody's surprise (except maybe his own) he was fired.", "Also I\u2019m curious about that setup in the first place. He uses the excuse that he values time with his SO as to why he doesn\u2019t want a full time job\u2026 but was his wife also working part time? Or was she working full time? Because that would just negate the benefits. He wouldn\u2019t be seeing her any more than if he had a full time job anyway!", "Steve should stick to his values and not live in a House built by a corporate shill \ud83d\ude44(No sarcasm) \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "No see Steve only thinks Adam is a corporate shill when Adam\u2019s money doesn\u2019t benefit Steve.

Like, how is she being fair by getting her daughter in trouble by breaking the one rule she had?", "I understand wanting to live a bit now, but if you constantly spend, and have barely any savings, how do you plan to retire? Or do you plan to just work until you die?\n\nAlso how is Adam what's wrong with the world? He is just a hard worker who earned his position, unless there is more to it then op mentioned and he does have family money/connections not mentioned here, and is saving more to be able to retire early. My husband and I aren't doing as much traveling and spending as we could right now because we would rather be able to retire early. I'd rather retire when I still have energy to be able to make use of my free time!! I'd rather wait to travel until I'm retired and can spend as much time as I want at a place (or hiking) without worrying about work.", "> OP is the AH because when you're an adult, and someone gives you the gift of an essentially free house, you have to suck it up and live by their rules, or move out and find your own place.\n\nAnd Adam should not be expected to provide shelter to someone who slams him for being a \"corporate shill\"\n\nCall me what you want but if you say bad things to me you cannot turn around and tell me to give you free lodging. Ridiculous!", "Adam isn't what's wrong with the world.   Being a landlord doesn't automatically make you a social ill.\n\nBeing a landlord let him build and virtually gift his mother a house.  It also allows people who can't pay or get a mortgage to have a home.\n\nHe's no more an issue than people like Steve, grasshoppers, are.", "And then the daughter will get pregnant and it will turn into evicting a baby.", "\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47the question OP needs to be asking herself!", ">!OP's dishonesty could jeopardize her daughter 's relationship with her fiance.\n\n\nThat's one of the layers of OP's betrayal.", "One daughter I am willing to bet she never set rules or limits or held her to any accountability.", "More likely a handyman or landscaper SIL uses for his properties in the area who's been given a head's up to lookout for someone living with MIL", "This actually isn't too far fetched. We own a service business and are quite close with a few property owners. At one point we were discussing why we couldn't service this particular unit for him since it had like 12 people living in it, all sick with covid. That was news to him. Another unit had the tenant wreck it so badly that we also refused to enter. Or if there's a particularly spicy tenant that refuses to allow the unit to be worked on. We've accidentally outed people keeping dogs because the dogs are too threatening to allow entry and the tenants won't do anything. We don't mean to narc, but sometimes we have to let the owner know what's going on if it's interfering with our work. You'd be surprised what random details actually end up mattering.", "Oh ok, well that sucks. Here once you are a tenant you can do whatever you please except subrenting it or damaging/making important renovations. Landlord can't prevent you to invite people/have pets or whatever. You signed a lease, this is your home.\n\nI'm quite shocked by the comments tbh", "Lol, I was thinking more along the lines of, \"My evil rich son in law, kicked me, my daughter, jobless SIL and grandchildren out of my house and put me in a retirement home, with evil nurses.\"", "Everyone is describing Steve and OP\u2019s daughter as lazy mooches because they dared not to enter the capitalist rat race that we love to idolize in this country. Nothing indicates that they haven\u2019t been able to support themselves before or that they want to mooch forever. Everyone can fall on hard times. If I was OP I would be incredible disappointed in Adam and my other daughter that they wouldn\u2019t be willing to help out if they could, even just on a temporary, limited basis, despite the differences in philosophy. If the only other option is truly homelessness, why would you be okay with your sister being homeless or forcing your mother to turn away what little aid she can offer.", "Your imaginary girlfriend\u2019s cat knew it was coming.", "My real girlfriend who is definitely real but goes to another school knew this was coming.", "I only found out about Steve just now and I knew this was coming yesterday!", "I will add that OP says her eldest is being treated well, but this situation of not being prepared for anything is not well.", "Well, OP was gifted a house and still doesn't have any money left over at the end of the month. So I'm guessing OP can relate to Steve pretty well.", "\"He loves spending family time with daughter\" um, what? Lol. There's plenty of time to do that, and work while she's also working.", "Completely agree. The idea that he can't bring the money with him after he dies is also... very odd. Like, he's young (I assume), he likely will live 40-70 more years. Why is he not saving for that? Or putting aside money for future children (assuming they want kids). Dude needs to learn a lesson, and hopefully this experience will teach him", "Tell me OP favors Steve. Without telling me OP favors Steve!", "I got confused who it was because wouldn't you ethically try to avoid getting stuff from a sellout if they were the entire problem of society?", "i accidentally upvoted the sarcastic one and had to come back and fix it.", "This! Also, I understand that OP doesn't want to let her daughter be homeless. However, the fact is, OP does not seem to understand that she doesn't have the means to make her daughter not be homeless.

People in America are deeply capitalist & they really believe that there is no structural inequality & the the rich deserve all their wealth. It\u2019s why the country is failing apart, the cost of living is so high & the jobs & housing market are so bad we have a massive working houseless population. People really that this is the way things are supposed to be & we don\u2019t need any structural change. I\u2019m saying this based on working with a lot of poor people who believe people poorer than them are selfish greedy monsters looking for handouts & reading the actual news.", "True but also OP's money stuff could very much be due to the forced retirement for health reasons. Either way, I feel for Steve and OP's daughter because homelessness is always a terrifying possibility; but theres a difference between working a little less whilst you're young, and not having enough in your emergency fund to last you between securing part time employment", "This *really* stood out to me. I have a feeling Adam only went through with this whole arrangement because he was made to feel obligated to, probably by both his wife and OP. It sure says a lot that he made sure she paid $1 in rent to protect himself legally.\n\nAnd why on earth isn't OP paying for the increase in utilities? She pays $1 in rent and nothing in utilities, surely she has some money being spent on unnecessary things that could cover the difference.", "I was thinking the same thing. \"I'm on a fixed income;\" yeah, but you have no rent or utilities to pay. So where does that fixed income go?", ">OP was gifted a house and still doesn't have any money left over at the end of the month. So I'm guessing OP can relate to Steve pretty well\n\nWelp! That is true.\n\nPoor Adam. Looks like he's marrying into a family of grifters...", "Right?? Like rent and utilities are all paid for.

You just sound jealous", "Yeah reading things such as \"Steve is a slacker, that's his fault, he should get a good job\" vs \"Adam is working is ass off, you betrayed him\" is a super strange reaction for me, i was expecting a lot more empathy for Steve and a lot less \"admiration\" for Adam. Oh well...", "Okay. Thanks for explaining your viewpoint. I\u2019ll admit it didn\u2019t occur to me that you meant \u201cin trouble\u201d with her own spouse.
