{"id": 7974, "submission_id": "10ijnjo", "title": "AITA for letting my daughter and her husband move in with me so they won\u2019t be homeless?", "selftext": "This situation is complicated and I\u2019m at my wits end. I have 2 daughters who are civil to each other but don\u2019t get along with each other. My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met.\n\nSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies. \n\nAdam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early.\n\nSteve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society.\n\nNeither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well. \n\nI retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this.\n\nSteve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nI know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason.\n\nEdit\n\nI couldn\u2019t add many details in my original post because I was afraid of going over the character limits. \n\nAdam pays the taxes and utilities on this house but because it\u2019s the only house he has in this state, he keeps its financials separate from the rest of his properties. Also, he doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the house. Instead, he gave it over to my youngest to take care of so she handles all of the bills and maintenance and pays them out of an account he set up. She noticed the increased utility cost which is when she called. \n\nWe just spoke again and I laid my soul bare to her. I knew I was going back on our agreement but it was to keep her sister from being homeless. We had a lengthy conversation and in the end, she agreed not to tell Adam. She\u2019ll cover the increased utility cost out of her own pocket so he won\u2019t notice it. In exchange, her sister and Steve will have 3 months then will have to move out. I originally told them they had 6 months. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have such a compassionate daughter. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Some of the comments were very hurtful but some were helpful. You made me realize I should have called my youngest at the start and asked. That would have saved alot of tears.", "created_utc": 1674394025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ijnjo/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_and_her_husband_move/", "score": 8904, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You went back on an agreement that you made. Why didn't you call your youngest and tell her the situation instead of going behind their back?", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but Adam is doing you a favour by gletting you live in this house and he gave you one rule so he\u2019s not taken advantage of and not only did you break this rule but you did so by allowing the person who insults Adam to live there.\nYour daughter and her husband want to live by the values they have fair enough but they need to be able to have money to back that up. If by Steve losing his part time job they are in this much trouble then they didn\u2019t have the money to spend freely and go travelling to begin with.\nYeah you have two daughters but at the end of the day the person who owns this house has no obligation to house your adult daughter and her husband and honestly you so if you loose your home because of this then you only have yourself to blame.", "YTA, I'd say your were going for the better to all for forgiveness than permission type, but you didn't even plan on telling Adam. Given how you describe Steve, I'm betting they won't be out by X date.\n\nETA: I have a feeling Adam set that condition because he saw this coming.\n\nEdit: Based on OPs edit how many people think Steve and sister will be out in 3 months? I predict we see youngest post in 3 months. \"AITA for not telling my husband that my sister and BIL moved in with my mom\" because hiding big things like this from your future husband totally never turns out bad, right?", "YTA. \n\nYou're not renting. You're not paying any bills.\n\nYou had rules and you broke them.\n\nAdam is willing to pay for you, but not for anyone else.", "YTA\n\nI get the concern, but you dont get to be generous to your daughter and Steve on Adam's dime.   If you really wanted to do this, you should have asked Adam if he would agree to a short term exception, not gone behind his back.\n\nAlso, Steve needs to step up and help support his family.   Only working part-time so the family can spend more time together and travel is not a luxury he can afford.  He and your eldest daughter are also AHs for trying to do so on Adam's dime.  Especially after calling Adam a corporate shill and everything that's wrong with America blah blah blah.", "Awww Op I can understand you wanting to help your eldest daughter but you did the 1 thing you weren't supposed to do. YTA. I'm betting Adam figured this would happen eventually and that was why he made that 1 rule. \n\nSteve is irresponsible.. if he only worked part-time then I'm failing to see why he hasn't found another job already to keep him and his wife from becoming homeless.", "YTA Your future SIL is paying all your utilities and only charges $1, he done something incredibly generous for you.  You take advantage of him by secretly having him also provide for your daughter and her loser husband, he should kick all three of you out. Of course he was going to find out about them living there, there is a big difference in paying utilities for one person vs three people. Why should your daughter and her future husband support your other daughter and husband? He should kick all three of you out for taking advantage of him.\n\nEdited to add: Correct relationship error and... \n\nOP you are having your youngest daughter keep a huge secret from her fiance, this could end their relationship. How would you feel if that happens?", "You had an agreement and he went above and beyond building a house you don\u2019t have to pay for.\n\nYTA, hope he starts charging you 2 grand a month and puts utilities in your name so the bum SIL has to get a job and pay some bills.", "YTA. You had ONE job. \n\nAdam's right, Steve is a slacker, and now he's reaping the consequences of that.\n\nWhere are you, Steve, and your oldest daughter going to live when Adam kicks you out for breaching your agreement with him?", "YTA Steve sounds like a piece of work - he blames Adam for everything wrong in the world and calls him a corporate shill,yet has no issue leeching off of him. They're about to be homeless and he still won't work, he and your daughter are willing to jeopardize your living situation so they can continue the lifestyle they can't afford. You should have refused and made Steve work ( gasp!)full time. I don't blame your other daughter for being angry and now you've put her in a really difficult spot, you've lied and you want your daughter to lie to her husband? I can't believe this is how you repay your son in law's generosity- I have a feeling that rule was put in place specifically for those two freeloaders.", "Gentle YTA. Adam did something really nice for you and you\u2019ve basically spat in his face. You are also jeopardizing your own housing situation. Please call your daughter and Adam and apologize immediately. You also are going to have to tell your other daughter and Steve to leave. Steve does not have the luxury to work part-time if he doesn\u2019t have a place to live. You are enabling him at the risk of hurting yourself. Doesn\u2019t make very much sense.", "YTA. Everyone else covered a lot\u2026 But I\u2019m going to add that you need to call your daughter and apologize for asking her to keep a secret from Adam. That you would ask her this is just absolutely disgusting to me. Adam has every right to know that you don\u2019t respect him. And that\u2019s what this is, you don\u2019t respect the man that has gone above and beyond for you. Steve has spent a lot of energy on belittling and behaving like an ass towards Adam. And now you all expect Adam to bail him out? No. That\u2019s not how this works. Call your daughter, apologize and agree to tell Adam yourself. Frankly I understand why your daughter doesn\u2019t like her sister and her sisters hypocritical, lazy and quite frankly entitled husband.", "YTA\u2014 sorry OP, but you are a massive asshole. This guy built a house for you and asks you to pay $1 rent with the only condition that you don\u2019t allow others to live there. I don\u2019t know anyone living in such generous and giving conditions.\n\nSo yeah, you massively breached the trust of the giving hand. I understand your concern for your less successful daughter and her husband \u2014who works part time, so I guess your more successful son in law was right about him being a slacker, but the very least you could have done was to ask for permission.\n\nYou just burned the relationship and trust of the person who was allowing you to live so comfortably. Really dumb.", "He had one rule for you ONE and you broke it. Now you are gunna be homeless as well as your daughter. \n\nSteve is a free loader he needs to get another job and a full time job at that. So he can support HIS family not live off your daughter and your good will. \n\nThe further you bury your head the worst it's gunna get. Wake up and smell the roses or in this case the manure they are growing in. \n\nYTA", "Ok YTA. You are not helping them and steve and your oldest are lazy. You are encouraging bad behavior. Steve should work full time and so should your oldest. When someone loves their partner they don\u2019t let them go homeless, they try to make more money not to become homeless.He doesn\u2019t \u201ctreasure\u201d family time, he is irresponsible. Pls look at the red flags and stop helping them, or they will never grow up. How do you as a mother even think that steve is good for your kid?", "YTA, you are being supported financially by your daughter and her husband, that\u2019s what free rent is. You cannot then subsidise someone else. You should have asked, and respected adam and your daughters answer. If you really feel bad, tighten your belt for a while, give up your luxuries and give them money. Even that\u2019s a push with fairness if you\u2019re living rent free off someone else. \n\nI understand you don\u2019t want to see them homeless, but their attitude to money and security is what got them in the situation, not just losing a job", "Obvious YTA. Someone built you a house, and this is how you're returning that favor?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me.\" Expect your generous rental agreement to stop soon. Start looking for a new home, you will likely be evicted soon. YOU are the AH here. You broke their trust and lied to them. YOu broke the rental agreement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you can move in with Steve, wherever they will be living.", "You had one job. To not let anyone live in the house. Funny how Steve didn\u2019t like how Adam run his business but at the end, he\u2019s the one who end up on the verge of homelessness. With the stunt you pull, better pray Adam doesn\u2019t make you join them. YTA", "YTA. Clearly, Steve has a problem. He may love your daughter, but if he is only working part time, and that lost income is such a huge problem, then they couldn't afford their lifestyle to begin with. Steve should be out there flipping burgers or waiting tables. Places are hiring. It won't be the job he wants. But, it's something.", "YTA. You have no idea how good you have it. A luxury home and only $1 a month? And all you had to do was follow one simple rule. You understand that rule most likely was put in place because Adam knew your daughter and Steve would pull this stunt. Why should he pay for three extra people? Don\u2019t be surprised if he starts charging you actual rent, as he should.\n\nSo Steve only worked part-time because he treasures family time? As if everyone else who works full-time does not?  He had no business working part time and spending without a safety net. Playtime is over, Steve. It\u2019s time for him to be s big boy and get a full time job, and it\u2019s time for everyone around him to stop enabling him.", "ESH - Steve\u2019s a slacker and got his family into this. Adam is rigid and inflexible. You went behind Adam\u2019s back knowing there would be fallout. You should have called Adam immediately to lay out the situation. You didn\u2019t because you were afraid of his reaction, which is now worse than what it would have been. Time for a family meeting. I believe there is a reasonable solution.", "Such a bad decision. \n\nPlus, you hid it from them.\n\nAt best, maybe Adam will demand rent while Steve stays there.\n\nSteve needs to understand risk of becoming homeless is a consequence of his lifestyle.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Steve clearly isn't responsible if they're traveling but don't have enough savings to hold them over in case of emergency. Adam had 1 rule and you broke it. You need to tell Steve and your daughter to get into a shelter asap as you don't end up homeless along with them.", "YTA \n\nYou knew the rules, there wasn\u2019t any ambiguity in your housing arrangement.", "Unfortunately you allowed your need to accommodate your daughter and Steve to jeopardize your living situation.\nI understand as a parent, however, your child is a victim of her and her husband's lifestyle. Sounds like you're all going to be out on the street. YTA to yourself for putting your living situation in jeopardy.", "YTA. \n\nWith all due respect for caring for your daughter and for being Adam's mother in law - that house is not your property to do with as you please. You don't get to decide who can live there and for how little or long.\n\nAdam worked hard and sacrificed much to be able to set you up so comfortably, and you repayed him by using his sacrifice to spare Steve from the consequences of his own lackadaisical lifestyle.\n\nI'd be furious if I was him.", "You're effectively living for free and you think it's ok to change the terms. YTA whether it's for a good cause or not", "YTA - if Adam owns the house & pays all utilities why would you EVER think it\u2019s okay to move more people in without approval? This is a huge problem because while Steve & his wife are struggling, you\u2019ve sent them the message it\u2019s OK to do what you\u2019ve done. It was as simple as explaining to your daughter that you have restrictions to your living arrangement & you will try to help in another direction.", "YTA.\n\nAlso frankly, the hypocrisy of Steve is astounding - he shits on Adam because he, y'know, actually works for a living and then he's more than happy to take advantage and mooch off the money Adam earns.\n\nAnd you're enabling that.", "Sorry, but you don't own the house.\n\nYTA", "YTA, you had very simple rules to follow in exchange for a really sweet deal on your rent.  You didn\u2019t ask for an exception because you knew the answer ( or thought you did, people can surprise us).  You intentionally broke the rule, you broke your younger daughter and fianc\u00e9 trust.  Hope it was worth it.", "YTA. And, your daughter and her raggedy husband are all AH. He hates people like his BIL\u2026.until he needs something from his BIL. You obviously didn\u2019t plan for your future and now depend on your SIL. I hope their marriage stays strong cause the man has to work all the time to support a family of users and losers.", "Very gently because I know I know you mean well, but YTA\n\nAdam could see that Steve and your other daughter would be really irresponsible and need help after some time. He and his spouse didn\u2019t want to be the ones supporting the other pair. And now you\u2019re doing just that.\n\nYou could have at the very least asked them but you chose not to", "Yta and if I was then I would kick you out", "YTA.  You tried to sneak 2 people into a place provided for you.  You could have at least talked to them.", "**YTA**, Adam is doing you a huge favor and you\u2019re intentionally disregarding his very clear request in turn. You\u2019re being an asshole for accepting his charity then stepping all over his boundaries.\n\nYou\u2019re also being quite foolish in doing so. Do you have a backup plan for living arrangements? You\u2019re doing your best to create a situation where you\u2019ll need it..", "Adam isn\u2019t even your son in law yet and still built you a house to live in.  That was exceedingly generous. And yet you still betrayed his one stipulation.  And you broke that agreement but somehow think your eldest daughter and her husband will keep theirs???  It\u2019s likely they will never move out. YTA. And you live rent free in a house customized for you even!!! but seem to have zero money saved to help your eldest daughter?   I think you are not being honest and just want to ride out on Adams money without parting with any of yours.", "YTA. Adam probably made that rule because he knew Mr \"Live for the moment\" would show up at your doorstep at some point wanting to mooch off him. \n\nSure, you can't take it with you, but it's irresponsible to not save anything for emergencies or retirement.", "YTA which is ironic because I\u2019d probably take Steve\u2019s side on the \u201cAdams the cause of society\u2019s woes\u201d debate, but from the sound of things Steve has been a shortsighted jackass. \n\n\u201cSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter\u201d that\u2019s nice. How about working FULL time because he treasures your daughter and wants to make sure that if he were to lose his job for a period of time he has some options other than moving into a house with his MIL that he\u2019s not allowed in?\n\nIt seems really clear that the reason the policy was that the house built was for you and you alone is because Adam was anticipating this exact scenario.\n\nWanna help Steve? Take some of the money that you\u2019re saving and help them find a spot elsewhere and make him get fully employed so they\u2019re back on their feet. Then apologize to Steve and your Eldest for going back on your promise and try to make it up to them.\n\nEdit: had the names mixed up", "YTA.", "YTA \nSteve is a juvenile knob. \nAdam sounds amazing.", "YTA. I hope you get evicted", "YTA lets be honest Steve is super short sighted and you bailing him and your daughter out is just enabling his frankly dumb views. Adam should by all means throw you all out of his house, maybe your younger daughter can convince him not to. But honestly why should she strain her relationship with Adam to help:\n\n\\-a sister she already does not get along with\n\n\\-the sisters husband that has insulted her fiance before\n\n\\-her mother who lied to her and betrayed her trust\n\nNone of you deserve their mercy at this point and for your sake I hope they are more generous then I would be.", "YTA, I'm pretty sure when you're homeless Steve will not let you move in with them.", "YTA. They are going to be homeless because of their poor decision making. Your are simply enabling their bad decisions. \n\nAdam was right and Steve and your daughter\u2019s life philosophy got then into the mess they are in. He has no reason to support two people who don\u2019t want to work and purposely make bad financial decisions.", "See what happened is you have fucked around and not about to find out. Steve is a bum who doesn't want to get a job period. You are enabling them and Adam is 100% correct on Steve. They are homeless because of their own actions and from what you described of Steve he will try to live with you indefinitely and you'll lose everything so good luck to you\n\nYTA", "YTA and the way you describe your two son IL\u2019s is weird.  You talk about Steve like he is a gem but his beliefs led to being homeless and somehow you don\u2019t find nothing wrong with that? Adam was right to call him lazy and expecting handouts cause that is exactly what he did.", "Soft YTA. Adam wants to take care of you because you\u2019re a sweet person, but he put those stipulations in place because he didn\u2019t want your sweetness to get taken advantage of. Too, enabling Steve and your other daughter into not taking full responsibility for their lives will only hurt them in the long run.", "**YTA** \n\nYou are getting a wonderful deal from Adam that he worked hard for. \n\nSteve can get a full time job and stop sponging off his MIL and BIL.", "What you *should have done* is talk to Adam and get his permission. I think he would have gladly allowed it, because then he\u2019d be able to hold it over Steve\u2019s head for life.\n\nYou broke the terms of your gift lease. YTA", "YTA. Now you get to all be homeless together. Great planning.", "YTA - hate to say this but you\u2019re a conniving abuser of your family\u2019s trust.", "YTA twice\n\nOnce because you broke the agreement\nTwice because what\u2019s going to be different when the time limit passes and they don\u2019t have a place. Will it be ok for them to be homeless then but not now or will you break the agreement.\nThrice because of Steve thinks Adams is what is wrong in this world, he shouldn\u2019t be using Adam\u2019s extended charity to get by.\n\nHopefully you don\u2019t all end up homeless though that is what you are working towards", "YTA- Adam built you a customized home and charged you almost nothing in rent and all you had to do is not let anyone else live there, but you decided to do the literal only thing you were asked not to do. And here\u2019s a tip for Steve and your oldest- live within their means. It\u2019s great that Steve prioritizes family but if he doesn\u2019t want to work full time than they need to live within the money that they have. Does it suck? Yea. But that\u2019s life", "YTA-for lying. You should have discussed the situation with Adam and your daughter. They might have negotiated with you, or not. \n\nThis space was not yours to give.", "YTA. Steve has no problem taking advantage of the corporate shills generosity does he?\n\nAs you broke the one rule he gave you, now you have a good chance of being homeless. For cutting out loud, he even pays your utilities!!!!\n\nI would be furious if I was taken advantage of in this way.\n\nWhat you should have done was asked permission, not gone behind their backs. You have betrayed them.", "Ah, how quickly Steve's values went out the window when he needed something from Adam. YTA. Adam has been extremely kind & generous to you with the only stipulation as your landlord of no roommates. My 1st thought he probably envisaged this very situation. He's now paying to house 3 adults who aren't yet related to him. I understand its a horrible position to be in, but you weren't actually in a position to say yes to them & have put yourself in a very precarious position with your own housing. You've put your daughter in a horrible position by asking her not to tell Adam.", "NTA. Adam sounds like a huge AH. It seems the rule was made specifically so that your other daughter and Steve couldn\u2019t stay there. I think the most telling thing will be how he reacts when he finds out. If he threatens to kick you out, definitely he\u2019s TA. This deal was never to help you, I suspect. It was to look like the good guy and exert control more than anything. Kind, helpful people do not place unreasonable conditions on their help.\n\nOriginal comment removed\u2026edited to fix the only thing I can imagine was the problem. If not, it was nice knowing the sub, I guess.", "YTA", "YTA.  You made a commitment to someone who spoiled you and then just backtracked versus pulling Adam in for a discussion like an adult.  I have two kids too, I understand the quandary you're in but it doesn't justify it at all", "Enjoy the eviction.", "YTA. And about to be a homeless one. Good thing you\u2019re a mother of two so you won\u2019t be alone. Your daughter and her \u201ctoo good for work\u201d husband will be there too. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you. You very well just lost your housing", "Op, you realize there is middle ground between Adam and Steve? That Steve doesn\u2019t have to be a corporate shill but could get a full time job and pay his bills like an adult???? The fact that you\u2019re excusing Steve\u2019s laziness as \u201ccherishing family time\u201d is really messed up.\n\nAdam gave you an amazing opportunity to set you up in retirement and you\u2019ve violated his trust. I hope you\u2019re prepared to rely on Steve (ha!) to take care of you, because Adam would be well within his rights to kick you out and refuse to support you after this. \n\nWhat a joke, you can\u2019t be this oblivious. YTA.\n\nETA: I see your username is \u201cfairmom\u201d - there is nothing \u201cfair\u201d about this situation since this isn\u2019t even your property. Adam set a clear boundary, you lied and broke his trust for your incompetent and lazy SIL. You don\u2019t get to use another person\u2019s resources to support someone against their wishes and call it \u201cfair\u201d.", "Oh shit.... you really screwed up. Not because you helped your daughter. You\u2019re her mother & she needed help. You don\u2019t just stop helping your kids no matter how old they get. BUT why didn\u2019t you call Adam?!?! Just own it upfront. You tried to pull a fast one & got caught. Hopefully, Adam is understanding of the situation. Otherwise, y\u2019all are going to be homeless. And shame on your daughter for putting you in this position! Time to grow up!! \n\nYTA\n\neta \u2014 p.s. stop defending yourself (but I had a good reason).... Um no you didn\u2019t. You had no good reason to lie. Own your mistake. You lied by omission & thought you wouldn\u2019t get caught. Well ya did... so stop defending yourself. Your choice, your consequences.", "YTA.\n\nMaybe if Steve had some of Adam's sense, they wouldn't need to be in this situation. You're enabling them and abusing Adam's generosity.", "YTA \n\nYeah, you\u2019re a mother of two, but only one of your daughters has a hand in supporting you. The least you could do is express that gratitude by following a simple rule. \n\nI\u2019d be different is Steve wasn\u2019t constantly insulting the hand that supports him. He\u2019s proving Adam\u2019s point that he\u2019s someone that relies on handouts to get by. Yeah, working full-time sucks, but most adults can accept that it\u2019s necessary, especially when you have a family to support. If your daughter wants to make bad decisions and stay with an unmotivated slacker, let her. However, don\u2019t expect your son-in-law foot the bill for a lazy adult that can accept reality.", "Oh boy \n\nI can undestand you. But although I do not agree I can undestand your youngest also. There were clear rules and you knew them prior to moving in. \n\nSee thats the kind of thing I personally hate. You got them to provide for you now you need to obey their rules. And thats what you do not want now. But they do not want to support Steve and your eldest.

Your daughter and Adam try to control you. I do not know if you have other opportunities but I would have never gone that path. I just don't like others to tell me what to do and what not. But thats your decision if you trade freedom for utilities. \n\nYou took the house knowig the rules full well so YTA. \n\nYou knew Adam and your daughter would not agree. You went behind their back. They found out. Now you have a mess. But you only went behind their back because you knew exactly what the reaction would be. \n\nJust wonder why your daughter and Adam are so controlling.

But then you also have to play by the rules.", "Seems like a complex situation. I'd say YTA for breaking the agreement and going behind his back.

That said, hoping you nobody finds out your breaking a rule isn't a sustainable houding solution for any one. I think you need to have a honest conversation with your son in law/landlord and maybe look into the legality of his \"you must live alone\" demand so you can argue his rule os unfair and illegal. Many states do not allow a landlord to demand single occupancy unless the landlord lives in the house w/ the tenant.", "YTA", "Yta.  ESH.  Your concern for your daughter is understandable.

Their behaviour is completely irresponsible and disconnected from reality. Of course he doesn't need to work 80h a week, that's extreme and unhealthy.

YTA. Adam did and is doing this amazing thing for you, and you did the one thing that you knew he would hate the most.  You didn't even ask. You betrayed his trust and that of your younger daughter.

I have 2 daughters who are civil to each other but don\u2019t get along with each other. My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met.\n\nSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies. \n\nAdam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early.\n\nSteve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society.\n\nNeither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well. \n\nI retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this.\n\nSteve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nI know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Jesus, these responses are vicious.  Yeah, OP, YTA because you broke a trust, but I also empathize with you being in a really tough spot. You should have started with a conversation with your youngest and maybe have had the two siblings work it out. I hope you can resolve this and nobody winds up homeless. Family is tough\u2026", "[removed]", "INFO: how can you only pay 1 dollar in rent and still have no reserves? Is your entire retirement based on your son in Laws income?", "I think Adam is the AH here. He set up a power play. The only option is he either gives you a house or not. You don't live under his thumb.", "You should start looking for a place to go with your daughter and partner, you broke their trust you\u2019re probably going to be asked to leave. YTA you didn\u2019t even ask the person who own the house.", "INFO What is the timeframe, and how many bedrooms are in your home?", "YTA. Steve needs to get his shit together. You're just enabling him. Why was he only working part time in the first place? Does your daughter have a high earning job? \nAdam did an incredibly nice thing for you and gave you one rule. You broke your end of the agreement.", "YTA, you\u2019re letting a man that openly disrespects Adam live in a house he pays for behind his back", "INFO: what\u2019s the time frame? Anything <3 months is okay, since that\u2019s the maximum time allowed to still be considered a visitor, so no landlord is allowed to interfere.", "ESH. Steve and Adam for insulting and judging each other, your daughter screaming at you for letting other daughter in, you for going behind Adam\u2019s back\u2026 It sounds like a mess. I know you mean well and you feel your daughter should not have to suffer for Steve\u2019s choices, but apparently your other daughter doesn\u2019t agree. Given your own precarious housing situation you should apologise to Adam and tell Steve and daughter that they must move out.", "YTA. You should have asked for permission first as it\u2019s not your house. Steve needed to ASK Adam for help since he is living in Adam\u2019s house!  You gave something away that wasn\u2019t yours to give.  Extremely disrespectful to Adam\u2019s generosity. \n\nSteve needs to grow a pair to man up and stop being lazy. He is what\u2019s wrong with society!", "Yta and Adam was righ about Steve, he wants to be free but don\u2019t have the financial responsibilities to provide for his family, you shouldn\u2019t have allowed then to move with you, because it\u2019s not your house to do so, now you may lose your living situation because of your older daughter", "YTA--And I hope you realize your daughter and Steve are never leaving, they clearly are trying to find a way to get a free house. \n\nI can't believe you asked your daughter to lie to her husband for you too.", "YTA. So Steve has his principles until it\u2019s time to pay the piper, then he has no problem living off Adam\u2019s tit.\n\nAnd it IS Adam\u2019s tit. \n\nAdam have you one rule, and in return you got to retire happily and comfortably for ONE DOLLAR a month. You couldn\u2019t even abide by that.", "YTA, OP and not very bright. You didn\u2019t keep your word and can no longer trusted to stay there either. Don\u2019t be surprised if you are now homeless as well and I know you won\u2019t be able to rely on Steve for assistance because he\u2019s a bum.", "Am I the only one who sees a NTA angle? The agreement was that NO ONE could come live with this woman. Who is retired and it sounds like disabled. This means that she couldn\u2019t get a live in nurse if she needed one. Or if she fell in love she couldn\u2019t have that person move in. There are a lot of situations where it might make sense to have a semi employed person move in with an elderly person to help out around the house. The SIL for some reason didn\u2019t say what he meant- that he didn\u2019t want the other daughter moving in with her husband. Why not just say that? If this was the problem he was expecting why not he frank about it especially if there was a fair chance this would happen. He\u2019s just setting up a financial argument with a retired disabled woman who is going to be put in an impossible situation.", "I\u2019m going with NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t have the heart to call you TA for breaking the agreement. There are just clear exceptions to everything, especially if it\u2019s in an emergency situation. I know that if I was a parent, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself knowing that I let my child go homeless without doing whatever I could to help. \n\nNow something you should\u2019ve absolutely done is probably run it by the ones you had the agreement with first and explain everything. They\u2019re probably more upset that you did it behind their back, instead of seeking them out. That\u2019s why they aren\u2019t TA\u2019s either, you did very much break their trust. I can see why you didn\u2019t do that, however, because they probably would\u2019ve protested, and that would\u2019ve been a large headache that nobody wants.", "YTA they know it\u2019s Adams house and they are taking advantage of you instead getting their shit together.", "NTA.

In some areas, Steve and your other daughter will be legal tenants requiring a full, difficult, legal eviction process if Adam doesn't want them to continue living there for free after you die.

I know it's hard to watch your daughter struggle due to the consequences of her own decisions but that does not give you the right to extend Adam's generosity to them in any way you see fit, especially in ways that could set Adam and your daughter up for potential legal and social headaches.

Yeah - you definitely all suck here", "ESH they all sound like different sides of the same coin and utterly tiring.", "You really should've asked him first. YTA for that.  But it definitely unfair for them to expect a mother to watch their child become homeless. This fued between the 2 \nIs stupid. No matter what path in life you choose there's pros and cons and there's someone who will disagree with your choice so there's no needs for fight. Think Adam n steve need to see the benefits of each lifestyle not jst the negatives.

Coders cmon", "YTA.

That\u2019s completely unacceptable.\n\nSteve needs to suck it up and get a proper job and learn to save money instead of blaming \u2018people like Adam\u2019 for his own shortcomings.\n\nI bet they are going to get *really* comfortable living with you for free and you will have a hell of a time getting rid of them now.", "YTA. You did precisely what you were told not to do. You are living in this house for free. Let's be honest, Adam is only charging you a dollar for tax purposes. Of course you were found out. Your utilities went up when they moved in! You should have spoken with Adam beforehand. You betrayed Adam's trust and it's likely he'll demand they move out. \n\nAnd by the way, Adam is right. Steve is a slacker and he's not taking good care of your daughter. My aunt has this mentality of \"can't take it with you\" and guess where it got her? She's still working at 82, because she never saved for retirement. All three of her children give her money every month to help care for her and she still spends. That's the road your daughter is looking at, OP.", "YTA. You clearly excused Steve working part time because he \u201cvalues family,\u201d but if he values his family he should have been adult enough to work full time to provide for them and have an emergency fund. Just admit you prefer Steve, but enjoy the benefits you get from the one actually being a responsible adult.", "YTA", "You broke an agreement, not cool and is wrong. But to judge you as on asshole?

Why do you think Steve made it abundantly clear that no one else was to live in the house?

Kick your daughter and Steve out, call Adam right now and apologize and maybe you can salvage the situation.", "YTA\n\nYou could have asked Adam first but the fact you didn\u2019t speaks for itself - you knew this was probably the reason he set up this rule. There\u2019s probably much more to Steve and your daughter that you\u2019re leaving out.", "Yes. YTA", "YTA", "YTA because among other things you're setting your daughter up for a lifetime of struggle by enabling her husband to be an irresponsible leech. They knew they weren't financially stable.  They had time when they knew they couldn't pay the rent and he did nothing.  Your solution is to lie to the person who puts a roof over your head and trick him into supporting three people instead of one. You and your \"strict deadline\" sheesh. Their landlord gave them one too, how did that go? They know you won't evict them.  \n\nIf Steve can't support himself and is relying on Adam by proxy, that will end when either Adam throws you all out or you pass away and can't steal from Adam to give to Steve.

You break up that marriage and you're all stuck, aren't you?", "Soft YTA. \n\nAdam did something incredibly generous to build you a home and charge you essentially nothing to live there. And in return, you betrayed an established agreement and trust.\n\nI've softened the verdict because I understand that you are a mother and love your daughters. It would be impossible to stand by while your daughter faces homelessness. However, there was a better way to handle this, and it was to be open and honest with Adam. The ship has not sailed on honest communication, and I would start now. Call Adam, and tell him what has happened. Apologize for breaking the agreement, and ask if there's a solution that you can both come to consensus on. Maybe it might be paying market rent while your other daughter and SIL live with you? But, apologize and hope that Adam is the forgiving type.\n\nPS. Steve really needs to be more responsible. He put you and your daughter in a precarious position with his decisions. Perhaps he should consider apologizing to Adam for his flippant attitude since he's directly benefiting from the fruits of Adam's labour.", "YTA. You and your oldest seem to enable Steve\u2019s irresponsibility. He relies on your daughter financially, and now he wants you and Adam to support him as well. \n\nAdam is the only responsible one here. \n\nYou should have told Steve about your agreement with Adam, and then facilitated a conversation between Adam and Steve.", "YTA- would you rather all 3 of you be homeless because that\u2019s where you\u2019re headed. And you\u2019re also the asshole for begging your daughter not to tell her husband that you are intentionally breaking his rule and making her choose between you. Grow up.", "YTA, Adam is hard working and doing you a huge favor. Steve is lazy and is going to ruin your setup.", "YTA.  I\u2019m very far left and also can\u2019t stand the corporate types like Adam.  That being said, I still work FT and pay my bills and don\u2019t leech off others.  Steve has no sense of responsibility and your daughter puts up with him.  I understand you not wanting them to be homeless, but she could give Steve the boot and take care of herself.  Instead she comes to you crying.  I also almost guarantee she mentioned the situation to your youngest daughter and that\u2019s how she knows.  It\u2019s understandable that you love your children and want to help, but your daughter and Steve are taking advantage of your love and kindness.  You have basically a dream housing situation and don\u2019t appreciate it.  All you had to do was follow the one rule.", "So you are lying and manipulating and still having to ask if you are TA? Sounds like you really want a bunch of strangers to tell you that you did the right thing because they are both your daughters. The problem here is that is not your home, it is not even yours to allow people to move in or sublet! We\u2019re you planning on having them pay Adam for living in his home? We\u2019re you and your other daughter planning to lie to the other daughter and Adam? If so anyone with a brain can tell you those two things alone have just caused HUGE problems for you. Like honestly you might not have a place to live if I was your daughter who is Adams wife in this situation because who tf lies, manipulates, uses their flesh and blood who is literally taking care of you!", "Yes YTA!! You literally had one rule and couldn't just follow it.", "As much as the mother in me hates to say it, YTA.  I can completely understand wanting to help your kid who is in a bad situation, but you did so at the cost of the other\u2019s trust.  Her husband did you an enormous favor, and your response was to try to skirt the rules.  You should\u2019ve asked them about it first rather than try to hide it from them.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing that Adam could see this coming, hence the strange rule. Now you\u2019ve been caught in a lie caused by the ignorance and arrogance of others. The ones that didn\u2019t help you reach the level of comfort you have in life, but are happy to take advantage of it.\n\nIs there also another reason your eldest daughter is so upset? Do you favour your youngest daughter at the expense of her sister?", "YTA.\n\nIf Steve was smarter with his finances he and your daughter wouldn't be in the predicament they're in. Adam was more than generous with you in building you a custom house and letting you live in it practically for free. Like you said, you violated the deal and now you must deal with the consequences. You could have been honest and told Adam about the situation instead of going behind his back. He may have allowed it, but now we'll never know. Hopefully your eldest daughter will let you move in with them if or when Adam kicks you out.", "So what are you going to do if you are kicked out because you broke the rules. A tent for 3. YTA big time.", "YTA, but I'm afraid you're also an idiot. You didn't just break an agreement with your son in law, you  breached a contract with your landlord. You're a tenant in his property, and now he can evict you if he wants as well as your eldest daughter (I'll call her Lilith) and Steve. Your only hope now is to immediately kick out Lilith and Steve and go directly to Adam and apologize profusely for abusing his generosity and then trying to hide it from him.\n\nAll of this is true even if Adam is a corporate shill who is adding to the problem of corporate America buying up the majority of our housing supply and jacking up prices. But that's a discussion beyond the scope of this AITA post. You're still TA.", "YTA\n\nYou betrayed your promise to your Adam. There is a saying in our country that says: *\"The thanks of a donkey is a kick.\"*  It is used to describe people like you who, after people show them kindness, return the favor by giving them problems.\n\nSteve is a financially irresponsible man. In addition to frivolously spending money that he does not have, he was sanctimonious about it (even going so far as to insult Adam's hard work).\n\nSteve's financially irresponsible ways have finally caught up to his family. And what does he do? He finds a way to sneak into Adam's house to live there for free. Steve is a shameless hypocrite who is colluding with you to lie to Adam so that he can live in Adam's house. \n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself for living in a house that Adam provided to you, and then turning around and doing the one thing he asked you not to do. Stop using the excuse of motherhood. There is nothing honorable about lying to Adam in order to support the financially irresponsible Steve.", "YTA. \n\nMy favorite part is how Steve insults Adam and criticizes his job, but thanks to him (and the job) he's getting a free roof over his head. There's something so fulfilling about that specific thing. \n\nAnyway, you're contributing to the hypocrisy. And Adam should start charging you (way more than just one symbolic dollar) for rent.", "YTA\n\nA suggestion: why not hosting your daughter but no her husband? Or maybe he ousted the rest of his actual family as well?", "[deleted]", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re surprised that Adam noticed the utilities bill shot up because of two additional people moving in?

I\u2019m sure Adam made the only you there rule because he saw this coming. The worst part for me was that you didn\u2019t even think to talk to Adam first to maybe explain and try to work something out.

You forgot its not your house to invite your daughter into. It's Adam's house. You had no right. You should have 1). Asked Adam 2). Gave them money to pay rent. 3). Bought them a tent.", "YTA, what a gross, unfair mom.", "YTA\n\nYou purposely violated the rule for people who constantly disrespect the person who lets you live there for free. It\u2019s not even a good cover. You don\u2019t pay your own bills. How were you going to justify the increase in utilities? The increase in food? Water usage? You put literally zero thought into this. Then, your daughter never said she was kicked out. Just that she couldn\u2019t make the next months rent payment. You didn\u2019t have to let them move in.

If it wasn't your SIL who owned the house, if it was a regular landlord who said no one else can live there, would you have done the same thing? Probably not. You would've explained to your daughter that you can't lose your only place to live. Plus you have now put your daughter in the impossible position of lying to her husband or betraying your confidence knowing what a shitshow its going to be.\nYour SIL put you in a good position, built you a house, customized it just for you for $1 a month. His only condition was no one else lives there because he KNEW the other BIL is a mooch. Not working a full time job to support your family because you treasure time with them is complete and utter BS. We all work to support our families, and yes we all miss out on things because of that. Your daughter has allowed this while SHE works full time and misses out on things so HE can sit his ass at home and do what he wants. If you value and respect your SIL at all you will get them out of the house now and quickly. \nWhy do parents always protect and cherish the kids who do nothing to deserve it, and crap on the hardworking kids who build a good life for themselves and their families?

If Adam is everything that's wrong with society, then why do they want to live in his house when it's now convenient for them? If they want to live the lifestyle they were living before, then that's OK, but only if they have the means to. They clearly don't or have lost the means to, so its time for them to grow up, Steve to get another job and get out of the BIL's house. \n\nI don't blame your other daughter one bit for being upset with you. You've taken advantage of her husband, tried to hide what you did from them, and can't see why you're in the wrong. \n\nMy advice to you is to tell Steve and daughter you made a mistake, you have taken advantage of someone else and you need to make things right before you also lose your home (because Adam may be hurt enough to put you out) and further hurt Adam and other daughter and for you to do this they need to pack up and leave. You understand the position they are in, but they are in it because of the choices they as adults made and that you're sorry, but they will have to get themselves out of it.

Where will you live and who will pay for your bills?** Because it's 99,99% that you get evicted after the break up you had a hand in or even if by some miracle you are allowed to stay you will be paying market rent and utilities. \n\nYour younger is an idiot to take your side and agree to keep this from her future husband, but she probably (falsely) feels that she would be the reason if you have to move out because of your own sneaky backstabbing stupidity, she feels cornered because of you. \n\nTell your oldest and her husband that they have a week to move out, tell your youngest that you are sorry and come clean to Adam ASAP (today or tomorrow) and hope you won't be homeless alongside with your oldest and hope that your youngest's relationship survives. If you want to help your oldest, give them some money. Even if you don't have a lot of income, you should have some left every month, because you don't pay anything for your living arrangement, don't pay bills. Or you should have called Adam before you offered them to move in and ask him to let them stay for x time and offer to cover the increase in utility.", "YTA. Big time, even more so with your edit. So now you have your daughter lying to her husband. And if he finds out, what then? You absolutely should not be putting her marriage at risk. \nWhat the hell are you thinking?????", "100%.  I said this in another comment but that edit made it worse!  He saw it coming, put down rules, they will NOT be out in 3 months (the men already have a strained relationship so there\u2019s no way that Steve won\u2019t be walking around like \u201cwell who cares that we\u2019re not paying anything, he already makes so much and takes away peoples ability to own\u201d and every other thing he\u2019s already said, all the while working part time to not at all).  Then the cherry on top being that now the daughter is lying by omission to the one person in the family that they\u2019re all dependent on.  Yeah, this will turn out great\n\nEdit to add: OP, if you are living on a fixed income to the point that you are only paying $1 a month and no utilities and still can\u2019t afford to financially help them rent another place you need to understand how badly this could go for you.  You are a tenant breaking a lease agreement.  What if he finds out in 2 months and evicts you?! Right or wrong, you are completely and totally financially dependent on your landlord.

I dont think she is yta but man o man she is showing bad judgement here", "YTA.\n\nI treasure family time with my husband too, and we like to go places and collect experiences, but we both work full time to do so. Steve's attitude is not workable at this point in time unless he gets hold of a trust fund or hits MegaMillions. And he \"spends freely...\" with WHAT? His part time pocket money?\n\nI read your edit and I know you know you were wrong but talk about not just biting the hand that feeds you, but ripping it off and feeding it to a underemployed leech who could support his family and chooses not to. Dear God.\n\nDon't expect grace if Adam does find out, and consider what strain you're putting on your younger daughter's marriage. If Adam cuts you both loose, what will you have then?", "Steve is the worst, you should have accepted your daughter to live there briefly without that dead weight you call Steve.\n\nJust to add, making your youngest daughter lie for you and potentially jeopardising/causing problems in her marriage is not a good way to go about it, you knew the rules.", "YTA A D IF Adam throws you out who'd blame him. You had one rule. You are not to be trusted..Why are you self-sabotaging yourself. Tell Steve to support his family/move in with his side of the family. How must Adam feel. Damn.", "YTA you\u2019ve put your daughter in a very difficult position asking her to lie to Adam. Steve needs to step up but why would he when he can mooch off of your daughter and now Adam. This will blow up in your face and you\u2019re all going to end up homeless", "YTA You should've housed your daughter but not Steve. You mentioned \"Neither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well\" but I'd reckon being such a bum that he nearly makes your daughter homeless isn't treating her well. From what you said Steve need to sort out his priorities and stop with the \"woe is me, it's all corporate Amercias fault.\" Its a pretty pathetic stance for a grown man with a wife to hold.", "YTA\n\nFor the privilege of living essentially for free in a new, custom home, you made an agreement. You broke that agreement, which nullifies the deal. Plus, you did it in a deceptive way, and on top of that, got your younger daughter to deceive her fianc\u00e9. Since you broke the deal, Adam has every right to change the deal, and charge you market rate rent or even evict you. \n\nAnd if this stunt of yours causes a rift between Adam and your daughter and he breaks it off for her and your dishonesty, there is no reason for him to treat you like family. You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to help your daughter, but you are an asshole for your dishonest and manipulative behavior. There are other ways you could have helped besides having them move in. You could have helped with the rent for a month while Steve gets another job, since you have very little expenses. They still have her income, and he only worked part time, so they probably didn\u2019t really need that much to get by for a month. Everyone is hiring!", "YTA, the home isn\u2019t your home you are renting, you don\u2019t have the ethical or legal right to make that call.  Secondly your son basically gave you something for free and in return asked you one thing.  You screwed up the one simple thing", "YTA. All the lead in about what they do for a living was meaningless. You made a deal with a very specific requirement, and you couldn't keep it. You will get found out, and evicted.", "YTA\n\nAdam is doing you a favor because they could\u2019ve thrown you into a senior community home instead. You are taking advantage of Adam\u2019s kindness and jeopardizing your daughter\u2019s relationship with him by having her cover for your lying. Steve needs to get a full time job to support his family and help put a roof over their heads. You shouldn\u2019t be happy that your daughter is with a bum who isn\u2019t financially responsible because that\u2019s what Steve seems to be.\n\nEdit: Your younger daughter really shouldn\u2019t have to do this. Mom need to put her big girl pants on and tell Adam instead of putting her child in situation that could cost her her future husband. Guess what will happen when he does find out The wedding will be called off and all of you will be living on the streets.", "YTA - Congratulations, you put your younger daughter into a very difficult situation. She now has to lie to her fiance/husband every day. The problem isn't that you helped your older daughter but you going behind your other daughter's back. You guys could at least try and pay utility bills. I wonder if Steve still holds on to his opinions next time they all meet - which btw will be wonderful.", "YTA - Besides breaking an agreement and being dishonest, you now have squatters in your home that Adam will eventually need to evict, thus destroying your family.", "YTA and now you have made your youngest daughter TA too. This might end up ending their engagement. Adam is being incredibly generous to you without even being family yet and you are going behind his back and abusing his trust. This is wrong on so many levels. If Adam finds out he won't be able to trust you again and might not be able to trust his fianc\u00e9 again either. This will also drastically increase the void between Adam and Steve.\n\nHonestly Adam seems to be right on the mark with his views on Steve. Steve and your eldest daughter need to grow up and make things right with Adam and your youngest daughter. They also hereby loose the right to talk shit about the fact Adam is doing well, because if it weren't for that all 3 of you would now most likely be homeless.\n\nPlease reconsider and don't dig the whole you've gotten yourselves in any deeper.", "This have to be the worst mom ever now she wants her youngest daughter to lie to her husband because she is not happy about the one rule the husband set up for living in the house for free\n\nIf the daughter a seeing this your mom does not have your best interest in heart ( knowing or unknowing) do not bestray your husband for this", "YTA you got a free house with the agreement no one else\u2026 THEY BUILT IT FOR YOU, and it is theirs they are letting you live there but nooo you have 2 daughters, one who gave you the house and your favorite. Glad you\u2019re still showing who your favorites are. If your oldest ms husband was a decent man he would look for actual work and not make your daughter struggle.", "This situation isn't complicated in the least. You were given an incredibly generous break that can with only 1 string attached, and you responded by going behind Adam's back and moving  disrespectful and financially irresponsible into the house he was so generous with. I would be offering serious apologies,  getting them the hell out of the house immediately and hope like hell he'll be willing to trust you again. YTA", "So let me get this straight. Steve called Adam a corporate shill but has no problem freeloading off the money Adam makes as \u201ca corporate shill.\u201d Furthermore, your daughter and Steve have run through all of their savings which means one of two things: there was very little in savings which was incredibly unwise, especially since Steve only worked full time, or, Steve has been out of a job for months (and not recently, which you imply) and has refused to remedy his unemployment situation. On top of all of that, you are now asking your other daughter to keep this whole situation to herself. It\u2019s going to cause major marital discord when Adam inevitably finds out and you might just find *yourself* homeless. YTA.", "It's a soft YTA from me.    As a parent you can't watch your daughter go homeless, but you have been given a great and incredibly generous opportunity with one condition, and you broke that condition.    Steve has no respect for Adam, yet is happy to live off his hard work.\n\nWhat is worse though is now you are dragging your youngest into your lies and putting her relationship at risk.  What happens if Adam finds out?  How will that effect her marriage?\n\nIf i was you i'd tell your youngest that you don't want to put her in a bad position and to allow her to tell Adam but ask that she convince him to let Steve stay for the agreed period.   It's a risky strategy as we don't know how Adam will react, but it's honest and doesn't put your daughter in a bad position.", "I don't know if you'll ever see this, but you are seriously endangering your daughter's potential marriage and your own housing by lying to Adam.  Regardless of the morality of Steve's/Adam's viewpoints, you do not own the house in which you live.  Your daughter is only a fiance, not a wife.  \n\nThere is a very strong possibility that if Adam finds out what you've all done:\n\n1. He will end his engagement with your younger daughter\n2. He will evict you, your older daughter, and Steve\n3. He has no legal obligation to house any of you or make your lives easier once he finds out that you don't respect him\n\nWhy are you lying to the person whose generosity keeps you off the street?  Are you all just spectacularly stupid?  Short-sighted to the point of delusion?  This is a \\*dangerous\\* game you are all playing, and it will not end well.", "Yeah YTA. Majorly. The bum your oldest is married to can EASILY find another part-time job so he can \u201cenjoy his free time with your daughter\u201d (insert HUGE eye-roll emoji here) at the drop of a hat. Why isn\u2019t he doing door dash? Why isn\u2019t he working at a grocery store? Why isn\u2019t he manning a gas station? If he really wanted to be working, he would be. Truth is, he just doesn\u2019t want to pull his own weight, and you\u2019re enabling this behavior. For shame. Even worse, you\u2019re forcing your younger daughter to foot their bill!! Again, for shame!", "The situation isn't complicated at all.  Steve and your eldest spent what they made, didn't save for a rainy day, and are now facing the consequences of those decisions.  Adam and your youngest made decisions that allow them to save money, and house you for free.  Adam set one condition on housing you for free, and you have so little respect for him and what he does for you that you ignored it.  You have violated his trust, and now you are asking your daughter to hide that from him, meaning she will also be violating his trust.\n\nWhen Adam finds out, this is going to be very hard for him to come back from and ever trust you, or your daughter, again.  Don't be surprised if this destroys their relationship and you *all* end up out on the street.", "YTA - you or your eldest daughter and her husband should have called your youngest daughter and her husband and asked permission. \n\nIf Steve worked a minimum of 30 hours a week he should be eligible for unemployment which would along with his wife\u2019s salary be something towards continuing to live by themselves. \n\nWhen my husband was laid off about a decade ago, we immediately adjusted our lives and cut out all things that weren\u2019t essential. Any charities we had donated to were eliminated as charity does begin at home, we dropped all memberships along with streaming TV packages like Starz etc. we stopped going out to eat twice a month as a couple and I brought my own lunch to work. Meanwhile my husband took every part time job he could which in his area of work were usually contract jobs for a specific amount of time. This allowed him to stretch his unemployment since basically he would go off of it for a three month job and go back on when that ended. I don\u2019t know what your oldest and her husband did but it seems they did not know how to live on a budget. My husband was older and finally did find another permanent job where they valued his knowledge and experience. Most other jobs said he was over qualified even though he was willing to take huge pay cuts.\n\nThe whole story reminds me of the grasshopper and the ant story. \n\nAdam should know all of this as one day it will come out and then he will feel betrayed. \n\nSteve should he find a job again should work full time and save money for the proverbial rainy day.", "I have trouble believing what an AH OP is. She's forcing her younger daughter to lie to her husband to cover for her selfish older daughter and husband, which may very well lead to marital troubles. Good job, OP, on raising your older daughter to be as much of a jerk as you are.", "YTA\n\nYou tried to persuade your youngest not to tell her husband who owns, pays for and takes care of the house you are living in. Your name isn't even on the title I'm guessing. Which means the rules he has in place are because ITS HIS FUCKING HOUSE.\n\n\"I laid bare my soul\" ma'am no. You manipulated your daughter to keep her mouth shut and not tell her husband. Tough love comes in all forms. Adam is setting up an amazing life it seems and seems to have things taken care of so he can retire earlier. Steven seems like a freeloader who literally blows his money before it even meets his wallet. Next time this happens - and there will be a next time - tell them so sorry but they're grown adults and should have saved their money for rent, not blow it on stupid shit. They're going to be working until past retirement age at this point.\n\nTell Adam and I sincerely hope he can forgive you or else - looks like he can just rent out this house and make more money! I bet it's beautiful too. Someone will snatch it up quick.", "You have put your daughter in an incredibly difficult situation and have put her engagement at risk. Your daughter has some blame as well, as she should not have agreed to lie to Adam.\n\nDon't kid yourself. Adam will find out about this. It might not be today, tomorrow, or even this month, but someone will slip up and reveal the lie. It will cause major problems for you and their relationship. It would not surprise me if Adam leaves your daughter at that point.\n\nYTA for putting your daughter in this position.\n\nEdit: What happens in 6 months/1 year/etc..... when this happens again and Steve/Your other daughter need a place to live again?", "I\u2019ve read the edits and I have to go with ESH but Adam. I get it, and I\u2019m not saying I would definitely do different, but now you have your daughter lying to her husband out of guilt.

This is really wrong behavior on you, both your daughters, and Steve\u2019s end.", "YTA\n\nEven after the EDIT. You're an AH and so are your daughters. I hope Adam finds out, divorces your daughter,  and kicks you all out for your deceptions.", "YTA - So can you afford your own apartment with your homeless daughter that is no where near as nice? Because that's likely going to be the consequences of your actions. \n\nSteve insults Adam for his financial success but has no problem living in his house rent free.  Bit hypocritical. \n\nIt's nice to want to spend time with your family but an emergency fund is necessity.   Steve is going to keep repeating this scenario of being on the verge of being homeless until he grows up and figures how to balance what he wants to do with what he needs to do.  It's called being an adult.", "YTA. I understand that you want to look out for your children, but you are actively enabling your daughter's abuser here. If your SIL doesn't think employment is important, then he shouldn't be trying to benefit from other people's employment either. They've been doing fine on their own, and suddenly, you get a house, and they want to move in? He's taking advantage of your daughter, you and your other daughter, and SIL.

Adam would probably much rather do that then roll the dice on having to evict his BIL and SIL 3 months down the road when they have another sob story.", "Reading the edits OP was going to let Steve and her daughter live with her 6 months. Like no way in hell were they not going to find out via utility bill increases or just a slip in the conversation", "Yup and now the youngest is lying to her fianc\u00e9 for her mother.", "Yeah she noticed it had gone up and called her mum to ask. She's agreed to say nothing for now and is even paying the difference to hide it from Adam. But she's also taking a HUGE risk in doing this without his knowing. So now she's also risking it all for these pair of losers. Great mum and sister, they truly are. But Adam knew this would happen. I get why she's trying to protect her mum but she shouldn't be helping them. Mum wanted to give them six months but daughter said no, three months max.

It would have been such a random stipulation in any other context, but Steven signaled loud and clear this was a possibility.", "He may have, but it\u2019s usually standard for legal and insurance reasons. \n\nAlso, he could have been looking out for her against older guys who prey on older single ladies. I had a similar issue with my grandma. My grandpa passed away and a year later this older guy had moved in and basically taken over the home.

They're not even married and she's lying to him.", "that was my first thought.  \n\n\nAdam gonna find out when he, as the legal owner/landlord, finds out.  No way he doesn't.  They'll visit at some point.  \n\n\nThis is just the beginning of what will be a huge mess.  If I were Adam, this is a huge breach of trust and might be a marriage ender.  Momma and both sisters done messed up.", "To begin with I assumed Steve was a very well off trust fund kid or something. But now it seems like he just lived like one instead. Seems like both he and the daughter are pretty irresponsible and Adam knows it. While both aren't perfect at least Adams providing for his family and himself probably setting himself up for a very early retirement.", "I cannot stand this mentality. My mother is like this. She never thought money was very important and didn't bother working really. She just wanted to sit around all day and do nothing and relax, and she would tell me she didn't really care to go out there and make anything because \"money isn't everything\".  \n\nI worked damn hard, despite being very sick (kidney failure for almost 20 years of my life and a decade and a half on dialysis) and my partner did too, and together we are able to afford to rent a townhouse for us and his daughter half the week. I live in BC so it's ridiculously priced here. \n\nCue my mom who had stopped paying her mortgage because she couldn't afford it, then decided to offer it to the first person who walked by for $30,000. It was worth $100,000 (it was a run down trailer but still).\n\nNone of us knew about this before it was too late. So now she lives with me. In a tiny bedroom that we were using for a multitude of things. She won't make ANY effort whatsoever, like for fucks sake if she just filled out paperwork for pension she could earn an extra $700 a month (I think).\n\nI love her, but it's been a year and it's coming in between my relationship (zero privacy), and did I forget to mention that her cat is destroying our house? Also she is a hoarder and there is her shit everywhere. \n\nThis \"money isn't important\" attitude is selfish, in a way. \n\nThe worst part is that my grandmother is a millionaire but she won't ask her for any help. She doesn't want to take advantage of her. Of her own mother.
