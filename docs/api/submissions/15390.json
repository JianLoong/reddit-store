Unfortunately, they are both non-verbal and require assistance at night as they are prone to accidents/bed-wetting if they aren't woken up at least once in the night to go potty.\n\nMy eldest daughter (14) - let's call her Sadie, is responsible for waking them both at night to go potty. When she was younger she did this without complaint as she knew I was unable to (I need my sleep as I drive a schoolbus in the mornings and take my job seriously). My ex isnt in the picture so it's just me and my four children.\n\nLately Sadie has been complaining and unwilling to wake the boys up and is even upset at sharing a room. She doesnt understand that her older brother (16 and lets call him Aaron) has his own room as I find it inappropriate for all three boys to share, and that unfortunately in our current economic position we cannot afford to move to a home with enough rooms for everyone.\n\nAnyways this has been an ongoing battle for some time now and apparently Sadie messed up one night and did not wake up the boys which led to Ryan having a huge accident and pretty much ruining his mattress.\n\nI have to wait until payday and since I can not trust Ryan on the couch I asked Sadie to give her bed until I buy him a new mattress.\n\n...big mistake Sadie has thrown a massive tantrum stating that she hates having to clean up after the boys when they go potty and that she is too tired in school from waking up at night. She also said some hurtful things about my favoring Aaron as he does not do anything potty related.\n\nThe thing is that Aaron has a part-time job and helps with the bills and he makes sure the boys are on the bus. So if it isn't favoritism, she is just better suited for the more sensitive stuff. \n\nHere is where I might have been the a-hole: I told her that she did not have a choice and that family sticks together and that we are all making sacrifices.\n\nSadie has been sullen ever since, and it's been making me think that perhaps I am in the wrong.

It\u2019s inappropriate for your 16 year old to share a room with his brothers but it\u2019s ok for your 14 year old daughter to share a room with her younger brothers. Your daughter is right.

You are showing favoritism toward your boys. Just because Sadie is a girl doesn't mean she should be responsible for caring for her younger brothers. She shouldn't be waking them, she shouldn't be cleaning up after them. Your oldest should share a room with his younger brothers and Sadie should get her own room. At these ages, it would be far more appropriate for Aaron to help his brothers.

How is that your needing sleep is more important than hers. As in rotating waking them up with every abled body there. You, Aaron and Sadie. Sadie is the one who should have her own room as a growing teenager. The boys should share a room. I am on Sadie\u2019s side here.

No precautions were done to prevent a mattress from being ruined.", "Yta.... omg i was a 14 yr old who only had to deal with siblings climbing in my bed every night and it destroyed me.  Mental health issues,  health problems etc as a parent you just can't do this to your kids.  There are ways to clean a wet mattress, google it.  Honestly, talk to the Dr.  Find answers.  Your 14 yr old daughter should absolutely not be taking her brothers to the toilet.  Just can't believe you're destroying her life like that. Take turns if nothing else.

Unfortunately, they are both non-verbal and require assistance at night as they are prone to accidents/bed-wetting if they aren't woken up at least once in the night to go potty.\n\nMy eldest daughter (14) - let's call her Sadie, is responsible for waking them both at night to go potty. When she was younger she did this without complaint as she knew I was unable to (I need my sleep as I drive a schoolbus in the mornings and take my job seriously). My ex isnt in the picture so it's just me and my four children.\n\nLately Sadie has been complaining and unwilling to wake the boys up and is even upset at sharing a room. She doesnt understand that her older brother (16 and lets call him Aaron) has his own room as I find it inappropriate for all three boys to share, and that unfortunately in our current economic position we cannot afford to move to a home with enough rooms for everyone.\n\nAnyways this has been an ongoing battle for some time now and apparently Sadie messed up one night and did not wake up the boys which led to Ryan having a huge accident and pretty much ruining his mattress.\n\nI have to wait until payday and since I can not trust Ryan on the couch I asked Sadie to give her bed until I buy him a new mattress.\n\n...big mistake Sadie has thrown a massive tantrum stating that she hates having to clean up after the boys when they go potty and that she is too tired in school from waking up at night. She also said some hurtful things about my favoring Aaron as he does not do anything potty related.\n\nThe thing is that Aaron has a part-time job and helps with the bills and he makes sure the boys are on the bus. So if it isn't favoritism, she is just better suited for the more sensitive stuff. \n\nHere is where I might have been the a-hole: I told her that she did not have a choice and that family sticks together and that we are all making sacrifices.\n\nSadie has been sullen ever since, and it's been making me think that perhaps I am in the wrong.

A good strategy could also be to limit fluid consumption a few hours before bed.

I understand that your situation is challenging and you need help, but your daughter needs to sleep and having to wake up twice a night every single night is terrible for her health and mental development. The fact that she was severely punished after failing to wake them up one time means she hasn\u2019t gotten a good nights sleep in YEARS. There has to be a better way (another commenter suggested diapers, and a $50 mattress protector will save a mattress from any amount of bed wetting) that allows all family members to sleep through the night. \n\nIn families with special needs children there is often a tendency to expect too much of your non-disabled children.

She\u2019s not old enough to be a caregiver and shouldn\u2019t be forced to give up her own childhood. \n\nAlso, if the younger boys must be woken up every night, why is only Sadie responsible for it? Why can\u2019t the older son come in and wake them up some nights? Why can\u2019t you?

You need your sleep for work, but your daughter doesn't need her sleep for school? Your son, he needs his sleep for work too. So basically, your daughter gets to do YOUR job taking care of YOUR kids because she doesn't have a job? The only child you care about making sure gets a good night's sleep is your son with a job. Missing sleep is ruining your daughters development and mental health, but whatever because she doesn't have a paycheck.\n\nYeah. Your daughter is going to hate ALL of her brothers and you too, and when she runs as far and fast as she can, who will care for your kids for you then? Might as well figure it out and start now. Stop making your CHILD being a parent to your children. She didn't have them. It's not ok that a teen girl is forced to share a room with her brothers, it's not ok that she is being expected to do your parenting for you because you are failing at it, and it's not ok for you to take her bed for your failure to parent. If I were her, I would sleep on the couch, refuse to wake up, and let the boys ruin that mattress too. Then where will they sleep? The floor? You won't kick her off the couch so the boys sleep on it because you like to sit on it, so at least she would have one reliable place to sleep.\n\nIf money is so tight, why on earth did you throw away a mattress because of urine? If you don't have your kids that pee the bed in diapers and have a plastic mattress cover, that is poor planning on your part. There are also absorbant bed pads used with elder care. It's much cheaper to rent an upholstery cleaner and then let the mattress air dry in the sun after cleaning than to throw it away and buy another one. Deciding not to spend a little to avoid spending a lot is your bad choice and not your daughters. You decided not to protect the mattress or clean it. So maybe you should give your boys YOUR mattress. While you're at it, you can move them out of your teenage daughters bedroom because it's inappropriate for boys and girls to share a room at this age.\n\nBy the way, I don't know where the other parent is in all of this but your daughter is the age where she can most definitely tell a judge she doesn't want to live with you.

I know it\u2019s hard to be a single parent and care for 4 children. Especially if two have autism and are non verbal. I know there are more challenges to them than just bed wetting. Why I know that? \nI work at a home for children with non verbal autism. They are sent to us because they\u2019re harder to care for. Pee and Poo is almost daily. They want their routines and have breakdowns if not. \n\nHave you ever considered for your daughter and yourself that maybe having your sons sent at a home like this? I know it might be a very hard decision but in the end I think you all could benefit. Your daughter deserves her own life. You deserve someone to help you out and especially your boys deserve to get help and learn skills. Did you know they can communicate via Pictures? These kids are smart as heck. And we treat our non verbal kiddos as if they were our own family. You could always visit them or bring them back to your place for a few nights. It\u2019s supposed to be a relief for you. I\u2019d heavily think about this possibility and you can always ask me for more information or maybe advise. \n\nAlso about the mattress, we use the ones that are not made out of fabric. But a sort out of plastic? You just have to give them a bedding - they\u2019re still soft (I slept in them to try out). It\u2019s perfect for accidents. You could just desinfect them the next day. I send our boys to potty shortly before they fall asleep. And in the morning I check in really often to get them before they\u2019re fully awake. Once they\u2019re in a drowsy state they go to potty. It works well. Otherwise they\u2019d always have accidents. I mean some still do, some almost daily, but it works.\n\nI know how lovable these kids can be and they\u2019re special in their own way. We wouldn\u2019t want to change our kids in the slightest, but we KNOW it\u2019s  a challenge. Especially if you care 24 hours for them. We need breaks from our kids too. Please consider getting help. The parents of our kids have got their life back while they still frequently see and pick up their kids.", "Exactly this! If the excuse for Aron not contributing to the potty chore is that he has a part time job then: what was his contribution to this before he had a job - since Sadie had been doing this chore for years and the boys aren\u2019t much younger than her.

At 14, she's still growing, and her lack of sleep is going to affect her school work. She shouldn't have to give up her bed and play mommy to her younger brothers to accommodate her male family members. \n\nHonestly, what OP's doing is very much a form of child abuse, and should be reported to CPS.", "Agreed! I was also confused how these boys are messing up a mattress so badly when there is a very simple solution - a mattress pad.

There could be other solutions. Hell, I can't drink water within a few hours before I go to sleep, or I am up all night in the bathroom (post 40 lady problems yay). \n\nNo way should the daughter be the only one responsible for waking up these children to go to the bathroom, nor should she be sharing a room with them!

I understand the situation is difficult OP, but you chose to have (multiple) children, your daughter did not. I 100% agree that everyone in the home should contribute in some way, but she is a growing child and shouldn't be waking up every night to care for YOUR children.

If your current school is not paying enough to mostly live on, check around. A lot of bus lines are also hiring at really good wages. You have a needed skill, you can find better pay.\n\n2. Even with 2 other jobs, example bus hours: 6:30 am til 9:30am, then 2pm til 4pm. I'm assuming your jobs, unless working still in the school during the day, are evenings and weekends.

If you and you oldest are all working and barely making ends meet you're either living in an area way too expensive for you and you should find some outskirts to move to, or your other jobs are not paying you enough.

Maybe OP should look into how much a night nanny and a laundry service would cost and get a little perspective about how much her daughter contributes to the family.", "Exactly! Technically speaking, Sadie is also contributing financially because if it wasn\u2019t for her, OP and Aaron wouldn\u2019t be well rested enough to go to work. Not to mention, Sadie is a 14 year old! No 14 year old girl should have to contribute financially to have the right to not have to share a room with her brothers, especially as there is a room to avoid such an inappropriate situation. Can\u2019t believe OP thinks brothers sharing a room is inappropriate but thinks it\u2019s okay for a 14 year old female going through puberty to share with boys.

It's baffling to me that OP thinks it's inappropriate for the 16-year-old boy to share a room with the two boys, yet thinks it's perfectly appropriate for the 14-year-old girl to do so.

The excuse for this is that he has a part time job and the daughter is \u2018more suited to these sensitive matters\u2019, which is hypocritical and sexist. The 14 year old doesn\u2019t have a choice of getting a job yet, doesn\u2019t sound like the eldest took part in the potty chore before he got a job, who is going to take on that responsibility when the 14 year old gets a part time job as well? \n\nTHEN you add to that removing a child from their bed because apparently OP didn\u2019t plan on getting good mattress protectors.

She's a single parent.", "The family is already broken\n\nSadie is going to book it the moment she can", "Was it the 14yo's choice to have kids?\nAlso, apparently ruining the daughter's sleep which can affect her education and growth is somehow better than ruining the adult's sleep.\n\nShe shouldn't be responsible for any help in raising the kids", "Dude, 14 year olds anf younger cannot be expected to wake up their younger brothers every night to make them go potty. Sadie is now saying it's affecting her school performance, which I believe 100%. This is way beyond her responsibity as a sister, especially since she's a minor.\n\nOP should be waking the boys up. We've all been there, we all take our jobs seriously. It sucks but it's the parent's responsibility.", "She\u2019s 14 and shouldn\u2019t be expected to get up every night to attend to her brothers. That\u2019s the responsibility of their parent.", "They might be able to connect her to services.", "And, as someone else astutely pointed out, this whole \u201ctaking my school bus driving job very seriously\u201d thing is complete BS unless he\u2019s driving kids on long field trips every day!", "But he didn't even do that. There is no YTA, ESH, NTA or NAH in his comment", "No it wasn't. The whole topic is almost unreal to me.", "I don't think OP sees any of this in her daughter's future. I think the assumption is that her whole life will be spent providing the care her brothers need through their lives.\n\nIt may not be a solidly thought out plan, but I think it's the expectation.\n\nOP will support until she can't anymore, brother will be expected to chip in some cash, but the most the daughter can hope for is to be allowed to leave the house for a few hours a week to do some menial job to bring in a few extra dollars to help cover her brothers' additional expenses.\n\nI hope that girl finds it in herself to leave and make her own life.", ">Less when you had two special needs kids\n\nThree, if you count the daughter who might eventually break down under the pressure of being a substitute parent/unpaid nanny.", "University is not the only path to a job that pays a family sustaining wage. Finishing high school though is an important first step though.", "Honestly number 2 is the only real option, they did not create these children Aaron and Sadie are not substitutes.", "Is he really being a normal teenager when he has to pay his mother's bills, though? He should spend his money on himself, not on bills.\n\nIn my opinion OP failed all of her children. The youngest two don't have a proper caretaker and God knows what will happen to them when Sadie leaves, the only girl is forced to parent her brothers and take care of the house and the oldest has to work to pay the bills. I'm curious what the **parent** does other than sleep.", "VERY good point.  Exactly!", "Daughter doesn't need an education when she's clearly meant to be a slave caring for her brothers for the rest of her life.\n\nI can only hope when she escapes this situation it isn't to another abuser.", "But, but OP can't do that because OP needs their sleep because they have a job, besides \"Sadie\" is prime \"mummy\" material because of her genitalia, so of course she MUST do the parenting!  /s", "Thanks. Edited now", "OP also needs to get Sadie out of that room and into her own, the older boy needs to swap with Sadie as its highly inappropriate for a teenage girl to be sharing a room with male siblings.  OP's mindset is way-outta-whack.\n\nCan see Sadie going NC as soon as she's able to book it outta there, poor girl.  My heart goes out to Sadie.\n\nOP you're TA.", "And? That\u2019s not an excuse to make her daughter responsible for her brothers.", "She is failing her daughter. Her daughter is struggling in school because she\u2019s too tired being a parent to her siblings. If OP is too tired to drive a school bus on the morning while dealing with her sons nighttime potty needs how is her daughter supposed to cope as a teenager?", "OP is punishing her daughter simply because she's a girl.", "Thank you, How in Hades is it inappropriate for 3 boys to share a room, but a teen girl and 2 boy is fine and dandy? A teen girl needs privacy and a modicum of decency far more than a boy. (Saying this as an adult male) The path before her daughter is grim at this point.", "The only part I don't agree is with the girl sharing a room with the other boys, not the other older kid. Everything else I guess we'll only know for sure when we live a situation like OPs. 4 kids out of which 2 are special needs, a single parent and a job that I don't think pays very well... My respect to OP even when he's not doing it perfectly.", "Then your previous comment isn't relevant, is it?\n\nBut yeah, top level comments should have official judgements.", "Yeah she\u2019s saying she\u2019s prepared to because she doesn\u2019t plan to be around", "Lol. Just wait 2 years when Aaron leaves the house first. He seems to get it nice from the post but something tells me that his life isn't all rainbows...", "I mean, if you have four kids and are happy to make your living as a school bus driver and force your 16 year old to help with the bills rather than getting something with more hours, you probably don\u2019t have high aspirations for your live in nurse daughters future.", "Get bed covers or maybe just make them wear dispoaable diapers throughout the night so no one has to wake up.", "So you think it\u2019s ok for a 14 year old girl to have to wake up every night to take her brothers to the toilet? \n\nIt\u2019s affecting her schoolwork, how can u possibly think this is ok?", "If you can\u2019t afford to have kids then don\u2019t have kids. If you have 1 autistic kid and you\u2019re unable to parent them and parentify your other kids then DO. NOT. HAVE. ANOTHER. KID. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nOp, YTA, that poor girl needs a mother she doesn\u2019t need being a mother to her brothers.", "It is, because he judges her without giving any advise aka isn't walking in Op's shoes, but thinks he knows everything", "I wanna scoop this poor girl up and invite her to come live with me and enjoy what little bit of being a child/ teen she has left. The fact it's expected of her to have no life aspirations and to stay at home for the rest of her life to be a carer for her brothers... You should be ashamed as a Mother that, that is the expectation you have for her future. Plus you take away one of the only spots she has of her own - her mattress! How about you do your damn job as a mother, get you damn favorite son to contribute more to the household too. Oh and give you teen DAUGHTER some damn privacy!"]}
