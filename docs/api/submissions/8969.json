She wasn\u2019t severely injured, just some cuts and a sprained wrist, but it was obviously very scary for her (she was the one driving and there was nobody else in the car). After that, she developed an intense fear of cars and driving that extended to others as well. She started having to take public transit to school, and every time one of my parents needed to use a car for anything (grocery shopping, appointments, etc), she would start sobbing and begging them not to get in a car because she was scared they would get hurt. Eventually, my parents also stopped driving and would just do everything virtually or get food delivered (they both worked from home, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal). \n\nAt the time, I was a freshman in college, and I really wanted my family to attend my first big theater performance of the year. However, my college is several hours away and it\u2019s pretty difficult to get to using public transportation, so my parents were planning to use a car to get there. However, my sister obviously refused to go because of the car fear (which was understandable). But, about a week before the performance, my parents informed me that they would no longer be attending the performance either because my sister would scream and cry every time they brought it up. They said there would be other performances so it didn\u2019t matter that they wouldn\u2019t go to this one. \n\nI was pretty upset because it was my first leading role and they had promised they\u2019d be there to support me. I tried to find ways they could come using public transit, but the logistics were just too difficult, so I eventually just started begging them to use the car to come and that it was really important to me. They got upset with me and said I wasn\u2019t being understanding of my sister\u2019s trauma and that I was being selfish. At that point I just gave up, but even now (years later) they still bring it up and talk about how awful I was to them. So was I really TA?\n\nETA: The performance was several months after the accident had happened.", "created_utc": 1675367271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ryx8g/aita_for_not_being_understanding_of_my_sisters/", "score": 322, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd started driving lessons (but had to quit for health reasons) about a year or 2 after my accident and I actually made the choice to drive down the road where my accident happened so I could go there, be safe and take control of the situation and empower myself.

Your family participating in the avoidance for so long likely made it harder to recover. \n\nThey probably didn\u2019t know better - im sure everyone was shaken up and doing the best they could. but they should now do some learning.
