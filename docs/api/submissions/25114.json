The day of????\n\nAnyway, I only tell someone a gift if it's something they  eed to prepare for, like a night away or something. But usually I'll make that for after the birthday, and give the itinerary on the day.\n\nReason? Because shit like this happens. You raise someone's expectations, and drop them last minute.

Overall it sounds like you have great parents that actually care about your birthday. Some people don't even get offered the cake, let alone the expensive phone.\n\nOf course, you're still a kid so don't be hard on yourself for the reaction- but it would be a mature and pleasant thing to recognize the misbehavior and fix the situation with your parents. Rather than focusing on your disappointment, just consider that your parents have been working to save money for your birthday in the first place- that's kind of special and not as common as you might think. Have cake with them and enjoy your birthday. A loving family > stuff.", "NAH", "NAH\nYou\u2019re right to feel disappointed. Emergencies happen and your parents had to use the money for the laptop. You should talk with them though. \n\nAs you are in your late teens it might be a good time to get a part time job job so you can save up to buy your own phone.", "You are kinda the AH  but i kinda get it. I get being upset, but try to be gracious about it if you can. You might regret it later if you don't. I have had this same disappointment myself. A rich friend gave us kids money to go to six flags, because we were poor, but my parents took that money and bought themselves a VCR (this was back in the 80s), that went into their bedroom so we could not even use it. I was bitter for years. I was essentially no worse off than before, nothing was actually taken away from me but it still hurt. But the worst was knowing about it and having it snatched away. There is nothing to do for it except to try to accept it without blame or bitterness because it hurts way less when you can do that. It's not an easy skill to learn but once you do, it will help you for the rest of your life.", "It\u2019s just as well. You\u2019re too old for a mobile anyway.", "ESH - Yeah it was a shitty move on the parents but it was an emergency and sometimes you to wait for when that happens.", "YTA. Your 17 not a child, you'll get the phone sooner or later, through your own money if not that of your parents. If you were 13 or younger I would understand, but a 17 year old should be more understanding of what an emergency is like.", "YTA.   \n\n\nIt's natural to feel disappointment about not getting something you were promised, but your reaction was over the top. I assume this happened because your parents aren't dripping with money. What were they supposed to do when they didn't have money for both your expensive birthday present and your brother's need for a working laptop? They didn't do this to spite you.  \n\n\nYou should apologize to your parents about your reaction and see if they can save up for the mobile they promised you again.", "NTA\n\nWhat they did was shitty, selfish and I'm not sure if they are being honest.  \n\nWhat parents wait until the day before your birthday to purchase a specific phone for their child?  What if the store is sold out or doesn't have the correct color? Also, phones fluctuate in price quite frequently  with sales and new releases.  Waiting until the last minute means you'd have no choice in the price you pay and increases the likelihood you might not be able to get the desired phone.  \n\nDo you know your brother's laptop is actually broken?  This is eerily similar to the shit my best friend's parents did to her.  They would tell her they were going to make these great plans, or get her something wonderful and she would be over the moon happy anticipating what was to come.  Her parents would enjoy her happy demeanor and then almost always, something would come up last minute to prevent the plans and she was told it was just unavoidable.  Maybe OPs parents just aren't planners and aren't lying assholes.  However, my kid is 14 and there is no way I'd tell him what his birthday present was and no way I'd wait until the day before to buy him a specific phone.  Especially since COVID with all the supply chain issues.", "Yta.   How do you refuse not getting a gift?  You can't force them to give you a gift even if it was promised.  Life is always changing and you need to learn to be adaptable, because this is not the last time you will be disappointed about something after getting your hopes up.  I mean, if this is the only time it ever happens, then you will live the greatest life ever.  If your parents are strapped for cash I can't imagine it was easy for them to have to go back on their promise, I'm sure they were disappointed too and you make them feel like shit for making a tough but necessary decision.  What's wrong with a less expensive mobile?  You didn't mention the price, but they go from $30 to $2000, so just because you want a specific model makes you entitled unless you pay for it yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are a complex rush of chemicals triggered by both internal and external stimuli.\n\nShe's not being rude, she's not being disrespectful, she's not making demands- she's just no longer in the mood to celebrate. Sometimes it takes people more than a day or two to get their feet under them emotionally after having the rug pulled out from under them. Sometimes, when someone gets dealt a shit hand, they're no longer in the mood to eat and that's normal.\n\nI'm sure OP would have been in the mood to celebrate if they had been told a week or two before- but, well, shit happens. It's just unfortunate that in the process of helping her brother her parents inadvertently left OP holding said shit.", "That he needs to get a job? Working part-time can be as little as a shift or two a week and it would have allowed him to build up enough money to repair his own laptop. He could opt for an apprenticeship over university and be paid to learn. He has adult options, it\u2019s not too much to ask that he exercise adult responsibility for the tools he needs for his chosen pathway.", "I\u2019m not upset with op for being disappointed. I 100 percent understand how she is upset and it\u2019s a justifiable feeling. I just really don\u2019t understand why the parents had to tell her she was going to get a phone but not just go get it. I don\u2019t understand the point of that. I also keep going back to a post I read about someone else who would tell the person about all the awesome gifts but never get them. Just buy it and then give it to them. Not sure why I was getting downvoted for saying that.", "You are certainly not an AH for your disappointment.  As a daughter with two brothers, I would watch your parents' behavior to see if this is a constant behavior, prioritizing your brother.  Do you plan on attending a University when you are old enough?  Will there be funds for a laptop for you?  Start watching for your own well being.  My parents prioritized my brother's education over mine, so I know of what I speak.  kt", "Aren't you trying to guilt them by being a brat? You can't always get what you want. Sometimes you can't even get what you need. Did you really need that phone, perhaps your brother needs the laptop more.", "NTA\nIt us normal do be upset when you don't get something you were expecting. You should talk to your parents, say something along the lines of:\n\"I'm not mad at you, I understand the decision you made, to prioritise education over luxury. I'm just disapointed that things didn't turn out the way I wanted and I need some time to myself to work through it.", "Nta, but what i really wanna know is why cant ur brother repair his own computer. He is a fucking adult, he can deal with his own needs", "YTA. Sorry. You are being a brat. I get the disappointment but your brother needs his laptop for school. Your fancy mobile will have to wait. Life is like that sometimes. Your parents are doing their best.", "Have you ever had the experience of wanting to buy something for someone you love or take that person to a nice place, but suddenly the car broke down, there is a medical bill or an urgent repair? Parents can't magically make money appear.  \n\n\nThose are unforeseen expenses, only someone privileged would be unable to understand it.", "awww what a nice memory", "because as seen from the post, it was a very expensive gift which they were themselves thought of buying for OP.OP never mentioned she asked for a phone it was the parents who thought about gifting herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny responsible parent would ask the child before buying such an expensive gift incase she doesnt want it or wants something else. And we know OP are not well of, so the parents telling OP before is completely reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Getting computer fixed for uni is far more important than getting a gift. As one is a neccessity and one is a luxury. \n\nNAH"]}
