They said that they can give another gift for my birthday but I refused and went to my room and later I told them that I don't want a birthday cake , i will just go out with my friends .   \nthe thing is I got my hopes high and now  I am feeling disappointment , I am not trying to be bratty but I am just sad .

The long term consequences of a non working laptop is greater than the short term disappointment of waiting longer for a new mobile.", "It sucks but shit happens. NAH, I\u2019m sure your parents aren\u2019t happy about it either.", "Unfortunately this is just a shitty situation\n\nIt\u2019s very understandable that you\u2019re upset, but when financial emergencies pop up, sometimes the budget for other things does go down.\n\nMaybe try to talk to your parents to see if you can work toward getting a cell phone as a late birthday gift, if they don\u2019t have the budget right now. If you explain that you understand why this happened but that you were just upset, they might be more understanding. \n\nI do hope that if the roles were inversed here and it was your broken uni laptop versus your brother\u2019s new phone they would still prioritize the essentials.\n\nIf you keep the attitude up long-term YTA, but having an initial emotional reaction is very forgivable and understandable.", "NTA\n\nYes, laptop is more important at the moment. But your parents should promise to buy you a mobile when they save more money.", "NAH \nI am sorry, I can understant that you feel deeply disappointed. You are entitled to be angry, but espacially at life. Work for the Uni is important and your parents had to do this. It is still your Birthday and you can spend it how you like.", "NAH. I think the mistake was telling you a gift in advance. Also... the day before? When were they gonna buy the phone? The day of????\n\nAnyway, I only tell someone a gift if it's something they  eed to prepare for, like a night away or something. But usually I'll make that for after the birthday, and give the itinerary on the day.\n\nReason? Because shit like this happens. You raise someone's expectations, and drop them last minute. Had they have said nothing, then no one would be the wiser, and no one hurt.\n\nSo NAH, but... the parents did make an error in judgement.", "NTA. You are 17 and your parents made you a promise they most certainly should have followed thru with. Your brother is an adult. Is there a reason he couldn\u2019t pay for the repairs?\nMaybe your folks could have compromised and gotten you a less expensive phone? You have a right to feel upset.\n\nEdit to add if your parents are that strapped for cash maybe they shouldn\u2019t be making promises they can\u2019t follow through with. It just leads to hurt feelings and broken trust.", "I get being upset you have every right. However since the laptop is needed for your brothers schoolwork I get that too.\n\nDid they offer to buy you a phone in the future to make up for it? Could they have given you a cheaper phone. Did they discuss with you how they plan on giving you a phone in the near future? I guess it\u2019s time to get a job and buy your own.", "Nta", "NTA. Sorry they made a promise and have reneged on it. You have every right to be pissed off.", "Nta your parents shouldn\u2019t have told you and got your hopes up. It\u2019s okay you\u2019re disappointed. Not saying they have to buy you the phone instead of your brothers laptop but it\u2019s unfair for them to try and act like you shouldn\u2019t be upset.", "NAH, I've been in your shoes and fully understand the feeling of disappointment. Now as I get older I understand why the emergency cost was justified. Still it sucks for sure, but don't let it simmer for too long", "I won't call you a brat, because it's normal to feel disappointed about not getting a gift you've expected for so long. However, your brother's case sounds like an emergency. If you really want that phone, maybe offer a compromise of waiting a bit longer for your parents to save up money \u2013 they sound like they do care about you, but when money is tight, sometimes you have to make sacrifices.\n\nHappy late birthday, and NAH.", "Light YTA\n\nThey are dealing with the family budget, and your brothers uni classes take precedence. It's okay to be disappointed, but the spiteful reaction of not wanting to even have cake with them is immature and inconsiderate... Overall it sounds like you have great parents that actually care about your birthday. Some people don't even get offered the cake, let alone the expensive phone.\n\nOf course, you're still a kid so don't be hard on yourself for the reaction- but it would be a mature and pleasant thing to recognize the misbehavior and fix the situation with your parents. Rather than focusing on your disappointment, just consider that your parents have been working to save money for your birthday in the first place- that's kind of special and not as common as you might think. Have cake with them and enjoy your birthday. A loving family > stuff.", "NAH", "NAH\nYou\u2019re right to feel disappointed. Emergencies happen and your parents had to use the money for the laptop. You should talk with them though. \n\nAs you are in your late teens it might be a good time to get a part time job job so you can save up to buy your own phone.", "You are kinda the AH  but i kinda get it. I get being upset, but try to be gracious about it if you can. You might regret it later if you don't. I have had this same disappointment myself. A rich friend gave us kids money to go to six flags, because we were poor, but my parents took that money and bought themselves a VCR (this was back in the 80s), that went into their bedroom so we could not even use it. I was bitter for years. I was essentially no worse off than before, nothing was actually taken away from me but it still hurt. But the worst was knowing about it and having it snatched away. There is nothing to do for it except to try to accept it without blame or bitterness because it hurts way less when you can do that. It's not an easy skill to learn but once you do, it will help you for the rest of your life.", "It\u2019s just as well. You\u2019re too old for a mobile anyway.", "ESH - Yeah it was a shitty move on the parents but it was an emergency and sometimes you to wait for when that happens.", "YTA. Your 17 not a child, you'll get the phone sooner or later, through your own money if not that of your parents. If you were 13 or younger I would understand, but a 17 year old should be more understanding of what an emergency is like.", "YTA.   \n\n\nIt's natural to feel disappointment about not getting something you were promised, but your reaction was over the top. I assume this happened because your parents aren't dripping with money. What were they supposed to do when they didn't have money for both your expensive birthday present and your brother's need for a working laptop? They didn't do this to spite you.  \n\n\nYou should apologize to your parents about your reaction and see if they can save up for the mobile they promised you again.", "NTA\n\nWhat they did was shitty, selfish and I'm not sure if they are being honest.  \n\nWhat parents wait until the day before your birthday to purchase a specific phone for their child?  What if the store is sold out or doesn't have the correct color? Also, phones fluctuate in price quite frequently  with sales and new releases.  Waiting until the last minute means you'd have no choice in the price you pay and increases the likelihood you might not be able to get the desired phone.  \n\nDo you know your brother's laptop is actually broken?  This is eerily similar to the shit my best friend's parents did to her.  They would tell her they were going to make these great plans, or get her something wonderful and she would be over the moon happy anticipating what was to come.  Her parents would enjoy her happy demeanor and then almost always, something would come up last minute to prevent the plans and she was told it was just unavoidable.  Maybe OPs parents just aren't planners and aren't lying assholes.  However, my kid is 14 and there is no way I'd tell him what his birthday present was and no way I'd wait until the day before to buy him a specific phone.  Especially since COVID with all the supply chain issues.", "Yta.   How do you refuse not getting a gift?  You can't force them to give you a gift even if it was promised.  Life is always changing and you need to learn to be adaptable, because this is not the last time you will be disappointed about something after getting your hopes up.  I mean, if this is the only time it ever happens, then you will live the greatest life ever.  If your parents are strapped for cash I can't imagine it was easy for them to have to go back on their promise, I'm sure they were disappointed too and you make them feel like shit for making a tough but necessary decision.  What's wrong with a less expensive mobile?  You didn't mention the price, but they go from $30 to $2000, so just because you want a specific model makes you entitled unless you pay for it yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
