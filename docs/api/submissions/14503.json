Long time follower, first time poster.\n\nMy (29M) wife (28F) and I have been together for about 10 years (married for 2 years), and while not the most affectionate person in public, I am quite affectionate at home when it's just us. Lots of hugs/kisses/physical touching, you name it. Both our love languages is quality time and physical touch, courtesy of her research.\n\nIn the past few months, she has joined the TikTok reels and wants to copy things she sees people do/ask their SO in reels or in movies (like when guys lift your chin, or kabidona-something? against a wall, or when the girl asks something to her spouse or boyfriend). So we'll be eating dinner and I'll be on my phone/working on my laptop, and there will be something in a video she sends me or on a show/movie we're watching, and she'll comment on it as it relates to us or want me to do something to her.\n\nSo this morning, she was watching a reel in bed, and it was a man running his hand through his partner's hair. She asked me to do it, and I said no. I might have been a little frustrated cause I was running late for work, and asked her \"Why are you acting like this? We're not in a movie. Do I ask you these kinds of silly stuff?\"\n\nI could tell it made her upset and she didn't press it again, and I didn't think anything of it until later when she wasn't texting me like she usually does in the day. I text her asking her what she wants for dinner, and she said she doesn't care. And then she says she is still hurt about this morning about how I was a jerk this morning to her and invalidated how she felt.\n\nAITA for telling her that this isn't a movie, and asking her why she was behaving like this? We hug and kiss all the time, so I feel like she is copying stuff just to get a reaction from me.\n\n\n**\n\nEdit: Bought my wife a cupcake and her favorite boba, and went home after work. She arrived half an hour after me, and pouted at me when she saw my peace offerings. We hugged, and I apologized for being an ass this morning. She apologized for making me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI asked her if she wanted me to do things like that to her, and she said sometimes. But she admitted that she sometimes missed the butterflies when we first dated. (Surprise, I didn't connect the dots that one of our friends just got into a new relationship and has been over the moon about all their cute moments) So I asked her what to tell me all the \"booktoks\" things she's watched that she likes, and she shyly showed me all the ones she bookmarked.\n\nSo yeah, gonna make the lady happy and sprinkle her weeks with some. And will take into account how to keep our life ~spicy~.\n\nI love her, and for all you folks trying to hit on her, she's taken. Gtfo here.

The gentle push against a wall or the wrists above the head, the gentle titling of the chin upwards etc typically ends in kissing and tender moments.\n\nSounds like you are lacking in the romance department and she didn't know how to communicate with her words so she used visual aids thinking you'd get the hint.\n\nShe doesn't think she's in a fantasy movie.

They are pretty sweet tbh and the one girl is absolutely hysterical when she asks her WILLING partner to try them out.
