Do I ask you these kinds of silly stuff?\"\n\nI could tell it made her upset and she didn't press it again, and I didn't think anything of it until later when she wasn't texting me like she usually does in the day.

The gentle push against a wall or the wrists above the head, the gentle titling of the chin upwards etc typically ends in kissing and tender moments.\n\nSounds like you are lacking in the romance department and she didn't know how to communicate with her words so she used visual aids thinking you'd get the hint.\n\nShe doesn't think she's in a fantasy movie.
