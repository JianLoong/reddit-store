Long time follower, first time poster.\n\nMy (29M) wife (28F) and I have been together for about 10 years (married for 2 years), and while not the most affectionate person in public, I am quite affectionate at home when it's just us. Lots of hugs/kisses/physical touching, you name it. Both our love languages is quality time and physical touch, courtesy of her research.\n\nIn the past few months, she has joined the TikTok reels and wants to copy things she sees people do/ask their SO in reels or in movies (like when guys lift your chin, or kabidona-something? against a wall, or when the girl asks something to her spouse or boyfriend). So we'll be eating dinner and I'll be on my phone/working on my laptop, and there will be something in a video she sends me or on a show/movie we're watching, and she'll comment on it as it relates to us or want me to do something to her.\n\nSo this morning, she was watching a reel in bed, and it was a man running his hand through his partner's hair. She asked me to do it, and I said no. I might have been a little frustrated cause I was running late for work, and asked her \"Why are you acting like this? We're not in a movie. Do I ask you these kinds of silly stuff?\"\n\nI could tell it made her upset and she didn't press it again, and I didn't think anything of it until later when she wasn't texting me like she usually does in the day. I text her asking her what she wants for dinner, and she said she doesn't care. And then she says she is still hurt about this morning about how I was a jerk this morning to her and invalidated how she felt.\n\nAITA for telling her that this isn't a movie, and asking her why she was behaving like this? We hug and kiss all the time, so I feel like she is copying stuff just to get a reaction from me.\n\n\n**\n\nEdit: Bought my wife a cupcake and her favorite boba, and went home after work. She arrived half an hour after me, and pouted at me when she saw my peace offerings. We hugged, and I apologized for being an ass this morning. She apologized for making me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI asked her if she wanted me to do things like that to her, and she said sometimes. But she admitted that she sometimes missed the butterflies when we first dated. (Surprise, I didn't connect the dots that one of our friends just got into a new relationship and has been over the moon about all their cute moments) So I asked her what to tell me all the \"booktoks\" things she's watched that she likes, and she shyly showed me all the ones she bookmarked.\n\nSo yeah, gonna make the lady happy and sprinkle her weeks with some. And will take into account how to keep our life ~spicy~.\n\nI love her, and for all you folks trying to hit on her, she's taken. Gtfo here.

They are pretty sweet tbh and the one girl is absolutely hysterical when she asks her WILLING partner to try them out.

You have to put in the work to make a relationship stand the test of time and it might seem silly or whatever to *you*, but it is *meaningful* to her. \n\nLet this please be a lesson to you that your time is finite and there's only so many times someone will be willing to share initiate touches with them, and you were very rude about it.", "The first", "Just wondering does she want to film this as well or does she just ask you to play out her fantasies.", "Honestly id hate this but im not very affectionate and i hate tiktok so NTA to me", "YTA but softly, but you already realized that given your edits.\n\nIt's clear she wants to feel special again, don't downplay that, she'll appreciate if you play along, I think it's cute on her part, as someone else said, it doesn't matter if she got the idea out of Tiktok, she trust you enough to talk to you about it, that's nice to be honest.\n\nYou're not entirely an AH, but in this case you're a little bit, not a bad guy, maybe you just weren't paying attention to what she meant underneath, and that's ok.", "\"Ah, women, so mysterious, the ways in which they work will forever be a mystery.\"\n\n\"I mean, if you just listened to what we wanted-\"\n\n\"So mysterious, unfathomable even. Truly a mystery that shall never be solved.\"", "Seriously, I know so many men who get dismissive, pissy, etc. when their ladies say what they want, and then in five years' time, are wondering why their wives aren't interested in having sex with them anymore.", "Seriously, I love dudes doing the face-grabbing thing that I read in a novel as a teen. My husband's favorite trick is to come up to me at a random time, put his massive hands on the side of my face, stare intensely at me, and then give me the teeniest little kiss on the forehead or nose. Still gets me weak in the knees after all this tjme.", "Yeah, I agree with you. I'm thinking she's not even necessarily asking for MORE, just DIFFERENT.  She sees things that she thinks she would enjoy with her husband, and asking for it.  Sounds like she communicates clearly.  OP says he's physically affectionate, but maybe it's not in the ways she would like, and she's trying to redirect him.\n\nYTA", "Actually, a little bit of feeling like she misses our first dates. A friend of our recently got into a relationship, and my wife has been sharing the gossip with me. Lots of fresh romance. I didn't put the two together.\n\nSo yeah, we just need to find some new ways to date each other. Looked through some of what she likes, and honestly it's harmless. Just a little awkward, but all stuff we can play around with at home.", "Thanks, will be looking into this. She's usually a stickler for privacy too, so all in all I was surprised. Think she said something about a musical or play being on there that wasn't being updated anywhere else.", "But you UN fucked it and that's what counts!!!! You're a good egg. <3", "Ay to be fair that whole \u201clifting up the chin\u201d thing IS corny as hell \ud83d\ude2d I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that with a straight face and Ik my gf would die laughing.", "Read your edits. Make it up to her by reading some Sarah J Maas - it's one of the bigger spicy booktok followings.", "The most important thing about fucking up is acknowledging when you do, sincerely apologize, and not do it again. Your edits look like you're on the right track for that.", "I\u2019m only extra frustrated bc I am literal and to the point and say exactly what I mean and what I\u2019d like, I over communicate to the point of annoyance\u2026.\n\nIt did not make a difference to my ex, who had prior complained about how he never knew what women wanted and blah blah blah why are they so passive and manipulative blah blah \n\nI got \u201cyour brain works like a man\u2019s\u201d and then laughed at when He\u2019d ask what I wanted, I\u2019d tell him and it wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nSome men will weaponize incompetence regardless.

Usually the only times she lets it down are when we shower and before/after we go to bed. So it never really occured to me to run my hands through her hair, since usually it's tied up.\n\nI mean, I stroke her hair, but it's like pats.", "Thank you for the booktoks. I feel a little mortified I had a TIL moment, but yes my wife is very affectionate like that. I feel old lol.", "What do you feel is disingenuous about it? \n\nI mean, his problem is that his wife asked for attention and he says he will feel awkward providing that.  I can\u2019t see anything else being said, but if there\u2019s some other meaning I\u2019d love to hear it :)", "Thank you for explaining! I definitely get not want to ask for that kind of affection all the time. But I think without at least a little bit of direct communication about preferences/ ideal expectations it could veer into mind-reading territory. Especially if someone is more literal, or has a very different cultural background or upbringing from their partner - what\u2019s \u201cnormal,\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d can vary a ton!", "Thank you for answering! I think this must mainly come down to different communication styles then. My partner and I are both neurodivergent and we both think things like hints are silly and ineffective, I\u2019m much more attracted to explicit requests. \n\nBased on OPs post, it sounded to me like his wife was saying \u201cwatch this tik tok and then help me recreate it so I can post it and share in the trend.\u201dWithout more information that\u2019s how I would interpret it, as an artificial gesture for the public eye. Not as a genuine request of how she wants to be treated more generally. I\u2019m definitely the first to admit I don\u2019t get traditional romance though so thank you for broadening my understanding!", "I think he meant it would be awkward to do the stuff from the tik toks. My partner and I are very affectionate but if I was sent a video with some specific thing to do that isn't natural to me I'd feel very awkward trying to execute it.", "It\u2019s disingenuous because OP has said that he\u2019s already hands on with his wife. Also, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s saying the mimicking things from TikTok and movies feels awkward, not physically touching his wife.", ">, I am quite affectionate at home when it's just us. Lots of hugs/kisses/physical touching, you name it. Both our love languages is quality time and physical touch, courtesy of her research.\n\n\"It's awkward to show your wife affection? That's a hell of a statement\"\n\nYou did one of two things:\n\n1. Chose to purposely take the most insidious possible meaning of his statement while ignoring parts of his post, painting him in a bad light or\n2. lack reading comprehension and somehow missed an entire block of text, in which case I suggest reading posts twice from now on.\n\nSo I guess being disingenuous is only one of the possibilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for clarity.", "And there's 100% a fine line. It definitely matters a lot to me when someone says \"What can I do to make you feel good right now\". I think sometimes people forget that that's trying too.", "Fair point.", "I hadn\u2019t considered that take. It seemed to me he was stating he feels awkward showing affection to his wife. \nI mean she\u2019s not asking for highly specific things, she mentions running a hand through her hair. \n\nIf she\u2019s asking for that, I have doubts op is as physically affectionate as he believes he is.\n\nDisingenuous is the wrong way to describe it when someone doesn\u2019t see something how you do.", "Disingenuous would mean I deliberately chose one interpretation over another. I made one interpretation and didn\u2019t consider others until they were mentioned.  I think you are misusing the term there, or maybe assuming the most insidious possible meaning. \n\nLots is a subjective term. It may be a lot to op but it appears to me that it may not be a lot to his wife, hence her asking for gestures. \n\nI\u2019ll take your advice into consideration regarding reading twice. :)", "After your edit a judgment isn't necessary, glad to see someone actually take the criticism and do better. Your edit was super cute, OP, glad everything worked out and you both communicated!", "YTA She's telling you how she'd like to be touched. If you're going out the door and don't have time, you could say something sexy like, \"Ooh, I can't right now or I'll be late, but I will when I get home from work.\"", "YTA. Sounds like she\u2019s on \u201cbooktok\u201d so she\u2019s either into reading romance or is going to start to read romance books. She is telling you what gets her going and trying to involve you-to spice things up! I can see that you\u2019ve realised your error in your comments, so may I suggest IF she is reading those books, read them too. Let them inspire you, learn about what she craves and try to make it your own. Maybe do like a couples book club with these and talk things over together with wine.", "Yta", "After reading your edit: NTA\n\nGood on you for listening to the feedback and going to do some more mushy stuff <3", "NTA but don\u2019t forget the little things. \n\nIt always seems like my gf wants affection when I\u2019m in the middle of chores or a hobby as opposed to the hours upon hours we aren\u2019t doing anything but watching tv.", "Why does he HAVE to do what she wants?", "Maybe because it shows her how much you neglect non-sexual physical intimacy.", "He doesn\u2019t HAVE to do anything but he should at least TRY to listen to what she\u2019s trying to communicate to him.", "i understand this completely, but you could approach it more from a standpoint of it being something silly you can do and then laugh at together as opposed to a serious task. i think invalidating your wife\u2019s feelings was the main issue, its okay if youre not comfortable with everything. hope the talk helps!", ">She's not communicating clearly\n\nShe literally told him what she wanted him to do.", "Not communicating clearly? She flat out told him what she wanted? AND had a video example. Which part do you think is unclear?", "He did though and he doesn't want to. Clearly this isn't the first time she's brought this sort of thing up.", "Mate I'm cringing just reading this shit!", "I am reminded of all the folks that are told 'don't get me ANYTHING for Valentine' and go 'well clearly you were lying so here's roses and chocolate', or 'I would love one of these things for my birthday' and get some monstrosity instead.\n\nYour ex sucks btw.", "I really really enjoy when my partner strokes or plays with my hair. I also have curly hair that makes that difficult. If I straighten my hair it's a clear signal I want him to play with it. You said your wife has long silky hair. You really want to \"yes and\" your wife here? Brush it for her before you go to bed, then stroke it tangle free. Go for the bonus points \ud83d\ude09", "Not only did she literally tell him, she also had a video tutorial available! \n\nI really don't know how much clearer a person can communicate \"touch me like this\" if a direct verbal request + a video example isn't clear enough.", ">if I was sent a video with some specific thing to do that isn't natural to me I'd feel very awkward trying to execute it.\n\nWhy? \n\nI don't see this as being any different from a partner seeing something in porn and suggesting we try that position. Or seeing a cute date idea and wanting to try and recreate it. \n\nIt isn't roleplay, it's just \"touch me like this.\" How is that awkward in a relationship?", "Nope. You either read the entire post, then ignored the parts that disagreed with the type of person you want the OP to be in order to make your comment (which is what makes it disingenuous), or you didn't read all of it and made a misinformed comment. Though I suppose there is a third option, which is that you're just making stuff up based off a \"gut instinct\", which as we all know is notoriously accurate over text on the internet.  \n\n\nThe only info you have to go on is what is in the post. You can't just make up things like \"he probably isn't actually that affectionate with his wife, he just says that to make himself look better\" with zero things implying that that's the case.   \n\n\nAs others have said, being asked to do specific intimate things takes the natural romance out of it, and it can be jarring for someone who's not used to it. It doesn't HAVE to be that the OP is just starving his partner of intimacy.", "Whatever you say, friend. You seem to feel very strongly about this and I haven\u2019t been insisting my interpretation is the only possible one."]}
