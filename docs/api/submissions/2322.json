We each have children with our exes however, mine are grown and living on their own. After dating for 3 years we got married in January. His ex wife got remarried in the following July & decided to move an hour away and their two children (16 & 19) moved in with us. In the 4 months that they have lived with us, the ex wife has only seen the kids 4 times. Of the 4 times, we were not home for either a drop off or pick up. Each of those times the ex wife has walked into our house when we weren\u2019t there. My husband and I got in an argument about it because he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. I think it\u2019s disrespectful. (She used to live in the same house when they were married by the way.) She was told that \u201cI didn\u2019t want her coming in the house.\u201d She & I then had a Facebook messenger conversation where I explained that I didn\u2019t have a problem with her, but that I find it disrespectful to enter anyones home without adult permission. She apologized and insisted she didn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful. Then she came in the house again!!! When my husband messaged her about it again, she replied with a big rant about how I must be a horrible person for not wanting her to come in the house because she badly had to use the restroom.

Most of the women I know would rather hold it another hour than use their ex's bathroom.\n\nI would suggest that you be home as much as possible for these drop-offs, but I have a feeling she is communicating with the kids and coordinating a time so she can avoid you. So you might want to add a keyed lock to your bedroom door if nothing else.\n\nI was never in my ex's house (my old house) when she wasn't there.  At first the exchange would happen in the entry way, then the driveway, and ultimately a McD's halfway between our homes.", "NTA but it's not about her coming into the house, it's about her feeling free to enter *when you're not home*. That's the actual issue. Of course you don't want anyone doing that.", "NTA especially if she\u2019s letting herself into the house uninvited like you say.", "NTA. I thought maybe you were a little until I got to the part where she doesn\u2019t come in when you are home. I wonder what she does while in there. I would be setting up some cameras around the house if I was you.", "NTA- it sounds like you don\u2019t have a problem with herself but her invading your personal space", "NTA- she no longer lives there. Change the locks, and if that doesn't work and husband still won't back you, change the husband.", "NTA it's a very reasonable boundary. If she's an adult she is more than capable of using literally ANY other bathroom on the planet.", "Asking outsiders to stay out of your house is normal.\n\nShe lived in that house, but that's not her house anymore. I think this is the same as if previous tenants wanted to visit an apartment they rented. Her status as an ex-wife doesn't matter.\n\nNo one allows their exes to walk into their current residence without an invitation.\n\nI'm glad your husband supports you on this, but it seems you need to be harsher in setting boundaries.\n\nCan you make sure that you or your husband are home when she picks up and drops off the kids?\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is just basic common sense stuff. You don't go in someone's house without permission when they are not home. I could understand the bathroom excuse if it was a one off... but it wasn't, it was immediately after you asked her to stop coming in, and low and behold she finds an excuse to come in.\n\nAlso the note about her never coming in when you're there... thats not a coincidence. All of this seems very calculated. For what purpose who knows. \n\nI think it is perfectly reasonable to request that she not come in the house unless you or your husband is home. Even if invited by kids, because at this point she is taking advantage.", "ESH I don\u2019t think she is trying to come into your home under malicious intent. She probably feels a sense of comfortability with the home she used to live in, which is why she probably doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. This is something your husband needs to address with her and back you up if you are that uncomfortable, rather than saying it is you who doesn\u2019t want her in the home when you are both out of the house.\n\nOn the other hand I have a \u201csmall bladder\u201d, so I would absolutely need to use the restroom at some point over an hour drive there and back. It would suck to have to stop at an establishment to use the restroom when there is one in the house my kids share with their father and step-parent. \n\nI think you and your husband need to discuss boundaries you can agree on, then he needs to be the one to discuss it with his ex wife in terms of your United front (not just blaming you). I do think it is reasonable for her to use the restroom at your house after a drive to get the kids. Sometimes teens are forgetting things or are not ready at pickup, so if she has to use the restroom while she waits on the kids, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. I think it\u2019s ESH because you talked to her about it and she still did it. Boundaries and expectations should be agreed upon so it is fair and harmonious for all parties involved, including the kids.", "[deleted]", "Honestly your NTA, kids or no kids doesn't give anyone the right to enter a property without the owners permission.

For now, I'm going to say ESH\n\nDid either of the kids invite her in on these two occasions? If so then this is something to bring up with them, which would sorta make YTA.\n\nHowever, if she didn't get permission from the kids, then NTA.\n\nOne key point here also not in your favor, is saying she needed \"adult permission.\" One of the kids is 19... that's an adult.", "Umm her kids are letting her in it\u2019s their house also so", "NTA. It's your house. You have every right to want people to ask before coming in.", "ESH. \n\nI understand that you want to maintain boundaries in your home, that is completely fair, but it is also your stepkids' home as well. It's not wild that they would maybe invite their mom in to see something in their room, that she might help bring in luggage *or* that she might need to use the bathroom. \n\nWhat actually needs to happen here is that you and your husband need to align with your stepkids and his ex wife about what this relationship looks like going forward. It's not wild that they may not think that its a big deal to welcome a part of their family into the home.", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. She isn't coming inside making herself at home. She came in to get the kids. Why can't her kids be comfortable with her coming over? They've probably got anxiety over the situation because they know stepmom doesn't like biomom entering into \"her\" home, even though its THEIR home too! Seriously lady...why did you even marry someone with children?", "Info: how is she getting in the house? Does she still have a key or something?", "YTA because per your comments the kids let her in. She\u2019s not just walking in with no invite. It\u2019s only been 4 times. Who even cares. Once every 3 months and you don\u2019t even see her when it happens. Your husband and children don\u2019t care. Let it go", "YTA. She is their mom, don't you think they will invite he to come in? At least to offer her a glass of water? Are you going to start an argument over that with your husband?if he is a good dad, he will chose his children over you", "YTA. What are you so worked up over here? You just come off looking insecure. You seem to be bent out of shape related to the fact that your whole family (and her) have history in the house you've moved into.\n\nHer kids live in the house, and they are apparently inviting her in. Whether that's to use the restroom or sit down and have tea, they are allowed to have guests in. \n\nIf you want to press this with your husband then I guess go ahead but you're going to be the villain with your stepkids and not just her. Is this worth it?", "YTA. Her kids live there. It's great that she and your husband still seem to have a decent relationship when it comes to their kids. You're all on the same team here, she's not your enemy.", "YTA - you sound petty and bitter, is it really a surprise she doesn\u2019t want to come in the house when you are home.\n\nUnless she is stealing from you or leaving a mess, what is the big deal with her coming in to get/wait for her kids?", "This is coming off looking more insecure on your part than anything else.    Like it or now when you have kids with someone you're tied at the hip due to co-parenting.   One of the kids is an adult and both live there so they have a right to have a guess unless there's something I'm not understanding about the situation.      I'm sure there's a certain amount of curiosity about her kid's living situation and that may be all that's behind it.     Yes, you  have the right to say who is and who is not in your home  but it's those kid's home too.    If it was originally her house, it might have been a poor decision for you to live there and it might have been better to have neutral territory.    Work with the situation.  She doesn't appear to be your enemy.", "YTA and petty and possibly controlling and a little insecure", "ESH- My step dad was this way about our dad because he was a jealous AH. It really annoyed us children and caused resentment all around. He and my mom would argue a lot about it. With my own divorce, my ex comes in every time and we always speak about our now teen son. Sometimes its a quick everything's great and sometimes we have much longer discussions. As much as I hate my ex, he and his new wife are an important part of my son's life and are basically family whether I like it or not. Sometimes my son likes to show his dad things he made or how he changed up his room and my ex comes all the way in for those things. But my ex does stay in the foyer mostly and kinda waits for a nod to come further so it sounds like your husband's ex could definitely be a lot more respectful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My ex husband has a key to my house, and our schedules are very different so if he needs to pick up or drop something off for our son,  I have no problem with it.  But he knows I'm OK with it and if I asked him not to he wouldn't.  The fact that your asked her not to,  she seemed receptive and then did it again,  no,  that's a power play and your hubby needs to back you up.", "NTA, I have an acquaintance whose ex husband did the something similar, except she was home and he would just shove inside claiming he needed the bathroom. Also that it was \"their daughter's house, too, and she's entitled to invite guests inside.\" It's a power play. She wants to see how far she can push boundaries and how much she can get away with. Snoop around your house. Maybe even cause a rift in your marriage.", "NTA. I was fully prepared from the title to come in the opposite, but 100% NTA. Trust is built. It\u2019s YOUR home now just as much as it is her ex husbands. If she wants YOU to be comfortable with her waltzing in YOUR house with no one else there\u2026SHE needs to put in the work to make that trust happen. Your feelings are valid, and I\u2019d feel the same way. I suspect that because she also used to live there (and obviously still has left over familiarity/feeling of ownership with the place) she has convinced herself she still has a *right* to do that. She doesn\u2019t. Her intentions may very well be completely innocent, but she still needs to build that trust in order to prove that and gain YOUR trust. Until that day happens, she needs to wait outside until one of you gets home OR get explicit permission from BOTH of you. If she refuses to respect that rule, you need to demand a neutral meeting place for pickup/drop off of the kids. Your husband should be backing you up on this. The kids (who I assume have keys) are also old enough to help back you up on this, although I think the better route is to avoid putting them in that position in the first place unless the drama of it becomes absolutely necessary.\n\nEdited to add- I just reread and saw the kids ages (practically adults themselves). They may not be helping the matter. They likely WANT their mom to feel \u201cwelcome\u201d to come in whenever and enabling it. The issue here though is trust. They obviously trust their own mother, but you don\u2019t because she\u2019s never take the time to build that trust between her and you.\n\nThat\u2019s going to be a tough conversation to have with them\u2026 one that I doubt will end without some drama. I think your best bet is to find a way to keep the kids out of it as best you can, and MOST importantly have your HUSBAND back you up on it. It shouldn\u2019t be on the kids to \u201cpolice\u201d it. HE has to help you establish this boundary and \u201clay down the law\u201d.", "So, when she picks up the kids, **can this be rearranged to be at a drop off center** or at a **relative's house i**f you two won't be home?  Maybe **a nearby fast food place or coffee shop, which would have that bathroom** she needs?  \n\nThis would solve the problem of her invading your space and you feeling like she's prying.

Herein lies the entire issue.\n\nThese children are 16 and 19, they are more than capable of getting themselves ready and out the door by a given time. I think it's perfectly reasonable that they would just meet their mom at the door. There's really no reason that she needs to be coming in the house everytime she picks them up.\n\nSeems to me like this woman is the one pulling the power trip.

The kids let her in then, she didn't just break in.", "You and OP are reading way too much into this, I doubt the ex-wife thinks about OP, the way the OP seems to think about her, OP\u2019s insecurity is showing. \n\nAlso, there are 3 other people in the house, if someone is not stealing or causing damage, why does one person overrule the majority, seems like a good way to get your step-kids to resent you.", "And we're back to the begining. Again, it's not about stealing or causing damage. It's about an invasion of privacy, by someone who has no good reason for doing it. And is continuing to do it despite being asked to stop.\n\nSo you're saying that OP doesn't deserve a say in creating boundaries for her own home? Just because she doesn't represent the \"majority\"?\n\nI think her nearly adult stepchildren will survive not showing their mommy their rooms every time she comes to pick them up.", "NTA.

If no one was at the house at the time and she was coming in then yea you would be NTA. However it's clear the kids, one of which is a legal adult, is having her come inside. I'm sure if she refused to come inside the kids would question it, and if answered honestly the kids will hate you which will cause issues in the marriage.\n It's clear there hasn't been a conversation with the kids about not allowing their mother inside when you're not there (I'm not going to include the husband since he doesn't have the issue and you seem like you'd be upset if she was inside the house with him while you're not around) which ofcourse will still lead the kids to hate you and cause issues with the marriage. \nOf the 4 ppl in the house only you have the problem.

Great advice. This is how you end up with 4 cats and a box of wine every night.", "It's not petty. It's an extremely reasonable boundary that ex is crossing repeatedly, and knowingly.

Win-win babe", "If the kids shouldn\u2019t be involved in this then op and husband should be home during the handoffs. Do you really expect kids to tell their mom no you can\u2019t come in to pee? Op never mentions concern of her snooping, more that she just walks in. Per op\u2019s comments the kids opened the main door when she pulled up and she walked up and opened the screen and walked in. Clearly the kids are greeting her. Op needs to be home when the mom arrives or they need to coordinate pick up/drop off elsewhere.
