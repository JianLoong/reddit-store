I used to date a resident in the 80s and they were doing that garbage because it was that most sacred of all cows: tradition! In the late 80s/early 90s there was a push to stop it because research showed that those 72 hour shifts were dangerous for patients. I worked for several years in teaching hospitals and saw first hand how those shifts effected medical care. I have literally written orders for residents to sign because they couldn\u2019t think clearly enough to write it themselves (this was before electronic charting, so I assume that, at least, has improved). I left hospital-based care in the mid-90s, and serious discussions about getting rid of those shifts were going on. I had thought they were ended!\n\nOP, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through that. I hope you\u2019re closer to finishing up your residency that you are to the beginning of it! \n\nYou are NTA. Listen to your GF! She\u2019s a gem with a level head and understanding heart. She gets it. As you can see with her family, not everyone does. Let her educate them and set them straight. And bring her a nice bouquet of flowers for being so supportive!\n\nBest of luck for your successful completion of your residency!", "NTA. They should be happy their daughter/sister is with someone who has a job and motivation to progress.", "NAH\n\nI really don't think your gf's family is completely in the wrong but obviously you couldn't have done anything much different. The situation sucks.\n\nI do hope you appreciate what your gf is putting up with for your career.", "NTA\n\nPeople tend not to understand others working anything but 9 to 5, anyone working shift work will testify that people think they are off during the day and can do things (besides sleep). This is an extreme version of shift work but it still applies.", "You're absolutely right. My girlfriend was with me throigh the last few months of med school and when I was trying to get into the program, she completely gets it and we are trying to handle things the best we can. Her family members don't. At all.", "This. I get Christmas off once every FOUR years. She needs to handle her family if she understands.", "This. 100%. Everyone needs to be on the same page and not so condescending towards you. You have a hard job, with grueling hours. If you\u2019re both on the same page great. If she needs more attention tell her to move along. No need to make anyone miserable in a relationship if it\u2019s not working. She should also wrangle her family", "Uh no. No mistake. Op biologically needed sleep and if the famjly only wants to be there when op is awake then they have to work around op's work schedule.\n\nIt's wildly unreasonable to expect someone to endanger their health for a social visit - and going without sleep after a 72 hour shift with little sleep *is* a serious health risk.", "All hospitals do that to interns and residents. My niece just finished her Fellowship and told me about her internship & residency. Her hours were just as bad as OP's.", "Personally, I wouldn't talk to them until they apologize and show that they understand your job is more important than pleasing their completely selfish needs, but I can be petty, and I'm not close to my family. I know most people aren't so willing to risk harming a relationship.   \n(thankfully I ADORE all my ex's parents, so this isn't an issue I've had (I miss one of my exs moms more than him haha). My family on the other hand has gone over a decade without more than an email between us.)", "Yes, the number of times Ive been told \"but you don't work in the morning\" when I decline plans by saying I have to work is ridiculous\n\nLike, yeah, I don't work in the morning. I SLEEP in the morning. If I don't work, I can force myself to be awake at normal human times, but I'm going to crash later, and I'd rather not crash at work", "Yes, the number of times Ive been told \"but you don't work in the morning\" when I decline plans by saying I have to work is ridiculous\n\nLike, yeah, I don't work in the morning. I SLEEP in the morning. If I don't work, I can force myself to be awake at normal human times, but I'm going to crash later, and I'd rather not crash at work", "Then ignore them.\n\nHonestly it wouldn't surprise me if your girlfriend turned off your alarm.  You're trying to do too much and 6 uninterrupted hours of sleep is like a bare minimum. You getting sleep can dictate if people live or die in your line of work.\n\nI know that sucks and it's good you want to be an involved partner but it's part of the career path you've chosen.", "What really gets me about this is those very doctors will tell you how unhealthy this is and refer you to mental health for keeping the same hours that they do.  \nI just don't understand how or why things every got like this.   \nIt seriously baffles me.  \nWe should want our doctors well rested and on the top of their game, yet we give them shifts that all but guarantee sleep deprivation and mistakes.   \nThe whole system is seriously messed up and hurts both doctors and patients.   \nI was shocked to learn that Dr's unions are virtually non-existent too.  \nI guess they just don't have the time to fight for sane and safe work conditions?", "I don't think putting in the crazy hours to become a doctor is neglecting a girlfriend who presumably will benefit from your career. And it sounds like your girlfriend gets the long term picture. NTA. Ignore the judgmental AHs who don't get the situation.", "NTA. This is some weird entitled power trip", "NTA in any way.  Remember this moment when they come back and want to borrow money from you because you are \u201esuccessful\u201c.", "NTA, apologies if this has already been said. I haven't read all the comments yet but why is it not only condoned but expected that doctors get so little sleep.\n\nAs a society we don't like it when people drive tired but you can operate on people. I find that absolutely shocking.", "NTA at all and as a doctor in the UK I\u2019m horrified at your shift patterns.", "At least once a day I post \u201cWhat is wrong with these people?!!\u201d or something to that effect. Getting an early start today. \n\nNTA. But your girlfriend\u2019s family sure is.", "NTA. I had in laws like this and my ex never stood up to them. We\u2019re divorced now. I hope your gf tells them off", "INFO: Is this in the US?", "NTA, your GF should be raising hell on your behalf.", "NTA", "NTA  Not at all.  \nThe family needs to be more understanding of your obligations. \nYour gf should have done more in the way of giving them a heads-up and of defending you, since she actively chose to let you sleep until 10pm. \nAnd the brother needs to butt the hell out because who is he to say you are neglecting his sister?", "Research has shown that those 72 hour shifts increase the likelihood of injuring a patient. The human brain isn\u2019t made to go without sleep for long periods of time. All teaching hospitals do it because of tradition and saving money. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I was told that by a couple of attending physicians and a chief of staff (the chief of staff was pretty defensive about it). The residents wouldn\u2019t be able to do it without nurses and respiratory therapists supporting them.\n\nSo yes. Those shifts aren\u2019t healthy. They\u2019re unnecessary. And I fully blame the hospitals and medical schools.", "To be 'present' with GF's family OP would need to get about 2h of sleep. After 72 hour shift. These people can absolutely go kick rocks.", "Thank you for the lovely comment. Technically and even legally, they shouldn't do 72-hour shifts but I am in a surgical program and there are way too few residents to begin with so this happens.", "Yes she did that both before and after they arrived. They knew all about it", "Yes", "The gf\u2019s opinion should be the only one to matter. The family doesn\u2019t matter since they refused to accept what their daughter said. They are total assholes for not only treating op like crap, but for treating her like crap as well while they are guests. NTA", "I work night shift so I frequently get \"You're sleeping late!\" Like yes Susan. I am. Thank you for noticing it's my mother fucking midnight!"]}
