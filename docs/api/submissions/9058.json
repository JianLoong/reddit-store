My girlfriend's family are quite upset with me but let me give you a bit of background information. \n\nI (25F) am currently a resident. My speciality is a particularly demanding one. I have 24-hour shifts every other day, and I get to go on 72-hour shifts at the hospital with only a few hours of sleep 4 times a month.\n\nI have been dating my girlfriend (23F) for two years. Her parents and brother (29) live in a different city. They were going to come visit us for a few days. My girlfriend had told me that beforehand. She obviously knows my schedule. I offered to help her before her parents got here, I only managed to get a few items, gifts, etc. Later she told me to carry on with my routine and said she'd handle the hosting duties. \n\nI had one of those 72-hour nightmare shifts, we had countless admissions, and only got to sleep very occasionally. It is safe to say I was almost a zombie by the time I got home.\n\nAfter I got home, took a shower and told my girlfriend I was going to sleep a little bit. I set an alarm to get up and help my GF in the kitchen, watch a movie or something. I slept through the whole day and got up around 10PM. When I went downstairs, I saw my GFs parents and her brother. I had completely forgotten about my GF's family coming over later that day. They had a very unimpressed look. \n\nMy girlfriend's mother told me it was extremely disrespectful of me to not be there to welcome them the first time they were coming over to visit. I got similar comments from all of them. (My GF said she purposefully didn't wake me up because I was going to go back to the hospital in a few hours and I needed my sleep. Her family didn't change their minds.)\n\nHer brother later told me (privately) that I was neglecting my girlfriend and being selfish in this relationship. He said his sister deserved much better than someone who wouldn't even acknowledge her family.\n\nI feel horribly about all this. I asked a few friends but they're all terrible when it comes to these kinds of advice. I honestly don't know.  AITA?\n\nEdit:  I was allowed to leave the hospital around 2 PM, got home around 3 PM, took a shower and went to sleep at 3.30, I set an alarm for 6 PM but slept through it.

I mean it is kind of expected to be present when your partner's family is visiting. So I get that they were confused and a little upset. But it was an honest mistake on your side, and your girlfriend chose not to wake you, and also told her family why you were absent.

This is like the nurse who posted a while back that her in-laws still can't understand why she can't get Christmas off- YEARS into their marriage. Some people just can't or won't get the issues with a healthcare career. So now on to your real questions... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Can you trust your girlfriend to understand this career and have your back? Are you both genuinely down for what this entails? If not, you'll need a new girlfriend (or a new career, your pick.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Can you trust your girlfriend to manage her family. Can she take the lead on educating them and setting limits with them? Is she genuinely ok being the buffer if they continue to be willfully ignorant about the reality of your career? At this point I would let her them that your career is off the table for discussion and have you block them all on text or social media and limit your interactions to IRL visits and phone calls.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Can you trust yourself to learn to cheerfully ignore their eye rolling and behind the scenes muttering? This is a question about boundaries and independence and you may not have been raised to ignore family. But continuing this relationship and this career will require serious boundaries or something is going to have to give.", "NTA all day long. Too bad they can't understand that working for something takes sacrifices.", "NTA.  If they are so concerned about you welcoming them they can come when you're not scheduled to work so much.

Her family are way out of line here. People who don't do shift work sometimes fail to see the difference and think \"well I'm awake and out and about so everyone should be\"", "Nta.  Your girlfriend understands.  Her family is out of line.  Don't let it bother you.", "NTA.  Sleep is a necessity, not a luxury, and if your girlfriend was that concerned about you being up to greet your parents, she would have woken you.", "Absolutely NTA. They are acting like you were just flat out ignoring them. You had a very valid reason to sleep. Not for nothing but I would prefer medical professionals to be rested. Residency is brutal but it seems like your girlfriend gets it. They are being ridiculous. They should be applauding you for working so hard towards something.", "NTA. In no circumstance would you be TA. Those rotations are hell, anyone who can\u2019t understand that can kick rocks. Move on, don\u2019t give it any more thought.", "NTA\n\nI can't tell if your gf deserves some of the blame for the fallout as it doesn't seem as if she told them your exhausting schedule and she was NOT going to wake you up.", "NTA\nIf they can't understand the demanding nature of being a resident, then there is no reasoning with them. And her brother is an A for saying you aren't good enough while literally working yourself half to death to make a good life for yourself and your girlfriend.", "Your health and well being is what is most important.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you have important time commitments and responsibilities that supersede their need to be doted on. They sound awful and entitled.", "Nta. Needing rest is important. Everyone should be understanding", "[deleted]", "NTA. It also seems like your gf didn't wake you up in time for their visit. Even though I'm not saying she should or shouldn't have done so, ask her why she didn't. If it's just a soft 'didn't want to bother you' kind of response, and you really intended to get up at 6, tell her next time to do so. If it's more of a 'I know you need your sleep' thank her and tell her to wake you up next time. Just make sure you two are on the same page, that it doesn't get into a passive-aggressive arms race because she too feels slighted by this.", "NTA. You werent out cruising the bars.

You owe it to your patients to get decent rest when you can, knowing how brutal your schedule can be.

However, it is very understandable to need the amount of sleep you got working like you do. \n\nI think the whole situation could have been avoided with better planning. Do you know when your shifts are in advance? If so I would have said to let your gf and her parents know about the grueling shift you\u2019d have to work so that they could have rearranged their visit or at least been aware of the circumstances of your schedule. Again, I don\u2019t know if this was possible for you so I\u2019m not saying this makes you the A-hole. \n\nAll in all I\u2019d say NTA.

Just a heads up that when you get in, I'll be coming off of an overnight shift, so I probably won't see you until the next day.\"\n\nYour girlfriend should have been more helpful too in communicating what your circumstances were to her family so they would have no reason to feel offended. \n\nAs-is, it seems like this was something that was just allowed to happen when communication could have gone a long way to smooth this over in advance.", "Yeah it doesn't even sound like the gf is upset by it since she said she didn't wake her up bc she knew she'd have to work shortly anyway and needed to sleep.

Unless you asked for his opinion, he can keep his mouth shut, especially if he's in your home. \n\nThese people weren't your guests and you didn't invite them. You are under no obligation to do any hosting duties. I understand wanting to help your gf to be nice to her and that's great, but her guests don't get to have any expectations of you since they aren't your guests.

Does the family not approve of this relationship, has your girlfriend been complaining to her family about you rather than communicating issues with you? Whatever the case may be you guys need to have a conversation and she needs to deal with her families mistreatment of you. If someone is physically exhausted to the point they can\u2019t wake up or can barely function then how can anyone expect them to specifically wake up to greet them? It\u2019s ludicrous that they think themselves so important that you should suffer through sleep deprivation to be graced with their presence. Don\u2019t twist things in your head and start believing the bs they are spewing. You weren\u2019t rude and you didnt show a lack of care for your partner.

Your gf sounds like a wonderful person and she understood and left you alone to sleep. I am not trying to put all Dr are gods or anything like that but any first responders, Dr\u2019s etc where people lives are literally in your hands and residents are notoriously overworked and exhausted any chance you get to sleep you should sleep especially after a 72 hour shift.

After dictating this long, complicated note, the OB resident does her routine bit about it being an uncomplicated delivery and routine postpartum recovery was expected.  She was quiet for just shy of 5 minutes then she said \u2018no, that wasn\u2019t this baby\u2019 in the most defeated voice.   \nYour girlfriend did the right thing letting you sleep and her family need to give their heads a shake.", "NTA.
