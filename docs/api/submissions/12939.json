We don\u2019t live in the US nor in any western country. We come from a dual income household, with both parents being high earners by middle class standards.\n\nWe used to be best friends when we were younger, but things started to turn bad when we were both in college. We both attended the same engineering college, just one year apart.\n\nWhile I was busting my ass to get top marks, my sister was \u201cshopping for a rich husband\u201d. She would take all the money our parents sent her, spend it on clothes and makeup, then beg me to lend her some of my allowance so she can afford necessities. I used to do that at first, but then I cut her off when I got fed up. That was the first crack.\n\nThe second crack came when she did not pass her classes, so she ended up having to repeat her second year (second out of five), then we were in the same class. Because we had the same major, we had the exact same schedule. Then professors started comparing us (I was usually first or second in class, she was near the bottom, and had a habit of skipping class).\n\nThe final crack came when she got a rich BF, while I was dating a fellow classmate from a very poor background. She was constantly condescending, telling me how I will end up spending all my money on him and his poor family, and that I should follow her example and get a rich husband.\n\nOur last year, she chose to drop out of school and marry her rich husband. They had a very grand wedding, and the bridal gifts he gave her included a BMW and enough gold to buy a small apartment.\n\nI married my husband after we graduated and worked for a year. We had a small wedding (80 people), and my bridal gifts were modest (about what he made in a month). She started ridiculing him in front of his and our family, so my mom ended up kicking her out of the wedding.  \n\nFast forward to now, I have a 10 years old son that goes to a private school, my husband and I own our house, we bought his parents an apartment, and we go on a vacation abroad twice a year\u2026 all to say we are living well.\n\nMy sister\u2019s husband divorced her because he \u201cfell in love\u201d with a 20 something young woman. And because all his wealth actually belongs to his parents, she came out with a measly sum in child support, a lot of jewellery and brand name clothes and her car. If she had been good with money, it would have been enough to start her own business. But she spent it all away, and now she is asking me for help in the form of lending her money to start a small business.\n\nI told her absolutely not, she tried to push, I blocked her everywhere and she can\u2019t get access to my job or to the gated community where we live.\n\nShe is currently living with our parents, along with her 3 kids, and from what my mom is saying, they are also getting fed up with her, but also she is apparently having a really hard time.
