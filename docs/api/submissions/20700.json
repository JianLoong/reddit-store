He was recently engaged to his long time girlfriend. A few years ago his girlfriend tried to set me up with one of her friends, didn\u2019t pan out but we ended up giving it another shot about a year or so ago for a few weeks before I met my current girlfriend. I immediately cut things off with the friend, let\u2019s call her Sara. Her and I never had sex and things were pretty casual. I was really nice about it but she was really upset. My current girlfriend and I moved in together due to circumstances, one being her being very sick and needing extra help. During this time Sara proceeded to religiously stalk both of our social media even going as far as to send and unsend messages to my girlfriend. She popped up every day on my girlfriends Instagram and TikTok views. One day she even messaged me while my girlfriend was in the hospital asking to talk with me and basically fishing to see if I would be willing to leave my girlfriend. I didn\u2019t respond and ignored her. During this time both my friend and his girlfriend were asking me to talk to Sara and see her even though I have a girlfriend. They both had met my girlfriend on a few different circumstances and my girlfriend tried to befriend my friends girlfriend, inviting her to dinner and whatnot.  I eventually texted Sara in hopes I could shut down whatever it is that was going on. She said that she was hoping something had changed and that she missed me and had started to develop serious feelings for me. I let her know they were not reciprocated and that I was in a committed relationship and blocked her. My girlfriend messaged her as well telling her to leave us alone. Fast forward a few months to the engagement. My friend reaches out and let\u2019s me know I am invited to the wedding but I won\u2019t be allowed a date.. aka my girlfriend can\u2019t come and that Sara will also be there. I obviously won\u2019t be going as they have continually disrespected my relationship and are trying to force their friend on me alone again. \n\nSo I\u2019m asking with all this information, am I in the right or am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1687839155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k30vt/aita_for_not_going_to_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Avoid any and all interaction with Sara.", "**NTA**   The guy is not your friend, he's his fianc\u00e9e's puppet.   You need to talk to him in person and tell him you are disappointed that he feels comfortable disrespecting your relationship after all Sara did.", "NTA. Your friend doesn't respect you, or your relationship. As a matter of fact, he is worse than his girlfriend who is trying to support her friend-Sara(though she is wrong).\n\nDon't go to the wedding, the reason your gf isn't invited is because they want you to give Sara \"another friend.", "NTA. Time for new friends. It seems pretty clear that your friend and his fiance have been encouraging Sara to try to date you despite you being both not interested and already in a committed relationship. They have no respect for your relationship or your wishes. Even if you didn't have a gf, you don't want to date Sara, and that's perfectly fine. I would not want to stay in contact with people who treated me like this.\n\nAlso...block Sara on everything. I don't know why you haven't done that yet, but seems like it would solve a decent portion of your issues with her. Make your accounts private too if you have to.", "NTA. Sometimes you grow out of relationships because you mature as an individual.", "You\u2019re doing the right thing putting your girlfriend first. This is a clear setup that could end badly.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou need new friends. I can't even believe you still speak to any of them. You should be cutting ties with them just out of respect for your girlfriend, but even if you were single, they shouldn't be trying to set you up with someone you've already told them isn't a match for you. That sounds like they want to be the best-friends-dating-best-friends group and don't really care what you think or want.", "NTA It is customary for weddings to allow partners. This feels like a setup and you should not go for the sake of your relationship. There is nothing wrong with prioritizing your partner over a friend.", "NTA. Unfortunately that person isn\u2019t acting like your best friend anymore. You have to evaluate that title based on current actions, and right now they\u2019re manipulating you.", "INFO: Are other people allowed to bring dates?\n\nIf this is a situation where there are six invited guests, no +1s, and he called you specifically to give you the heads up that Sara would be there so you could be prepared to shut her down again, then that's cool of him and I'd go. If this is a normal 80 guest wedding and you're the only one who doesn't get a +1, obviously that's completely different.", "NTA. Your current course of action is the correct one. If your friend continues to side with his soon to be wife and Sarah, you may need to just ditch the whole thing. He clearly doesn't respect your choices. Block your stalker and if she keeps following you and especially your girlfriend you should start documenting it and share with law enforcement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You dropped Sara awfully fast, and I'm a little confused why she's so attached *now*, yet wasn't attached the last time you guys broke up. \n\nAnd how are your friends disrespecting your gf besides wanting you to meet Sara? I get why you'd be annoyed by that, but you also mention that your gf has tried to befriend friend's gf- was she mean to her?\n\nDon't get me wrong, Sara's an AH either way, but I need more information to judge you.", "Idk sounds like something is missing here, did you lead Sara to believe that you were interested in something serious?

OP has indicated his intent to commit himself to his GF, and his friend should be supporting him in it, not trying to undermine him. That starts on day 1.", "I mean as in, did OP tell best friend directly : \"Hey, best friend, i am no longer interested in Sara. Can you please tell her to leave me alone?\"\n\n(Since said best friend didnt want to invite OP's girlfriend. But if the best friend still unhinged and still pair OP with Sara, I guess NTA)", "I jumped to conclusions. That's on me, and I apologize.\n\nBut still, seriously. From the moment they heard the word \"relationship\" the appropriate thing to do would have been to dissuade Sara's fantasies, not play match manipulator.", "Fair point, in the end, they didnt invite op girlfriend.\n\nSo op isnt nta for not going to the wedding party."]}
