Finally, Paul got annoyed and told Ryan to stop. Ryan did stop, but he kept hovering over Lily while she was chopping. \n\nI asked Ryan to sit down until dinner was ready, but Ryan insisted that he just wanted to help. Finally, Lily asked him and I to help set the table and greet people arriving. We did, but things were still tense. \n\nI did pull Ryan to the side and reminded him again to only help Lily if she asked for it.

Ryan may felt he was well-intentioned but he just trampled all over Lily's boundaries and her agency. He may or may not be an AH, but I think this whole thing was definitely concerning enough that you need to figure that out. Lily has lived her whole life pre-Ryan without chopping off her hand or dropping everything on the floor or whatever it was he expected her to do without his \"help.\" He needs to understand how infantilizing and offensive his behavior was even if it was coming from a place of concern. \n\nMaybe ask him how he'd respond if he was behind the wheel and you kept saying \"there's a red light coming up\" and \"there's a car in the lane next to you\" and \"you might want to start braking now.\" It would be irritating at minimum. If he asked you to stop and you refused and said \"I just don't want you to get in a wreck\" and kept it up, then how would he feel? If he isn't able to have the lightbulb over the head moment where he realizes how annoying, then offensive, then hurtful his behavior towards Lily was, then you should move on.

You need to figure out which he is.", "YTA but hear me out.  Even considering sticking up for Ryan makes you an asshole by proxy.  He wasn't being helpful in any way, and it sounds like you're trying to justify his behavior to us.   When he insisted on taking the knife from Lily, that was your cue to pull him aside and tell him to knock it the fuck off or leave the party.  Ruining a child's game is just so far beyond the pale, if I had been in your position, he would have been leaving the party alone.", "NTA, he was blindsplaining to a blind person, lol.

Even more so you told him do not try help unless she asks you to and hellloo you ignored me and got upset because you offended not just me but my brother, his wife and also their children and wondered why they asked you to leave \n\nAlso say if he continues that behavior on any visits he won't be welcome to visit them first impressions count and he blew his so badly with your family period.

NTA.. but your boyfriend definitely is.\n   The \u2018unhelpful helper\u2019 may be best defined as the excessive offering of help, soothing, or assistance to others without the explicit communication that help is needed, wanted or what type of help may even be helpful for the recipient. The story they tell themselves that keeps them stuck is: \u201cI am a helper, a very good helper in fact. And if the people in my life would only start accepting my help, everything will be ok.\u201d\n   In their actions the signaler is making at least three assumptions:\n\nThe recipient needs help (They are about to make a grave mistake and must be rescued.)\n\nThe recipient wants help (Why wouldn\u2019t they? I\u2019m so good at it!)\n\nThe signaler knows exactly the what kind of help is necessary (My type of help is the best, of course!)\n\nThe \u2018unhelpful helper\u2019 may receive disconfirming feedback from others regarding these signals \u2013 you\u2019re smothering me, you don\u2019t trust me, you\u2019re always nagging, etc.\u00a0 However, this feedback is easily dismissed by the signaler when they lean on their good intentions \u2013 \u201cBut can\u2019t you see, I\u2019m only trying to help!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 And yet, do intentions really matter if the consequence of the signal is one that pushes people away? \n\nThe \u2018unhelpful helper\u2019 reminds me of the cartoon character Elmyra Duff from the animated television series Tiny Toon Adventures. A main character of the show, Elmyra is a cheerful young girl with red hair, kind-hearted, energetic and always willing to help others. She has a deep love for animals and offering help to any friend she deems in need. \u00a0However, anyone who is the recipient of her help is sure courting with disaster. Elmyra is so infatuated with caring for and giving affection to her animals, that she unknowingly causes them great discomfort.\u00a0 She chases them and squeezes them; she bathes them and diapers them.\u00a0 She is so over-zealous in her affection and care for her pets, in ways that are off-putting and at times harmful, her pets are often trying to escape. She does not really mean to mistreat her pets; she simply doesn\u2019t understand the negative effects of her behavior.\u00a0 Elmyra always means well, but she is oblivious to the trouble she causes.\u00a0 When the consequence of her behavior is a pet running away or a friend being disgruntled at her for providing misguided help, Elmyra bursts into sobs.\n\n  Examples of social signals by an \u2018unhelpful helper\u2019 may include:\n\nUnsolicited advice giving, offering suggestions, or problem solving for someone else\n\nFrequent checking up on others \u2018Are you ok? Are you sure? Are you really, really sure?\u2019\n\nFrequent or excessive soothing signals \u2013 verbal reassurance, physical touch, prolonged concern faces\n\nOffering to fix or taking over for someone else \u2013 \u2018I can fix that\u2019 or \u2018I can do it for you.\u2019\n\nFrequent or excessive reminders to others \u2013 \u2018Did you___? Have you___?\u2019\n\nWhen \u2018unhelpful helping\u2019 happens, it sends the following message:\n  \nI must help/soothe/rescue you because you are _________________ (weak, fragile, incapable, unintelligent, disorganized, ill, untrustworthy, inexperienced) and I am _____________ (experienced, wiser, smarter, organized, stronger, trustworthy, capable, healthier, stronger).\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t recognized that you want or need help yet.\u00a0 The help I offer you will be so amazing that you will thank me when it is all over.\n\nThus, the receiver of this signal may feel inferior, infantilized, invalidated or unfairly labeled incapable; and who wants to feel this way?\u00a0 Here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 the signaler may have no idea that their behaviors are sending this message!! After all their intentions are good, aren\u2019t they? This is what can make it so stinking hard to accept the maladaptive nature of \u2018unhelpful helping.\u2019 Try giving Elmyra feedback that she is causing discomfort in her animals and friends, without her disputing, denying, explaining or falling apart.\u00a0 She would have to open to the idea that just because she thinks her behaviors are helpful, doesn\u2019t mean they actually are.\u00a0 In fact, the signaler may not believe (or only secretly so) that others are weak or incapable, or that they themselves are superior \u2013 enter self-enquiry practice.
