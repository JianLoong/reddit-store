He is the type of guy who would give a coworker money for their rent or buy groceries for our neighbor. However, he can take it too far at times. He often tries to help people without asking if they need or want his help. \n\nEvery year, my brother (35M), Paul, and his wife (33F), Lily, host a holiday dinner. This year Ryan attended for the first time. Before we left for their house, I told Ryan that Lily was legally blind and had been her entire life. She knew what she could and could not do. I told Ryan to only help Lily if she asked for help.\n\nWe arrived early so I could help Paul and Lily cook. While we were cooking, Ryan kept telling Lily things, like \u201cLily, if you\u2019re looking for the salt, it\u2019s to your right\u201d or \u201cLily, don\u2019t put that there, it\u2019s too close to the edge.\u201d Lily and Paul both told him that while his commentary was somewhat helpful, it was completely unnecessary. Still, Ryan did not stop. \n \nHowever, things became tense when Lily went to go chop vegetables. When she pulled out a knife, Ryan stopped her and asked if he could take over because he didn\u2019t want Lily to \u201churt herself.\u201d Lily said she\u2019d be fine, but Ryan insisted she give him the knife. Finally, Paul got annoyed and told Ryan to stop. Ryan did stop, but he kept hovering over Lily while she was chopping. \n\nI asked Ryan to sit down until dinner was ready, but Ryan insisted that he just wanted to help. Finally, Lily asked him and I to help set the table and greet people arriving. We did, but things were still tense. \n\nI did pull Ryan to the side and reminded him again to only help Lily if she asked for it. He agreed, but I could tell that he was still upset. \n\nEverything finally boiled over after dinner. My nieces (5 & 3) have a game they love to play with their mother. They will hand Lily something, and Lily would have to guess what it is. Lily would sometimes make a couple of clearly outrageous guesses (like saying an egg is an elephant or a shoe) to make her daughters laugh. \n\nAfter dinner, the eldest handed Lily the salt shaker. When Lily guessed it was a phone, Ryan piped up and said it was a salt shaker. Lily laughed it off and explained the game to Ryan, but I could see she was annoyed. My niece then handed Lily a coin. When Lily guessed incorrectly, Ryan loudly told Lily it was a coin. This was apparently the last straw for Paul. \n\nPaul demanded that Ryan leave since he clearly couldn\u2019t respect Lily. Ryan insisted that he was trying to be helpful. However, Lily said it was probably best if Ryan and I left. I quickly gathered up our things and managed to convince Ryan to leave. \n\nRyan is currently pissed at me. He said I should have defended him, especially since I knew he was only being helpful. He also insisted that I should have stood up against Paul\u2019s \u201coverreaction\u201d (Ryan\u2019s words). I\u2019m now wondering if I should have defended Ryan.

Ryan may felt he was well-intentioned but he just trampled all over Lily's boundaries and her agency. He may or may not be an AH, but I think this whole thing was definitely concerning enough that you need to figure that out. Lily has lived her whole life pre-Ryan without chopping off her hand or dropping everything on the floor or whatever it was he expected her to do without his \"help.\" He needs to understand how infantilizing and offensive his behavior was even if it was coming from a place of concern. \n\nMaybe ask him how he'd respond if he was behind the wheel and you kept saying \"there's a red light coming up\" and \"there's a car in the lane next to you\" and \"you might want to start braking now.\" It would be irritating at minimum. If he asked you to stop and you refused and said \"I just don't want you to get in a wreck\" and kept it up, then how would he feel? If he isn't able to have the lightbulb over the head moment where he realizes how annoying, then offensive, then hurtful his behavior towards Lily was, then you should move on. For a decent person, this will click and they'll want to apologize and it will not be an issue again. For an AH they'll double down or say it isn't the same. You need to figure out which he is.", "YTA but hear me out.  Even considering sticking up for Ryan makes you an asshole by proxy.  He wasn't being helpful in any way, and it sounds like you're trying to justify his behavior to us.   When he insisted on taking the knife from Lily, that was your cue to pull him aside and tell him to knock it the fuck off or leave the party.  Ruining a child's game is just so far beyond the pale, if I had been in your position, he would have been leaving the party alone.", "NTA, he was blindsplaining to a blind person, lol.

He is the type of guy who would give a coworker money for their rent or buy groceries for our neighbor. However, he can take it too far at times. He often tries to help people without asking if they need or want his help. \n\nEvery year, my brother (35M), Paul, and his wife (33F), Lily, host a holiday dinner. This year Ryan attended for the first time. Before we left for their house, I told Ryan that Lily was legally blind and had been her entire life. She knew what she could and could not do. I told Ryan to only help Lily if she asked for help.\n\nWe arrived early so I could help Paul and Lily cook. While we were cooking, Ryan kept telling Lily things, like \u201cLily, if you\u2019re looking for the salt, it\u2019s to your right\u201d or \u201cLily, don\u2019t put that there, it\u2019s too close to the edge.\u201d Lily and Paul both told him that while his commentary was somewhat helpful, it was completely unnecessary. Still, Ryan did not stop. \n \nHowever, things became tense when Lily went to go chop vegetables. When she pulled out a knife, Ryan stopped her and asked if he could take over because he didn\u2019t want Lily to \u201churt herself.\u201d Lily said she\u2019d be fine, but Ryan insisted she give him the knife. Finally, Paul got annoyed and told Ryan to stop. Ryan did stop, but he kept hovering over Lily while she was chopping. \n\nI asked Ryan to sit down until dinner was ready, but Ryan insisted that he just wanted to help. Finally, Lily asked him and I to help set the table and greet people arriving. We did, but things were still tense. \n\nI did pull Ryan to the side and reminded him again to only help Lily if she asked for it. He agreed, but I could tell that he was still upset. \n\nEverything finally boiled over after dinner. My nieces (5 & 3) have a game they love to play with their mother. They will hand Lily something, and Lily would have to guess what it is. Lily would sometimes make a couple of clearly outrageous guesses (like saying an egg is an elephant or a shoe) to make her daughters laugh. \n\nAfter dinner, the eldest handed Lily the salt shaker. When Lily guessed it was a phone, Ryan piped up and said it was a salt shaker. Lily laughed it off and explained the game to Ryan, but I could see she was annoyed. My niece then handed Lily a coin. When Lily guessed incorrectly, Ryan loudly told Lily it was a coin. This was apparently the last straw for Paul. \n\nPaul demanded that Ryan leave since he clearly couldn\u2019t respect Lily. Ryan insisted that he was trying to be helpful. However, Lily said it was probably best if Ryan and I left. I quickly gathered up our things and managed to convince Ryan to leave. \n\nRyan is currently pissed at me. He said I should have defended him, especially since I knew he was only being helpful. He also insisted that I should have stood up against Paul\u2019s \u201coverreaction\u201d (Ryan\u2019s words). I\u2019m now wondering if I should have defended Ryan.

You gave Ryan clear information about Lily's boundaries. Ryan immediately started pushing those boundaries. When asked to stop, he didn't. Instead, he doubled down.

Genuinely asking- does he fall somewhere on an ADHD or autism spectrum? because sometimes folks on the spec. Who are just NOT GETTING the cues need it explained in a different way so that they know when to catch things.

Explain that repeatedly stepping in her way and taking such things away from her or genuinely acting like she can\u2019t do things makes her feel belittled and is ableist. She\u2019s raised whole children she knows how to cook and do things and the bigger way to help is to let her be independent. \nThis doesn\u2019t make his behavior okay, but would consider looking further into it if this is a frequent occurrence or driven by anxiety/people pleasing or misunderstanding social cues", "YTA for not taking him home earlier, questioning yourself about the \u201coverreaction\u201d, and not immediately calling your brother and sister to apologize on your poor choice of BF.", "I have a hard time knowing when to help and when not to.

Honestly I can't believe you even have to ask. You are not in the wrong at all and that BS of just wanting to help is not helpful when someone has asked multiple times to just not. I would have found it hard not to be a bit rude if he kept this crap up in my house: Get a lot of people telling my blind bf and myself which way to go to navigate at the gym for example, they think it is helpful but it just makes it harder to navigate with the distraction, this is what our canes are for.

Up to you what you do with Ryan if you stay together your going to need to be firmer with him and shut that overbearing \u201chelping\u201d down. My take from what you have said is Ryan has a lot of growing left to do. He must learn to help when asked and not before, he needs learn to listen to those around him, he also needs to learn that differently abled people can and do often take care of themselves  perfectly and his behaviour was ableist.
