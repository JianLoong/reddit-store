He is the type of guy who would give a coworker money for their rent or buy groceries for our neighbor. However, he can take it too far at times. He often tries to help people without asking if they need or want his help. \n\nEvery year, my brother (35M), Paul, and his wife (33F), Lily, host a holiday dinner. This year Ryan attended for the first time. Before we left for their house, I told Ryan that Lily was legally blind and had been her entire life. She knew what she could and could not do. I told Ryan to only help Lily if she asked for help.\n\nWe arrived early so I could help Paul and Lily cook. While we were cooking, Ryan kept telling Lily things, like \u201cLily, if you\u2019re looking for the salt, it\u2019s to your right\u201d or \u201cLily, don\u2019t put that there, it\u2019s too close to the edge.\u201d Lily and Paul both told him that while his commentary was somewhat helpful, it was completely unnecessary. Still, Ryan did not stop. \n \nHowever, things became tense when Lily went to go chop vegetables. When she pulled out a knife, Ryan stopped her and asked if he could take over because he didn\u2019t want Lily to \u201churt herself.\u201d Lily said she\u2019d be fine, but Ryan insisted she give him the knife. Finally, Paul got annoyed and told Ryan to stop. Ryan did stop, but he kept hovering over Lily while she was chopping. \n\nI asked Ryan to sit down until dinner was ready, but Ryan insisted that he just wanted to help. Finally, Lily asked him and I to help set the table and greet people arriving. We did, but things were still tense. \n\nI did pull Ryan to the side and reminded him again to only help Lily if she asked for it. He agreed, but I could tell that he was still upset. \n\nEverything finally boiled over after dinner. My nieces (5 & 3) have a game they love to play with their mother. They will hand Lily something, and Lily would have to guess what it is. Lily would sometimes make a couple of clearly outrageous guesses (like saying an egg is an elephant or a shoe) to make her daughters laugh. \n\nAfter dinner, the eldest handed Lily the salt shaker. When Lily guessed it was a phone, Ryan piped up and said it was a salt shaker. Lily laughed it off and explained the game to Ryan, but I could see she was annoyed. My niece then handed Lily a coin. When Lily guessed incorrectly, Ryan loudly told Lily it was a coin. This was apparently the last straw for Paul. \n\nPaul demanded that Ryan leave since he clearly couldn\u2019t respect Lily. Ryan insisted that he was trying to be helpful. However, Lily said it was probably best if Ryan and I left. I quickly gathered up our things and managed to convince Ryan to leave. \n\nRyan is currently pissed at me. He said I should have defended him, especially since I knew he was only being helpful. He also insisted that I should have stood up against Paul\u2019s \u201coverreaction\u201d (Ryan\u2019s words). I\u2019m now wondering if I should have defended Ryan.

Ryan may felt he was well-intentioned but he just trampled all over Lily's boundaries and her agency. He may or may not be an AH, but I think this whole thing was definitely concerning enough that you need to figure that out. Lily has lived her whole life pre-Ryan without chopping off her hand or dropping everything on the floor or whatever it was he expected her to do without his \"help.\" He needs to understand how infantilizing and offensive his behavior was even if it was coming from a place of concern. \n\nMaybe ask him how he'd respond if he was behind the wheel and you kept saying \"there's a red light coming up\" and \"there's a car in the lane next to you\" and \"you might want to start braking now.\" It would be irritating at minimum. If he asked you to stop and you refused and said \"I just don't want you to get in a wreck\" and kept it up, then how would he feel? If he isn't able to have the lightbulb over the head moment where he realizes how annoying, then offensive, then hurtful his behavior towards Lily was, then you should move on. For a decent person, this will click and they'll want to apologize and it will not be an issue again. For an AH they'll double down or say it isn't the same. You need to figure out which he is.", "YTA but hear me out.  Even considering sticking up for Ryan makes you an asshole by proxy.  He wasn't being helpful in any way, and it sounds like you're trying to justify his behavior to us.   When he insisted on taking the knife from Lily, that was your cue to pull him aside and tell him to knock it the fuck off or leave the party.  Ruining a child's game is just so far beyond the pale, if I had been in your position, he would have been leaving the party alone.", "NTA, he was blindsplaining to a blind person, lol.

He is the type of guy who would give a coworker money for their rent or buy groceries for our neighbor. However, he can take it too far at times. He often tries to help people without asking if they need or want his help. \n\nEvery year, my brother (35M), Paul, and his wife (33F), Lily, host a holiday dinner. This year Ryan attended for the first time. Before we left for their house, I told Ryan that Lily was legally blind and had been her entire life. She knew what she could and could not do. I told Ryan to only help Lily if she asked for help.\n\nWe arrived early so I could help Paul and Lily cook. While we were cooking, Ryan kept telling Lily things, like \u201cLily, if you\u2019re looking for the salt, it\u2019s to your right\u201d or \u201cLily, don\u2019t put that there, it\u2019s too close to the edge.\u201d Lily and Paul both told him that while his commentary was somewhat helpful, it was completely unnecessary. Still, Ryan did not stop. \n \nHowever, things became tense when Lily went to go chop vegetables. When she pulled out a knife, Ryan stopped her and asked if he could take over because he didn\u2019t want Lily to \u201churt herself.\u201d Lily said she\u2019d be fine, but Ryan insisted she give him the knife. Finally, Paul got annoyed and told Ryan to stop. Ryan did stop, but he kept hovering over Lily while she was chopping. \n\nI asked Ryan to sit down until dinner was ready, but Ryan insisted that he just wanted to help. Finally, Lily asked him and I to help set the table and greet people arriving. We did, but things were still tense. \n\nI did pull Ryan to the side and reminded him again to only help Lily if she asked for it. He agreed, but I could tell that he was still upset. \n\nEverything finally boiled over after dinner. My nieces (5 & 3) have a game they love to play with their mother. They will hand Lily something, and Lily would have to guess what it is. Lily would sometimes make a couple of clearly outrageous guesses (like saying an egg is an elephant or a shoe) to make her daughters laugh. \n\nAfter dinner, the eldest handed Lily the salt shaker.

When Lily guessed incorrectly, Ryan loudly told Lily it was a coin. This was apparently the last straw for Paul. \n\nPaul demanded that Ryan leave since he clearly couldn\u2019t respect Lily. Ryan insisted that he was trying to be helpful. However, Lily said it was probably best if Ryan and I left. I quickly gathered up our things and managed to convince Ryan to leave. \n\nRyan is currently pissed at me. He said I should have defended him, especially since I knew he was only being helpful. He also insisted that I should have stood up against Paul\u2019s \u201coverreaction\u201d (Ryan\u2019s words). I\u2019m now wondering if I should have defended Ryan.

Even more so you told him do not try help unless she asks you to and hellloo you ignored me and got upset because you offended not just me but my brother, his wife and also their children and wondered why they asked you to leave \n\nAlso say if he continues that behavior on any visits he won't be welcome to visit them first impressions count and he blew his so badly with your family period.

If someone said, \u201cyou go ahead,\u201d he would respond with, \u201cno, you go ahead.\u201d If this exchange was reversed, he always followed up with, \u201cI insist, you go ahead.\u201d This routinely solicited a huff or eye roll from the other party (myself included). This guy was actually not generally controlling towards others. Rather, he was incapable of adapting his parents\u2019 guidance to unique situations.\n\nYour boyfriend might have control issues. Alternatively, he could have poor situational awareness. Either way, your family is right that his behavior is inappropriate.", "Ryan needs to be told that as an adult, he learns more nuanced things like \"be ready to lend a helping hand\" means \"only when you are explicitly asked, after you've been told six times to only help when you are asked.\"\n\nHis upbringing is no excuse for how he acted. If he were my boyfriend I would be so embarrassed at how he forced himself on your SIL like that.", "One way to help is to stay out of the way.", "Ah. The biggest non takers of the word \"no\". \nKnow that you're NTA for not defending him. His idea of helping is by forcing his ways on to people without their consent. He is TA though.", "NTA. Your bf was. It\u2019s like he equated sil\u2019s lack of sight with lack of brains. For him to seriously believe that she doesn\u2019t know coins and salt shakers from phones and shoes makes me question his mental capacity, or limitations or whatever.", "Dude has a hero complex.", "Some people derive their self worth from helping/providing things for others. So when someone rejects your help it can feel like a personal attack. He really should go to therapy and try and analyze why he was so unwilling to back off\u2026 Or he\u2019s just an asshole \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It really is. That's why there's codependents anonymous.", "\ud83d\ude02 literally my \"friend\" after trying to sabotage my relationship by lying multiple times and getting caught out", "I see you've met my mother", "Yay, marinara lives! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "This is the kind of comment that makes me want to check comment history to see if there's any more gold in there.\n\nGod*damn!*", "This thread is legally on fire. And In a good way", "It could be a million and he likely wouldn't stop because his \"helping\" is of the kind I know better than you what you need. It is the most toxic type of help to disabled people myself included.", "Can we talk about how this guy couldn\u2019t figure out that Lily was kidding around during the game? FFS, that\u2019s pretty obtuse", "Snuck in the all men play there I see", "\ud83d\ude02", "Yep, as someone on the spectrum who enjoys helping others but usually knows where the line is, my first thought was ASD.", "I could more easily see it morphing into Munchhausen by proxy. Gotta be seen to be helping someone at all times, after all...", "And note how even during the game Lily was playing with her children, Ryan had to refocus everyone's attention on HIM. He doesn't want to help. He wants to be the center of attention. Being *seen* to be helping others is just an attention-getting tactic that has worked for him his whole life.", "Gosh I loved the original marinara post, was so funny!", "I\u2019m just feeling real petty today lol", "Funny, I didn't see a reference to \"all men\"... Have you had your eyes checked recently?", "I'm autistic and noted first that the rule was stated before they even arrived. He ignored the rule again and again. \n\nAn ableist and infantilizing savior complex is repulsive regardless of neurotype.", "Probably, but not necessarily. If they grew up in a home where they were expected to be a mind reader, they could've learned that those simple instructions are actually traps. It can be hard to unlearn that.\n\nI think in the case of OP though, that Ryan is just a control freak. Also ableist, and jury is still out on misogynist.", "Generally I'm not cynical but I do watch way too much true crime.  Search Gypsy Rose and Dee Dee Blanchard.", "I noticed that as well. The game solidified what I was feeling the entire time I was reading OP's post. Lily was making it obvious that she was playing with her kids. There was zero need for help.", "Me too! Marinara means red and Alfredo means white... I just about hyperventilated!", "God miss those jokes. Sometimes this sub has the best injokes", "He was told before, during and after the dinner. Read the post again slowly."]}
