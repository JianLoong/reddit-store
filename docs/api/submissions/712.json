AITA isn't appropriate for you here because one or both of you will be painted as the bad guy, when you've been together for ages and have obviously worked through some very rough stuff with children with special needs. \n\nDo you love your partner? Do they love you? Do you think you can work through this with some help? If so, then good luck to you, I hope your partner feels better soon for both your sakes.\n\nEdit: NAH.", "Based on this info, YTA-I understand that you\u2019re frustrated that most of the housework and childcare is falling on you when they\u2019re unwell, but that\u2019s what a true partnership is. \n\nBeing angry and resentful that someone is sick is kind of pointless. Also, while you push forward when you don\u2019t feel well, you may not have to. Maybe have a conversation with your partner when she\u2019s better about wanting to be able to rest the same way she does when you\u2019re sick.\n\nBut yeah, at this point, you sound like you\u2019re mad she rests when she\u2019s sick which is what she\u2019s supposed to do. And the fact that so much falls on her to the point that you\u2019re so frustrated at this apparent \u201cfrailness\u201d to me points to the fact that she\u2019s carrying a heavier load in the relationship day-to-day. Maybe she shuts down because she works herself to exhaustion with the family? Either way, this isn\u2019t an issue for you to resent her for", "NTA \n\nIt's not like you are neglecting them, you're just not babying them."]}
