I'll try to keep it brief\n\nAbout 6 months ago I started working for a new company, fixing printers and computers. I loved the idea of the job when I interviewed for it, so I made the mistake of accepting a 6 month trial period during which I would be paid less than minimum wage, which seemed fair to me as I didn't have any experience on the job and would have to be trained from scratch.\n\nOne of my jobs has been taking care of the small warehouse we have in the back, keeping stock of all the various printers, pc, parts, and other consumables we may have. For this I've made two automated excel sheets which work really well for everything we need. I've also sorted out the warehouse a couple of times since everyone in this company is very messy and just throws things around. They use the excuse that there's only 5 of us atm and they're too busy to keep everything in order.\n\nHere's the thing though, now that I've sorted the warehouse and made the spreadsheet, my boss has informed me that it's unlikely that I will keep working for the company past my trial period. They pretty much used one incident as an excuse to say that I don't do enough work (two printers sat in the warehouse for a month without me fixing them because I kept getting other work/didnt know how to tackle the problem.)\n\nThis really pissed me off, it feels to me like they just hired me to do all the work they couldn't/didn't want to do and now they're getting rid of me.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I deleted my stock worksheet after I leave? I know for a fact that if I do, no one will be able to do it as well, and even if they try it will take them days to take stock of everything that we have. It seems like an asshole move, but the way they've treated me in the past month since they made this decision makes me not feel bad at all\n\n\nEdit: Didn't expect so many responses. Thank you everyone for the insight.\nTo answer a couple of questions, yes these worksheets were created during work on work equipment. I'm not entirely sure what the law on deleting company files in my country (Italy) is but I guess it's better to be safe.\nAnd to answer the questions about my pay, in my country it's completely legal to hire a young worker and pay him less than minimum wage under the guise of \"training\" them.\n\nUnfortunately I was dealt a bad hand and have to deal with the consequences. I'll just take my training and knowledge of how these kind of companies treat people and try to apply it to my next job.", "created_utc": 1684142620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i33vf/wibta_if_i_deleted_all_my_worksheets_after/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
