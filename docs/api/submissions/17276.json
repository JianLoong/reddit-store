I'll try to keep it brief\n\nAbout 6 months ago I started working for a new company, fixing printers and computers. I loved the idea of the job when I interviewed for it, so I made the mistake of accepting a 6 month trial period during which I would be paid less than minimum wage, which seemed fair to me as I didn't have any experience on the job and would have to be trained from scratch.\n\nOne of my jobs has been taking care of the small warehouse we have in the back, keeping stock of all the various printers, pc, parts, and other consumables we may have. For this I've made two automated excel sheets which work really well for everything we need. I've also sorted out the warehouse a couple of times since everyone in this company is very messy and just throws things around. They use the excuse that there's only 5 of us atm and they're too busy to keep everything in order.\n\nHere's the thing though, now that I've sorted the warehouse and made the spreadsheet, my boss has informed me that it's unlikely that I will keep working for the company past my trial period. They pretty much used one incident as an excuse to say that I don't do enough work (two printers sat in the warehouse for a month without me fixing them because I kept getting other work/didnt know how to tackle the problem.)\n\nThis really pissed me off, it feels to me like they just hired me to do all the work they couldn't/didn't want to do and now they're getting rid of me.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I deleted my stock worksheet after I leave? I know for a fact that if I do, no one will be able to do it as well, and even if they try it will take them days to take stock of everything that we have. It seems like an asshole move, but the way they've treated me in the past month since they made this decision makes me not feel bad at all\n\n\nEdit: Didn't expect so many responses. Thank you everyone for the insight.\nTo answer a couple of questions, yes these worksheets were created during work on work equipment. I'm not entirely sure what the law on deleting company files in my country (Italy) is but I guess it's better to be safe.\nAnd to answer the questions about my pay, in my country it's completely legal to hire a young worker and pay him less than minimum wage under the guise of \"training\" them.\n\nUnfortunately I was dealt a bad hand and have to deal with the consequences. I'll just take my training and knowledge of how these kind of companies treat people and try to apply it to my next job.", "created_utc": 1684142620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i33vf/wibta_if_i_deleted_all_my_worksheets_after/", "score": 739, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Often, when companies fire an employee, they clear the personal drive automatically after a set period. This way, either they don't pick up on the file being a shortcut and losing the file is on them, or they pick up on it, copy the file across (always use 'Save As', friends, unless you like having to clean up your formulas!) and eff up the formulas. Either way, you did nothing wrong (or illegal) and they messed things up themselves. \n\nI did this at a job I knew I was going to get fired from: as soon as I knew it could go south, I copied a key file into my personal drive. Nobody cared to realise I used a template file for generating a daily report (my first manager had praised me for coming up with the solution which cut down the time needed to generate a report from one hour each day to 10 minutes). I knew how to update the formulas - one of the production managers did realise that the file picked up the numbers from another report but didn't ask me about it because 'it's her report, she manages the numbers'.\n\nThe inevitable happens and I'm fired and put on gardening leave effective immediately - as in I need to be outside the building in 10 minutes max. I ask if I can check my personal drive for personal files and if I may email them to myself but that is, reasonably I concur, denied. Instead my supervisor (who is the one who orchestrated my dismissal) tells me she wants to see me *delete everything from my personal drive*. \ud83d\ude43 okay miss, I will delete every last file!\n\nI heard from the security guard, who's a solid guy I got along with really well, that the daily meetings revolving around my report mysteriously stopped the next day.  My supervisor had been chewed out - apparently she was supposed to meet with me prior to my dismissal to do handover *specifically* regarding that meeting as it involved production management and stock management staff who relied on those figures to direct factory staff... but she wanted me gone sooner rather than later.\n\nI saw an advert for that job go up the day after my gardening leave was up. And then again two weeks later. And again and again until a year ago. Guess they finally managed to fob off that supervisor to another location. I'd like to imagine she'd done enough damage dismissing me and then being the reason no one would fill my position.", "Do not delete them after you leave. \"Update\" them now, maybe implement some new, untested features.
