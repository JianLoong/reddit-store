She'll be even more upset knowing you deliberately kept this from her.", "YTA. She deserves to know her son died.", "You should probably tell your mom one of her children died.", "YTA - Your mom needs to know her son passed away. If you are worried about her reaction you could always send her a text or email but she needs to know.", "Wtf!?! Yta. Tell your mother her son died!", "Not judging anyone who had a dysfunctional family life and then just lost a family member they were caring for.  Maybe you can pass word on to your mother through another relative or friend if you arent on speaking terms, but she probably should know.  Hoping you can find peace.", "NTA, but your mother does deserve to know that her son is dead. You should definitely let her know sooner rather than later.

He is being treated but has been told he cannot be cured. He found out five or six years ago. His mother was in her nineties. He chose not to tell her. (She was in her right mind when he was diagnosed.) \n\nBecause of both his personality and health, I was often the one who did what my husband would have done under normal circumstances. (Sometimes it was hell when she would talk about serious health issues of others and I could not tell her about her son.) It was the right decision. She passed without having to know and was protected from the worry.", "You're NTA because I'm sure you have your reasons. But please. Tell her. Email her or text her or ask a friend or relative to tell her if you don't want to talk to her yourself.", "I\u2019m having a hard time blaming you for being angry about your parentification and forced caregiver status and for not wanting to include the person who dumped all of her responsibilities as actual parent on you. I think you deserve to be angry and that having these feelings don\u2019t make you an AH.\n\n\nWith that said, there is freedom in truth. Once you tell your mother, there is literally nothing left tying you together and you can drop the rope once and for all and move on. By not telling her, you are letting her live in your mind, rent free, while you marinate in your feelings generated by this \u201cpunishment\u201d of her.\n\nSo I ask you, why do you want to keep this connection? And is it really the best quality self care to make your brother\u2019s death a secret? Now is the time to put yourself first and prioritize caring for your mental health. If you can find a therapist or grief counselor, now is the time.\n\n\nGood luck, I hope you finally find space for yourself.", "NTA. Your mother showed exactly how much she cared about your brother when she abandoned him. You should not have been forced into the role of caretaker for your brother, especially at such a young age.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and for the hardships you endured. You and your brother deserved better.", "NTA at all. If she didn\u2019t want to be involved in his life I can\u2019t imagine why she thinks she deserves to be involved when he dies. She foisted him on you (I have NO idea why you agreed to that against your will) presumably so she could be free of him. Well, now she is.", "I'm so sorry for your loss.

Did she fully abandon you both etc", "Not going to judge because there\u2019s trauma here but you should tell your mother", "Tell her.", "YTA. Imagine how you would feel if someone kept the news your child died from you.

I'm not sure about the full scope of your relationship so I'm making a few assumptions here, but it's sounds like you two are playing this weird petty game with your innocent brother being in the center of things when *now isn't the time*.

Just... send off a letter, or something. You can refuse absolutely any contact that they extend to you. Call the police if they show up at your house.  \n\n\nBut they deserve to at least *know.*", "A very gentle YTA. She should know her son died, but I totally understand not wanting to reopen contact with her. Is there someone you could have reach out to her and let her know instead of you?", "YTA, you need to find a way to inform her.

You seem to have your mind made up, and that\u2019s okay, but it feels like you\u2019re just here to be bashed or validated. Your family dynamic isn\u2019t something you can explain in a single post, and there\u2019s no answer any one person can give without making assumptions about someone involved here. \n\nGrief is an awful thing, and not something for us to judge here. I am so, so sorry for your loss. I wish you the best.", "Yta just two words and is everything", "You should tell her", "ESH. Your mom was wrong to put your brothers care on to you. It wasn't fair and it wasn't right. But you should tell her that he died. You should have told her right away. I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry you had awful parents, but telling her that he died is the right thing to do.", "YTA You have to tell her. You can't seriously think you can withhold that information from her", "YTA this is so seriously messed up.\n\nIf I was dating you and found out you did this then I would break up immediately.  If I was interviewing you for a job and found this out about you, I would remove you from consideration.  If i was a friend I would distance myself from you.\n\nI consider that psychopathic behaviour.  Not in the medical sense since I can\u2019t diagnose you, but in the social language sense.", "Info\n\nWhat would your brother want?\n\nPersonally I'd tell her, set up a new email send it from that and never log in again (I would add in the email that I wouldn't be respoi)", "Yes. Tell her.", "Not passing judgement because dysfunctional families are wrought with enough crap that there rarely is a right or wrong way to deal with stuff.\n\nI will say that my estranged sibling passed, my mom has early-onset dementia, and we (me and other siblings) talked with her nurses about whether we should tell mom and the nurses all said that she absolutely had the right to know one of her children had died.\n\nIs there a way to pass the info onto another relative or friend so they can get the news to your mom?", "NTA\n\nIf your mother cared, she would have stayed in touch. I can't blame you for not wanting to initiate the contact.", "YTA. Regardless of what happened in the past, your mother has the right to know about the death of her son.", "I am sorry for your losses. I hope you are seeing a counselor: there is so much to work through here. Tell your mother, it will be another burden you can let go of.", "NTA.  Everyone who is saying \"poor mom\" is missing the fact that if your mom was actually involved in your brothers life and his care she would already know he was dead. She clearly abdicated her parental duties to you and walked away.  She doesn't deserve anything.", "NTA.

Just FYI her. If she knew 6 months back it was coming.", "YTA and one of the bigest AH possible.\n\nit's her child .", "No judgement as family dynamics can be weird and fucked up.  However, I would recommend telling her sooner rather than later.

Was there so little contact that she wouldn't notice he died?", "NAH. I'm not sure anyone can lay blame in a situation like this when everything has gone so wrong for everyone involved. I do think the sooner you tell your mother, the better. I've been in this situation with the death of a close relative and it *hurt* that the people involved in the dispute couldn't put it aside for the sake of the deceased. I never got to grieve properly and that hurts terribly.", "YTA. Tell her that her son is dead. She deserves to know", "Poor mom? She abandoned one dying child to force the other one to take care of him and then didn't contact anyone for weeks! Like, did people even read past the title here?", "She knew he was dying and passed the responsibility 100% onto her other child and walked away. She doesn't deserve to know anything about either of her children.", "This seems to be almost the reason the papers publish death notices. I kind of feel like there's almost an obligation to tell the mother one of her children has passed away, but I'm old enough to recognise that's not always appropriate to do personally."]}
