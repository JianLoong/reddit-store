I used to be one of those people who misjudged them and now I eat all the words I used to say about teachers in the past. I will continue to spread the word about teachers & why there's a teacher shortage. They are the MVPs and extremely unappreciated! You're the one working from home and trust me when I say even the worst work from home jobs is still lower energy than being \"on\" all the time as a teacher. If she works during summer & winter break, trust me her performance during the academic year as a teacher will suffer. Admins are not as generous as they used to be in the past... I've seen Admin fire veteran teachers left & right the minute their performance drops. Teaching no longer has the job security like it used to in the past. \n\nIf the part-time job your brother gave you is not enough, go find another higher paying part-time job or better yet start looking into overemployment.

You deserve that too.", "**NTA**\n\n**Her excuse is not valid.**\n\nAre there high crime rates in this *richer school? Gangs, drugs, prostitution, physical intimidation, guns, low graduation rates?* I get school shootings has increased anxiety but seriously compared to inner-city schools across the country (have lowest graduation rates) is it that bad? Not really. I can speak as worked with kids from poor schools & their attitudes. Rich kids & their parents can be handful, annoying & disrespectful but don't come in to beat up a teacher cause son got expelled for missing class or beat up a kid. ***And she needs a few months to recover? NOPE! Unrealistic.***\n\nCertain public schools such as NYC don't have full summers (3 months for some & little under 2 months for others). They leave school near the end of June & start up in August.\n\n***Teachers out of love or for the extra $ work various hustles school related.***\n\nMy uncle was a teacher. He also was the jr. high football coach & HS assistant, HS track coach (leading several teams to state championships). During the summers was the head of the recreational departmental at the local baseball, swimming & exercise community fields. He also managed to earn an MBA (upped his salary). All the while he had 4 mouths to feed with a SAHM & mortgage for a 5-bedroom/4-bathroom house.\n\nI was involved in an activity (senior drum corps) that many music teachers/band directors took part in. They practiced on weekends during the fall & winter then marched during the summer. I know particularly of music teachers that ran the programs for junior drum corps putting in a lot of hours then traveling the country doing it.\n\nWhat about the summer camps many teachers run & participate in as counselors?\n\n**Tutoring?**\n\n***OMG! That's a cash cow!*** Wealthy & upper middle-class families are pushing their kids to get into Ivy league schools & comparable high-ranking colleges. They hire teachers to tutor on the tough subjects (math, physics, sciences along with English) year-round or only during the summers. Why? To help them ace & keep their academic GPAs up preparing for admission screenings. They even have tutors to help them with their college essay applications.\n\n***Excuse me, THEY PAY MORE THAN A SIDE JOB!!! They're rich can afford it and wanting the best for their kids to get into pristine colleges which gets them easily to the rich life.*** How do I know? Job was to drive these kids independently to their tutors, or, the tutors to the families. Cost of driving them monthly was around $1,000. If I'm getting paid that, what's the tutor getting paid?\n\n***You guys are now planning on living in the rich area, and you don't know that? Wife's not telling you certain agencies advertise on their teacher lounge boards and, contact them directly through email for such contracting jobs. Little thing, failed to mention to you. Many teachers talk about it as a group their plans for the summer recommending which agencies pay the best & who's the worst to work for.***\n\n***What's wife doing during the summer? Eating bon-bons & lounging at a pool or on the couch watching soap operas recovering from the trauma of school? BS!***\n\n***Both of your lives aren't getting better moving out.***\n\nNeed to review your entire budget & research options. From renting, cost of living, commuting & considering all options of where should live.\n\nEven if is an hour, whether in wrong direction at moment, it can save a lot. People commute into NYC from PA & NJ. Lower taxes & big bang for the dollar. Instead of an apartment, the costs of that apartment can be a house in those areas. CT has lower costs in some areas compared to NY. However, the further away the less the cost of living. Wherever there's the rich, there's a *supporting* town of maids, teachers & other support staff. Looking around N, S, E & W to see where the supporting towns are. Example, Greenwich CT & Rye NY are high-end rich areas, Port Chester is sandwiched in-between.\n\nI lived in a high cost of living areas near NYC. When moved, I was a country bumpkin didn't know anything. Moved to expensive cost of living areas, looking up rentals using Craig's listings & paid real estate agencies. \n\nMy rent last lived was a 5 room 1-bedroom apartment $1,800/month with electric (& heat) at $600. That was a steal! Because I used my camera & whenever saw apartment complexes advertising vacancies, used camera & snapped the info later calling them & found this gem.\n\nMy friend lived in the City her rent on 3-room studio/jr bedroom was $2,600 with all utilities extra (garbage, sewage, water, electricity & heat (gas). I'm assuming it's over $3,600/month.\n\nA few years before, another friend (former roommate), *scouted the area* interested wanted to live in. She went & looked at the plaque next to entrances informing who the managing leasing agents were & called them directly. She happened to find an apartment the long-term tenant had died & were processing everything. It was a 5-room 1-bedroom apartment on the Hudson River with a balcony overlooking it. Her rent? $900/month. $900 less than me & her utilities? $60/month because of it being over the county from NYC boros. That's what inspired me to snap pics of whatever I saw in my travels then call.\n\n***Move or stay?***\n\nThere are areas that are much cheaper & many have to make a decision is it worth the long-term struggle? Living in the area for the fringe benefits? Or, able to pay bills without worry & save up for a house, vacation, car and/or retirement?\n\nThere are families that the kids use the bedroom & the parents sleep in the living room as can't afford a 2\u20133-bedroom apartment let alone a house!\n\nPeople who live in San Franciso even earning a 6-figure income are struggling to find affordable housing. Some commute for hours to work in the surrounding areas. Living in NC or Vermont may be better to afford one's income.\n\n**Health benefits?**\n\n***It's going to make you sicker than you are & it's not worth it. Once robbed of health can't get it back.***\n\n***Medical benefits don't come with the job?*** \n\nIs this a private religious school or one not in the US? Because they sometimes don't offer medical benefits and if do may not cover same sex. Public they do have medical, retirement benefits & if in US credit union loans.", "NTA, she needs to work.
