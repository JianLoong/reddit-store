Wow. Trust me, I'm coming from Corporate America and worked 2 remote jobs. One of the remote jobs worked me from 6am to 2am. And damn, teaching makes all those prior jobs look like a piece of cake.

I ended up getting a health issue BECAUSE of the teaching job. \n\nPeople really misjudge teachers and the work-life balance they have. I used to be one of those people who misjudged them and now I eat all the words I used to say about teachers in the past. I will continue to spread the word about teachers & why there's a teacher shortage. They are the MVPs and extremely unappreciated! You're the one working from home and trust me when I say even the worst work from home jobs is still lower energy than being \"on\" all the time as a teacher. If she works during summer & winter break, trust me her performance during the academic year as a teacher will suffer. Admins are not as generous as they used to be in the past... I've seen Admin fire veteran teachers left & right the minute their performance drops. Teaching no longer has the job security like it used to in the past. \n\nIf the part-time job your brother gave you is not enough, go find another higher paying part-time job or better yet start looking into overemployment.

You're already busting your butt, and you don't get months off, she could pick up a part time job in the summer, she'd still have plenty of time to herself, but add income to the household. It's not fair of her to expect you to add even more workload.", "NTA. There\u2019s a lot of audacity from your wife here. You\u2019re already going above and beyond. It\u2019s true, teaching is a hard job and draining, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should have to take on the burden of being the one to fill every gap in income. When I was teaching, almost every teacher I knew worked a summer job. While it\u2019s nice to have the summers off, if your household can\u2019t afford for her to have that time off, she shouldn\u2019t take that time off.", "NTA - Nope. You have 3 jobs\u2026.she needs to get a second job\u2026at least during the summer. Btw - I hate how people think that your job is somehow \u201ceasy\u201d if you work from home.", "ESH\n\nLife is not a competition of who has it the worst. You both sound at your wits ends, and claiming the other one doesn't do enough is not helping.\n\nTalk about your priorities. You say you are saving for a downpayment. That's not as if you're going hungry, so you do have a choice.\nTruly, both your mental health is the most important. If moving house can wait, let it. \n\nAll the extra stress and effort you need to put in to achieve that goal right now, may not be worth it. So decide if you can afford it. Not financially, but can you afford the extra strain it'll have on your  mental health?  Will your relationship even survive that?", "NAH. My wife was a teacher for 30 years. Never did fewer than 60-70 hours work a week. Even in the holidays, she was researching, planning, organising etc. \n\nYou are both working very hard, trying to make ends meet. She has a two hour commute as well. It sounds like you both need a financial rethink around your expenses, workload, even your location.", "I\u2019m going with NAH. It\u2019s a fucking disgrace that in your country, you have to hold down 4 jobs between you, working well over 40 hours and still struggling! The whole thing sucks!!!", "ESH\nTeaching is a very draining job. The job doesn't end when the kids go home, nor does it end when you go home so it's very understandable that she doesn't want to give up those small breaks.\nOn the other hand, you OP are working multiple jobs already and your wife should step up at least over the summer to do extra work. Overall it sounds like you guys need to move to a more affordable area and need to go to counseling.", "YTA. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but hear me out. My daughter is a teacher and I see her come home some days with tears. Being a teacher is one of the hardest most underpaid professions. She does need the time off. Perhaps cutting back on certain expenses would help IDK but your wife is doing something that most people would never do.", "NAH \n\nI am so sad when I read stories of people that struggle that much. I don\u2019t understand how the world became a place where two people working can\u2019t afford to have a decent life. How is it okay to have to take a part time job when you already work a full time job ? How it is okay for teacher, who have one of the most important role in society, to work during their break to pay their rent ?? What the hell is this word ??", "Agreed! Maybe tutoring locals or even online would be a great option for her! Or even babysitting kids.", "[removed]", "Why do teachers need their breaks over summer and winter?

If your wife has to be in an unaffordable city for her job then she needs a different job.", "Yes! It's a difficult job so go home and have a bath/glass of wine and relax like most people. But to somehow make this proposal like other jobs aren't also hard...", "My dad with 2 other teachers use to paint houses during summer break too. I didn\u2019t realize teachers painting houses was a thing outside them.", "Teachers work over breaks for school.", "NTA. Your wife doesn\u2019t care about you.

OP\u2019s wife has a 3-week winter vacation every year and every summer off. OP\u2019s wife should look for side work instead of trying to force her wife to work even more which isn\u2019t possible", "I agree with what you\u2019ve said regarding hours, safety and commitment (my aunt had bleach put in her coffee cup).  I also have friends who are teachers who have their pay spread over a 12 month period.  However, those friends ALL have side gigs or summer jobs that are not remotely related to their teaching jobs.  The act of getting outside the teaching field for their jobs during their break is what grounds them and keeps them from burning out.   I think OP is already committed to this relationship by working 3 jobs and wife is not being considerate in the least.  OP is NTA, teaching is highly underpaid but EVERY teacher I know already knew that going into the field.", "One side becomes the asshole when she has literal weeks off while her SO is working FOUR jobs and she wants said SO to take a fifth before she even starts a second lol.", "They can\u2019t move unless the wife gets a new job.

She made an easy $90-100/wk off of us, and it would\u2019ve been more if she\u2019d been available more. Oh, and she also worked(extra pay) the after-school enrichment classes(think archery, baking, other fun shit) our school would offer twice a year, and she also worked a couple of the summer programs that were just fun classes, not actual summer school.

Maybe other people are making the same assumption as me, idk", "I think sometimes schools offer that option but they spread out their income instead lol. It's so messed up. I remember growing up my teacher worked at our local Jcpenny.", "This is more state by state, remembering comments by my mother who taught for 50ish years and my sister who is a current teacher.  Some states pace out paychecks so they keep coming during breaks, others just pay during the school year.\n\nWhich does nothing about the generally underpaid state of public school teachers in the US in general, but -- some do get paid over their breaks.", "> Other option is to move countries to one where teachers actually get paid on breaks??? America is bindblowing, I swear.\n\nWTF do you mean?? Teachers are **not** getting payed over summer break in the US? that's can't be true, is it?", "My thoughts exactly.\n\nSome first world country when teachers need to deliver pizza after school (have met them).", "Come to Australia, honestly. Teachers incomes start at $60k for graduates and cap out at $120k-ish for someone with 12+ years experience. It\u2019s in AUD of course, so the exchange rate counts, but it\u2019s a solidly middle class income compared to our cost of living.", "In the US, they do not get paid for breaks. They can, however, choose to receive their salary at a much lower weekly rate in order have steady income over the summer months.", "Actually, that depends on each state/school district, I think. I know where I live, they have the option to be paid only while school is in session or they can take a bit of a smaller pay check during the school year, but have their pay extended to cover the breaks. \n\nIf teachers make $50k(Yes, I know. Not likely, but work with me.. on this hypothetical), they could choose to get paid 5,555.55 a month for 9 months or they could get paid 4,166.66 a month for 12 months.

OP already does two part time jobs in addition to her full time job.", "Ok, then your wife cannot afford this job, maybe she cannot afford to be a teacher. If she insists she needs breaks to not burn out, so she can't get a second job, and the job she has isn't paying enough of a living wage to be able to live in the area the job is, then the job is unsustainable. One solution is for her to sacrifice her tenure, the both of you to search for an area that is safe and affordable and she finds a job there. The other is for her to find a way to handle a longer commute permanently, and the two of you to accept that you will be living in a not ideal neighborhood. Or you could try a living situation with roommates, because I don't see how you can afford to either buy or rent, when you are having money issues with 2 full-time and 2 part-time jobs between you. The reality is, the two of you cannot afford the life you want, and you need to start compromising.\n\nThe problem here is that your wife isn't compromising at all; she wants to stay at this job she has tenure, she wants to have her breaks free to recharge, she wants a short commute, she wants to live in a nice neighborhood, and she is expecting you to work yourself to death to make it possible for her to live this life she wants.
