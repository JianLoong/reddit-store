Summer is a long time and maybe you guys can come to an agreement that she spends half the summer working and the other off.", "ESH.

People shouldn\u2019t have to work 60+ hours a week just to keep their heads above water. It\u2019s just wrong. You clearly can\u2019t take on more hours. Mathematically she could, but if it genuinely would compromise her mental health it\u2019s not worth it. Instead of resenting each other for not being able to take on more, concentrate on working together to chip away the expenses that don\u2019t serve your lives and your happiness, re-examine plans and goals to pivot away from those that are based on social pressure or economic models that no longer function or exist, and lean on each other in gratitude for the one good thing that shouldn\u2019t have any direct monetary cost, which is a loving partner.", "NTA. Its an unequal distribution of work.", "NAH except for capitalism. \nAlso I feel like some people in the comments need to learn what a teacher's break is (spoiler: it's not all free time) and how people can or can't just \"pick up\" certain jobs.", "YTA! Wow. Trust me, I'm coming from Corporate America and worked 2 remote jobs. One of the remote jobs worked me from 6am to 2am. And damn, teaching makes all those prior jobs look like a piece of cake. There's a reason they give teachers time off and that's because they work them to the bone. Teaching is an exhausting job - long hours, emotional toll, physical toll. I ended up getting a health issue BECAUSE of the teaching job. \n\nPeople really misjudge teachers and the work-life balance they have. I used to be one of those people who misjudged them and now I eat all the words I used to say about teachers in the past. I will continue to spread the word about teachers & why there's a teacher shortage. They are the MVPs and extremely unappreciated! You're the one working from home and trust me when I say even the worst work from home jobs is still lower energy than being \"on\" all the time as a teacher. If she works during summer & winter break, trust me her performance during the academic year as a teacher will suffer. Admins are not as generous as they used to be in the past... I've seen Admin fire veteran teachers left & right the minute their performance drops. Teaching no longer has the job security like it used to in the past. \n\nIf the part-time job your brother gave you is not enough, go find another higher paying part-time job or better yet start looking into overemployment. You do work remotely so you have flexibility to juggle two remote jobs if you wanted. It doesn't have to be two full-time remote jobs. It can be 1 full time and 1 part-time.", "NTA... only because you're married. It's a partnership. If y'all need more money, she needs to work during at least part of the summer.

But I also don't think it's completely unreasonable of your wife to say she can't work either. My mom was a teacher, and I remember her spending breaks writing lesson plans and attending workshops/seminars, and it felt like she was still working even though school was out. \n\nThe real AH is the rising cost of living making it impossible for people like you and your wife to buy a home. Sorry you're both under so much stress, and I wish you the best.", "NAH because really the AHole here is Capitalism \nLike your wife is right to want breaks but also maybe needs to figure out a way to supplement your families income with like tutoring occasionally etc. You\u2019re at a breaking point bc you are def over extended at 65 hrs+ a week. \nI hope y\u2019all figure out away to get past this squeeze.", "*Fourth* job.

I have plenty of teacher friends who work hard and make a decent living but it does not compare to working 1 full time and 2 part time jobs.

We live in a moderate crime area, it does not get the gang shootouts like other parts of the city does but I would also prefer not to buy property here. She also does not want the hour long sometimes two hour long in rush hour commute anymore which I understand. Living closer to her school means also living in a richer area. It is also cheaper to buy than rent in those parts of the city where her school is.", "Sounds like she can't compromise, which is very unfair on you. For me, this is a red flag moment. \n\nMy dad was a high school teacher and also worked security at night when times got tough for us many years back (my mum worked 2 jobs too). Teaching is a stressful job for sure but when shit hits the fan most reasonable people will do whatever they can to fairly pitch in and be a team player.\n\nGood luck with this."]}
