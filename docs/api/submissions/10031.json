The problem is that we live in a compound with my uncle and his family as well.\n\nMy cousin (12F) has caused many issues in the past mostly due to taking our things, exaggerating complaints to her parents, or being entitled. Her parents don't discipline her much.\n\nShe's always been interested in makeup and fashion, and recently she's taken and stretched out two of my tops. I don't have many clothes typically just wear the same 4-5 tops since we have a school uniform. Now two aren't fit to wear out.\n\nEarlier, I was doing my makeup in my bathroom when I heard her walk in. She called my name (maybe checking if I was inside so she wasn't caught stealing) and I replied. She then asked to borrow my flare jeans. I lied that they were in the laundry. I asked to borrow her business pants once and they were far too big, so I knew she wouldn't fit into mine and hoped she'd just find something else to wear.\n\nWhen I came out, she was looking through my closet and found the jeans. This is where I might be the asshole. Instead of lying and saying oh, they must be back from the wash already, I owned up to the lie.\n\nI told her that she'd already stretched out two of my tops, and these were my only non-ripped jeans so I wore them all the time. She has tons of clothes from Shein, and it's not my fault she didn't ask her parents before buying revealing tops and now isn't allowed to wear them out. I told her I'd told her countless times not to take my things without permission and she ignored me every time.\n\nI then told her it wasn't a bad thing that she wasn't skinny, but to stop acting like we were the same size and she could just take my clothes as she pleased.\n\nThis last comment really got to her and she ran out of my room crying. She seems to have told her parents an exaggerated version since they're mad at me for calling her fat and telling her she's ugly because she eats to much (which is a blatant lie, not sure why they think I'd say that). My parents think I was too harsh but that she shouldn't have looked in my closet, and my sister says our cousin had it coming and needed to hear the truth.\n\nI don't think I was fatshaming her, just pointing out that she was a bigger size, but I don't have the experience of being plus size and I did shout at a 12 year old so AITA?", "created_utc": 1676474444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1130fp4/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_she_isnt_skinny/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't care about someone else's feelings if they don't think about mine.  She needs to learn some respect of others things and stuff.", "NTA.\n\nBut, as an older female in her life she may very well emulate (hence wanting to wear your clothes) you would do her a world of good in speaking to her directly and honestly about why you reacted that way, that it was more harsh than you meant it, and that it bothered you a lot she didn't listen to you.\n\nYou can fix this easily, I expect, but you're NTA here in any case.", "NTA.  You say you had asked her countless times and she\u2019d ignored you, in the process ruining your clothes.  Was it nice to say?  No.  Did she push you to the point that seemingly only blunt language would get through to her?  Yes.", "Nta ignore the spoiled brat and stand your ground. Next time her parents rag on you tell them she is a liar and you are fed up with her behavior. Do not apologize. Stand up to her and her parents every time something like this happens.  If you let them walk all over you it will never stop. They need to.kearn you are not an easy target.", "NTA. You should be able to have your clothes and other stuff in peace. \n\nMaybe talk to your parents and tell them this?", "Given the context NTA\n\nBut let's be clear here, very close to a washout because she is 12 but she does sound like a demon of a teenager", "Not the AH, she obviously doesn't respect boundaries, or show any respect for other peoples property, Her parents can get mad all they want but their the reason she acts that way. You should get them all together in the same room and tell the story clearly and show them the stretched out tops you already can't wear any longer thanks to her. Tell them calmly exactly what you said and then recap what she ran and told them.", "NTA - Your wording could have been a little diffrent tho. IF you care for the relationship between you two, it would be best to sort it out.", "You could have said this more friendly. Size and body structure can be different without using words like skinny, or pointing out how she stretched items.\n\nBut ultimately NTA.", "NTA. She was ruining your stuff.", "ESH. She shouldn't take what she wants but you could have merely said \"Don't take my stuff unless you ask me and I say it's okay'. It was unnecessary for you to point out the difference in your sizes. And you come across as sounding superior because you are smaller than her.", "ESH. I think you lost the moral high ground when you said that to a child. I'm not condemning you, I'm sure she's a nightmare, but yeah, I think you already know that was a step too far. You could deal with her nonsense in much more effective ways without becoming the bad guy.", "NTA but your cousin will have body disphoria", "ESH\n\nHow is a 12-year-old purchasing clothes online without her parent\u2019s permission anyway? \n\nI think you could have been assertive without bringing weight into it. What you said to her might have been true but might have also caused unnecessary emotional hurt at an age where she is probably already struggling with her body image and self-confidence.\n\n*\u201dYou do not have my permission to ask for or take any of my clothes.\u201d*\n\nLeave it at that, and if she continues to not listen, then lock up your things and demand replacements from her parents for things taken/ruined.", "ESH.  All you had to say was you are not the same size which can be true of any 2 people - even 2 people of the same aesthetic body type.", "ESH. You didn't tell her that you weren't the same size. You told her that she wasn't skinny. There's a big difference in how those two sentiments are received.\n\nYour cousin sounds like a brat, that might be due to parenting, or it might be due to her age and acting out and pushing boundaries. Either way, implying that she is fat or isn't skinny, causes damage to her self-esteem and confidence, and could lead to more serious problems like eating disorders.", "YTA, she asked to borrow your jeans\u2026 all you had to say was \u201cno, my clothes don\u2019t fit\u201d like the problem is the pants are yours and your size,  but you made the problem your 12 year old cousins body\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The earliest I can remember is taking toys when she was 5, but recently she's taken everything from makeup (including ruining my eyeliner) to sweets when her parents say no to sweets from their pantry. She's never responded to being told not to take my things, and at this point I was so frustrated.\n\nWas there a better way for me to have gotten across to her? I've asked for door locks (my parents disagree with locking bedrooms), even talked to her parents who see no issue since we should all share our things. At this point I didn't know what else to do.", "If you can\u2019t take someone telling you that you are a bigger size then them then loose weight\u2026 not once have I asked my buddy hey can I borrow a pair of pants because I know I won\u2019t fit in his. If I was constantly asking/stealing them I would definitely expect him to tell me to stop", "If you aren't skinny, you aren't skinny? \"Fat shaming\" is being derogatory to someone for being fat. Not for acknowledging that they are overweight. If they cannot acknowledge it, you didn't shame them, they shamed themselves about it and blamed it on you. \"Fat acceptance\" is acknowledging that you are overweight and saying that's fine, and others not making assumptions about your personality because of it. It isn't pretending someone else is the same size as you.", "Sorry my mistake", "Buy locks for your dresser and closet. Demand that her parents replace everything she\u2019s taken/ruined.

I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "Yeah dude you\u2019re fine. She needed a reality check - probably part of the reason she feels like she can act this way is that she has a distorted view of who she is, enough so that you mentioning reality in a non-confrontational way apparently causes significant harm. \n\nIn a more general sense, all the people assuming that talking about weight or size is inherently offensive are defeating their own argument. If it\u2019s okay to be fat, it\u2019s okay to mention that as a reason why someone can\u2019t take your clothes. If it\u2019s not okay to talk about, then there must be something inherently wrong with it right? So which is it?", "Lock up your shit. But you are still wrong for point out the difference in your sizes. That was petty", "You might ask your prents if you can get a latch with a lock on the outsid eof the dooor (not a locking door handle. This way they can have a key and you wont be able to lock it when you are inside the room.", "The weight is the lesser issue here. The 12-year-old seems to be a compulsive thief. That can be addressed without bringing up the weight.", " No problem  I had to re read it myself tbh lol"]}
