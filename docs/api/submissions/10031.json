Weight is a really hard topic to talk about without someone feeling hurt, however, that doesn't mean it can just be ignored - they are your clothes, and she can't take them, regardless of your two sizes.

It certainly wasn't kind.\n\nThe actual issue is that she's sneaking into your room, taking your things without asking, and subsequently ruining them even if accidentally. You're NTA for setting boundaries with regards to your belongings. You're also NTA for confronting her when you catch her red-handed crossing that boundary.\n\nI suggest sitting down with your parents (who seem like reasonable people) and asking them for help. Explain your frustrations, and ask them how they can help you protect your belongings considering this isn't the first or even second time.

You use euphemisms like \"plus size\" but if she is then that's a whole other can of worms, but if she's just bigger, that's different. \n\nTalk to her like she's a human being, not a dog that's been badly trained.

She likely steals your clothes as she looks up to you. Can you ask her parents to have a word with her or put a lock on your bedroom door?

Stick to facts.", "Good point well made i agree. Maybe she wants to think she is like you as she admires you and knows people find you attractive so wishes to emulate this. And was upset as she felt you said this wasnt the case. I know you didnt say she was unattractive but she may feel you did. 12 can be a difficult age i think with the 12 year old being at a stage they push boundaries, tru too assert their independence etc. But in reality are still actually a child. Peace qnd and love to you both.", "Asking someone to protect the feelings of a person old enough to understand it's not ok to take things without permission especially if she ruins them in the process is not good advice.

Leaving it simply at, \"we are not the same size and you stretched out my clothes before,\" keeps the conversation completely factual and protects you if she goes crying to her parents, as well, bc all you did was point out something that was literally the case.", "ESH/NTA and i\u2019ll explain my reasoning:\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong for being upset or for telling her not take your clothes.

You\u2019re allowed to say no to people using your stuff. i think it\u2019s easy to declare her a lot of things bc she sounds spoiled; however, i find it a lot that people think it\u2019s okay to tell plus size people mean things like that bc you see them as gross or deserving it bc of their size. \n\nI think a lot of these comments are exceptionally harsh to be said about a 12 year old. She was born in 2010 you guys. That\u2019s a kid, and she needs to learn but learning a lesson and being punished and made to feel insecure isn\u2019t \u201cjust being honest.\u201d \n\nYou are older and it IS your responsibility to recognise that you did wrong here. (As did she!!) It was a mistake, you were upset, all you can do is move forward now. Explain what happened to her parents and they will probably be mad, but hopefully they will listen. \n\n\u201cTruth\u201d is entirely subjective. the context of this truth is: she\u2019s 12. when i was 12 i was a size 12, by 16 i was a size 2, bodies change all the time at that age and it\u2019s hard! and it hurts! and you\u2019re insecure! we are party of a society that values being thin, especially at that age. if she is bigger than the other girls in her grade, im sure she\u2019s aware of it. your actions don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, this is a bigger sized preteen girl going through puberty and her cool, skinny, pretty older cousin just told her \u201cyou don\u2019t fit in my clothes!\u201d. \n\nAgain, i don\u2019t think you\u2019re THE ass hole, but i do think you need to be aware of the impact of what you did, not the intention you had. \n\nalso tell her parents and maybe see if you can get a lock. she is absolutely spoiled for stealing your things, and again you have every right to tell her to knock it off.\n\nedit: typo, im sure there\u2019s more\n\nedit 2: i think she\u2019s being bratty for lying, but also she\u2019s 12 and maybe what she saying is reflecting how you made her feel and not what you said that doesn\u2019t make it okay to lie, but taking into consideration that\u2019s how she feels about what you said potentially might help going forward\n\nedit 3, because this one is just on my mind: her behaviour needs to change. I agree, but you need to go to her parents and think of a productive and not negative reinforcement style to do this. I\u2019m not saying you should be responsible. I don\u2019t think you should act like her parents by any means, but as it\u2019s your clothes that she\u2019s taking you need to work with her parents to find a solution so she doesn\u2019t become an absolute nightmare. 12 is still really young and it is plenty of time to grow and change and learn from this experience and it\u2019s up to you what sort of relationship you want with your cousin, but if you don\u2019t want an alienated one, I would strongly encourage trying to find a solution that has nothing to do with her size and more to do with the fact that they are /your/ clothes, you are /older/ than her, so she does not have any business wearing your clothing, and that you don\u2019t want her to because they\u2019re /yours/.", "ESH, she is obviously ta for stealing and damaging your clothes but you explicitly brought her weight into it when she's young and probably insecure which was an ahole move.", "NTA.

If she wanted the courtesy of someone considering her feelings she should do the same for others.", "Not entirely the asshole, but you could have handled it better.", "As. \n 2", "You\u2019re NTA but you aren\u2019t off the hook, either. IF you had really said that she needed to stop acting like you were the same size, then you were ok. That was a fact. If you had said that she was fat, then that was being mean. Since she\u2019s accusing you of saying those things about her, obviously she\u2019s thinking of herself as fat and ugly, which is too bad. But she\u2019s still a jerk for taking things without permission.\n\nA 12 year old should NOT be wearing an 18 year old\u2019s clothes. She also shouldn\u2019t be wearing them without permission. You\u2019ve told her to stop and she ignores you. Yelling is not a surprise reaction to finding her pawing through your clothes, though that wasn\u2019t a mature way to handle it. She\u2019s certainly old enough to know better.\n\nThe big thing here is her lack of respecting your things and your boundaries. I don\u2019t know what the arrangement of your home is, but is it possible to lock her out of your room? Since you\u2019ll be moving soon that seems like the easiest way to deal with the problem.", "Dude same. My parents like to take my cord that I have to charge my phone and they never put it back and it bugs me to no end. Though every once in a blue moon my sister might take a sweatshirt (usually for a school thing and she doesn\u2019t have her own that\u2019s in that color or something) but she always either gives it back to me or just leaves it on my bed. Still somewhat annoying but at least she puts it back", "Except that her size is one of the issues. Whilst OP is clearly annoyed by her cousins overall behaviour like taking things without permission and such it is clear that her cousin ruining her clothes by stretching them out is a huge issue for her especially given that she has limited clothing. Seeing as the reason her cousin is stretching out her clothes is because of her size that makes her size an issue. Whilst OP would probably still care about her cousin taking things without asking? It\u2019s clear that she is further annoyed because her size makes her ruin those outfits. It\u2019s unfortunate because this is a 12 year old girl and you don\u2019t want to speak harshly but seeing as her parents don\u2019t discipline her and at 18 OP is still quite young herself the way she spoke to her cousin is completely understandable. It\u2019s annoying but sometimes you have to tell people the harsh truth before they understand", "Frankly I would have removed her from my closet and room. Boundaries.  Tape her verbal abuse or auntie won't believe you.", "Why should that responsibility fall to OP? OP herself is just an 18 year old teenager with minimal clothing who is also trying to complete high school and go to college. The 12 year old cousin has parents and they choose to give their daughter money to spend on clothes without any supervision. When I was 12, yes I did have a say in the clothes my mum bought me but we would always go clothes shopping together. Why can\u2019t the 12 year olds mum do this? What is she busy doing other that coddling her daughter, allowing her to go rampant and encourage bad behaviour? The way OP spoke to her cousin is as good as can be expected. Definitely NTA", "7th grade is plenty old ask any MS teacher, parents can and are blind about their precious", "Do you realize how old a 12 year old is? To put it in perspective, they would be in 7th grade. Do you genuinely believe that a middle schooler is not able to understand not to take things that belong to others? Also, none of that involves \u201cemotional maturity\u201d. Emotional maturity would be regulating emotions and understanding yourself, which doesn\u2019t apply here. \nI agree that 12 year olds can be mean, but that doesn\u2019t mean that OP needs to coddle to any possible self consciousness her cousin might have.", "My niece and nephew have both understood that they aren't allowed to open my bedroom door without a grown-up literally since they learned to walk. Little Dude learned to walk only a few months ago and can't talk very much because his sister is very... take charge... but he still knocked on my door even when my mom was carrying him in here. \n\nI'm sick (genetically) and have a TON of medications in my here and I can't open the safety lids. The kids are well supervised and if one even tried to grab my doorknob a lock would be put on within the hour. \n\nThey have both understood asking permission and personal space and \"not yours\" since age 14 MONTHS. \n\nIs this weird? I don't know. The last kids I was around can now rent their own car and were poorly parented in the first place. \n\nBut if I know 2 babies who understand \"don't take my jeans\" before they can pronounce my name right, 12 is certainly old enough to know better.", "No. When I was able to wear S size I still would not call myself skinny. Because I have big boobs. We don\u2019t know how cousin looks like. But being called \u201cnot skinny\u201d does not automatically means fat. It\u2019s not about being \u201crole model \u201c it\u2019s 13 years old stealing and destroying things. It\u2019s not \u201cone time\u201d. OP was harsh enough. She made her point and wasn\u2019t cruel", "Esh- obviously, your cousin is out of line for taking your things without permission. And I have empathy for your tops being stretched out. My mom used to do this to my tops when I was a teen. I was a C cup, and she was a DDD. My tops were never the same. \n\nBut you could have said it a lot nicer. You said she was not skinny, which definitely gets internalized as you're fat, especially to a teen/preteen. And that's something that will replay in her mind for years to come. Even if you apologize at this point, she will never forget that.", "There's a unique way to talk to young teenage girls. It's rough - even rougher than it was for you at that age.it asks a lot of anybody. Try to be her friend as much as you can.", "She's pathetic this coming from a 300 pound person", "NTA. You didn\u2019t call her fat you just pointed out you weren\u2019t the same size and she has previously ruined your clothing. It\u2019s unacceptable that she was allowed to do so without facing any repercussions. She or really her parents should have replaced those tops or given you money to do so.  I\u2019m not sure if she will learn her lesson but in case she doesn\u2019t could you ask to have a lock put on your closet?", "NTA.  I\u2019d have opened with listen fatso or something worse at this point. When it comes to your clothes the lines already been crossed.", "NTA. You're dealing with a thief and liar, one who's gone out of her way to try to get you in trouble with your parents. Ask your parents for their help keeping her out of your stuff (like locks on doors) because she is not going to stop. You really need your parents' support.", "NTA. And tell her to stop buying shein", "NTA. You should have been nicer about it but she was disrespecting you and is far more in the wrong.", "NTA. You said it as it is. You were spilling facts. If someone was stealing from my closet and they knew they were a whole lot bigger than me I would\u2019ve told them the truth aswell. You said it in a respectful way, her and her entitled a\u015bs can take it however they want. At least you know now she won\u2019t be taking your clothes. Hopefully.", "At age 12 I had large boobs. My hand me down bras no longer fit my mom. My boobs were bigger than all of the women on my mom\u2019s side of the family (who are more like 34C or so) I was wearing probably a 34DD or even larger.  Not everyone pops out the same way or the same size."]}
