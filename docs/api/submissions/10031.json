I say NTA since it wasn\u2019t the first time.", "Not her sister her cousin", "I'd agree, except she's had a long time history of taking things. The earliest I can remember is taking toys when she was 5, but recently she's taken everything from makeup (including ruining my eyeliner) to sweets when her parents say no to sweets from their pantry. She's never responded to being told not to take my things, and at this point I was so frustrated.\n\nWas there a better way for me to have gotten across to her? I've asked for door locks (my parents disagree with locking bedrooms), even talked to her parents who see no issue since we should all share our things. At this point I didn't know what else to do.", "If you can\u2019t take someone telling you that you are a bigger size then them then loose weight\u2026 not once have I asked my buddy hey can I borrow a pair of pants because I know I won\u2019t fit in his. If I was constantly asking/stealing them I would definitely expect him to tell me to stop", "If you aren't skinny, you aren't skinny? \"Fat shaming\" is being derogatory to someone for being fat. Not for acknowledging that they are overweight. If they cannot acknowledge it, you didn't shame them, they shamed themselves about it and blamed it on you. \"Fat acceptance\" is acknowledging that you are overweight and saying that's fine, and others not making assumptions about your personality because of it. It isn't pretending someone else is the same size as you.", "Sorry my mistake", "Buy locks for your dresser and closet. Demand that her parents replace everything she\u2019s taken/ruined. I know she\u2019s only 12 but this is downright theft. It\u2019s really sad that you have to even consider that in the first place. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "Yeah dude you\u2019re fine. She needed a reality check - probably part of the reason she feels like she can act this way is that she has a distorted view of who she is, enough so that you mentioning reality in a non-confrontational way apparently causes significant harm. \n\nIn a more general sense, all the people assuming that talking about weight or size is inherently offensive are defeating their own argument. If it\u2019s okay to be fat, it\u2019s okay to mention that as a reason why someone can\u2019t take your clothes. If it\u2019s not okay to talk about, then there must be something inherently wrong with it right? So which is it?", "Lock up your shit. But you are still wrong for point out the difference in your sizes. That was petty", "You might ask your prents if you can get a latch with a lock on the outsid eof the dooor (not a locking door handle.

That can be addressed without bringing up the weight.", " No problem  I had to re read it myself tbh lol", "As someone who is tall and thin there is nothing wrong with the blunt:  \"My clothes do not fit you.\"  NTA.", "NTA, I had a friend double my weight who used to try that. truth hurts but you don\u2019t want your clothes ruined and stretched out", "NTA\n\nYou have told her to stop several times without mentioning body sizes and she didn\u2019t listen, though, so I imagine this reaction from her is only partially feeling insulted, and the other part is a temper tantrum of sorts just because you said no. \n\nIf she wants a good relationship with you explain to her that you can enjoy fashion together without sharing clothing, and have a thrifting trip as a bonding experience - I\u2019m assuming she has an allowance if she buys SheIn? \n\nIf she only wants your clothing, get a lock for your door.", "NTA. Weight is a really hard topic to talk about without someone feeling hurt, however, that doesn't mean it can just be ignored - they are your clothes, and she can't take them, regardless of your two sizes. It also seems like she is crossing that boundary with your sister too based on her response. \n\nIt seems like really she is lacking an understanding of boundaries and what is shared and what is personal. You should be able to talk to her about that because she is 12, she's old enough to know when she can and cannot do things.", "NTA - you just spoke the truth lmao", "NTA", "NTA she needs to hear it if she is ruining your clothes. I would audiorecord myself next time I was gonna talk or do something like what you did here so later she can't lie on you.", "NTA", "NTA- i hate anyone who asks for clothes.  Why don't you buy something you like? Why do you have to take other's things?  Maybe I'm like this because i hate sharing. Rest assured OP it was not fat shaming you just told her truth how she ruined your clothes.", "NTA. If her feelings were hurt then she shouldn\u2019t be taking other peoples stuff without permission and she needs to learn that no means no abd to quit asking b", "NTA", "You're both TA and NTA. \n\nYTA because her size wasn't the issue here, and didn't need to be brought up to make your point about her behavior being inappropriate. As a plus size person myself who struggled with weight and body issues all my life, your words would have hurt 12 year old me pretty badly. Even if she overreacted on purpose to draw attention away from her misdeed, I can't imagine what you said didn't sting at all. It certainly wasn't kind.\n\nThe actual issue is that she's sneaking into your room, taking your things without asking, and subsequently ruining them even if accidentally. You're NTA for setting boundaries with regards to your belongings. You're also NTA for confronting her when you catch her red-handed crossing that boundary.\n\nI suggest sitting down with your parents (who seem like reasonable people) and asking them for help. Explain your frustrations, and ask them how they can help you protect your belongings considering this isn't the first or even second time. Then ask them for help in mediating a conversation that addresses your cousin's lack of respect for your boundaries and gives you the opportunity to apologize for hurtful comments you made in the moment.", "ESH. No need to mention her weight.", "YTA. A 12 year old is a child in need of correction, not someone to be lied to and insulted. Your first reaction to be honest was the right one, but did you at any point stop and try and consider things from her point of view?\n\n  \nFurthermore, is she really fat though? You use euphemisms like \"plus size\" but if she is then that's a whole other can of worms, but if she's just bigger, that's different. \n\nTalk to her like she's a human being, not a dog that's been badly trained. Sit down with her, tell her you don't feel like she's respecting you with her actions and then if she doesn't respond with respect in return, then the child is the \"asshole\".", "YTA for the way you worded it. You could have said something like 'we're not the same size'. She's at that age where kids feel very self conscious and you also grow fast. You should know that as you're significantly older than her. This is silly kid stuff though, reminds me of bickering with my siblings growing up. She likely steals your clothes as she looks up to you. Can you ask her parents to have a word with her or put a lock on your bedroom door?  She will stop being so annoying when she's older- she's only 12- it's an annoying age.", "NTA", "Why does a 12 y/o have business pants anyway.\n\nNTA differing sizes are differing size", "NTA. I get so mad at people touching my things without asking. Especially when I\u2019ve asked them twice not too. The third time is when everyone is made uncomfortable in the house.

You\u2019re probably her cool older cousin & she looks up to you. \n\nYou could have easily have let her try the jeans on, if she\u2019s really bigger than you they wouldn\u2019t have fit and you could have said, we can\u2019t share clothes because we\u2019re different shapes and ages, my clothes aren\u2019t appropriate for you but I can help you pick some out next time you buy some things. \n\nIt was totally unnecessary to be cruel to a child  when telling her she couldn\u2019t take the jeans and if she\u2019s plus size it\u2019s not like a shirt, you can\u2019t stretch jeans out. They just won\u2019t go on.\n\nI am tall and slim and let\u2019s be real, our struggles to get clothes are all about getting things that look extra amazing or make the most of what we have, a plus size 12 year old is in a totally different boat than us.", "NTA, I had a friend who tried to double my weight. Truth hurts but you don't want your clothes to get ruined and stretched", "Agreed. Stick to facts.", "Good point well made i agree. Maybe she wants to think she is like you as she admires you and knows people find you attractive so wishes to emulate this. And was upset as she felt you said this wasnt the case. I know you didnt say she was unattractive but she may feel you did. 12 can be a difficult age i think with the 12 year old being at a stage they push boundaries, tru too assert their independence etc. But in reality are still actually a child. Peace qnd and love to you both.", "Asking someone to protect the feelings of a person old enough to understand it's not ok to take things without permission especially if she ruins them in the process is not good advice. The cousin then outright lied to OP's parents. This kid knows what she is doing is wrong. Protecting her precious feelings while she acts this way isn't going to help the situation. The cousin needs to learn that she can't keep acting this way without there being consequences.", "\u201cWe are not the same size. Stop taking my clothes.\u201d", "When you are 12, generally you don't buy your own clothes, your parents buy your clothes.
