In middle school i was excluded and treated really harshly by my fellow classmates. I lived in a predominantly asian area and am asian myself, but i was never seen as \u201casian enough\u201d by most of my other peers because i was chubby and didn\u2019t do well in school (neurodivergent). They would constantly be passive aggressive to me and act like i was a pest whenever i was trying to genuinely be nice so i started resenting them and hanging out with the people who actually accepted me.\n\nToday i changed a lot. I lost tons of weight after  high school and i made friends with a photographer who helped me get a start up with modeling. Im no where near as successful as a Naomi campbell but i do high fashion editorial modeling. Im proud of my position and im aware that im very fortunate to be in the position i am in.\n\nYesterday night was my middle school reunion, i have a good group of friends ive known since middle school so we all went together. When we arrived i felt uncomfortable and only spoke to my group or the people who didn\u2019t treat me like crap, whenever one of the people who used to act shitty towards me tried to speak to me i just ignored them, continuing to talk and not looking at them at all. I didn\u2019t see an issue, they did the same thing to me, but apparently it irritated one of the dudes (this one posted my low test score to humiliate me in middle school). He came up to me and was trying to talk to me but i just ignored him. He started telling me i thought i was better than everyone else and i was acting like a stuck up prick. I replied that i am better than everyone else and that\u2019s why i have a more successful career. We then had some back and forth because i mentioned that he treated me like crap so he shouldn\u2019t act entitled to my time or respect, at that point my friends told me to let\u2019s just leave. I personally feel like you dish out what you get, they all did the same shit to me in middle school.

First problem, I can tell you that a lot, and I mean A LOT of us over the age of 21 do not recall half of what happened in middle school.  We'd remember a vague ick about somebody but probably not anywhere as specific as you mentioned.  Second, there has never, ever, been a middle school reunion.  High School, College, yes.

Real adults move on from middle school.", "ESH - the best thing to do would be to not force yourself to be around these people. Your behavior was pretty immature.", "Yes YTA. Let me explain why. None of us are the snot we used to be in middle school. I was picked on a lot, I get it. I really do. Many years after I graduated I discovered the kids who were the meanest had really rotten home lives. They acted out at school because it was the only way they could feel good about themselves.

I know it can be traumatic to walk into a place that holds so many bad memories for you. I'm glad that you were able to walk in with your head held high. I was severely bullied in school for many reasons. Race being one of them. I understand the hurt and anger and the need to make people feel they didn't win in breaking you. Had you just gone in and confronted him, it could have been healing for you. Instead, you just made yourself look bad by trying to act superior, and it unfortunately will probably make your bully be seen as a victim while also giving others a new reason to shun you and look down on you. This wasn't a win for you. I hope you're able to heal.", "ESH. you arent better than anyone", "YTA for writing this fake ass post lol", "You went to the middle school reunion?

Find a therapist and work on moving past freaking middle school.", "They were the AH then, YTA now.  What we do and who we are as young adolescents is entirely different than as adults.
