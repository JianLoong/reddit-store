In middle school i was excluded and treated really harshly by my fellow classmates. I lived in a predominantly asian area and am asian myself, but i was never seen as \u201casian enough\u201d by most of my other peers because i was chubby and didn\u2019t do well in school (neurodivergent). They would constantly be passive aggressive to me and act like i was a pest whenever i was trying to genuinely be nice so i started resenting them and hanging out with the people who actually accepted me.\n\nToday i changed a lot. I lost tons of weight after  high school and i made friends with a photographer who helped me get a start up with modeling. Im no where near as successful as a Naomi campbell but i do high fashion editorial modeling. Im proud of my position and im aware that im very fortunate to be in the position i am in.\n\nYesterday night was my middle school reunion, i have a good group of friends ive known since middle school so we all went together. When we arrived i felt uncomfortable and only spoke to my group or the people who didn\u2019t treat me like crap, whenever one of the people who used to act shitty towards me tried to speak to me i just ignored them, continuing to talk and not looking at them at all. I didn\u2019t see an issue, they did the same thing to me, but apparently it irritated one of the dudes (this one posted my low test score to humiliate me in middle school). He came up to me and was trying to talk to me but i just ignored him. He started telling me i thought i was better than everyone else and i was acting like a stuck up prick. I replied that i am better than everyone else and that\u2019s why i have a more successful career. We then had some back and forth because i mentioned that he treated me like crap so he shouldn\u2019t act entitled to my time or respect, at that point my friends told me to let\u2019s just leave. I personally feel like you dish out what you get, they all did the same shit to me in middle school.

First problem, I can tell you that a lot, and I mean A LOT of us over the age of 21 do not recall half of what happened in middle school.  We'd remember a vague ick about somebody but probably not anywhere as specific as you mentioned.  Second, there has never, ever, been a middle school reunion.  High School, College, yes.

Real adults move on from middle school.", "ESH - the best thing to do would be to not force yourself to be around these people. Your behavior was pretty immature.", "Yes YTA. Let me explain why. None of us are the snot we used to be in middle school. I was picked on a lot, I get it. I really do. Many years after I graduated I discovered the kids who were the meanest had really rotten home lives. They acted out at school because it was the only way they could feel good about themselves.

I know it can be traumatic to walk into a place that holds so many bad memories for you. I'm glad that you were able to walk in with your head held high. I was severely bullied in school for many reasons. Race being one of them. I understand the hurt and anger and the need to make people feel they didn't win in breaking you. Had you just gone in and confronted him, it could have been healing for you. Instead, you just made yourself look bad by trying to act superior, and it unfortunately will probably make your bully be seen as a victim while also giving others a new reason to shun you and look down on you. This wasn't a win for you. I hope you're able to heal.", "ESH. you arent better than anyone", "YTA for writing this fake ass post lol", "You went to the middle school reunion?

Find a therapist and work on moving past freaking middle school.", "They were the AH then, YTA now.  What we do and who we are as young adolescents is entirely different than as adults.

You should too.", "I call cap, \"middle school reunion\", what a waste of time, honestly, the best thing you could've done, is show up, do what you did differently, and then leave, or at least invite the people that were cool or friends, I think this is kinda dumb, asking if you're the asshole, when there is backstory to prove you right? And your friend has a slight point where you could've been passive aggressive and not be so direct, but that is just an opinion, you can do whatever you want, because he was not in your shoes, when that shit happened to you.", "YTA", "YTA and for the love of god, get over yourself.... AND middle school like ffs", "The fuck is a middle school reunion?", "YTA\n\nBut it's complicated.  \nYou have been bullied and it sucks. Especially because it was for things you had either little (chubbyness) or no control (neurodivergent) control over.  \nThat 100% leaves a mark on a person. In that regard I can relate a bit as someone who was also bullied severely (and is also neurodivergent).  \nYou are currently doing well in life and you got there because of your own inner strength. For that you deserve praise and respect.\n\nWith that said:  \nMiddle school?  \nReally?  \nThat is what, 11-13 year old?  \nYou were all kids back then and kids simply are fucking brutal to each other.   \nIn no way does that mean the people who were mean in middle school are still the same way in your twenties, people change way too much in the timeframe.  \nWhile you are not obligated to socialise or make small talk with people you do not want to, ignoring people and loudly proclaiming your 'superiority' is a real childish mindset here. So if this is specifically about middle school then you are 100% the asshole. It has been 10+ years in the part of your life where people grow and change radically and often become totally different people. I understand that it hurt you, but there is a big chance these are not the people you once knew. For you to act like this really suggests deeper trauma and I would consider taking steps to work through it in a healthy manner. It was bad that it happened, but right now you are also no dealing with it healthily. Maybe you feel like letting go is letting them get away with what they did when they were kids. But it's not about that. It is about you being able to let go for your own sake. These people probably don't think about what happened in any way.  You seem to do so a lot. So help yourself.\n\nNow, if we add highschool:  \nI assume that is the 14-18 age range.  \nPuberty in full swing, we are all little shits, and bullying continues, finds a new mark or intensifies. Because, once again, everyone is a little shit with an underdeveloped brain that cannot yet 100% correctly process consequences or empathy. Like you, I was also bullied in high school. Relentlessly even. So I somewhat know how it feels. And now again, you are 23.  You are at least 5 years out of highschool. You are probably very different from who you were back then. So are your bullies probably. All not 100% there yet, but all taken another step on the path. You say you wanted your highschool bullies to apologise to you. This rarely happens. And if it happens, it will not happen during your twenties, when people are still learning about healthy communication with other humans. You are 5-10 years too soon for that. At this point, if they have any feelings about it, it might be feelings of 'we bullied her back then, let's leave her alone, she lives her life now, doubt she wants to hear anything of us let alone remind her about that shit time'.    \nThere is ofcourse a chance they haven't changed, since some people don't, but the change that they did change is a lot bigger.\n\nBut you will never find out.  \nThe way you behaved, combined with how combatant you are in the comments below is typical early twenties behaviour: Grown up in some ways, yet still terribly immature in others.  \nYour insecurity and the grudge you held came out and made you act insufferable and needlessly arrogant here. Let what you do now speak for itself.  Right now you have diminished your own accomplishments. You don't have to forgive them nor forget about what happened. But right now you are living in the past by thinking nothing has changed, which makes you want to settle scores of at least 5 years ago, but probably 10+ years (since you name the middle school test example). That is not healthy.\n\nBack then they were massively the assholes for how they treated you, but right now you are the asshole for how you behaved at this event.  \nBe better. That is how you get back at people, if you really have to. And if you need apologies then you should have taken the opportunity to politely yet publicly confront them.
