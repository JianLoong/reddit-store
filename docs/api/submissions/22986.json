How sad that so many parents don't like the company of their own children.", "For whatever it\u2019s worth, I know a few people who own summer properties (mostly to rent out), and it\u2019s pretty common for them to reach out to close family/friends and say \u201cHey would you want to use the property (date range)? Checking in before renting it out!\u201d Some folks like to do things for family but don\u2019t like to just gift money, so offering time at a rental property can be a way to do that (missing an opportunity to earn money off renters doesn\u2019t feel quite the same as spending money that\u2019s already in the bank).", "Gotta say, I tend to assume that the people who invite me will also be there, rather than just giving me their property.", "It's a short-term rental house, so it's not unreasonable to want your family to come test it out to make sure it's not missing anything important, or there aren't some annoying features that would result in bad reviews if they go the vrbo/airbnb route.\n  \nBut either way, it's totally incumbent on OP to figure out all these details *before* agreeing to stay there.", "[removed]", "Sounds like OP just doesn't want to share the cabin with her aunt and uncle..she thought this was just going to be them. Probably using the kids as an excuse to back out. And who doesn't check out the details before accepting? My first question is always who is going. That often makes my decision right on the spot LOL", "That's what I would do. Or put myself and my husband in the living room if people like to stay up later", "And the aunt is well aware that OP has two children. Surely she invited them knowing there would be enough room for everyone. It's not unusual for some people to sleep in the lounge", "Yeah what the hell was that comment", "Lol this line was so funny. Like okaaaay? We make okay money too but whenever we go on vacation, we just use one room, we don\u2019t mind sharing room with our two small kids. That means pillow fights! Were we more tired? Yes. But def something kids will remember. Sounds like OP just wants to go on vacation by themselves (no kids or relatives) because \u201cthey make good money\u201d.", "But they make good money. They can't do that. Not sure why they wouldn't sleep, we have done it many times too with no problem.", "My family alllllways shared hotel rooms on vacation when I was growing up. (Meant adding a rollaway for my little brother, while my sister and I slept in one bed and my parents slept in the other.) Fast forward to my own family vacations, and yep, all five of us shared a hotel room. \n\nIs it optimal? nope. But to me, that is so totally normal that I wouldn't have turned down a weekend because of it.", "I\u2019m really glad my parents liked me and my sister. Seeing how some parents treat their kids makes me so so thankful for them.", "I live in the western world, but Europe, and have no problem with it and have done it many times on holiday and we all slept fine, and also they were in our bedroom as babies as well. Young children sleep better in the parents bedroom. I think it's more common in the US to never sleep in the same room.", "A lot of times it's about the fact that your kid deserves and should have a room to themselves where they can have privacy. \n\nUp to a certain age I can see sharing a bedroom with your parents, but at some point even as a small kid you're going to want time away. You're going to want time to just play by yourself/with friends, play with your toys, Read a book, just get some alone time.\nAnd that is a lot easier to do when you have your own room with a door.", "Because the western world is scolded into believing bedsharing is extremely dangerous vs. being educated on the many benefits and many safe measures that can be put in place to make it safe. So instead people either buy the bullshit and shame others along with the masses or they lie and hide it for fear of being shamed.", "That may mean they get up early depending on what time the other couple wakes up", "Thats totally fair. I guess I just found it odd this parent was SO against the idea, to the point of it ruining the whole trip", "Really? I would think they cheer her on?", "Not all of us, I slept in a separate room from my parents on every vacation I can remember that included family homes. Hotels were different though.", "You took the words right outta my mouth.", "And so sad. I have always enjoyed those times with my kids. They are teens now, but we would still share a room if it's necessary, but I understand that they prefer their own room. I don't mind sharing.", "OP should have asked not just assumed aunt wasn't coming. Aunt could have said they were coming also. But OP should know if Aunt is known for letting people stay at their condo with or without Aunt at the condo. Now she wants to cancel plans with someone because she stuck sharing a room with her kids for a couple of days. OP should be happy she doesn't live in a time were everyone slept in one room right next to each other and the fire place.", "You can do whatever you want.  It\u2019s your life.  And OP can do whatever they want, with their life.", "Every family is different, you know.  I\u2019m glad it works for you.  Just not the case for everyone.", ">How sad that so many parents don't like the company of their own children\n\nThat's not what I'm picking up at all!\n\nSome people just like a break from everyone.", "True, but that's usually pretty clear when offered that way.", "u/FedeWeek95 is a comment-stealing bot who stole this from u/Umm_what_I_think_is. Downvote and report as spam.", "It's also not unusual for kids that young to sleep with their parents on a trip. Or on a mattress on the floor.", "My parents made great money. Didn\u2019t change the fact that as the youngest I was sleeping in a chair on vacation. \n\nI do greatly appreciate being able to afford my own room on family vacations now.", "I think about this all the time especially around school break times. The amount of people that post complaining about having their kids home for X amount of days/weeks is just absurd. My mom loved school breaks because it meant we got to spend more time together. She would always make a comment about how she actually enjoyed her kids.", "Yeah I'm 100% sure it's a US issue. My mom and I slept in the same room until I was 13", "this is for 2 days.. on a trip...", "This is a holiday and the kids are very young, they don't need privacy at that age, they need contact to their parents.", "I meant you cannot send your hosts to bed at 7 because it's your 3 y.o. bed time. \nI think the aunt assumes the kids would sleep with the parents in the same bedroom. \nShe prob did not realise high earners don't do that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44", "Is not that they don\u2019t like kids. Nobody is holier for having kids and nobody is mean for not. They don\u2019t like people who had kids and doesn\u2019t take good care of them because that is the main reason many of them chose not to have any, they didn\u2019t think they could take proper care of one.\n\n-Me, mother of 2, aunt of plenty.", "In the post, it says it's \"a new rental house\" so it's possible that there's no history to go on. But I agree with everything else you said. :-)", "Kids sleep on the floor and parents get the bed. It isn't that hard or a big deal unless you are a big baby.", "But why? What is stopping everyone from sleeping? Does someone snore?", "They have a break from sleeping with their kids every day at home. And unless they bring their nanny or leave the kids with a babysitter at home they don't have a break from their kids anyway while they are awake.", "I mean it's common to have a separate room for the kids at home here, but on vacation it's not uncommon to sleep in the same room and never heard anyone say that they can't sleep that way.", "If they get a break at home without a babysitter because the kids have a room to go to sleep, the same will apply on vacation.", "I think it\u2019s because that would be a generous offer and you shouldn\u2019t assume someone is being that generous unless they tell you that directly. It\u2019s like being invited to someone\u2019s house for dinner and expecting them to serve something expensive like filet mignon instead of an everyday meal like baked chicken.", "But they have a break once the kids are asleep even if it's the same room. Why is physical distance during sleep so important?", "I think it's the boundary off a wall to give people privacy. The rooms could be barely big enough for a bed each, but with a wall in between them they get privacy.", "OK? I don't understand that concept within my own nuclear family and kids that small ( teens yes, but even they are fine with it occasionally on holiday in our household), but I guess it's a US thing."]}
