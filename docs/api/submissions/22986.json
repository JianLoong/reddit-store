Generally an invite to someone\u2019s vacation home means visiting them, not just using their home.", "YTA if you cancel after specifically confirming with your aunt that you\u2019re going. She invited you, checked with you, and is presumably looking forward to spending time with you and your family. Yes, it sounds like there was a misunderstanding about the logistics of the trip - that happens. But it\u2018s not kind to change plans last minute simply because you can\u2019t bear the thought of sharing a room with your own kids for a couple of nights.", "YTA.  Who invites people to their home without staying with them? You can last for two days with sleeping with your kids. Maybe they have a sofa bed in the living room. You're just being precious.", "YTA. You knew it was a 2 bedroom and they invited you, you accepted. Typically when people invite you on a trip the people inviting you go too lol\n\nKids can sleep on a couch, or buy an air mattress.", "INFO: are you sure she isn\u2019t making a bed for the kids in the living room or using a pull out couch?", "Info: why can't the kids just sleep in sleeping bags in the living room?", "im going with YTA - as Id personally take your aunts invite as to go join them, and not use their condo alone.\nSo you should have clarified that before confirming.\nIts a dick move to back out now. Also, why can\u2019t you just bring up like a small air matress and blankets and your sons can sleep in the living room? They can also sleep on the couch, there are options here.", "YTA. You made an assumption you would be staying alone. It would be rude to cancel at this late stage. It sounds like your aunt wants to spend time with your family.", "Can they sleep on a couch? Or a pallet on the floor?", "YTA. Get sleeping bags for the kids and park them in the living room to sleep. Go and have fun visiting your aunt at HER vacation house!", "YTA. It\u2019s one weekend, and you agreed more than once.", "YTA \n\nPeople don\u2019t normally invite you to spend a weekend in their rental WITHOUT THEM!\n\nIt\u2019s normally a hang out thing!\n\nSo many people seriously don\u2019t know how to have a conversation! \n\nAlso, chuck the kids on airmatresses on the floor. \n\nYou\u2019ll get the same amount of sleep with them on the floor as if they were in another room as they will wake you the second they are awake jn a strange house anyway", "YTA. How dare you have to share a room with two of your own kids. If you make so much money buy your own vacation home", "Curious why you thought that they would not being going in the first place? Was something said that implied that?", "YTA. And just by this, a spoiled brat. God forbid you share a space with your children and family.", "YTA it sounds like you made an assumption without any confirmation from the owner of the house.", "Tentative YTA if only because you thought that you would be using your Aunt's new property without your Aunt. That's a pretty weird and entitled assumption. If my Mom invited me to use her new RV I wouldn't assume I'm going road tripping without her. I'm also going to echo what a lot of other people have said but kids can sleep in places that aren't the bedroom pretty easily.", "Yeah, you should have clarified.", "I don't understand... They're your kids how come parents don't like staying in the same room with their kids even for 2 days.. do y'all even like your kids...?", "Can the kids sleep in the living room?", "YTA", "YTA and it's \"my husband and me.\"", "If you have so much damn money just buy the entire mountain for your family.", "YTA bring an air mattress", "YTA\n\nThe kids could have slept in sleeping bags on the living room floor. Or on an air mattress.", "So you didn't guess that your host, your family, was interested in actually spending *time* with you?\n\nYes, YTA. You've made it very clear to your aunt and uncle that you're more than happy to take them up on free offers \u2014 just as long as you don't have to do anything distasteful, like actually seeing them.", "YTA. I'm about to be banned because are you stupid?! Its NOT YOUR CABIN. why would you immediately assume they wouldn't be there? Thats pretty ignorant of you. Wow.", "YTA. Whenever I went on vacation with my mom, as a very little kid, we all slept in the same bedroom (her, my older brother, and I). What would you do if you stayed at a hotel? Stick a literal toddler and a kindergartner in their own room?", "NTA kids are tiring, even if you make a mistake by assuming you ll be alone in the room, you don\u2019t need to go just to please your aunt. Hope you just came back with some human excuse like kids getting suddenly sick or something like that. Everyone has a right to change his opinions and plans, life is not a gulag.", "NAH\nWhy not talk to your aunt about how to manage the kids' sleeping arrangements? Maybe there are options you haven't considered.\n\nThey invited you to host a visit. You misunderstood. I do think if you cancel now, \"Ew! We didn't expect YOU at your new cabin,\" you would be a a-hole.", "Y also TA for saying \"with my husband and I.\" It's \"and me.\" I mean, come ***ON***!!! \"With my husband\" + \"With me\" = \"With my husband and me\".", "NTA - yet. Call them and discuss sleeping arrangements. It's still possible they thought ahead and have something in mind that wouldn't squeeze all four of you into one room.\n\nJust plain canceling would imply you didn't want them (aunt and uncle) there.", "NTA but why cancel just explain the situation and that you are willing to Airbnb and catchup with them at some point", "NTA.", "ESH. Your aunt for not telling this up front and assuming it would not be a problem, you for not inquiring about it and thinking you'd have the whole house to yourself.\n\nBooking an extra room is probably the best way out.", "NTA. Staying at a cabin is different than staying at a cabin with another family. I wouldn't mind bunking two to a bed, but 4 is a bit much.", "Wow\u2014cannot believe all these YTA responses.  Makes me think they are not living a life of 2 working parents and two kids that will not sleep in this set up.  Being a parent of a kid that has been that way when traveling in the past, it\u2019s a nightmare.  You don\u2019t sleep, at all.  Everyone is miserable, and then you rush back to work like a zombie.  Don\u2019t say yes out of guilt, do offer an honest explanation of your misunderstanding and try to come to workable solution if possible.  Sometimes, we\u2019ve spent the day together, then just stayed in hotel nearby.  It sounds like you tried to make it work, even in light of a busy schedule but with this logistical change, realized it was not going to be feasible for your family.  That\u2019s okay, but apologize for last minute cancellation/change in plans.\n\nAlso\u2014it seems clear to me that OP thought they were offering up their rental free of charge before they started renting, as a thoughtful, generous offer.  That doesn\u2019t seem strange to me at all to think they were not coming as well, especially if they didn\u2019t explicitly say, we want to vacation with you, please come to our new rental for the weekend.\n\nNTA.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like Aunt and Uncle are happy and excited to have some time with your family, chalk it up to a miscommunication (which happens, that\u2019s life!) and try to enjoy yourselves. It might actually be nice having them with you, maybe you and your husband can have a bit of time to yourselves to go for a walk or a swim while Aunt and Uncle play with the kids. As to sleep, I have a 3 year old and a 6 year old so similar ages, and on vacation with a new environment and fun things to do we rarely get a good night\u2019s sleep anyway. Try to have fun and if it turns out to be less than optimal, it\u2019s just one weekend and not worth ruining what sounds like a lovely relationship with people who want to spend time with you and your kids", "YTA", "YTA. You just assumed they weren\u2019t going to be at the place they invited you to? Disconnected with reality", "NTA. No way should 4 be crowded in one room. I'm picturing a double and bunk beds", "Seems weird that someone who has kids is so opposed to actually, ya know, being around those kids. When you go on other trips and stay at a hotel, do you get a separate room for your kids?", "It\u2019s worse than then that. She assumed these people just went out their way to setup a nice vacation just for her family? Who just assumes this? \n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible for parents to do this for the kids for certain occasions or something, but it\u2019s us usually obvious and made clear to everyone involved, very early on, when something like this takes place. \n\nI\u2019m actually lost how she just assumed that these people wouldn\u2019t be going on their own vacation that they planned. What alternate reality do they live in?", "Or just. Take an air mattress and put the boys in the living room?", "This isn't their home, this is a condo that is going to be a rental property. I can very easily see OP thinking that they were effectively renting it out for free as a nice gift from family. What I don't get is that when they found out, no, Aunt and Uncle are coming too, it seems like no further discussion was being had. No \"Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood, but I'm worried there won't be space for all 6 of us.\" Has OP even established if Aunt and Uncle were planing to spend the night? Maybe they were looking for a day trip and then they would go home and leave them alone for the rest of the weekend.\n\nAlso they could have a pullout in the living room, they could be planing to stay in a nearby hotel, they could have more than one nearby property,  they could day trip if they are closer, they could stay with other family who might be closer, they could see family further away and just be passing through.\n\nIt could be a lot of things. But it sounds like at the first bad sign OP just noped out.", "I've been looking at condos for our upcoming vacation.  Many of them have a queen and a set of bunk beds in the guest bedroom.  One we stayed at recently had 2 queens in the guest bedroom.  I guess OP wanted to be the only queen.", "Bcs the OP makes good money.", "I don\u2019t understand not having my 3 & 5 yo in the same room on a trip lol\n\nWe regularly visited my SIL and we\u2019d take over one of her kid\u2019s rooms (usually the oldest was nice enough to) and my kids just slept on these $15 kid Amazon cots we brought with us", "Came to say exactly this.  OP, YTA.", "Well, they're 3 and 5 y.o.\nThat would mean kiddie bed time for everyone. \nI think OP/hubby in living room ?", "The aunt told OP it was a two bedroom condo, she never said she wouldn\u2019t be staying there and OP had no reason to think otherwise. OP put herself in this position by making assumptions instead of asking questions.", "Except the home belongs to the other family. OP had no reason to think her aunt was just handing over the keys to the condo so OP and her family could stay there alone.", "Ignore the downvotes, you're not wrong. If anyone ever implied that 4 to a bed was the situation, that would be a ridiculous suggestion for a fun vacation.", "I agree with you. I don't care about the downvotes. OP didn't say anything about being told in advance and I can totally see how this misunderstanding could happen. Many people offer the use of their summer place or their winter cabin to other people to enjoy by themselves. It's not unusual at all! But there's really no interpersonal conflict here to vote on so it'll probably get removed.", "How was she not honest upfront? The condo belongs to OP\u2019s aunt and OP knew it only has two bedrooms. You shouldn\u2019t assume someone wouldn\u2019t be staying at their own property unless they tell you that directly.", "Really? Shame on them? The people that invited op to a getaway? Lol", "Unbelievable.", "Maybe my family is super close and trusting, but that doesn't seem far-fetched at *all* to me.", "Why do you keep arguing with everyone who isn't siding with you? Please stop!", ":-)", "Agree!  100%.  Four to a bed\u2014seriously.", "I disagree. Nowhere in the post does OP state that was the case. Many people invite their friends and family to enjoy their summer vacation home (or time-share) without them there! It's not a given!", "I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s far fetched. I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s not reasonable to assume that someone won\u2019t be staying at the property they own. Many people do allow their relatives to stay at their homes without them being present but there also many people who don\u2019t allow that. That\u2019s why when you receive an invitation you should ask for details before you accept it.", "I\u2019m not arguing. I\u2019m simply pointing out a key fact the person overlooked. You\u2019re just mad that no one here agrees with you. It\u2019s not my fault that your comments have been downvoted repeatedly.", "Uh... isn't that the whole point of an online forum? I'm okay with the downvotes, just not your \"shushing.\"", "Yes! So ridiculous!", "Many people also ask relatives or friends to join them on a visit to their vacation or rental properties. I would argue that\u2019s just as common as what you\u2019re talking about which is why you can\u2019t make assumptions.", "Oh yeah, I definitely would have clarified if I was OP in that scenario. I guess I just don't understand why so many comments here seem absolutely baffled as to why OP thought that was the case.", "I'm ok with downvotes. What I'm not ok with is someone arguing with every single comment that doesn't agree with theirs. Live and let live. Let everyone voice their opinions in this forum but they shouldn't argue with everyone who doesn't share theirs", "Well, until OP clarifies that, there's really no interpersonal conflict here to vote on."]}
