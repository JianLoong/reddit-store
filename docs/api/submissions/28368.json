That's rough. Spend time discussing ways you can handle these situations with the assisted living staff who know her to try to get some help on what's helpful and what's harmful in these types of situations. I wouldn't necessarily trust either your brother or random internet strangers on what's appropriate here.", "INFO: does your sister understand *why* you can't have takeaways every weekend? Or does she have an intellectual disability as well as the autism?\n\nI'm autistic myself and from that perspective I'm wondering if taking her home every weekend might be interupting her routine and making the meltdowns more likely. At the assisted living home she probably has a predicable routine that she is used to, so making changes to that can be causing added stress. She wants the takeaway because it's a comfort food and she's wanting to use food to self-regulate, you're denying it (for good reason), and now there's a meltdown.", "It\u2019s worth noting, the spectrum isn\u2019t a scale from not very bad to bad. It\u2019s called a spectrum because there are varying symptoms that can affect you in varying ways, and with verifying severities. \n\nHigh support needs is typically the term used these days for someone who requires a lot of support/cannot live independently. \n\nMany autistic people do have successful/\u201cnormal\u201d lives, so if your sister will never live independently she does have relatively high support needs.", "If you have an article 16 clinic near you - see if she can be seen by a nutritionist.  They can evaluate her health and needs and come up with a plan.  There may be sensory issues - or it could be as simple as you getting some generic take out containers from a restaurant supply store and serving her \"homecooked\" takeout.\n\nCheck to see what resources are available to you - it isn't just you and your brother - there is help available.\n\nI have two nephews who are autistic - on different ends of the spectrum.  One will only eat a handful of foods, but in a healthy amount.  One will eat until he is sick if you let him - we don't let him.\n\nYou aren't alone.  Good for you for getting her into a home with care.  It just can't end there.", "NTA. Your sister is not going to ALWAYS get her way regardless of being autistic or not. Eating take out all the time isn't good for anyone. Yes, she's an adult but she's not an independent adult, she requires supervision for a reason.

You can also make sure she has the foods she likes readily available when she's with you. \n\nIf your brother wants more say, he can take on more responsibility and get her take out all the time.

I am in a similar situation with an autistic brother. I understand very much wanting her to eat healthier etc, but it sounds like something you can\u2019t achieve on your own this way. Regardless of what specifically she wants/needs from a takeaway, it\u2019s unlikely you can get her out of a very well-formed habit by trying to take the option away. No idea how much support you have, but including any medical professionals (behavioural specialists and dieticians who understand and deal in helping autism individuals) and carers would be ideal (if possible). Would like to stress again that you are NTA for wanting to help her eat better, and I understand why you have taken this approach, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective, and will likely stress you both out for no real result. \n\nThe following may be unsolicited advice so don\u2019t read if you don\u2019t need that right now: Something that helps make my brother\u2019s visits easier is planning, for instance, on monday his carers will tell him he is cooking bolognese with his sibling on saturday, and that\u2019s repeated throughout. \n\nAlso, seeing lots of ill-informed people here who don\u2019t seem to know much about autism - some autistic individuals have very high support needs, can\u2019t care for themselves or sometimes can\u2019t speak - these types of issues around food are very common for people with autism, and the sister is likely not deliberately trying to make things difficult.", "I wonder if she has some kind of sensory hypersensitivity or r/ARFID but have you spoken to the support staff to see what she\u2019s like at the assisted living?", "NTA. It's one thing to accomodate for sensory issues, like, you made rice but she can't stand it, or you made potatoes in a way that creates an awkward texture for her, or you put more or less salt, used the \"wrong\" vegetable - those are legit issues and aversions that you could work with. However, \"I want takeout\" is just a luxury, she isn't entitled to it.\n\nYou are already picking up 3/4 of her expenses and housing her on the weekends. If your brother wants to give in to her whims, he can at least have the decency of doing it on his dime instead of calling you names.", "I think she needs to spend more time with her brother.\n\nDon't get caught in the trap of being the single person, who finds that the family has dumped all the unpleasant responsibilities on you because \"you don't have a family\".  Resist!", "As a person who works with people with developmental disorders including people with autism i'm going to say NAH.

Those kinds of problems are *very* common with autism, and can cause extreme discomfort when eating foods that aren't considered \"safe.\" Her reactions to home-cooked food could be a result of being spoiled, but they could just as easily be a result of *extreme discomfort* with eating. \n\nThis is a matter for a professional to address, who knows your sister's individual needs. It's not something people on the Internet can tell you one way or another.", "It depends on what sort of take out she is insisting on.\n\nCurry and rice - home cook, dish it up in takeaway containers. Same for homemade Mexican or Chinese. I keep the takeaway dishes as they are ideal for freezing fruit, vegetables, etc. I wash them thoroughly, then let them dry. Every so often I do a \u201cmarry up\u201d blitz and throw out any unmatched pots and tops. \n\nBurgers and kebabs are more difficult as the polystyrene clam-shells aren\u2019t easy to clean out. Nor are the chip pockets.\n\nBattered fish and chips, well then you need paper to wrap them in. Perhaps you could revert to using newspaper as they used to be in the old days.\n\nPizza - you need pizza boxes\u2026 Can\u2019t wash those out either, but perhaps a local pizza place might be prepared to sell you some pizza boxes if you ask nicely.\n\nI expect half of the fun for her is the opening of the boxes, unwrapping the fish & chips, etc rather than worrying about the contents.", "NTA. There's no reason for you to have to order takeaway every weekend. If your brother wants her to get takeaway, he can have her stay in his house and order it.", "NTA but if you live in the United States you could go through the state you live in and they can help get her benefits to live in a CILA or DD hone which is similar to the assisted living with staff to assist and you don't pay the state and federal government do.

You\u2019re paying 75% and meals out are expensive. \n\nI don\u2019t know your sisters abilities or if this would help but maybe telling her what to expect before you take her home with you would help?

I am what would be considered 'high functioning' but due to basic accommodations next to impossible to get at work, and the discrimination that limits autistic people's job opportunities, plus the difficulties maintaining healthy long term relationships that can help lift the day to day burden of living - I am guaranteed to live in poverty, snd would almost certainly be dead if I did not have my parents house to move to. If I was able to hold a well enough paying job that is not retail, I likely could have made it on my own indefinitely, even if I was struggling greatly.\n\nI would consider setting a reasonable allowance for take out food for your sister - enough for a few take out dishes, and let her decide herself what she should eat. She has very little autonomy, so I hate thinking about having this thing that she may have been using as a reward for just surviving the week, and now it is gone. It may sound extreme but being able to save up to afford even one takeout dish a month, when extra poor, really could make a huge difference in my disposition, trying to exist in a world that always tells you you are wrong.\n\nNTA because most people share your viewpoint but most people are not coming at it from lived experience. Not everyone who is autistic with ARFID will agree with me, but perhaps you could develop some relationships with other autistic people to try and understand where your sister is coming from.\n\nBeing autistic is not an excuse for bad or selfish behavior, but please try to make sure you are understanding the reason why it matters to her. It won't make sense to you! That is important to remember - it is not about understanding her perspective, but being understanding of hers,  and that if you are trying to relate in order to agree, you are setting thongs up to fail.\n\nAnd one last note - neurodiversity runs in families, so it likely your brother or you will have at least one neurodivergent nibbling. Understanding your sister will help you be able to understand the next generation and help be their advocate, with hindsight and knowledge, to help them through the world, with self assurance and awareness of how to advocate for themselves.

Perhaps ask her what she would like to eat for dinner the next time she visits, so that it can be something she has been wanting to eat, or can never have at the home but you can provide.

They couldn't really have expected their other children to take care of her forever. They are the AH if that's the case. \nEdited to finish comment", "exactly my thoughts.  OP may want to save fir a family of her in one day. doesn't seem fair", "Yep I was wondering if this was due to arfid or a sensory aversion. Sometimes anything but a safe food literally makes me want to hurl. OP it\u2019s not necessarily about entitlement, it might just be an actual physical reaction/aversion to foods that are inconsistent, unknown, sensorily problematic etc.", "If the purpose of home cooked meals is healthier food, hot dogs, fries and ketchup\ndefeats the purpose.", "Or even, see what meals they make already that the sister will eat, because I guarantee they\u2019re not getting the sister special takeaway always.", "A less graphic illustration is biting into a cookie expecting chocolate chips, and getting raisins.\n\nBut for me it\u2019s organs. I tried to make kidneys once, because I have some old recipe books and wanted to try things, and I made kidneys in sauce or gravy of some sort. And it wasn\u2019t a flavour thing, and the sauce was really quite tasty, but just something about the kidneys I could not do. Put the first bite in my mouth and thought \u2018sauce turned out nice, and if I chew or swallow this I WILL throw up,\u2019 and that is the first time in my life something I\u2019ve tried to eat has ever, ever come close to making me puke. Absolute full body rejection.", "I cannot even fathom eating tongue for just the reason you described, and I am nauseated now thinking about it.", "As an ADHD with some sensory issues girlie, this is exactly why I stick to chicken and beans.", "This is an incredible response and I hope OP reads it.", "Are you going to pay for the 3 takeaway meals per day every weekend for OP?", "When I was 5 I refused to eat anything other than McDonald\u2019s bacon and egg McMuffins for breakfast. My mother couldn\u2019t go to Maccas every morning for me, so she made me home made bacon and egg muffins and put them in the styrofoam container that they used to come in. I never knew until she told me years later.", "There is a lot of sense in this comment, but we also don\u2019t know if she was neglected or made to grow up too fast in her home growing up due to her sisters high needs. Of course this isn\u2019t hers or her sister\u2019s fault. We don\u2019t know what her parents were like. Did they give her what she wanted because it was easiest? Did they do the best they could with what they knew? She seems like she is taking a lot on and maybe having a sense of control in her mind is helpful. It doesn\u2019t have to be one extreme or another. Hopefully she takes all if this advice to heart and they all have a healthy relationship.", "Yep - bro thinks you're being unfair but you're paying 75% of her care costs so if he really thinks you sister should have takeaways, he can pay for it.", "It's incredibly common for parents of disabled children (of all kinds) to treat their other children like a care plan for the disabled sibling after they pass away. Bc faaaaaaamily, of course.", "The caregiving set ups I\u2019ve heard work well are usually that direct caregivers contribute LESS than their share financially to make up for their labor (which is likely unpaid). So to have bro contribute fewer dollars, possibly not caretake, AND be critical of food choices just seemed like some clarity here might be needed. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a fan of single or childless people having to take up slack of others because of chosen family status. But each family has their own deal. Worth a check in.", "I didn't brute force feed my kids. One had an extremely limited palate (texture was their issue). We would make a huge quantity of their favourite foods, and freeze portions. If they didn't like what the rest of us were eating for dinner, they'd get a frozen portion and have that. \nAnyhow, last time I was talking to them, they were lamenting all the years that I cooked Thai Red Curry for the family, then they opted out. Apparently, red curry is now their favourite meal.", "Honestly as an autistic person who has different support needs, this is what has helped me learn to cook. My first few dishes were not healthy, but easy. I gradually learned as able to learn to cook other things that were healthier for me. I needed the foundation of so called junk food to gain the confidence I needed in the kitchen. \n\nI still need support in the kitchen. There\u2019s tasks I safely cannot do. But because I started on very simple things, I\u2019m able to build up on those skills. \n\nI\u2019m more than happy to infodump more, but just tossing in my perspective.", "You need to pick your battles, though. Not eating at all is also unhealthy, and someone with a significant food issue - as some people with autism do - absolutely will just not eat what is provided. To them it\u2019s the same as you being expected to chow down on a brick or a nice fresh pile of dog poo.", "Yes, that's one purpose - but you want to get Sis to accept home cooked meals first. Once you've done that you can start working on having her eat healthier dishes.", "Also the raisin vs chocolate chip thing is disgusting. It feels like biting a bug or something. *shudder*", "I'm not sure that's a good illustration. I've done that before. At first I'm confused, then disappointed, then I realize the raisin cookie tastes good, so it's all good.\n\nThe craziest version of this I had was I thought I grabbed a regular Coke but had grabbed a diet Mountain Dew out of habit (I may drink too much pop...). Opening the can was automatic and I hadn't really seen the can. I was extremely confused and in my brain I was \"tasting\" the flavors of both kinds of pop. After I looked at the can and realized what I did, then sips after that tasted normal. Very strange.", "she didn't even warn me! Just said it was beef goulash iirc. I had to ask after THE INCIDENT and then was all yeah, we decided to use beef tongue \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\nBy hubby, who like lingua tacos, said that they should have removed the taste buds, since he has yet to get taste buds at even the cheapest whole in the wall Mexican food place.", "The original poster is using British English so it\u2019s a fair bet that they aren\u2019t in the US.", "If OP is going to have her sister on the weekend OP needs to have a functional understanding of her sister's condition and why she can't just eat whatever OP decides to feed her.\n\nIf OP cannot find out  and have on hand what home-cooked foods her sister can eat then OP cannot have her sister at meal times.", "Poor them.", "I find this kind of lovely that you gave them space to come around to this in their own time, and now they have the whole life rest of their life to enjoy red curry \u2665\ufe0f", "Not autistic, but ADHD, and I've used frozen pizza and hamburger helper type stuff not because they're healthy but as a way to (re)build a habit of not eating out/ordering in.", "As the original poster\u2019s sister lives in an assisted living facility, she doesn\u2019t need to learn to cook.", "Then why not accommodate her wish for take out?", "For me it\u2019s the disconnect between expectation and reality. And I didn\u2019t want a raisin cookie, I wanted a chocolate chip cookie. And the cookie lied to me. And now I\u2019m mad at the cookie. \n\nI do like oatmeal raisin cookies, if I\u2019m expecting oatmeal raisin cookies. But I dislike raisins in cookies, because they keep lying to me and that\u2019s not cool. \n\nFor clarity, I am aware that both cookies and raisins are inanimate objects. This is just the best way I can describe what the experience feels like.", "Yeah, from watching cooking shows I know you\u2019re supposed to scrape them off which is still gross to me. I just don\u2019t eat organs of any kind because it\u2019s all gross.", "No, the staff likely know what she does and doesn't eat so they give her things she can eat. ARFID isn't as simple as \"I don't eat certain foods and lose significant weight\", often a problem is deficiencies that cause issues like fatigue that will be explained with the condition.", "She may feel more comfortable in her group home, because it's her *home*, it's where she is every day. If she's more comfortable, and if they serve the same food on a regular schedule so she can look at the menu and know in advance that they'll have spaghetti on Monday (just like every week) and chicken on Tuesday (just like every week) and so on she might feel confident enough to eat the foods that she's used to in the place she's comfortable, because she knows what to expect.", "Well, I can confirm that -  \n\nthey did not die of malnutrition. \n\nI will never eat spaghetti bolognaise or tacos ever again in MY life after being forced to cook them each weekly for 10-15 years. \n\nKiddo was not \"trying it on to get junk food\" - they wouldn't even touch McDonalds fries, and never has tolerated fizzy drinks/soft drinks/soda.", "I\u2019m actually kinda stupid and completely misread this. I apologize. For some reason my brain parsed it as using this foods to teach Sister to cook. \ud83d\ude2c", "You don't know what her care plan is. If she's capable of cooking and wants to learn, then she should be able to, at first with assistance, and then increasingly on her own. That's what independent living is. And if what she wants to learn to cook is hot dogs, then she should be given support to learn to cook hot dogs.", "It's possible that OP simply cannot afford to do so on an ongoing basis. Which is also a reasonable problem. However, the solution is never going to be to simply say \"That's it, none of this nonsense\". It doesn't *work*.", "Where does the original poster say that their sister wants to cook hot dogs?", "The original poster states that their parents were too indulgent and \u201cI decided to be strict.\u201d.\n\nWith as much detail as the original poster has provided, I believe that if funds were the issue they would have said so.\n\nIt sounds like the original poster is upset that their sister was spoiled by their parents and is attempting to impose discipline.", "It was an example.", "Yes, which is not necessarily OP\u2019s place, to be frank. \n\nAn autistic adult is still an adult. Lots of us have texture issues with particular foods and eat a narrow range of things as a result. This is not an opportunity to impose strictness because eating is better than not eating. I noticed OP didn\u2019t say \u201cI made my sister her favorite meals\u201d or \u201cI worked with her caregivers to figure out what to cook for her.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP really has a good understanding of autism if she thinks the answer is just imposing discipline.", "The original poster\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t want to cook anything. She wants take out.", "Yep. That\u2019s why I said ESH - OP doesn\u2019t seem to have done her homework to understand what will work, which she should have done. Obviously her care team during the week is feeding her successfully, so how? At the same time, takeaway every weekend *isn\u2019t* cheap, so it\u2019s not unreasonable for the brother to pitch in more if that\u2019s what is going to have to happen.", "I agree.

No matter anyone\u2019s reasons for their diet, it\u2019s their choice.\n\nFor the record, I am an avid home cook and baker. I eat a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. I just don\u2019t believe that I should impose my eating habits on others or vice versa.", "You don\u2019t know whether she wants to cook, and neither do I. What we know is that she has a care plan and goals at her group home, and OP doesn\u2019t know what they are."]}
