That's rough. Spend time discussing ways you can handle these situations with the assisted living staff who know her to try to get some help on what's helpful and what's harmful in these types of situations. I wouldn't necessarily trust either your brother or random internet strangers on what's appropriate here.", "INFO: does your sister understand *why* you can't have takeaways every weekend? Or does she have an intellectual disability as well as the autism?\n\nI'm autistic myself and from that perspective I'm wondering if taking her home every weekend might be interupting her routine and making the meltdowns more likely. At the assisted living home she probably has a predicable routine that she is used to, so making changes to that can be causing added stress. She wants the takeaway because it's a comfort food and she's wanting to use food to self-regulate, you're denying it (for good reason), and now there's a meltdown.", "It\u2019s worth noting, the spectrum isn\u2019t a scale from not very bad to bad. It\u2019s called a spectrum because there are varying symptoms that can affect you in varying ways, and with verifying severities. \n\nHigh support needs is typically the term used these days for someone who requires a lot of support/cannot live independently. \n\nMany autistic people do have successful/\u201cnormal\u201d lives, so if your sister will never live independently she does have relatively high support needs.", "If you have an article 16 clinic near you - see if she can be seen by a nutritionist.  They can evaluate her health and needs and come up with a plan.  There may be sensory issues - or it could be as simple as you getting some generic take out containers from a restaurant supply store and serving her \"homecooked\" takeout.\n\nCheck to see what resources are available to you - it isn't just you and your brother - there is help available.\n\nI have two nephews who are autistic - on different ends of the spectrum.  One will only eat a handful of foods, but in a healthy amount.  One will eat until he is sick if you let him - we don't let him.\n\nYou aren't alone.  Good for you for getting her into a home with care.  It just can't end there.", "NTA. Your sister is not going to ALWAYS get her way regardless of being autistic or not. Eating take out all the time isn't good for anyone. Yes, she's an adult but she's not an independent adult, she requires supervision for a reason.

You can also make sure she has the foods she likes readily available when she's with you. \n\nIf your brother wants more say, he can take on more responsibility and get her take out all the time.

I am in a similar situation with an autistic brother. I understand very much wanting her to eat healthier etc, but it sounds like something you can\u2019t achieve on your own this way. Regardless of what specifically she wants/needs from a takeaway, it\u2019s unlikely you can get her out of a very well-formed habit by trying to take the option away. No idea how much support you have, but including any medical professionals (behavioural specialists and dieticians who understand and deal in helping autism individuals) and carers would be ideal (if possible). Would like to stress again that you are NTA for wanting to help her eat better, and I understand why you have taken this approach, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective, and will likely stress you both out for no real result. \n\nThe following may be unsolicited advice so don\u2019t read if you don\u2019t need that right now: Something that helps make my brother\u2019s visits easier is planning, for instance, on monday his carers will tell him he is cooking bolognese with his sibling on saturday, and that\u2019s repeated throughout. \n\nAlso, seeing lots of ill-informed people here who don\u2019t seem to know much about autism - some autistic individuals have very high support needs, can\u2019t care for themselves or sometimes can\u2019t speak - these types of issues around food are very common for people with autism, and the sister is likely not deliberately trying to make things difficult.", "I wonder if she has some kind of sensory hypersensitivity or r/ARFID but have you spoken to the support staff to see what she\u2019s like at the assisted living?", "NTA. It's one thing to accomodate for sensory issues, like, you made rice but she can't stand it, or you made potatoes in a way that creates an awkward texture for her, or you put more or less salt, used the \"wrong\" vegetable - those are legit issues and aversions that you could work with. However, \"I want takeout\" is just a luxury, she isn't entitled to it.\n\nYou are already picking up 3/4 of her expenses and housing her on the weekends. If your brother wants to give in to her whims, he can at least have the decency of doing it on his dime instead of calling you names.", "I think she needs to spend more time with her brother.\n\nDon't get caught in the trap of being the single person, who finds that the family has dumped all the unpleasant responsibilities on you because \"you don't have a family\".  Resist!", "As a person who works with people with developmental disorders including people with autism i'm going to say NAH. She most definetly has sensory issues or obsessive compulses related to food due to her disorder, she cant help it.

Those kinds of problems are *very* common with autism, and can cause extreme discomfort when eating foods that aren't considered \"safe.\" Her reactions to home-cooked food could be a result of being spoiled, but they could just as easily be a result of *extreme discomfort* with eating. \n\nThis is a matter for a professional to address, who knows your sister's individual needs. It's not something people on the Internet can tell you one way or another.", "It depends on what sort of take out she is insisting on.\n\nCurry and rice - home cook, dish it up in takeaway containers. Same for homemade Mexican or Chinese. I keep the takeaway dishes as they are ideal for freezing fruit, vegetables, etc. I wash them thoroughly, then let them dry. Every so often I do a \u201cmarry up\u201d blitz and throw out any unmatched pots and tops. \n\nBurgers and kebabs are more difficult as the polystyrene clam-shells aren\u2019t easy to clean out. Nor are the chip pockets.\n\nBattered fish and chips, well then you need paper to wrap them in. Perhaps you could revert to using newspaper as they used to be in the old days.\n\nPizza - you need pizza boxes\u2026 Can\u2019t wash those out either, but perhaps a local pizza place might be prepared to sell you some pizza boxes if you ask nicely.\n\nI expect half of the fun for her is the opening of the boxes, unwrapping the fish & chips, etc rather than worrying about the contents.", "NTA. There's no reason for you to have to order takeaway every weekend. If your brother wants her to get takeaway, he can have her stay in his house and order it.", "NTA but if you live in the United States you could go through the state you live in and they can help get her benefits to live in a CILA or DD hone which is similar to the assisted living with staff to assist and you don't pay the state and federal government do.

You\u2019re paying 75% and meals out are expensive. \n\nI don\u2019t know your sisters abilities or if this would help but maybe telling her what to expect before you take her home with you would help?

I am what would be considered 'high functioning' but due to basic accommodations next to impossible to get at work, and the discrimination that limits autistic people's job opportunities, plus the difficulties maintaining healthy long term relationships that can help lift the day to day burden of living - I am guaranteed to live in poverty, snd would almost certainly be dead if I did not have my parents house to move to. If I was able to hold a well enough paying job that is not retail, I likely could have made it on my own indefinitely, even if I was struggling greatly.\n\nI would consider setting a reasonable allowance for take out food for your sister - enough for a few take out dishes, and let her decide herself what she should eat. She has very little autonomy, so I hate thinking about having this thing that she may have been using as a reward for just surviving the week, and now it is gone. It may sound extreme but being able to save up to afford even one takeout dish a month, when extra poor, really could make a huge difference in my disposition, trying to exist in a world that always tells you you are wrong.\n\nNTA because most people share your viewpoint but most people are not coming at it from lived experience. Not everyone who is autistic with ARFID will agree with me, but perhaps you could develop some relationships with other autistic people to try and understand where your sister is coming from.\n\nBeing autistic is not an excuse for bad or selfish behavior, but please try to make sure you are understanding the reason why it matters to her. It won't make sense to you! That is important to remember - it is not about understanding her perspective, but being understanding of hers,  and that if you are trying to relate in order to agree, you are setting thongs up to fail.\n\nAnd one last note - neurodiversity runs in families, so it likely your brother or you will have at least one neurodivergent nibbling. Understanding your sister will help you be able to understand the next generation and help be their advocate, with hindsight and knowledge, to help them through the world, with self assurance and awareness of how to advocate for themselves. Even just with ARFID! Because so much if it is likely trauma related, created by the experience around eating the food item, and ARFID can truly consume your whole life, so try to recognize the difference between personal opinion and reality.", "The staff would have spoken up or there would be significant weight loss by now. Sometimes indulged individuals just want what they want.", "\"sensory hypersensitivity\" is kinda a given for an autistic adult who needs full time care.", "Finally a sensible comment! The way she talks about her sister seems so unnecessarily cruel. Autism is a very complex thing, and it seems like OP isn\u2019t even trying to put some effort into educating herself about it.", "You know nothing about ASD. Keeping it uninformed!", "You know you can't write a paragraph essentially saying \"autism is just being spoiled and you can just get over it if you choose to\" and then throw in a token \"I understand that with her issues it's harder\" l, right?", "autism isnt something that can be cured.", ">let her eat her food\n\nIt's not her food. OP isn't taking away food she already has, she is simply refusing to order takeaway any time her sister is around. Which is more expensive, and OP is already paying 75% of her expenses.\n\nIt would be one thing if it were a sensory issue, like, the sister can't stand rice but will have potatoes, or would like more salt, or butter instead of oil. But that doesn't call for ordering food.", "If OP added takeaway all weekend that increases it, too. Bro going to shell out for that?", "I got brute force food as a kid and now my ability to expand and maintain my palate is very limited. It's hard to engage with something that is inherently stressful when there's a whole bunch of extra emotional stress added from other people's good intentioms", "That depends on which country you\u2019re in. In the US you want a registered dietitian, but in some other places a nutritionist is the qualified professional.", "Nah, a person can still have ARFID and have a good chunk of weight\u2026 maybe some severe nutritional deficiencies depending on the safe foods, but weight is a separate thing. \n\nProcessed food is often safe food because there is little variation in it. One cracker will almost always taste like the next cracker in the box, unlike the strawberries which may be sweeter, sourer, softer or more crunchy.", "I know?", "isn't that his point?", "No, the idea was that if she was refusing to eat the staff would have brought it up with her sister who is paying the bills."]}
