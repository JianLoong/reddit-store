Calling someone a miserable old bitch because they were calling another person a whore...when you were a guest in another person's home...and the hosts were clearly disapproving your outburst.\n\nYour move should have been to get up and leave. Pretty sure they would all know why.", "NTA in my opinion.  Just because someone is old doesn't mean they get a pass to be rude and disrespectful to others. She had no business to make those rude remarks and slut shame her granddaughter. What an awful women/grandmother. Awful family too if they are okay with her talking to people like that. People in the family shouldn't use the excuse \"oh that's just the way she is\" for that cruel women (if they have ever used that before). That is just enabling her. Glad to see someone finally put her in her place. If the family wants to continue to be her punching bag let them, keep sticking up for yourself and the ones you love. \nMaybe she is the one who will need to repent for all her sins and judgment when she goes up to face god.", "Nta\n\nNever apologize for putting a bigot in their place. Grandma should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA, you have incredible patients to have waited this long to say something. However, it wasn\u2019t your place to say it in this particular occasion. Why doesn\u2019t your gf stand up for you to her bigoted grandmother? Really, partners should handle their families. This to me is the biggest concern that she, along with the rest of the family, permit this behaviour. As the saying goes, \u201cthe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\u201d. Whilst they may not overly be bigoted themselves, by not shutting down the grandmother\u2019s remarks, they are by default supporting her. Why is this?", "NTA.\n\nYou were a **HERO** to your GF's sister.  GF understands; the rest doesn't matter.\n\nEdit:  Just figured out a new designation.  You're an AH --Ass Hero!", "NTA, but I think you didn't need to call her that. \nYou are completely right for calling out her behaviour after all. Respect always goes both ways.", "NTA.  You called out grandma for her sexist and mean comments.  Okay, if I understand it correctly, at a family gathering and sister makes an announcement regarding reaching another milestone in her life (a good thing) and grandma dumps all over it. No one in the family tried to defend sister from grandma.\n\nI cannot believe no one stood up for grandma, except for you.  Is grandma miserable about other things with her family?\n\nPersonally, I think you did the right things.  Why her family lets her act like a tyrant and lets *her* ruin family get togethers is beyond me.  Yet, there are many, many people who want to brush things aside, or under the rug, and avoid head-on confrontation.   I wouldn't expect her family to come around to your side anytime soon. \n\nI surely hope sister continues with her plans; where she lives is none of grandma's business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No, she stood up for her and I think that's awesome. \nFurthermore \"Head of the family\". Because of what? Because grandma is old?
