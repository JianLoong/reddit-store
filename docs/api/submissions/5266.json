I've seen it in quite a few places and it's in the top 100 boys name chart. But it's not a super common name for a boy like Charles or Jacob. \n\nI have a super super common female name and I've always hated it. Like going to school with six other girls in the same grade with the same first name, let alone the whole school. So growing up, I always knew I wasn't going to pick some common name and be done with it, but I also didn't want to pick a name that was too uncommon or unique. \n\nWhen I first told my family the name I got some backlash. Not anything harsh, but comments like \"That's a weird name\", \"I'm not going to call him that\", or \"Can't you use a name like 'Alex' or 'Isaac'?\" But I shut those comments down.\n\nThey chose to shorten his name as a nickname to call him since shortening it does create a more common name, and we all moved past it. At least, I thought we did. Recently I saw my grandmother, who was one of the people against my name choice.\n\nWhen I saw her, she brought up the name. She really tried to stress to me that I should change his name to something more \"normal\". I asked her how she could think about that again so late down the line. This has been his name for months. She told me that it wasn't too late to change his name as he hasn't been born yet and the name wasn't on a birth certificate. I told her no. \n\nShe called me selfish for not changing his name to something easier. She told me how he probably wouldn't be able to spell his own name for a while. I pointed out that unless it was a really really simple name, a lot of kids struggle with spelling their own name for a bit. There's nothing wrong with that. \n\nThen she said other kids would make fun of him for his name and I told her that just because she had never heard of the name, doesn't mean it isn't a well known name in this day and age. Sure, it still isn't commonly used as far as I can tell, but it's still a known name. I told her no, that his name is final and I'm not changing it no matter what anybody says. She called me a b**** and that I'm just causing unnecessary problems. I said she was causing more problems then I was and I left. \n\nMy mom sorta took my side, but told me that she still doesn't fully agree with my name choice either. But she said she understands it's my choice. \n\nAfter thinking about it, I do kinda see how I might be the asshole for giving my kid a slightly uncommon name.
