I consider myself a very good driver, and ever since I\u2019ve had my own car (recently) whenever I drive with other people I always refuse to drive until they\u2019ve all buckled their seatbelts. Overkill, maybe, but I had a friend who got into a really bad accident and I don\u2019t want to take any chances.\n\nSo today, my friend group made plans to go to an event across town, and we decided that I and one other friend would drive everyone. We split up so that three people went in each car. We were only about a mile down the road when my friend, who was sitting next to me, suddenly lunged forwards, pointed out the front window, and yelled, \u201cPedestrian!\u201d\n\nOf course, I reacted on instinct and immediately slammed the brakes. We skidded to a stop and I frantically looked around for a pedestrian. I swear my heart was in my throat. I\u2019ve almost never felt such immediate and severe panic.\n\nBut then my friend started laughing so hard he could barely speak, and when I asked where the pedestrian was, he just kept laughing. I got really mad and started driving again because we were blocking traffic, but I yelled at my friend that it wasn\u2019t funny, and why the hell would he think that was a smart thing to do? He just said that I should have seen the look on my face, so I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and told him to get out. He didn\u2019t want to at first, but I insisted and wouldn\u2019t keep driving, so he said \u201cJesus, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d in a sarcastic tone and got out. Then I drove away, still massively pissed.\n\nWe got to the event just fine after that, and the other friend who\u2019d been in the car with me told the other three what had happened. They were sympathetic, but also implied that I might have overreacted by kicking him out of the car, especially since he never showed up to the event. The only friend who has outright told me I was right to kick my friend out of the car was the one who was in the car with us.\n\nI do really feel guilty and like an AH for kicking my friend out of the car, but I don\u2019t really think I was overreacting. The car directly behind us had to brake quickly to avoid hitting us, and I think we could have gotten in a really serious accident over this. What if I\u2019d swerved and hit oncoming traffic or a light pole? What if we\u2019d been rear-ended? Also, it wasn\u2019t like I was abandoning him on the side of the road. He had his phone, and it was easily only about a ten minute walk to where I\u2019d picked everyone up, and the other car had stopped for gas and was a few minutes behind us on the road. He could have called them and hitched a ride if he\u2019d really wanted to.Do I need to apologize? I want him to realize that what he did was super dangerous and not cool at all.

I've actually been in this exact same situation with my friend, and you did better than me. At the time, I was the only person with a car in our friend group because we were young about 16-17, and one of my friends did this when it was six of us crammed into a car. Instead of pedestrian, they yelled, \"DEER\", and I hit the brakes in the middle of the freeway, almost getting into an accident. Once we got to the place which was about 40 minutes of a drive away from where we lived, I acted like nothing was wrong with the rest of my friend group and gave the silent treatment to the genius who yelled deer. When it was time to go, and they were getting in my car I hit them with the \"What are you doing\", and told them that they needed to find some other way to get home. Nobody stayed with that friend, and it was about sundown. We never spoke after that again besides arguing about that situation. Whomp whomp, you wouldn't have cared if I got into an accident, destroyed my car, and got sued. Find your own way home. Call your mother honestly. People are assholes and need to take accountability for being assholes, you however, are not one of them.", "I did the same thing to a jokester friend who pulled my e-brake while I was taking a corner.  It swung the rear end of the car out and we skidded to a halt.  WHat if there had been another car there?  Or a person?  I kicked him out and made him walk.  I didnt give a F.  \n\nHe lost his right to a ride after that stupid stunt.  You dont mess around with safety.  What if you had caused an accident or fatality?  \n\n>but also implied that I might have overreacted by kicking him out of the car, especially since he never showed up to the event. \n\nCool,  so they can drive him and he can \"joke\" wth them while in the car.

I\u2019d probably go one further and say he is on probation for any future rides with you for x amount of time and that if it happens again he is banned for life for rides with you. Driving is deadly serious. Consequences are often life and death and that is just not something to take lightly.", "NTA. Endangering the life of courself and other people of a stupid joke is never okay, you did the right thing to make him think about his actions. I hope that particular guy doesn't get his license for a long while.", "NTA, your friend risked everyone\u2019s life for a joke, they\u2019re stupid and reckless, and should consider themselves very lucky that all you did was kick them out of the car and still had the ability to walk.", "NTA and said friend is NEVER getting a lift from you ever again, right?", "Nta.", "NTA. He owes you an apology.  The ways that could have gone badly wrong are immense.  Guy needs to start figuring out how to adult.", "Holy wow NTA and do no under any circumstances apologize to that asshole. Like you said, stopping like that could have caused a serious accident to happen and the fact that he doesn't see it is so fucking concerning. I would never let him in my car again after that. He can get s ride with someone else.", "NTA\n\nThe friend was reckless and stupid. He could have caused a serious accident and you would have likely been declared at fault. This would have a serious impact on you (and any other drivers/car owner involved) for years.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let them be a passenger in my car again until they mature and see the seriousness of their mistake.", "NTA and I'm not sure why you or the others would refer to this person as a friend.", "NTA\n\nNo matter your culture, that was not a funny joke. Your ex-friend is an idiot and could have caused a major wreck. I would never speak to him again. If your friends give you flavor, let them know it is not up for discussion.", "Nta. That is soooooo dangerous. You could have easily swerved and crashed the car and the people in the car/s behind you could have been hurt too.", "NTA \n\nI guarantee the people in the car behind you didn\u2019t think it was funny. You ask that driver and he would applaud you for putting him out of the car. He endangered peoples lives, don\u2019t ever let him in your car again.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" played a stupid game and won a walk home on foot. I would refuse to drive him anywhere. You have nothing to apologize for.", "Nta the severity of what he did shouldn\u2019t be hard for your other friends to understand. You all could\u2019ve crashed, the cars behind you could\u2019ve crashed into you or each other. You can be stopped by the police for that and charged with reckless driving in some cases.\nI\u2019d ban him from your vehicle completely and refuse to drive any of the ones who are saying you\u2019ve overreacted aswell.

Why did he even do it? It\u2019s beyond childish, it\u2019s just dangerous.", "NTA at all. How old is this 'friend'?

Jesus.", "NTA\n\nYou can tell anyone questioning your decision, including that a-hole friend:\n\n\"You should have seen his face, when I threw him out!\"", "NTA, that guy is a safety risk. I'd never let that moron ride in my car again.", "10,000% NTA!  He put all of you in danger and thought it was funny.  He's a total IDIOT and FOOL.  Might want to keep your distance from him and DEFINITELY not have him in your car again.", "No way, do NOT apologize. He should apologize to you, sincerely this time. He could have seriously injured you, himself, your other friend, and other drivers. And he just sat there laughing? He's either totally immature or totally selfish. Or both. NTA", "NTA and I would never share a car with him again even if I'm not driving and we are both passengers. What if he does this with another driver while you are in the same car and you don't get to be so lucky as you were last time? Yeah no thanks.", "NTA you all could have had a major accident. Don\u2019t let him ride with you anymore ever. He\u2019s a menace to society.

Never fuck around with the driver.  And the passenger in the back seat would have taken the brunt of it if you'd gotten rear-ended because of the \"prank,\" so I can understand them being on your side.  Ask your friend if he'd be willing to pay car repair and medical bills if he'd caused an accident.", "NTA. If your friend gets taken by Darwin, I'll chip in for a very, very well deserved award.", "NTA - Absolutely do not apologize.
