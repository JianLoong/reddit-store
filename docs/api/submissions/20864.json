{"id": 20864, "submission_id": "14lrubg", "title": "AITA for kicking my friend out of the car after we almost crashed?", "selftext": "Some context: we live on a college campus in a suburban area of a notoriously rural state, and I grew up driving in a large city several states away. I consider myself a very good driver, and ever since I\u2019ve had my own car (recently) whenever I drive with other people I always refuse to drive until they\u2019ve all buckled their seatbelts. Overkill, maybe, but I had a friend who got into a really bad accident and I don\u2019t want to take any chances.\n\nSo today, my friend group made plans to go to an event across town, and we decided that I and one other friend would drive everyone. We split up so that three people went in each car. We were only about a mile down the road when my friend, who was sitting next to me, suddenly lunged forwards, pointed out the front window, and yelled, \u201cPedestrian!\u201d\n\nOf course, I reacted on instinct and immediately slammed the brakes. We skidded to a stop and I frantically looked around for a pedestrian. I swear my heart was in my throat. I\u2019ve almost never felt such immediate and severe panic.\n\nBut then my friend started laughing so hard he could barely speak, and when I asked where the pedestrian was, he just kept laughing. I got really mad and started driving again because we were blocking traffic, but I yelled at my friend that it wasn\u2019t funny, and why the hell would he think that was a smart thing to do? He just said that I should have seen the look on my face, so I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and told him to get out. He didn\u2019t want to at first, but I insisted and wouldn\u2019t keep driving, so he said \u201cJesus, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d in a sarcastic tone and got out. Then I drove away, still massively pissed.\n\nWe got to the event just fine after that, and the other friend who\u2019d been in the car with me told the other three what had happened. They were sympathetic, but also implied that I might have overreacted by kicking him out of the car, especially since he never showed up to the event. The only friend who has outright told me I was right to kick my friend out of the car was the one who was in the car with us.\n\nI do really feel guilty and like an AH for kicking my friend out of the car, but I don\u2019t really think I was overreacting. The car directly behind us had to brake quickly to avoid hitting us, and I think we could have gotten in a really serious accident over this. What if I\u2019d swerved and hit oncoming traffic or a light pole? What if we\u2019d been rear-ended? Also, it wasn\u2019t like I was abandoning him on the side of the road. He had his phone, and it was easily only about a ten minute walk to where I\u2019d picked everyone up, and the other car had stopped for gas and was a few minutes behind us on the road. He could have called them and hitched a ride if he\u2019d really wanted to.Do I need to apologize? I want him to realize that what he did was super dangerous and not cool at all. I swear I\u2019m still feeling aftershocks of panic.

Your friend needs to learn that actions have consequences.  And he should thank his lucky stars that the consequence was that he had to walk, instead of a consequence like having the car fishtail into a tree with a branch at skull height.", "NTA. This is the driving equivalent of yelling 'FIRE!' in a movie theater and thinking it's funny.", "NTA\n\nI would not feel safe driving with someone like that in the passenger\u2019s seat. If he\u2019s going to act that way, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind not going to an event with him.", "NTA. \n\nYour \"friend\" put everyone in that car's life at risk just to play what he calls a \"prank\" on you. \n\nThat is not a prank. That is not funny. People who don't respect the dangers of driving are assholes. Multiple peoples lives could have been irreparably changed had you reacted differently and thankfully it didn't. \n\nDon't feel bad. Your \"friend\" obviously doesn't give a fuck about anyone's life.", "NTA... the car is not a place to play. Cars can be unpredictable and you cant have a risk like that in your car.", "Your friend was risking your lives for a joke. At the very least someone could have rear ended you.\n\nDon't shout warnings to drivers that aren't real, kids. \n\nIf it was only a 10 minute walk then youre good. Its not like you left him 20 miles from the nearest town. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have been laughing if he caused an accident.", "NTA.  What if another car was close behind you?  You could\u2019ve been rear ended.  Never screw with the driver.", "NTA\n\nThe person you kicked out of the car is about as mature as a 10-year-old. You did the right thing in response to his \"prank\".", "NTA. That stunt could have caused a serious accident. Never mind the near heart attack you had. I would have cussed him out as I was using my foot to kick his dumb ass out of the car.", "NTA. He is. He is super lucky there wasn\u2019t an accident. I would also never let him in my car again.

Your friend owes you and the other passenger an apology for risking everyone's safety. You don't owe that idiot shit.", "NTA.\n\nYour \"friend\" is a menace. I hope you never let him ride in your car again.", "Definitely NTA! He owes you and the other passenger an apology.", "NTA by a long shot. Your so called friend could have easily caused an accident. He was just being an ass, not pranking you. Pranks are only funny if the target is laughing at the end.What if a car behind you hadn\u2019t braked in time?

I would never drive that \"friend\" anywhere ever again. \n\nWell, maybe if he was tied up and gagged.", "NTA, whilst any car behind should leave enough space for emergency braking the idiot put you at much higher risk of an accident. anyone playing games like that with your safety is the AH", "NTA.  Actions have consequences.  He is TA, and he reaped the consequences of that decision.  He's mad because you didn't let him get away with it.  What he did is a form of bullying passed off as a joke, and you defended yourself.  Instead of him feeling superior at your expense, he now feels the way he wanted you to feel.  And this wasn't a small thing -- it would have been your driving record, and your insurance, and all of you could have been hurt if the car behind you hadn't reacted quickly enough. I would not apologize, I wouldn't mention it. Just go on with your life.  But I would not let him be a passenger again either.", "NTA and hopefully he will never do that again to another driver (not you, because I'd never let him in my car again).", "NTA, he wasn't going to help for any damages to your car if you were rear ended.

You could have really hurt someone by his stupid actions and tacky behavior. There are so many what if\u2019s at play here as far as causing an accident. You didn\u2019t overreact in the slightest, your friend is a jackass for that. He paid the price when his ass had to walk, I hope it was a great distance, too. So he can reflect on his shitty decisions. Every cause has an effect, and he needs to thank some divine intervention that something major DID NOT happen. May I also suggest you probably should distance yourself from this said friend, he\u2019s not doing you any favors.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I got my license recently (in March) and the first time I drove with my ex in the car, he spent the whole time either critiquing my driving or reading out every single road sign and just driving me absolutely crazy because he was being so distracting despite me asking him to stop several times. We drive into a carpark of a busy shopping centre, he\u2019s going \u2018stop sign. Zebra crossing. Carpark. Shopping centre\u2019 and so on, just completely random unnecessary stuff so I drove through a zebra crossing just as someone was about to cross it. I was so mad with him but he was saying it was my fault for not paying enough attention. Haven\u2019t driven him around since and definitely won\u2019t again.
