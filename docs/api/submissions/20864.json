I consider myself a very good driver, and ever since I\u2019ve had my own car (recently) whenever I drive with other people I always refuse to drive until they\u2019ve all buckled their seatbelts. Overkill, maybe, but I had a friend who got into a really bad accident and I don\u2019t want to take any chances.\n\nSo today, my friend group made plans to go to an event across town, and we decided that I and one other friend would drive everyone. We split up so that three people went in each car. We were only about a mile down the road when my friend, who was sitting next to me, suddenly lunged forwards, pointed out the front window, and yelled, \u201cPedestrian!\u201d\n\nOf course, I reacted on instinct and immediately slammed the brakes. We skidded to a stop and I frantically looked around for a pedestrian. I swear my heart was in my throat. I\u2019ve almost never felt such immediate and severe panic.\n\nBut then my friend started laughing so hard he could barely speak, and when I asked where the pedestrian was, he just kept laughing. I got really mad and started driving again because we were blocking traffic, but I yelled at my friend that it wasn\u2019t funny, and why the hell would he think that was a smart thing to do? He just said that I should have seen the look on my face, so I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and told him to get out. He didn\u2019t want to at first, but I insisted and wouldn\u2019t keep driving, so he said \u201cJesus, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d in a sarcastic tone and got out. Then I drove away, still massively pissed.\n\nWe got to the event just fine after that, and the other friend who\u2019d been in the car with me told the other three what had happened. They were sympathetic, but also implied that I might have overreacted by kicking him out of the car, especially since he never showed up to the event. The only friend who has outright told me I was right to kick my friend out of the car was the one who was in the car with us.\n\nI do really feel guilty and like an AH for kicking my friend out of the car, but I don\u2019t really think I was overreacting. The car directly behind us had to brake quickly to avoid hitting us, and I think we could have gotten in a really serious accident over this. What if I\u2019d swerved and hit oncoming traffic or a light pole? What if we\u2019d been rear-ended? Also, it wasn\u2019t like I was abandoning him on the side of the road. He had his phone, and it was easily only about a ten minute walk to where I\u2019d picked everyone up, and the other car had stopped for gas and was a few minutes behind us on the road. He could have called them and hitched a ride if he\u2019d really wanted to.Do I need to apologize? I want him to realize that what he did was super dangerous and not cool at all.

You did the only thing you could. \n\nThe fact that the other person in the car with you agrees with you says it all. I'm glad you were both safe afterwards, but that guy sounds like a menace.", "NTA. Stand your ground. The next time someone criticize you yell loudly \"spider!\" and point at them. After they will be done making the wriggly dance ask them how would they handle the same situation while needing to simultaneously drive. Not to mention you are responsible for everyone's safety, including the other users of the road. Your \"friend\" is an immature idiot.", "NTA. That would a kick out of the the car and a ban from getting in my car ever", "NTA\n\nSo, your idiot \"friend\" almost caused a pileup over a stupid \"prank\" and somehow your other friends think that's OK?\n\nI'm wondering if OP is a woman, as it sounds like part of the prank depends on the whole \"woman drivers eh, amirite\" trope.\n\nHonestly, I'd probably never drive this f\\*cker anywhere after that stunt.", "NTA, why didn't he text the other car to get a ride to the event? \n\nYour former friend FAFO.", "Ok) [pipl\nIl", "I know someone who swerved to miss a dog that ran into the road, and hit a tree. One of the passengers was killed.\n\nYour \"friend\" is an AH. You are NTA.", "NTA - He is an immature and dangerous AH. And your friends in the other car would have understood if they had been in your car.", "NTA. What the hell is wrong with this guy. I've actually been in this exact same situation with my friend, and you did better than me. At the time, I was the only person with a car in our friend group because we were young about 16-17, and one of my friends did this when it was six of us crammed into a car. Instead of pedestrian, they yelled, \"DEER\", and I hit the brakes in the middle of the freeway, almost getting into an accident. Once we got to the place which was about 40 minutes of a drive away from where we lived, I acted like nothing was wrong with the rest of my friend group and gave the silent treatment to the genius who yelled deer. When it was time to go, and they were getting in my car I hit them with the \"What are you doing\", and told them that they needed to find some other way to get home. Nobody stayed with that friend, and it was about sundown. We never spoke after that again besides arguing about that situation. Whomp whomp, you wouldn't have cared if I got into an accident, destroyed my car, and got sued. Find your own way home. Call your mother honestly. People are assholes and need to take accountability for being assholes, you however, are not one of them.", "I did the same thing to a jokester friend who pulled my e-brake while I was taking a corner.  It swung the rear end of the car out and we skidded to a halt.  WHat if there had been another car there?  Or a person?  I kicked him out and made him walk.  I didnt give a F.  \n\nHe lost his right to a ride after that stupid stunt.  You dont mess around with safety.  What if you had caused an accident or fatality?  \n\n>but also implied that I might have overreacted by kicking him out of the car, especially since he never showed up to the event. \n\nCool,  so they can drive him and he can \"joke\" wth them while in the car.  NTA", "for real. maybe a very, very long walk will give him time to reflect on his actions"]}
