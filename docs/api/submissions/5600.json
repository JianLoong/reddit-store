Your spouse needs to choose, bc they can keep allowing you to feel persecuted against every time you visit. \n\nMy aunt was this way - my Christian dad married my jewish mom and we always got invited to Christmas at their home.

It was so obvious that my mom, dad, and little sister left before dessert. I have never gone back to their home. I have little/no relationship with that part of the family (20+ years) but I don't regret it, because when I do see them they mostly speak in pleasantries/updates  and otherwise keep their antisemetic mouths shut.
