She has been very demanding that her teenagers don't need toys or any gifts and want cash so they can buy whatever they want. Ok cool Im fine with this. Then I get calls from MIL, SIL and my partner making not so subtle hints that they think \"I am the Jew of the family\" and there better be a few 50s in there. I felt pressured by all and basically coerced into giving her kids $200 each (three kids) because her demands were very specific about what she wanted by the end of it all. Mind you all this time I made little talk about what my kids wanted it was mainly one sided, my partner reassuring me it would be two way and the favour would be returned to our kids. \n\nFast forward to Christmas I don't even get a thankyou and she took the $600 in envelopes happily, and all my kids got from her each was a $20 Smiggle gift card. I grabbed my kids and left the Christmas dinner. I know your supposed to be grateful and all with whatever you get, but i worked for 3 months saving that money that I felt I had to give, and I thought was excessive, in return for a joke? My kids get bugger all while hers are spoilt and she pockets both ways. I already went off at my partner for pushing me to comply with that situation.

Normally, I would say to be grateful for the gifts, but your SIL already broke that rule by demanding what her kids were to get beforehand. What she did was a cash grab, pure and simple.

I am not sure if you know that. That was very offensive what they said to Jewish people but also to you. They all applied pressure on you to give money yet SIL didn\u2019t return the favor. What was your partner\u2019s reaction to how your children were treated? I would be concerned about that especially since he put pressure on you. What did he gifted his niblings?
