Then I get calls from MIL, SIL and my partner making not so subtle hints that they think \"I am the Jew of the family\" and there better be a few 50s in there. I felt pressured by all and basically coerced into giving her kids $200 each (three kids) because her demands were very specific about what she wanted by the end of it all.

Your spouse needs to choose, bc they can keep allowing you to feel persecuted against every time you visit. \n\nMy aunt was this way - my Christian dad married my jewish mom and we always got invited to Christmas at their home. I noticed at a VERY young age that I was being treated differently than the other kids attending (fewer presents, no stocking, etc) and then one year when I was 9 or 10 the aunt sat my 4 person family in another room during dinner under the guise of \"not enough room at the main table\". It was so obvious that my mom, dad, and little sister left before dessert. I have never gone back to their home. I have little/no relationship with that part of the family (20+ years) but I don't regret it, because when I do see them they mostly speak in pleasantries/updates  and otherwise keep their antisemetic mouths shut.
