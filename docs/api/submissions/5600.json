Your spouse needs to choose, bc they can keep allowing you to feel persecuted against every time you visit. \n\nMy aunt was this way - my Christian dad married my jewish mom and we always got invited to Christmas at their home.

It was so obvious that my mom, dad, and little sister left before dessert. I have never gone back to their home. I have little/no relationship with that part of the family (20+ years) but I don't regret it, because when I do see them they mostly speak in pleasantries/updates  and otherwise keep their antisemetic mouths shut.

You partner too if he agrees.", "Do not ever interact with these horrible people ever again. They are not worth your time.", "This is fucking horrifying. Your kids shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near these people.", "So they are claiming that you need to spend more money on gifts becouse from historical perspective jews were known to do well with finance?\n\nWhy don't you gift them \"Schindler's list\" in that case?\nThey do not get to pick certain aspects from history while completely ignoring others.", "As a Jew in an interfaith relationship I\u2019m so sorry your in laws say that to you. Fuck them. Antisemites don\u2019t deserve presents let alone any interaction. If I were you I\u2019d cut off contact and if your husband gives you shit, ask him why he\u2019s so cool with his family being vile and antisemitic but not cool with you avoiding that. I\u2019m furious for you I\u2019m so sorry OP", "Does your husband like you?  I mean seriously - he pushes you to save and scrimp, and did what?  Apparently nothing.

Not to listen to this pair of siblings.", "So y'all are on a tight budget, have your own children, and your spouse still encouraged you to give $600? Plus you do all the finances and mental load? Nope! If you think it is saveable do some couples counseling.

Wouldn't be surprised if they got $20 each too.", "So you worked extra for your entitled SIL?  Nope.  Your husband needs to step up and defend HIS KIDS (and WIFE).

Grandma sat with me at a smaller table in the living room- it was a privilege to join us.  My mom joined us often.  Some of my other cousins on occasion. Never my truly crappy aunt (her daughter). Anyway- that is how a GOOD grandparents/family manage \"the kids\" table. You never kick a whole family out of the main room- how bizarre- what a trashy thing to do. I guess it was silver lining- they showed you who they were strongly enough you no longer had to deal with them!", "That would be perfect haha.", "This would be the perfect response.", "Yikes!
