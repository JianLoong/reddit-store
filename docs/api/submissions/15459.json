Come on!\u201d and \u201cWhy do I have to!?\u201d Whenever Max\u2019s parents get him a job, he gets fired on purpose.\n\nMax\u2019s parents just let him play video games because they don\u2019t want him to throw a fit. They\u2019ll ask Max once or twice to do something but won\u2019t actually put their foot down with him. They seem to just be hoping that after they pass, Max is gonna miraculously get his shit together and act like a grown-up. They clearly don\u2019t have a plan B. My parents have been clear with them that we will not be responsible for Max after they\u2019re gone.\n\nMax got into a car crash recently and was arrested for being under the influence. Because of the circumstances of the accident and the fact that this isn\u2019t his first DUI, Max\u2019s bail has been set at a massive amount. Max\u2019s parents begged the family for funds to help bail him out. Every family member except me offered money. I made an excuse that I needed my savings and couldn\u2019t spend any.\n\nMy friend Louise has a cat named Sugar. Sugar is Louise\u2019s emotional support animal. She\u2019s an actual registered service animal for Louise, she\u2019s helped Louise through so much and she is more than just an animal (not that it\u2019s ever \u201cjust an animal,\" by the way.) Sugar had to recently be rushed to the vet because she had kidney stones that were obstructing one of her renal tubes. I donated $3,000 to Louise because Sugar is her best friend.\n\nLuckily, Sugar has since made a full recovery. Louise made a post on Instagram and Twitter announcing Sugar\u2019s recovery and thanking me and the others who donated to help cover Sugar\u2019s vet bills. Louise\u2019s social media is all private, so I don\u2019t know how they found out, but Max\u2019s parents (and their friends/some closer relatives) are furious that I gave money to Sugar\u2019s vet bills but none to Max\u2019s bail.\n\nI\u2019ve had to shift all my own social media to private because they keep making new accounts to get past blocks. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to provide enough for Max\u2019s bail anyway, but they told me I was a horrible person, and that I let my uncle sit in jail while draining my wallet for some animal. Max\u2019s parents in particular are saying that they hope I will end up in jail as well so I can understand Max\u2019s position and have more empathy for him.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be required to give away my hard-earned money, including to my family. And, sure, jail isn\u2019t fun. But it\u2019s not as if Max is dying or being starved. Plus, it was his choice to drive under the influence. Sugar didn\u2019t choose to have kidney stones.

Fuck him.", "I\u2019m sure the feeling is mutual", "My cat is an escape artist. She has zero street smarts, but her lust for the outdoors is just too much. She will purposely sit stealthily and make a mad dash for the outdoors the second the door is open. \n\nBefore anyone opens the door, I am quick to remind them, \"Watch for the cat.\" Backpacks and purses have been used as a force field. \n\nOpen windows and we are pulling her off the screen. \n\nBut she is super loveable. Or at least pretends to. Makes biscuits all over my stomach or legs, but digs her claws in. I'm sure it is my punishment for not letting her enjoy her one true love - the outdoors.", "NTA. My mom and I were hit by an impaired driver who was on his second or third offence. Also refused the breathalyzer. \n\nYour uncle deserved to sit in jail. This time he didn\u2019t hurt anyone, but there\u2019s ALWAYS a next time for people like that.

But also you dont seem to know much about American jails. The odds of him being mistreated or seriously injured or yes even killed, depending on where he's incarcerated, are definitely are not zero.", "NTA.  You don't owe Max and his parents shit.  I'd straight up tell the family that Max could have killed someone and you want nothing to so with any of his enablers.\n\nI hope Sugar is okay.  I'm currently petting my own cat named Sugar.  She hopes her fellow kitty feels better soon", "NTA. It's your money. You get to decide how you spend it. Also, as many have mentioned, your uncle's situation is a consequence of his own actions.", "NTA. you\u2019re an adult who can choose where to spend money. Just like max is an adult who made the decision to drive.", "NTA. Your uncle voluntarily put himself in jail by driving under the influence and crashing his car. He is doing nothing to better his life. He deserves the consequence of jail. It\u2019s very likely he won\u2019t learn anything, and end up in jail again. \n\nHelping a friend save her pet\u2019s life is a worthwhile thing to do.", "Do your family members understand exactly why you are not in jail and cannot empathize with him?

Did your family ever tried to take him to a therapist ?\nI am asking this because I had a family friend who was an addict and it was very difficult for him to find and keep a job. \nWhen you described your uncle, it kinda reminded me of  this family friend. \nHe was an addict but wasn't a bad person, he just had a lot of problems and a very bad childhood with a neglecting and abusive family. \nI am not trying to say your uncle isn't responsible for what he did...I mean, he is not a child anymore, still if his family just let him do whatever he wants, or if their only plan was to find him some jobs and then say \"well, that's just how it is, nevermind\"...probably they're ignoring their son real needs. \n\nStill your uncle's family are big AH who should finally have a reality check instead of harrasing and trying to isolate you.", "NTA\nIt's your savings end of the story , you don't need to give an explanation of how are you going to use it.", "Sugar has a job she needed to get back to.\n\nMax had the time to sit in jail and think about what he did.", "You had your priorities right.  Your money, your choice.  Has helping Max in any way shown a positive result?  He could have killed innocent people by driving drunk.  You made the right choice and ae not the AH. kt", "NTA. Donating to a loved animal that will continue to make someone's life better over a drunk idiot who needs a lesson in life's realities and not be bailed out by anyone?  No contest and ignore the jerks that are ragging on you.", "NTA. you are a wonderful and generous friend for helping sugar. your friend had an emergency that could have been life threatening for her animal. max is an adult man responsible for the consequences of his actions. you made the right choice", ">but that my human uncle should have been prioritized over my friend\u2019s cat.\n\nNOPE. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope!\n\nNTA.\n\n>hope I will end up in jail as well so I can understand Max\u2019s position and have more empathy for him.\n\nHe doesn't need empathy. He needs some consequences, and to grow the eff up. Your family members are enabling your uncle, who is a danger to others. He is going to kill someone eventually.\n\nOk, I just saw the bit about this being his FOURTH?! DUI. I cannot express in words how much Max's parents and other enabling family members disgust me. I hope Max goes to jail for a VERY long time.\n\nOne more time: NTA", "NTA, enabling him would be worse.", "NTA it\u2019s your money. You can spend it how you want. Period.", "Nta", "NTA. Sugar was fixable for a couple of grand. The money would have enabled your uncle to continue as he had, learning nothing, being as irresponsible as ever. \n\nTell your relatives that their son's problems cannot be fixed with money. TBH, an extended stay in jail may be the opener he needs. And while he is enjoying the fruits of his \"labors\", a support animal is on the mend and back doing their job. It seems like a win/win to me.", "NTA. I am not even close to being a pet person, your family can f* right off. It\u2019s about time he faced some consequences for his actions. He could have killed somebody. Good on you for helping your friend.", "NTA. \n\nJail will be a *learning experience* for Max. A *valuable* learning experience, one he is less likely to repeat.

I didn\u2019t intervene when the world finally gave Max a real consequence that might prevent him from *risking countless lives* in future, and I helped my friend maintain access to a valued medical resource. In both Max\u2019s situation and my friend\u2019s, I was thinking about the wellbeing of people; it was just a bonus that I also got to help an animal in the process. The real question is, why are you so comfortable with enabling Max in likely someday killing himself and others, just so he can be comfortable today???\u201d NTA.", "NTA\n\nCat's irrelevant. You could've spent that money on hooked and blow if you wanted and it would still be NTA. They need to stop enabling this behavior.", "NTA no one is entitled to your money, least of all the deadweight of the family.", "Definitely NTA....But....very curious....you refer to \"Max's parents\"....are these your grandparents? Do you or your parents have a decent relationship with them? It seems like max has always been trouble and they are going to continue to enable him.

Or is he some honorary uncle?\n\nThey're not my biological grandparents, technically. Max is my aunt's brother-in-law.", "\u2026wow. Those details make him an even bigger AH, and his parents huge ones for daring to enable his behaviour! He deserved every single hour he spent in jail and more.\n\nGlad the 3 will be okay, but that poor woman.

They're your aunts.\n\nMost people wouldn't think of him as an uncle, just like you haven't referred to his parents as your grandparents. \n\nAnd also how the other grandparents of any extended cousins are not your grandparents.\n\nI'm saying that as someone who had a pretty good relationship with an uncle by marriage's extended family. I asked when I was a kid how we were related, and got told technically we weren't. People can build family relationships of course, with people who aren't blood or legal kin. \n\nBut in this case - \nThat they are stalking you online for this? \ud83d\ude32\nWell, you're already having to block them because they're being abusive towards you, congrats, I think that's a pretty good reason to cut off contact with them.\n\nNTA", "Soft mind I can see.

I try to warn her that she's butter and doesn't stand a chance against the street cats. \n\nBut damned if she doesn't run out whenever she can. A few days ago, she ran out on the porch and froze because one of the giant street cats was at the bottom of the stairs. This tiny floof decided to run up on this 15 lb tom cat. She ran straight at him with her little floofy paws flying and let out a loud RAAWR! \n\nShe chased him right out of the yard I had to scoop her up before he realized that her claws barely stick out past her fluffy paws."]}
