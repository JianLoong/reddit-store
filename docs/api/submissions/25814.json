However, you\u2019ll want to double check the rules at the hospital where you\u2019ll be delivering. I gave birth at the end of February, and I was allowed one support person. That\u2019s it.

It's not a social event. \n\nI just had my first baby last month, and you should be aware that most hospitals limit how many people you can have in the room - mine only allowed one (which worked out for me, as I only wanted my husband there anyway). This whole thing might be a non-issue since it's unlikely the hospital will allow you to have 4 people there. I'd research that before making any promises. \n\nRegardless, nobody is entitled to be there unless you want them. You're out on display basically the whole time, you'll be bleeding, you might poop/pee, you'll definitely be stressed, and there's always a chance that things won't go smoothly.

YOUR mom and sisters will be there for YOU, and that\u2019s who you are most comfortable with.\n\nOnce the birthing is done, focus will shift to the baby and MIL should be included ASAP because she is an important of a grandmother as your mom.

You should have who you are comfortable with only. You are the patient. \n\nWith that said please make sure your husband is your person first.

For sure check with your Dr/Hospital before telling anyone.  No sense in saying she\u2019s not allowed if it\u2019s irrelevant anyway because no one extra is allowed.  You may save yourself some drama!", "It's your choice, but I did attend my daughter in law and I just stayed at the head of the bed and saw nothing would step in the hall when checked, so that might be a choice. I also filmed for my son so he could be in the moment but just from the head of the bed", "NTA. Obviously.

The fact that he pushed his way out of her womb however many years ago does not mean a thrice damned thing in the face of your labor and delivery.  Being the egg donor who birthed the owner of the successful sperm gives her nothing in regards to your labor and delivery, and he best get it through his head right now that even being the owner of the successful sperm that brought about your pregnancy does not entitle him to anything either.

He does stick up for me sometimes with her, but I don't trust her since she's been disrespectful and undermining my authority. Yet does the same to her own son. Personally, some moms that only had 1 kid and that kid is a boy, they get too attached and want to make it about them since the men don't get as much attention as daughters in this situation. Dealt with it during my engagement, wedding planning and wedding, pregnancy announcement, baby shower and planning, and how it'll be during delivery.

You trust them with your secrets. They have proven that you can depend on them. In that room, if you tell someone to do something, it's not debate time, it's get in the boat and row time. Now your MIL is someone you get along with, and that's really great. She's sounds nice, but three things. \n\nOne: she has pushed what sounds like clearly communicated boundaries. When that happens, some trust is lost. I know it's not some heinous betrayal, but it demonstrates that she's unwilling or unable to respect your boundaries for something as simple as \"don't peek.\"  \n\nTwo: she's not your mom. That's it. This isn't Christmas or Thanksgiving, where MIL wants to help cook. This is a birth, and EVERYONE should respect the woman who has been growing a human, including DH. Stress for you is stress for the baby. And that's just not good. \n\nAnd lastly, and please understand my advice is worth every penny you're paying me. I would invite MIL to brunch or something where it's just the two of you. Talk to her about grandma stuff, get her opinion on a few baby things you don't care much about, and thank her for being so accepting of you and respecting your wishes. Some will say DH should handle this. I get that. But this isn't going to end well because DH needs a cranial rectal extraction, and dealing with two babies will be overwhelming for OP. \n\nI wish you and your family the best!", "Most hospitals, don\u2019t allow for it to be a group event they generally allow your partner and possibly one other person.", "NTA.  But,  I think it should really be just your husband, the rest can meet up with you in recovery.   It\u2019s a medical procedure, less people is just better for everyone.  Too many is just distracting and unnecessary, you will have amazing nurses that know the drill.", "NTA", "NTA, but guess what? It is completely possible that all sorts of people will be in there. I did not want my own mother there, but they refuse to ask her to leave, even though I tried my hardest. Then, they invited all sorts of student doctors and nurses in the room. I said no, but they were there (wanted everyone to watch a \"natural\" birth because they were so rare at that time). \nSo, just think about that and be clear with everyone well before you are giving birth, who you do and do not want in there. Also, I am sure that MIL may be disappointed, but likely would also understand?", "NTA at all. As an L and D nurse, make your wishes known. We will keep people out if that's what the patient wants. It's your delivery so you get to decide who is in the room.", "Your life, your body, your choice. NTA \n\nYour husband should respect you.", "Is your husband the one pushing out the baby with an exposed hoohaa? If not-he does not get a choice.\n\nIf he pushes back-ask him to and get in the same position as you on the ground with his Willy swinging around while your family and his mom is there and ask if he would be comfortable with your family seeing that. He\u2019ll get the point.", "Gross on her part wtf", "NTA. You\u2019re the one delivering a baby, you decide who gets to be in the room. You should feel utterly at peace and comfortable with every single person YOU decide gets to be there.", "NTA.\n\nThis is your pregnancy, your labour & your delivery. You are the only person who should saying who you want in that room with you.\n\nGood luck, enjoy your pregnancy and all the best for a safe (& drama free) delivery", "NTA. YOU decide who you want in the room when you give birth, no one else. There is no fair or unfair in this- absolutely no one is entitled to be in the room with you. Giving birth is messy, it puts us in an incredibly vulnerable state, and it is uncomfortable enough on its own. You get to pick the people you want with you to make that experience more comfortable.", "NTA and not wrong. \n\nYou\u2019re giving birth. It will be the most vulnerable time in your life. It\u2019s all about you and your comfort. You get to choose who is there.", "NTA! \n\nI had my sister at the birth of my twins - she\u2019s and ER nurse too! It feels good having someone like her as an advocate and support. \n\nYour mum is your mum. There\u2019s a bond there that MIL doesn\u2019t have. \n\nIn the end , you\u2019re the one giving birth. So it\u2019s your choice! \n\nShe may not completely stomp boundaries but she sure as hell tried to push them. It\u2019s not something you need to deal with whilst pushing a whole human out your vag.", "NTA, if your mother-in-law tells you she wants to be there be blunt and ask her why she wants to sit there and stare at your genitals.", "Not wrong", "NTA. You don't have to explain yourself.", "It's crazy how often they were post like this, and almost always one of the number one comments is that birth is not a spectator sport.\n\nYou are supposed to have who you are comfortable with, who's going to be supportive to you, and that you want to be there. Even if you weren't necessarily concerned with her ignoring your wishes, if you weren't entirely comfortable or on board with her being in the room in that vulnerable moment for yourself, that would still be entirely reasonable for you to not want her there, not necessarily for any negative reason.\n\nIt is much more common than some people think to not have your in-laws in the birthing room. The only person that was in the room when I and my siblings were born, where the doctors, my dad, and my grandma(Mom's mom)\nAt one point apparently, my father's parents did try to come to the room, and they were told rather forcefully to leave. Her reasoning was that she did not want my grandma to see her vagina. Entirely reasonable. If you do not want your mother-in-law to see your vagina, entirely reasonable.", "NTA Ask your husband of your dad and brother(s) can be there to watch the next time he has his prostate checked and has a colonoscopy. \n\nMake sure you let the hospital staff know that only your mom and sisters are allowed in the room with you. MIL may just turn up.", "Girl, I'm not even going to read your post past the first sentence. Your birth is ONLY about YOU. The easiest birth is still traumatic as fuck. If you didn't want your own husband to be in there, that is your right! Whatever is going to help you get through that experience is what you get no ands ifs or buts about it.\n\nNTA \n\nAlso, as someone who gave birth in the last year, it is OKAY to change your mind when the time comes. I originally just wanted it to be my husband and I, as I knew it would bring us closer together. When the time came, I called my mom crying and begged her to come over. I've heard of other women starting with their mom and then asking them to leave. I've heard some women kick out their own spouses.", "Lol. I don't think you're gonna be as insecure about your body by the time the baby is born. I swear everyone and their mother was up in my business \ud83d\ude02. I was being seen at a learning hospital, tho. \n\nI don't think you're the asshole. But it would be sweet if she could be in the room for her grandbaby's appearance... Only if you could find a way to be comfortable with it.", "Your vageen isn\u2019t an open air market, you get to make the rules. Could she be given a different role or special experience to claim so she still feels included?", "You're going to be in a very vulnerable state, why add stressors to that? If you aren't comfortable with her there, then don't have her there.", "I don't get it why you would have that many people around you when you are giving birth. I would go crazy. \nNot to sound offensive, but I just really don't get it.\n\nAnd you have so much time ahead to think about this, don't worry. You are only 11 weeks.\n\nBtw NTA", "It is entirely fair because you will need people around you who will keep you calm and level, not people who will have you worrying about what there looking at and why are the doing that and she keeps talking but I can\u2019t just tell her to shut up like I can my mom, who knows not to take it personally right now. You need to keep it to people who will not stress you out, even if it\u2019s on accident or they didn\u2019t mean to or it\u2019s just the way they are\u2026 your stress and your blood pressure are closely tied so it comes down to who will help you keep you BP low and boundaries intact.", "Totally get it. I chose to only have my husband for that reason and he told me from the start he wasn't ever going to look down during I asked why and word for word he said \"coz it's like watching my favorite restaurant burn down\" I shit you not I laughed so hard at that I almost peed. He was amazing tho stayed up top and held my hand and supported me both times.", "NTA, if you set personal boundaries.. I think they should be respected. you\u2019re the one carrying this child for over 9 months so i think you should be able to say who will be there at the birth.", "NTA. You dont even need the whole explanation. You can decide who is in the room. period. Point blank.", "NTA. To reiterate what at least one other has said - birth is not a spectator sport. It\u2019s about ensuring the person giving birth - you - is supported and safe. Only you get to decide helps you feel that way. No one is entitled to be present at the birth of your child. Not even dad.", "NTA at all", "NTA it\u2019s bizarre to me that so many people think giving birth is a spectators sport. Do they think there\u2019s popcorn to? It\u2019s an intimate moment and very messy (you might poop while giving birth do people really need to see that?) you need people who will support and comfort you and no one else.", "NTA. The mom makes all of the decisions. I didn\u2019t want anyone in the delivery room with me, barely wanted my SO there, lol. My baby came so quickly the doctor almost missed it.", "NTA. Giving birth is a medical procedure. Because you\u2019re the one going through the surgery, the only people who have to be there are yourself and the medical professionals. You don\u2019t have to justify your decisions to anyone. Remind her it\u2019s a privilege not a right or entitlement.", "NTA. Tell your husband he can have his mom there when he gives birth", "It\u2019s such a personal moment, why would you have anyone aside your husband/partner there? I love my mom and grandma but they understood that this was a personal moment, the birth of our child, that only my husband and I would be in the delivery room.", "NTA. Though it does sound like you have too many people. Your mom, two sisters, and presumably your husband. While it\u2019s your medical thing and your choice, and I think most people can understand you\u2019re more comfortable with those people seeing you naked, I could also see how your MIL and husband could see it as singling her out when you\u2019ve already got an audience of 4. That\u2019s not what you\u2019re trying to do, and you have a good reason. But it can easily look that way. \n\nObviously your husband should be there he\u2019s the dad. But do you really need your sisters? ER nurse or not, she can\u2019t jump in and get in their way and do it the way she thinks it should be done. If an emergency happens she\u2019s not going to grab a pair of gloves and save the day. The people in that area of the hospital deal specifically with birth all day everyday, they know more than your sister about that process. If you absolutely need her to feel relaxed, maybe just her and your husband? Maybe your mother as well if need be. That way you can easily say and show it\u2019s nothing to do with excluding MIL, and all to do with your comfort. I know people will disagree and say do whatever you want, which you can of course, but I can see why they would feel hurt when you\u2019re having 3 people from your side in. I understand comfort levels with your family, but it can look weird to her that you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want people seeing you naked but have 4 people watching. I absolutely don\u2019t think you should have her there because your comfort above all, I just think cut 1-2 people from the room to solve the issue the best you can.", "Exactly this! Wish I had a reward for you! \n\nMy friend gave birth and it was just me and her mum there, the father/sperm donor (who wasn't at the birth because he's an A) complained that she wouldn't let him bring someone! \n\nNTA.", "Loool loved this comment", "How did you forgive your husband? What a total betrayal on his part.", "Agree with this. Check how many you are allowed. I know some places don\u2019t mind but my hospital only allowed 2 support people during my first 3 labours and since covid have reduced it to 1 so my last delivery was just my me and my husband.", "And his MIL (her mother) in the room when the doctor palpates the old prostate, where there is a definite chance of him blowing his load. Ask if he wants her there then. Or even his own mother.\n\nOn second thought, don\u2019t add his mother to the question. Too much potential ick factor if he answers yes\u2026", "There are some vaccines that they cannot have before 6 months, so it\u2019s recommended that adults in regular contact with them get boosters. DTP is one, as well as covid and flu."]}
