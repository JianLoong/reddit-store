However, you\u2019ll want to double check the rules at the hospital where you\u2019ll be delivering. I gave birth at the end of February, and I was allowed one support person. That\u2019s it. Also, they only allowed two visitors at a time, during very specific hours, and no one under the age of thirteen, so I couldn\u2019t even have my older child come see me in the hospital. \n\nStand firm. People can come visit you once you\u2019re home with baby. Good luck!", "NTA. It's your moment, and you should have whomever you want at your bedside. You don't owe anyone any explanations.

It's not a social event. \n\nI just had my first baby last month, and you should be aware that most hospitals limit how many people you can have in the room - mine only allowed one (which worked out for me, as I only wanted my husband there anyway). This whole thing might be a non-issue since it's unlikely the hospital will allow you to have 4 people there. I'd research that before making any promises. \n\nRegardless, nobody is entitled to be there unless you want them. You're out on display basically the whole time, you'll be bleeding, you might poop/pee, you'll definitely be stressed, and there's always a chance that things won't go smoothly. Nobody has the right to add to your stress during a medical procedure. MIL and FIL need to check themselves.", "I get to choose who looks at my cooter. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBirthing (as a process) is about the mother, not the baby. YOUR mom and sisters will be there for YOU, and that\u2019s who you are most comfortable with.\n\nOnce the birthing is done, focus will shift to the baby and MIL should be included ASAP because she is an important of a grandmother as your mom.

You should have who you are comfortable with only. You are the patient. \n\nWith that said please make sure your husband is your person first.

For sure check with your Dr/Hospital before telling anyone.  No sense in saying she\u2019s not allowed if it\u2019s irrelevant anyway because no one extra is allowed.  You may save yourself some drama!", "It's your choice, but I did attend my daughter in law and I just stayed at the head of the bed and saw nothing would step in the hall when checked, so that might be a choice. I also filmed for my son so he could be in the moment but just from the head of the bed", "NTA. Obviously.

The fact that he pushed his way out of her womb however many years ago does not mean a thrice damned thing in the face of your labor and delivery.  Being the egg donor who birthed the owner of the successful sperm gives her nothing in regards to your labor and delivery, and he best get it through his head right now that even being the owner of the successful sperm that brought about your pregnancy does not entitle him to anything either.  He needs to understand that your labor and delivery is about two people:  You, and baby.

You come first in this scenario and regardless what anyone says, this event is about you until that baby arrives.

He does stick up for me sometimes with her, but I don't trust her since she's been disrespectful and undermining my authority. Yet does the same to her own son. Personally, some moms that only had 1 kid and that kid is a boy, they get too attached and want to make it about them since the men don't get as much attention as daughters in this situation. Dealt with it during my engagement, wedding planning and wedding, pregnancy announcement, baby shower and planning, and how it'll be during delivery.
