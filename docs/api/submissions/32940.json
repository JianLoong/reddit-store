We are now in our late 20s.  Stepdad focused a lot of his time providing for us so I never got close to him but I am grateful for him. I am engaged and my sister is going to marry in about a month. My wedding will be in a year. Both of us are close to our mom though.\n\nMy sister who I will call Noelle, fucked up in my opinion. At first I was on her side but now I just feel bad for stepdad. Noelle isn\u2019t going to have him walk her down and give her away. I understand this is her decision and when that came out I helped my mom and stepdad understand that it was her choice. The turning point happened last week when she told us that he will not be sitting at the family table, when asked her why she made it clear he wasn\u2019t family to her. Again her right but damn he is the reason we had such a good childhood and are debt free ( he paid for college and worked a ton).\n\nI knew this would result in them not going to the wedding and they informed my sister. She called me upset and was ranting about how it was her wedding. That she was being abandoned. I had enough and told her she is an idiot if she didn\u2019t think her actions wouldn\u2019t have consequences. She called me a jerk and hung up\n\nI am unsure if I was a jerk and I feel guilty since I am now closer to my parents since I promised he can walk me down at my wedding.", "created_utc": 1702476536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hhl9n/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_an_idiot_if_she/", "score": 10077, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our choice and no hard feelings on dad\u00b4s side. (In Germany many couples do the same as it is often considered an outdated custom and daughters are not a possession to give away. My DIL chose it anyway because she has a close relationship with her dad and wanted to honor him.)\n\nSo that is fine with me. But what makes your sister TA is to ban your stepdad from the family table. He provided for you for many years and you seemed to have lived amicably together. You need not love your stepparents but to humiliate him openly... TA\n\nAnd I *like* it you made it clear to her that this has severe consequences. How can an adult woman not see this??", "NTA,  \nYour sister needed a reality check.  \nSounds like she has some issues that need resolving.   \nQuestion - does he have biological kids that he treats better or is being distant just his personality.", "NTA. My step dad came into my life when I was already grown and moved out. You know where he sat at my wedding, yep, the family table. Why? Because he is my mums husband, he makes her happy, and that makes me happy. In your case, your stepdad took on a huge financial burden for 2 kids that weren't his, and yet your sister thought it was ok to humiliate him by relegating him to a nobody. You did the right thing, and I hope your sister gets some therapy.", "NTA.  Not having him walk her down the aisle is one thing.  Not great for the relationship, but fraught with all kinds of issues relating to your biodad, so it's understandable.\n\nBut not sitting him at the family table?

Not having him walk her down the aisle isn't the biggest issue. But not having him sit next to his wife at the head family table was a complete slap in the face. The man raised her helped her and was there her entire childhood. So she says he's not family to her and then complains about being abandoned. The question is who is abandoning her her not family.\n\nYour sister thinks she's immune to her actions and you are completely right in what you said, and your parents were completely correct and not going if she's going to insult The stepfather that way.", "NTA.  Your sister didn't mind him being family when he was paying the tuition bills.", "If the man didn\u2019t treat you badly paid for your housing and education, show the dude some respect. Fair enough, walking down the aisle may be a bit far but being included on the family table should be expected.", "NTA. Your sister certainly can do whatever at her wedding, but the consequences are hers to bear as well. She evidently used your stepdad and now is determined to blow up the family.

Sorry. As others have said, I sort of get the not walking down the aisle. It sounds like your stepdad did a good job and should be allowed to do that but as everyone has said it\u2019s her call.

But likewise it is up to the partner of someone not being invited to decide whether or not to go.\n\nI also wouldn't go to a wedding in my family if my partner wasn't invited.", "NTA.\n\nSo, in your experience, has your sister used other people and then cast them aside when she had no more need for them or is this an honor reserved for your stepdad?\n\nIs your fianc\u00e9 welcome at the family table or is he also being relegated to \"not family?\"", "Your sister felt abandonned, but how does she think your step dad feels?

I thinks it really Strange so place a couple at different tabels.", "NTA. For all the reasons already said.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s pretty shitty of your sister to do this because it also hurts your mother by not allowing her to sit and enjoy the day with her husband.", "NTA. I can only imagine how she treats others if that's how she treats her parents.", "NTA - sounds like he was her parent when it came time for paying bills and blowing 100k+ for college though.

That is overboard!\n\nYour sister may not see him as family, but he is her mothers husband. She should respect that! But I guess her feelings are stronger then wanting a stable relatioship with her mother, that she is willing to blow up just to stick it to stepdad...\n\n...who paid for her education and provided since she was 8!\n\nI'm sorry to tell you but your sister seems like an ungrateful brat! The fact that it's her wedding doesn't give her cart blanche to be disrespectful to her mothers marriage!

My reservation is this: I think you should also refuse to go. This man stepped up to provide for y'all, and went far beyond what a basically good stepfather would be expected to do. No one could fill the hole of your sister's idolization of your dad, not even your dad if he had lived. But she not only refused stepdad the role that is traditional for a father if he can do it, but she insulted him further by refusing him a position that would normally be accorded a parent's spouse. He's not mom's sidepiece, he is her long time husband and he worked hard to be as much a father as the two of you would allow. Your sister is being evil, and you should have no part of it - don't attend.", "NTA but reconsider going yourself. Your sister is being cruel for no reason. She\u2019s happy to pretend and take stepdad\u2019s money but god forbid she treat him with respect. She\u2019s hurting your stepfather and mom and I wouldn\u2019t indulge her", "NTA.

You should boycott the wedding also.", "NTA, he doesn't have to give her away or anything, but if nothing else he's your mother's husband - sister should have at least had the decency to let stepdad sit with mom, that's where she crossed into AH territory", "It\u2019s her decision to make but she will have to accept that certain decision have lasting consequences.

Her wedding and her choices but like said they have consequences.  Your parents also had the choice and they choose not to be there as she completely disrespected your Stepdad who by your account did his best.

He supported her during her childhood, he paid for her college and has treated her as family for the last decade.

You spoke a truth that she needed to hear. I hope she heeds it before it's too late.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If he isn't family than he has no obligation to be at the wedding, and neither does his wife.

It sounds like this man has been attempting to be a father figure to her for roughly 20 years and only NOW does she decide that he's not family?\n\nYou are absolutely NTA.

Please offer your stepdad a beverage of his choice for my condolences for having such an awful stepdaughter.", "Had she not considered having an extra seat at the family table reserved for her dad instead and have his pic there? Wouldve been ideal imo. If she felt like she needed that. I feel its really mean towards your mom also, this is the man that has taken on the father role since the loss and sounds like he wholeheartedly embraced it so have him cut off like that like a total stranger is heartless.\n\nLink her this post. Maybe she will reevaluate her choices and sincerely apologises. Your stepdad doesnt have to walk her down the isle.

We are now in our late 20s.  Stepdad focused a lot of his time providing for us so I never got close to him but I am grateful for him. I am engaged and my sister is going to marry in about a month. My wedding will be in a year. Both of us are close to our mom though.\n\nMy sister who I will call Noelle, fucked up in my opinion. At first I was on her side but now I just feel bad for stepdad. Noelle isn\u2019t going to have him walk her down and give her away. I understand this is her decision and when that came out I helped my mom and stepdad understand that it was her choice. The turning point happened last week when she told us that he will not be sitting at the family table, when asked her why she made it clear he wasn\u2019t family to her. Again her right but damn he is the reason we had such a good childhood and are debt free ( he paid for college and worked a ton).\n\nI knew this would result in them not going to the wedding and they informed my sister. She called me upset and was ranting about how it was her wedding. That she was being abandoned. I had enough and told her she is an idiot if she didn\u2019t think her actions wouldn\u2019t have consequences. She called me a jerk and hung up\n\nI am unsure if I was a jerk and I fell guilty do that fact I am now closer to my parents since I promised he can walk me down at my wedding.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But her choice to exclude him from sitting next to his wife at the reception was a \u201cf-ck you\u201d move.  Not only was it hurtfully disrespectful to him but to your mother as well.
