Her first marriage ended around the same time she found out she could not have children. This was a huge blow for Kate (the not being able to have biological children not the marriage). She spent a few years on herself and decided that she didn't need to be a bio mom to have children. 12 years ago she met her second/current husband Jeff. Jeff was a single father by choice. He had two surrogate conceived children who were in their teens (15 and 13) when they met and 15 and 17 when she married Jeff. Kate was eager to be a mom to those kids and I asked her if she felt, given the family dynamic Jeff and his kids had, that would be possible? She said those kids never had a mother and they would be crying out for one.\n\nThis was not true at all and the kids have never recognized Kate as a mother or parent to them. They are polite and all those things you expect but I doubt they love her and she is not recognized as a mom or a parent to them.

Even if she WAS being reasonable, you can still support someone without being \"upset\". Otherwise most care workers would never be able to do their jobs :P", "NTA.  Kate really should have brought those expectations up with the son MONTHS before the ceremony.  I just don't see how she can he this delusional about the situation, does Jeff just feed her lines about the kids to avoid drama?", "NTA\n\nthose kids were never going to see her as parent, they never had a mother and didn't need one. They only ever saw her as their Dad's new wife.\n\nGiven the dynamic she was never going to be involved in the wedding as anything other than as a guest.\n\nShe wanted something so much she blindsided herself.", "NTA. She wants you to tell her a lie. She needs to grow up and stop letting what she wants cloud her judgement. Sure it might be hard to admit she might have married some one for the wrong reasons, but thats life.  Also Jeff is a AH for not letting your sister know before hand, surely he would have known or at least discussed it \n\nOn a side note its probably me being ignorant but this is the first time i've ever heard the \"single father to surrogate by choice\" scenario.", "Info- what kind of support would you want in her position?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kate just has unrealistic expectations for this too", "NTA, your sister is projecting her infertility feeling on those kids, but there were already teens when they met, they dont need a mom anymore on that age. Your sister needs to get some professional help for her feelings. It is completely unrealistic for her to think those 'kids' will ever see her as a mom, and she needs to accept that, her feelings are not healthy and if she keeps this unrealistic idea she will only hurt herself", "humans have their own mind and dont all think alike. thats probably the case for at least 70.000 years b.c. but who knows maybe some ppl can read others. or so they think. NTA", "Not that I know. I think she simply never got rid of the idea that they needed a mom and since she was the only one offering, that is what she would be.", "Me personally? I want to be told the truth that I'm being unrealistic and should consider working on that. I was told that before by a very amazing friend who was my best support at the time. I know Kate would not appreciate that though.", "Moi", "Moi", ">She said those kids never had a mother and they would be crying out for one.\n\nwhy would they?, they never had one and I assume that Jeff gave them a lovely and stable home to his kids, she's delusional to think that they would see her as their mother when they've been on their own for almost all of their lives.\n\nNTA, your sister needs some serious help to accept her reality.", "Kate needed that reality check.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Yet another step-parent who expects to just waltz in and immediately take over a parental position without regard for the thoughts or feelings of children. Sister was totally selfish in her outlook without any regard for the feelings of those kids. She certainly would have alienated them even further with her ham handed insistence on being a mother they did not want. What happened at the wedding was completely foreseeable to anyone who was not delusional. Expecting others to sympathize when she set herself up for exactly what happened is yet again being selfish. She needs to get a grip on reality.", "NTA for refusing to feel her delusions.", "In my opinion, you need to be supportive of your sister, because she's hurting.  It doesn't really matter whether or not she had a great chance of being her step-children's \"mother\" - she really wanted that connection.  \n\nShe has the right to feel sad about this, regardless of whether this was anticipated or not.  \n\nTelling her \"I told you so\" would be cruel and not helpful.", "NTA. But I kinda feel like Jeff is a little bit of TA. My mother remarried when I was in college. If I had to describe my immediate family, I would include him even if he was never a father figure to me. I can understand not having a mother/son dance with someone who wasn't a mother to you, but your parent's spouse is family. I think your sister is being unrealistic, but this feels like being publicly shunned and I can understand why she's hurt.", "ESH.  Some situations you have the choice to be right or kind.  You chose right.  When what she wanted was kindness.", "Nta", "NTA. Mom is earned, not given.", "No. She needs therapy for her infertility trauma yesterday. NTA", "NTA. She's an idiot.", "NTA, what she was expecting was unrealistic.\nI could only really see YTA if you were to continuously shove \"I told you so\" down her throat.\nHonestly irritated me when she got mad at you for apparently not looking upset enough for her.\nNTA.", "On the flip side, if she has forced this relationship on to both the kids I can also understand why they might resent her.", "NTA, since when did your sister think it is anywhere near appropriate to expect everyone to cave in to her demands", "She was delusional to think teenagers would grip to her like they were infants. It\u2019s sad, but if she wanted kids and couldn\u2019t conceive, she should have considered adopting or foster to adopt kids who do really want and need a parent- not just latching on to someone else\u2019s children and hoping to have a role she wasn\u2019t entitled to. NTA", "At the risk of ruining a nearly perfect INFO comment above by making the point explicit, I wonder if she would've preferred that you just tell her how sorry you were that she was hurt, and how you hurt for her.\n\n(I agree with OP, I'd rather understand what was going on in my head and how to avoid future hurt, but everybody's different.)", "That would have been the most sympathetic thing to do. If the kids are old enough to marry, the stepmother ship has sailed long ago, and acknowledging Kate's sadness is not going to lead to any unwanted 'parenting.'", "She might have been the only lemonade stand on the block.  But that doesn't mean anyone was obligated to buy a cup no matter how cute she looked behind the card table."]}
