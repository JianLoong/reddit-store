Her first marriage ended around the same time she found out she could not have children. This was a huge blow for Kate (the not being able to have biological children not the marriage). She spent a few years on herself and decided that she didn't need to be a bio mom to have children. 12 years ago she met her second/current husband Jeff. Jeff was a single father by choice. He had two surrogate conceived children who were in their teens (15 and 13) when they met and 15 and 17 when she married Jeff. Kate was eager to be a mom to those kids and I asked her if she felt, given the family dynamic Jeff and his kids had, that would be possible? She said those kids never had a mother and they would be crying out for one.\n\nThis was not true at all and the kids have never recognized Kate as a mother or parent to them. They are polite and all those things you expect but I doubt they love her and she is not recognized as a mom or a parent to them. Kate has convinced herself that the kids love her and when they'd get married she'd be the mother of the groom and mother of the bride.\n\nJeff's oldest, his son, got married recently. Not only was Kate not mother of the groom but during the wedding he chose to do a father/son dance while his spouse did their dance with their father.

When the family was announced during the wedding it was \"Father of the Groom, Jeff, and his wife, Kate\" kind of thing.\n\nKate's has been having a very hard time accepting this. She's emotional, she feels like she was blindsided and was crying to some of our family members about it. I was there but was not offering her a shoulder to cry on. Honestly, I feel like this is all a result of her being very unrealistic and she has ignored all the signs of her being just Jeff's wife to his kids.

Even if she WAS being reasonable, you can still support someone without being \"upset\". Otherwise most care workers would never be able to do their jobs :P", "NTA.  Kate really should have brought those expectations up with the son MONTHS before the ceremony.  I just don't see how she can he this delusional about the situation, does Jeff just feed her lines about the kids to avoid drama?", "NTA\n\nthose kids were never going to see her as parent, they never had a mother and didn't need one. They only ever saw her as their Dad's new wife.\n\nGiven the dynamic she was never going to be involved in the wedding as anything other than as a guest.\n\nShe wanted something so much she blindsided herself.", "NTA. She wants you to tell her a lie. She needs to grow up and stop letting what she wants cloud her judgement. Sure it might be hard to admit she might have married some one for the wrong reasons, but thats life.  Also Jeff is a AH for not letting your sister know before hand, surely he would have known or at least discussed it \n\nOn a side note its probably me being ignorant but this is the first time i've ever heard the \"single father to surrogate by choice\" scenario.", "Info- what kind of support would you want in her position?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is completely unrealistic for her to think those 'kids' will ever see her as a mom, and she needs to accept that, her feelings are not healthy and if she keeps this unrealistic idea she will only hurt herself", "humans have their own mind and dont all think alike. thats probably the case for at least 70.000 years b.c. but who knows maybe some ppl can read others. or so they think.
