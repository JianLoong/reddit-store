Her bio mom is not in the picture and he and Everly are very close as a result of that. Everly has some serious health issues. I won't say what they are out of respect for her privacy but she's in and out of the hospital and is being monitored almost 24/7 at home. \n\nEverly was just in the hospital and came home yesterday. When my husband took her home, he got distracted with a work call and I was with our 3 month old so my mom got her something to eat and tucked her in for a nap. When my husband was done with his call he went into Everly's room to check on her. She was supposed to be asleep so he didn't knock because he didn't want to wake her up. When he went in Everly dove under the covers and told him to get me or my mom. He got me and I checked on her and gave her meds. She explained that she kicked my husband out because she was topless and panicked when she came in (she had a shirt on by the time I came in). She and I talked about it then I went to tell my husband that everything was fine and she wasn't mad. I explained the situation to him and he was relieved that he hadn't done anything wrong and that she wasn't upset but he was confused why she was comfortable with me coming in when I've only been in her life for 3 years, especially when she's never been uncomfortable with him before. \n\nI told him that she's 14 and things are changing and she might want to talk to me about certain things and she might change her mind on what she's comfortable with. That night she was feeling nauseous. When that happens someone will give her nausea medicine and sit in the bathroom with her until the feeling passes. My husband almost always does this but last night she only wanted me. \n\nI went back to bed after she went to sleep. My husband was still awake and, after checking to make sure she's okay, started saying that he can't believe she's starting to pull away from him. I was a little frustrated (it's been a really long week) and told him to get over himself and that their relationship is fine. I reminded him that she just spent 2 hours curled up in his lap while we watched a movie. \n\nHe didn't say anything after that and he's been a little distant today. I feel bad but I also think he needed a wakeup call. Everly still loves him a lot and it's perfectly normal for her to want her mom (she's been calling me mom for a little over a year now) in certain situations as she gets older.

I imagine there will be more incidents like this in the future, as she starts dating, moves out, etc.\n\nBut I don't think you're the AH either, especially since Everly obviously loves you and feels comfortable with you, but I would apologize to your husband for what you said, and try to be more understanding. It's not about \"getting over himself,\" it's about realizing their connection is changing and all the little things that entails. It's probably hitting him pretty hard, and a little compassion will go a long way.", "You need to realize something, OP. \n\nHe's facing the biggest reality check a father could have. *His daughter is growing up.* His little girl, his little baby he probably bounced on his knee is becoming a woman and no longer needs him the way he wanted her to need him for much longer. \n\nThat kind of realization is a big shock for a parent, especially between a loving father and his daughter. It's a nightmare come true. It's inevitable and every parent knows that day will come, but they never quite wish for it, either. \n\nIt's at this time, that you need to give him some time to process it, because to him, it feels like the child he knew is no longer that child and he's facing a brand new reality and for that kind of father, it's rough. \n\nBe easier on him. Yes, their relationship will probably be fine, but be a little more sympathetic towards the dad realizing his baby is no longer a baby. \n\nSlight YTA.", "NTA. At some point, dads will only understand so much. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to talk to someone that has gone though the same physical and mental changes. \n\nHe needs to remember that she\u2019s going to want to talk to women sometimes over him.", "I\u2019m waffling between N T A and E S H. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s normal (plus everyone should always knock on closed doors! Knock lightly if someone may be sleeping because if they\u2019re not\u2026voila!)\n\nBut come on, you were pretty callous with the delivery. Your husband is human. Doesn\u2019t sound like he was making it an issue for his daughter (she\u2019s not responsible for his parenting feels) nor has it been an ongoing issue. He expressed, to his wife, his surprise at the change and maybe a little hurt. It\u2019s ok that things are changing. It\u2019s also ok that he has feels about that. As long as he\u2019s working through them without making it daughter\u2019s issue or obsessing about it. It doesn\u2019t sound like this has been an ongoing problem at home so I\u2019m not sure why you chose \u201cwake-up call\u201d over empathizing with your partner. Would you want him to empathize with you when you get your feels a little hurt about something, admittedly small and totally expected?\n\nI think a better route would be to reassure him (she loves you!) and remind him it\u2019s a huge positive for kids to have more than one caring adult in their life, and a gentle reminder that it\u2019s not a competition and it\u2019s great she\u2019s warming up so much to stepmom. Also a stern reminder that closed doors are establishing a boundary. Knocking, even lightly, is required. \n\nNow if he keeps dragging out the same complaint, or barging in daughter\u2019s room, then wake up call away!

Your husband expressed fears that his growing child is pulling away. He\u2019s not just scared of losing her to health issues but losing the close bond they shared. Feelings aren\u2019t rational so dismissing his fears by saying he should get over himself is a bit of an AH move. My advice is to apologize for trivializing his feelings, reassure him that his daughter still loves and needs him, and that you and her getting closer doesn\u2019t mean they are growing apart and how much of a great thing it is that she feels so comfortable with you now and can can help take on some of the work required to make sure that little girl is as well taken care of as possible", "NTA. Sometimes a girl just wants another female around her. It doesn\u2019t mean she loves her dad any less. But there\u2019s some things a young woman is not comfortable talking about (initially at least) with her father. I realize this is not true for every daughter, but they both need to realize she\u2019s growing up and they must let her navigate her own path in a way that\u2019s comfortable to her. Dad is realizing his daughter is growing up. Mom needs to understand that dad\u2018s going to get that big truth right upside the head whether he wants it or not. Mom will have the rough part because she needs to be supportive to them both. Until things level out.", "Sounds like you were insensitive to his insecurity about his relationship with his daughter. A gentle YTA, because you absolutely are doing the things the teenager needs in the moment and that's arguably more important than assuaging the fears of a grown man, I wouldn't be telling anyone to get over theirself when they've exposed a personal fear to me.", "NTA but I guess he hat to care for her most of her life  and isn't used to get pushed away YET. I mean it's the same with moms who spent years being there for their kids and now have to learn to let them go.\n\nI guess you should appologize for not seeing his needs and emotions as well. It's new to him . Just tell him that she is growing up and will need more independance and female guidance and ask him what he needs to get use to his new situation. If she needed almost 24/7 monitoring then his whole life was focused on her so changes also inpact his routine. Of course he needs to understand that his daughter is growing up but he also deserves time to process the change and not be told to get over it It's like someone dies and ppl tell you get over it . He did ti for YEARS so help him to get use tot he new norm without telling him he shall get over it.", "NTA, of course she's going to pull away from her dad at times. It's normal for a teenage girl to want to talk to her mom about things instead of her dad.", "NAH, Husband is a little thick in the head though.", "YTA. he quietly and privately expressed dismay and concern about his relationship with his daughter and you told him to shut up. why exactly did you feel the need to dismiss him like that? how hard would it have been to say \"i don't think she's pulling away honey, she's just having a hard time right now\"? why was that your immediate response?", "NTA  But he is slowly coming to the realization that she is becoming a young woman and that will be an adjustment lol.  He'll be fine :)", "NTA and I love how gracefully you handled the situation with Everly! Although a lil bit of patience helps your husband through the transition I think ;)", "NTA, but he and Everly need to talk.", "NAH", "NTA\n\n\nHe seems to be getting upset and even questioning the length of time you have been there compared to him.  He should understand that his teenage daughter may need a mother figure sometimes and should be glad she has that with you \n\n\nI would honestly ask him to go to therapy, her illness has taken a toll and he needs to understand that he has you too in both their lives and you aren't trying to overstep him at all, your trying to help and help when requested.", "NTA because you didn't do anything wrong. He should talk to his daughter about how he's feeling, and he should be happy that she has a mother figure again.", "Soft YTA. That\u2019s his baby, he\u2019s just realizing that she\u2019s growing up and it\u2019s a huge adjustment. I understand why he would be upset. But you shouldn\u2019t have told him to get over it, that was a bit harsh.", "You are a tiny bit TAH.  You are really bonding with her.  After reading some people in this sub, I applaud that.  She is growing and changing.  Here\u2019s the problem-You told a man who has single-handedly raised a very ill little girl to get over himself.  This is a huge change in their relationship and, even if he had to know it was coming, it still is going to hurt.  He has cared for her and been there and her life has not been easy.  Their closeness will change and he is dealing with that.  Be as understanding with him as you were with her.", "NTA. \n\nYou're husband is a little though, mostly for commenting that he doesn't understand why she would be comfortable with you coming in when you've \"only\" been in her life 3 years. 3 years is a lot for a child, and it was enough time for you two to have a child of your own, as well. If she's comfortable enough calling you mom, why wouldn't she be comfortable with you coming in?", "NTA", "NTA, let me first say it\u2019s a good sign that she calls you mom. Perhaps you can be a little bit more supportive to your husband instead of brushing him off to get over himself.", "NTA. Nor is he. That is wonderful that she has been calling you mom for the last year. \n\nAs others have mentioned, I think your husband is just confused and worried that Everly is pulling her away. For years it was just the two of them.  Everly just needed a comfort from her mom and is now modest in front of her dad. I take it she has started her menses? And I am sure you are the one to take her bra shopping. It's only natural that she is now being modest. So your delivery was a little harsh after a stressful week but not YTA worthy. I would apologize to him and explain to him that Everly is now a young woman. That she will ALWAYS be his little girl but there will more times where she would prefer your comfort and advice than her dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
