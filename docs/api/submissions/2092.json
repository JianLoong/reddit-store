Her bio mom is not in the picture and he and Everly are very close as a result of that. Everly has some serious health issues. I won't say what they are out of respect for her privacy but she's in and out of the hospital and is being monitored almost 24/7 at home. \n\nEverly was just in the hospital and came home yesterday. When my husband took her home, he got distracted with a work call and I was with our 3 month old so my mom got her something to eat and tucked her in for a nap. When my husband was done with his call he went into Everly's room to check on her. She was supposed to be asleep so he didn't knock because he didn't want to wake her up. When he went in Everly dove under the covers and told him to get me or my mom. He got me and I checked on her and gave her meds. She explained that she kicked my husband out because she was topless and panicked when she came in (she had a shirt on by the time I came in). She and I talked about it then I went to tell my husband that everything was fine and she wasn't mad. I explained the situation to him and he was relieved that he hadn't done anything wrong and that she wasn't upset but he was confused why she was comfortable with me coming in when I've only been in her life for 3 years, especially when she's never been uncomfortable with him before. \n\nI told him that she's 14 and things are changing and she might want to talk to me about certain things and she might change her mind on what she's comfortable with. That night she was feeling nauseous. When that happens someone will give her nausea medicine and sit in the bathroom with her until the feeling passes. My husband almost always does this but last night she only wanted me. \n\nI went back to bed after she went to sleep. My husband was still awake and, after checking to make sure she's okay, started saying that he can't believe she's starting to pull away from him. I was a little frustrated (it's been a really long week) and told him to get over himself and that their relationship is fine. I reminded him that she just spent 2 hours curled up in his lap while we watched a movie. \n\nHe didn't say anything after that and he's been a little distant today. I feel bad but I also think he needed a wakeup call. Everly still loves him a lot and it's perfectly normal for her to want her mom (she's been calling me mom for a little over a year now) in certain situations as she gets older.

I imagine there will be more incidents like this in the future, as she starts dating, moves out, etc.\n\nBut I don't think you're the AH either, especially since Everly obviously loves you and feels comfortable with you, but I would apologize to your husband for what you said, and try to be more understanding. It's not about \"getting over himself,\" it's about realizing their connection is changing and all the little things that entails. It's probably hitting him pretty hard, and a little compassion will go a long way.", "You need to realize something, OP.\n\nHe's facing the biggest reality check a father could have. *His daughter is growing up.* His little girl, his little baby he probably bounced on his knee is becoming a woman and no longer needs him the way he wanted her to need him for much longer.\n\nThat kind of realization is a big shock for a parent, especially between a loving father and his daughter. It's a nightmare come true. It's inevitable and every parent knows that day will come, but they never quite wish for it, either.\n\nIt's at this time, that you need to give him some time to process it, because to him, it feels like the child he knew is no longer that child and he's facing a brand new reality and for that kind of father, it's rough.\n\nBe easier on him.

I never said that. I said that it's a reality check to come to the realization the child is no longer using training wheels. It's both a wonderful, amazing thing and can also be harrowing because you know that child you raised is ready for the real world, and the real world can be scary, too. A parents instincts are to protect and to feel important and to want to be that person the child leans on. If a parent wants to restrict a child from this - yes, that's an issue. But it is a natural wish for a parent to want to be there for their child and to know their child no longer needs them anymore can lead to an adjustment period.\n\nAnd please don't @ me or anyone else for the nightmare comment stating what a real nightmare would be. I didn't intend it to be as taken out of context as it was. So goes the saying though, just because someone has it far more difficult, doesn't make anything else any less difficult for someone else. You wouldn't tell someone who said they're tired, \"Oh, *you're* tired? Try staying up for 24 hours, etc.\" Just because they're more tired, doesn't make the other person any less tired or their feelings any less valid. #end rant", "NTA.

As long as he\u2019s working through them without making it daughter\u2019s issue or obsessing about it.

Feelings aren\u2019t rational so dismissing his fears by saying he should get over himself is a bit of an AH move. My advice is to apologize for trivializing his feelings, reassure him that his daughter still loves and needs him, and that you and her getting closer doesn\u2019t mean they are growing apart and how much of a great thing it is that she feels so comfortable with you now and can can help take on some of the work required to make sure that little girl is as well taken care of as possible", "NTA.

I mean it's the same with moms who spent years being there for their kids and now have to learn to let them go.\n\nI guess you should appologize for not seeing his needs and emotions as well. It's new to him . Just tell him that she is growing up and will need more independance and female guidance and ask him what he needs to get use to his new situation. If she needed almost 24/7 monitoring then his whole life was focused on her so changes also inpact his routine.

This is a huge change in their relationship and, even if he had to know it was coming, it still is going to hurt.  He has cared for her and been there and her life has not been easy.

That is wonderful that she has been calling you mom for the last year. \n\nAs others have mentioned, I think your husband is just confused and worried that Everly is pulling her away. For years it was just the two of them.  Everly just needed a comfort from her mom and is now modest in front of her dad. I take it she has started her menses? And I am sure you are the one to take her bra shopping. It's only natural that she is now being modest. So your delivery was a little harsh after a stressful week but not YTA worthy. I would apologize to him and explain to him that Everly is now a young woman. That she will ALWAYS be his little girl but there will more times where she would prefer your comfort and advice than her dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is growing up and it is awesome that you can step in and be a good female role model.\n\nI think you should be the one to break the tension and admit you were a bit harsh. Start the discussion with him that she is growing up and some things are better left between you and her but it doesn't change how she feels about him.", " YTA but only bc you could\u2019ve been gentler and more empathetic towards your DH. \n\nYes, he probably should realize that there are going to be times that Everly will want to speak to/confide in another female rather than her Dad as she matures, but it was likely a shock for him to have to realize that and it could\u2019ve been handled better imo. I would also hazard a guess and imagine they are even closer than many fathers and daughters due to her mom being gone and her medical condition. \n\nI know you have a lot of your own plate having an infant you\u2019re taking care of right now but just put yourself in his shoes and apologize for not being more aware of the issues he may have with the changes coming as Everly matures into a young woman. \n\nInstead, I\u2019d suggest (as others have) that you sit down with him and try to explain how things may be altered over the next while when it comes to privacy issues but that it doesn\u2019t mean that the love between daddy and daughter has to (or will) change.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nEveryone\u2019s wound up (who wouldn\u2019t be?) and maybe being a little short with each other.  You all sound generally like good humans but everyone can get testy.  It\u2019s just life.  It\u2019s nice to know the daughter has you both.", "NTA. Could\u2019ve worded it better though", "She needs a woman to help her understand her own body. Your husband is being immature and needs to learn how to think.", "I say NTA to both, neither of them are in the wrong here \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.  It\u2019s nice you let him know to knock in future because she wants privacy and that\u2019s understandable and expected.", "NTA But,\n\nYou were tired. Your delivery of info to him was quick, and without feeling. Just frustration.\n\nAddress the issue again, with him, but this time tell him gently, and be open to questions. Let him know you are there for him. \n\nDo this sooner than later.", "NAH.", "I'm just gonna say, coming from an adult that was a very sickly child, in and out of the hospital, it drove me insane when my parents wouldnt respect my privacy. Because they always took care of me when I was sick, they thought they had a right to my body any time, any place, and also couldnt grasp the fact that I was growing up and was not comfortable with them having unlimited access to my body and personal space whenever they felt like it.\n\nNTA OP, I'm not close to my parents anymore and rarely speak with them because they couldnt get over themselves and realize I was growing up. It *was* creepy when my dad would cry that I wasnt his little girl anymore because I wouldnt.....allow him to come into the bathroom while I was using it.", ">just because someone has it far more difficult, doesn't make anything else any less difficult\n\nYes! I say \"it's not the pain Olympics, we aren't competing for who has worse trauma!\" I have severe trauma from my childhood and I STILL want to hear when my friends have issues they feel \"aren't as bad\" as what I went through. I say that is BS, all issues and trauma are valid and deserve to be heard.", "Awww shit. I\u2019m a grown ass married woman but I\u2019ll definitely be calling my dad just to say hi and chat tomorrow. I was the biggest daddy\u2019s girl and I\u2019ve never thought about him going through the \u201cnightmare come true\u201d like that. I love him so much but need to tell him that much more often.", "Pretty wild seeing an \u201casshole\u201d tag based on a comment that justifies objectification of the daughter, disrespect of her boundaries, this offputting claim that seeing your children grow up is a \u201cnightmare,\u201d and complete non-acknowledgement of the OP\u2019s own stress taking care of a young infant while also caring for a disabled teen, whom she graciously and lovingly provides such good care for that the stepdaughter feels comfortable and safe requesting her help. OP\u2019s husband should be thrilled to have found a partner who makes his vulnerable daughter feel secure and comfortable at such a confusing time in her life (14 being in the throes of puberty).\n\nOP you are absolutely NTA and ignore anybody so out of touch and with such a distorted worldview as to say otherwise.", "If I\u2019d just known that last Little League game was the last one\u2026", "Sound like it's always been them two against the world for the longest while, and given his daughter's illness that's gonna apply an order of magnitude more. Is it common sense? yes. But that doesn't change his feelings or initial reactions and the callousness of her reaction. His she some horrible monster? No, she was likely just frustrated that he couldn't see something so obvious. If we switched the Genders I think most people would rightly take into account women's emotions, sadly men's emotions are often ignored, mocked, or met with disregard.", "He thought she was asleep, and he was checking on his medically fragile child!", "Yes I had massive depression as did my sibling.  It wasn\u2019t strange for either of our parents to burst into locked doors if we didn\u2019t answer.  The thought of finding us dead outweighed the privacy when it came to us.  That\u2019s what dealing with chronic pain/illness etc is, there\u2019s more severe outcomes.  Like death or what have you", "I think it has more to do with being pushed away, even tho it's reasonable.", "Yep and as OP described they are really close. His daughter is likely his world so seeing her pushing him away even when it's reasonable still hurts. If he is a great as a father as OP implies I pretty sure he will come to understand, doesn't make it any less difficult tho.", "Or maybe it still hurts to be pushed away even when it's entirely reasonable. Especially given the relationship and the illness.", "If it was a 14 year old boy you'd knock for sure, given how frequently they masturbate.", "And you spend years taking care of them with them being totally helpless.  They grow up and don\u2019t even remember that, but you are well and truly conditioned."]}
