Her bio mom is not in the picture and he and Everly are very close as a result of that. Everly has some serious health issues. I won't say what they are out of respect for her privacy but she's in and out of the hospital and is being monitored almost 24/7 at home. \n\nEverly was just in the hospital and came home yesterday. When my husband took her home, he got distracted with a work call and I was with our 3 month old so my mom got her something to eat and tucked her in for a nap. When my husband was done with his call he went into Everly's room to check on her. She was supposed to be asleep so he didn't knock because he didn't want to wake her up. When he went in Everly dove under the covers and told him to get me or my mom. He got me and I checked on her and gave her meds. She explained that she kicked my husband out because she was topless and panicked when she came in (she had a shirt on by the time I came in). She and I talked about it then I went to tell my husband that everything was fine and she wasn't mad. I explained the situation to him and he was relieved that he hadn't done anything wrong and that she wasn't upset but he was confused why she was comfortable with me coming in when I've only been in her life for 3 years, especially when she's never been uncomfortable with him before. \n\nI told him that she's 14 and things are changing and she might want to talk to me about certain things and she might change her mind on what she's comfortable with. That night she was feeling nauseous. When that happens someone will give her nausea medicine and sit in the bathroom with her until the feeling passes. My husband almost always does this but last night she only wanted me. \n\nI went back to bed after she went to sleep. My husband was still awake and, after checking to make sure she's okay, started saying that he can't believe she's starting to pull away from him. I was a little frustrated (it's been a really long week) and told him to get over himself and that their relationship is fine. I reminded him that she just spent 2 hours curled up in his lap while we watched a movie. \n\nHe didn't say anything after that and he's been a little distant today. I feel bad but I also think he needed a wakeup call. Everly still loves him a lot and it's perfectly normal for her to want her mom (she's been calling me mom for a little over a year now) in certain situations as she gets older.

It's a nightmare come true. It's inevitable and every parent knows that day will come, but they never quite wish for it, either. \n\nIt's at this time, that you need to give him some time to process it, because to him, it feels like the child he knew is no longer that child and he's facing a brand new reality and for that kind of father, it's rough. \n\nBe easier on him.

As long as he\u2019s working through them without making it daughter\u2019s issue or obsessing about it.

Would you want him to empathize with you when you get your feels a little hurt about something, admittedly small and totally expected?\n\nI think a better route would be to reassure him (she loves you!) and remind him it\u2019s a huge positive for kids to have more than one caring adult in their life, and a gentle reminder that it\u2019s not a competition and it\u2019s great she\u2019s warming up so much to stepmom.

Feelings aren\u2019t rational so dismissing his fears by saying he should get over himself is a bit of an AH move. My advice is to apologize for trivializing his feelings, reassure him that his daughter still loves and needs him, and that you and her getting closer doesn\u2019t mean they are growing apart and how much of a great thing it is that she feels so comfortable with you now and can can help take on some of the work required to make sure that little girl is as well taken care of as possible", "NTA.

I mean it's the same with moms who spent years being there for their kids and now have to learn to let them go.\n\nI guess you should appologize for not seeing his needs and emotions as well. It's new to him . Just tell him that she is growing up and will need more independance and female guidance and ask him what he needs to get use to his new situation. If she needed almost 24/7 monitoring then his whole life was focused on her so changes also inpact his routine. Of course he needs to understand that his daughter is growing up but he also deserves time to process the change and not be told to get over it It's like someone dies and ppl tell you get over it .

She is growing and changing.  Here\u2019s the problem-You told a man who has single-handedly raised a very ill little girl to get over himself.  This is a huge change in their relationship and, even if he had to know it was coming, it still is going to hurt.  He has cared for her and been there and her life has not been easy.  Their closeness will change and he is dealing with that.  Be as understanding with him as you were with her.", "NTA. \n\nYou're husband is a little though, mostly for commenting that he doesn't understand why she would be comfortable with you coming in when you've \"only\" been in her life 3 years. 3 years is a lot for a child, and it was enough time for you two to have a child of your own, as well. If she's comfortable enough calling you mom, why wouldn't she be comfortable with you coming in?", "NTA", "NTA, let me first say it\u2019s a good sign that she calls you mom. Perhaps you can be a little bit more supportive to your husband instead of brushing him off to get over himself.", "NTA. Nor is he. That is wonderful that she has been calling you mom for the last year. \n\nAs others have mentioned, I think your husband is just confused and worried that Everly is pulling her away. For years it was just the two of them.  Everly just needed a comfort from her mom and is now modest in front of her dad. I take it she has started her menses? And I am sure you are the one to take her bra shopping. It's only natural that she is now being modest. So your delivery was a little harsh after a stressful week but not YTA worthy. I would apologize to him and explain to him that Everly is now a young woman. That she will ALWAYS be his little girl but there will more times where she would prefer your comfort and advice than her dad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you saying that just because they engaged in a thoughtful conversation about it before, it\u2019s okay to dismiss him in those late hours in the evening, when emotion overtakes logic? \n\nIf my partner was really struggling with something emotionally \u2014 that we\u2019ve already discussed at length \u2014 I\u2019d NEVER be like \u201cokay WOW, we *already talked about this.* How are you not over it already? WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT.\u201d \n\nEmpathy shouldn\u2019t have conditions or an expiration.", "You need to get over yourself.  The Dad maybe didn't realize she was topless because he thought she was asleep when he walked in.  You are acting like he purposely was trying to see her topless and he can't fathom why she wouldn't want him to see her in a state of undress.  Like he is some stupid ogre.  That is not why is was acting sad and confused.\n\nHe is a Dad having a tough time with his daughter, who has had health issues and he is uber protective of, growing up suddenly.  His wife dismisses his feelings with a \"get over yourself\" and you are just fine with it.  You sound heartless.", "if that were the only incident mentioned in the post, sure. but it's not.", "no she didn't. OP had a conversation where she explained that the daughter was topless and that's why she didn't want him there. that's addressing the immediate, \"i think my daughter is mad at me\" fear. the conversation later, of \"im worried she's pulling away\" is different! and even if it wasn't different, \"get over yourself\" is still a dismissive and cruel response.", "Being emotional over your daughter growing up and pulling away from you is not a pity party.", "You are missing the entire point. He walked in and thought she was in bed. He will probably knock from now on. He is not upset about not getting to walk in and that is a pretty sick take. Ever had a chronically ill family member? Those kind of boundaries become way less important when you are a medical caregiver for someone. His wife was cold and needed to consider both of their feelings.", "You don\u2019t get to shit on your partner sharing their feelings just because you\u2019re tired", "She also maybe didn\u2019t get a lot of privacy in the hospital with her body also.", "Same wtf", "Right, I was confused when I read that thought I missed something", "No offense dude but this really isn\u2019t about you and you\u2019re having an absolute meltdown.", "I am. I love love love that my kids are growing up. They've become such excellent people and just keep on getting better every year.", "You know some strange people then. Most parents I know understand the job is to raise a functioning adult.", "He didn't barge in he thought she was asleep (she had been \"tucked in\".  I don't knock when I think my kids are asleep because I don't want to wake them.  I am sure the Dad will knock next time.\n\nThe \"Get over yourself\" comment was very hurtful since the Dad is going through a lot too.  His daughter just came home from the hospital, remember?", "> He absolutely needs to get over his belief that she doesn't have a right to bodily privacy because he has feefees.\n\nyou literally invented this lmao. nothing in the post suggests he feels this way at all.", "If he's going to treat those kinds of boundaries as way less important because he's a medical caregiver, he's going to find she turns to someone who treats her with more respect. As is happening. As is 100% predictable for her age. There's no surprise there.", "Bet you're single huh?", "That's a really good point. OP should teach her husband how to knock and then WAIT for a \"Come in.\"", "That's also probably a big factor.\n\nI'm in my 30s but have had to have a bunch of exams lately, many of which required people to see me topless. I'm not particularly modest but having 10 people stare and touch you while you're exposed like that is unnerving.", "It is almost like you should treat your children like humans isn't of objects!", "This has nothing to do with the walking in. He is upset at being replaced in a role he has done forever. It is natural and it comes suddenly. This isn\u2019t about boundaries. This is about a person telling another person their feelings and being told to get over it.  Thing says he wouldn\u2019t adjust to this change. He just thought he was safe to  express his loss to his wife. Obsession with the nudity is a little creepy.", "That's something that really bugs me... people who knock and then just open the door.  I didn't say come in, didn't even get a chance to get to the door even.  Or, someone knocks and when you say, \"Yes?\", they think that's an invitation to open the door.  No, it wasn't.  I was asking what you were knocking for!", "Naah, I do understand people wanting their little babies staying little longer. I've had a hint of that couple times while packing away baby clothes. But it's not something I feel. I like my kids getting bigger and more independent and having their own thoughts and ideas how the world works or should work etc.", "Obsession with justifying him walking in on a 14-year-old girl without knocking is what's creepy. Seriously creepy.", "Feel nostalgic for what you once had is normal. Calling your child becoming an adult \"a nightmare come true\" is not the same feeling you are describing in my opinion.", "Yeah that\u2019s\u2026super toxic. Like do these people not realize that your child NOT growing up is the nightmare?"]}
