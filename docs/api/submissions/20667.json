At some point I told the (now ex) groom to be that he's very open minded to marry SIL when she used to have an OF account and even used to be stalked by crazy users in the past. Well, apparently her fiance didn't know about her OF account, so you can imagine all the drama that created between them. My SIL ended up crying and running away and my husband (28M) tried going after her, but his twin brother stopped him and told him that this whole situation is his fault for bringing that troublemaker (referring to me) to the party. I told him it's not a surprise that he's up for covering up someone's past considering what's in his and that made both him and their mother go off at me and my husband. We ended up leaving in order to get away from my husband's crazy family, but he ended up blaming me for uncovering my SIL's past to her fiance. I told him that if she would've been upfront with him from the start, then none of this would've happened, which finally silenced my husband.\n\nUnfortunately his family wasn't silenced and after my SIL's fiance called off the wedding, they started blaming us (mainly me) for ruining her engagement party and relationship altogether. My husband wants me to apologize to her for what I said, but I obviously refused, just cause she comes from a family enabling bad actions that doesn't make them right nor should they be further coddled. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1687800857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jnprt/aita_for_exposing_my_sil_for_using_an_of_account/", "score": 907, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly YTA.", "YTA.. \n\nWhy would you bring that up?

It's your SIL's choice what she does in her free time, and it doesn't matter if her family is \"enabling\" her behavior, it's her body and she can choose to share it if she wants. Besides, you mention that this was in the past, and bringing up the past to ruin someone's relationship is low. \n\nI'm kinda thinking this is fake cause there's just no way someone can be so misguided, and that someone can be so nasty without realizing what an asshole they are.", "YTA.

In a vacuum, or a more progressive timeline, that would all be second nature.\n\n*however.*\n\nWe\u2019re here and now. And there\u2019s a lot more going on. First off, online sex work is *intensely* private, just like a person\u2019s regular sex life is. Making a comment like that at a party is *at best* as classless as mentioning one of your SIL\u2019s sex toys - none of that is anyone\u2019s business unless *she* decides to share about it. Second, what if the groom already knew this and was assisting her? In that case you wouldn\u2019t have torpedoed the marriage, but you sure would have looked tacky as hell for bringing it up like hot goss.  Third, now you\u2019ve outed her to her whole family, and no matter how awfully they\u2019re behaving about it, *you did that to her*. She had no control over this narrative and now the very closest people to her have this information without her consent. That\u2019s not just rude.

Everyone sucks", "So if your partner doesn\u2019t know everything about you you\u2019re withholding information? Again, it is literally impossible to go over every single detail of your 20+ years of life with your partner before you\u2019re married. It\u2019s not withholding, it just hasn\u2019t been discussed yet. Unless there is something you did **to** your partner (like cheating) it doesn\u2019t need to immediately be addressed. People have their whole lives to get to know each other.", "I completely disagree. It\u2019s the responsibility of the person who has the dealbreaker.", "Would you be upset if you had a traumatic experience and someone told someone else about it? It wasn\u2019t OPs to share. I\u2019ve been held at gunpoint before when I worked at a service job. I don\u2019t like to tell people in person because it\u2019s traumatic. If someone who knew that about me told someone else I would be absolutely crushed.", "Still not her place to air out that out. She went there with an agenda.\n\nAnd we don't know if this OF was before they even met. Which it sounds like it is", "That\u2019s not necessarily true, OP could have found out any number of ways without SIL telling each other, and I disagree about it being a common dealbreaker. I don\u2019t personally know anyone who would find that a dealbreaker. I\u2019ve had friends who have done sex work and if it ever came up no one ever had an issue with it.", "Yeah for sure she\u2019s not gonna be married much longer", "What does it have to do with having children?", "I personally think both are a bit fucked up considering the exploitation aspect of it - but that\u2019s neither here nor there. A partner has the right to know and not be withheld information like that\u2026 \nI\u2019d want to know if my partner plastered their butthole all over the internet for $3.99 a month off strangers", "You can't consume porn and then shit on the people who make it", "100 bonus points for your comment! So incredibly true!!!!!", "I\u2019m going to say that you seem fun crazy, after all, you\u2019re admitting to it.  \ud83d\ude0a", "Of course he deserved to know. But OP is still the asshole because it wasn't her place to tell him, she chose a horrible setting in which to tell him, and she had nothing but bad intentions. She didn't say that because she was looking out for the fianc\u00e9. She said all of that specifically to cause a scene.", "Again. That is none of OP'S damn business. Nothing about that situation involved her. She inserted herself into a situation for the sole purpose of causing problems. I don't know why people are trying so hard to defend her shitty behavior.", "If their own brother, mother, etc all kept their mouth shut maybe it's not OPs place to bring it up? He can both deserve to know, and it not be her place to tell him.", "It wasn\u2019t OPs decision to make.", "I'm sure he has a sexual past. You're telling me he never sent a nude or received a boobs pic from a former lover? Why is this any different? Because she got paid?", "Are you kidding? \ud83d\ude02 if it was truly an altruistic move, she would have done it *before* the party. Stop acting like she\u2019s the patron Saint of honesty, she\u2019s just a nasty, petty person who thrives on drama. She wasn\u2019t doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d she got *exactly* what she wanted. \n\nHad this post been about how she couldn\u2019t handle keeping the secret so she contacted them, maybe I could see this. I might not agree but, I don\u2019t have to: it\u2019s not my relationship or my family, and that\u2019s none of my business.  (Which is why I personally wouldn\u2019t inform them, but I don\u2019t have any problems with it, they apparently very much do. I do think fianc\u00e9 deserved to know, way ahead of this.)\n\nIn short, if you think OP did this out of the good moral fiber of her heart, maybe once she gets a divorce, you should reach out. People like her love those of you that can\u2019t get a bead on their motives.", "There were a thousand other ways to do it. OP is an AH for going for \"maximum effect\".", "Exactly. OP knows OF is taboo, hence the \"you're so brave\" backhanded compliment. Brining up a taboo topic in public regarding one of the party hosts is an asshole move, full stop.", "I wonder how long she had been holding on to that little tidbit, waiting for juust the right moment.", "Yeah dishonesty is the dealbreaker", "Bingo. Doing sex work isn't something you keep a secret from your SO.\n\nI don't blame the groom for calling it off. Not telling him is a major breach of trust.", "I have to agree with this.\n\nThere's no conceivable conversation that could have naturally led to a conversation about OF or anything in that wheelhouse without OP specifically bringing it up.\n\n\"so open-minded\"\n\n\"At some point\"\n\nif it was a natural conversation, I feel like OP would include that. Usually leaving out info and details is something people do to make sure the situation sounds better.\n\nOP,\n\nYTA because your husband is literally just asking for some sort of apology for bringing this up. Just an apology, not even like compensation for the wedding.", "yup. although I do understand how shame makes people hide things from their past.\n\nSometimes you don't want to be deceptive, you just feel ashamed.", "OP said \"in the past\".\n\nAs in, not current.\n\nNothing implies she was a sex worker at the time. OP is a big time asshole, and if they really felt this information so urgently needed to be shared there are thousands more tactful ways to handle it than publicly at a party because they're thirsty for all the attention right up until it turns against them.", "I've never visited OF, but even I know that camming isn't the only thing it's used for. A quick Google indicates that approximately 70% of the creators create NSFW content. I guess that 30% are just damned to hell by association, huh?", "Not in the fake world though, no sir.", "I hate how everyone now acts like you have to fine with your partner sleeping around before you or doing sex work. No I don\u2019t. That\u2019s the beauty of personal preference", "Its also normal to not date people that feel they can dictate your past, like they're buying you with no previous owners.  \n\nYta op, outting sexworkers can not just destroy their lives but put them in physical danger.  You're awful.", "OF doesn\u2019t automatically mean sex work.", "If it was relevant than yes, I could see bride mentioning it, but she didn\u2019t. So it didn\u2019t need to be said at all. OP is the major asshole. It\u2019s not her relationship she ruined, but her BILs. OP should stay in her own lane and deal with her own relationship than ruin someone else\u2019s.", "Um no actually they\u2019re not. Only 70% of the content on OF is NSFW", "Leaving out a very controversial job is not a small thing. Maybe something someone should know within one year of dating in my opinion. Especially before marriage because it can be a deal breaker for many. Anything that is a form of our carnal urges should be disclosed to those who you plan to spend your life with, from drug use (past/present), sex work, relationships within the family, trouble with the law. These are sensitive things that anyone with respect for their SO should inform them of. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s real shitty to not inform the love of your life that your body is on the internet for whoever pays", "Did you just compare having an OF to something as traumatic as what you've been through, you're being  quite dense...", "I mean I agree it shouldn't have happened at the engagement party, but how else does the poor fella find out? The rest of them sure weren't going to tell him.", "Well yeah, it isn\u2019t necessarily true because we are both speculating information that isn\u2019t actually in the post itself.\n\nThat being said doing pornography is definitely one of the more common deal breakers out there; not everyone is as open minded as you or your friends. I certainly don\u2019t know many people who would be ok with that.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine someone would just coincidentally stumble across online porn of their relative. It\u2019s way more likely that she told her family when talking about what she does for a living.", "Eventually this kind of stuff catches up with you and everyone sees it. Kids are ruthless imagine your classmates mother being all over the internet naked that\u2019s traumatising. And not fair to the fella if that\u2019s a dealbreaker to him. It would be for me - do you think that\u2019s wrong of me? \n\nEither way - the fact she\u2019s withheld it is proof enough she\u2019s not exactly proud of it and doesn\u2019t want him to know\u2026", "She did it for the wrong reasons but it doesn\u2019t matter if it doesn\u2019t directly involve her. The other party deserves to know", "So whose place does it become to tell him when the aforementioned party won\u2019t tell him?", "That doesn\u2019t answer my question. \nIf SIL decides to never tell him, he should never know? No one should never tell him?", "Public vs Private", "Yes. Sending a nude to a significant other is different then being a stripper. Just like having sex with a significant other is different then being a prostitute. I am sure people would like to know if their partner used to be a stripper or not. And yes OF is the 21st century form of being a stripper.", "Because it's public... Are you seriously comparing having an OF to private nudes?", "I agree, the language was intentional.  OP knew what she was doing here", "It's not dishonesty, it was in her past. Do you disclose all of your former employers to a new partner? SIL is not obligated to disclose the fact the she had an OF account to anyone if she didn't want to do so,  her fianc\u00e9 included. That was her business to disclose not OP and not in a public setting like an engagement party.  OP is a colossal AH!", "It's not dishonest to have an OF in the past. It's weird and gross that folks demand a full accounting of their partner's sex lives like this.", "Sorry, being a sex worker in the past is a deal breaker for a lot of people. The SIL should have made it clear instead of marrying someone who thinks sex work is bad.", "Lol. The post is obviously about sex work. If she had an OF for her knitting then that would have cleared the incident right up.", "I've known a lot of women that have started OF and I can tell you that none of it was SFW.  Who tf even subscribes to a sfw OF?  I have questions about these SFW content creators?  Is anyone subscribing?", "If SIL did SFW stuff she would have told her fianc\u00e9 and there would be no drama.", "So... 70/30 she created nswf content. I don't think there's anything wrong with it but based on context and your own statistic. She probably was camming", "Lol online everyone pretends like it's fine but if you touch grass and do a poll, you'll get a different answer. This isn't really surprising?", "None of the women freaking out here would date a male sex worker or a man who saw a sex worker.", "Yea. It is fair to have preferences and the op is an asshole.", "It does in this situation.", "Ok. The SIL was nsfw.", "If it's pre-relationship why does it matter? It's still not her information to share.", "Not my or your place to decide, and definitely not OP. If they also wanted to tell them, they could have done so privately and confidentially - rather than in front of the entire family right before they got married. You can both be doing the \"right\" thing and still be an asshole.", "Literally nothing is private on the internet if someone is sufficiently dedicated. You really need to know this.", "Ofc, I think everyone agrees that OP is the AH. At the same time I don't agree with your logic that OF is just another employer, lets not kid ourselves here. And yes, I would say things like body count are no one's business but having worked in the sex industry is a very different thing and should be brought up.\n\nBut to each their own I guess. But if someone hides the fact that they had an OF account by saying its none of their partners business while also knowing their partner would not have been with them if they knew this fact makes it clear its not really about having a past.", "You get to choose your partner based on whatever factors are important to you. So does everyone else.", "It's a deal breaker for misogynists, you aren't speaking for everyone here.", "OF isn't necessarily sex work", "Not married, are you?", "Got em lol", "This post made me lose my virginity /:", "I'm a woman and would never judge a guy for being a sex worker in the past, or having seen a sex worker. As long as they used protection and it was in the past.", "Yes we would/do, but nice try I guess.", "How do you know that? Did you follow her?", "Everyone has boundaries/deal breakers.", "Apparently he found it to be a big enough deal to call off the engagement. It's not a big deal to you but it is for some people, so they deserve to know in my opinion. I would appreciate if someone told me that about a partner.", "No. If you\u2019re actively hiding information like that then it is OPs place to say something. She did it for the wrong reasons and in the wrong situation, but the ex-groom deserves to know, and if he\u2019s not getting told by the people that should tell him then they can\u2019t complain when someone else does it.", "Why though? \n\nWhy is whistleblowing someone\u2019s shitty behaviour frowned upon? This idea that because you\u2019re not the victim you should comment. \n\nIf someone saw your partner cheating on you, they should stay silent because as an outside party they shouldn\u2019t tell you?\n\nWhere is the human empathy and compassion for someone being lied to and manipulated into a relationship. To have their time and money wasted, to be given potential trauma and shatter their trust in partners? \n\nThat sort of mentality is honestly just a cowardly way of not having to think of other people. We live in a society and we should strive to help our fellow human being when we can.", "It is..and not saying the OF would-be bride is correct in having kept it from her would-be husband but what the prospective sil did was awful.", "But it is in this story...", "Yes it is. OF is strictly sex work, stop trying to justify it", "Found Abby Shapiro's alt account!", "That doesn't really have any relevance, does it?", "Based on that photo of you, I doubt it", "No, I just have a brain", "Almost everyone has secrets they don't tell their s/o.  This is no different.  It is not the SIL place to give out this infomation and the manner is which they did it is insane.", "Yeah the way it was done was obviously to shit stir, if she genuinely cared she could\u2019ve done it at a less public occasion 1 on 1.", "OP hasn\u2019t specified what sort of content was being made. It could have been all solo, clothed, feet videos for all we know", "Nothing wrong with it, even when it is", "Several influencers/celebrities have used OF to communicate with their fanbase in a nonsexual manner. Just like some use patrion. While it may be majorily used for sex work, it is not exclusively sex work", "Why would they need to justify a job?", "Justify what? There's nothing wrong with nude modeling. You're acting like the entire platform is just hardcore porn.", "Lmaooo", "You seem boring bro", "No matter if she was knitting or getting tied up doesn\u2019t make a difference though? Your statement was wrong and so was OOP\u2019s. There is nothing wrong with doing porn and since she doesn\u2019t even do it anymore it shouldn\u2019t matter to anyone", "Agreed.", "It's still selling sex though isn't it?", "Ok. I am sure the SIL specified that and cleared things up.", "Not objectively but he is allowed to decide for himself what deal breakers are for him and that's clearly one of them.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with it but it is absolutely sex work", "What a load of shit. Please stop talking. You are just saying things to say them.", "If that was the case here, the marriage would probably still be happening.", "By saying there is nothing wrong with it is justifying it.", "Nude modelling and porn are the same thing.
