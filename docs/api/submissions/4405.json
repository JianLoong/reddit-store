You have the right to choose what you wear and to not be pressured to remove your hijab, especially in the presence of a man who is not a family member. It is not fair or respectful for Rachel's mom to ask you to remove your hijab, and it is not appropriate for her to have a panic attack over your choice of clothing. You have not done anything wrong by refusing to remove your hijab, and it is not your responsibility to make Rachel's mom or boyfriend feel comfortable. It is Rachel and her mom who are acting inappropriately and unfairly, and you are not the a-hole for standing up for your beliefs and boundaries.", "NTA. If the woman has so many issues that a teenage girl wearing a hijab can't be in her house, just, wow. The much greater likelihood is that she's just being racist. Please have an absolute meltdown if anyone named Chris,  Christine, Christopher, Christina, or any variation of those comes in your house and wail about how a cross/crucifix/saint's icon on a necklace makes you feel unsafe. Does that sound ridiculous? So does the mom's behavior. Time to quietly remove yourself from Rachel's presence. The mom's behavior and the presence of the male in the house tell you this is NOT someone you want to be around.  Sounds like at least one of the other girls gets this. Drop Rachel from the study group and/or contact the others and form a smaller, saner group.", "NTA. Mom felt threatened by fabric. What a loser.", "So NTA.  Rachel is TA, so is her mom.  How on earth would she be threatened by a headscarf?  If there was a religious Jewish man in attendance would she be \"threatened\" by a *kippah*?   This is just bullshit Islamophobia.\n\nYou're better off not having anything to do with someone like that.", "I didn\u2019t need to read past the first three sentences before I knew my verdict. You are absolutely NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need the ignorant bigots in your life.", "You are no kind of AH. \n\nThis woman is an Islamophobe and frankly you would justified in calling her out publicly as one. \n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through this. I'm Jewish, not Muslim, but I'm familiar with getting really AH reactions to things related to religion (clothing, food choices, etc). It is the most horrible feeling. And it sounds like you were really abandoned by people yiu thiught were friends at the same time. \n\nI am so, so sorry this happened. Stay strong in your faith. Wear your scarf like the crown it is. They are the ones who will be the poorer for not having you in their lives.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re really racist! And honestly telling a woman to remove a piece of clothing and constantly insisting is a bit messed up and is harassment!", "NTA. Rachael seems to care a whole lot about what makes everyone comfortable, except you. You are right to stand your ground and defend what makes you comfortable. If you are not welcome in their home because you choose to wear a headscarf, so be it. Rachel\u2019s home isn\u2019t the place for you. Stay away from her and her mother.", "NTA. Rachel & her mom are liars for claiming no men were in the house & bigots for refusing to respect your religious practice.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry you were put in this situation. This is disgusting treatment from others. They were disrespectful and islamophobic and/or xenophobic. I hope you are able to find better friends and ugh. You were not in the wrong, and should be allowed to express yourself and your faith without such terrible treatment from others.  Again, NTA.", "NTA \n\nSo they were more worried by your headscarf  than by the ninja boyfriend who suddenly appeared out of nowhere after Rachel swore he was not around?!!?", "NTA.

Not yours. You don't have to suck it up to please other people.", "NTA.  You are not responsible for the bullshit inside her head.  She should go see a therapist about her weird mental Thing that she has going on.  And also turn off whatever schlocky so-called news source she probably has playing in the house all day/scrolling endlessly on her phone.", "NTA. Report Rachel and her mom is this is an assigned study group so you can switch. This is pure Islamophobia and discrimination.\n\nI have Reynauds syndrome and often wrap a scarf around my ears/head in the winter to stay warm. Would mine have caused a \u201cpanic attack\u201d for her mom? I doubt it.", "NTA. But you'll have the last laugh because people who have panic attacks because they saw a scarf are too delicate for this world.\n\nETA: It's too bad she's not allowed to be around you anymore because it would have been fun to host the study group at your house and tell Rachel that your house rule is that people named Rachel may only study after cleaning the whole house top to bottom. Wearing a scarf.", "NTA. It's absolutely inappropriate for them to ask you to remove a garment.", "Weaponized bigotry at its best. Who knew that a couple of yards of fabric on your head could inspire so much terror! Can you imagine how traumatized they must be going into a clothing store in the winter? \n\nThe horror! Scarves! Scarves everywhere! The mannequins are wearing them! THE MANNEQUINS!\n\nNTA. Your friend and her mom have some serious issues if you wearing a scarf caused them to panic. That\u2019s just absurd.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a strong supporter of \u201cyour house, your rules\u201d, but I draw the line at xenophobic rules.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to justify WHY you wear your headscarf.  It\u2019s of religious significance to you, and that\u2019s literally the only thing that matters.  You\u2019re not hurting anyone by wearing an article of clothing that matters to you.", "NTA\n\nKeep your distance from Rachel and her family. They're islamophobes feeling threatened by a piece of fabric, and they're disrespecting you by insisting you take off what clearly is important to you. It's your choice to wear the hijab, and it should be your choice when you take it off. Don't let anyone talk you into doing something you don't want. No matter what it is.", "NTA\nThey are discriminating against you. You did nothing wrong, and I would recommend reevaluating your friendship with Rachel if she is willing to lie in an attempt to trick you into violating your religious beliefs.", "NTA They are extremely rude and inappropriate. This is blatent islamophobia.", "NTA - I am so sorry you were treated like that!!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\n\nThey were being absolutely disrespectful to you (a guest in their home)! They knew that her boyfriend was there. And then to have the audacity to say that her mom was having panic attacks over you wearing a scarf on your head?? \n\nThat is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Many men and boys wear baseball caps inside peoples homes. So what is the problem with a guest wearing a hijab or scarf? \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you were treated like that!

Stay away from them because they\u2019ll hurt you", "NTA.\n\nRachel is a member of your study group, so she knew you wear a hijab. I'm not muslim, but I talked with some women in our neighbourhood and they explained that they only take it off at home and when alone with women, next to never when visiting houses of \"strangers\".\n\nAnd sorry, I can't imagine how the mother can get a panik attack or the BF felt threatened. That is bs. I would understand feeling cross when they asked you to take off your shoes (normal here in Germany) and you would decline. But a hijab? Never. And it looks like Rachel won't be a part of your study group anymore. That is a win.", "NTA.\n\nThis just screams racism....\nGood for you OP sticking to it!", "Nta\n\nTell the racist witch that you are fine with never coming back to their lying, racist house \n\nI'm so sorry you are dealing with this BS!", "NTA\n\nThe friend's mom is toxic.", " NTA.

Just ignore these idiots.", "I don't know what is more pathetic an adult woman having a panic attack over a headscarf or an adult man feeling threatened by it.

NTA", "NTA.\n\nAs ridiculous as I find such religious rules, everyone should be free to exercise them as long as it does not impact others.

You are being treated poorly, have no reason to honor such a ridiculous request and absolutely should not do so.

People don\u2019t have to \u201cget over\u201d the pain and loss that was caused.  But they do need to get over this idea that the entirety of Muslims are responsible/want to see us harmed.", "I also agree that she should wear what she wants, but the comparison with a kippah is invalid.  Kippah isn't meant to broadcast that one gender must remain modest in front of the other one.  It's also not  required to wear a kippah in any country, even Israel, limiting a person's right to express themselves and coming with jail-time or even murder by the state for not wearing it.  The anti-female violence we're seeing in iran this month, is actually all because of the headscarf, and males trying to keep women on their knees.\n\nAgain, if she wants to wear it, she should be able, but let's not resort to calling her family out on \"bullshit islamophobia\" - it is actually her mother's right to decide if she wants her daughter exposed to the principles behind women feeling the need to wear headscarves.  So, maybe the girl will find she can go to some houses, but not to others- it's her choice.\n\nEven if you're Jewish, you should know that what you said was dead wrong, and could be taken as an anti-jewish slander.  Haven't you seen on the news, the massive spike in hate-crimes again jews in Western countries this year?  If you are Jewish, you seriously need re-education as to why the Torah commands men to walk no more than 6 paces without their heads covered.  The headscarf comparison is actually mind-boggling.", "I\u2019m also Jewish and yeah people can suck.

Islam is not a race. NTA op, they can not dictage what you wear?", "I don't adhere to kosher (is that how you phrase it?) but it still seems like a dick move to not include at least one cheese pizza. Maybe I'm biased, but I don't like pepperoni so it's nice to have other options.", "a headscarf is not religion, it's an article of clothing. report her!", "Lol, she's telling on herself for being discriminatory.
