I\u2019m studying for my finals for my senior year of HS and I was is a study group, and had to go to someone else\u2019s house to study. I\u2019ll call her Rachel.\n\nI arrive at Rachel\u2019s house, and, keep in mind, I was one of four girls coming over. At the door, Rachel\u2019s mom encourages me to remove my scarf, and Rachel follows suit. Her mom said that it made her nervous. I told her it was not coming off, especially since there was a man in the house. Rachel swore up and down that there wasn\u2019t, but sure enough, when I got in there, her (older) boyfriend was there. One of the other girls in the group called this out, but her mom claimed to not know he was there (which I don\u2019t understand, but, whatever I guess). \n\nEverything went pretty smoothly after that, until Rachel just texted me, claiming that her mom was having a panic attack due to my scarf and it made her boyfriend feel threatened. She told me it was her house so her rules, that I was an AH, and that I would not be welcomed back. One of the other girls is taking it next time, I know her family and they\u2019re great, but Rachel says she will not be in attendance because her mom doesn\u2019t want her near me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the support, I appreciate it! I also just now realized that I was unclear- the boyfriend isn\u2019t Rachel\u2019s boyfriend, it is her mom\u2019s.

If the woman has so many issues that a teenage girl wearing a hijab can't be in her house, just, wow. The much greater likelihood is that she's just being racist. Please have an absolute meltdown if anyone named Chris,  Christine, Christopher, Christina, or any variation of those comes in your house and wail about how a cross/crucifix/saint's icon on a necklace makes you feel unsafe.

In effect, it\u2019s a way to almost \u201credline\u201d Muslims by using the state facilities against them to dole out lesser services, and over simply food.\n\nBeyond this, there is also the principle that this is a veiled attempt to challenge the feasibility of Islam within Denmark by making the consumption of pork synonymous with \u201cactually\u201d belonging when there is no reason relating to practical forms of integration (ex: learning the Danish language, knowing Danish history and culture, interacting with Danish social and professional groups) that eating pork delivers on; all it does is politicise choices of food and making that synonymous to you as a \u2018failure\u2019 in integrating to Danish values if you won\u2019t have some stegt fl\u00e6sk or frikadeller.\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid hill to die on, but it\u2019s a hill that results arbitrarily in less funds for services in areas with noticeable minority populations, and it\u2019s entirely to sabotage certain people\u2019s ability to actually integrate when you make something as irrelevant as pork consumption the dividing line between \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cfailure\u201d.", "Yes, that's about requiring that pork be available in Danish daycares, it doesn't require people to eat it\nNot serving pork to the non-Muslim kids because the Muslims don't want to be around it, as a few daycares were doing, does seem to go too far in the other direction", "I would be in favour of la\u00efcit\u00e9 if it did actually start from a neutral point, but here in Europe, it\u2019s just asking for a lot to be consistent with that because we just don\u2019t have that.

As much as one can make the argument that banning them is seen as a victory to those who are repressed, it is a failure of systems that should be allowing women to choose the trajectory of their lives.

Hijabs are just focused on like this, but somehow aren\u2019t able to be extrapolated through confronting it with social work, because they\u2019re so alien and really trigger the xenophobia here.

I was friends with twins at my university, one of the girls chose to wear a hijab while her sister didn't. The one who did said she felt more comfortable with it on.", "I said if OP wants to wear it, that she should, and the woman having a panic attack is quite possibly crazy. \n\nBut to reply; it is an obligation in Islam. Women covering up is an expectation. \n\nI have tried to make sense of this  rationale, to see it as cultural differences. But I can\u2019t reasonably see it as anything other than be at odds with equality and freedom of choice. Because where is the freedom of choice if your religious society/family/community EXPECTS it? \n\nSeeing religious culture from an atheists perspective is difficult to square with modern views on equality. Many religious restrictions on freedoms, once you strip away the religious argument, can and does appear regressive.", "Some of us are scared of nuns. Though I don't expect them to disprove because they make me nervous.", "\\*Why's your throat closing off? That's an odd color that you're turning. Everyone knows peanut allergies are fake. How come you're on the floor?\\*", "Common with catholics. Whether it\u2019s overt (necklace over clothes) or not (kept under) varies a lot more, and usually it\u2019s a small cross (an inch or less) on a thin chain,\n\nIn europe it\u2019s also frequent for the cross to be replaced by a pendant with the big J, Mary, or a saint (usually your namesake saint).", "Does that law target Sikh and Jews too? Since the men wear something on their heads. Just curious.\n\nI thought France was the only country banning head covering. Such an odd thing to ban. What about when women wear a scarf for fashion?", "Me too with the Reynaud's - I'm not overall extra sensitive to the cold - in fact, my core temp rises very quickly after beginning even mild exercise - but I get the very pale numb fingertips at the drop of a hat. I'd have to practically stick my fingers in the car's a/c vent on the way home from practice on cold February nights.\n\nEmbarrassingly, I hadn't thought about putting on warmer gloves or anything. Since \\*I\\* didn't feel particularly cold when my fingertips suddenly went numb, I guess I assumed it wasn't particularly causally connected to \\*them\\* being cold. Silly of me!", "Doubt it. Christian religion probably doesn\u2019t have the same effect on islamophobes", "Seriously? I went to Catholic schools up until middle school and I never knew about this.", "I was raised catholic, in Europe, and I don't personally know anyone who wears one or who has when I was younger and still active in activities in our parish. But maybe in the south of Europe or Poland I could imagine it.", ">I am aggravated when girls and women are brought up and bullied in environments by the men in their life with wearing their hijab\n\nThey are talking about burqas being banned, not hijabs, that's a huge huge difference, and it has been pushed through law partly to stop girls and women to be brought up and bullied in environments by the men in their life with wearing burqas.", "I agree. Someone who has PTSD, with panic attacks and/or dissociation attacks already has to work a lot on themselves to not 'run into a trigger' as I say it. \n\nWhat these people has was a prejudiced fear about something they do not know about and only have prejudiced feelings on it from.... hearing of. \n\nThe first time I had a panic attack in public it was horrible. Someone did notice me swaying and grabbed me before I hit the ground. They helped me sit up but all I could do was shake and trying to get air. \nThe lady who was keeping me upright said her teeth had been clattering of how hard I had been shaking (As a joke to help me smile)\nI fear having them in public and I worked so hard on them. \n\nAnd tbh, people who just have some fear feelings talking about \"I had a panic attack.\" I always, always have to hold myself in to say.... you don't know what a panic attack is. If you did, you wouldn't just be randomly calling it out. \n\nLuckily lately I have good control. The dissociation are without a warning though....", "Well, apparently some people don't know the difference between \"I've been made slightly uncomfortable\"  and \"I am having a panic attack\".", "I do know people who enjoyed Catholic school, but they're both male.", "This comment was talking about the general premise of laws around banning coverings overall, hijab being an example of the apparent \u201cleast offensive\u201d common denominator. I disagree on it being a \u201chuge, huge difference\u201d because this has been the gateway to bans of hijab under the same reasonings. And as it comes to pass, [patterns are repeating themselves here; we\u2019re planning on banning hijabs here too, starting with the primary schools](https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/news/denmark-proposition-ban-hijab-primary-schools_en). So at the end of the day, the difference doesn\u2019t matter when we are sliding into banning them all.\n\nAs of your explanation as to why it\u2019s righteous to ban them, I fail to see why the extension of social work and mental health services can\u2019t attack alleged coercion in the same way with hijabs if being forced that other forms of coercion, such as corporal punishment and sexual abuse, are dealt with through such services. It\u2019s rather easy to tell when a woman wants to wear a covering or not when access to mental health and social work are made, well, accessible.", "Agreed on the statues. It was one of my favorite things in Bali, seeing the gorgeous stonework. I was very tempted to buy some to ship home to the US. \n\nNTA. Having a panic attack over someone wearing a hijab? She should get over herself. Lying about a man in the house was pretty nasty, too.", "Just because you claim it isn\u2019t one or the other doesn\u2019t make it true. For every school that doesn\u2019t serve pork because of a sky fairy that is one less choice for everyone else. Schools providing choices for everyone doesn\u2019t force Muslims to eat pork.", "Teacher here. Please report this to your school and the teachers of any class you have with Rachel. I\u2019m sorry to hear about what happened and reporting it is important. Speak your truth. Solidarity.", "Rachel and her mom (and mom's partner) are racist.\n\nNTA.", "It's not an obligation, it's a choice", "Not so nice at all.  In fact the law starts with Not withstanding the constitution\u2026."]}
