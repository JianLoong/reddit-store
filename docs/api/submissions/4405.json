I\u2019ll call her Rachel.\n\nI arrive at Rachel\u2019s house, and, keep in mind, I was one of four girls coming over. At the door, Rachel\u2019s mom encourages me to remove my scarf, and Rachel follows suit. Her mom said that it made her nervous. I told her it was not coming off, especially since there was a man in the house. Rachel swore up and down that there wasn\u2019t, but sure enough, when I got in there, her (older) boyfriend was there. One of the other girls in the group called this out, but her mom claimed to not know he was there (which I don\u2019t understand, but, whatever I guess). \n\nEverything went pretty smoothly after that, until Rachel just texted me, claiming that her mom was having a panic attack due to my scarf and it made her boyfriend feel threatened. She told me it was her house so her rules, that I was an AH, and that I would not be welcomed back. One of the other girls is taking it next time, I know her family and they\u2019re great, but Rachel says she will not be in attendance because her mom doesn\u2019t want her near me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the support, I appreciate it! I also just now realized that I was unclear- the boyfriend isn\u2019t Rachel\u2019s boyfriend, it is her mom\u2019s.

You have the right to choose what you wear and to not be pressured to remove your hijab, especially in the presence of a man who is not a family member. It is not fair or respectful for Rachel's mom to ask you to remove your hijab, and it is not appropriate for her to have a panic attack over your choice of clothing. You have not done anything wrong by refusing to remove your hijab, and it is not your responsibility to make Rachel's mom or boyfriend feel comfortable.

If the woman has so many issues that a teenage girl wearing a hijab can't be in her house, just, wow. The much greater likelihood is that she's just being racist. Please have an absolute meltdown if anyone named Chris,  Christine, Christopher, Christina, or any variation of those comes in your house and wail about how a cross/crucifix/saint's icon on a necklace makes you feel unsafe.

Kippah isn't meant to broadcast that one gender must remain modest in front of the other one.  It's also not  required to wear a kippah in any country, even Israel, limiting a person's right to express themselves and coming with jail-time or even murder by the state for not wearing it.  The anti-female violence we're seeing in iran this month, is actually all because of the headscarf, and males trying to keep women on their knees.\n\nAgain, if she wants to wear it, she should be able, but let's not resort to calling her family out on \"bullshit islamophobia\" - it is actually her mother's right to decide if she wants her daughter exposed to the principles behind women feeling the need to wear headscarves.  So, maybe the girl will find she can go to some houses, but not to others- it's her choice.\n\nEven if you're Jewish, you should know that what you said was dead wrong, and could be taken as an anti-jewish slander.  Haven't you seen on the news, the massive spike in hate-crimes again jews in Western countries this year?
