{"id": 10092, "submission_id": "113kk9t", "title": "AITA for giving my husband free reign to plan our vacation after he complained about how I was doing it?", "selftext": "Long story short. I met my husband Rick backpacking in Europe.  It took us a few years to get together but we eventually got married. Did some great vacations around the world. Got reasonable jobs for this economy.  We do well as DINKs.  He is a bit older than I am.  We decide to start a family. COVID screws out plans.  COVID lockdowns and be stuff are over. Yay.  He suggests we go on a last adventure vacation before we have a kid. Okay let's do this.  \n\nAnd now the story begins.  I'm planning a trip for us to Central America.  I have a decent budget for our trip.  I figure nice hotel. Some planned excursions some days wandering around doing whatever we want.  One spa day with a couples massage and a fish pedicure.  \n\nRick looks at what I'm planning and says that we are becoming really bougie.  That in the old days we would stay in hostels and party all night then trek through the jungle to have lunch in a village that other tourists didn't see because they were too scared to go off the beaten path.  \n\nI asked him if he wanted to plan the vacation. He said yes. I'm pretty laid back and up for anything so I let him go to town.  \n\nWe just got back and he's going to the massage place at the physiotherapist.  Because we stayed at a guy's house near the beach.  Just some random guy he found online.  The mattress was foam.  Not memory foam. Just foam. No AC. Just got and humid. I could go on but you get the idea.  \n\nRick twisted his back dancing drunk off his ass three days before out flight home.  I told him we should go into the city find a good hotel and get him into a hot tub and a massage table. Nope. He insists on staying at that house.  Our ride into the city is bad. The airport and flight were bad.  He is a hurting unit. \n\nNow his mom calls me to say that I'm a bad wife for letting him do stupid shit.  Lady he is an adult.  I had an excellent vacation planned.  I can't help it if he thinks he is still 26. I told her to stay in her lane. If she wants to complain she can call her son. He planned everything.  Now he is mad that I told his mom on him.  Now I am reconsidering having a baby with this baby.  Just kidding I still love him. \n\nSo in conclusion I did the old fashioned thing and let my big strong husband be manly and plan our vacation.  Now he is all bent over and hobbling around and he called his mom to tell on me for not taking control when he went off the rails?  I guess? That is the shit show I'm dealing with.  I'll be honest though. I had a blast.  But I'm not in my mid thirties.", "created_utc": 1676531191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113kk9t/aita_for_giving_my_husband_free_reign_to_plan_our/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of a vacation with a mix of partying, adventure, and pampering my husband chose balls out craziness like we did twelve years ago.  I might be the asshole because I know we aren't in the shape we were twelve years ago and I didn't find a way to communicate that to him effectively so he could make better choices.  I do honestly feel.a little a little responsibility for the shape he is in right now.  I probably should have convinced him to consider the resort for a base.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He can make his own decisions. If he wants to pay budget for everything, get drunk and throw out his back, and sleep on a bad bed despite that, then that\u2019s his prerogative. He doesn\u2019t get to blame you for his own choices, especially since you were willing to change plans and find a more comfortable sleeping place. He especially doesn\u2019t get to have his mother yell at you for letting him make his own decisions, and then get mad at you when you let her know the backstory.

Good on you for calling out the Mom and setting the record straight.", "NTA I feel like he deserves this lesson about getting older!", "NTA obviously but will he truly be a team when you are parenting together?\n\nMy husband and I hit the wall with camping pads and upgraded to inflatable mattresses and this time around we are tempted to leave the tent home altogether and find some fancy yurts. Our bodies can\u2019t handle what they used to. Facts.", "NTA. You sound awesome.  I remember the first time I stayed at a resort instead of roughing it with the party people.  It's a whole different thing. And you can still go out and party. You just have a better place to recover from the rough nights.  And I remember those foam mattresses in Central and South America.  They must be some sort of joke on tourists because there is no way people sleep on those all their lives and don't develop bone problems.", "NTA - This is hilarious. He planned it all and you even gave him an out to go stay in a resort, get a massage, etc for the last few days after he injured himself. But he was adamant on staying and sleeping on the foam mattress.  He bought this on himself then chose to torture himself further.", "Talk to him about going to his mom to complain about you letting him do what he wants. Are you supposed to be parenting two children soon? This will not go away on his own. He needs to take responsiblity. \n\n\n\nNTA", "NTA average not like the other tourists mindset", "NTA.\n\nThis last advanture showed him that it should be the last advanture of this kind.\n\nHe wanted to know and now he knows.\n\nI wouldn't have handled the mom differently.", "You should be reconsidering having a baby if this is how he behaves. You need a responsible partner, not an overgrown teenager. Not only did he take over planning the vacation and make irresponsible choices, he tattled on you to his mommy\u2026and then got mad at you when you set the record straight. You two need to have some serious talks before having children. NTA.", "NTA, you did the right thing !\n\nI know you were joking by saying that you are reconsidering having a baby with him. But still. If he is unreasonable and then go cry to mama once he\u2019s done wrong, you definitely should think twice about having babies with him.", "He ran to his mommy because you let him do what he wanted? \n\nPlease don\u2019t have a baby with him \n\nNTA", "NTA but you're sure married to one. If he doesn't stop acting like a child yourself, you may *need* to reconsider having a child with him. You'll need somebody capable of being responsible when necessary (though playing together is always still great when circumstances permit).", "Hahahahaha\n\nI love this. \n\nYes direct his Mummy back to the planner!", "Did anyone get mid-life crisis vibes from hubby? \n\nNta girl. Go do something fun for yourself instead of listening to him whinge. He isn't 21 anymore.", "NTA. You sound grounded to me.\n\nAnd letting him plan is a totally reasonable call. Personally, I would tell you the thing or two that I really want to do (like a few scuba dives or a remote ancient ruin) and then let you whip up whatever else you see fit.\n\nHe\u2019s a bit of a ninny for telling his parents anything such that causes his mom to call you and begin mothering you. Like, lady, he didn\u2019t know how to man up and let someone do something better than he evidently can\u2026 and he didn\u2019t develop that inability because of me.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Rock on.", "This made me laugh. \n\nI \\*loved\\* my dirtbag travel years. I had wonderful adventures, amazing times, and sure yes some of those things wouldn't have happened if I'd been splashing lots of cash. \n\nBut at least I REMEMBER how goddamn uncomfortable it was as well. I do not have rose coloured glasses about that part! Nor about how moody my lower back is these days!\n\nNo way would I try to recreate my 20s adventures by slumming it again just on principle. I feel it can even get a little pretentious to insist on. I get it, Rick's wild youth is starting to feel like it has disappeared and he wanted to bring it back. But travelling with adventure and curiousity to see beyond the glossy travel-brochure stuff is an attitude and an approach. It doesn't go away because you sleep in a comfortable bed!\n\nAnyway, Rick has reaped what he sowed. It's absolutely bizarre that the mother of a man in his mid thirties is calling to complain that his wife 'let him' hurt his back on a trip, much worse that he would call her to dob on you for .... respecting his choices? Treating him like a grown up? Not being controlling? That really does *not* bode well.", ">So in conclusion I did the old fashioned thing and let my big strong husband be manly and plan our vacation. \n\nNTA just for this sentence that made me laugh.\n\nSeriously though. If a man wants to think he is younger than he is, let him. If you had tried to stop him with your \"bougie\" plans he would still be upset with you. And his mama has no business talking to you about her son's foolish choices. NTA", "NTA Sometimes they just have to fall flat on their face.\n\nI'm sorry your husband didn't figure his ish out sooner, but maybe he was trying to capture the \"feeling\" of being young and what not. This, hopefully, will be the reality check he needs.", "NTA. Your husband has learned a valuable lesson about human aging.", "NTA\n\nOh dear. At least you have practise todler so you'll know what to expect...\n\nSeriously though it's time to sit down and have really good talk about adulting. My biggest issue would be the whole ordeal getting his mother involved. I mean the trip etc - hopefully he learnt his lesson, but dragging others into this. Big fat no.", "NTA- \u201cconsidering having a baby with this baby\u201d I cannot stop laughing at this!!!!!! Lol when he starts to complain about how much it hurts. Call his mom and let her listen to it. I love my MIL, but would call her in a heart beat lol.", "NTA - I have a great deal of experience in this area. Men can plan travel, or women can plan travel, but there's only one natural travel planner in the couple. He learned it's not him. \nYou could use a travel agent next time and avoid some of the pitfalls. He could choose the restaurants/food plan if you plan everything else.", "NTA - You're his wife not his babysitter. He refused your original planned holiday, hurt himself while on his own badly planned holiday, and refused again when you suggested going to a hotel so he could recover. In short, he fucked around and found out.", "NTA as long as you leave him. Or at least never have a kid with him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
