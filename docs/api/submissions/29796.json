Your \"friend\" is being awful, I agree... but bringing in the boyfriend to pay on her behalf seems like unnecessary shaming. \n\nI think you might want to write off this $65 as a loss, and while you are at it, write off this \"friend\" as a loss as well.", "in my opinion no you are not the asshole for trying to get your money but its kinda selfish to harass her boy friend that didnt even know that she owed you any money. but your friend is being an asshole here i would just not let her go to girls night out untilll she pays you back if you can control that.

Other than that no you are not TA. For right now I would write the money off, because give her time and she will contact you wanting to go out for another girls night. When she does accept her offer. When you girls go out have fun eat a lot and have some drinks. When the server brings you the bill tell your \"friend\" that you didn't bring any money with you and she will have to pay this time. If she gives you a hard time tell her too bad she could always do the dishes if she doesn't have the money because you paid the last time. And before you walk out the door of wherever you're at, tell her don't ever contact you again because you are removing a toxic person from your life, and yes she is a very toxic person. Don't feel bad about removing her from your life, because all she is is a drama queen and you don't need that in your life. Then write her off, block her on all social media and send her emails to spam because you are much better off without her in your life sunshine xoxo", "Personally, I would start contacting her family members.
