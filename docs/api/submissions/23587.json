That he texts you about trivial things while he knows full well you are otherwise socially engaged is a problem. No, it's not the same as someone texting about the  logistics of something coming up shortly. He texted you several times about the book he was reading? And got \"frustrated\" that you didn't take time away from your social interaction to respond? At his age, it suggests some serious issues about needing your constant attention and reassurance. Maybe don't invest more fully in this relationship -- it's unlikely to lighten up from here.", "NTA. Honestly, that would be a red flag for me. He was mad because, knowing you were out with a friend, you didn\u2019t reply to texts about a book he was reading? That sounds exhausting.", "NTA so what if you did put him on silent?

What you did is what most people should do, put the phone away and talk without interruptions..\n\nAlso your scenario when you texted your friend was YOU making the text about meeting not necessarily checking your texts.

I'd walk away from that.", "NTA\n\nTake a good, hard look at what your BF did. He declined to join you for dinner, then texted you multiple times *about a book*. The book was just a pretext.

My ex started with similar bullshit. Getting upset that I didn't respond soon enough, pointing out \"inconsistencies\" in how I acted, told me he liked it when I dressed up and put on makeup (perennial tomboy over here), commented on unshaved legs, etc. \n\nBefore long, he started acting entitled to my body in a way that felt degrading but he would brush off any concerns. He would enthusiastically grope me while I was doing mundane things like washing dishes, and would say \"but I like it\" and would not stop after I said I didn't like it. When my protests became angrier and more direct (\"I don't want you to grab me like this\" or \"I'm being serious when I say that I don't want to be groped randomly\"), he tried to deflect with a \"joke\" that my body was his (\"no, they're MY boobs!\" ugh it makes me want to puke). Only a hot curling iron pointing at his face got him to back off.\n\nAnother shitty installment in humoring this kind of man: during the last year of pur relationship, I was avoiding sex as much as I could and started celebrating my period because too messy, oh well! He asked for a common form of oral sex instead. I don't enjoy doing it but did. He said \"time for a bj!\" for the next four months, every time I mentioned onsetting period symptoms. By the last month, I was honest that I hated it, felt disgusting doing it, that it hurt my jaw and made me break out, that it took a long time (20-30 minutes, sometimes longer), and that I didn't want to do it anymore. \n\nHis reponse? \"I wish the fact that I liked it was enough for you.\"\n\nHe wanted me to keep suffocating on my own saliva and snot for his own enjoyment and did not care one bit about my care or comfort. You deserve more than this, and he won't be the one to give you that.
