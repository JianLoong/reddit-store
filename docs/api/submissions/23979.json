Wife here. I\u2019d like to clarify a few points\u2026 I made my return at Target. I hung out with my best friend AT Target. I had been at Target for 26 minutes when I received the call because I stopped for gas beforehand (not something I give updates on as it\u2019s a small errand). I was at Target the entire time until we went to lunch (after I confirmed that my husband had already eaten lunch on his own). I recognize my lack of full communication and the entire thing feels 100% out of hand as my husband would like me to admit I am a liar. If anything, I did not communicate clearly and I had zero intent of harm or malice. We were returning school clothes that did not fit, replacing them and then buying breakfast/lunch items for school.

That does make it seem like you blew things WAY out of proportion then.", "INFO: \nAre you upset because you are incapable of taking care of yourself for that long, like a toddler, or is it because you\u2019re a manipulative and controlling dick who needs his wife to detail/justify every minute of her day to you? \n\nAre you disabled or injured in some way? Sick? \n\nAre you mentally incompetent to be alone? \n\nWere either you or your wife or children in any at endangered by her absence?\n\nWas there a shooting/natural disaster/traffic accident in the area you thought she was and you were worried for her life?", "YT- \n\nHoly duck why is your wife not divorcing you I don\u2019t understand", "You couldn\u2019t use common sense to piece that together? Oh\u2026.wait. Obviously not.", "I guess we will have to stop talking about this because here come the downvotes. People here aren't understanding that you and I are not bashing your wife for seeing her friend, not at all. \n\nI guess these other people just go out without telling their SOs/spouses anything at all and are comfortable with that. I don't know. I have been with my wife for 22 years. We tell each other where we are going because we trust one another, aren't jealous at all, and want to be able to come to each other's rescue if there is ever a problem. I don't need to know every detail every hour what she is doing. \n\nIt's not insane to want to know, in general, where they are. It's just a quick \"Hey I'm goin to my sisters.\" Or \"hey I'm going to the movies with my brother. \" Type shit. No one is blowing up anyone's phones and wants exact details. \n\nIf your spouse goes somewhere that is a 45 min tops trip, and they don't show up or contact you for 5 hrs, you're not at all worried that maybe something bad happened? That's the first thing I go to because at the very least, my girl would've texted me, \"hey I decided to go hang with so and so. I'll be home later.\" And my reply would be, \"Great. Have fun!\" Simple. Safe. Respectful. It's always best to be cautious, and one simple text does just that.\n\nNone of this is directed at you OP so I apologize if it sounds like it. I just find it odd that people are cool with just being gone for 5hrs with no response from their SOs. It's mind-boggling. My wife and I started dating before cellphones existed. We would literally send an AIM chat message or make a quick landline phone call to let the other one know what we were up to even back then. So it must be a generational thing.", "lol", "I wasn't suspicious about what she was doing at all. I was mad about the fact she made plans to go hang out with somebody for the day, but left that part out when she told me she was going to return something at the store.", "I take it you didn\u2019t read his wife\u2019s comment. She first stopped for gas and was at Target for 26 minutes before he called her. She was with her friend *at Target,* where she made the return of clothes that didn\u2019t fit their kids, then bought new clothes *at Target* as well as purchasing breakfast and lunch items for their kids *at Target.* \n\nShe checked to verify OP had eaten lunch then got lunch with her friend. I\u2019m glad you and OP are able to get gas, do a return, replace the items you returned, shop and purchase a week\u2019s worth of groceries, then eat at superhuman speeds, but not everyone is like you. \n\nTo recap, she wasn\u2019t chilling at her friend\u2019s place, ignoring OP. She was running errands for their family and her friend was with her at the store then she spoke with OP within less than half an hour after her arrival there. \n\nShe\u2019s doing alllll this while he\u2019s doing what? Oh, right. Playing games. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t have been gone for so long if she didn\u2019t have to do all of it herself. And considering OP\u2019s propensity to concoct a scenario wherein he\u2019s the victim, I truly doubt she was actually gone for 5 hours. \n\nYTA, OP. Even before I saw your wife\u2019s comment you came across as controlling, but that confirmed it. I hope she gives you updates on the minutia of her day from here on out. You\u2019d certainly deserve it for coming on here looking for sympathy.", "So had she stayed home would you have been doing family time, or would you have been playing Fortnite all day?", "I understand. But why? Why does it matter. I understand for the sake of safety, you want to know your spouse is ok. So you called and made sure she was ok. \n\nI think the real issue here is that her not telling you the whole story makes you uncomfortable. I assume your gut is telling you something is wrong. But based on everything you\u2019ve clarified, you have no reason to be suspect about something bad happening. \n\nDid you feel left out? There has to be something below the surface to make this make sense.", "I don't like being lied to (not that anybody does).  IMO- there was nothing to lie about, so why do it?"]}
