Wife here. I\u2019d like to clarify a few points\u2026 I made my return at Target. I hung out with my best friend AT Target. I had been at Target for 26 minutes when I received the call because I stopped for gas beforehand (not something I give updates on as it\u2019s a small errand). I was at Target the entire time until we went to lunch (after I confirmed that my husband had already eaten lunch on his own). I recognize my lack of full communication and the entire thing feels 100% out of hand as my husband would like me to admit I am a liar. If anything, I did not communicate clearly and I had zero intent of harm or malice. We were returning school clothes that did not fit, replacing them and then buying breakfast/lunch items for school.

I'm not saying you have the right to veto her plans or anything, but a heads up would be nice. When a spouse goes on an errand, there's an expectation of how long that errand will take and if it takes longer, it can become a concern for safety. \n\nOverall, there just needs to be better communication.

Are you the type who would've said to her \"no you can't go see your friends?\" \n\nDo you ever forbid her to go places? If not, then there was no reason for her to not simply state, \"Hey I'm gonna go return something I bought, then I'm gonna go hang out with my friends.\" I presume your response would've been, \"Ok, hunny. Have fun!\" I'm not saying to be suspicious of her or anything.

Have fun!\" Simple. Safe. Respectful. It's always best to be cautious, and one simple text does just that.\n\nNone of this is directed at you OP so I apologize if it sounds like it. I just find it odd that people are cool with just being gone for 5hrs with no response from their SOs. It's mind-boggling. My wife and I started dating before cellphones existed.
