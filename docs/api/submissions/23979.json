Throwaway account here.\n\nToday, my wife came into my gaming room at our house and told me she was going to the store to make a return.  The store is only about 10 minutes from our house.

Her position is that she didn't lie to me because regardless of whether or not she told me that she was  going to hang out with her friend, she still went to the store to return the item that she was planning to return.  My position is that she lied because she (admittedly-) had already made plans to hang out with her friend but completely left that out when she told me she was going to the store to return the item.\n\nWe just had a big argument about the situation, with my wife saying she didn't realize she needed to tell me every single detail about everything she was going to do for the day.

Wife here. I\u2019d like to clarify a few points\u2026 I made my return at Target. I hung out with my best friend AT Target. I had been at Target for 26 minutes when I received the call because I stopped for gas beforehand (not something I give updates on as it\u2019s a small errand). I was at Target the entire time until we went to lunch (after I confirmed that my husband had already eaten lunch on his own). I recognize my lack of full communication and the entire thing feels 100% out of hand as my husband would like me to admit I am a liar. If anything, I did not communicate clearly and I had zero intent of harm or malice. We were returning school clothes that did not fit, replacing them and then buying breakfast/lunch items for school.

Would you seriously expect your wife to check in every 26 minutes??? \n\nI'm also part of a couple that keeps their partner in the loop, but if I said I was going to Target to do some shopping, I wouldn't expect to be called a liar if I wasn't home within 26 minutes, after going out to make some exchanges, do groceries and get lunch. Sometimes I meet a friend at the shops, sometimes I don't. It doesn't make me a liar if it takes a few hours to complete a few errands comfortably.  \n\nAnd it wasn't like OP was expecting his wife home at a specific time because they had other plans.

I\u2019ll edit my comment and add that in. \n\nMy point still stands here. 81% of homicide victims are men, yes, but put that into the perspective of perpetrator and you add another layer to this. This [study of US homicide perpetrators](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251886/murder-offenders-in-the-us-by-gender/) shows that men are around 10x more likely to be a murderer than a woman and 4x more likely to be a victim. \n\nAgain, this is about the bigger picture of gendered issues. Why do men murder more and engage in violent crime more than women? It\u2019s a societal issue that we all need to be aware of, hold accountable, and recognise in the small ways they appear like they do on this post (the controlling, angry husband). Men are clearly suffering, and so are women, so why belittle either issue by pointing the finger in the wrong places? \n\nAgain, apologies for my misinformation. I\u2019ll correct it. Thank you for opening the discussion further, too.", "This is oretty indicative of control issues.  I'd say that's probably what is wrong here. I've been with a man who everytime I did anything he'd make leaps and bounds to make me look like I was lying or cheating so he could justify constantly invading my privacy and when people would be ljke you're controlling he'd say oh, but she lies. \ud83d\ude44 I feel for OPs wife if this is the case. Seems so weird he wants her to say she's a liar so bad."]}
