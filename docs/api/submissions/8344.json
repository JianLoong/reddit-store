He and Dex's mom divorced when Dex was 2 and when Dex was 4 he met his current wife Shanna. When Dex was 6 his mom died. A couple of years later Shanna got pregnant and went into premature labor. My niece was stillborn and a hysterectomy had to be performed to save Shanna's life after serious complications. It broke her. She was lost and in her grief she attempted to cling extra hard to Dex and have him be the child she could no longer have biologically. But Dex was not Shanna's biggest fan and he did not want to just sit with her all the time and pretend she was his mom. My brother decided Shanna should adopt Dex. He was so hard on Dex for wanting to hang out with friends or for being in his room instead of around Shanna. She became more and more possessive of Dex. My husband and I noticed and we stepped in to try and help but my brother became angry and kicked us out and told us we were not helping Shanna. For several months Dex was cut off from the rest of the family and went through a lot at home. In the end he had a huge outburst in school and CPS became involved and from there Dex was removed from my brother and placed with my husband and I. It was supposed to be temporary but my brother failed repeatedly to change how he treated Dex. At that point he was treating his son like he was the worst person in the world. Dex told me his dad called him evil after everything that happened with Shanna. He told him he'd hate him forever for not helping her when he could easily.\n\nIt seems Shanna eventually did seek help. My brother decided this was enough to get Dex back but CPS and the judge disagreed. He then cornered me at Christmas and told me that he deserved to be back in his son's life and we were punishing him for parenting decisions that many others would make it his shoes (meaning trying to force his kid to become his wife's kid to gloss over the loss of her own child and her ability to have a child in the future). I told him he didn't deserve to be a father after the way he treated his own child. I told him Dex should have always been at the forefront of his mind, that he never should have verbally mistreated him for not faking things for Shanna. I said as a husband he should have gotten her some real, professional help and he should have supported his son in saying he didn't want Shanna to become his new mom, instead of calling him evil, instead of telling him he was disgusted with him or comparing him to a historical figure who was responsible for the deaths of so many people (this actually happened on multiple occasions). I told him he should be ashamed of himself and leave Dex to live a happier and healthier life without him. My brother was furious. He attempted to confront me again at work. A friend of his actually told me I should have been more understanding and even if I'm angry, it was too harsh to say he didn't deserve to be a father.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674753481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lx1sa/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_never_deserved_to/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Until then, do what\u2019s in the best interest of the child.", "While I understand your brother\u2019s panic to try and help his wife who has just had a miscarriage, forcing a very young child to be responsible for his step-mother\u2019s mental wellbeing is not the way to go about it. I\u2019m incredibly sorry for Shanna\u2019s loss and I\u2019m glad to hear that she\u2019s getting help, but it\u2019s clear that your brother needs help too. I do think that a gentler conversation should be pursued about him getting help, from you or from friends/relatives that he\u2019s comfortable with.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re not wrong to want to protect Dex from it all.

Even professionals and the court don't think he deserved to be a father. I would ignore his friend, I very much doubt they know the vile things your brother said to his own child.", "NTA-I\u2019m so sorry for Shanna\u2019s loss but that doesn\u2019t excuse the way your brother continually treated his son. I\u2019m glad he has you and your husband.", "NTA\nIt seems to me your brother needs more help than his wife. Ask him to go to therapist. Were your words not polite, yeah .Was it justified, definitely.", "NTA -- You could have been gentler and more compassionate. I imagine thats very hard after seeing your nephew go through that. And you yourself are human after all. I hope that everyone involved gets the help they need. I'm going to assume that Dex is getting help already since this went through CPS. \n\nYour brother needs to get help as well. I get he was trying to help his current wife, but the child didn't deserve any of the abuse. And that's what it is at the end of the day. A six year old isn't responsible for the well being of any adult in their household. Full stop. \n\nMuch love to all of you and I hope you get everything worked out. In the meantime, just love that kiddo.", "NTA. What you said was true. On the one hand, I feel like it could have been said a little more tactfully, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t have a lot of tolerance for people who are immature and don\u2019t put their kids first. I deal with that crap in my own family.", "NTA\n\n Wow. No offense, but your brother is a piece of work. I feel bad for his wife's loss, that must've been heartbreaking. But they way they treated Dex is unacceptable. He should've put his son's wellbeing first. Shanna needed help, professional help and it's understandable. But Dex wasn't there to cover her need to be a mother. He wasn't a son, and even if he was her son it still would be wrong to put all that on a small kid's shoulders. I'm glad that he has you and your husband.", "NTA.", "NTA - What you said was nothing more than the truth and thank heaven the courts/CPS aren't buying your brother's fake remorse and desire for parenthood.  Anyone who would treat a child like that literally does NOT deserve to be a parent.  That title comes with a lot of responsibilities, many of which your brother has thrown right out the window.  Please continue to protect Dex from this toxic nightmare of a sperm donor.  You are a real angel for all you do.", "NTA - your brother ended up abusing his child to the point CPS and a judge years later still don't wat to give back custody. That says enough about your brother. Good on you OP for keeping Dex safe.", "Oh nope. NTA. He doesn't deserve to be a dad. What an atrocious way to handle the entire situation on both of their parts.

He treated his son horrible & said some messed up things & now he wants his son back. The damage has been done & Dex will remember everything his dad said to him. NTA", "I wouldn't say YTA. You are clearly defensive of the child, who you obviously care about. But, you are being harsh and judgy and aren't showing compassion, understanding, or empathy for your brother. Most people don't seek professional help right away. They don't know they have a problem. They are coping the best they can. If he gets help and pulls himself together, his son benefits from having his father in his life. Your anger is taking over here.", "ESH. I know I will get down voted, but here's the thing. If you got temporary custody then you were a foster parent. Foster parents are trained and agree not to bad mouth the biological parents. You can say that actions are wrong, but not that parents are bad. It is in the best interest of the child to maintain as civil and understanding relationship as possible, you didn't do that. Do what is best for the child in all cases, keep your opinions about the biological parents to yourself.", "He's 12 now and he was aware of what was going on with them. His dad used it to shame and talk down to him repeatedly.", "That was what the courts ordered him to do when Dex was removed.

But that is no excuse to call your child evil, to shame them, yell at them, make them feel unsafe, and to compare them to a horrific person. He has made no effort to follow what the court wanted him to do. He doesn't even seem to regret or see anything wrong with the treatment he subjected his own child to.", "Where was her brother\u2019s compassion, understanding and empathy for his son? He was pretty mean and vile to a child.", "Ah yes, just let the child abuser back into the abused child\u2019s life because you might not understand why the abuser did the abusing.", "His brother abused his child. Full stop.", "Wow! Then you\u2019re definitely NTA. I can\u2019t believe how incredibly selfish and immature your brother is.", "NTA - the harder he pushes to violate the boundaries as has hard as you are forced to push back to help Dex.    You are protecting a child from HIS harsh language and suddenly he's clutching his pearls?", "NTA, your friend should butt out. It\u2019s pretty severe he FAILED CPS. Like they let everyone have kids", "Make sure you have as many records as possible for the courts/case worker. This is abuse towards you, your husband, and especially Dex.\n\n\nBest of luck and hugs for y'all", "NTA there is a LOT of trauma here, so I feel for everyone in this situation, but Dex's well being had to come first.  That your brother has never made any attempt to improve things or change is a giant red flag, and I think you were justified in what you said.  With all due respect to this friend, they haven't been there through every moment of this and don't know everything that happened, so they are welcome to keep their opinion to themself.", "NTA. Please talk to a lawyer about a possible restraining order. At the very least he could send your brother a cease and desist letter.

He almost managed to destroy Dex on the altar of his wife. It is bad what happened to her but in turn she became insanely possessive, grasping .. to the point that CPS got involved because brother participated in the crazy.\n\nAnd he STILL can't get it through his thick skull. Be careful, I think this guy is dangerous. You make sure you have security in place so he can't try a kidnapping.\n\nNTA. And stand your ground. And don't listen to his idiot friends. They don't know what in heck is going on anyway...and even if they do, this is a prime example about how people are more concerned about the poor parents than the child who is being destroyed by said parents. That is what infuriates me the most about this and similar situations.", "NTA - The truth hurts. Dex is not the child of his wife and he isnt a emotional support animal for her.", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry for Shanna that she suffered a stillbirth as that is horrible, but it does not excuse how she and your brother treated Dax.", "NTA I\u2019m glad your nephew has someone like you in his corner to advocate for him", "NTA.
