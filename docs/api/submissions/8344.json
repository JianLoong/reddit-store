He and Dex's mom divorced when Dex was 2 and when Dex was 4 he met his current wife Shanna. When Dex was 6 his mom died. A couple of years later Shanna got pregnant and went into premature labor. My niece was stillborn and a hysterectomy had to be performed to save Shanna's life after serious complications. It broke her. She was lost and in her grief she attempted to cling extra hard to Dex and have him be the child she could no longer have biologically. But Dex was not Shanna's biggest fan and he did not want to just sit with her all the time and pretend she was his mom. My brother decided Shanna should adopt Dex. He was so hard on Dex for wanting to hang out with friends or for being in his room instead of around Shanna. She became more and more possessive of Dex. My husband and I noticed and we stepped in to try and help but my brother became angry and kicked us out and told us we were not helping Shanna. For several months Dex was cut off from the rest of the family and went through a lot at home. In the end he had a huge outburst in school and CPS became involved and from there Dex was removed from my brother and placed with my husband and I. It was supposed to be temporary but my brother failed repeatedly to change how he treated Dex. At that point he was treating his son like he was the worst person in the world. Dex told me his dad called him evil after everything that happened with Shanna. He told him he'd hate him forever for not helping her when he could easily.\n\nIt seems Shanna eventually did seek help. My brother decided this was enough to get Dex back but CPS and the judge disagreed. He then cornered me at Christmas and told me that he deserved to be back in his son's life and we were punishing him for parenting decisions that many others would make it his shoes (meaning trying to force his kid to become his wife's kid to gloss over the loss of her own child and her ability to have a child in the future). I told him he didn't deserve to be a father after the way he treated his own child. I told him Dex should have always been at the forefront of his mind, that he never should have verbally mistreated him for not faking things for Shanna. I said as a husband he should have gotten her some real, professional help and he should have supported his son in saying he didn't want Shanna to become his new mom, instead of calling him evil, instead of telling him he was disgusted with him or comparing him to a historical figure who was responsible for the deaths of so many people (this actually happened on multiple occasions). I told him he should be ashamed of himself and leave Dex to live a happier and healthier life without him. My brother was furious. He attempted to confront me again at work. A friend of his actually told me I should have been more understanding and even if I'm angry, it was too harsh to say he didn't deserve to be a father.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674753481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lx1sa/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_never_deserved_to/", "score": 1056, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother needed the harsh truth because it is the truth and that's why he fired back", "NTA\n\nAfter the way he treated his son? Not a chance.  You are looking out for his son, he is not. And the court system agreed that he is not a good father.", "NTA. Sure yozr brother and his wife went through alot, cant imagine how bad it was, but forcing a child to ACT like the kid of stepmom, and calling him all kinds of unforgivable things when son didn't oblige, that was horrible. The kid is better off without THIS dad, it would just be a question of time when he goes off again calling his son all kinds of hurtful things bcs he did something wrong(in his eyes)", "Nta. You need to start creating a paper trail with the police for his harassment and erratic behavior. He seems to be struggling with mental illness and maybe needs help too", "Nta. Keep him til he is 18 or goes off to love his adult life choices", "NTA - I am so glad you were there for your nephew. The names his dad piled on him and the expectation that this CHILD should be responsible for curing his wife's depression and mental instability is horrendous. Words can hurt and they can hurt forever . . . following a person around for the rest of their lives. As a child I was verbally abused and even though I am in my 70s . .  those words come back to haunt me and hurt me as fresh as if they were said yesterday. \n\nThe nephew deserved love and support and his dad wasn't there for him and wants to blame you for not returning him to a house full of abuse.\n\nYou are doing a great job! Keep protecting your nephew.", "NTA and keep supporting your nephew and do all you can to make sure they don\u2019t get custody. He\u2019s willing to sacrifice and destroy his own son for the happiness of his new wife. Don\u2019t let him- soon your nephew will be old enough to decide where to live in the worst case scenario", "NTA. If your brother tries to show up to your workplace again to confront you, have them call security or the police.", "NTA.  Thank you for standing up for your nephew.", "NTA\n\nAny good parent should always put their kids' needs before their partners wants.  Shanna badly **wanted** Dex to be her surrogate kid.  Dex **needed** his dad to reinforce boundaries since he had no desire to be.  \n\nInstead, your brother basically was horrible to his son to appease Shanna.  \n\nThat's not the behavior of a good or even OK parent.", "I\u2019m surprised you have contact with your brother.", "ESH - Shanna finally got help, has your brother?  If he hasn't, he needs to.  If he has, he needs to go more or find a different therapist.  His behavior towards Dex isn't ok and he needs to do the work on himself to see that and fix it.  But, that doesn't make your behavior ok.  You know your brother has had a lot of trauma and has issues.  Piling on and being purposeful cruel and escalating the situation because you are angry is NOT OK!  Be the adult in the room.  If your brother's actions become inappropriate or dangerous, go to the judge.", "This is a very good point. Most people don't have a very good understanding of just how severe things need to be going badly before a child is removed from their parents and not allowed to reunify. Especially in this case where there does not (?) sound to have been any physical or sexual abuse nor any life-threatening neglect. The bar for what's considered emotional abuse is unbelievably high. Their mistreatment of him will have been severe to lead to this point, so OP seems pretty justified in saying he didn't deserve to be dad.", "Yeah friend was problem told some sob story about how the brother and the wife went through this horrible tragedy and horrible CPS stole his some for no reason", "No child benefits from their parent emotionally abusing them! The situation must have been really bad if CPS had to remove the kid. They don\u2019t just take kids from their parents for no reason!\n\nThe brother is a massive AH and doesn\u2019t deserve to be a father!\nWhile I do feel sorry for Shanna, you can\u2019t just force a relationship! It is absolutely disgusting the way that Dex has been treated and he shouldn\u2019t have to forgive his father when he has been treated so badly by a pathetic excuse of a man!\n\nOP\u2019s brother absolutely deserves to be judged for being a child abuser and anyone who thinks otherwise can\u2019t have their head screwed on the right way.", "There had to be some physical abuse.", "*scrolls back up*\n\nWait what? Damn dude, holy fuck", "Then it unlikely he will get his son back.", "It shows.", "It's good that Dex has great family members like you to support him.", "If Shanna was experiencing serious enough post partum depression she may have been trying to force Dex to act the part of a baby and be held and rocked which would get there.", "If I'm reading the post right: parents divorced when Dex was 2\nDad met Shanna when kid was 4 \nMom died when he was 6\nShanna had a stillbirth when Dex was around 8 or 9\nWithin a year OP and family was cut off from Dec because of their concern over Shanna and dad's actions. I'm assuming Dex has been with OP for at least a year or two.", "Yep.  But the dad must have been part of that or other abuse if he didn't get visitation I would think.", "It could happen. There are Facebook groups  [dedicated to privately re-homing adopted children](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/unwanted-adopted-children-traded-online-underground-network-flna8c11120107). Although it hasn\u2019t happened yet, OP should be on the lookout in case they need to report their brother.", "isnt getting upset over fake stories the entire point of this sub?", "NTA\n\nTMI: my mother told me, once, that she hated me and wished she'd aborted me. I was a little kid. I can remember that scene with crystal brutal clarity to this day. It cut so deep. NOTHING can heal a remark like that.  Nothing.  Even if my mom turned around and became mother of the year, it wouldn't have fixed anything.  I'm the product of someone who received that brutal comment and my opinion is, you didn't go hard ENOUGH on dad for telling him his own son is \\*evil\\*.", "Tell that friend to stfu", "NTA. What does he even expect you to do? Say to CPS I can't take care of my nephew anymore so guess he's got to go back to his dad even though professionals and judges agree he shouldn't have custody. Yeah that will totally work. Not like they would just find another person to house him, destroying his sense of safety and family. Sorry but your brother is a moron if he thinks you have any say in any of this.", "NTA. Facts are facts.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be a father when he can\u2019t treat the one he has as a real person. No child deserves this kind of treatment ever!", "Forced adoption is disgusting and in this case, obviously wasn't in the best interests of the child.  \n\nHe is not his stepmother's emotional support toy and hopefully he will never have to go back to that environment, since his very presence in her life could trigger her to inflict controlling behaviour patterns on him again.  His dad still doesn't get it, the kid shouldn't be an emotional punchbag for him either.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You spoke only the truth. Thank you for keeping Dex safe.", "The father is trash.. Pure and simple. NTA.", "NTA \nYou\u2019re honest responsible loving to Dex\nYour brothers cruelty and head trip on Dex  does make unworthy of fatherhood \nTake care of the kid and who cares what your brother thinks his stupid friend and their unsolicited opinion.", "Keep Dex as far away from your brother as possible.... NTA", "NTA. \nComparing the kid to Churchill is too much.", "NTA. Takes a fair bit for cpfs to take a kid from their home. He failed Dex. The judge and cpfs could see that. Sadly your brother couldn\u2019t.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are doing the right thing for that boy", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should not be more understanding,. you should get a restraining order.", "NTA.  Your brother is way out in AH territory.  He is literally demanding his young son be his wife's emotional support animal.  You have done a very good and necessary thing by taking Dex into your home.  I pray CPS and the judge continue to put Dex's needs first.", "NTA. You told him what he\u2019s already been told by the courts and CPS that he\u2019s a terrible father. Keep him away from your nephew, he deserves to be raised by people who care and love him instead of being abused his father and step-mother.", "\nWhy is it that you shouldn\u2019t be harsh with your adult brother but that adult father gets s pass for his horrible treatment of his child.  Where were those people when Dex was being abused?", "NTA but keep in mind your brother suffered a loss too with their stillborn child.  He obviously didn't handle it well,  nor did he handle his wife's depression well. He used your nephew to try and take away their grief and lashed out when that didn't work.  It's a good thing that you were there and willing to step in. With that being said,  I don't think it's fair to turn your back on your brother forever.  If he and his wife finally seek help,  maybe they can start to have a limited relationship with his son.", "NTA\n\ni do feel really bad for Shanna tho", "You are SO NTA, OP. I am so glad that Dex has you and your husband. They threshold to remove a child from a custodial parents' home by legal force is extremely high. (Lawyer in the US, not sure where you live) and reunification is typically always going to be the goal absent severe abuse of some kind. \n\nWhat your brother did to Dex is abuse and it sounds like he hasn't gotten any better.", "OP\u2019s only job is protecting Dex. Her brother is a child abuser who refuses to attend court ordered therapy and who is harassing OP at work. OP should be filing a restraining order if her brother refuses to seek help and back off.", "the brother isn\u2019t even seeking help, that\u2019s part of why he still hasn\u2019t gotten Dex back.", "My question then is how have rights not been terminated? Or has it not hit the limit? Has the adjudication happened yet?", "I realize that,  that's why I said IF they both seek help,  maybe then they can have some contact.  I think it's sad all around,  with a lot of trauma that everyone has suffered, mostly Dex, who should also be in counseling if he isn't already.  But I also feel like a better approach to dealing with the brother would be to acknowledge his pain as well,  calmly point out the terrible ways he's treated his son,  to tell him he needs to be accountable for his actions,  and he needs to seek help before having any type of relationship with his son.   I don't see how piling it on and telling him he should have never been a father helps anyone.....", "I think it does in any state in the US.", "maybe it\u2019s because i went through something similar but a lot of the times, people like the brother need to hear to the cold hard truth. also seems like the brother is emotionally, mentally and verbally abusive to Dex so no, i don\u2019t see the need for any contact until he gets better- actually no contact unless Dex wants contact seeing how Dex hates him. sure the brother is in pain but that\u2019s not an excuse for him to do what he\u2019s doing and to say what he\u2019s saying and for whatever he did for cps to take Dex away. he\u2019s been told by a judge AND cps to get therapy (aka seek help) but he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing wrong. he literally told Dex he\u2019s evil and said he\u2019ll hate him forever. i see no reason for brother to be in Dex\u2019s life ever again. even if he got help because i guarantee you that Dex will never forget this.", "Pretty sure you've defined AITA in one sentence.", "I mean.... venting my spleen on these posts is exactly why I created an account in the first place...(it's also why my account was suspended during my first week on here... I overspleened)\nNta for this one, the brother needs to take about 10 years of therapy on this issue, just enough time for Dex to graduate college and leave the state for good."]}
