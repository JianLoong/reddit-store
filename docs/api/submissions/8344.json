He and Dex's mom divorced when Dex was 2 and when Dex was 4 he met his current wife Shanna. When Dex was 6 his mom died. A couple of years later Shanna got pregnant and went into premature labor. My niece was stillborn and a hysterectomy had to be performed to save Shanna's life after serious complications. It broke her. She was lost and in her grief she attempted to cling extra hard to Dex and have him be the child she could no longer have biologically. But Dex was not Shanna's biggest fan and he did not want to just sit with her all the time and pretend she was his mom. My brother decided Shanna should adopt Dex. He was so hard on Dex for wanting to hang out with friends or for being in his room instead of around Shanna. She became more and more possessive of Dex. My husband and I noticed and we stepped in to try and help but my brother became angry and kicked us out and told us we were not helping Shanna. For several months Dex was cut off from the rest of the family and went through a lot at home. In the end he had a huge outburst in school and CPS became involved and from there Dex was removed from my brother and placed with my husband and I. It was supposed to be temporary but my brother failed repeatedly to change how he treated Dex. At that point he was treating his son like he was the worst person in the world. Dex told me his dad called him evil after everything that happened with Shanna. He told him he'd hate him forever for not helping her when he could easily.\n\nIt seems Shanna eventually did seek help. My brother decided this was enough to get Dex back but CPS and the judge disagreed. He then cornered me at Christmas and told me that he deserved to be back in his son's life and we were punishing him for parenting decisions that many others would make it his shoes (meaning trying to force his kid to become his wife's kid to gloss over the loss of her own child and her ability to have a child in the future). I told him he didn't deserve to be a father after the way he treated his own child. I told him Dex should have always been at the forefront of his mind, that he never should have verbally mistreated him for not faking things for Shanna. I said as a husband he should have gotten her some real, professional help and he should have supported his son in saying he didn't want Shanna to become his new mom, instead of calling him evil, instead of telling him he was disgusted with him or comparing him to a historical figure who was responsible for the deaths of so many people (this actually happened on multiple occasions). I told him he should be ashamed of himself and leave Dex to live a happier and healthier life without him. My brother was furious. He attempted to confront me again at work. A friend of his actually told me I should have been more understanding and even if I'm angry, it was too harsh to say he didn't deserve to be a father.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674753481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lx1sa/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_never_deserved_to/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
