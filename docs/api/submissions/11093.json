I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn\u2019t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. \n\nThe wedding day comes and my fianc\u00e9 and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.\n\nAt the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??\n\nAt one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I\u2019m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was \u201cruining her special day\u2019. I couldn\u2019t believe it! My fianc\u00e9 and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.\n\nEver since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister since and I don\u2019t plan on it until I get an apology. AITA?\n\nEDIT: People keep saying that I should not have brought this up at the wedding. But when should I have brought it up?? It seems WORSE to bring it up AFTER the fact doesn\u2019t it?\n\nEDIT #2: To be clear, I originally wasn\u2019t mad at my sister. I was upset at my cousin and slightly upset at my family for not saying anything when they saw the child (I didn\u2019t want a fight to happen, just for them to hold her accountable). However, I got upset at my sister when she got mad at me for bringing it up. I feel like I deserved to let my cousin know how I really felt and I wanted my sister\u2019s support since I followed the rules.", "created_utc": 1677542666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dr7mg/aita_for_pointing_out_hypocritical_rules_at_my/", "score": 2428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your poor sister already had to deal with one guest ignoring her wishes and probably decided to  just let it go and focus on enjoying her wedding day. I\u2019m guessing the last thing she wanted to deal with was confronting your rude cousin and kick out a 3 year old. \n\nThere weren\u2019t different rules for different people, your cousin just decided to ignore the rules and your sister decided to make the best of an annoying situation. \n\nInstead of being empathetic and following your sister\u2019s lead, you decided to make it about you and your feelings, and made a scene.

Even though you followed the rules you should\u2019ve let it go because your kid was already at home with a sitter and your cousin\u2019s kid was already at the wedding.

She likely didn\u2019t mention it because *she wanted to avoid making a scene*. It\u2019s her wedding, she doesn\u2019t want that rule violation to be what her guests remembered. She could address it with the cousin later to ensure people are more focused on the matter at hand- her marriage. But you decided to act like a crazy person and start calling people out and acting angry because she didn\u2019t say anything right then and there and you felt unreasonably upset about something that your sister had no control over. \n\nIt was a child free event. Someone broke the rules. As to not cause a scene, your sister allowed it likely with the intention of handling it privately and you decided you should try to confront both the cousin and your sister. Why? Because you regret respecting your sisters wishes about her own wedding being child free when your cousin didn\u2019t? Because obviously your sister didn\u2019t make an exception, as you acknowledged. So it seems like you are just angry that you respected your sisters wishes.

Others are more serious, like using your fork to pick your nose. \n\nA gracious host does not draw unnecessary attention to a guest's social mistake. If possible, she glosses it over. A gracious host does not want any of her guests to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. That's why your sister and mom were trying to get you to stop.

You made a scene because someone else brought a child, and instead of letting it go, you acted like a child yourself. You need to apologize. It wasn\u2019t your place to say anything to your cousin. Chances are, either your sister chose to let it go, or she allowed the child. If she allowed that child but not your son, maybe look at your sons behavior.

What did you want your sister to go roundhouse kick your cousin during the wedding?", "YTA - Your cousin did the wrong thing brought a non-invited kid to a kid free wedding but your sister decided to be gracious about it, there's nothing wrong with that.

Yeah, it sucks that the cousin brought her kid to a childfree wedding, but it was also clear that no one wanted to make a scene and ruin the wedding by fighting over it. \n\nAnd what did you do?

I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn\u2019t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. \n\nThe wedding day comes and my fianc\u00e9 and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.\n\nAt the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??\n\nAt one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I\u2019m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was \u201cruining her special day\u2019. I couldn\u2019t believe it! My fianc\u00e9 and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.\n\nEver since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister since and I don\u2019t plan on it until I get an apology.

I'm trying to look at you as a whole, imperfect person with wonderful traits and flaws. Girl... What is going on here? Why are you so mad? What's making you mad? That's worth figuring out. I really hope you'll take my comment to heart. As someone who had some serious anger issues to unpack, I'm glad I did. My issues were different (I was never allowed to be mad and ate shit for everyone else), but ultimately, if you don't process anger well, it's like you're taking poison and expecting the other person to hurt.\n\nThis was long and a bit rambley, but I hope it helps you.", "YTA because it\u2019s not your sisters fault.

So yes, your sister had the right to say no to your child, but on the other hand, she has set the tone for your relationship and I would reflect that back myself.", "ESH- it\u2019s possible your cousins didn\u2019t see that part of the invitation, (which makes her TA) in which case your sister chose not to make a fuss (TA, but what could she really do?), it\u2019s possible your sister made an exception for your cousin (in which case she\u2019s TA) it\u2019s possible it was just your kid your sister didn\u2019t want there (in which case sis is a major AH).\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said anything to the cousin, that could only go badly. But I know I would have really struggled not to say something and don\u2019t really blame you. \n\nReddit loves child-free weddings- it is what it is- but when the little person you love more than anyone else is excluded from a major family event like that it\u2019s going to hurt.", "I'm going against the grain here and saying NTA - how rude of your own sister..I think kid free weddings are rude anyway and entitled and makes me just think the couple are selfish. I've never been to a wedding where the KIDS annoyed me. It's always been a drunk uncle or a drunk groomsman coming on to me, or a terrible noisy band that have made a wedding awful. And this was even before I had kids myself. \n\nIn hindsight it probably would have been better to not say it in the middle of the wedding, but still, how could she stand there and just act like nothing was happening without any explanation. Why did the cousin have her kid there and not yours ?!! You can't have one rule for one and another rule for another, even whether child is difficult or not, or behavioural problems or anything like that, it's so ignorant  \n\nI'd be furious too OP, so yea NTA", "I'm struggling to agree with the majority saying YTA.\n\nI don't think anyone but your cousin is the AH here. \nI have a toddler, and I'd still opt for a child free wedding \ud83e\udd23 \n\nYou followed the rules, and noone should be an exception, so why is your cousin so special?\n\nSomeone should have said something to the cousin.. simple as \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you didn't ruin the day, the cousin did and you just spoke your fair mind, as would I.", "I wanna say NTA for the very simple reason that it is tough to accept injustice, and that it is a very common human reaction to feel pissed when you are the victim of that. I think the sister could have just told you why this kid was allowed here, even if it was because the parents of the kid ignored the rule, it would have been a decent enough explanation. But she didnt say anything, therefore making it seem like this child\u2019s presence was expected.", "YTA-waiting until AFTER the wedding is exactly what you should have done here. You made her day about you being butt hurt that you couldn't bring your kid to her wedding. You followed her rules, which was respectful. Your cousin didn't and you have no idea how your sister felt about it. She likely just wanted to look past it and enjoy her wedding day, but you couldn't let her have that could you?", "1. If that happened and the person was not asked to leave (which would definetely happen), I'm leaving also. \n2. You'd rather be with your child than attend a wedding he's not invited to. The one organising the wedding can have rules but you can politely decline if those rules do not suit you. (no child)\n3. Your sister does not owe you any comprehension (it's her night) but neither do you! \n4. Just leaving without causing all this trouble would have been the better option.", "ESH. And why would you even want to bring a kid to a wedding instead of having fun? I have a 3 and 5 year old and absolutely no way am I taking them to a wedding.", "NTA child free weddings are the worst! Either everyone follows the rules or not. I am sorry you had to make accommodations for your child when clearly you shouldn't have.", "NTA.  As your sister, even though it is her wedding, it is her job to care about your feelings and not pretend like everything was fine when it's not. It's also your job to care about her feelings, but we are all human and allowed to make our concerns known now and then.\n\nAs the bride, your sister is in control of her wedding - she is the leader here and good leaders choose words that acknowledges everyone's feelings and makes everyone comfortable. She could have easily diffused the tension by saying, \"oh yeah, we made an exception for \\[cousin\\] because XYZ - I'm sorry that your kid couldn't come and I really appreciate you putting in the extra effort to find a babysitter\" or \"oh yeah, it is a kid-free wedding, but you know what \\[cousin\\], it's fine if you didn't read the details and didn't realize it was kid-free -- you're here now and let's just enjoy it!\" Your family too could have admitted to the oddity instead of pretending like everything is ok.  \"I can see how it can be upsetting, but ultimately not much we can do now, we can't kick them out of the wedding. should we just enjoy it?\" \n\nMy guess is your family is very conflict averse, except when it comes to telling you what to do. The fact that you made a joke pointing out the kid rule violation made them uncomfortable, and instead of questioning why they are uncomfortable, they put that blame on you for 'ruining their peace.' \n\nI think you and your sister need to apologize to EACH OTHER. there are always too sides to every story, and it takes two to tango. no one is an AH here. people are just humans with emotions and needs.", "Yeah... this post is all \"me, me, me...\".  It was tiring to read. I can't imagine having to deal with someone like OP in real life, poor family. \n\nAlso, OP, there was absolutely no reason for you to cause a scene at your sisters wedding. Sure, you were annoyed, but that didn't matter at all, since it wasn't your wedding. Also I'm rolling my eyes at your edit so hard. Bringing it up after the wedding would've been much much better, then you wouldn't have caused a scene at your sisters wedding!!!!!", "Yep. Cousin didn\u2019t abide by the rules, but it\u2019s up to the bride and groom and no one else if they want to cause a scene because of it. The cousin is also an ah here for just bringing the kid and ignoring the rules but op followed her sister\u2019s wishes on her wedding day. That should be enough to make her content. If I were op, would I be annoyed, yes. Would I cause a scene at a wedding, no. The bride decided that she didn\u2019t want to call out the cousin on it, so that\u2019s what happens. Also, what did op expect? She was already there with the child? Aside from getting thrown out of the wedding, it\u2019s not like the 3 year old could go wait at the bar\u2026", "Or maybe the cousin had a valid reason to bring her child, and the bride had given her permission.\n\nOP's \"jokes\" were really passive-aggressive comments.", "Surprised to not see this further up. While OP acted wrongly, she\u2019s not the only one:\n\n-OP is a brat and acted passive aggressively in a moment of stress for the bride. Obvious AH.\n-Unless there are special circumstances (which would have likely been mentioned if there were) the cousin is a clear AH for bringing a child to a childfree wedding.\n-Someone should have acted more strongly if the rules were floated. While her reaction is awful, OP is entitled to feel unfairly treated, because she kind of has been. It\u2019s not an easy choice, but letting it slip makes the bride a bit of an AH.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a clear YTA as people are making it to be.", "The sister and mom seem conflict avoidant. They made a *request* for no kids. One guest was a massive asshole and ignored the request, but it's not OP's prerogative to play bouncer at the wedding. If the Bride chooses to avoid the conflict, that's her choice.\n\nHell it's her wedding. If she wanted to make a rule that says OP specifically cannot bring her child, well that's the bride's choice.", "Child-free weddings are most definitely NOT idiotic. I had one, best thing I ever did. If you can\u2019t find a sitter, don\u2019t come. We were paying for it, it was our wedding. Don\u2019t like our rules, don\u2019t come. Plain and simple. The ones who cared enough about us and respected our wishes did as we asked, and I heard later from multiple couples with kids that they had an awesome night out without them. Parents need a break too, and kids don\u2019t belong at every event. It\u2019s not that people with child-free weddings hate kids. That\u2019s a pretty ignorant statement to say.", "My partners niece is outgoing, talkative and likes to play with people. I liked her.\n\nThen she started being bossy, not listening to no, testing boundaries, screaming, kicking and hitting her dad when he makes her stop annoying behaviour. \n\nNow when I see her I just think \"Fck, this again\". Kinda makes me not even wanna have kids anymore.", "My niece is the same, and has caused arguments between me and my brother because he hates having anyone other then him or our mum parent her - so she gets to cause loads of problems which the rest of the family has to just ignore because we can't ever tell her \"no\".", "Satan was a fallen angel.", "Yes you can. My cousin ignored our CF wedding invite. I had them physically barred from entering.", "I've been in both situations too. \n\nMy sister is getting married this year. I assumed no kids and was looking forward to a night just hubby and I, but nope she wants them there. \n\nYTA", "Seriously. Gossip about how rude the cousin is in politely hushed tones like a normal person.", "If your kids are raised right having them around makes family events more fun", "Stop being reasonable, everyone wants to dunk on op from every possible angle", "She's upset because she sees her child as an extension of herself. In her eyes, \"rejecting\" him is in essence rejecting her. What she probably really wanted was for her family to get mad on \"her baby's\" behalf and kick the cousin out.", "Not wanting to make a scene, while understandable, has implications though. The sister is thus both implicitly accepting that someone is breaking the rules, what makes her an AH, and making that, while OP\u2019s actions are over the top, her feelings are justifiable.", "No but I think it should be thought about beforehand if you are going to have a childfree wedding. There\u2019s of Lyme people who don\u2019t think rules apply to them so thinking \u201cwhat will I do if someone brings their kid\u201d is valid. \n\nEven as a childfree person myself, I understand that it costs parents a lot of money to hire babysitters for extended periods like a wedding. Putting yourself in a position to require people to spend that money to attend your wedding (even if they are happy to) them let someone else just ignore it, will always cause friction.\n\nJust because others at the wedding did not react, we don\u2019t know that they aren\u2019t pissed off as well.", "I think a lot would have gone better if mum and sister had simply validated OPs feeling (which honestly were valid) if mum had said 'yes, it's so rude of cousin, sister is upset too but she wants to keep things quiet so she can enjoy her day' rather than 'calm down, let it go' I imagine OP would have (hopefully) let it go. OP behaved badly but I understand her feelings upset.", "I'm going to assume that the cousin didn't look too closely at the invitation and didn't realize it was child free.\n\nI guess everyone else just figured, \"the kid's already here, let's not make a scene and embarrass anyone.\"\n\n....and, yes,people find their own children way more adorable than other people do.", "ButOP didn\u2019t ask or talk to the bride privately. Instead he caused a scene. I wouldn\u2019t explain shit to someone causing a scene", "Lol but why?", "\nThe bride is an ah. Just because it's your wedding, it doesn't mean you can be excused for treating the same people differently. \n\nAnyone in op's situation would have felt angry, offended and discriminated in such situation, and asking why someone else was given such different treatment doesn't seem such an out of the world thing. She had the right to ask because that rule affected her day too. \n\nIf you don't want your wedding \"ruined\" don't make it so that such a situation could occur.", "Then, if you're too busy with other things you wouldn't notice if other kids were around either and should've just not made that rule. \n\nIt's the principle. You don't want kids ? Then they leave with their parents who were too egocentric to follow your requests. \n\nYou don't get angry at someone else who has followed your rule for feeling discriminated.", "Huh", "Well, yes, probably. That isn't a healthy place. It's an entire echo chamber of people who weaponize therapeutic language and encourage manipulative tactics. And no one there can tell the difference between rules, demands, and boundaries. Everything is a boundary, apparently."]}
