I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn\u2019t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. \n\nThe wedding day comes and my fianc\u00e9 and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.\n\nAt the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??\n\nAt one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I\u2019m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was \u201cruining her special day\u2019. I couldn\u2019t believe it! My fianc\u00e9 and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.\n\nEver since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister since and I don\u2019t plan on it until I get an apology. AITA?\n\nEDIT: People keep saying that I should not have brought this up at the wedding. But when should I have brought it up??

Your poor sister already had to deal with one guest ignoring her wishes and probably decided to  just let it go and focus on enjoying her wedding day. I\u2019m guessing the last thing she wanted to deal with was confronting your rude cousin and kick out a 3 year old. \n\nThere weren\u2019t different rules for different people, your cousin just decided to ignore the rules and your sister decided to make the best of an annoying situation. \n\nInstead of being empathetic and following your sister\u2019s lead, you decided to make it about you and your feelings, and made a scene.

Take it out somewhere else. You behaved like a spoiled child.", "Info: did the cousin bring the child against bride and groom\u2019s wishes?\n\nAnyway, YTA probably. Even though you followed the rules you should\u2019ve let it go because your kid was already at home with a sitter and your cousin\u2019s kid was already at the wedding.

She likely didn\u2019t mention it because *she wanted to avoid making a scene*. It\u2019s her wedding, she doesn\u2019t want that rule violation to be what her guests remembered. She could address it with the cousin later to ensure people are more focused on the matter at hand- her marriage. But you decided to act like a crazy person and start calling people out and acting angry because she didn\u2019t say anything right then and there and you felt unreasonably upset about something that your sister had no control over. \n\nIt was a child free event. Someone broke the rules. As to not cause a scene, your sister allowed it likely with the intention of handling it privately and you decided you should try to confront both the cousin and your sister. Why? Because you regret respecting your sisters wishes about her own wedding being child free when your cousin didn\u2019t? Because obviously your sister didn\u2019t make an exception, as you acknowledged. So it seems like you are just angry that you respected your sisters wishes.

Others are more serious, like using your fork to pick your nose. \n\nA gracious host does not draw unnecessary attention to a guest's social mistake. If possible, she glosses it over. A gracious host does not want any of her guests to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. That's why your sister and mom were trying to get you to stop.

You made a scene because someone else brought a child, and instead of letting it go, you acted like a child yourself. You need to apologize. It wasn\u2019t your place to say anything to your cousin. Chances are, either your sister chose to let it go, or she allowed the child. If she allowed that child but not your son, maybe look at your sons behavior.

What did you want your sister to go roundhouse kick your cousin during the wedding?", "YTA - Your cousin did the wrong thing brought a non-invited kid to a kid free wedding but your sister decided to be gracious about it, there's nothing wrong with that.

Yeah, it sucks that the cousin brought her kid to a childfree wedding, but it was also clear that no one wanted to make a scene and ruin the wedding by fighting over it. \n\nAnd what did you do?

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your sister was also annoyed at your cousin for bringing her kid, but as the bride didn\u2019t want to publicly question why a guest broke her rule.

I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn\u2019t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. \n\nThe wedding day comes and my fianc\u00e9 and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.\n\nAt the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??\n\nAt one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I\u2019m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was \u201cruining her special day\u2019. I couldn\u2019t believe it! My fianc\u00e9 and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.\n\nEver since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister since and I don\u2019t plan on it until I get an apology.

They probably realised that making an issue of it would cause a scene and be worse than just dealing with the child being there. Shame you didn\u2019t also realise that. You causing the scene in fact is more detrimental than your cousin ignoring the no kids rule", "It's her wedding, her guest, her problem to solve. I'm betting she will or already has had words with the cousin about bringing the kid. She didn't want to cause a scene at the wedding, so let it go. She's the one who gets to make that call. It had nothing to do with you. \n\n\nYet you felt the need to make snide comments to another guest, demanded to know why she gets her kid and you don't, wouldn't let it go when asked to knock it off, caused a scene, then stormed out of the wedding. All because you were annoyed someone else got away with breaking the rules.", "Was she very clear about not wanting her relatives to act like petty squabbling assholes?  Did she need to be explicit about that, or can we just assume on her wedding day she didn\u2019t want to deal with petty ass drama from her siblings or cousins?

Sure, they didn't want kids there, but many people would rather just let them stay than kick them out.", "I imagine this is what happened.

Someone broke the rules. As to not cause a scene, your sister allowed it likely with the intention of handling it privately and you decided you should try to confront both the cousin and your sister. Why? Because you regret respecting your sisters wishes about her own wedding being child free when your cousin didn\u2019t? Because obviously your sister didn\u2019t make an exception, as you acknowledged. So it seems like you are just angry that you respected your sisters wishes.

My venue has both indoor and outdoor spaces, so I'm using the FAQ to let my guests know the ceremony will be outdoors since they may want to dress with that in mind and wouldn't know otherwise.  Where else would I put something like that?  Our venue can also be tricky to park at, so this is a great space to give guests a heads up about the fact that they may need to leave extra time to park and/or carpool.  \n\nIn my experience, the FAQ is actually a very useful and considerate thing to have since you can make sure your guests know everything they need to know in advance without them having to reach out and ask you.  As a guest, I've only ever appreciated FAQ pages.", ">Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. \n\nI read this as a FAQ page being IN the invitation, not on the website.

They don\u2019t care and won\u2019t remember.\n\nThis is what I never understand from the people who get upset about adult-only events/places, why get mad about having some time away from parenting? You'll certainly be parenting again when you get back!", "Let me get you a hankie", "OP didn't just ask a question. She complained to her mother, made a rude comment to another guest, and when asked to knock it off, she kept going. That sounds more like she was trying to pick a fight because another guest broke the rules. The bride just chose not to make a fuss about it the day of the wedding. How is she an AH?", "But what was the sister supposed to do about it at the wedding? Kick her cousin out? That\u2019s annoying but she should let it go.", "I can see your point of view, and I was NTA until she caused the scene.

That\u2019s really where you\u2019re coming down on this?", "Plus, it seems like it was only the cousin who brought their child and everyone else followed thr rules. I also notice she didn't say the child was loud or caused any type of disturbances. \n\nI'm guessing maybe the cousins babysitter fell through and so they brought the kid. It seems everyone understood and kept asking her to drop it and she wouldnt", "> At the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious!\n\n> At one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I?\n\nMom and the bride didn\u2019t escalate anything. OP made comments about the cousin _repeatedly_ throughout the day.", "Eh. I had a child free wedding and if someone showed up with their kid I'd roll my eyes but I wouldn't kick them out. Too many other things to pay attention to on my special day than one family member who didn't listen.", "I don\u2019t disagree that it was an option but the bride isn\u2019t an AH for how she decided to handle it.

That baby is part of the family. When he gets older, he\u2019s gonna ask \u201cWhere was I?\u201d Even if he doesn\u2019t ask, it\u2019s a lot to ask a new mom to be away from their child *all day* which is what\u2019s usually required of bridesmaids.

It\u2019s okay for some events to be adults-only events.  \n\n(Also, usually \u201c4M\u201d means four-year-old male, not four months old, so OP isn\u2019t a new mother leaving an infant all day.)", "I\u2019m in the US too. And I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say 99% of the weddings I\u2019ve gone to included *at least some* kids. I still wouldn\u2019t leave my 4YO all day for a wedding, even for family. I thought OP meant 4 months since she later said \u201c3 year old.\u201d Also what about \u201cBe in my wedding, pay for all this stuff, and oh yeah hire a babysitter for 6+ hours\u201d sounds so Bridezilla and gross to me.", "Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing?  I\u2019ve definitely left my kids all day and even overnight to attend kid-free weddings.  And same with being in the wedding party.  \n\nI do remember when I got married years ago and we said kid-free and most guests (including family) were cool with it but one couple made a big fuss about it (who knows why) . . . and then when they married a few years later, they also had a kid-free wedding.  Just a matter of preference."]}
