I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn\u2019t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. \n\nThe wedding day comes and my fianc\u00e9 and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.\n\nAt the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??\n\nAt one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I\u2019m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was \u201cruining her special day\u2019. I couldn\u2019t believe it! My fianc\u00e9 and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.\n\nEver since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister since and I don\u2019t plan on it until I get an apology. AITA?\n\nEDIT: People keep saying that I should not have brought this up at the wedding. But when should I have brought it up?? It seems WORSE to bring it up AFTER the fact doesn\u2019t it?\n\nEDIT #2: To be clear, I originally wasn\u2019t mad at my sister. I was upset at my cousin and slightly upset at my family for not saying anything when they saw the child (I didn\u2019t want a fight to happen, just for them to hold her accountable). However, I got upset at my sister when she got mad at me for bringing it up. I feel like I deserved to let my cousin know how I really felt and I wanted my sister\u2019s support since I followed the rules.", "created_utc": 1677542666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dr7mg/aita_for_pointing_out_hypocritical_rules_at_my/", "score": 5192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She could address it with the cousin later to ensure people are more focused on the matter at hand- her marriage. But you decided to act like a crazy person and start calling people out and acting angry because she didn\u2019t say anything right then and there and you felt unreasonably upset about something that your sister had no control over. \n\nIt was a child free event. Someone broke the rules. As to not cause a scene, your sister allowed it likely with the intention of handling it privately and you decided you should try to confront both the cousin and your sister. Why? Because you regret respecting your sisters wishes about her own wedding being child free when your cousin didn\u2019t? Because obviously your sister didn\u2019t make an exception, as you acknowledged. So it seems like you are just angry that you respected your sisters wishes.

A gracious host does not want any of her guests to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. That's why your sister and mom were trying to get you to stop.

Maybe she broke the rules, or maybe she couldn't get a sitter, and unlike you she talked to your sister and asked for an exception? Either way, it's none of your business.", "YTA.

I (26F) have a son (4M) who is the only grandchild on my side of the family. Everyone love him and he loves his aunt. During early wedding planning, my sister suggested that she wanted to have a kid-free wedding, but I didn\u2019t think she was serious as it was so early on. Then, when the invitations came out, I saw on the FAQ page that this was, in fact, a kid-free wedding. I talked to our mother about it and how I was shocked, but she stayed neutral and I didn\u2019t talk to anyone else about it. Now I am not one to start fights, so I obliged and found a babysitter. I was a bit upset, but I tried to still be supportive. \n\nThe wedding day comes and my fianc\u00e9 and I take our seats and wait for the ceremony to start. While waiting, I see my cousin sit behind us with her 3 year old daughter. I was shocked! It was made very clear to everyone about the no kid rule so I was sure that my family (who adores my sister) would tell my cousin something. Instead, everyone said hi to them and talked about how cute the child was. I was appalled and knew my sister would be upset.\n\nAt the reception, I went up to my mom and asked her what she thought of my cousin brining her child. My mom said that it didn\u2019t matter that much and that we should all just let it go. But I was furious! How was this fair at all??\n\nAt one point during the wedding, my cousin, sister, and I went to go take a photo at the photo booth area. After the photo, I turned to my cousin and jokingly said \u201cI guess kid-free wedding means different things to different people!\u201d My cousin was shocked and look at my sister and my sister told me to knock it off and that everything was fine. I told her why should I? I followed the rules and left my son at home. My sister told me to calm down and I told her I was calm just confused. I guess we drew attention form some of the other guests and my mother came over and pulled me aside. She told me to stop causing a scene and I said I\u2019m not causing a scene, but simply asking why different rules apply to different people. My sister came over and told me to stop and that I was \u201cruining her special day\u2019. I couldn\u2019t believe it! My fianc\u00e9 and I left because I could not stand to be in the same room as my sister then.\n\nEver since the wedding, my mom has been telling me to apologize. I keep telling her that my sister should apologize to ME. I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister since and I don\u2019t plan on it until I get an apology.

I'm trying to look at you as a whole, imperfect person with wonderful traits and flaws. Girl... What is going on here? Why are you so mad? What's making you mad? That's worth figuring out. I really hope you'll take my comment to heart. As someone who had some serious anger issues to unpack, I'm glad I did. My issues were different (I was never allowed to be mad and ate shit for everyone else), but ultimately, if you don't process anger well, it's like you're taking poison and expecting the other person to hurt.\n\nThis was long and a bit rambley, but I hope it helps you.", "YTA because it\u2019s not your sisters fault.

Hopefully they would all be adults about it and keep their thoughts to themselves but privately they would be annoyed or mad.

They\u2019re usually not. Why? Because there\u2019s always going to be those who think the rules shouldn\u2019t apply to them. Secondly, because they know said rule won\u2019t be enforced. Many brides will say \u201cchild free wedding\u201d but then not even enforce it for many reasons.

Why? Because they knew and said \u201cwhat are they going to do once I\u2019m there\u201d? So yes, people are indeed that entitled.

Since the kid was quiet, I'm sure everyone else just chalked this up to a shit happens scenario, and mentally just looked at the cousin as being tacky.

Instead of just talking to your sister about it BEFORE the wedding (maybe when the invites came out?), you are shocked that someone might have done that and gotten special permission to bring their child.

Finding a sitter for one night isn't a terrible inconvenience. (Unless, maybe, your 4 year old takes after you and is self-centered, egotistical, and confrontational for no reason.)

As other commenters pointed out, you don't know what circumstances led to your cousin bringing their child. Regardless, what kind of person disrupts their sister's wedding over something so trivial? \n\nThe answer, apparently, is an AH who believes their sister having a child free wedding is some sort of affront against them, because they weren't allowed to bring their 4 year old (the one with the world renowned personality, apparently) and because their sister didn't... what?

It's not on you. It's not your job. \n\nIt is far worse to bring it up during the wedding because there's still stuff going on. There's an agenda, meeting people, dancing, being focused on the wedding. You bring it up means that the bride had to stop and appease your feelings when she also had been disrespected. \n\nThe way it looks when you bring it up after is \"what the heck happened there?\" \"Oh, cousin didn't listen to the rules. I wont invite them to another party\" etc.", "Idk why people think your an asshole. That cousin is an ass for not reading the invite and understanding the rule she made in place.

My youngest is exactly the same! He\u2019s bright, confident, outgoing and friendly. But MAN he\u2019s a short doses sort of kid", "Yea. This subreddit has caused a lot of people to think of the worst in people. OP probably saw the cousin's kid, and thought they were being entitled to bring their kid. Instead of asking what happened, or believing in circumstances that may have been okay, OP jumped into \"we should make a scene, because reddit always says it's okay\".\n\nThe sister was trying to give cousin a pass, because of ANY circumstance that she was aware of. Maybe cousin had an issue last minute and had no alternative, maybe sister wanted to ignore it because ONE person breaking the rules isn't going to ruin her day, maybe sister just doesn't like OP's kid because OP forces the family to pay attention to her. There's a lot to consider here, and OP didn't spend any time trying to figure out WHY the situation is the way it was.\n\nOP was just passive aggressive the whole time, and expected sister to go nuclear on the cousin.", "Right?

My sister had a child free wedding, and the one exception was my BIL's one-year old nephew. I saw no issue with that, but a couple of people commented on why their kids couldn't come.

And you shouldn't have to answer to anyone for doing so.", "Since only one cousin broke the rule it is impossible for us to judge whether the bride was \u201cunfair\u201d in her enforcement of the rule. Had OP brought her son too would the bride have kicked them out and let the cousin stay?

Make a big fuss about it. OP chose two. I have the feeling that even if no other kids had come, OP still would have made passive aggressive remarks about it.\n\nYou're right, OP raced to Mommy to demand Sis change her wedding for OP'S comfort. That's a no go. Then when OP felt that someone else got something they weren't (without context of who might have asked questions to whom), they had to keep picking at it.\n\nIf OP was that sad their son couldn't come, they could have opted not to come, too.

From the bride's perspective I'm guessing she just wanted to enjoy her wedding day, decided to let it slide for the moment and would address it privately with the cousin when she wasn't in the middle of her wedding so that there wouldn't be a scene and she didn't have to get all worked up.

It's entirely possible that she received the invitation, saw when and where it was, and may have skimmed the FAQ's. If I was going to a wedding for my cousin, I would probably assume there wouldn't be anything for me in the FAQ's because I'm somewhat \"in the loop\" and I probably don't have any questions about attending a wedding ceremony. \n\nIt probably would have been better if the \"kid-free\" rule was right on the front of the invitation where it normally is, but hindsight is 20/20.
