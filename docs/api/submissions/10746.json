By your own logic, she apologized so she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nYou see how fucking dumb that sounds?\n\nIt was an accident. Yelling at your significant other is not okay at any point, much less over something so trivial. You made her feel like you care more about the stupid controller than her feelings. She apologized and you basically told her her apology meant jack shit. And based on her saying \u201cyou can be really mean sometimes\u201d tells me you probably flip out on her over little things often. \n\nFrom one of your comments your parents did that to you a lot. Seek therapy, your childhood trauma is not an excuse to treat your girlfriend like crap.", " YTA. Control yourself. Will your entire existence be over if a little bit of liquid spills on your controller? No. Wipe it off and grow up. People make mistakes, and she apologized. Sit her down, apologize for snapping and move on.", "YTA, you were mean, and even if you apologized, she gets to feel her feelings about it before immediately getting over it.  I have a feeling this wasn't the first time something like this happened.", "YTA and you sound mean as hell. Get that under control man, accidents happen and you don\u2019t have to be bitter and vindictive when they do.\n\nAlso, this \u201cI apologized so there\u2019s no reason for her to be mad\u201d is an arrogant, twisted view on what it means to ask for forgiveness. \u201cSorry\u201d isn\u2019t just a word you use to make people less mad at you. It\u2019s an expression of genuine regret and eagerness to make things right. You don\u2019t only sound mean, you sound immature and self-centered too.", "Ngl the idiocy of this post and the fact that it's almost impossible to read bc of your god-awful shitty grammar makes it seem like you're actually 13.  \n\nYTA big time.  Who tf holds tea while they have a controller anyway?  Put the video game away for crying out loud if you're in the middle of drinking something.", "Dude.  Learn to chill.  First off, yelling wasn't the only problem.  You also need to apologise for being an ass.  It's easy.  I'll even give you an example: I'm sorry I snapped at you, that was uncalled for.  I was upset about my controller and took it out on you.  I'll do my best not to let it happen again.\n\nThen you *do your best to not let it happen again*.  Find some better ways of managing your emotions.  YTA.", "YTA. Who has tea so close to a delicate controller? I highly doubt her intention was to sit so hard on the couch to make you spill onto your controller. Your anger is misdirected. I\u2019d be embarrassed of myself if I did this to my BF over a replaceable object.", "So let me get this straight\u2026 she did something that you didn\u2019t like, she apologized, and you got even meaner.

It was an accident, she apologized and you blasted her for it anyway. Could she have been more careful? Of course! But there were a whole bunch of ways you could've handled it better.", "Lmfao.
