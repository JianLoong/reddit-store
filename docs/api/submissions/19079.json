Sounds like the name is free to use again.", "The grandmother is referenced in the past tense of it makes a difference", "What about Zahara for her kid?", "Just to dispel any myths- I\u2019m a dog trainer, and it\u2019s super simple to retrain a name; doesn\u2019t cause any distress to the dog :) I\u2019m def not saying rename your dog in this situation though. Just popping in for the truth about dog training. For the record, if you want to change the command to anything, simply say the new word first, pause, then say the old command. Repeat until the dog starts responding to the new command, then fade out the old command. We do it ALL the time, especially for cues like \u201cdrop it\u201d that people tend to mess up. All the best.", "My oldest is named after an adorable dog who occasionally hung out army office. Coworker would dog sit for a friend from time to time & I loved the dog\u2019s name. I told him when he was a toddler & he loved being named after a cute puppy.", "I also have only adopted and fostered adult dogs. They all eventually respond to whatever name you pick", "Oh, please, stir the pot!\n\n(I readily admit that I'm petty, and an A-H.)\n\n(AND not wise like your husband.)\n\nBTW, NTA", "I'm aware of the relationship. It was spelled out pretty clearly in the original post. Thanks for the clarification though.", "What does the SIL want to do with the name?", "Great name for a child.  They'd have a good heads on their shoulders.", "Zapdos!!!!!", "if there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now", "So you think she should give birth to a president?", "Beeblebrox ?", "Not true, it\u2019s as simple as adding a new cue or changing an old cue :) definitely not months of detailed work.", "What do you mean about people messing up the \"drop it\" cue? What's the funniest cue you have seen someone mess up?", "Just seems like she isn\u2019t really in a position of having much say about the tolerating.", "the kid aint the one asking for a namechange sweetheart", "Disagree. I have inlaws I do not tolerate in my own life. Cut toxic people out. Demanding someone change their dogs name because, because you want the name for your own child is toxic af. \n\nAnd believe it or not, nobody is obligated to tolerate that in their life. \n\nShe should flip her SIL the bird and move on with her life. Maybe welcome her back if she ever learns any common sense. Otherwise... spend that energy on taking her dog for a walk.", "Ok then!", "Of course that\u2019s toxic but my brother is dope. A little stupid about women but I love him. Would absolutely make fun of her to her face and make my perspective clear. Definitely wouldn\u2019t change my dogs name. Probably would give my dog a middle name and it would be sils name. I have a feeling SIL is dealing with intense pregnancy hormones and is going to feel really stupid soon\n\nI\u2019ve cut relationships with people in real life so I get it but your response was scorched earth.", "Eh, I love my own sister but hardly ever see her because her husband is a damned MAGA fool, who can't shut up about it. I've given him plenty of opportunities to hang out, but he always goes on lectures and diatribes about... whatever. He is slowly removing himself from all of his own friends.\n\nAnd I've got 3 kids, I've been around pregnancy hormones, and yes they do make women a little... different. (No disrespect to women, or pregnant women, but please, sometimes yall do get a little unpredictable, (yes I'm an asshole and I am not trying to downplay the experience yall are going through, but for real even my wife called it pregnancy brain)).\n\nAnd it's not scorched earth to simply let people live their own lives without being involved. \n\nIt's simply respecting the fact that sometimes relationships age out, people grow apart, and instead of meeting them on a hill they want to die on, you walk around it, and hope they catch up down the road when they learn some sense. \n\nBut her SIL has no grounds to tell her to change her dog's name. \n\nScorched earth would be changing the dogs name to the same name as her SIL's\n\nIn fact I wish I suggested that. Good thinking u/aggleclack", "So you\u2019re a dude who says pregnancy hormones are *sorta* *maybe* related but you don\u2019t know. Read the comments here. A lot of women are saying they regretted some of the crazy shit they did when pregnant. It\u2019s an unfortunate reality. I haven\u2019t had kids. I don\u2019t know if the hormones are related. It\u2019s safe to consider that they could be and that women who have had kids might be the experts.\n\nYou also explained a ton of backstory that led you to your choice about your family but you started this by saying op was an asshole for even talking to SIL when you don\u2019t actually know if there is back story or nuance.\n\nPeople growing apart is a hugely different than saying someone is an asshole for having a specific relationship that you know nothing about.\n\nEdit: oh and you *hardy ever see* your sister IS NOT the same thing as cutting them off. It\u2019s also not the same as \u201cYTA for tolerating such an idiot in your life.\u201d"]}
