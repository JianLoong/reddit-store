And above comment from trainer - retraining isn\u2019t that tough, more of a PITA, but that\u2019s not the real issue - she wants the name and demanding you change your pups name isn\u2019t that big of a deal - neither is her finding a different name.

I've been down that road repeatedly and I stand by this point. I was trying to not be harsh and speak in absolutes, but bitches be crazy, and it triples when they get knocked up. Hormones are wild like that. Just look at the shit teenage boys do. Different type of crazy, but different hormones as well. (Seriously to all the women, pregnant or not, I mean no disrespect.)\n\nI said OP was an asshole for tolerating such idiocy. Not for talking to her. Subtle difference, but let's get it correct.  Also, I followed it up with the next sentence by saying, \"Okay, in all seriousness\", which I thought implied sarcasm in the previous statement, but apparently context is not your strong point, so maybe put some wrinkles in your brain, and learn the nuances of written language and the implications that can be made by not saying something outright.\n\nAnd yes, I rarely see my sister. Because of her husband. I cut him out. Not her. Refer to my point above, and maybe use the whole lesson on context to utilize a little reading comprehension. (Just cause they are married doesn't mean they are conjoined twins, they can actually exist separate from each other.) \n\nAnd while people growing apart may be different than saying someone is an asshole, I will say you are an asshole, and I feel we are growing apart. \n\nAnd I'm an asshole for tolerating your idiocy in my life. \n\nIs that nuanced enough for you? Or do I need to name my dog u/Aggleclack?", "By the way, sorry if I've been disrespectful, I have been, and it's rude and I apologize for it. I've honestly enjoyed our debate. I need to work on how I say things, and need to not be rude. \n\nTruly I have enjoyed the argument, and wish you nothing but the best.
