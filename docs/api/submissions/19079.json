You named your dog 6 years ago, you're absolutely NTA for not wanting to rename it now). She can either name her daughter the same thing and deal with it until the dog passes or find something new.", "NTA, let her know that since you have had the dog six years everyone in the family already knows the dog's name and even if you change it they will still think she named her gremlin after the dog.", "SIL needs to chill out and find another name!  You\u2019ve have had your dog for 6 years and SIL expects you to change the poor dog\u2018s name?!  Nonsense!", "NTA.  All of my pets have traditional human names.", "NTA  \nTalk to all the Brunos, Bellas, Maxes, Izzies, Pennys, etc etc. \n\nNobody owns a name. If your SIL is bothered by her nonexistent-yet child sharing a name with a dog that is a \"she\" problem, not a \"you\" problem. \n\nLet her get upset if she wants to, it really is her choice to get pissed over something so dumb.

That\u2019s just a ridiculous demand. I can see maybe being upset if she had her daughter first and you decided to name you dog the same but still\u2026ridiculous.", "NTA. The dog has been trained for 6 years to recognize its name, exactly because it is a dog and not a person it will not understand why suddenly it is being called differently. Even more so, when the niece grows up and people start calling her by name, I assure you the dog will react too. Honestly, tell your sister there is nothing \"embarrasing\" to have a dog-namesake - the kids love stuff like that. And even if she doesn't accept it - tough luck, she got pregnant 6 years too late. I am sure there are plenty of other nice hebrew names with Z at the start (why not just take the grandma's name??).", "Lol NTA, gorgeous name though.\n\nMy in laws have a cat with the name we picked out for a future boy.

There's an easy answer to her discomfort: she can choose a different name.  As you suggested.\n\nWeird hill for her to die on.", "Lol what?\n\nYou're NTA. If she doesn't want her child to share a name with your dog, there's a very simple solution. Even she can probably work out what it is.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour dog has had the name for 6 years and retraining it now to a new name is a stupid idea.\n\nTell your SIL that she is ridiculous and to choose a different name if she is put off by naming her daughter the same name as your dog", "NTA- wow. No, dog keeps its name and has had it for years.  Baby isnt even born yet so she can choose a different one.", "NTA  tell if she thinks it will be embarrassing for her daughter, tell her it will embarrassing the dog too. The whole thing is silly, you can't run around changing names - and most people think it's funny. My friend named her cat after me and we both survived ( for the record the cat didn't seem to care much). Just ignore her.", "NTA. The dog has had that name for 6 years and your sil doesn\u2019t own the name.

Your dog would always be attached to the name even if you started calling her something else to make your SIL happy. If she wants to use it, fine.
