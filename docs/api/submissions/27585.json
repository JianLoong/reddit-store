{"id": 27585, "submission_id": "16rfad4", "title": "AITA for not splitting my inheritance with my half sister?", "selftext": "My divorced father died without a will so his estate is being split between me and my full sister, but there is a third half sister (mom's child from before they were married) who did not inherit. She wants 1/3.\n\nMy 9 year old kid has a severe cleft lip and palate and will need significant dental work and a series of dentures to cover a hole in the roof of his mouth (50/50 chance that surgery can repair it). I also have a cleft and cleft related dental problems that I would like to have addressed. I am a single mom and my financial situation is not at all good. I want to hold on to the bulk of my inheritance as it is enough to cover our dental work and get us a very modest rural house, but not much more than that.\n\nMy full sister is well employed and expects to give our half sister 1/3. I feel that I can not do the same but I am willing to send her some money every year. They are both upset and want to dictate how I share my inheritance even hinting that they should be able to review my tax returns to see the tax rate I withdraw my inherited IRA at.\n\nLike me, my half sister also does not have a good financial situation, but it is in many ways it is self inflicted, for example her and her husband both have current DUI and so neither has a drivers license.  They also have kids but their kids are adults.\n\nThere is much more to the story. My relationship with both of my sisters is very poor. My half sister who wants 1/3 ridiculed me for being a loser and told me I am gross, and my full sister is nastier but more professional in how she goes about her insults. Neither was close to my father. In fact the sister who wants 1/3 had not taken the time to go and visit him even once in the last 20 years but did do one visit when he was on death's door.\n\nAlthough I hate it and feel bullied, I am willing to send a yearly amount to keep the peace, but unless my financial situation significantly changes, it would not be 1/3. All three of us will inherit from my mother but hopefully not for a very very very long time.\n\nI expect to take my sweet time making any decisions about this, they want to rush me, but there is no good reason for that.

He did not. Therefore, he did not intend for his stepdaughter to inherit from his estate. Presumably, your father took on board that his stepdaughter never came to visit and made his arrangements accordingly.

That was what your father wanted.  Keep your half.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She\u2019s not entitled to anything. She didn\u2019t have a relationship with your dad, and is a bully.

Use it to help yourself and your child have a better life.  Don't worry about what your unkind and uncaring sisters ask for.  You don't have to listen to them.  You are a mother and your only obligation is to your child.  Your half sister is not your fathers daughter and she didn't have a relationship with him so I see no moral obligation here.

I don't care what their situation is, you don't owe her or anyone else a single dollar. Please do not let them bully you out of what is rightfully yours.

Keep your money and get your medical needs addressed.", "This article was really good advice", "This right here!", "I agree with this. If my full sister is in a much better financial situation and if she wholeheartedly believes that our half sister needs more, she can give more", "My half sister grew up with my father and only ever met her bio dad once, so my father is the only father she knows. He did not adopt her as a child but instead wanted to wait until she was 12 and let her decide if she wanted adoption. At that point she was already shoplifting and smoking and did not at all get along with my strict father. She ran away at 15 and did not work to fix her relationship with dad since. She has had a pretty hard life. My full sister thinks a large influx of money will somehow fix my half sister's life, but I think it's more likely to be wasted, like when she was given house downpayment money but bought go-karts instead", "I am almost completely NC with both of them. When my dad was declining and I acted as his POA I felt obligated to keep them in the loop and not react to their bullying. Otherwise I go out of my way to avoid them. My whole life my relationship with my full sister has been one where she tries to control/punish and I try to avoid her. This is no different, the less traction I give her the less she can roll over me.  Thanks also for your response and the other responses", "Actually cleft related dental work doesn't stop at 18. Our saliva is more acidic and our enamel is often flawed. There is a lot of scar tissue. Adults who were lucky enough to get implants sometimes need bone grafting and new implants done as adults and the crowns themselves only last 10-15 years. \n\nIn my own treatment, I was missing one of my front incisors and my jaw there was defected. The dentist suggested because I was young we only do a marilyn bridge. Which is basically a tooth with two metal bars which are cemented to the back of adjacent teeth. This bridge soon fell off, when I was 19 or 20, and you wouldn't believe the things I had to do to afford a new bridge.\n\nDental trauma stories are common among cleft adults. My local dentist says I need about 24k of work but I want to see a periodontist with cleft experience first who may suggest a different route than a dentist who isnt really aware of the differences in cleft patients", "I avoid my full sister like the plague. She is absolutely toxic to me. \n\nMy half sister wasn't so bad until recently. She ran away when she was 15 and I was 8, so we didnt get the chance to know each other that well as kids but we've been mostly okay as adults. \n\nThings really deteriorated when my dad was declining and I was his POA. My full sister did not at all like me being in control rather than her and my half sister backed her in all things. They both were pretty nasty and I've avoided them and when I can't I've been as bland as possible since.\n\nI don't think my dad would have given her nothing but I don't think he'd have given her a third. I think maybe he didn't get around to his will just because he didn't want to deal with that question or whatever feelings he had concerning her. I do think a lot of her problems started by not being loved enough as a kid, but no amount of money I can give can fix her relationship with my dad", "I ask myself if her father left her something would she share it with me and the answer is no", "Your sister can still give her 1/3.  Of her own portion.", "Yes.  Giving her money would be a total waste!", "A large influx of money does not fix someone who sounds as troubled as your half sister. \n\nShe was gifted a sum of money for a house downpayment, and then did not follow through on that .  That is a red flag.\n\nYour father knew what he was doing.  He left you the money for YOU.\n\nYour sister is free do to what she want to with the money, but she can not dictate to you what you can do. \n\nGood Luck\n\nNTA", "Stay strong and true to your decision.", "thank you for the elucidation.  \nI really don't know much about it--but yes you should prioritize the work you need done(for you and your child).    \nplease don't let them bully you.", "I have decided to give myself a year to consider. If I end up doing a yearly payment it won't be until Dec 2024. I like the yearly payment idea partially because if she does buy a house and then doesn't make her payments as so often she hasn't made payments on things, I can then send money rather than having her tap our mom for it. I am very close with my mom and that is partially why I didn't tell them to bugger off from the get go. If I do a yearly thing it will be to keep the peace for my mom, not because I think my half sister is entitled. But I'll wait a year. I'll talk with my mom and feel and I won't make moves that make me feel uncomfortable and I won't engage with them"]}
