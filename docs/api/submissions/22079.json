Your therapist obeyed the law by breaking typical protocol and sharing things because they were concerned for yours or other\u2019s safety, in which case you would be t a if you sue\n\nIt basically hinges on whether the therapist can make a case that they had a good faith reason to be concerned, or you can make one that they didn\u2019t. With a history of blowing up at work, you have probably stacked the deck against yourself. EDIT: oops I misread, glad you haven\u2019t blown up at this job.

Depending on what state she\u2019s in, and if she\u2019s in a union, sometimes they can just let you go without any reason or they could try to find an excuse like if she\u2019s been late, or even dig through her documentation and claim a problem there. \n\nAnd if the therapist truly was concerned about the behavior, she would know better than to tell a personal colleague , and would do it through the appropriate channel is, and then OP may have actually been let go due to being unsafe. \n\nBut having said that, there are so many laws that allow healthcare workers to do remediation instead of losing their jobs. Such as for drug abuse and diversion and addiction issues, in order to get more people to admit they have a problem instead of hiding it and continuing, they allow for programs that if you voluntarily stick to the probation program, you won\u2019t lose your job or license.

You would have had to say you hurt a patient or coworker or had plans to. \n\nPersonally, I'm looking forward to you suing the f out of that therapist and your former place of employment. Your therapist and manager aren't professional enough to be employed in the capacities they are, and you deserve compensation for your lost wages, lost employment and advancement opportunity with your previous hospital, the stain/interruption on your resume, and the obvious mental distress and impact on your personal and professional life it would cause to have your private info floating around and your job gone because of it.\n\n(What is up with your friends by the way?

The first thing you need to do is DOCUMENT.\n\nStop what you are doing and write as much information down as you can about each interaction, time, date, state of mind, as much of the conversation as possible. Doesn't matter if it is small or large, write down EVERYTHING. \n\nNext, lawyer up. Don't question it. Lots of lawyers will work on commission. \n\nLastly, go through your social media and make sure you are private and delete ANYTHING about this issue that people can see, you don't want anything to screw this up for you. And if this is your main Reddit account? Don't give out any details you don't want public.\n\nGood Luck and sue their asses into the ground.", "In my opinion OP should post this over on r/legaladvice.\n\nIANAL, but the therapist absolutely had no business revealing anything to OPs employer.

We don\u2019t know that she blew up at anyone, we don\u2019t even know what her personal definition is of having an anger issue or how she interacted with anyone during that issue. So it\u2019s a little quick to say that she needs to learn to control herself or grow up because we don\u2019t know Actually what happens during these issues even though she finds them upsetting.

The mental health practitioner may have their license on the line if they do not warn the \"target\" directly.

Hopefully OP catches this, because if OP said anything that could be construed as a credible threat posing imitate dander to other people, the court could rule in the therapist's favor as they would have an ethical duty to inform the party at risk.\n\nThat said and as this was reported to OPs employer, something doesn't smell right. At least a consultation with a lawyer is warranted.\n\nEdit: Depending on what the lawyer says, it may also be wise to get a statement from OP's previous therapist.\n\nEdit 2, electric boogaloo: Also be sure to file an official complaint with OP's state's professional accrediting body. If this was a psychiatrist, it may be the American Psychiatric Society, if any other psych professional, could be the American Psychological Society. Could also be another specific organization.
