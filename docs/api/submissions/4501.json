{"id": 4501, "submission_id": "zj57nz", "title": "AITA for leaving my loud neighbors a written transcript of their conversation?", "selftext": "My husband (30M) and I (31F) live in a city apartment building that doesn't have paper-thin walls, but noise can travel from certain pockets to other places. For example we sometimes babysit for a friend elsewhere in the building where we can never hear neighboring sounds but from the kitchen you can hear the upstairs tenant's shower or bath running and any music they have playing in the bathroom. I'm not sure how it works but there you go. There's a young possibly postgrad couple living directly below us that we've never met but seen. They often have parties at night. And there's some echo pocket where if they are above a certain volume we can hear them directly in our bedroom as if they were just standing in the room next door.\n\nNormally I ignore it. But I work from home and if they are having day parties especially, it's very disruptive. So I left a note a few months back on their door saying that the noise does travel clearly and their conversations won't likely remain private if they continue at that level. Maybe passive aggressive, but I tried to word it friendly so it wouldn't come across that way - I genuinely just wanted to avoid confrontation and let them know that it's really that loud and clear. My husband thought it was a little strange but didn't have any strong opinions. It got much better for a while. However, now that the holidays are rolling around, it seems they are constantly partying day and night. We've knocked on the floors, and I left a similar note to the first under their door, but it seems not to make any difference.\n\nThe other morning I was up and trying to get my work together and it was like they were talking over my shoulder. So I paused and instead typed up a transcript of their conversation. It was minimal. A few lines and responses about shopping. I went out and put it on their door. It's been silent since.\n\nMy husband commented on the silence and I told him what I did. He reacted very strongly, saying that it was very weird and creepy. I responded that they knew there was no privacy if they were that loud and I was just showing them the case, I didn't write down anything personal, I make a strong effort not to listen to any gossip. But he thinks if they find out it was me it would cause more drama than it needs to be. AITA?\n\nETA: The sounds that travel aren't a regular speaking volume. That sort of sound I wouldn't be bothered by or care about. These conversations are very, very loud. Almost screaming. I only wanted to warn them that screaming private conversations doesn't keep things private.\n\nETA2: This was slipped under the door, not up for all to see.\n\nETA3: Thank you for the award! I'm glad it got some laughs and that some others can relate. To answer some questions and give last clarifications- I did add a vague \"please keep it down\" volume related point to the end of the note which I think made context clear. It was probably 20 seconds worth of conversation. I have written the landlady about this issue in the past and it may be worth raising to her again. I haven't confronted them individually truthfully because I was afraid once the first note had been given, I would be outing myself and my husband as those closeby. Yes, he isn't home during the day to enjoy the conversations.", "created_utc": 1670787111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj57nz/aita_for_leaving_my_loud_neighbors_a_written/", "score": 734, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I took out a notebook and wrote down the credit card number she was reading into her cellphone. I added her street address, because by then I had it memorized. Then I passed the note back up her.

Creepy in an effective yet hilarious sort of way. \n\nThe day I moved my daughter into her apartment, we could totally hear the convo her neighbors were having because there was a small air gap where the dividing wall met the brick exterior wall. I went and bought spray foam to close it off. It needed to be done from both sides, so I knocked on the neighbor\u2019s door, repeated a few sentences from their earlier conversation, and asked if they were ok with me coming in and filling the gaps in their side too for soundproofing.

These are shrieks. I wouldn't mind otherwise, but you can tell from inflection that these are screams.", "I think you made them think about what else they\u2019d been loud about, and that works for me.

In the mornings I'd be upstairs in my top floor bathroom and he'd be in his ground floor kitchen and we would literally TALK through the walls to arrange when to meet to walk in together. Neither of us had to raise our voices at all. I've lived in many flats since then and although noise often travelled nothing was as crazy as that place.

You let them know a couple times they were loud. They probably dismissed you as being uptight, and didn't realize how loud and clear their conversations are. You made sure they know, and now they're probably worried and embarrassed. \n\nI don't think your solution was weird in a bad way; I think it was more thinking out of the box.

This sound rating can be impacted by adding some sound dampening insulation in the wall cavity or ceilings (sounds like most issues with OP are the ceilings- not all developers care to dampen sound vertically), having \u201csoft\u201d finishes like drywall or carpet, or varying sheathing counts to prevent the trapping of sound in a space (say two drywall panels on one side of a wall and one on the other allows that energy an outlet). Placing drywall between double stud walls in between apartments can GREATLY reduce noise transference. It can also be the framing materials themselves. Wood typically transmits less sound than most light steel studs. It can also be that pipes themselves transfer sound through the apartments, this makes sense, they\u2019re hard to rate because depending on their placements (especially if there\u2019s no chase) you can\u2019t insulate them as much, *and* they\u2019re usually hollow allowing for a nice little echo chamber for sounds to travel down.", "NTA\n\n> Weird and creepy\n\nwould apply if you used a stethoscope or a microphone.\n\nThis sounds more like creative and unusual.\n\nAnd if it works, all the better!\n\nAnd of course, fuck loud and inconsiderate neighbors.", "NTA, but your husband is kinda chicken though", "NTA.

And I truly thank you for the laugh that the title gave me. You are also an absolute genius at passive aggressive point making!!", "I saw a post from someone who regularly overheard the neighbors having sex. Rather than recording them, they mimicked their noises loud enough for the couple to hear. It culminated with OP being able to anticipate the noises one of them was going to make, and then *making them on their own right before the neighbor did.* They were quieter after that. It was a hilarious read.", "LOL!! I used to live in an apartment complex, where many of the neighbors would spend spring summer and early fall nights I'll gather together outside partying talking and playing very loud music usually until about 4:00 in the morning. When I asked them could they turn it down, I was told that the rule was the first one to turn on their stereo gut control the music and the volume for as long as they wanted to keep the stereo on. I eventually put two very large speakers into one of my windows, took my two cats to my mother's house for the day, put in a CD with bagpipe music set it on continuous repeat and I went outside, and I stayed outside and kept it repeating from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 a.m. . When all of my neighbors were complaining and grumbling, I replied that they are the ones who set the rule and if they could be discourteous and make sure that nobody was resting or happy, then I must be able to do so as well. After that, the very next day I got up at 9:00 a.m. again and I put Nat King Cole on my stereo and I played it all day. I informed my neighbors I could either play nice music or I could play the bagpipes it all depended on whether or not they wanted to turn down the volume after midnight or not. I wasn't asking them to turn it off just turn it down so that things were not rattling in my apartment and I should have chance of getting some rest.\n\nFrom then on no later than 12:30 a.m. their stereos and whatever music they were playing, usually rap music was turned down by 12:30 a.m. .", "Lmaoooo. You\u2019re bringing back memories to my freshman year of college. I lived on a really noisy floor.  Generally, I just let the noise go, but one night I was trying to study for an important midterm and the girls in the room next door were having a party and being *obnoxious*. \n\nI noticed in my Wi-Fi network settings that said neighbor had an unsecured wireless printer.
