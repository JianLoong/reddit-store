{"id": 4501, "submission_id": "zj57nz", "title": "AITA for leaving my loud neighbors a written transcript of their conversation?", "selftext": "My husband (30M) and I (31F) live in a city apartment building that doesn't have paper-thin walls, but noise can travel from certain pockets to other places. For example we sometimes babysit for a friend elsewhere in the building where we can never hear neighboring sounds but from the kitchen you can hear the upstairs tenant's shower or bath running and any music they have playing in the bathroom. I'm not sure how it works but there you go. There's a young possibly postgrad couple living directly below us that we've never met but seen. They often have parties at night. And there's some echo pocket where if they are above a certain volume we can hear them directly in our bedroom as if they were just standing in the room next door.\n\nNormally I ignore it. But I work from home and if they are having day parties especially, it's very disruptive. So I left a note a few months back on their door saying that the noise does travel clearly and their conversations won't likely remain private if they continue at that level. Maybe passive aggressive, but I tried to word it friendly so it wouldn't come across that way - I genuinely just wanted to avoid confrontation and let them know that it's really that loud and clear. My husband thought it was a little strange but didn't have any strong opinions. It got much better for a while. However, now that the holidays are rolling around, it seems they are constantly partying day and night. We've knocked on the floors, and I left a similar note to the first under their door, but it seems not to make any difference.\n\nThe other morning I was up and trying to get my work together and it was like they were talking over my shoulder. So I paused and instead typed up a transcript of their conversation. It was minimal. A few lines and responses about shopping. I went out and put it on their door. It's been silent since.\n\nMy husband commented on the silence and I told him what I did. He reacted very strongly, saying that it was very weird and creepy. I responded that they knew there was no privacy if they were that loud and I was just showing them the case, I didn't write down anything personal, I make a strong effort not to listen to any gossip. But he thinks if they find out it was me it would cause more drama than it needs to be. AITA?\n\nETA: The sounds that travel aren't a regular speaking volume. That sort of sound I wouldn't be bothered by or care about. These conversations are very, very loud. Almost screaming. I only wanted to warn them that screaming private conversations doesn't keep things private.\n\nETA2: This was slipped under the door, not up for all to see.\n\nETA3: Thank you for the award! I'm glad it got some laughs and that some others can relate. To answer some questions and give last clarifications- I did add a vague \"please keep it down\" volume related point to the end of the note which I think made context clear. It was probably 20 seconds worth of conversation. I have written the landlady about this issue in the past and it may be worth raising to her again. I haven't confronted them individually truthfully because I was afraid once the first note had been given, I would be outing myself and my husband as those closeby. Yes, he isn't home during the day to enjoy the conversations.", "created_utc": 1670787111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj57nz/aita_for_leaving_my_loud_neighbors_a_written/", "score": 432, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are being kind to them; they don\u2019t realize that other, unscrupulous people could also be listening. There used to be a woman on my bus who would do all her business via cellphone, loudly. Over several weeks, we all got to hear her arranging bail money for her boyfriend, discussing personal health issues with friends, and one day I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I took out a notebook and wrote down the credit card number she was reading into her cellphone. I added her street address, because by then I had it memorized. Then I passed the note back up her. She threw a glorious tantrum, wanting to know who was spying on her, and someone else spoke up and said we ALL knew enough about her business, and she should save those conversations for a private location.

Otherwise, if it was me I would think someone was stalking me and would be hiding under my bed. \ud83d\ude02", "Well NTA only because you have left warnings before, and they were blatantly ignored. I'd probably be that petty too. But honestly, there should be a fix then if the sound travels that easily in certain pockets. Look into sound-proofing methods for sure.", "NTA. That was super effective so you did the right thing. They should know their conversations are bleeding into other apartments.", "NTA, and well played. Creepy in an effective yet hilarious sort of way. \n\nThe day I moved my daughter into her apartment, we could totally hear the convo her neighbors were having because there was a small air gap where the dividing wall met the brick exterior wall. I went and bought spray foam to close it off. It needed to be done from both sides, so I knocked on the neighbor\u2019s door, repeated a few sentences from their earlier conversation, and asked if they were ok with me coming in and filling the gaps in their side too for soundproofing.

Kudos for OP!", "nta but maybe you could have indicated with the transcript that you were anonymously complaining and not like stalking them. I had a stalker once and something like this would give me a panic attack. Hopefully they just made the connection to the earlier complaints, seems common sense but you never know.", "NTA.

Their noise disturbances go a bit beyond normal everyday sounds that happen when people live in close quarters (I\u2019m specifically thinking of the AITA where OP wanted to get his neighbor evicted because they had a small child who was not silent during the workday).

I heard some family drama I truly did not want to hear a while ago. And to be clear, I would have never listened and written that to them.", "My thoughts exactly", "Yes, it was super effective without making a formal complaint.", "This right here, it's good for them to know that if they're shouting at that volume everyone can hear their business, if they don't want their business heard they need to tone it down", "I edited to add, these aren't normal volume conversations. These are shrieks. I wouldn't mind otherwise, but you can tell from inflection that these are screams.", "I think you made them think about what else they\u2019d been loud about, and that works for me. Sometimes, telling someone they are being loud and disturbing just doesn\u2019t get through, because it doesn\u2019t seem loud to them.", "I'm genuinely unsure, I think NTA, *but* this is the ***exact*** level of petty that I aspire to be. Standing ovation.", "I love this! You weren't being a dick, but you proved your point.", "I wish that worked with my neighbors. NTA, you let them know about the issue beforehand and constant parties in apartments is just rude.", "NTA. One time my next door neighbour and her bf were arguing so loudly over something like the correct pronunciation of a word at 2AM so loudly that I ended up sending them a text with my opinion on the matter. Issue resolved without ever leaving my bed and I was never bothered again until the day she moved out", "NTA  \n\n\nThey have been warned, they decided to gamble with you, they lost their bet.", "NTA. I've always thought about the situations where people are having sex loudly that people should record it and then play it back for them to listen to, just as loudly, so the people get the point. I don't know if I'd actually do it, but I always think it'd work... in theory, to quiet people down.", "Exactly. It sounds like they're pretty careless and it's actually a good thing to find out just how much people can hear. NTA", "If it worked. NTA.", "NTA - it seems creepy because of the feeling that you are intruding on a private conversation, except that \\*they\\* are the ones really intruding on your personal space.\n\nAlso have a little less sympathy for these guys given you gave them 2 chances to correct their behaviour. That being said, awkward enough that you've probably cut off those neighbours as an option for when you need a cup of sugar or someone to water your plants, lol", "NTA this is great!

I'm in a similar situation. Sometimes referencing exactly what they're saying/listening to can drive home the point. When I ask them to please be quieter, not much of a response.

I\u2019ve heard waaaay too much information about somebodies colonoscopy on the bus before. Personal bubbles are weirdly out of whack these days.", "I wish there could be something done here. I live in a total shit sandwich of noises due to the traveling sounds. And to my knowledge the walls are concrete.\n\nOn my right I've had 3 neighbors the last 7 years. All students. One liked to have parties a lot. The next liked doing his dishes firmly at 8 pm. You would hear the dishes wobble in the aluminum sink. Now the latest one, likes to do his dishes at around midnight. He sings aloud while listening to music in his headphones. Yes, you hear urinating also.\n\nBelow me I have a middle-aged man living with his elderly mother. And the language out of him... oof.\n\nOn my left I currently have a young man who comes home drunk a lot. Smashes things. On top of randomly just outright shouting in the middle of the night. Or singing swedish tunes to hockey, also in the middle of the night. \n\nI would kill for soundproofing.", "How is it invading their privacy to stand in your own apartment and hear people through the walls?", "My parents tell a story of their friend whose neighbours had a very loud party & flatly refused to turn the music down.  So he recorded the lot & when it finally went quiet at about 6:00 am he set his speakers up outside, set it on repeat & played it back to them at top volume & when out for the day! It worked a treat.", "The armchair scientist in me is wondering if there's some way of figuring out how the sound is traveling so badly and interrupting it with some kind of decorative baffling. I think you handled it well, nothing says \"no, seriously, we can hear you REALLY CLEARLY\" like a transcript.", "When I was a teenager I lived in a 3 story terraced house and happened to work with the teenaged boy next door. In the mornings I'd be upstairs in my top floor bathroom and he'd be in his ground floor kitchen and we would literally TALK through the walls to arrange when to meet to walk in together. Neither of us had to raise our voices at all. I've lived in many flats since then and although noise often travelled nothing was as crazy as that place. I think it may have been possible due to the pipe work as non of the other rooms (even those that backed onto each other) were anywhere near as bad.", "NTA, you made it abundantly clear their conversations were disruptive and intrusive in the first letter, and you slipped the final transcript under the door to respect their privacy as you made your final point.", "NTA. You let them know a couple times they were loud. They probably dismissed you as being uptight, and didn't realize how loud and clear their conversations are. You made sure they know, and now they're probably worried and embarrassed. \n\nI don't think your solution was weird in a bad way; I think it was more thinking out of the box. I am glad you kept it anonymous though, sometimes people don't react well to these situations.", "NTA.  You are doing your neighbors a favor by letting them know the extent to which you can hear their private conversations.", "They know it you. You have been knocking on the floor and are home all day. Neighbors notice things like that", "It would be creepy if you were eavesdropping. You\u2019re not. You\u2019re actively trying to NOT hear what\u2019s happening.\n\nNTA", "Cackling at this lmao", "I\u2019m surprised no one has done a temporary sound baffle product that you can stick (and be removable) to walls. Or else it\u2019s been tried and can\u2019t be done cheaply enough to be a market for temporary renting situations.", "My building is kinda the same how OP describes and I quickly realized sound was traveling through the vents. I actually have magnetic vent covers up over my vents and had offered an extra one from the pack to a certain neighbor just so I could cut down the smell of smoking coming from their unit into mine through the vents as well."]}
