I agreed as I thought it would be a nice bonding experience with Erin. I don\u2019t know Erin all that well as my dad and I were previously estranged for years.  I am not in the wedding party, which I am ok with.\n\nWhen I turned up at the wedding dress shop, Erin was wearing a knee length, sleeveless summer dress (this is important). The assistant had already pulled some dresses for Erin based on what she said that she was looking for, these were kept in the changing room so I didn\u2019t see them before she came out in the first one. I had no idea what it was she was looking for, other than she wanted something that would go with a shawl she had from her mum. Erin\u2019s mum passed away a few years ago, so this was her something old.   \n\nWhen Erin came out in her first dress, it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. It was full length, with sleeves and covered her all the way up to her collarbones. The shawl was used as a head covering. This surprised me as she doesn\u2019t dress modest in her daily life, like the dress that she turned up in. She looked like one of those dolls that people used to cover toilet rolls. All the dresses were the same, she was covered up in every single one of them.\n\nI asked Erin why she had chosen those ridiculous dresses and offered to pick out a dress so she wasn\u2019t so covered up. Erin replied that it was important to her to be covered during her wedding. She explained she was raised in a mixed raise household, her mum was Muslim. When her mum married, she couldn\u2019t wear the modest dress as she was forced to conform to a traditional Christian wedding and it was one of her biggest regrets. Her mum had hoped Erin would wear a modest dress when she married, but Erin had chosen not to at the time as she wasn\u2019t particularly religious at the time. After her mum died, she became more religious but doesn\u2019t wear a head covering or dress modestly in her daily life. When Erin and my dad got engaged, she had decided that she would fulfil her mum\u2019s wish.  \n\nErin didn\u2019t say anything else to me about the dresses during the appointment. That evening, I got a text from my dad stating that he was disappointment that I had called Erin\u2019s modest dress wearing ridiculous. He said that Erin\u2019s religious beliefs weren\u2019t up for discussion or to be ridiculed and that she was disappointed in me. He wanted me to apologise to her.  \n\nAITA for calling the modest dress ridiculous?", "created_utc": 1681430045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lbzkm/aita_for_calling_my_dads_fianc\u00e9e_ridiculous_for/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Erin and OP are close in age than one usually expects from step parent/ children. Maybe there's something happening below the surface for OP causing her to act out. Still definitely YTA though", "I said \"oh, my\" out loud when OP said she offered to pick out the BRIDE'S dress. How OP can't see how much of an AH she is is beyond me.", "Most people don't wear poofy princess dresses or slinky Jessica Rabbit dresses either and yet those are incredibly popular wedding dress styles.\n\nIt's a wedding dress, no shit she doesn't usual dress like that.", "So yeah, don't tell anyone anything they're doing is \"ridiculous\" unless you want to be TA.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to say that MOST brides usually wear something different on their wedding day than they do in everyday life. YTA. You wanted a chance to get to know her and yet took the first opportunity to trash her to her face. You could have respectfully asked what exactly she was looking for in a dress and what made her choose that and then you could have become closer over the fact that you both care about your mothers, or like one of the same ideas about something. You shut the conversation down instead of being kind and opening it up. I would also recommend that you ask yourself if you\u2019re really ready to be in your dad and future step mom\u2019s lives. If not, that\u2019s okay! But there is no reason to be rude when you could just not engage.", "Did you say this before or after learning that she was raised Muslim and fulfilling a wish of her late mother's?", "Huge AH", "INFO please\n\n> especially when she doesn't usually dress like that\n\nyou mentioned this several times in your post as well\n\nwhat does her dress on other days have anything to do with this? people very very frequently wear something on their wedding day that is totally different from what they normally do, no??\n\nwould the dresses not be ridiculous if she usually dressed like this? I'm just lost at whatever it is you're trying to say, can you explain?", "YTA, her mother was bullied into wearing something, and now you\u2019ve done the exact same thing.", "Aaaaaaand that makes you an asshole.\n\nYTA", "I can see why no one wants to be around you......", "Why would you tell someone who you don't know well and want to get on with that their choices in attire for their wedding was ridiculous? Like in what world did this turn out well for you?", "There\u2019s a such thing as tact. If you really needed to bring it up (which I can understand as usually those invited to go dress shopping are also to get second opinions), a polite way would\u2019ve been to just comment that it wasn\u2019t her usual style and you were surprised by the choices, and *maybe* ask if she\u2019d considered X style because it would look good on her.\n\nCalling the dresses she chose \u201cridiculous\u201d was quite pointless.", "Most people don't usually wear wedding dresses in public, so why does her day to day wear differing from a wedding dress of all things matter? Much less when she's wearing it to honor her mom?", "You were rude. I hope you apologize", "You can make commentary but you need to have some tact. \"Why are you trying on these ridiculous dresses?\" is not appropriate. OP could have said something like \"I think you'd look lovely in a mermaid style. Why don't you try something like that?\" and then the bride could have explained without feeling like she was being ridiculed.", "You read the room and be diplomatic about your opinion. Wedding dress shopping can be a very emotional time for brides, especially if their mother is no longer alive or has a poor relationship with the bride. There are a lot of family and societal expectations that come into play. So while the decision is still the bride\u2019s to make, generally she asks for loved ones whose opinions she values to share this special day with her.", "Some shoppers want cheerleaders more than opinions, honestly, and there's nothing wrong with just going along to keep them company and holding your opinion until you're asked for it. But even if you have the kind of relationship where you are going to offer opinions and steer the bride toward what you think looks best on her, there are a lot of tactful ways to do that without insulting her preferences! Calling her choices \"ridiculous\" is not one of them.", "In my opinion if the bride doesn\u2019t ask for your opinion directly then you say nothing. I think the point of inviting OP was to bond with OP. I don\u2019t think she was asking for OPs input. \nBut I vote YTA because what she said and the way she said it was rude and mean spirited. There are many ways to give feedback without making fun of someone and embarrassing them.", "Exactly. I am baffled that is OPs main argument.", "No, I said it beforehand. She told me all that after I called her ridiculous.", "Username checks out. Man\u2019s a professional.", "Fair enough. Genuine question that might be important: did OP know Erin\u2019s mother had passed, or make a not-at-all-unfair assumption her mother divorced her dad?", "I reread OP\u2019s story, and genuinely, it didn\u2019t read as mean-spirited (to me). As written, as it\u2019s all we got to go off of, I could totally also see it as breezy, causal \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n(In my judgement, I advised her to apologize, though)", "After which you immediately apologised for being such a colossal AH, right? Honestly, the arrogance is unbelievable.", "If you had said it after that, then I could see where it might be interpreted as going against her religion. \n\nBut you were there to voice your opinion, although I might not have gone with \"ridiculous\" because that tends to be insulting. \n\nOnce she explained her reasons, how did you react? Did you apologize for misunderstanding?", "I would have back it up and stood by it after being told it was for religious reasons that she normally ignores. Why would you adhere to wierd religious crap on ir wedding day if you dont in ur day to day life, seems odd to me.", "I look at it as honoring a religious request from a dead parent. \n\nGrief isn't always logical and people do turn to religion for comfort in that. The fiance might feel closer to her mother by honoring that wish. \n\nReligion is also practiced on an individual basis. When and how the beliefs are followed is up to the individual. Most people do not adhere to all the tenants of their faith at all times. \n\nSo there is no reason to judge another's religious adherence, once it was explained. \n\nThe initial suggestion was understandable as it's off the way the fiance usually dresses. Once she explained her reasoning, as well as honoring her dead mother, the subject should be closed.", "Who cares? Why do they have to justify anything to you or OP?", "I guess I'm a bit much of an edgy athiest who just hates all religions. I can kind of understand the honouring dead mother thing but on the same hand the mothers dead and isn't going to know if you are honouring them so that feels a little weird to me as well. I guess I'm just looking at it the wrong way", "Happy Cake Day \ud83c\udf82", "I don't like religion either, but you honor someone for yourself. She cared about her mother, wishes her mother was there, and it's important for HER to remember her mother on this day. And I'm sure her mother was loved by other guests at the wedding, so it can be meaningful to them.\n\n\nMartin Luther King is dead, has no idea he has a day named after him. He's still worth honoring.", "I'm agnostic leaning atheist. \n\nBut I was raised in a fundy cult where you were expected to challenge everyone else's religious beliefs. \n\nAfter leaving that I realized that religious beliefs are a personal thing, I don't have to understand them. Just accept them. \n\nBecause of my past, the way I look at it is, no one wants a preachy (insert any belief). So why do they care about my lack of beliefs?"]}
