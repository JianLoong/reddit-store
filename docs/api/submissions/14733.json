I agreed as I thought it would be a nice bonding experience with Erin. I don\u2019t know Erin all that well as my dad and I were previously estranged for years.  I am not in the wedding party, which I am ok with.\n\nWhen I turned up at the wedding dress shop, Erin was wearing a knee length, sleeveless summer dress (this is important). The assistant had already pulled some dresses for Erin based on what she said that she was looking for, these were kept in the changing room so I didn\u2019t see them before she came out in the first one. I had no idea what it was she was looking for, other than she wanted something that would go with a shawl she had from her mum. Erin\u2019s mum passed away a few years ago, so this was her something old.   \n\nWhen Erin came out in her first dress, it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting. It was full length, with sleeves and covered her all the way up to her collarbones. The shawl was used as a head covering. This surprised me as she doesn\u2019t dress modest in her daily life, like the dress that she turned up in. She looked like one of those dolls that people used to cover toilet rolls. All the dresses were the same, she was covered up in every single one of them.\n\nI asked Erin why she had chosen those ridiculous dresses and offered to pick out a dress so she wasn\u2019t so covered up. Erin replied that it was important to her to be covered during her wedding. She explained she was raised in a mixed raise household, her mum was Muslim. When her mum married, she couldn\u2019t wear the modest dress as she was forced to conform to a traditional Christian wedding and it was one of her biggest regrets. Her mum had hoped Erin would wear a modest dress when she married, but Erin had chosen not to at the time as she wasn\u2019t particularly religious at the time. After her mum died, she became more religious but doesn\u2019t wear a head covering or dress modestly in her daily life. When Erin and my dad got engaged, she had decided that she would fulfil her mum\u2019s wish.  \n\nErin didn\u2019t say anything else to me about the dresses during the appointment. That evening, I got a text from my dad stating that he was disappointment that I had called Erin\u2019s modest dress wearing ridiculous. He said that Erin\u2019s religious beliefs weren\u2019t up for discussion or to be ridiculed and that she was disappointed in me. He wanted me to apologise to her.  \n\nAITA for calling the modest dress ridiculous?", "created_utc": 1681430045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lbzkm/aita_for_calling_my_dads_fianc\u00e9e_ridiculous_for/", "score": 1733, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it just that it\u2019s different from what you think is normal? Because that\u2019s the definition of bigotry. Is it that you think she\u2019s a hypocrite because she doesn\u2019t usually dress like that? If so, what about her touching and gracious explanation to your (incredibly rude) question is baffling to you?", "I can't figure out why you think that how she usually dresses and what she wears in her wedding should have any connection whatsoever. Can you elaborate on that?", "And that doesn\u2019t strike you as rude to say about someone\u2019s clothing choice? Even removing the context of it being her you know, wedding dress?", "So? Women don't normally wear wedding dresses around the house, so why should it be the same as what she usually wears? \n\nIt's really rude to call someone \"ridiculous\" for what she chooses to wear.", "I'm guessing in addition to wanting to honour her mum, marriage is sacred to her and she wants that to be reflected in her choice of dress.", "Some people just have class or tact whatsoever.", "Not your wedding & therefore not your choice to make. YTA & need to learn that your opinions aren't facts. You're old enough to know how rude you were, too. She wasn't ridiculous for picking gowns that *she* liked. However, *you* were for saying what you did. Grow up, apologize, & learn that not everything has to be how you see or believe it to be.", "Just because it's not your style or taste or something you would wear, doesn't mean it's open season for mockery.\n\nThere are day today clothes I wouldn't wear, but I would never tell anyone that their clothing choice is ridiculous. There is a way to be tactful and respectful when giving an opinion that doesn't result in insulting them.", "You bring friends to these things to get their opinions. Op didn't know she was going for modest or why she wanted modest. I know I've seen things on the rack that I'm like OMG THAT WOULD LOOK AMAZING! And they looked like utter shit on me.", "I guess because OP herself said she was basing it off what she knows of Erin, who AFAWK, hasn\u2019t dressed in a manner that would suggest modesty would be something she\u2019s into? Or that she wasn\u2019t calling Erin ugly or stupid AS a person? That the dress actually could\u2019ve been actually really ugly and unflattering (can\u2019t tell, only using OPs post, and I\u2019m not poo-pooing modest dresses) and she thought she was doing Erin a favor?\n\nThis whole thread is full of Y T A that I think are full of assumptions, and honestly, going off of what OP wrote, I think the scenario is a woman trying to be helpful to another woman she doesn\u2019t know very well, and coming into a situation where context and expectations are opposite of what I would think a wedding dress shopping experience would be. \n\nI\u2019ve written in other posts here, what\u2019s the point of the invited friends and family in this if they can\u2019t give opinions or comments?", "How is it \"funny\" that the bride wants to honour her mother's memory by dressing in a certain way?", "Same. It\u2019s so clear cut she\u2019s TAH. It would be good if there was some way to filter comments by answer, because I\u2019m wondering how anyone could justify voting the other way. I can\u2019t get my head round it, but then again, probably no one can.\n\nThe dress is nothing to do with her, and words like \u2018ridiculous\u2019 in this context are just rude and mean. Sad that Erin seemed to be trying to bond with her as well. Op, YTA, duh.", "I actually rechecked OPs age halfway through reading to see if she was a teenager. Mid twenties is far too old to have such a mind blowing lack of consideration of other peoples views and situations.", "She\u2019s is invited to the wedding tho. What? By \u201cnot in the wedding party\u201d she means she\u2019s just a guest. Wedding party includes being a bridesmaid, groomsmen, flower girl, ring bearer, sometimes the oficiante. Anyone involved with the whole wedding proceeding. She can still go attend the wedding", "Could be a lace shawl too, theyre quite trendy right now. I commision knit, and bridal shawls are so commonly on my list its almost commical. But yeah, a wraped style headcover is highly likely as well and i hadnt considered that OP might have been misusing the word \"shawl\"... if it was wrapped in any kind of traditional way it adds a kinda cringe factor for me that OP didnt recognize it as AT LEAST \"not a shawl\"", "I believe op recognized what it was, and tried to mislead readers. The second she said the bride put the shawl ON HER HEAD, i knew it was a hijab. Hijabs are usually smaller than SHAWLS (unless it is an elaborate wrapping style) and are not wrapped around the shoulders.", "Those are stunningly beautiful!", "Megan Markle,  Princess Kate, Tiffany Trump......", "How is a knee-length sleeveless dress not modest? Also, she wanted to honour her dead mother's wishes. How the f is that hypocritical?", "Ya'll can't read... Totally, in this case. The comment I replied to said never mock a bride for any reason. There's plenty of brides who choose awful things like not inviting a sibling because they're gay or have tattoos or are too pretty...", "You know theres better and kinder ways to express how you feel without saying something looks ridiculous on someone right? Especially when she obviously prefers that kind of dress", "She breaks a fundamental rule of her religion with this wedding but puts a veil over it for theatrics. That's how it's funny. Unless you're religious, then it's outrageous.", "that ten year age gap in your 40s is nothing really. The 25-33 difference between the salty daughter and the new wife looks a LOT closer from the 25 perspective.  I mean I'm dating like dad is in his early forties but the gf is finishing her Masters at 31, where her 47 year old sister calls me a cradle-robber even though she's a cashier and twice divorced with a clown car of kids.\n\nI TOTALLY can see how the daughter's age, plus the usual drama of whatever she's making drama over is par for the course when it comes to your dad being with someone new. Logic goes out the window in these cases. Hence this person went to Reddit to complain about someone else's clothing.  \n\n\nEDIT: read some of OPs responses and 100% she's the a-hole. Oh my god.", "Eh, my rule is \"he should not be her father's age\", from around 16 years of age difference, if they got to know each other after both parties were legally adults. Yes, I know this sub likes the divide by two add seven rule, but even that fits.\n\nShe's 33. Again going by everything this sub demands she is an adult both in legal and biological sense, so... OP, grow up, and learn to be less of an AH.", "Well there should be a little bumber in everyone's mouth to slow down a bit  before they just casually call someone's outfit choices or appearance ridiculous.", "You're joking right?  You think a 25 year old woman doesn't understand that calling someone's wedding dress \"ridiculous\" who you barely know just wasn't thinking?  I have a bridge to sell you.  Making a comment like that to your friends it completely different, not even close to the same thing.  They are not friends, OP said herself she doesn't know her all that well.", "Probably a language barrier thing, party means so many things and I think in this case was mistaken with celebration.", "Lol the\n\n>(this is important)\n\n\u2026erm. How exactly?", "Clearly OP has some unresolved feelings about this wedding and managed to take it out on the bride's choice of dress.", "The only ridiculous thing here is you and your personal beliefs on what a woman chooses to wear on her wedding day. YTA. Check yourself and your poor attitude!", "Sounds like you're being quite ridiculous over something that does not effect you in the slightest.", "So why won\u2019t you apologize now that you know?", "info: are you Erin or perhaps marrying Erin? Otherwise why do you care how much skin Erin is showing? Because I definitely wouldn\u2019t be giving this much shit about how much skin I\u2019ll be seeing on a woman.", "I can read, I am again reiterating that mocking is never ok regardless of the situation. Not sure why you don't get that there are better ways to approach a situation than mockery.", "You know other people can have opinions too, right?", "OP is implying that the bride is hypocritical by using different standards for her wedding dress than her everyday clothes. But \u2026 most people\u2019s wedding attire is WORLDS away from their everyday clothing.\n\nI also think OP is judging her for her religious beliefs and low key slutshaming her. Seriously\u2014a knee length, sleeveless summer dress is not modest enough??? In some cultures, sure. But most people hearing that description are thinking of a normal outfit. I\u2019m confident OP would have mentioned it if this dress was objectionable to her in some other way\u2014cutaway sides, mesh sections, pictures of nude women printed on the front\u2014so this is just OP being awful. (To be clear, a dress like that still wouldn\u2019t invite OP\u2019s judgment; I bring it up because more people might agree that a dress with those features might not be appropriate in certain public spaces.)\n\nOP, YTA.", "I dont understand why people are so judgemental of someone else's choice to be modest or more conservative? \nI'm not even particularly religiously motivated by my own choice to be fairly modest in my dress and public behaviour but it's led to criticism from other women who think I should of done things differently.", "My guess is she didn't since she had to post on aita after her dad called to tell her off.", "OP is probably not working with a highly inspired vocabulary. Her mental functioning doesn\u2019t seem too accomplished", ">  my dad and I were previously estranged for years\n\nI think she deeply resents her father. He is not a safe target, so she is taking it out on his bride, thinking because she is young, she'll just sit and take it. OP is in for a surprise, most Muslim women are used to defending their religion and are NOT encouraged to just sit and take it.", "Nice troll.", "They never are if they describe themselves as edgy."]}
