{"id": 817, "submission_id": "yj5hdg", "title": "AITA for hiding my pregnancy from most of my family until after I had given birth?", "selftext": "I gave birth to my son 18 weeks ago. My whole pregnancy was kept under wraps for the most part with the exception of my husband's parents and my sister. Husband's parents because our son is likely to be their first and only grandchild. My sister because she has always been my support person. The news of me having a baby did not go over well with my dad, his wife or my half sister. \n\nSo for people wondering why I kept it from them. There are two reasons. A few years ago I thought I was pregnant and had miscarried but the truth was more complicated. I had not been pregnant but had some undiagnosed issues that had made my periods always irregular. I had two positive tests at home test and an inconclusive test at the dr, which they figured could be me having a miscarriage, but an ultrasound had revealed nothing but did show up some other stuff and more tests were done and diagnosis followed. I had been open about the positive test and when the truth came out my dad's wife was smothering. She told me that was when a girl needed her mom the most and she would not let me push her away like I always had. She married my dad when my sister and I were young and our mom had died, so she saw herself as filling that mom role, but she was too pushy about it. Even after all I had been through she would not give me space when I asked for it and my husband had to make her leave our home.\n\nThe other reason is my sister has two kids. Through both pregnancy's our dad's wife tormented her with talk of how she'd need her, as her mom, she needed to be there for her baby as she was experiencing pregnancy and talked about how becoming a mom would bond her to her and make her appreciate her in a way she never had before. My sister actually grew to despise her because of it. Neither of us were ever big fans of hers but it really made her despise her because she was so sure she would fully replace our mom by being here for my sisters pregnancy. Even told our sister she was being dramatic when she said she missed mom and hadn't got the patience for her trying to force her way in. She said pregnancy makes women irrational and there's no reason to miss a ghost. My sister has not allowed our dad's wife to be known as grandma to her kids ever since. She had considered allowing it before the pregnancy stuff but after the chance was gone and my sister would not hear arguments for it.\n\nAll this led me to keep quiet when I did successfully get pregnant. I actually don't live super close to my dad anymore so I just stayed away. I also knew it would hurt their feelings but I honestly didn't have it in me to care. My dad was furious and his wife and my half sister still send me messages about how cruel and unfair I am and how I robbed them of the excitement and tainted the whole experience. They both said how dad's wife becoming a grandma for the third time was important, especially give her other grandkids will never call her grandma, and I was selfish to take joy from her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667299789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj5hdg/aita_for_hiding_my_pregnancy_from_most_of_my/", "score": 3031, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People should respect your right to privacy when you need them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way. I know times can be hard for you. However my pregnancy was about me getting my child into this world in as healthy of a way as possible.

She overstepped too many boundaries when I had my miscarriage along with overstepping too many of sister\u2019s boundaries. Please don\u2019t make me continue placing boundaries for our health.

NTA at all, good for you for taking care of yourself.", "NTA- your baby is a human being not an 'experience '", "NTA. \n\n**You made protecting yourself the priority, which was also protecting your child.**  That's your job now.  \n\n**You didn't take joy from her.  She hadn't earned it.**  That joy was never hers.  She spent her time making sure that she didn't deserve it, not that she did.  You didn't take her joy.  She did that to herself.  \n\n**Your child isn't someone else's possession, toy, or experience.**  They are wrong.  \n\nThat your father's wife is intrusive, pushy, obnoxious, and emotionally abusive is a whole pile of **very valid reasons to protect yourself** and your child from her and her behaviors.  \n\nThat this is a pattern of behavior from her for years, trying to find ways to fulfill her own fantasy at the expense of her husband's children, just means you have **even more valid reasons to protect yourself** and your child from her.  \n\nI'm a grandparent.  Grandparents aren't a priority to a child.  They are a bonus, if they are good ones that know how to behave in loving, kind, respectful ways.  One way a grandparent shows their love is by showing respect, to the child and the child's parents.  It's not hard, when you think about them.  So, for your father's wife, it's not likely to happen, because **she's thinking of herself and only herself here.**  She didn't picture the needs of a pregnant woman as an opportunity to help out and focus on your sister's needs, **she viewed it as a chance to make herself important by using your sister's vulnerability to take advantage**.  Typical abusive manipulation.\n\nShe also has your father and half sister trained to be **her enablers**, to put her feelings and wants first, over everyone and everything else.  So, **you can't trust their words** to be truths, only to be what she wants.   People that put their wants ahead of the needs of others, like your father's wife, will say things that are lies, to make you feel Fear, Guilt, or Obligation to do and say what they want.  Don't.  **Stand firm on your instincts and your decisions, and keep on protecting yourself and your child f**rom this person.  \n\nIF you *ever* decide to meet up, which you don't have to, as her behavior isn't improving and No Contact is also a reasonable decision,  make it someplace not your home, so you can walk away anytime and don't have to try to make her leave when she doesn't want to.  Also, public places mean lots of witnesses and sometimes, they behave better that way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
