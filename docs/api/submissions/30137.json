He sounds extremely selfish NTA", "NTA. Figure out how to hide it. It will be good practice if you have kids or kids visiting. My friend texted me the other day he locked himself in the bathroom and was eating a Snickers in the tub because it was the only safe space.

Maybe he was deprived as a child and is fixated on food?  Whatever his issue is, you still deserve to have some snacks that you bought for yourself.  \n\n Is it laziness?  Like is he likely to grab easy to eat food like snacks vs making a sandwich or cooking something? \n\nNTA if you have to go to the extreme of locking stuff up, then do it.

Get a lockable container, and hide it where he's unlikely to find it... and even if he can, he won't be able to open it.  If he complains, you can, very fairly, reply that this is the only solution that you're left with.  He seems determined to eat anything you want, so to be able to have anything nice for yourself, you need to protect it.  \n\nNTA", "Worst case scenario, this is a power move. My ex used to take my seat all the time. We'd be settled in the living room after dinner, I've got my needlework and tea on the table next to me, I get up to use the bathroom and come back to him sitting in my spot. So I'd sigh and move my stuff and settle in another chair, only for him to move to my new spot the next time I got up. Multiple times in one evening. \n\nIt seemed like a minor irritation at the time.

YOUR LIFE!!!", "My partner & I eat foods at a different pace & with different enthusiasm. \n\nFor those things, I either buy 2 & write our names on it (eg sliced ham - he has a small amount at a time & considers expiry dates a vague suggestion. I like half a pack per sandwich & strongly believe it magically goes bad exactly 3 days after opening, because that\u2019s what they write on the packet!). \n\nOr we have labelled snack boxes & stuff I buy with one of us in mind more than the other goes in there.\n\nHe gets free rein on All The Calories after his insanely long bike rides, so long as they come out of his snack box. \n\nWoe betide him if he touches mine though!\n\nThere\u2019s an upside to him being a human hoover though - when I get bored of a snack I previously enjoyed, I can move it to his snack box & it will disappear. Then I can buy myself something more appealing. \n\nHe cannot cope with shared snacks though - for some inexplicable reason he ALWAYS wants the crisps (\u201cchips\u201d in American) that are more my preference, rather than the ones I buy purely for him. \n\nIt\u2019s bemusing and \u201cjust about\u201d amusing, so I\u2019ve not changed the shared crisp-box system. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t make sense to me - why the FOMO on my flavours\u2026!?! :-)", "Ugh my abusive ex used to do this.

My father is similar to this. To this day no food is safe around him.

Yeah, don't let the door hit you on the way out.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't care if you replace it, I wanted it RIGHT THEN, I saved it for *that specific moment*, it was my small glimmer of light at the end of the dark, monotonous tunnel that is most daily life, and when I finally went to have it, it's just...

That is a VERY hard boundary for me. I would let it slide once, and communicate how deeply not okay it was. If it happens again, throw the whole man out.

It's so disrespectful.", "When she tried dividing the snack in half to share, he didn\u2019t wolf down the whole of his half and then maybe start eating her share out of lack of control to stop. He would pick and chomp and nibble on both halves, eating them both simultaneously, leaving parts of both halves uneaten but obviously not in a state to be enjoyed by OP. When she buys snacks he doesn\u2019t like, so he\u2019s not operating on desire for that particular food, he eats it anyway.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a compulsive desire to eat something he\u2019s not supposed to have in his diet, it\u2019s a power play to tell her that he can and will have her snack whenever he chooses.\n\nAnd it\u2019s got thin edge of the wedge vibes. He\u2019s starting taking her snacks all the time every time after they moved in together, he didn\u2019t take them when they didn\u2019t live together, he probably had access to her home and cupboards but he didn\u2019t take her snacks whenever he found them, he timed the introduction of behaviour for after they passed a relationship milestone. Then he calls her childish and petty and says it\u2019s a small issue, we\u2019ll if it\u2019s such a small issue why doesn\u2019t he concede? What\u2019s he going to escalate to at the next milestone?\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between a compulsive overeater who would feel bad about their actions and an abuser who\u2019s weaponised food consumption and tries to make his victim feel bad about getting upset by his actions. I\u2019m inclined to think he\u2019s the latter."]}
