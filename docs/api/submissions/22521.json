{"id": 22521, "submission_id": "152fzzg", "title": "AITA for not wanting a special ed student to be allowed back in my class?", "selftext": "My sophomore year I [20F] (16 at the time) was put into an acting class at my high school. The PAC was separated from the main building by an alley. One of the students in the class was Craig (not real name of course). I didn\u2019t know much about Craig. All I knew was that he got irritated easily and didn\u2019t fit in well socially. \n\nAt the time that this story happened, I was on crutches and couldn\u2019t walk on my own. Our teacher Ms. L started to do attendance and Craig was talking back when she asked him to be quiet as usual. This time however I was close enough to hear him mutter under his breath that Ms. L was a \u201cbitch\u201d and some other choice words. Now I can understand not liking a teacher and all but Ms. L was the sweetest, craziest woman ever and she also had cancer at the time.\n\nHearing him say this honestly pissed me off a bit and  I looked at him and just said \u201cShut up.\u201d He immediately got mad and began to mutter that I couldn\u2019t tell him what to do as Ms. L walked into her office. Suddenly he stood up and knocked his chair to the ground and flipped his table over. My crutches fell from their spot and I couldn\u2019t reach them.\n\nHe grabbed his chair and tossed it about ten feet which easily broke the plastic chair and then he turned his sights to me and flipped my table. By this time J booked it and B was next to me. He then grabbed one of my crutches and began to spin with the crutch held like a baseball bat in his hands. With perfect discus throwing form he spun the crutch just barely over my head as I ducked and threw it across the room at least 40-50 feet and hit the wall, leaving a mark about 10 feet up. Some of the guys were sitting up ready to protect me if needed.\n\nLuckily for me, Ms. L then stepped in and yelled at Craig to get out of her class. He ran out the side door into the alley and began to bang his head against the dumpster. Ms. L followed him into the main building and told him to go to the office. From what I heard Craig almost attacked Ms. L in the office but the VP stopped him.\n\nDuring that time, the class was comforting me and helping me get my crutches as we quietly talked and I hugged the guy who was getting ready to step in and protect me. Within about 30 minutes the VP came in to check on everyone and as he walked away everyone could see that Craig had ripped away his back pocket of his dress pants. \n\nWhen I told my close friends about this situation they informed me that Craig was in special ed classes. I had no idea but that didn\u2019t make me feel bad when he was suspended. A while after the incident, the VP that handled the situation came into class to basically ask if we would be okay with Craig returning to class. Now this may be selfish but I wish he would have talked to me alone to ask. Of course after everyone gave their approval as a group I felt like I would be a bad person if I were to prevent a special ed student from being in a class, so I said it was okay. I don\u2019t think Ms. L allowed him back after but AITA?", "created_utc": 1689632554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152fzzg/aita_for_not_wanting_a_special_ed_student_to_be/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s a danger to everyone in it.", "Eff that dude. Special Ed is a far cry from crazy and dangerous.  He may have needs outside of what traditional school can provide.", "NTA\n\nThis guy is dangerous. If he is attacking people, he needs more help than the average school can provide.", "They do this constantly to teachers, because they don\u2019t want to actually give students consequences.", "This was four years ago? Why are you asking now? Obviously the student was violent and shouldn't have been mainstreamed.", "Special ed kids are supposed to have access to something called a \u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d.  What is supposed to happen is they are supposed to be mainstreamed as much as possible. What it means in reality is that he will be placed in a regular classroom, and f you to everyone else in there.", "NTA- it seems like he had a nervous break. He needed serious help that the school was not providing, likely including a 1 on 1 individual program. If he snapped like that where he was a danger to others, he wasn't ready for the regular classroom. Your safety comes before getting to attend a theater class.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some SpEd kids should not be in mainstream schools. Period. The other students have a right to a safe school environment.", "NTA. He was not emotionally equipped for the class if he was getting outraged by a) a reasonable request from a teacher (to be quiet so class could start) and b) an understandable response from a fellow student when he continued to be disruptive but with bonus misogynistic bullshit. \n\nKids who have violent outbursts and attack multiple people in a class should lose the priviliege of attending that class for at least the remainder of the period their original cohort is in attendance (and it should be up to the teacher if he would be allowed back in the following year to re-take the class).\n\nIt may be that he needs a personal aide, or therapy to help him manage his outbursts, or an IEP that allows him to walk out of class and to the nurses office if he feels his emotions getting out of control, but just giving him a talking to and plopping him back into class after he got violent is not a decision to shove off on a bunch of kids who are being guilted about his special ed status.", "Dude needs to be in a straight jacket.
