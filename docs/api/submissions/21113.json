He gave you reasons why he think it wouldn't suit you. You're allowed to look how you want to look, and he's allowed to say that a certain look isn't attractive/doesn't fit you when you ask for his literal opinion.  Pulling the immediate hang up because you are running into an opinion you don't like is actually just childish and signals that you're not mature enough for a relationship. Genuinely curious about the ages involved. \n\nKind of related to some comments I'm seeing:  people are emphasizing that it's your body and you're allowed to do what you want, as if this isn't already clearly obvious. Your boyfriend could rock a pedostash, get a Mohawk and dye his hair green, or start rocking the dreadful man-bun and we all already know that it's his body and his choice. Duh. But surely one of those options to you is unattractive, and not exactly what/who you fell for or what you find attractive, no?  I know this sentiment kind of goes against the grain on reddit, but when I am with someone and I am attracted to them, I want to be attractive to them. And partners from my past have had similar views.  When we talk about our appearance, we ask for each others opinions, and then make our decisions based on that. I've had girls who grew their hair out longer because I prefer longer hair, and I've been told that no beard is a preference / \"poofy\" not freshly washed curly hair is a preference, and so I make my adjustments. I was asked by a girl if she should cut her hair and I told her she can do what she wants, and then after she cut it she learned about my long hair preference and felt silly for cutting it.  These are just my relationships, and others will vary, but sometimes people prefer looking and dressing a way that their partner most prefers and there's nothing wrong with that.", "Why are you asking if your the AH, when its your hair & your choice?
