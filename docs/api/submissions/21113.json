It's hair, if you don't like the cut you can grow it back. And more importantly it's your hair, I don't really want to get on a soapbox and start chanting 'your body, your choice' but the words do fit. \n\nIf you have a full head of hair, play around with it. Regrets are a tragedy and often unnecessary. That applies to hair and asshole boyfriends. Shut him down on this, give him a chance to get over himself and if he doesn't... it may be time to move on.\n\nNTA", "yta... he gave you his opinion, you asked for it. while it didnt look like a perfect example of tactfulness, it wasnt mean either.\n\n\nIts your head, do what you like!..nta for cuttting it.", "I mean if you asked YTA, I get it sucks when someone\u2019s opinion or thought on something doesn\u2019t line up with yours especially when it\u2019s something that changes your looks. If you want short hair do it but to be mad at him bc he said he doesn\u2019t like short hair and that it\u2019s a bad idea doesn\u2019t make him the AH. Tbh if I made a decision like that and my bf wasn\u2019t honest with me and I ended up hating it I\u2019d be mad bc when asking for someone\u2019s opinion you\u2019re basically asking if they think it would look good on you bc not everyone can rock EVERYTHING. Again if you wanna cut your hair do it. Opinions are like assholes and we all have them, and they all stink. Don\u2019t take it too much to heart because it\u2019s not that deep.", "INFO:  Why were you nervous about telling your boyfriend about cutting your hair?", "NTA - your hair and your body are your own. it\u2019s not his place!", "So let me get this straight, you made a decision regardless of outside input. You then go to your BF and ask his opinion. BF proceeds to give his opinion. You tell him that his opinion is irrelevant then again ask for his opinion. He gives his opinion that cutting your hair would be a mistake and you hang up because he had a different opinion??? \n\nSounds like a reason to break up to me /s\n\nYTA don't ask for opinions if you're going to react like that. Your BF is his own person separate from you with his own views and needs. He was honest and you threw it in his face. \n\nTry to accept that the world is not there to agree with but challenge you to be better then apologize to your BF because he did exactly what you asked and you shut down the conversation because of it.", "ESH. He doesn\u2019t get to dictate your hair (and honestly, I was closer to Y T A until I saw the stuff about how it would make your forehead look bigger, etc - got to love demeaning someone to manipulate them into doing what you want), but you asked for his input. Hanging up on him when it wasn\u2019t what you wanted to hear was honestly rude.", "YTA because you asked for his opinion.\n\nSounds like you only wanted a positive opinion.", "NTA.\n\nIf all he cares about your hair instead of you, which is how it sounds, then his opinion is invalid. Find someone who cares more about you and less about your appearance.", "Not to be TA myself, but there are plenty of people who definitely could\u2019ve used the big forehead tip before they cut their hair. Even so, fiveheads have the right to cut their hair however they want.", "YTA. You asked him. He answered. Don\u2019t be a sook because the answer isn\u2019t what you wanted.. you are the one who asked him.. Don\u2019t be a sook if he is being honest with you. Don\u2019t be a sook over a first world issue. Perhaps you want a liar as a partner instead?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he is that adamant about his gf having long hair, he is not the person you want to be with.  Please have a look back at your relationship and see whether there are any other red flags for control issues, because this man definitely sounds like he could be toxic.", "YTA \n\nbut not because of this stupid story about your hair, it\u2019s the fact that your bf isn\u2019t a real man.

But he should understand that he has no final say over your body.", "Attraction is complex, but you don't need to subject yourself to conversations all about how much someone won't like your theoretical choice regarding your own appearance. That's exhausting. NTA", "YTA do whatever you want but don't expect others, especially your significant other, to tell you what you want to hear.

I don't even understand why she asked. \n\nShe doesn't need his permission. But also, why is she getting angry over his opinion that she asked for.

He just doesn\u2019t want her to cut it. I personally don\u2019t believe it was anything other than a comment to sway her to what he wants. I totally agree that she was rude and an AH, I just think he wasn\u2019t much better in how he went about sharing his view. At the end of the day, the truth is that OP\u2019s BF may end the relationship over it - do I think that would be a lot? Yes.

You seem pretty damn sensitive tbh", "Oh yeah the BF was definitely being a dick about it lol.\n\nI'm just not a fan of people asking questions they don't really want the answer to.\n\nAnd, if he ends the relationship over a hair cut.....he didn't care that much to begin with.", "You literally wrote you wanted his input?", "Thanks!", "Oh yeah, agree on all."]}
