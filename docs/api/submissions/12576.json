I wouldn\u2019t have done this if I knew he wasn\u2019t cool with it btw, but we used to smoke weed a lot together before he had his kid so he\u2019s fine with drugs.\n\nThe dinner went fine, idrk what to say about it. But afterwards he asked if I was ok because he noticed that I was acting weird (I wasn\u2019t but maybe he just thought it because he was anxious because it was his birthday) , and I told him I did a few lines before I came and he completely freaked out on me. He told me that I can\u2019t do that anymore because he has a kid and a girlfriend and I\u2019m being a risk to him. He told me not to come back when I\u2019m high or he will tell his girlfriend (his girlfriend hates me, dk why)\n\nAITA? I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I knew he would freak out like this , and we have smoked weed together before and he knows that I do harder stuff and he didn\u2019t care .

Weed is different than coke. Weed is psychoactive but non-addictive. Cocaine is seriously addictive, harmful, and prone to result in multiple septoplasties and rhinoplasties. Take it from someone who needs one because their sinuses are now too eroded into the roof of their mouth to have decent breathing quality.\n2. That was before he had his son. This is after. Having a son changes your priorities. You're still young and in the invincibility stage (I was too), and so you're not realizing a lot of things you should be doing, only things you want to be doing (like cocaine).\n3. No one does coke just because they had a rough day at university if they aren't either dependent or addicted to it. I suggest you seek help from family members and a rehabilitation facility. I spent 16 years addicted and it was the worst time of my life. Continuing down this path will get you kicked out of school and your friends will all leave. You'll have no family. If you don't think this can happen to you, you are seriously unaware.\n4. If he noticed you were acting weird, you were acting weird. You don't get to decide who you are or how you act on cocaine. Others do. You're not in a coherent state of mind and drugs block introspection/stunt healthy awareness when taken. So likely, you were acting really freakin' weird and you likely always act really freakin' weird when you use. You just don't know it, which makes me think you're a very un-self aware addict at this stage, not just a recreational user, since cocaine is now causing problems in your life.\n5.
