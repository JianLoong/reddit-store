I have known since the beginning of time Lily is \u201cdating down\u201d. She is smarter, makes more money, is more attractive, and is funnier than I ever could be. I really don\u2019t care. She chose me and that makes me feel like a literal god. However, what I don\u2019t like is certain comments made by others.

It gets to a point where she just spends hours harping on me after I tell her to stop. It doesn\u2019t feel good to have someone pick you apart for hours when you\u2019re trying to relax. Last night we all went out for drinks and Maria started up once again with her comments.

Quite frankly I think you sound obnoxious.\u201d Maria went silent and Jake started accusing Lily of embarrassing Maria for no reason.

I have told Maria a lot I don\u2019t appreciate her jokes and she never stops so maybe hearing it from Lily will help. Jake said we were unbelievable and overly harsh towards Maria.

Your GF wasn\u2019t harsh or aggressive, she was just being honest and Maria didn\u2019t like what she heard. Does your friend not see this happen when it does? Do they just accept it every time?

Me and my partner have had the same bullshit from people, I do not understand why people think that putting my partner down in front of me is a complement? Like seeing him hurt is supposed to make me feel good? I usually just play dumb and embarass them by pretending I don't understand. It's funny to watch them tie themselves in knots when I keep saying sorry? What? What do you mean? If its someone i actually like I will pull them aside later and explain to them that I don't want to hear it and its not funny.\n\nI know he smiles through it but it hurts him a lot and just makes him feel shit which makes me feel shit too.
