We hide our edibles in the hall closet, which looking back now is stupid and irresponsible. We should\u2019ve hid them better, so this whole situation is our fault too. \n\nAnyways, last night we were gonna order food and I called for my son, he comes out obviously high but trying to hide it. We immediately question him and he gives in, telling us he found and took some. We take his phone and start to talk to him, when about halfway through the conversation, he slowly starts hyperventilating and freaking out. He tells us he took five gummies. Fucking five. \nI\u2019ve been in this position before and know it can be living hell, probably more so for him, as he\u2019s way smaller than us. \n\nMy wife and I make him lay down and tell him just to breathe. A few minutes later he\u2019s calling for us and is full on panicking now. My wife says he need to deal with it himself, that he won\u2019t die, and he\u2019ll be fine once he falls asleep. I\u2019m ashamed to admit, I agreed at first, but later on he was still awake and freaking out. It was hard on both of us to listen, so my wife started working on an art project and I tried to watch tv. \n\nI already felt horrible and was being eaten by guilt, so I went into his room and laid with him for a little bit. Once his breathing for somewhat under control, I held his hand and gave him back his phone to listen to music. Once he fully calmed down, I took his phone back, and put on his favorite movie. I stayed with him for a little bit longer, just in case he freaked out again. \n\nMy wife was a little upset with me, as we both agreed to let him go through it. I feel like that\u2019s not right though, it\u2019s terrifying going through that. I was alone the few times it\u2019s happened to me, so I didn\u2019t want the same thing for him. It could be traumatic. \n\nWe took his Xbox and tv out of his room this morning and he\u2019s not allowed to go out with friends. Though he\u2019s grounded, my wife Kees bringing up how she wishes I wouldn\u2019t have went in there. I just change the topic not wanting to start anything.

Hey kiddo, we have edibles in the house but they're only for mommy and me. Hey kiddo, I know weed and edibles are really popular right now but you're too young, don't do it.\n\nBecuause if not, WTH?? And even if you did, you don't leave a child who has never been high, much less that fricken high alone! He must have been terrified.", "Not sure how to judge this one. On one hand you guys are definitely assholes for leaving your edibles in a place where your minor child could find and access them. This was not a good parenting move and you really need to be more careful. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re assholes (mostly your wife) for basically leaving your 13-year old alone to wait out a massive panic attack. It\u2019s pretty common to have an anxiety attack when you consume too much THC, especially if you are not used to consuming it. Leaving him alone in his room and going off to work on an \u201cart project\u201d or whatever is pretty callous. You guys consume weed all the time so it didn\u2019t feel like a big deal, but I bet it felt like a big and terrifying ordeal for your kid. If I assume these gummies were 10 mg (lowballing the dose) then that\u2019s 50 mg total\u2014I\u2019m a daily stoner, and 50 mg at once would really mess me up. I can\u2019t imagine being 13 and trying to cope with that alone. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for going and being with your son to help him calm down. That was the correct parenting move here, and your wife is bonkers for being upset about it. You did the right thing when you realized your mistake, and that matters a lot. I bet your kid felt a lot safer with you there.", "Wow, I\u2019m upset that your wife was going to let your son go through that alone. Sure, he\u2019d have probably been fine in the end, but he\u2019s a child and he needed his parents. Well done for taking much better care of him than his mother wanted to, but hide the edibles MUCH better in future. NTA for helping him, but serious ball dropped for leaving drugs around.", "YTA. So you left edibles \"hidden\" in a place where your son can find them, he ate some (did he even know what they were), and now you're punishing *him* for the resulting bad experience?! Pretty sure that the hell of having eaten five edibles IS the punishment. I doubt he'll ever do that again. It might be worth it to have a discussion about edibles with him, and drugs in general. All that said, the yta is for the punishment, you are absolute NTA for taking care of him during the experience.", "I hope you also ground yourselves for being stupid, careless and irresponsible for leaving them where he could find them. His panic and experience was punishment enough .", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, keeping them *anywhere* a kid could get to is incredibly irresponsible. Secondly, sending him to his room alone is even worse. What if he'd had a bad reaction to the gummies? With both of you ignoring him, there's no telling what might have happened.", "\"a few minutes later he\u2019s calling for us and is full on panicking now. My wife says he need to deal with it himself, that he won\u2019t die, and he\u2019ll be fine once he falls asleep...It was hard on both of us to listen, so my wife started working on an art project and I tried to watch tv.\"\n\nwhat is wrong with you? YOU fucked up by not securing your kid-friendly drug candy from your kid. and then you just sit by while he suffers the consequences of YOUR actions?? as an experienced adult who consumes weed often, i still find edible overdoses terrifying. i cant imagine how scared he was, probably thinking he was going to die or be permanently brain damaged.\n\nyou somewhat redeemed yourself by wising up and acting like a parent but your wife needs 1000 mg in her next cup of coffee.", "Wait a minute. You didn't think your son being abandoned by his mom and you (at first) while having the severe physical reaction he did wasn't punishment enough that you needed to take away his XBox, et al, too? I can only imagine how scared he was. YTA", "NTA - but your wife sounds like one. Trust me, that kid went through hell and learned his lesson, you did the right thing.", "No, youre NTA for the way you handled the situation. It will likely make him more comfortable coming to you in times of need. You have already addressed that you recognize you didn't hide the edibles properly, the edibles being accessible is what you'd be an AH for in my opinion.\n\nYour wife wanting him to go through it on his own is insane, and then to keep bringing up how she wishes you didn't comfort him? WHY? Why does she think being paralyzed from fear and confusion due to a drug is a good lesson?", "UPDATE: We bought a lockbox/chest with key to hide them now. They\u2019ll be in our bedroom. I realize it\u2019s my fault fully, words cannot express how terrible I feel. I\u2019ve apologized profusely and ungrounded him. He and I had another talk about weed and alcohol. I promised he could always call me if he needs a ride. \n\nMy wife is still being harsh to him, and now me. I\u2019ll try to have a talk with her tonight, right now she won\u2019t listen. I decided to take my son to his favorite restaurant, just the two of us. I know that it won\u2019t make up for experience, but just wanted to do something. Im literally writing this as he\u2019s getting dressed.", "For helping him, NTA.  He's 13, what your wife wanted is neglect, straight up.  You were both already severely neglectful in letting this happen in the first place and to further be deliberately neglectful after is borderline abusive.\n\nSo you're still an AH for putting your son in your situation in the first place, but absolutely not an asshole for helping him through the results of your and your wife's fuck up.", "NTA - In my opinion your job as a parent is to parent and protect, doesn't seem like he understood the gravity of what he did and having him 'suffer' through seems a bit harsh to me.  I would have done the same thing, helped him through and then work out the consequences later.  I am not sure why your wife, his mom thought it would be a good idea to further traumatize him.  Maybe a conversation for you both to have after things have settled, this won't be the last silly thing your son does, so I would have a plan in place. (Experiencing talking here).", "NTA for the specific question. That can be SCARY and honestly, I\u2019m appalled that he was by himself for any of it. \n\nYou are an asshole because YOU f*ed up not keeping them locked up in your own room and then when your kid got into them (LIKE KIDS DO) you and your wife made him half sit through a bad trip by himself and then grounded him.", "NTA-- You were empathetic and realized the time to punish your child was later, not in the moment. I would try to find a way to explain it to your wife that you're sorry you backed out of your agreement, but you empathized with your son and felt he already learned the steep potential downside and felt you could punish him later. \n\nMake sure you have a conversation with him about why at this age it's not a good idea to do drugs/alcohol, and not just punish him for doing it.", "NTA\n\nBut your wife certainly is. Or just has no concept that, unlike smoking, you can get REALLY fucked up if you eat too many edibles. And - holy shit - he ate 5 adult doses.\n\nThe ONLY appropriate response is to help him get through it and punish him after he gets through it. \n\nThat said, unlike others here have said, I doubt it will be much of a deterrent to him smoking pot in a couple years, although he\u2019ll be more careful with edibles. It\u2019s like alcoholic parents telling their kids drinking is bad. Um, yeah, right.", "I\u2019m sorry, your wife wanted to leave him to deal with this alone, after he\u2019d been hyperventilating and panicking? That\u2019s so unbelievably cruel. He clearly had no idea what he was doing, your job as parents is to help him get through it and then educate him after the fact. I\u2019m glad you were there for your son, but I\u2019m disturbed that the two of you initially agreed to abandon him when he clearly needed you. I\u2019d take a long hard look at your parenting decisions tbh, it\u2019s worrying that this your reaction and that your wife still believes she was right", "NTA. My daughter (13, then 12) took some earlier this year (way more than she should for her size)\u2026. She was in biiiig trouble the next evening, but we let her be a little terrified all day up until then\u2026 Chores were done properly, with no arguments, etc\u2026. But the afternoon/evening before, I helped her through her anxiety attacks, cuddled with her, & assured her she\u2019d be ok once she slept. There\u2019s nothing wrong with showing compassion WHILE making sure they learn from their mistakes. My daughter confessed because she trusted me that I\u2019d help her without making her feel worse in the moment. She already felt bad from the natural consequences.", "NTA, your 13 year old minor son make a huge mistake, you knew what he was going to go through. As a parent it is your job to help your kids, exactly what you did. When the emergency was over you punished your son and I hope he really learned something from this experience.", "NTA - I've been on both sides of this: Having eaten a whole chocolate bar myself, while not knowing the mg. And seeing my SIL smoke too much and have a terrible experience. \n\nGoing through that is probably enough of a deterrent to never do it again tbh. But while he was in it, absolutely I think it's right to try to help him cope and make sure his reaction doesn't get worse.", "YTA for agreeing with your wife to abandon your son while he was suffering, and for grounding him on top of it. Was his agony not punishment enough? I\u2019m outraged as a parent to read this. What\u2019s more, you are hypocrites for indulging in substances without properly educating your children about them (for example, explaining what is a safe dose, and letting them know that at the right age they can try it for the first time with you in a safe setting if they so choose).\n\nPlease apologize to your son and unground him. Poor kid.", "For the question you asked, NTA. If he is high he\u2019s not in the right frame of mind to comprehend what\u2019s happening and will not understand what\u2019s going on punishment wise. All he knows is he\u2019s high and he\u2019s scared. He\u2019s in survival mode, not learning mode. Working with toddlers you learn you absolutely cannot punish them while they\u2019re having a tantrum, because they aren\u2019t learning anything. You have to guide them into calming down and lead them calmly through discipline. Discipline is supposed to be mostly a logical and reason based process, and with such heightened emotions it\u2019s not going to work. He needs to be 100% sober and calm before you dish out the consequences.", "NTA\n\nYou are 100% right. While your son hold some blame, you two as the adults hold more blame. Glad he's fine and you guys ended up punishing him... Hopefully he learned a lesson....  As long as you were keeping an eye on him physically and making sure he didn't have some sort of medical emergency, I'd say your only fuck up is not securing the weed better. I see this no differently than if your teen had stolen your booze, got drunk, and ended up getting sick.... Monitor the kid and let them learn a lesson. All that said, I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I read that he took 5 of them.\n\nPoor kid for sure found out the meaning of \"fuck around, find out\".", "Don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime.", "I don\u2019t know where to start! Leaving your child alone \u2018he won\u2019t die\u2019 says wifey - what if he\u2019d vomited and aspirated? (It\u2019s happened) I\u2019ve nursed kids who have had psychotic episodes after having weed. I\u2019m glad you stayed with him (eventually) but surely what he went through was punishment enough? I\u2019d be amazed if he repeated this anytime soon and your wife sounds fucking horrible. Never mind her being miffed that you went in there, you should be seriously looking at how she was so devoid of sympathy for her own child. Worrying!", "Nta. I am judging tf out of your wife, though. She's definitely the asshole. \n\nThe only thing he will learn from this is to hide it better next time.", "NTA, but you need to address his behavior.", "Kinda an asshole. Shouldn't punish him until after he comes down, but even then, I'd imagine the 5 edibles were punishment enough.", "ESH  and I\u2019m a stoner (for pain management and for fun).  \n\nYour wife is treating him like he\u2019s one of your friends who took too many against advice.  He\u2019s 13 he\u2019s a dope.  Frankly ignoring an adult on a bad trip is mean too.  Why the fuck were they somewhere accessible? The shit show that could have happened if one of his buddies was at the house and did it too. Also be prepared for a teacher or possibly CPS. If he tells a friend about what happened in school and a teacher hears they might be mandated to report.  \n\nAlso have a common sense drug talk with your kid.", "Jesus fucking christ why do you have children?!?!", "Holy lord, you and your wife are definitely TAs here, if this is even real.\n\nYou left them in a place that could be found by any child looking for Christmas presents or for any random thing they might be thinking.\n\nKid doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s up so takes an insane amount. I\u2019m assuming he has no experience with THC previously, or if he had it definitely wasn\u2019t, what, 500mg?\n\nAnd the worst part is that you say you\u2019ve been there too? So you were ok with him having panic attacks, overwhelming existential dread, and making it so that this torment lasts as long as it possibly could by taking away any means of escape available to him? Thats monstrous.\n\nI want you to really think about that time (or times) you were in his position. Had you already been high before? Were there people to help you? Did you have the means to try and distract yourself or aim your emotions? The answer is yes, and you wanted your son to sit in a blind and undeserved hell for an eternity. Because you know exactly how long that experience feels, right?\n\nMonsters. Absolute negligent hypocritical monsters.\n\nEdit: if you\u2019ve got guns, get rid of them right fucking now.", "YTA from start to finish. Including posting about it here in a trivial way. Your son could\u2019ve called 911 and had you explain to the responders what happened, that would\u2019ve been pretty interesting.", "YTA. Not for not punishing him immediately but for stashing drugs where your 13 year old kid (!!!!!) could easily access them. That's insanely irresponsible. I feel bad for the kid that he got his xbox taken and got grounded when like 99.9% of the blame should fall on you and your wife. Like what were you guys actually thinking?", "Holy crow I do not agree with all of the people here. \nHere\u2019s the things. Marijuana is a less harmful DRUG than alcohol. It\u2019s like telling someone to lock up all of their booze in the home. The kid knows not to touch it. This is a teachable moment. Just as kids will drink at parties they will also eat edibles. Tell him not to take so much next time(if he\u2019s with pals) and maybe hide yours better now, just as you would keep an eye on your booze in the house. \nImagine if ops son drank a bunch and had alcohol poisoning (way worse and life threatening)  you wouldn\u2019t just leave him. Op, you\u2019re awesome for taking care of your son. NTA \ud83d\udcaf. Kids have always, and will always steal their parents alcohol and weed. It\u2019s not like op has crack or cocaine in the home, calm down everyone. \nOp is not a bad dad. This happened to me about 17 years ago. My dad was very nice to me and made sure I wasn\u2019t scared or freaking out. Yes they told me that teen drinking and marijuana use is not good, and did better to hide theirs. Yes! It happens. Op is not the devil. Teenagers get into stuff that-they shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a very common mistake. Mom is a bit of the asshole because it\u2019s not nice to do to a kid that clearly has no experience. My mom was like that.\nNow that I\u2019m 30, I smoke weed with my dad at family gatherings. I know it only recently became legal so people look at it as \u201cdrugs\u201d just look at it as alcohol\u2019s WAY less harmful cousin.", "The only non-asshole is your son and the only responsible thing done here was you staying with him. You and your wife are irresponsible AF and I hope your son goes to his school counselor about this. Your wife's evil btw. He's 13.", "YTA keep your drugs locked up. Legit punishing him for the same shit you both do; that\u2019s effective and not hypocritical at all.", "NTA. your son was freaked out and needed you very much. you showed him that he doesn't have to be afraid of you and can come to you in any situation.", "NTA you did what you did to avoid scarring him", "NTA once you sat with him to calm him down.  He is a kid and  had no idea what they would do. YES, he shouldn't have eaten them but you ARE his parents and need to support his growth. Your wife sounds kinda cruel.  To be as high as he was and never having been high before must have been terrifying.", "NTA for going in his room trying to help him through it. Huge AH for the rest of it in my opinion. He is 13, doesn\u2019t have any experience. Isn\u2019t it obvious that he would try and eat them? And that he doesn\u2019t have a clue how much to take without overdosing? 13 year olds are stupid. And it\u2019s not like alcohol where you have to consume a large amount compared to weed. And you know that it was hell for him and your wife still wanted to leave him alone in his room? Not offering any help or comfort? What kind of parent does this? And now you take his Xbox and his TV? How does this help anything? Don\u2019t you think he learned his lesson that night? Sit down and talk to him about drugs and what one should and shouldn\u2019t do, what in your opinion is a \u201chealthy\u201d (= not leading to addiction) way is to consume them when he is old enough. This would be way more useful than this stupid \u201cI take your Xbox because I wasn\u2019t able to hide my weed from you\u201d stuff.", "NTA. Yes what he did was wrong and he learned that a very hard way. He won't remember his experience fondly, but he will remember you cared to be with him and helped him through it. That was not the right time or way to punish him, so your wife is TA. Good on you for realizing your son needed you and doing what you did.", "NTA. Many people don't realize how awful OD'ing on cannabis can be. Sure it won't kill you, but it can be pretty traumatic for an adult who doesn't expect it, let alone a CHILD. They should have been locked up. I think punishment in this kind of situation only leads to resentment. More than anything, it teaches a child to avoid punishment.", "You can get a box that locks for $20.  Or put a padlock on a drawer. Be safe and responsible. Also lock up medication. I hope you don't have an unsecured gun.", "NTA for comforting, should have done it the whole time tbh\u2026 I think it\u2019s terrifying that your wife thinks he should have been left alone during that, that is cruel\u2026 that situation is an emergency, can be scarring and traumatic\u2026", "NTA - he was in a fucked up headspace and nothing was going to be gained by trying to punish an intoxicated person", "YTA.  Any THC products need to be locked up when you have kids in your home. You lucked out that it was just your kid. What if he had friends over?  We bought a small locked box from Home Depot to avoid this.", "He's following your example! His punishment is the overdose. Then punishing for what you do! What do you think?", "YTA for not being there for him the whole time. Also for punishing him for your mistake. Having that stuff in the house signalises it's not that bad so him taking it after he found it (which he did because you irresponsibility stored it) was pretty natural for a child that age. You should give him his stuff back and apologize for failing him. Then you can have a conversation reflecting on what happened and why he shouldn't take drugs in such an irresponsible way.", "what if it was a gun? hide your shit", "YTA. You should be very ashamed of yourselves. Put them in a fucking lock box, asshole. I cannot believe you didn\u2019t already have them locked up with a fucking teenager in the house. And then you left him in his room alone to have a terrible time freaking out. I didn\u2019t even leave my 35 year old sister in law alone when she took too much.", "You're both YTA but atleast you went back to comfort your child.\n\n1 you're both AH for thinking his punishment should be to just go to his room and sleep it off.\nYou both left a child, going through a trip for the first time, ALONE AND PANICKING.\n\nThey're 13, you're both meant to be parents. Both meant to give a sh*t about your child's physical and emotional well being. And you both just went ehh too much effort to deal with my high child who's panicking and needs someone to comfort them. It's their own fault so they can deal with it.\n\nYou're both dicks. Your wife is a calloused human who I'm sorry to say but doesn't deserve to be a mother.\nYou, atleast regretted it and went back. But your initial response was the worst a parent could have.\n\nI often try to not be judgement or name call when reading posts on AITAH but here you both failed as parents for something you both would have done at their age as well. And you both reacted initially the worst way you could. And your wife is being upset that you didn't continue being cold and neglect your son further, and you haven't tried to fight her or challenge her behaviour to defend your son.....", "YTA. You left the edibles in an accessible place. Of course kids are going to want to try what all the people are raving about. You shouldn\u2019t have taken his stuff. His freak out was punishment enough.", "YTA. Why would you keep taking his phone and stuff away when he was having a bad experience? I just read that your GROUNDING HIM? You left that shit out it isn\u2019t his fault that y\u2019all were stupid. You left him by himself? Give him his shit back.

THATS THE ONLY GOOD THING YOU DID THIS WHOLE STORY.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "YTA, you keept Drugs (yes, weed is still a drug) in a house with a teenager. Teenagers are prone to trying the things, their parents are doing. And your wife is a even bigger A-hole for leaving your son alone in that situation. What do you think, how he feels right now about that. And then you punish him for doing, what you are doing?", "YTA.  You completely mishandled this incident.  The cause was your failure to adequately store the edibles.  They should have been in a lock box.  Next, you left a freaking out child on his own, knowing that a bad trip must be supervised.  Last, but definitely not least, you punished him for being a normal child, when you are the cause of this mess.", "NTA for that question but the fact that you are questioning whether it\u2019s ok that you tried to help/calm your son when he was likely experiencing the most panic he ever has - it says a lot about your relationship and your wife imo. Good luck with that", "Yikes! I live in Canada where cannabis is legal. We have edibles in our house and we have talked to our kids about them. They are clearly marked and they know not to eat them, they know they are drugs. YTA for not talking to your kids about them and what could happen if he ate them. YTA for ever considering letting him ride it out on his own. I have seen grown adults who aren\u2019t used to edibles get incredibly fucked up on one gummy and you were going to leave him alone after eating 5!  How incredibly irresponsible you and your wife are. Truthfully I wouldn\u2019t even punish him. He got a hell of a lesson already going through it and how was he supposed to know what the hell he was eating when the adults in his house didn\u2019t tell him?", "YTA and your wife is a far bigger asshole. This is 100% a parenting fail. You shouldn\u2019t have punished him at all. You should figure out how to punish yourselves for keeping CANDY EDIBLES where a child had access to them. They were damn gummies. You understand the strength of one gummy. He\u2019s a kid. What kid would think eating one gummy is enough? You both should have been by his side, apologizing to him. Yes, he did something wrong. He knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to do it. He had no idea of the consequences of his actions and, in the moment, was absolutely terrified. He wasn\u2019t able to be reasonable about what was happening and had nothing to compare it to. Just a massive parenting fail all around. My god. Lock your shit up.", "YTA for leaving them in such a stupid place where he could so easily access them.\nYour wife is TA for leaving him alone to deal with what was  quite terrifying for a child\u2026.\nAnd again YTA for punishing him for a situation that could have been easily avoided if you and your wife were responsible adults who kept things like this away from children, or even discussed with  him repercussions of taking them beforehand\nYou most definitely are NOT TA for comforting your child though", "YTA How the hell is it your sons fault for eating gummy bears that he found. not judging that you do drugs. but why the hell buy them as gummy's. what punishment are you going to give yourself and your wife for being so stupid as to bring them in the house, but then let your Son nearly O/D on them, without seeking medical advice. Why did you think it a good thing to let him go through it . god some people make me so angry", "YTA, but not for that reason.\n\nThe kid is 13. You already admitted it was your fault for not hiding them better. You already admitted that you knew he was in for hell, and was panicking.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a situation where you should ignore him to serve him a lesson ffs.

We hide our edibles in the hall closet, which looking back now is stupid and irresponsible. We should\u2019ve hid them better, so this whole situation is our fault too. \n\nAnyways, last night we were gonna order food and I called for my son, he comes out obviously high but trying to hide it. We immediately question him and he gives in, telling us he found and took some. We take his phone and start to talk to him, when about halfway through the conversation, he slowly starts hyperventilating and freaking out. He tells us he took five gummies. Fucking five. \nI\u2019ve been in this position before and know it can be living hell, probably more so for him, as he\u2019s way smaller than us. \n\nMy wife and I make him lay down and tell him just to breathe. A few minutes later he\u2019s calling for us and is full on panicking now. My wife says he need to deal with it himself, that he won\u2019t die, and he\u2019ll be fine once he falls asleep. I\u2019m ashamed to admit, I agreed at first, but later on he was still awake and freaking out. It was hard on both of us to listen, so my wife started working on an art project and I tried to watch tv. \n\nI already felt horrible and was being eaten by guilt, so I went into his room and laid with him for a little bit. Once his breathing for somewhat under control, I held his hand and gave him back his phone to listen to music. Once he fully calmed down, I took his phone back, and put on his favorite movie. I stayed with him for a little bit longer, just in case he freaked out again. \n\nMy wife was a little upset with me, as we both agreed to let him go through it. I feel like that\u2019s not right though, it\u2019s terrifying going through that. I was alone the few times it\u2019s happened to me, so I didn\u2019t want the same thing for him. It could be traumatic. \n\nWe took his Xbox and tv out of his room this morning and he\u2019s not allowed to go out with friends. Though he\u2019s grounded, my wife Kees bringing up how she wishes I wouldn\u2019t have went in there. I just change the topic not wanting to start anything.

But really, just like with alcohol, you should have shown your kid what you had in the house, explained to him exactly what the effects were, what happens if you take too much and that he is not old enough to partake yet. Hopefully he learned his lesson. I remember when I went out with friends at like 16 and drank too much.

He\u2019s not the first teenager looking to experiment. Would you leave your liquor up for grabs? \n\nSecond, I think this hit me hard because I made a similar fuck up your kid did last night. I bought (legal) delta 9 gummies last night hoping they\u2019d help me sleep. I took a second one after not giving the first one enough time to work and it fucked me up. For a solid hour my heart rate was in the one 150s. I was thankful my boyfriend was there and kept me company. I was so convinced something awful was going to happen I asked him if he knew CPR and cleared out the coffee table because I was convinced my heart was going to stop. I\u2019m an adult.

Good work for managing the immediate and longer term.", "I had a panic disorder as a teenager and a horrible drug experience caused flashbacks, PTSD, an inability to sleep, and eventually full on hallucinations in the middle of the day at school, dead sober. I was too scared to tell my parents anything, and their punitive attitude toward me alienated me from them completely. I was seriously messed up and in need of help and terrified to ask for or seek it. Eventually, disabling panic attacks got me sent to a shrink, who I also didn't tell about my drug use because my fear was so intense. I was put on many psychiatric drugs, then, one addictive (and no one informed me of that fact. Hooray!).  \n\n\nI just want to say, as someone much older, having survived that and many other things: bless you. I feel like your wife needs some counseling or a reality check if this is a real post. A punitive attitude on someone you love who is in crisis is never the right thing to do. I understand being alarmed as a parent and displaying harmful attitudes unintentionally, but honestly, ignoring your son and letting him go through something like that alone is extremely cruel and I struggle to understand what he would be meant to get out of that.   \n\n\nAgain, bless you. Keep on connecting with your son. It will make a huge difference in how he sees relationships, other people, and the world.", "I agree with YTA for having edibles in the house.

That\u2019s just neglect.  The consequences/ punishment and other interventions required to address his drug use can start when he is no longer high.", "Lol I wouldn't even leave an adult friend alone if they were freaking out on 5 edibles & you left your 13 year old son (without a phone or distraction) and went to watch TV.

I began an anxiety group therapy course and in my individual assessment they just told me get off weed and they haven't decided if my increased anxiety developed from the weed or other experiences that make me at risk (family, work, social, genetic).

If were going to compare this to alcohol as Ive seen some others do, if your parents ever found you really ill from drinking I would hope they wouldn't leave you there alone to suffer the consequences (definitely not at 13). You are his support, the people he is supposed to look up to and come to in a time of need. You never want to show your child that you aren't a figure of support in a time of need, children need you!

Everyone freaking out in the comments is absolutely ridiculous. The kid found edibles.

I\u2019ve never experienced a worse panic attack than when I was high and couldn\u2019t get out of it.\n\nThe rest of the situation falls to the wayside when you know how scary the situation is.

So I guess what I\u2019m saying is sure the kid made a mistake but we don\u2019t know what the circumstances where like and also, kids will be kids, they will try shit out.", "Again if this kid had stolen his parents keys would you still be complaining. If he\u2019s old enough to know he can\u2019t drive a car, he\u2019s old enough to understand not to do drugs that he isn\u2019t legally old enough to have. Yes, kids do stupid stuff, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t get held accountable for doing said stupid stuff. If this kid went for a joy ride he\u2019d have suffered legal consequences. His age would be taken into consideration in those consequences but there would still be consequences.", "They actually generally didn't and they certainly didn't have anything accessible that could get you completely plastered off your ass in one mouthful.", "dawg he tried watching tv to try and not think about his kid suffering and crying for help \ud83d\ude2d", "His wife has literally no empathy at all", ">(which a kid would see as fun candy)\n\nThen why say this?", "I don't like to assume lol, kids can be very resourceful when it comes to stealing things from their parents. \n\nI'm friends with a family that's all very 420 friendly, they love telling stories about how when we were all in highschool they'd hide their weed in the most creative places possible, and their kids would find it every. Single. Time. \"WE WERE HIDING IT IN THE WALLS AND SHIT\" \n\nWe were so much older than 13 though, not a huge deal. We had a safe place to get high and chill out.", "Yep, I agree with you! Thats why I think alcohol is not comparable. And if you have alcohol in the house that you can just drink like juice and you could potentially drink a lot before feeling an effect, imo youd be at least partly to blame if your kid gets intoxicated by it. 13 is still pretty young. Yes, you know right from wrong mostly, but you are still so young that you dont really understand the consequences of taking 5 gummies.", "Damn are you like this around everyone", "unless they\u2019ve had gummies before no they wouldn\u2019t, even if a friend had told them the effects I wouldn\u2019t consider them a reliable source. 13 year olds exaggerate and make things up", "It\u2019s a somewhat common thing that happens though.", "Ok, like I said, most people are assholes according to that criteria. Because most people don\u2019t lock away their alcohol from their kids.", "Jack Daniels premixed coke flavors taste exactly like coke.\n\nGot to try them last new years, got two six packs of them, I drank nearly an entire six pack all on my own.\n\nGot so buzzed I blacked out at some point and didn\u2019t even remember it.\n\nI was lucky to do so on my parents home and not at some random party, but yeah, definitely disagree on kids being able to recognize differences in alcohol especially when many bottles look like good old fashioned cream soda or regular soda bottles.", "Sour apple \ud83d\udcaf", "I can\u2019t be expected to have the same conversation with 5 of you at once.  Just go read the rest of this thread please.", "there absolutely should be consequences, I'm not saying there shouldn't be, but leaving your 13 year old who's greening out alone as a punishment is just cruel. he's 13, I seriously doubt he understood the full effects of edibles before he took them, if he did he wouldn't have taken 5.", "In one scenario, the kid snuck some literal CANDY. In the other he\u2019s stealing a car. Come on.", "So now you\u2019re backpedaling and changing your argument to \u201cone mouthful\u201d.  Got it.  So you know you\u2019re wrong and you know the vast majority do have beer in their fridge, because getting an entirely separate one with a lock is nonsense.", "Because it is fun candy, it\u2019s candy that gives you a high. Who wouldn\u2019t want to eat a fruit snack that makes you feel all floaty?", "Nope, just stupid judgement people. Saying he puts stuff on a higher shelf in a discussion about a 13 year old! He\u2019ll never figure a work around for that! Next level shit right there", "I don\u2019t think you replied to the correct comment", "You are literally blaming the parents for engaging in something that is perfectly legal for them to do. And saying they normalised it. No they are adults in a place where weed is legal if kids can understand that mom and dad can drive but they can\u2019t then they are old enough to understand that Mom and Dad can use weed and they can\u2019t. I agree they shouldn\u2019t have left him alone, but no the kid did this to himself. My parents kept liquor in the house. When I drank it and got a hangover that was my issue. I didn\u2019t whine that my parents normalised drinking because they had alcohol occasionally.", "I'm not backpedaling anything.  The ease of which the kid could consume too much has literally been the crux of my argument from the start if you look at my other post.  It might not have been on this specific thread though.", "I might\u2019ve misunderstood your original. I assumed you were saying \u201csome children would know what gummies do\u201d,,, you were probably talking about whether it\u2019s enough of a punishment or not \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "believe what you want, it's weird to let your kid green out as punishment", "And yet, children have ease of access to alcohol.  They have for basically as long as it\u2019s existed.  You know that.  Your only counter is \u201cwell mine didn\u2019t\u201d which you also know is weak af.", "Yes, that\u2019s right.  I\u2019m talking about punishment and consequences.  You don\u2019t know what being drunk is like before you steal your parents liquor, either.  That doesn\u2019t suddenly make it okay.", "They aren\u2019t \u201cletting\u201d him green out and I said I agree that they shouldn\u2019t have left him alone. I just don\u2019t think your ridiculous rant about them normalising it has any merit.", "No the counter is that having the ability to get completely trashed with a few gummies is hugely different than comparing to alcohol at all.  It's completely different things.  If it had been some joints I'd be on board with your argument.\n\nSaying my parents didn't was a response to your question, not the argument I was making.  I eluded to that with pointing out the difference in what was accessible."]}
