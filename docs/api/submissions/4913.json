I am given \"underperforming\" members of the team to supervise in order to improve their work.  Of all those I have supervised I've only rated 1 as being unable to improve sufficiently to do the job.  For the majority, the key is simply to give useful feedback on the work you have supervised. This means not only track-changed amendments so they can see what you have changed, but going through the amendments one by one to explain WHY you made the change.  If people understand WHY, they will not make the same mistake again.  I don't judge the first mistake - I only start judging if they make the same mistake after I have been through it thoroughly and explained WHY.  If not their failing is my error as their teacher - they did not know better. Even then, it's about support and encouragement.  The more nervous you make someone, the more anxiety is going to make them f up.  It sets them up to fail.\n\n\"I DOn't hAve tHe TiMe\"  Trust me, any decent supervisor has learnt that it takes more time in the long run to keep correcting work, then it does to give the necessary,  but lengthy feedback the first time.  It's called a learning curve.  \n\nI'm afraid all your post has done has exposed how naive you are about training new starters.  You are only 3-4 years in.  This is nothing.  You have a lot of learning ahead of you.  I hope your boss is understanding and gives you the chance to improve when (if you dont change) you inevitably face accusations  of bullying and micromanagement.\n\nAlso, talking about this employee with colleagues trying to create some sort of \"let's get her fired\" is disgusting behaviour.  If you have concerns they should be addressed to her manager, in private, only.  I suspect/hope your malicious behaviour is doing more to damage your reputation as a manager in the eyes of others than that of your victim.\n\nThis is work place bullying plain and simple.

You keep saying 1-2 people really like her. Do you bother to ask why?\n\nI have trained three people since 2019, straight out of college (& I've trained many others but not new grads).\n\nOf the three, two have advanced on to other positions in the org. One to become an Executive Assistant and one is a Project Coordinator.  I would never conflate the two. One I'd trust more to handle large events, logistics, and operations. The other is so much stronger in writing original content and editing. \n\nOne definitely took more time to learn the job. They were never \"speedy\" but they did the job well if left at their chosen pace. The other needed more one on one. They asked so many questions that seemed silly at the time.  But they needed frequent reassurances.\n\nBoth had unique needs and as a manager, giving them training and development means I need to know how they work in order to maximize their learning. My bosses are quite pleased in how they have turned out and I'd like to think I had a hand in their growth and success. \n\nDo I have a preference of the three? Yes. But doesn't change how I treat any of them. I give them the same opportunities and training. The job is the same.\n\nLook...Carla's not working out for you. That's fine.

This kinda hit home for me since I've done similar post-meeting corrections. \n\nI'm someone who regularly leads and takes minutes for scientific research meetings. And I've trained numerous others to do the same. I primarily work with bioengineers without the science training myself, so initially had to hustle and learn content and understand the lingo to even take decent notes. \n\nIf OP was redoing notes without a transcript, they are replicating them via presentation materials. And this means they're not only editing to remove extraneous info and highlighting action items. They are also adding missing technical detail or correcting them. That's a lot of time. For a 2-hour meeting, maybe 2 to 4 hours of \"redo\". It's horrible. (Going through slides and scientific documents just to parse out one critical line of what was said/decided upon.) I lose half my day.\n\nBut I digress.  If the notes were as bad as OP says, then they should step up and train.\n\nIn my work, it takes a newbie an average of 2 months worth of weekly meetings to get base-level competent. I typically take notes simultaneously during the training period, so there's no need for me to waste an additional 2+ hours as OP did, post-meeting.\n\nThen my notes serve as study material. I do review sessions to make sure any nuances are hammered home. Then if they deliver competent notes for about 2 or 3 meetings, I allow them to do so independently.", "INFO: what is her actual job title?", "Still sounds more like a high school class than a job that requires a college degree.", "How else is she supposed to learn?
