DON'T DO IT!\n\nChances are that once you move in you will constantly be reminded of the low rent and what she gives up to accomodate you. You are better off keeping your freedom.", "NTA\n\nIf the basement is a separate, self-contained apartment she can rent it to some other people. That way she'll get a money, but she won't be able to interfere in their lives, because they won't be family.", "NTA. If she's an unpleasant person, people aren't going to want to live with her. Those are natural consequences. You're under no obligation to bail her out of her financial situation. If she wants to rent her basement for under market, I'm sure she can find a suitable tenant.", "NTA. She needs to come to terms that a divorce comes with changes to both parties and she should probably sell the house to be better off in general. If she can\u2019t afford it she can\u2019t afford it and that\u2019s the bottom line.", "NTA - Her house isn't *your* responsibility, and it's absurd for her to accuse you of being selfish after presenting you with a *choice*. A choice implies that you're allowed to decide whichever you want. No, she presented you with a demand *disguised* as a choice, and now she's upset that you would dare defy her.\n\nYou just got a preview of what it would be like living with this woman. Do you really want more of that?", "NTA. It\u2019s a shame she can\u2019t afford it, but at the same time you have the right to accept or decline her offer and you declined, she shouldn\u2019t get upset and by the way you say you don\u2019t think she will respect you and can\u2019t stand her negative comments to kinda shows how she treated you in the past (sorry if I\u2019m making assumptions) I wouldn\u2019t want to live with someone like that.", "NTA. It sounds like a sweetened trap & the circumstances will change once you are under her roof. You are an adult & have your own life. Your mom shouldn't have assumed that you'd take this deal. And that's on her. Not you.\n\n\"we don't believe she will treat us with respect. We have been independent for a while and don't want to deal with her negative comments and honestly personality in general.\"                             \nThe above comment is all that you need to remember.", "NTA.  She can rent the basement out to someone else for more than she was going to charge you.", "NTA\n\nAs someone else said \"It's a trap.\" She may not even know that she is laying one, but as soon as you get there it will be \"my house, my rules.\" \n\nIf you still want to help, offer to help her find a tenant or friend to help out. She could charge near market value for the place and you don't have to deal with the possibility of your mother butting in where she doesn't belong.", "NTA.\n\nYou're an adult and you decide where and how you live.", "If she is not treating you with respect and as an adult now, it won't get better when she becomes your landlord. I suggest writing a letter as to why you don't want to move into the basement,so she can't just claim that you are being a jerk. Part of becoming an adult is no longer seeking the approval of one's parents.", "NTA. You have no obligation to do this to make things easier for her, and frankly any savings you'd make on rent would not be worth the drain on your energy that living with her would be.", "NTA! Don't move in with her unless you plan on living with her for the rest of your life. If she can't afford it, she needs to sell and find a place within her means.", "NTA.  It's not even remotely your problem if she can't afford the house, especially since selling it and downsizing is almost certainly an option.  BTW, I'm 100% with you.  At your age there is very little that could have convinced me to move back home.", "NTA- she should sell the house and move in next door! Nah jk. Where you live and spend your time is a very important decision. Sharing common areas with your mom is not really ideal. She built up expectations and it's not your fault. If you had to save money or where trying to get back on your feet- then of course", "NTA. If your relationship with your mother isn't 100% healthy, living with her is a recipe for disaster.", "NTA. If your mom can't afford to keep the home, she can sell it and downsize to something she can afford.  Once you move in, it's going to be difficult to move out of your situation.  Don't let her guilt trip you. You're an adult and you already know what to expect if you move in with her.", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable that your mom might be upset that you\u2019ve decided not to live with her - but you need to do what\u2019s best for you and your family.

There is NOTHING selfish here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: It is not about the money .. if it were about the money, she could rent to someone else.

A lot of parents would complain about their adult children coming back to live with them rather than taking care of themselves. NTA", "NTA. You're an adult and wouldn't rent from her forever but she'd need help with payments", "She can sell the house then or find a tenant. Like none of this is your problems, NTA", "NTA. She'll come downstairs to your place pretty much every day. She'll know when you go out and what time you get back. If you have friends over she might get upset or insist on being included. This might not happen, but considering what you said about her lack of respect for your independence, all these things probably will happen. Low rent is not worth that.", "NTA. Why did she get the house if she couldn't afford it?", "At your age there is very little that could have convinced me to move back home.", "heck, she can rent out every extra bedroom in the house. the difference will just be that it won't be to her child. it'll be to someone who expects to be treated like a renter.", "NTA and that's what I was going to say.

You moving into the basement would only be a temporary fix anyway unless you're planning on spending your lives there", "Exactly.

It is not your obligation to make sure  your mother can stay in her house.  She can rent to others to meet her bills.", "NTA. Home ownership is expensive.

My MIL initiated the divorce and moved into a 1BDR apartment. The divorce messed with SIL's mental health. She transferred to a college closer to home and moved back in with FIL. When they finalized the divorce, split assets, and both bought new homes, my MIL just assumed that my SIL would be moving in with her. She bought a bigger house than FIL with a nicer room for SIL, and the house was closer to SIL's college. But she didn't actually ask SIL. This is one of the reasons SIL did not feel bad choosing to live with FIL. Because MIL never respected her choices as an adult and still struggles to do so almost 10 years later. Your autonomy is worth the extra rent money.", "NTA Why can't she sell the house and find ne something she can afford.", "NTA.  Nothing selfish about taking care of your own needs and not putting yourself in a position to deal with her mistreatment.", "NTA.  I had to move back in with my dad when I was about your age and was relocating from one state to another.   I had a full-time job waiting, so was out of the house all day during the week.  At the end of the second week, I went out for a drink with my new coworkers and got home about 90 minutes later than usual.  Dad went nuts about where I was and what was I doing and why didn't I call.  Then he started in about being inconsiderate and not following common courtesy, etc.   I had a new place a week later.  Nope, once you get accustomed to answering only to yourself, living with a parent again without very clear boundaries that they will respect is just asking for trouble.", "NTA-tell her to rent out to people at market rent.

Seems like your mum can't afford the house by herself. Which means she's free to sell it and move to a place she can afford. Or get a (better) job. That's just life. Trying to guilt her own child into paying for her is not. Owning your own property is a privilege, mayhaps she needs to be reminded of that.", "Absolutely.
