They obviously have some issues but for her to disrespect you in your own home like that while you were offering a kind gesture of food to her husband would mean she\u2019s no longer welcome until an apology was issued, at least if it were me.", "NTA \nI think the best friend and his wife have some issues this wasn\u2019t about you there\u2019s something else going on there. All you did was offer food", "NTA. He's having trouble standing up? Anyone would have offered food in your situation. Drinking and not eating can lead to a very disastrous night. She put hands on you? I definitely would talk to your husband once sober. Because no one is in their right mind drunk or hungover. But your husband needs to talk to his friend and tell him that his wife was so out of line for putting hands on you when you were doing the right thing and making sure people were safe. If she was in fact taking care of her husband, she should know he needed to have some food in his stomach. \n\nAnd I agree with one of the other statements, she needs to issue an apology before being allowed back into your home.", "NTA\n\nThe wife seems deeply insecure. Not your fault.  Maybe hubby has strayed before.", "NTA.

Seems more like a culture thing. For me it's expected to feed your guests. If you don't, it's considered rude. But I've seen other cultures where you don't talk to another woman's husband, let alone give him a piece of food........or it's possible she's just crazy jealous.
