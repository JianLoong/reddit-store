Period. It's her money.\n\nYou decide what you do with your company, including who has a stake. It's your company. The minute you start giving out pieces of your company because others are jealous is the minute you lose control of the company. You might as well shut it down. Investors and people who have a stake in the company must be carefully vetted. It's easy to throw around shares. Very, very difficult to claw them back.\n\nYour brothers deciding to go out of state?

It was never your brothers money.\n\nThat said...\n\nI'm not so sure about Grandma here. She gave your brothers somewhere around $120k each? Which is super generous, but she gave you $350k? I get that most of us would be exstatic if grandma gave us over $100k, but I can also see why they'd be upset.\n\nI dunno...you seem to be pretty ok with getting triple what your brothers did.

Furthermore, I'm sure the stakes would be coming out of your percentage of the company, lowering your power and giving them unneeded sway as they could sell it to a competitor or something. Also one of them has offered to help, but are their services even worth the stake in the company when you could just hire someone with probably more expertise and will give you less grief in the long run? Wouldn't this just be you giving them a free job?

You need to be able to demonstrate soft skills better than your technical skills, as your degree says you have technical ability. Join DECA, debating clubs, learn something outside of what is taught at school to demonstrate you can learn something else independently. Most of all be able to speak about what you did and communicate what your contributions are - this is embarrassing but an essential skill. Hardest part is getting past an interview.
