While you are very fond of her and look forward to being her daughter-in-law, she is not your parental figure. Your sister stepped in to fill that role and she is the one who will be walking you down the aisle. your future mother-in-law may have always wished to have had a daughter. But she didn't. She had a son and she needs to be content with watching her son get married. You always wished your mom would be with you on your wedding day, but she can't be. FMIL putting her emotional needs on to you, especially in the context of your mother having died, is not appropriate and it is not a loving or kind gesture.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to take your side on this. Why can\u2019t FMIL walk her son down the aisle? I know it isn\u2019t traditional for the groom to be walked down the aisle, but people do it.", "NTA. It's your decision completely. Not hers. Not her wedding. Not her daughter.", "No, let your fianc\u00e9e stay out of it and tell his mom no. I don't think she is the asshole either and it's nice she thinks of you that way. Maybe have some kind of symbolic thing at the reception that is like her taking you on as a daughter. It's your wedding. You want your sister to walk you down the aisle, and for a really beautiful reason. Maybe try to come up with a way to recognize his mom in another way. I'm not saying this makes her have a good reason but it's her only son. Those kinds of relationships can be difficult to understand. I wonder if they have a song that they would listen to a lot. Maybe incorporated something that was special to them by bringing you into it. Maybe even your sister too if they get along. You both have one other person that loves you and will support you. You're family. It's nice you all love each other.", "You\u2019ve been with your fiance 8 years. Your mum died 6 years ago. So you\u2019d already known your FMIL for 2 years by then. If she\u2019s such a parental figure, why didn\u2019t she take you in? \n\nYour sister is your closest relative so it\u2019s natural she would walk you.\n\nBut if FMIL wants to be crazy about this, I\u2019d turn the crazy back on her. \u201cWhat is wrong with your sister? How dare she think your sister isn\u2019t good enough to walk you? It\u2019s so insulting to your family, etc etc\u201d\n\nI would seriously be questioning whether your fiance is mature enough for marriage though if he can\u2019t even stand up to his mum for you.", "You and your fiancee are both somewhat young, but he's old enough to start working on his spine. \nIt may be her dream, but this is your day. Your fiance needs to step up and make his mother behave. Otherwise he is not ready for marriage and he'll  keep struggling to be a good partner if his way of dealing with Conflict is to pretend it isn't happening.", "NTA\n\nIts your wedding and its your choice who walks you down the aisle and it is entirely expected that you'll ask someone who has been important throughout your life. While it sounds like you've known your FMIL for quite a while and its nice of her to offer, this is ultimately your choice and she should respect. I'm going to just put something out there, though: why doesn't she walk your fiance down the aisle? I know that's not the most traditional, but neither is a mother figure walking the bride. At my wedding, my wife and I walked together. There are lots of things you can do at a wedding and there is no reason you can't create a moment for your FMIL, but she can't demand a moment that's yours to plan.", "NTA. Possible alternative, could FMIL walk her son down the isle instead?\n\nAlso:\n\n>My fianc\u00e8 wants to stay out of it but feels like he is stuck in the middle.\n\nFiance needs to grow a spine now and possibly set some boundaries if FMIL is known for being pushy. There is no 'staying out of it' in a marriage; he's marrying you and needs to understand that you both should present a united front as a (soon-to-be) married couple.", "Does your FMIL have a surprise for your honeymoon, or is she just going to show up?\n\nGood luck, and maybe your fiance can get a room with her!\n\nThis is your future if your fiance needs to show her what MIL'S place is!\n\nOf course, NTA!!!!  That belongs to umm.....", "NTA. Your wedding, your family, your decision.  \u201cThat is so kind of you MIL, I love you too and appreciate that I can always rely on you when I really need a mom to lean on.  But I really want my sister to walk me down the aisle, with my sister at my side I know mom will be there with her girls. \u201c. Do try to find a way to honor MIL that day too, maybe give her a living call out if you make a speech.  And yes, your fianc\u00e9e needs to stand up for you here.  It\u2019s tough, you\u2019re both pretty young, but he needs to take the lead on this and firmly tell his mom to drop this, you love her but your sister is walking beside you.", "NTA.  You get to ask whomever you want to ask, and it's an emotional choice that no one can question.  I can't even imagine being so selfish as demanding to be in that spot.  Wow.  You have my sympathy for getting hitched up to her.", "NTA", "> My fiance wants to stay out of it\n\nUh  sorry buddy, that ain't how it works.\n\nYou wrangle your own family, you don't stay out of it when your mother is making unrealistic and inappropriate demands", "NTA!  NTA!!   NTA!!!  \nI don't believe anyone is on her side. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to grow a backbone and step up for you. There is no reason for her to expect you to have her walk you down the aisle. You are NOT her daughter and you have a family member who means a lot to you.   \nI truly do not understand how people have the audacity to make demands to be included in a wedding party when they are not asked. She's not needed in that capacity, tell her that her role is Mother of the Groom, nothing else.  \nIf your fianc\u00e9 speaks to her, all he has to do is say you've made a decision, and the subject is not open for discussion.  \nI want to warn you though, if he doesn't step up now you are getting a very clear look at your future. If he doesn't put you first now, he never will.", "NTA. \n\nYour call, no question. \n\nYour fiancee can\u2019t play Switzerland here: he\u2019s literally the link between the two of you. \n\nTime to step up for you. \n\n\u2018Mom, ___has my full support here.

It has become a sentiment of love and acceptance towards the spouse stating that the father or in your case the older sister is willingly giving their daughter or in your case their sister to the spouse with their blessing and letting the spouse know that they are welcomed into the family.  For your future MIL to walk you down the Asile would have been Extremely disrespectful to your family as it would symbolically say that your family is not part of your new union, \n\nYou should be offended she would offer such an insulting act at your wedding\n\nP.s. im also dyslexic and didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong with the title until the edit", "FMIL is a red flag but the biggest red flag is that fianc\u00e9 feels like he\u2019s stuck in the middle and wants to stay out of it.
