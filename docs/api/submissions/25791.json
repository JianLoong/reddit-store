She basically thinks everything is wrong unless it is done the way she wants. Some examples: one of my first experiences was during Christmas when my wife and I had been together about a year. MIL asked my wife to decorate the Christmas tree, wife (GF a the time) was very hesitant and I had no idea why. So she did as she was asked and her mom came home and took everything off and redid it. Another example is we take a beach trip every year. My wife and I for some reason always have the responsibility of putting up the beach tents/shade. Every single time there's something wrong like \"they're crooked\" or \"not the right height\" \"To close/to far from the shoreline\". To make it worse she describes her self as \"good with anything\" and \"going with the flow\" which she certainly is not. It annoys my wife as well but she just goes with it because she loves her mom very much. So now you have some idea where I am coming from with this event that transpired.\n\nMIL will only want food from certain fast food  places say like dominos, Taco Bell, chic-fil-a ect. While yes, some locations are certainly better than others it is certainly not to the extent that she makes it out to be. So the one that annoys me the most is American deli. So we have a few locations not far from us one is about 8 min the other is about 12 min. OFC she can't get food from either of those locations because they're \"gross\" and taste nothing like the one she likes. The one she likes is about a 20 min drive. So 40 minutes of driving total for fast food....then of course its kinda cold by the time we get it back so she has to heat it back up and complains about that as well....So the other night we decided to get some American deli, normally her mother orders but I said \"let me do it this time\". I then ordered from our nearest locations which she claims is \"the worse one\". I went there and got the food then sat in the parking lot so that it would take about the same amount of time. Got home, she heated it up. I asked her how it was and she said it was \"great\" and how she wishes the one closer to us could be so good. I of course had to open my mouth, couldn't just be satisfied with knowing I was right about how ridiculous she is. Her response was \"well this is the one time it was ever good\". Now my wife is kind of angry at me for doing that and having to hear her mom complain about it and my MIL is apparently very angry with me according to my wife. So AITA?\n\nTLDR: Mother in law makes ridiculous request that have no real reasoning behind them. Got food from a closer location than the one she claims is better, turns out it was totally ok.

I have diagnosed OCD, we think she has OCPD, but since I\u2019ve moved out she doesn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of diagnosis as her neurotic behaviour doesn\u2019t have an impact on her life these days.\n\n\nI grew up in a home where the Christmas tree was constantly \u2018re-done\u2019 and I understand the hurt it can cause. Everything had to be adjusted to be \u2018right\u2019, rooms had to be deep-cleaned daily to be \u2018right\u2019, and other people\u2019s feelings weren\u2019t considered because the environment had to be \u2018right\u2019.\n\n\nI grew up with constant intrusive thoughts about people around me dying; my brain decided keeping to certain food patterns and behaviours are one of the few preventative means of stopping people from dying. For example, I couldn\u2019t eat outside until I was 12 because I had this constant feeling most people around me would die if I didn\u2019t. I knew it was never okay to impose my weird food boundaries on other people, but if I broke my own rules I\u2019d be stuck in repeated panic attacks. I take a lot of medication, which helps, but I still have to stick to absolutely illogical rules regarding certain things - particularly food. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want to sit and armchair diagnose your MIL - she may just be an awkward bugger! Nonetheless, she clearly said she feels uncomfortable eating from certain locations. She has outlined her food boundaries, as illogical as they may be. You decided, you don\u2019t really give a fuck, squashed those boundaries and forced her to eat food she would normally feel uncomfortable eating.\n\n\nApologies again, but this idea of tricking your MIL with food she feels uncomfortable with is morally wrong. I don\u2019t eat meat but this reminds me a lot of the threads where people trick their partners into eating a veggie-burger to prove how good it is. Yes, the burger tastes good, but you\u2019re taking someone\u2019s agency away by intentionally fooling them and using it as a point. \n\n\nYou\u2019d be golden if you told MIL to bugger off and get her own food, but IMO tricking her about the source of food is really shitty - especially when she\u2019s expressed anxiety around food control!", "I'm going to buck the trend: ESH.\n\nYour MIL is exhausting and abusive and terrible.

A discussion always turns into, \u201cMy kids don\u2019t love me\u201d or \u201cI deserve respect\u201d after being called out on treating us with none. I avoid her as much as possible.", "I second this.", "But he's driving himself down there instead of expecting others to do it", "I disagree OP, keep fucking with her and don\u2019t let up. She deserves to be humiliated if this is the way she acts, let her embarrass herself over and over, at that point she\u2019s bringing it upon herself.", "I would say justifiable asshole.", "Pretty much.", "Yes, your partner has been trained by this woman for all her life. You need to start with your partner and asking her how she wants to handle her mother. You can tell her you aren't going to go along, but if she still is activated to do so, you would be making her life more difficult. You two need to be on the same page, and I suspect your partner is going to need a lot of help, essentially deprogramming from dear old mom. \n\nSource: similar situation with MY mom.", "Partner probably needs a therapist to help her learn to draw healthy boundaries because she has no idea how to do anything but indulge.", "I have a coworker that is just really particular about the stupidest stuff. Like the envelopes have to be facing a certain direction in the outgoing mail bin.   \nShe was complaining that her kids won't load the dishwasher. I flat out asked her if she moves things around after they load it, and she said yes! Because it's more efficient. \n\nTold her I wouldn't keep loading it either if I knew she was just going to redo it.\n\nShe's training them that it's not worth helping her because you are going to get crap either way so you might as well sit down.", "Yep, which is why OP also needs to talk to his wife about MIL's behavior. It's likely his wife has been conditioned to capitulate in order to avoid a tantrum from MIL. So it's going to take a bit to help her learn to stand up for herself/ her husband.", "I\u2019m so sorry! Sounds like a horrendous childhood but yes thats what i\u2019m saying. You avoid her as much as you can but OP is here sinking to her level and stressing their partner out", "Why is she living with you? Is it a culture thing?", "I would never tell her, so every time I go and get the food, I could take a 30 min nap in the parking lot", "Pretty long story. The short version is her husband passed and she was all by herself as all her children have moved away from where they grew up. We are currently in the process of building her a small guest house.", "MIL is the older version of the \"influencers\" who let their kids decorate the Christmas tree then go in and redo it \"for Instagram\" immediately afterward.

Good on ya", "NTA, but why do you continue to do things for Miss picky pants? Time for a little weaponized incompetence: \"Oh no, mom, you'd better do that. I'm sure to get it wrong.\"", "NTA. My mom is exactly the same way; she needs everything done exactly how she wants, where she wants, and when she wants, and it can get grating at times. Good for you for putting your foot down and exposing her weirdness with stuff. \n\nBut in the future, just stop entertaining her requests.

You should've just taken the satisfaction of knowing you were right and kept it to yourself.", "YTA for opening your mouth you were home free and now she doesn\u2019t trust you with the food runs anymore adding more stress", "NTA\n\nAs someone who is autistic and therefore also very particular with food, I understand MIL needing/wanting things a different way (although in this case sounds like it\u2019s more a control thing rather than the food actually tasting different to her) However, if you want/need something a certain way it\u2019s not fair to impose this on other people. If I need something to be a particular way I do it myself, if I don\u2019t like the food place my friends are ordering from, I order my own food myself at extra cost because that\u2019s what I like, I never make it anyone else\u2019s responsibility.

If you then complain about it, you don't get to eat any of it.\"", "You and your wife really need to go no contact with your mother-in-law because that is HUGELY RIDICULOUS!", "NTA - and I say this as someone whose sister dealt with a MIL like this for over 2 decades.

She, and her drama, are not missed.", "This isn\u2019t polite but it seems the MIL has bigger issues if she\u2019s eating enough of that food to believe she can taste the difference between locations.", "NTA - This reminds me of that episode in the Big Bang Theory.", "ESH.

I say I'll pick him up some lunch while I'm at the shops and the only thing he wants is an takeaway that is not on my way home and I'd have to get out of the car and let everyone else's food go cold.

Say \"I'm heading off to American Deli, be back in an hour.\" Go to the neighborhood pub for a pint, then when your time is almost up go to the closest location and pick up the food. Bingo, you just got out of an hour of your MIL's visit. You could even claim traffic and long lines \"because everyone knows that's the best franchise\" and stay for two pints. It might make it easier to tolerate her.", "I'd goto a different one every time and when she asks where you went just smile.", "Agreed. I would just shut my mouth and silently realize we can order from that store and just never tell her.", "The placebo effect is real. Sometimes placebos work even when we know they are placebos.

I learned this the hard way when my mom did the same thing: one year when I was in college she asked me to put the lights on the tree. So I did, spent a long time doing it perfectly as she's particular and there were a lot of lights. I went out for a bit, came home to find out she ripped it all down and redid it. There was nothing wrong with what I did--in fact, now that I have my own house and always get real trees, I usually do a totally slapdash version and it looks and works fine. AND my mom always makes a big deal about how nice my trees look. (They do look good, I have to say.) What I did for my parents' tree took 5X the effort than what I do at home, wrapping every light around a branch, etc. Anyway, after that I told her I wasn't ever doing it in her house again.
