She basically thinks everything is wrong unless it is done the way she wants. Some examples: one of my first experiences was during Christmas when my wife and I had been together about a year. MIL asked my wife to decorate the Christmas tree, wife (GF a the time) was very hesitant and I had no idea why. So she did as she was asked and her mom came home and took everything off and redid it. Another example is we take a beach trip every year. My wife and I for some reason always have the responsibility of putting up the beach tents/shade. Every single time there's something wrong like \"they're crooked\" or \"not the right height\" \"To close/to far from the shoreline\". To make it worse she describes her self as \"good with anything\" and \"going with the flow\" which she certainly is not. It annoys my wife as well but she just goes with it because she loves her mom very much. So now you have some idea where I am coming from with this event that transpired.\n\nMIL will only want food from certain fast food  places say like dominos, Taco Bell, chic-fil-a ect. While yes, some locations are certainly better than others it is certainly not to the extent that she makes it out to be. So the one that annoys me the most is American deli. So we have a few locations not far from us one is about 8 min the other is about 12 min. OFC she can't get food from either of those locations because they're \"gross\" and taste nothing like the one she likes. The one she likes is about a 20 min drive. So 40 minutes of driving total for fast food....then of course its kinda cold by the time we get it back so she has to heat it back up and complains about that as well....So the other night we decided to get some American deli, normally her mother orders but I said \"let me do it this time\". I then ordered from our nearest locations which she claims is \"the worse one\". I went there and got the food then sat in the parking lot so that it would take about the same amount of time. Got home, she heated it up. I asked her how it was and she said it was \"great\" and how she wishes the one closer to us could be so good. I of course had to open my mouth, couldn't just be satisfied with knowing I was right about how ridiculous she is. Her response was \"well this is the one time it was ever good\". Now my wife is kind of angry at me for doing that and having to hear her mom complain about it and my MIL is apparently very angry with me according to my wife. So AITA?\n\nTLDR: Mother in law makes ridiculous request that have no real reasoning behind them. Got food from a closer location than the one she claims is better, turns out it was totally ok.

I have diagnosed OCD, we think she has OCPD, but since I\u2019ve moved out she doesn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of diagnosis as her neurotic behaviour doesn\u2019t have an impact on her life these days.\n\n\nI grew up in a home where the Christmas tree was constantly \u2018re-done\u2019 and I understand the hurt it can cause. Everything had to be adjusted to be \u2018right\u2019, rooms had to be deep-cleaned daily to be \u2018right\u2019, and other people\u2019s feelings weren\u2019t considered because the environment had to be \u2018right\u2019.\n\n\nI grew up with constant intrusive thoughts about people around me dying; my brain decided keeping to certain food patterns and behaviours are one of the few preventative means of stopping people from dying. For example, I couldn\u2019t eat outside until I was 12 because I had this constant feeling most people around me would die if I didn\u2019t. I knew it was never okay to impose my weird food boundaries on other people, but if I broke my own rules I\u2019d be stuck in repeated panic attacks. I take a lot of medication, which helps, but I still have to stick to absolutely illogical rules regarding certain things - particularly food. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want to sit and armchair diagnose your MIL - she may just be an awkward bugger! Nonetheless, she clearly said she feels uncomfortable eating from certain locations. She has outlined her food boundaries, as illogical as they may be. You decided, you don\u2019t really give a fuck, squashed those boundaries and forced her to eat food she would normally feel uncomfortable eating.\n\n\nApologies again, but this idea of tricking your MIL with food she feels uncomfortable with is morally wrong. I don\u2019t eat meat but this reminds me a lot of the threads where people trick their partners into eating a veggie-burger to prove how good it is. Yes, the burger tastes good, but you\u2019re taking someone\u2019s agency away by intentionally fooling them and using it as a point. \n\n\nYou\u2019d be golden if you told MIL to bugger off and get her own food, but IMO tricking her about the source of food is really shitty - especially when she\u2019s expressed anxiety around food control!", "I'm going to buck the trend: ESH.\n\nYour MIL is exhausting and abusive and terrible.

It's like she's been living with a sleeping bear she's learned to tip-toe around over the years and then you came along and stuck a pitchfork in it's a$$. At the same time she shouldn't be getting angry with you for getting fed up having to walk on eggshells. MIL sounds like she has major control issues she needs to work out.", "Sounds like she kinda deserved it, but you shot yourself in the foot kinda...", "To think you could keep going to that one anytime she's over but now you ruined it!  The one time MIL wasn't complaining you had to instigate it!\nESH except your wife!", "Are you living with her?  She seems to be around a lot. Depends on who paid for the food. If I\u2019m spending my money and buying you dinner, I\u2019m going to tell you where I\u2019m going. American deli closest to me. You want anything?\n\nIf she says she doesn\u2019t like that one say, so you don\u2019t want anything?  See what happens.", "I find it hilarious how this entire comment section is handling the wife with such kid gloves. \n\nLiterally every aita where the husband agrees with anyone besides his wife, heaven forbid agree with his mother is: \"husband issue. Dump the husband, he's so toxic\"\n\nAnd here we have a situation where the wife is enabling her mother and making her husband enable her mother's crazy and it's all: \" well op isn't doing enough to help his wife stand up to her mom\" like, you know you can't have it both ways, right?", "NTA. All I can think of as I read this is that one post in JustNoMIL called \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat.\u201d If you haven\u2019t read it before, I would highly recommend it. Your wife is probably mad because she is one of the boat-steadiers, whose job it is to keep the boat from capsizing as her mom makes waves. She may not know any other way to live. But what she can\u2019t see, and what you can, is that the problem isn\u2019t that you aren\u2019t steadying the boat, it\u2019s that her mom keeps rocking it in the first place. Godspeed and good luck buddy.", "NTA and I would absolutely refuse to go that far for fast food ever again. There is nothing worse than having to reheat fast food especially when you don't need to because there is a location closer. Your MIL is like this because everyone around her has enabled this behavior for forever. If she wants something from a specific place or done a certain way, than make her do it. If she can't, than that is a her problem and should no longer be a you problem.", "NTA I\u2019m truly not picky but the Dairy Queen by me makes great hamburgers while the one by my sister\u2019s absolutely suck. Different owners and I\u2019ve always wondered if the one by my sister\u2019s add filler.  They are not the same burger.", "YTA for not knowing when to shut your sandwich hole and take the W", "The only mistake you made was telling her. Your MIL rather be right than have healthy relationships. I would not be setting up the tent, decorating trees etc for her. I would tell her \" Mildred you are never happy with the results so we are leaving this up to you.\" NTA.", "Everyone is missing the point- she clearly likes this food reheated! That\u2019s why it tastes so much better", "Tell your wife she can deal with her mother's behaviour and get her orders from now on since she's upset at you for calling out her mother's behaviour.", "NTA, but an idiot. You couldn't keep your mouth shut. You could have waited and just told your wife. Now your wife is never going to hear the end of it. Therefore you're never going to hear the end of it.", " Nta but stop doing what she asks", "NTA but why play these games? Why even try to please her? Instead say \u201cwe are going to _____ do you want us to pick you up something from there?\u201d Also if you live with her, move out!", "Next time go to the location she likes and she will say it's terrible \"you got this from x location again\" then show her you got it from the she likes. Lol", "Has your wife ever just said, \"No. I don't want to decorate the tree this year.\"  Or my personal favorite: the Christmas Tree Agreement. It details and codifies the rights and responsibilities of (tree owner) and (tree decorator). It should clearly state that mom gets to relocate up but no more than four ornaments. After the move(s) are complete, a photo will be taken to confirm that no unauthorized  ornament relocations have been executed. In the event that mom violates this agreement in action or intent, the wife may: claim up to 10 ornaments for possession and destroy any single ornament. \n\nI really need to figure out this insomnia.", "ESH\n\n I love what you did, but you probably shouldn't have opened your mouth.", "The ingredients were all the same. It was just made by different people. It sat in a car for 20 minutes and was nuked back to hot. If there was a difference in quality, it was long past noticing.", "Every time and go to the one she likes and lie about where you got it from.", "Honestly, I am fussy about things sometimes. There are things that bother me that like. Truly don't matter, but they do bother me. So either I DO IT ENTIRELY MYSELF or I take the time to explain why, and how I WOULD do them, and I try to make sure I do it in a time that's calm and not like when the thing is happening, you know?\n\nLike I like when decorations are symmetrical or \"balanced\". My mom makes fun of me for it, but she just does it now because, like, it doesn't bug her either way and it doesn't take longer.\n\nOr like I like to have a \"best bite\" last and it bums me out if that doesn't happen so if we split an order of fries, she asks me which one my last fry is gonna be XD\n\nAnd sometimes it's funny, like when we decorate the tree and I'll see what she's done and I'm like, \"Okay. You put on 7 ornaments, that's awesome! Can I ask why 5 of them are the exact same ornament and they're all in a one foot patch?\" and she just like did not notice.\n\nLike it's not... it's not a big deal to have preferences and you communicate them in a respectful way. You don't have to be an asshole about it.", "Haha. My therapist sent me a selfie. From her boat. That I paid for.", "Yesh.. she can get it herself next time..", "My sister was like this. There are many stories, but this one is applicable here:\n\nAs a preface, she was DEATHLY allergic to shellfish. This was absolutely true and kind of terrifying to behold when her arm touched a lobster shell and her limb went all funhouse mirror on her. However, she also ***claimed*** to be equally allergic to all seafood, which isn't actually a thing. If you are allergic to all seafood, it means you are allergic to...food. She might as well have said she was allergic to plants with leaves or meat from animals with legs.\n\nAnyway, she is busily enjoying the BEST California rolls she has ever had (...courtesy of 7-11) and I went ahead and pointed out that it is made with imitation crab meat. She went on for five minutes about what \"imitation\" means. I then pointed out it was not crab, no, but white fish, one of those things that live in the sea.\n\nAfter about 5-6 seconds of looking at me like I had two heads, she flipped over the container, read the ingredients list made up some BS about always having an upset stomach after, and never ate one of her favorite foods again. Some people will make real sacrifices to save face.\n\nOn the plus side, she was way more diligent about reading food labels, which probably saved her an emergency room visit or two regarding her ACTUAL allergy.", "ESH, you even said it.\n\n> I of course had to open my mouth, couldn't just be satisfied with knowing I was right about how ridiculous she is.\n\nYou wanted to outjerk the jerk, makes you both jerks.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI have a boundary I enforce with people like this \"You can ask me to do it or you can tell me how you want it done, but you can't do both\".  \n\n\nIt makes me crazy when people ask me to do something and then criticize how it is done.", "Your only mistake was telling her. NTA.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like she has been brainwashed. You MIL sounds insufferable"]}
