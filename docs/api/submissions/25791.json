{"id": 25791, "submission_id": "164jthd", "title": "AITA for getting my mother in law the exact same food from a different location?", "selftext": "So, my mother in law is a very particular person. She basically thinks everything is wrong unless it is done the way she wants. Some examples: one of my first experiences was during Christmas when my wife and I had been together about a year. MIL asked my wife to decorate the Christmas tree, wife (GF a the time) was very hesitant and I had no idea why. So she did as she was asked and her mom came home and took everything off and redid it. Another example is we take a beach trip every year. My wife and I for some reason always have the responsibility of putting up the beach tents/shade. Every single time there's something wrong like \"they're crooked\" or \"not the right height\" \"To close/to far from the shoreline\". To make it worse she describes her self as \"good with anything\" and \"going with the flow\" which she certainly is not. It annoys my wife as well but she just goes with it because she loves her mom very much. So now you have some idea where I am coming from with this event that transpired.\n\nMIL will only want food from certain fast food  places say like dominos, Taco Bell, chic-fil-a ect. While yes, some locations are certainly better than others it is certainly not to the extent that she makes it out to be. So the one that annoys me the most is American deli. So we have a few locations not far from us one is about 8 min the other is about 12 min. OFC she can't get food from either of those locations because they're \"gross\" and taste nothing like the one she likes. The one she likes is about a 20 min drive. So 40 minutes of driving total for fast food....then of course its kinda cold by the time we get it back so she has to heat it back up and complains about that as well....So the other night we decided to get some American deli, normally her mother orders but I said \"let me do it this time\". I then ordered from our nearest locations which she claims is \"the worse one\". I went there and got the food then sat in the parking lot so that it would take about the same amount of time. Got home, she heated it up. I asked her how it was and she said it was \"great\" and how she wishes the one closer to us could be so good. I of course had to open my mouth, couldn't just be satisfied with knowing I was right about how ridiculous she is. Her response was \"well this is the one time it was ever good\". Now my wife is kind of angry at me for doing that and having to hear her mom complain about it and my MIL is apparently very angry with me according to my wife. So AITA?\n\nTLDR: Mother in law makes ridiculous request that have no real reasoning behind them. Got food from a closer location than the one she claims is better, turns out it was totally ok.
