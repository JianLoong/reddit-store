I almost didn't go visit my sister and my new nephew for the same reasons but I'm really glad I did, although you can't make me look at the pictures of myself, damnit!! I do have nice teeth again so at least I'm, well.. Less self deprecating..", "Info: what are you doing to manage your mental health/weight? \nBut I really think you should go. It\u2019s their wedding. You\u2019re their child and you already agreed to go. Nobody is going to be paying attention to you, but you will regret missing it.", "YTA sorry\n\nI thought this would be because you couldn't afford travel or something. Your insecurity about your weight is valid, but do you genuinely want to miss out on important life events for the people you care about because of it??? You're not being an asshole for letting down your parents you're being an asshole for letting your weight be in charge of your life. You deserve to go to weddings and have fun, wear a nice dress, feel beautiful in the body you're in. Your issues are valid. Do you really want to let them keep controlling you?", "Oh God, this is hard. First, your parents definitely overreacted, at least your mother did. Sure, she's hurt, but you don't hurt your child especially when they are in a vulnerable position, like you were/like you are.\n\nTwo, get to therapy, there certainly is a psychological element to your weight. And your parents are not that nice. Not if they reacted like this. Therapy will help you unravel all of this. \n\nThree... I don't know. This situation is too heartbreaking I don't want to judge, but ok, NTA, but maybe try to see if you can make it to the wedding, it's one night and it will avoid breaking your family apart.", "ESH Your mother was particularly cruel. It was unnecessary. But you are also hurting them by not showing up on the big day. \n\nThe most important part, though, is that you are hurting yourself. \n\nI\u2019ve been where you are. I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s, only 5\u20193\u201d and I\u2019ve spent my whole life struggling with obesity. I\u2019ve been 400 lbs and I\u2019ve been 180. I\u2019m struggling right now to continue my weight loss after gaining a lot back. I have anxiety and depression. It controls my whole life. It sounds like it might control yours too. \n\nMy advice? Don\u2019t avoid living your life. If you want to go to that wedding, go to that wedding. Don\u2019t worry about how you look. Worry about how you feel. If people are rude to you, then walk away. You owe them nothing. You only owe yourself happiness and peace and your parents your support.  \n\nI thought I saw in another comment that you are also avoiding therapy. I\u2019m right there with you. Some advice from someone a little older than you? Don\u2019t wait. It\u2019s scary, I know, and embarrassing, I know, but please take that first step. \n\nYou\u2019re not gross. You\u2019re not ugly. You\u2019re not bad. You are struggling and you are human. And you deserve to live your life like everyone else. \n\nI genuinely wish you luck. Take small steps. Be brave. And don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m so glad to see that my words had a positive influence on some of you.  It\u2019s also touched me to see so much support and kindness towards OP. Living can be a complicated and scary thing, but I really believe we\u2019re all better off if we remember to be kind to each other and to ourselves.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an AH because I am a recovering food and sugar addict who weighed 300 pounds at 19.So I do understand that it\u2019s hard and difficult and humiliating. But this day is not about you. It\u2019s about them. And they want you there to celebrate them. So NAH but change your mind and go to celebrate them.", "Had an uncle who weighed about the same as you, he often said no to big events for probably the same reason as you. I think he was very lonely. \n\nPlease don\u2019t isolate yourself.  Please don\u2019t be ashamed of who you are. There\u2019s absolutely no way you would be embarrassing anyone by being at the wedding. \n\nYour parents on the other hand should be ashamed of themselves for the way the handle the situation. There reaction should have been \u201cwe are so sorry you feel that way, how can we help you feel better about yourself?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m so sorry but your parents are not lovely people, they\u2019re absolutely horrible. I\u2019ll be surprised if being raised by AH like this is part of why you\u2019re overeating. \n\nPlease do get help with your mental health. You are worth way more respect, than your parents are showing you.", "NAH.   I think you\u2019re totally missing the forest for the trees here.  Your parents wedding is a day to celebrate THEM. Not showing up at their wedding because you\u2019re self conscious about how you look is disrespectful to them and doesn\u2019t change one damn thing about your weight. I understand why they reacted badly.  I also understand why you don\u2019t want to go. It will be awkward, but please do set yourself aside for a few hours to celebrate your parents.   And yes, they do also owe you an apology.", "Oh this is tough\u2026.\nI don\u2019t know you, all I just want to say is that whatever you look like doesn\u2019t matter, your personality is what makes you a nice person to be around. I understand that shame is something that is very hard to deal with, and that you\u2019re afraid of other peoples reactions and opinions. \n\nfighting this monster in your head that is holding you back, is not just defeatable by weight loss.\nThe monster is not YOU. It\u2019s the fear of other people confirming what you are thinking, so the hack would be to change your mindset.\n\nThe real question is: if you were not afraid of other peoples opinions, would you go?\nIf the answer is yes, then please, don\u2019t punish yourself and be there!\nIf the answer is no, then don\u2019t go. But don\u2019t let your fears dictate your actions. You deserve to be happy, despite what other people think.\n\nApart from that it sounds to me that you are having judgement about yourself\u2026.\nDon\u2019t judge, but analize! Wether that means accepting who you are right now, and owning that and being happy, or making changes in your life to become the person you want to be.\nBoth is possible. Really! And that is not about your body, but about your mindset.\nYou can do it! Choose your own happiness :)\n\nWhatever you do, choose you. And allow yourself to choose what makes YOU happy.", "NAH, those are words of anger I'm sure your mother didn't mean it. If you feel like that about yourself then you can start changing your lifestyle, I'm sure a doctor can get you in the right way.", "Your concern about attending is valid. I have relatives who are not well and even they do not feel comfortable at social gatherings for reasons that might not be understandable to other people. For some reason, they are not ready to face people even though these people will likely show them support. \n\nYour parents should have comforted you and alley your fears and tell you how your presence is needed that day because it would mean so much to them. \n\nNot sure why your mother needed to be so nasty. While other redditors say its about them and not about you, i disagree. Sometimes, we expect our parents to be most understanding to our most unreasonable concerns because they would have seen our struggle. Who else will shower such grace to us?", "NTA. Aw mate. I'm sorry. You need support, not your parents berating you. They're hurt and that's understandable, but those comments...ouch. Please don't be embarrassed to reach out for help- some therapists specialise in our relationships with food.", "NTA... you likely have a health problem. It has caused you hurt and anxiety. This doesnt make you evil or a bad daughter. You still deserve love and support while you try to treat yourself with more care. Be kind to yourself, you can't fix your parents lack of empathy.", "I sympathise with you but still, YTA. I totally 100% get why you don't want to be seen. But do you think these family / friends don't already know that you are obese? If they are close enough to you that you value their judgements, then they probably know you well enough to know this.\n\nIf you care about their judgements, then as it stands now, you won't be seen as \"Their daughter who put on a lot of weight\". You'll be seen as \"their daughter who didn't even attend the wedding\", which imo is a lot more negative, and something which can never be changed. If you wanted to put in the effort, you'll be able to lose weight again. But you will never reverse the decision to skip their wedding.\n\nSorry if I come across as rude. Just trying to be honest. I wish you the best with your journey towards good health.", "As a fat guy you are choosing food over family... YTA", "I wish that your parents had reacted with more love than anger, but this is not an AH situation. You mention in a comment that you're neglecting both your mental and physical health. Maybe give your parents the wedding gift of addressing both of these things? It sounds like you are suffering from depression, and I urge you to seek help.", "I feel like this beyond what Reddit\u2019s pay grade but if I have to give a judgment I will say ESH. You TA to yourself because it seems to me like you don\u2019t love yourself and have low-self esteem and rather than do anything about it you\u2019re choosing to hide yourself away. That makes me really sad for you. I would really encourage you to find a therapist because you don\u2019t have to feel like this forever and he/she can help you start to feel better. Your mom is TA for her harsh comment to you and she should apologize. I understand her being upset but that\u2019s no way to talk to her daughter.", "NTA because ultimately you know what's best for you,but you should really seek help to improve your self-esteem, you worth so much than your weight, you shouldn't shut yourself and miss important events in life just because of that. Your parents reaction may come from anger or disappointment for they wished you were here for their celebration, of course, but also maybe because they see you are more and more reclusive and they worry (but your mother was harsh, no doubt).", "NAH but just go to your doctor. There are treatments available, you deserve medical care", "NAH. Everyone is hurting and struggling. I really think you can do this though. We build stuff up in our head until we choose to hide away from it. You have plenty to offer this world but it does start with you leaving that comfort zone. There is love & support all around you, you just have to accept it. \n\nI know it's impossible at times, but all we can do is move forward. Come join r/loseit. It's a super supportive weight loss group of all shapes and sizes. No judgement, just helping eachother to see our goals.", "They have shown you love and support all your life. And you are CHOOSING not to be for them when they want your support. People will tell you what you want to hear, but that's not how reality works. YTA for making this about you. You truly should not be surprised that the people you don't support have finally given up. You hurt their feelings one too many times.", "I think I\u2019m going to get downvoted within an inch of my life, but I\u2019m going to go NTA. It\u2019s sad and honestly, I get entirely where they\u2019re coming from. They love you tremendously or at least I\u2019m assuming they do. You\u2019re their daughter and as a parent, that\u2019s a love that those without kids will never understand. They don\u2019t see 412lbs of \u201cugly\u201d (despite what they said in anger) They see their daughter whom they love. They desperately want you to be a part of the day\u2026. But that still doesn\u2019t make you the asshole. You have valid reasons and it\u2019s understandable why it\u2019s a situation that you\u2019re fairly terrified of. It doesn\u2019t make them assholes either. It\u2019s just a sad situation.", "N A H if your mom had reacted like your dad; NTA because of her comments.\n\nYou\u2019re not attending because of a combination of physical and mental health issues. It\u2019s not a preference; attending would be an undue hardship. So not an A.\n\nIt sounds like your parents were very emotionally invested in you attending. That\u2019s to their credit.  And it\u2019s also quite understandable for this news to be upsetting. They love you and what you to be part of their special day, and have just learned that you won\u2019t be. That\u2019s how your dad seems to have reacted hence the world-be N A H.\n\nBut your mom\u2019s comments are vile. She is channeling her sadness and disappointment in destructive ways and had no right to treat you that way based on her negative feelings. Hence, she\u2019s an A here so N T A", "Esh\n\nYour parents comments were rude. Your mom's in particular were excruciatingly vile.\n\nYou, however, seem too nonchalant for someone who is walking herself to an early grave.", "I'd lean NAH but you're mother definitely overreacted so NTA but this is such a hard story. Your parents are probably worried about you because you're giving up on going to life events and not only that but you said you barely leave your apartment. There's definitely a psychological side to your eating and it probably revolves around depression. The more you eat the more depressed and self conscious you feel, the more self conscious and depressed the more you eat, its a vicious circle. I'd definitely look for some therapy and using this as a motivator to try and lose weight, it seems extremely hard but it's definitely possible. As far as the wedding goes, I'd try to go even if you don't go the whole time, as you said it's people you hardly see, so who gives a shit what they think. Even if you only make the ceremony at least you're there for your parents because they want you there because you're a part of who they are.", "NTA. My sweet you need self-love and self- care,  you deserve better than feeling the way you do.", "NTA. Way to be abusive rather than supportive. If this is how they act I wouldn\u2019t go either. I hope things get better", ">they\u2019re honestly lovely people and the best parents I could ever ask for\n\n>My mom got angry and told me that I\u2019m betraying them, and that I\u2019m going to look like an embarrassment. She told me that I deserve to look like this and she won\u2019t be there to help me when I end up eating myself to death at 40, and that I\u2019ve ruined our relationship.\n\nThose two sentences don't go together.  Loving parents don't say such mean things to their kids.  Does your mom have a history of saying mean and bullying things to you?  Doesn't matter if it's just out of anger, it still has an effect on you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to go to their wedding if they're going to treat you like that. However, if you're feeling unhappy, do something that's going to change that.", "NTA- i do think that being their for your parents special night should trump your fear of potential embarrassment, as i don\u2019t think you have any reason to be embarrassed. nobody is perfect. they love you and i\u2019m sure the rest of your family loves you too, so it shouldn\u2019t matter. you should ask yourself how you would feel if the roles were reversed. if you would be understanding if the roles were reversed, then that settles it, then they should be understanding with you. but if you would not be understanding about it, then that would just be a double standard", "NTA.  The way your parents reacted was totally out of line.  Your motivations are pure, and honestly there's nothing wrong with what you've chosen to do.  On top of that, you're not obligated to attend their wedding regardless of reason.", "NTA.  You were kind and caring enough to explain WHY you don't feel comfortable being there. You could have just said no, but instead you explained yourself and they belittled you and made you feel even worse?  FUCK THEM!\n\nI'm not tiny by any stretch of the imagination and I have absolutely skipped events because I couldn't find something I felt made me look okay enough to be there. Now at 45 I just do and wear what I want and everyone else can fuck off if they don't like it...but i certainly would have been like you just a couple years ago.  Hang in there and if you WANT to lose weight then good on you and you'll figure it out, if not that's okay too, just take care of yourself...physically AND mentally.", "Your NTA.

At one point I'd avoid food/liquids that day so I could wear 2-4 pairs of spanx. Darker clothing also helps. \n\nI'm recently 80lbs down and wore colour and something that showed off my arms and I felt great. I still doubled up on the spanx (I will probably never stop) but I felt ok enough to eat and enjoy the party. \n\nYou have time to find something that you feel comfortable with also if you want to, to try and lose some weight.

Like you, always big, but it got very bad after high school. I was 21 (this was 12 years ago now) and getting married and I needed her to be my maid of honor. There was no one else who felt right in that role. She shed a LOT of tears trying to find a dress to wear and multiple times told me she wasn't doing it because she didn't want to be looked at, and especially didn't want to be in pictures. She did end up being there (she was actually part of the reason I kept the event small and very limited invite), but she didn't stay long at the reception because her anxiety got quite high. I felt bad to pressure her, but it was also SO important to me that she was there and now it means the world to me to have those photos of her-because she died at age 32. \n\n\nThat all said, I'm going with a very gentle everyone kinda sucks, with the parents being a bit more of the AH, because I understand your parents need to have someone so important in their life at their wedding. BUT, if they really talked to you that way and told you you deserve it and don't want to have a relationship with you, that's awful and I'm sorry. I never would have done that to her. \n\nPlease take care of yourself. It's not too late.", "Oh geeze.  I mean, I sympathize.  I really do.  I hate meeting my family.  I'm afraid they're going to judge me too, for all sorts of reasons.  So I haven't seen my extended family in probably 30 years.  I wouldn't even see my sister if she didn't make the effort to visit me.\n\nI guess the question is, do you want to be like me?  Socially isolated at 45?  Going days without even speaking a single word because you had a couple of days off from work and you didn't interact with a single person?  Because once you start avoiding people, it only snowballs from there.  The more you do it, the easier it is to *keep* doing it, until you've lost all the connections you've ever made.\n\nYour mom was hurt, and so she was hurtful in response.  The thing is, I think you're going to feel awful either way.  I think you'll feel awkward and uncomfortable if you go to the wedding, but I think you'll feel awful and guilty if you don't go.  So if you're going to feel bad about yourself regardless, maybe resist the urge to hide?  \n\nMaybe use this as a wake-up call, that you need to start making a serious change for your heath.  Not for your appearance - for your health.  Your weight is dangerous - I know you know that.  And the effects are going to get worse as you age.  I'm overweight by about 40 pounds, and the older I get, the more I *know* it in my joints.  My knees just... hurt.  I actually had to get physical therapy for them, and there was a point where they told me there was only so much they could do without surgery.  But if I lost weight, it would help a great deal to relieve some of that pressure.  When I run to catch the bus, even if it's just across the street, I get winded.  I have a hard time breathing.  That's really bad.  I know it.  And I need to take better care of my health, to improve my quality of life.  It's not about how I look - it's about how my body feels.\n\nI'm not going to judge anyone here.  Your mom was out of line, maybe she was blindsided and just reacted without thinking.  And there was a kernel of truth in her twisted words - you are more likely to die early because of your weight.  She's probably terrified of losing you.", "YTA yes they overreacted but you can't blame them either if roles were reversed and your mom would not come to your wedding you would be hurt too. \n\nSecondly what you are feeling and what you are doing I have been there and not going outside, no interactions with anyone unless necessary but you know this is not going to help OP. I think you should consult a good doctor and find out why you have an unhealthy relationship with food. I am overweight (just got gastric sleeve, losing little by little) I think my turning point was getting my blood glucose check, knee pains, and felt like dying just by walking. At that point I thought if I don't do anything either I will die or have my elderly parents take care of me. And I wanted none of it.", "NTA... but.. this event isn't about you.  It's a celebration of your parents' love and commitment to each other.  I can see why they are sad and angry about your change of heart... they are feeling like you don't think they are important to them.  They asked you to be there because they love you, and they *want* their child there with them.  They already know what you look like.  I think you should go. \n\nNice clothes don't look bad on people.  Go shopping at a nice store.  Some stores cater to women your size.  Let a personal shopper work with you.  They know how to make people feel good about themselves.  Call ahead to schedule an appointment with someone who has experience in dressing heavy people.  If money is a concern, would your mother help since this is so important to her?   You can also rent nice things for less money than what buying costs.  (You don't even have to buy anything from the shopper... people usually do, but it's perfectly OK to say you need to think about things, and then rent something for less.  They may charge for their time, but not all do.)\n\nHave your makeup and hair done for the occasion.  Go for a practice run a few weeks before if you aren't sure what you want. \n\nTo really dig into things and get better, you need more time than just now through July\u2014but a therapist can help you with some strategies to deal with the social anxiety you have in time for the wedding.  Over time, this will hold you back far more than your weight ever will.  You might consider a very small dose of an anxiolytic.  It will help you not feel so nervous.  Many people need something to help with anxiety in any number of situations.  It's not a crutch or a sign of weakness to treat known conditions so you can function better. \n\nIf you can't stomach the idea of making small talk all night long, go to the wedding and skip the reception.  If someone comments on your weight, say, \"That's really rude,\" and *walk away*.  Nobody can make you feel bad if you don't let them, and practicing this will not only help your self-confidence, it will force people to recognize their own issues.  Do you have a friend you can bring as a plus 1?  That is really helpful in situations like this.\n\nMy dad has a cousin who is really heavy.  She wears bright colors and is in the middle of every picture.  The rest of us are not as heavy, and we understand it's just how things played out for her... but she decided to be comfortable and to enjoy her life.  It was a conscious decision on her part.  \n\nYou are so much more than your weight.  Talk to your parents again about your worries.  Ask them how they can support you so you all can have an enjoyable time.  And, seriously consider the suggestion of attending the ceremony but not the reception.  You deserve a life outside of your apartment. \n\nGood luck.  I hope the best for you.", "I'm not giving judgment.

That's my challenge, and I have to face it because I want to love myself and want to enjoy the life out there. \n\nIf you want to chat so we can hype each other please hit my DMs!!!! I can share some great, light excercise videos we can use together, and we can talk about our days and I can offer support whenever. I mean, I'm stuck to my phone constantly, there's no way I'll miss a text.\n\nPlease go to the wedding. Fuck whoever wants to mumble about your body. They don't know the battle within, and it's frankly none of their damn business.", ">they\u2019re honestly lovely people and the best parents I could ever ask for\n\nNo, they are not lovely people when they react like this...\n\n>My mom got angry and told me that I\u2019m betraying them, and that I\u2019m going to look like an embarrassment. She told me that I deserve to look like this and she won\u2019t be there to help me when I end up eating myself to death at 40, and that I\u2019ve ruined our relationship.\n>my dad looked upset and stepped outside because he said he didn\u2019t want to be part of this conversation anymore.\n\n\"Best parents\" would not get angry at you for you having self- confidence issues, weight problems, physical/ mental/ emotional health problems, and being so hard on yourself that you don't want to be seen in public, they would work to reassure you, help boost your confidence, and try to help you get the help you need - doctor, nutritionist, therapist - to be healthy and happy. \n\nMake an appointment with your physician. If you can't afford it, check into community clinics - they often bill on a sliding scale, from full price all the way down to free, depending on what the patient can afford. Ask for help making sure you're healthy and referral to a nutritionist for help to start losing weight. Ask, also, for referral to counseling, to help with your self-esteem issues. You DO deserve health and happiness! \n\nPersonally, I would avoid the wedding- not because of the weight, but because of how horrible your parents are acting when you need their non-judgmental support.\n\nYou can do this!", "Your mother's comments were unnecessary and for those reasons alone, I would not go.  But why hasn't anyone asked why are your parents getting married?  Are they not married now?  Is this a second wedding and they are throwing themselves a big party which makes this a not very important event?", "NTA. There is something very wrong here and it is not you. What your mother did is inexcusable and cruel.", "NTA. Your mom is making your health issue (whatever is causing this weight game) all about her and acting as if you wanted this. You should definitely go see a doctor who specializes in this kind ot thing but it's none of her business. \nAlso nobody is entitled to have specific guests at their wedding? Especially if they're this rude to them", "Are you in therapy? You seem to be dealing with depression-like symptoms, and you won't be able to lose any weight until the mental blockages are dealt with first\n\nI was going to say N A H until:\n\n\n>My mom got angry and told me that I\u2019m betraying them, and that I\u2019m going to look like an embarrassment.

You said you are struggling to leave the house due to your self esteem and her response was to rip your appearance to shreds? That is horrific\n\nGo to therapy, work on your agoraphobia and self confidence, but do it for *you*, because *you* deserve to be happy in yourself. When you dont attach feelings of shame to your body, then it'll be easier to focus on your health\n\nAs for your parents, fuck them and fuck their wedding. The reason you shouldn't go is because they are vicious bullies, not because of your appearance. If any family members ask if you're going, say no and give them a direct quote of what your own mother said to you\n\nI wish you luck with both your mental and physical health, and hope you find a loving support system to help you", "NTA, however still not making the right choice. NTA for not wanting to go because you social problems. However, you should work on those problem so they aren\u2019t the problem. When you have problems that start to critically cripple you socially like in this case you should work on them. Find ways to turn a corner, push past your comfort zone, and find help. I really want to say ATA for not attending your parents wedding; however, I understand social anxiety and how it can completely demotivate you, and cause you to live your life in a way that walks around the problem. It is hard to get around the hump, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should live a life of complacency.", "NTA, but you need help. I understand why your parents are hurt and I agree that they did not react the best way, buy you are hurting your self. I know it is not as easier as just say \"I want to lose weight\", but I also know that missing the wedding it's just avoid an awkward experience.\nPlease... Just try... Take care of yourself.", "My judgment is ESH but if I could hug you tightly and let you know you are NOT alone, I would. I give this judgment only with respect to the issue at hand - not attending your parents\u2019 wedding. I really would not even call you an asshole, but I hope that you can find a way - the courage - to experience life. To experience joy and excitement and happiness. You deserve to feel these things, regardless of your weight or how you feel about how you look. So as with many here I strongly recommend seeking a good therapist who will support you. I\u2019m afraid your parents, who may mean well and are justifiably hurt that you won\u2019t attend, don\u2019t seem very supportive. \n\nYou are not alone. \nYou are worth loving, and celebrating. \nYou are worth fighting for.", "While your mother\u2019s vile comment to you places her in a bad light, I think that their decision to marry after so many years as a couple is both a commitment going forward and a celebration of their life together 30 plus years. You are their child, a center of their relationship for so long they \nwish to now sanctify.  I think they have received your declining to attend their wedding as a wholesale rejection of them, and they were clearly devastated by your decision. You will be conspicuously absent on their wedding day. \n\nI do understand your discomfort, but I think you are shortchanging yourself. Wedding receptions people generally are on their best behavior and as the daughter of the couple you are in a favored position. Lastly, I don\u2019t know where you live but if it\u2019s the USA, even a 5\u20192\u201d 400lb woman is not an unprecedented sight for most people. There is nothing in your writings that indicates you are a disagreeable person but rather a sensitive thoughtful kind (and in my mind internally misguided ) person whose qualities trump appearance. Think about changing your mind. It will be a constructive step in changing yourself and your relationship with the outside world.", "Have you considered a gastric bypass? I had one a year ago and I have my life back. It wasn\u2019t as big a deal as you\u2019d think. The only inconvenience is I have to take a daily multivitamin.", "This was me two years ago. I hated going out because people are terrible. I hated going anywhere because I was winded after a few steps. It was humiliating no matter if people were understanding.  The anxiety of being around people who were smaller than me always made me want to just disappear.  But I looked beyond the present to picture my future, and I realized that I was taking a very long route to ending my life, because I didn't think that I deserved to live a happy life. \n\nIf you are able to, find a DIRECT Primary Care Doctor. Preferably one who specializes in weight loss.  It took me a while, but she's been a life saver.  You pay a flat fee a month, but that means that your doctor isn't under the control of insurance companies.  They accept health insurance for prescriptions, but they don't get their paycheck from a corporation. So, they generally focus on finding solutions that work for you.\n\nMy doctor recommended Noom to me, and that helped a lot with changing my relationship with food and not beating myself up for eating something unhealthy every once in a while. It costs money, and I know that it can be difficult to decide whether you are willing to pay it, but you have to realize that you are worth the price.  Noom isn't for everyone, and you might have to find something else that works for you.  Just stay away from restrictive weight loss programs. \n\nSlow and steady is how I did it.  It gives you time to really change your eating habits, and it allows your extra skin time to retract.  My thought process was that 1-2 pounds a week is 5 to 10 pounds a month. So in 10 months, I'll have lost between 50-100lbs. and that was true for me.  I'm down to 243, and I feel really good.  I've platued in my weight loss, but I'm still active and a lot stronger than I realized. (So are you. It takes a lot of muscle to run around with so much weight) And I feel healthy.\n\nYou also need a therapist to help you. Weight loss programs only do so much.\n\nI'm not going to give you a verdict. I just want you to know that you are worth it.  You deserve to lose weight.  You deserve to have a healthy relationship with food.  And you deserve to have a better future.", "No judgment here, please don\u2019t give up on your life. You are worthy of kindness and compassion regardless of your weight.

Sometimes, a small change is all that is needed.\n\n100% I understand why you don't want to go.  My mom body shamed me my entire life.  I have an extremely close relationship with my aunt.  She got married for the 1st time when I was in my 30s.  My mom asked me to lose weight before the wedding, so I didn't go.  \n\nI will always regret that I didn't go.  Be there for your parents.

I understand where you're coming from OP, but regardless of your personal (mental not physical) issues, you need to realize that this is an important event that you'd be missing because you're using your anxiety/insecurities as an excuse to not change or push yourself. Get done professional help, and see if you can show up for your parents. If you still can't get past it, at least you tried before giving up immediately.", "NTA\n\nThough you are doing a disservice to yourself, avoiding therapy and becoming further isolated. That can't be making you feel good long term. It can be comforting to stay home because the anxiety of dealing with all the \"what ifs\" outside is taken away when you stay in. But something happens - you start to realise you are missing out on a lot of life. Don't let that become your prison. You'll end up regretting not taking part in your own life and watching time tick away, missing out on experiences.\n\nYou've got to be kind to yourself, I think you've been living with low self-esteem for a long time now. I'm appalled at what your mom said to you, that was not ok. I'm wondering if your mom has said similar things to you in the past, in which case, I am not surprised you turned to something like food to give you comfort the moment you were away from their control and criticism.\n\nI think therapy will help you, you need a support network of friends to keep you uplifted. Not sure how your relationship with your parents are but sometimes telling them when you're going through therapy and what you learned, isn't the best idea because they may deny and retrigger you. If you can work on yourself, just for you, that will do wonders for your mental health.\n\nPlease don't give up on yourself, it's not too late. The wedding is just an event. The most important person is you and looking after yourself and treat yourself kindly. If you want to stay as is, then fine, at least get therapy - for you. If you want to make changes for /yourself/ then you can start slowly and fail as many times. Do it for you, not because of your parents or the wedding. This is your mental health and your health at the end of the day. And I think if they are good people, they should offer you their support.\n\nYou need help right now, not criticism from your parents.

But first informance you have to look up for yourself. \n\nBeing overweight does not mean that you have to be unattractive.

I'm going to tell you something you probably don't believe: your weight is the result of a physical issue with your body and you are not shameful or weak for being fat. The chemical signals for hunger and satiation are complex and not well understood, and if you're eating wildly out of sync with your body's needs, it's because that system is not working properly. \n\nYour body is fine, even if it isn't thin and beautiful. It doesn't work properly in some ways, but that's pretty common in this world. I've got an older body, and one breast is twice the size of the other after cancer treatment.

And you know what? No one cares. Seriously. If some miracle occured and you turn up skinny as hell all that will happen are backhanded compliments because other people feel bad about their own bodies.

It\u2019s hard to make yourself interact with people when you\u2019re uncomfortable in your own skin. But most people really aren\u2019t thinking about you as much as you\u2019re thinking about you. And your situation won\u2019t improve unless you start to make changes. Start small. Track how many calories and exercise you currently get. Cut down the calories by a little more each week. Up the exercise a little more each week. Make it a habit. You will be hungry. It will suck. But it will be worth it and you will feel better in the long run. \n\nFor example if you\u2019re eating 3500 calories a day, and your only exercise is to the car, maybe cut calories to 3000, and take one walk around the block daily for a week. The next week extend that. Cut out one more snack, or shrink one more portion, and maybe go an extra block. Push yourself even though you feel tired, one more step, one more step.

I see new things, sometimes meet new people. Fresh air. And some upbeat music. Sometimes it\u2019s harder than others to focus entirely on the music, but trying to match steps to the beat and maybe a few wiggles I call dancing get me moving without feeling like I\u2019m exercising. I call it distracting my brain. \n\nYou can always reach out to friends or family too to go on walks with you and chat.

Tell them how scared you are and that you need help, and that this was a gut reaction which you couldn\u2019t control due to your own fears. Ask them if they\u2019ll support you as you work through getting your life back. And if they don\u2019t want to understand or support you, be brave and keep asking until you find someone who will stand by you on the journey to a new you. It\u2019s scary but something you won\u2019t ever regret.", "YTA. What your mother said was terrible except I have seen this situation play out too many times to not recognize her words as a last ditch effort to deal with an addict.

I hate giving addicts an AH rating but there aren't a lot of options if they post on AITA. I appreciate you're taking responsibility for your addiction as opposed to being one of those people who blame their parents. I have worked with addicts and the ones who succeed are those who take responsibility and know that they got themselves in this situation and they are the only ones with the power to work on getting out. And it is work. It's not easy. Not everyone succeeds. But it'll be easier now than in 5 or 10 years, and until then, be careful about alienating your support network. It sounds like you're truly hurting your parents by not being there at a special moment, something that was for them and it sounds like you're completely capable of making the gesture except for your insecurities about how you look. That you aren't making the slightest effort to deal with those insecurities is telling them how much they mean to you, and it's a nasty message to send. That is what makes you an AH. This is an illness, and you're not an AH for having it. You're an AH for choosing not to deal with it even though it's causing you to hurt people around you.", "Time for Wegovy or Mounjaro!

You need to speak with someone who can get to the bottom of it, but you won\u2019t likely be in the right mindset in time for the wedding, so you need a plan B for helping you to cope, because you really should be there for them.

I doubt that is actually the case, but rather arises from your already negative feelings about your weight.  There are many good companies who make specifically plus sized clothing that you can order and try on in your own home, or you could find a dressmaker to make something flattering for you.  Also, many department stores have cosmetic advisers who do makeovers for free, (probably in the hope that you will buy something because they are on commission).  An alternative is to find someone who knows what they\u2019re doing with a brush, maybe someone attached to a salon.  This may sound lame to you, but there are many \u201ctransformations\u201d cosmetic channels on YouTube that perfectly illustrate how cosmetics can accentuate the good features and diminish the negative.  You can get a good haircut and colour too, the stylist can advise you on the best styles to frame your face.  Nobody is ugly, but I get the feeling that you have stopped feeling like you are worth it, and don\u2019t treat yourself much because you\u2019ve stopped going out, and you don\u2019t go out because you stopped treating yourself!

There are many reasons that might happen and most of the ones I can think of are related to a dysfunctional home environment. Overeating can be a symptom of deeper psychological problems. Often, it's a way of coping with stress or trauma. Furthermore, it's clear to me that OP lived in a very restrictive environment growing up when it comes to food, and the moment she was no longer in that environment, the overeating spiraled out of control. She never learned the coping mechanisms she needed because her parents always handled it, and/or the restrictive food environment made her so fixated on food that she was unable to cope once those restrictions were lifted.\n\nHonestly though, OP's weight is not the real problem here. The real problem is the *shame* that OP feels over her body, and the changes that it has undergone in recent years. Where could OP have learned that kind of shame, I wonder? Could it have been from the very same parents who are so self-centered they are unwilling or unable to see that their daughter is clearly in crisis? Or perhaps the family and/or \"family friends\" she is so afraid to face at the wedding?\n\nOP, I want you to know that your body is not the source of your worth. You deserve to be treated kindly and with compassion by those around you, no matter what size you are. No, really, I mean it. You could be three times the size you are and still deserve kindness and respect. No one should be treating you so poorly you're afraid to leave your house. Anyone who says they're \"concerned about your health\" is lying, to you and to themselves. How does it help your \"health\" to be shut up inside all the time, afraid to face a world that is cruel to you? How does it help your \"health\" for you to feel so ashamed you can't even bear to go to your parents' wedding?\n\nI think you should attend therapy, as others have stated, but not just for the overeating. There are clearly deeper issues at play here. I think if you dig deep, you might find there are reasons besides your weight that you might not want to go to that wedding.\n\nI don't know what other commenters will make of this response, and frankly I don't care. OP, *you* are the one I'm hoping to reach with this. You deserve so much better than this. No matter what size you are, you deserve to be able to walk out your front door without fear or shame. You deserve to feel the sun on your face and the breeze on your skin. You are part of this world and you *belong* here, no matter what anybody tries to tell you.\n\nNTA, OP. Your struggles are real and genuine and you're not an asshole for having them. You're not \"allowing\" these issues to control you any more than a cancer patient is \"allowing\" their illness to control how they live. We are unavoidably affected by the harm we experience.

She might break a standard venue chair if she does manage to fit into it. That means asking someone for a special chair (if such a thing even exists), drawing more attention to herself. OP doesn't want to be seen and judged by others.\n\nWorse, considering her mother's reaction and words, it is likely how her mother treated her growing up that has directly lead to OP's current bad relationship with food.
