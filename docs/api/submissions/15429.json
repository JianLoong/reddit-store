I almost didn't go visit my sister and my new nephew for the same reasons but I'm really glad I did, although you can't make me look at the pictures of myself, damnit!! I do have nice teeth again so at least I'm, well.. Less self deprecating..", "Info: what are you doing to manage your mental health/weight? \nBut I really think you should go. It\u2019s their wedding. You\u2019re their child and you already agreed to go. Nobody is going to be paying attention to you, but you will regret missing it.", "YTA sorry\n\nI thought this would be because you couldn't afford travel or something. Your insecurity about your weight is valid, but do you genuinely want to miss out on important life events for the people you care about because of it??? You're not being an asshole for letting down your parents you're being an asshole for letting your weight be in charge of your life. You deserve to go to weddings and have fun, wear a nice dress, feel beautiful in the body you're in. Your issues are valid. Do you really want to let them keep controlling you?", "Oh God, this is hard. First, your parents definitely overreacted, at least your mother did. Sure, she's hurt, but you don't hurt your child especially when they are in a vulnerable position, like you were/like you are.\n\nTwo, get to therapy, there certainly is a psychological element to your weight. And your parents are not that nice. Not if they reacted like this. Therapy will help you unravel all of this. \n\nThree... I don't know. This situation is too heartbreaking I don't want to judge, but ok, NTA, but maybe try to see if you can make it to the wedding, it's one night and it will avoid breaking your family apart.", "ESH Your mother was particularly cruel. It was unnecessary. But you are also hurting them by not showing up on the big day. \n\nThe most important part, though, is that you are hurting yourself. \n\nI\u2019ve been where you are. I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s, only 5\u20193\u201d and I\u2019ve spent my whole life struggling with obesity. I\u2019ve been 400 lbs and I\u2019ve been 180. I\u2019m struggling right now to continue my weight loss after gaining a lot back. I have anxiety and depression. It controls my whole life. It sounds like it might control yours too. \n\nMy advice? Don\u2019t avoid living your life. If you want to go to that wedding, go to that wedding. Don\u2019t worry about how you look. Worry about how you feel. If people are rude to you, then walk away. You owe them nothing. You only owe yourself happiness and peace and your parents your support.  \n\nI thought I saw in another comment that you are also avoiding therapy. I\u2019m right there with you. Some advice from someone a little older than you? Don\u2019t wait. It\u2019s scary, I know, and embarrassing, I know, but please take that first step. \n\nYou\u2019re not gross. You\u2019re not ugly. You\u2019re not bad. You are struggling and you are human. And you deserve to live your life like everyone else. \n\nI genuinely wish you luck. Take small steps. Be brave. And don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.", "I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re an AH because I am a recovering food and sugar addict who weighed 300 pounds at 19.So I do understand that it\u2019s hard and difficult and humiliating. But this day is not about you. It\u2019s about them. And they want you there to celebrate them. So NAH but change your mind and go to celebrate them.", "Had an uncle who weighed about the same as you, he often said no to big events for probably the same reason as you. I think he was very lonely. \n\nPlease don\u2019t isolate yourself.  Please don\u2019t be ashamed of who you are. There\u2019s absolutely no way you would be embarrassing anyone by being at the wedding. \n\nYour parents on the other hand should be ashamed of themselves for the way the handle the situation. There reaction should have been \u201cwe are so sorry you feel that way, how can we help you feel better about yourself?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m so sorry but your parents are not lovely people, they\u2019re absolutely horrible. I\u2019ll be surprised if being raised by AH like this is part of why you\u2019re overeating. \n\nPlease do get help with your mental health. You are worth way more respect, than your parents are showing you.", "NAH.   I think you\u2019re totally missing the forest for the trees here.  Your parents wedding is a day to celebrate THEM. Not showing up at their wedding because you\u2019re self conscious about how you look is disrespectful to them and doesn\u2019t change one damn thing about your weight. I understand why they reacted badly.  I also understand why you don\u2019t want to go. It will be awkward, but please do set yourself aside for a few hours to celebrate your parents.   And yes, they do also owe you an apology.", "Oh this is tough\u2026.\nI don\u2019t know you, all I just want to say is that whatever you look like doesn\u2019t matter, your personality is what makes you a nice person to be around. I understand that shame is something that is very hard to deal with, and that you\u2019re afraid of other peoples reactions and opinions. \n\nfighting this monster in your head that is holding you back, is not just defeatable by weight loss.\nThe monster is not YOU. It\u2019s the fear of other people confirming what you are thinking, so the hack would be to change your mindset.\n\nThe real question is: if you were not afraid of other peoples opinions, would you go?\nIf the answer is yes, then please, don\u2019t punish yourself and be there!\nIf the answer is no, then don\u2019t go. But don\u2019t let your fears dictate your actions. You deserve to be happy, despite what other people think.\n\nApart from that it sounds to me that you are having judgement about yourself\u2026.\nDon\u2019t judge, but analize! Wether that means accepting who you are right now, and owning that and being happy, or making changes in your life to become the person you want to be.\nBoth is possible. Really! And that is not about your body, but about your mindset.\nYou can do it! Choose your own happiness :)\n\nWhatever you do, choose you. And allow yourself to choose what makes YOU happy.", "NAH, those are words of anger I'm sure your mother didn't mean it. If you feel like that about yourself then you can start changing your lifestyle, I'm sure a doctor can get you in the right way.", "Your concern about attending is valid. I have relatives who are not well and even they do not feel comfortable at social gatherings for reasons that might not be understandable to other people. For some reason, they are not ready to face people even though these people will likely show them support. \n\nYour parents should have comforted you and alley your fears and tell you how your presence is needed that day because it would mean so much to them. \n\nNot sure why your mother needed to be so nasty. While other redditors say its about them and not about you, i disagree. Sometimes, we expect our parents to be most understanding to our most unreasonable concerns because they would have seen our struggle. Who else will shower such grace to us?", "NTA. Aw mate. I'm sorry. You need support, not your parents berating you. They're hurt and that's understandable, but those comments...ouch. Please don't be embarrassed to reach out for help- some therapists specialise in our relationships with food.", "NTA... you likely have a health problem. It has caused you hurt and anxiety. This doesnt make you evil or a bad daughter. You still deserve love and support while you try to treat yourself with more care. Be kind to yourself, you can't fix your parents lack of empathy.", "I sympathise with you but still, YTA. I totally 100% get why you don't want to be seen. But do you think these family / friends don't already know that you are obese? If they are close enough to you that you value their judgements, then they probably know you well enough to know this.\n\nIf you care about their judgements, then as it stands now, you won't be seen as \"Their daughter who put on a lot of weight\". You'll be seen as \"their daughter who didn't even attend the wedding\", which imo is a lot more negative, and something which can never be changed. If you wanted to put in the effort, you'll be able to lose weight again. But you will never reverse the decision to skip their wedding.\n\nSorry if I come across as rude. Just trying to be honest. I wish you the best with your journey towards good health.", "As a fat guy you are choosing food over family... YTA", "I wish that your parents had reacted with more love than anger, but this is not an AH situation. You mention in a comment that you're neglecting both your mental and physical health. Maybe give your parents the wedding gift of addressing both of these things? It sounds like you are suffering from depression, and I urge you to seek help.", "I feel like this beyond what Reddit\u2019s pay grade but if I have to give a judgment I will say ESH. You TA to yourself because it seems to me like you don\u2019t love yourself and have low-self esteem and rather than do anything about it you\u2019re choosing to hide yourself away. That makes me really sad for you. I would really encourage you to find a therapist because you don\u2019t have to feel like this forever and he/she can help you start to feel better. Your mom is TA for her harsh comment to you and she should apologize. I understand her being upset but that\u2019s no way to talk to her daughter.", "NTA because ultimately you know what's best for you,but you should really seek help to improve your self-esteem, you worth so much than your weight, you shouldn't shut yourself and miss important events in life just because of that. Your parents reaction may come from anger or disappointment for they wished you were here for their celebration, of course, but also maybe because they see you are more and more reclusive and they worry (but your mother was harsh, no doubt).", "NAH but just go to your doctor. There are treatments available, you deserve medical care", "NAH. Everyone is hurting and struggling. I really think you can do this though. We build stuff up in our head until we choose to hide away from it. You have plenty to offer this world but it does start with you leaving that comfort zone. There is love & support all around you, you just have to accept it. \n\nI know it's impossible at times, but all we can do is move forward. Come join r/loseit. It's a super supportive weight loss group of all shapes and sizes. No judgement, just helping eachother to see our goals.", "They have shown you love and support all your life. And you are CHOOSING not to be for them when they want your support. People will tell you what you want to hear, but that's not how reality works. YTA for making this about you. You truly should not be surprised that the people you don't support have finally given up. You hurt their feelings one too many times.", "I think I\u2019m going to get downvoted within an inch of my life, but I\u2019m going to go NTA. It\u2019s sad and honestly, I get entirely where they\u2019re coming from. They love you tremendously or at least I\u2019m assuming they do. You\u2019re their daughter and as a parent, that\u2019s a love that those without kids will never understand. They don\u2019t see 412lbs of \u201cugly\u201d (despite what they said in anger) They see their daughter whom they love. They desperately want you to be a part of the day\u2026. But that still doesn\u2019t make you the asshole. You have valid reasons and it\u2019s understandable why it\u2019s a situation that you\u2019re fairly terrified of. It doesn\u2019t make them assholes either. It\u2019s just a sad situation.", "N A H if your mom had reacted like your dad; NTA because of her comments.\n\nYou\u2019re not attending because of a combination of physical and mental health issues. It\u2019s not a preference; attending would be an undue hardship. So not an A.\n\nIt sounds like your parents were very emotionally invested in you attending. That\u2019s to their credit.  And it\u2019s also quite understandable for this news to be upsetting. They love you and what you to be part of their special day, and have just learned that you won\u2019t be. That\u2019s how your dad seems to have reacted hence the world-be N A H.\n\nBut your mom\u2019s comments are vile. She is channeling her sadness and disappointment in destructive ways and had no right to treat you that way based on her negative feelings. Hence, she\u2019s an A here so N T A", "Esh\n\nYour parents comments were rude. Your mom's in particular were excruciatingly vile.\n\nYou, however, seem too nonchalant for someone who is walking herself to an early grave.", "I'd lean NAH but you're mother definitely overreacted so NTA but this is such a hard story. Your parents are probably worried about you because you're giving up on going to life events and not only that but you said you barely leave your apartment. There's definitely a psychological side to your eating and it probably revolves around depression. The more you eat the more depressed and self conscious you feel, the more self conscious and depressed the more you eat, its a vicious circle. I'd definitely look for some therapy and using this as a motivator to try and lose weight, it seems extremely hard but it's definitely possible. As far as the wedding goes, I'd try to go even if you don't go the whole time, as you said it's people you hardly see, so who gives a shit what they think. Even if you only make the ceremony at least you're there for your parents because they want you there because you're a part of who they are.", "NTA. My sweet you need self-love and self- care,  you deserve better than feeling the way you do.", "NTA. Way to be abusive rather than supportive. If this is how they act I wouldn\u2019t go either. I hope things get better", ">they\u2019re honestly lovely people and the best parents I could ever ask for\n\n>My mom got angry and told me that I\u2019m betraying them, and that I\u2019m going to look like an embarrassment. She told me that I deserve to look like this and she won\u2019t be there to help me when I end up eating myself to death at 40, and that I\u2019ve ruined our relationship.\n\nThose two sentences don't go together.  Loving parents don't say such mean things to their kids.  Does your mom have a history of saying mean and bullying things to you?  Doesn't matter if it's just out of anger, it still has an effect on you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to go to their wedding if they're going to treat you like that. However, if you're feeling unhappy, do something that's going to change that.", "NTA- i do think that being their for your parents special night should trump your fear of potential embarrassment, as i don\u2019t think you have any reason to be embarrassed. nobody is perfect. they love you and i\u2019m sure the rest of your family loves you too, so it shouldn\u2019t matter. you should ask yourself how you would feel if the roles were reversed. if you would be understanding if the roles were reversed, then that settles it, then they should be understanding with you. but if you would not be understanding about it, then that would just be a double standard", "NTA.  The way your parents reacted was totally out of line.  Your motivations are pure, and honestly there's nothing wrong with what you've chosen to do.  On top of that, you're not obligated to attend their wedding regardless of reason.", "NTA.  You were kind and caring enough to explain WHY you don't feel comfortable being there. You could have just said no, but instead you explained yourself and they belittled you and made you feel even worse?  FUCK THEM!\n\nI'm not tiny by any stretch of the imagination and I have absolutely skipped events because I couldn't find something I felt made me look okay enough to be there. Now at 45 I just do and wear what I want and everyone else can fuck off if they don't like it...but i certainly would have been like you just a couple years ago.  Hang in there and if you WANT to lose weight then good on you and you'll figure it out, if not that's okay too, just take care of yourself...physically AND mentally.", "Your NTA.

Life sucks being miserable.", "At my heaviest I felt uncomfortable and judged and found ways to make things work for events because I couldn't miss them due to older family members being in attendance or it was work. \n\nWhat I did was find clothes that were comfortable for me to wear and hid my biggest insecurities  and highlighted my assets. At one point I'd avoid food/liquids that day so I could wear 2-4 pairs of spanx. Darker clothing also helps. \n\nI'm recently 80lbs down and wore colour and something that showed off my arms and I felt great. I still doubled up on the spanx (I will probably never stop) but I felt ok enough to eat and enjoy the party. \n\nYou have time to find something that you feel comfortable with also if you want to, to try and lose some weight. It would be sad to miss an important event, if you're really not able to attend that's ok too.\n\nNTA", "YTA. It's important to them to have you there.

Like you, always big, but it got very bad after high school. I was 21 (this was 12 years ago now) and getting married and I needed her to be my maid of honor. There was no one else who felt right in that role. She shed a LOT of tears trying to find a dress to wear and multiple times told me she wasn't doing it because she didn't want to be looked at, and especially didn't want to be in pictures. She did end up being there (she was actually part of the reason I kept the event small and very limited invite), but she didn't stay long at the reception because her anxiety got quite high. I felt bad to pressure her, but it was also SO important to me that she was there and now it means the world to me to have those photos of her-because she died at age 32. \n\n\nThat all said, I'm going with a very gentle everyone kinda sucks, with the parents being a bit more of the AH, because I understand your parents need to have someone so important in their life at their wedding. BUT, if they really talked to you that way and told you you deserve it and don't want to have a relationship with you, that's awful and I'm sorry. I never would have done that to her. \n\nPlease take care of yourself. It's not too late.", "Oh geeze.  I mean, I sympathize.  I really do.  I hate meeting my family.  I'm afraid they're going to judge me too, for all sorts of reasons.  So I haven't seen my extended family in probably 30 years.  I wouldn't even see my sister if she didn't make the effort to visit me.\n\nI guess the question is, do you want to be like me?  Socially isolated at 45?  Going days without even speaking a single word because you had a couple of days off from work and you didn't interact with a single person?  Because once you start avoiding people, it only snowballs from there.  The more you do it, the easier it is to *keep* doing it, until you've lost all the connections you've ever made.\n\nYour mom was hurt, and so she was hurtful in response.  The thing is, I think you're going to feel awful either way.  I think you'll feel awkward and uncomfortable if you go to the wedding, but I think you'll feel awful and guilty if you don't go.  So if you're going to feel bad about yourself regardless, maybe resist the urge to hide?  \n\nMaybe use this as a wake-up call, that you need to start making a serious change for your heath.  Not for your appearance - for your health.  Your weight is dangerous - I know you know that.  And the effects are going to get worse as you age.  I'm overweight by about 40 pounds, and the older I get, the more I *know* it in my joints.  My knees just... hurt.  I actually had to get physical therapy for them, and there was a point where they told me there was only so much they could do without surgery.  But if I lost weight, it would help a great deal to relieve some of that pressure.  When I run to catch the bus, even if it's just across the street, I get winded.  I have a hard time breathing.  That's really bad.  I know it.  And I need to take better care of my health, to improve my quality of life.  It's not about how I look - it's about how my body feels.\n\nI'm not going to judge anyone here.  Your mom was out of line, maybe she was blindsided and just reacted without thinking.  And there was a kernel of truth in her twisted words - you are more likely to die early because of your weight.  She's probably terrified of losing you.", "YTA yes they overreacted but you can't blame them either if roles were reversed and your mom would not come to your wedding you would be hurt too. \n\nSecondly what you are feeling and what you are doing I have been there and not going outside, no interactions with anyone unless necessary but you know this is not going to help OP. I think you should consult a good doctor and find out why you have an unhealthy relationship with food. I am overweight (just got gastric sleeve, losing little by little) I think my turning point was getting my blood glucose check, knee pains, and felt like dying just by walking. At that point I thought if I don't do anything either I will die or have my elderly parents take care of me. And I wanted none of it.", "NTA... but.. this event isn't about you.  It's a celebration of your parents' love and commitment to each other.  I can see why they are sad and angry about your change of heart... they are feeling like you don't think they are important to them.  They asked you to be there because they love you, and they *want* their child there with them.  They already know what you look like.  I think you should go. \n\nNice clothes don't look bad on people.  Go shopping at a nice store.  Some stores cater to women your size.  Let a personal shopper work with you.  They know how to make people feel good about themselves.  Call ahead to schedule an appointment with someone who has experience in dressing heavy people.  If money is a concern, would your mother help since this is so important to her?   You can also rent nice things for less money than what buying costs.  (You don't even have to buy anything from the shopper... people usually do, but it's perfectly OK to say you need to think about things, and then rent something for less.  They may charge for their time, but not all do.)\n\nHave your makeup and hair done for the occasion.  Go for a practice run a few weeks before if you aren't sure what you want. \n\nTo really dig into things and get better, you need more time than just now through July\u2014but a therapist can help you with some strategies to deal with the social anxiety you have in time for the wedding.  Over time, this will hold you back far more than your weight ever will.  You might consider a very small dose of an anxiolytic.  It will help you not feel so nervous.  Many people need something to help with anxiety in any number of situations.  It's not a crutch or a sign of weakness to treat known conditions so you can function better. \n\nIf you can't stomach the idea of making small talk all night long, go to the wedding and skip the reception.  If someone comments on your weight, say, \"That's really rude,\" and *walk away*.  Nobody can make you feel bad if you don't let them, and practicing this will not only help your self-confidence, it will force people to recognize their own issues.  Do you have a friend you can bring as a plus 1?  That is really helpful in situations like this.\n\nMy dad has a cousin who is really heavy.  She wears bright colors and is in the middle of every picture.  The rest of us are not as heavy, and we understand it's just how things played out for her... but she decided to be comfortable and to enjoy her life.  It was a conscious decision on her part.  \n\nYou are so much more than your weight.  Talk to your parents again about your worries.  Ask them how they can support you so you all can have an enjoyable time.  And, seriously consider the suggestion of attending the ceremony but not the reception.  You deserve a life outside of your apartment. \n\nGood luck.  I hope the best for you.", "I'm not giving judgment.  This is above reddit paygrade.\n\nOP I spent years of my life missing out on events and experiences because of severe, untreated, and out of control agoraphobia.  It controlled my entire life.

I understand it probably sounds different. It isn't.\n\nYou need medical and mental health care. It doesn't sound like you are at the point of wanting that, but i hope you chose to get some soon.
