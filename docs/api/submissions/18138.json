These people that kick out their kids at 18 are unbelievable.", "Hi, OP.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming marriage and a happy life which you owe to yourself and nobody else.\n\nIt's a typical triangulation by parents who have favourite child/children and treat them very differently than you - very much into your face, unapologetically. Then they show entitlement by asking you why on earth they haven't been a part of your wedding planning. And then they shrug it off and tell you to get over it \"because it's in the past\". If they continue this way, they themselves may remain in the past. It hurts me so much to read such stories again and again.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThe people who treat you cruelly always tell you that's \"in the past\" and you have to \"get over it.\"\n\nNo, you don't. Being related to someone you have done harm to is not a Get Out of Jail Free card.\n\nI think you are wrong to invite them to the wedding, though, because they will get in your face and throw a tantrum and ruin the day for your bride.", "You get to decide what type of relationship is healthiest for YOU when it comes to your parents. NTA. You expressed how you felt, and so did they. Doesn't seem like they actually want to take responsibility for making a mistake, but are forcing you to \"get over it.\" They had 16 years to make it right and chose not to. Now they have to answer to family and friends about their involvement in your wedding and are trying to make you look like the bad guy. \n\nI do think it's important to work out these feelings and healthy boundaries in therapy if you haven\u2019t done so already.

This is a 'reap what you sew' situation.", "NTA\n\nI can imagine the hurt when you found out they were paying for the siblings, even going into debt. They fucked up massively. It's nice you sent them an invite and weird they thought they would be part of the planning.", "NTA. They\u2019re getting what they deserve. You can\u2019t treat one of your kids worse than others and expect to be in their life and have good relationships.", "NTA. Was the itemized bill a little much, maybe. But, it sounds like your parents treated your siblings much differently than you and they don\u2019t really want to take responsibility for that. Instead of offering a true apology, they just told you to get over it. I can definitely understand not wanting a real relationship from people who won\u2019t even take responsibility for their actions.", "NTA", "NTA because it\u2019s not about the money, really. The itemized invoice is just a way to show them how they tried to hurt or use you and how you overcame. \n\nThey likely saw how this plan of theirs failed, and didn\u2019t do it for the younger ones. HOWEVERRR, they had plenty of time to apologize, explain, try to right their wrongs. $500 for a room/board 16 years ago is full price and the money they gave you only would have helped for 10 months. Moving out was the right choice.", "NTA my husband is in a similar situation and he is asking for reparations.", "NTA. Yes, what happened was in the past. I hate that cliche because it overlooks the main issue-we are formed from our past. Our past experiences shape us. OP, your past includes parental abandonment. Everything you have accomplished you did on your own. You owe your parents nothing, up to and including a wedding invitation. You were nicer to your parents than you even needed to be.", "NTA. You reap what you sow. And the fact that THEY took out loans to help your siblings, but basically threw you out, is outrageous. They should be happy you are even inviting them", "NTA. Good for you! They realized their mistakes but never address them with you it sounds like. Even if you forgive, that doesn't mean you'll ever forget.", "NTA. But like love, forgiveness can't be bought, so even if they did cough up, would it alleviate the hurt you felt?\n\nI'm the eldest of two, and I can empathise with how you feel. My parents were MUCH easier on my brother than with me, and I resented them for years.\n\nMy brother borrowed \u00a3150 from them and took months to pay it back. I borrowed \u00a310 from my mum, and she demanded it back the next day.\n\nI was told when I left school at 16 I had to get a job or go to college (High School to you). I was on a really low wage (it was like an apprentice scheme) and I had to pay rent. My brother flunked school, sat around on his arse playing computer games for a year, eventually went to college, flunked that, went to another college, and flunked that too. \n\nI could go on. \n\nMy parents have worked hard to build bridges, and make up for their mistakes, and this is where your parents need to meet you halfway. The financial impact not withstanding, the emotional impact needs addressing so they and the rest of your family understand why you feel the way you do.\n\nCongrats on making a success of your life and with your wedding!", "NTA. The itemized bill could be considered petty but fuck them. It\u2019s not about the money you had to work and go to school so instead of fixing your relationship they just treated your siblings much better.

Pffffft! Gtfo. Also, the double standard on how OP was treated vs. the siblings, is too great to overlook. Totally NTA.", ">... they made mistakes when I was young bet that it was in the past and that I should get over it.\n\nConvenient how they skip the whole moving forward and working together to build a healthier relationship and go straight to \"get over it\" and playing happy families for the public.", "NTA. You got the short end of the stick and now way after they want to make up. Too little too late.", "NTA.\n\nEven withlut everything else, people who say \"a lot of time has passed you should have forgiven me\" are assholes by default.", "NTA. I'm gonna bet that they'll soon ask you for money to help with their debt.", "NTA. Always found it interesting how older adults never seem to apologize, they \"acknowkledge\" but then tell you to get over it. You know that if you wronged them, you would never hear the end of it. Way to call out the hypocrisy and congrats on the wedding!", "NTA\n\nI would say though the sending them an itemised bill was a bit much. At the end of the day nothing they can do or say is really going to make up for all that time, but biting back is likely to make them but more importantly you feel worse about it all, adding to the heap as it were. \n\nProbably better draw the boundaries of what you want the relationship to be with them and just doggedly stick to it, politely and calmly. Either they get on board or they don't. You sound happy for either outcome.", "They want to be a part of your life they can earn their keep by actually making an effort to be in your life. If they truly felt this way, what stopped them from trying before your wedding? What is to say they won't immediately go back to ignoring you until your next big life event? \nI probably wouldn't have sent them the bill you did, but I do think they deserved to be humbled by it and remember all the hardship they have put you through by not being the support system everyone needs at times. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding I hope you and your SO have one of the greatest days of your life.\n\nNTA", "You beauty. What a response and how deliciously cutting. Positively oozing disdain. I commend and congratulate you on it.\n\nPersonally, I'd have sent them the same bill as an entrance ticket to the wedding but perhaps that's being too mean\n\nNTA in my book. Enjoy your wedding and the rest of your life.\n\nBTW, what will you charge them to see your first child? Hee hee hee.", "NTA. You should forgive them and move on. It sounds like you have the moving on part covered but are still resentful. And fully justified in that resentment in my opinion. But for yourself just let the past go. You don't need them or the shit they did to you affecting your present and future.", "Isn't it amazing how quickly the people who treated you like shit are willing to let you forgive them? I swear to God. As a mother of 3 who are all now grown I would have never attempted what your parents just did. But then again I know when i've done something shitty and i'm willing to admit it...and make up for it.\n\nETA. NTA", "\"I acknowledge mistakes were made when you were young, you need to move on,\" is NOT the same thing as, \"We screwed up when you were young and we're sorry for it.\"  In fact it is the siren song of the assholes who think that they were totally in the right to heavily favor their other children.\n\nLike... even if they'd wanted to have the kind of close-knit relationship with adult you that they claim to... what the hell have they been up to for the last 16 years?  We're three presidents in and they haven't taken any opportunity to say sorry, to reach out and try and interact with you, nothing?\n\nYou're NTA.  You offered them a wedding invitation, which is kind of you.", "NTA, and I'm sorry they treated you that way. It's one thing if they did that to all their kids but they singled you out and then let it go on for 16 years. Build your own family and show them how it's supposed to be done.", "NTA. I wouldn't have even invited them to the wedding. Congrats on the nuptials, enjoy your life!", "NTA", "NTA and the flying monkeys are laughable.", "NTA - they are learning an important lesson, sometimes you can\u2019t undo the things you did too your your children. Have a great wedding!.", "NTA As it stands, you've paid for their lessons in parenthood. If they want to claim their position as parents, they get to pay you back.", "NTA - You are actually very well adjusted given their abandonment. Was the itemized bill a little petty? Yes. But it\u2019s better than much stronger and unhealthy emotions. They are lucky they got a wedding invitation. If they keep acting up rescind the invitation and build your best life with new family and friends.\n\nCongrats on the marriage!", "NTA - but did you send your bank details along with the bill? Because if you didn\u2019t, there is no way for them to pay if they change their mind. I would send a revised bill along with payment details\n\nIf they keep harping on about no money, then tell them to sell the house or get your siblings to pony up.\n\nHope it all works out for you", "I was honestly a little thrown by this one because my parents started charging me rent after I graduated high school, so not long after I turned 18. They had not saved up anything for my college education. They also collected rent from my older siblings but gave it back in the fall when they started college. They did not return the money to me. They refused to cosign any loans or fill out any paperwork for all of us older kids but did so for the youngest. So when I saw they charged you rent but gave you a lump sum, I just thought it was weird. When you said they did more for younger kids, I just assumed their circumstances changed or they felt bad. I'm not saying have a relationship with them. I am LC with my mom. It just seems weird to send them an itemized bill after they did give you some money. I don't know.", "NTA. I like your creativeness in setting down boundaries. I would have just cut them all off.", "NTA.", "NTA. They made their choice and you\u2019ve made yours in return.

You even made the effort to invite them to be the bigger person, and they still complained about not being involved. That was asking for you to tell them exactly why.", "NTA. Forcing your kid out of the house at 18 like it's a magic number is a dick move.", "Definitely NTA!", "NTA. Parents deserve the consequences of their actions. You learned to live on your own, so that\u2019s how you planned your wedding. They need to get over it and accept their place in your life.", "NTA but consider listening to your Fianc\u00e9e. I think this grudge will hurt you more in the long term, but it\u2019s your life, so do with it what you will. Perfectly within your rights.

I hope you get to heal. And congrats on your wedding, glad it all worked out despite your parents choices. Could have easily gone sideways..", "NTA", "NTA at all, and I love that you gave them a clear outline of  \"how much exactly\" they haven't been in your life. If only they had truly apologized from the heart, but no, you are the one who has to get over it. The nerve. I'm glad you sent it.", "NTA\n\nSure maybe the bill was a bit much but they obviously held you and your siblings to much different standards.

I am trying hard to to end up on here personally.", "Honestly NTA\u2026 I would absolutely do the same thing for some people who took better care of my siblings (not my parents btw)", "NTA. I would love to do this to my dad, he threw out tons of my stuff without asking and took my college funds to pay for vacation, this would feel so good", "NTA. They asked questions they weren't prepared to have answered. They are experiencing natural, proportional concequences for their actions.", "NTA.  They're the ones that burned that bridge and rebuilding bridges isn't free.  In this case the cost is real money.  They should be grateful you're inviting them at all instead of just treating them as the very distant relatives they chose to make themselves.", "NTA. An invitation to a life event is not a right, much less greater participation. You are a fair person.", "Yeah it was a harsh response, but they opened the door and you just walked through it and handed them their symbolic comeuppance. They\u2019re TAH.

Nah.", "NTA", "NTA.  They reap what they sow.  I wouldn't have even invited them to my wedding if I was in your position.  Your parents did this to themselves, you owe them nothing at all.

And it\u2019s not like you are actually asking for the money. It\u2019s more of a f u.

For your parents, the consequences are that you feel like a lower priority and won't prioritize them.", "NTA - This guy!  I love this guy.  Well played, old son!

I sure they can get money again if they really do want to patch things with OP.", "Wait. Where were all of those family members when your parents were taking advantage of you? I\u2019d ask them how many times they called my parents to tell them they weren\u2019t being fair.", "ESH\n\nThey gave you money for your education and didn't kick you out, so it feels overly precious for you to claim financial orphanhood and say you were utterly abandoned. \n\nTheir behavior actually sounds pretty normal and healthy.\n\n Unless there is something else you're leaving out (were they charging you an insane amount of rent? Did you actually *want* to live at home your entire college career? Did need to move back at any time and they said no? Or did you ever tell them you had no money for food/utilities and they said tough? Did they refuse to help you sort housing and scholarship stuff, even when you asked and said you needed help?) I am failing to see where they actually treated you poorly.\n\nYou sound petty and score keeping. You definitely hold on to grudges in unhealthy ways for far, far too long. Maybe work on fixing that before it wrecks either your marriage or your other relationships (maybe with your own kids?) sometime in the far future", "YTA. They paid for a chunk of your education and you\u2019re still mad?", "ESH. \n\nYou're clearly pretty bitter, and I'm not going to judge that. On the other hand, your parents gave you a big chunk of cash and you moved out. You know what most of us get when we move out of age 18 or 19? Not much. Basically nothing. I'll admit though in my case, I had the choice, but if I'd stayed at home I would have been nothing. \n\nSo your parents clearly could have done more to help you, and if they had the capacity should have, and they probably should have made better efforts to reach out to you afterwards. It's not unreasonable that you didn't make them a big part of your life, and that you need to make them a big part of your wedding. \n\nBy sending them the bill like that was kind of petty. You could have just said \"you chose not to help when I was younger, you haven't been a major part of my life, so this is what happens. You're welcome to come to my wedding but I'll be obviously since you didn't financially contribute to my life (I mean aside from what sounds like a decent chunk of money they gave you... Which again is something most of us don't get), if you want to be more involved in the wedding you should be helping to pay for it like parents do\"\n\nSending and itemized bill just sounds and feels petty. Was it unreasonable? Maybe not. But on the other hand you got to grow up, you have a good job, you have a good life, you're about to get married, and you're pissed off because your parents didn't pay your way, and your siblings got more than you.\n\nYou don't have to bring the major parts of your life, but it sounds like you're acting petty, and no one ever comes out on top by acting petty.

It about how you spend and finding ways to save.", "I got accepted to a Christain university I never applied to on my birthday", "It\u2019s good that you finally know the tooth.", "If the tooth is not wearing a Santa hat, you should write \"return to sender\" on the envelope, because they're clearly not even trying. You want to drill my teeth, you better jingle ALL THE WAY.", "^ This. OP got kicked out during the Housing market crash... OP's parents are shitty for sure. And unrepentant. I wouldn't have invited them to my wedding. I regret having people who were trash at my wedding because it makes it harder to look at my wedding album.", "Exactly - let's not act like the parents are so kind and generous for giving him $5,000, and then charging him $500 a month in rent.  They were getting their money back from him one way or another.", "Notably a 10 month timer if he spent Zero of that money on school.  Quick search says \"For the 2007-08 collegiate year, textbooks and supplies were estimated to cost a student between $805 and $1,225\"  that's Just the books.", "Yup, yup, yup - I agree with you 100%.  He even said he didn't really want the money back - it was more to make a point, and was a catharsis.  I absolutely agree with all of that now.\n\nAnd agree with you about SAH moms.  It's THE hardest job in the world.", "But you have to remember that in the US, Uni *costs*, as does healthcare, you have to have a car to get most places because public transit doesn't exist, and all other 'safety nets' are means-tested into near uselessness and often take *years* to get, if you ever can.", "Oh wow, they gave him a little money that clearly wasn't enough. \ud83d\ude44\n\nWhile also kicking him out and saying that he was getting exactly zero help from them after that point and leaving him to figure out how to pay for the rest of it alone.", "I share it with the Major League Baseball trade deadline. :'(", "That sucks so much and is all too common. It\u2019s exactly the reason we always make a big deal out of separating my nephew\u2019s birthday from Christmas. He was born on the 26th and he\u2019s 28 now.

She hardly supported what *I* wanted to do when I was young, always favoring my younger brother and sister. Then I moved out and struggled to survive on my own (abusive roommate, low paying job, still in school with tons of loans) and she found out from someone else that I had gone to a food bank because we couldnt afford our bills and buy food. THAT'S when she realized she fucked up. she, in a sort of scolding way, told me I shouldnt have gone to a food bank because she would always help me out. Then I of course tested it. I couldn't bear to live with my roommate anymore so I asked to move back home. was welcomed back and given my own room (before I shared with my sister) and didnt have to pay any rent or bills or anything. so after all that acting like she wanted to throw me out and fend for myself, she backtracked and actually took care of me when I was at my lowest point. now I'm still not super successful but I own my own house and am fully independent, and its because she actually helped like she said she would. we still talk every week and were super close now. \n\nOPs parents never realized where they went wrong until this wedding invite situation. absolutely shit parents. cant even make a small attempt to rekindle a relationship with him because they have all these excuses. OP was SUPER nice to invite them to his wedding. unfortunately they havent learned anything. I do hope they come to support his wedding, since he said he wants that, but I doubt they will support him with anything else. sucks but it sounds like hes doing great on his own despite their attempts. \n\nOP, best wishes for your wedding!! hope its everything you want it to be!! :D", "This. When my oldest was accepted to one of the top universities in our country, in one of the highest COL locations in our country, we were poor poor. Like filing for bankruptcy and possibly losing our house poor. We are in a MUCH better position now to help our other kids. However, since then, I paid for her masters program, and after she lost her job and went through a bad breakup, she's living back at home rent free and saving so that she can buy her own house and pay off the student loans she had to take on. Sometimes you can't be there the way you want to for your oldest, but that doesn't mean you can't make up for it when you are in the position to be there for them later down the road.", "I have a similar story. Thoughts are with ya and parents should know better.", "Or at least a portion of the wedding. They really should have started with that.\n\n\"We received an invitation and we are so excited to be included on your big day. Is there anything we can do to help?\"", "My husband and I were paying $600 for a whole house with a garage in 2007. Yes, it was a small house, but we had the entire space.

And you know damn well they would have expected him to do chores, too.", "In a further out extension of FW, TX, $500 was just below half my mortgage(with escrow for taxes/insurance) on a 2000 sq ft home around the 2007 timeframe. There were apartments, in ok areas, that could be had for close to that as well. Nicer areas the rent was a bit more.", "I'm on disability,  $1200 a month.   Mother charges $600 for rent, plus utilities.  I can't afford to buy groceries for the entire month.  \"Mother\" has always put $$$ first.", "I was paying $525 for a fully furnished one bedroom in 2005. In 2007, $950 rented us a three bedroom, two bath house with a big yard. In a relatively expensive city. No way should *anyone* have been paying more than half of that to live in one room, let alone to continue living in their childhood bedroom.", "Location is important. In '07 i was renting a 3 bedroom with basement and garage for $900", "They didn't kick him out, OP took it upon himself to move. And where does OP say that they wouldn't have helped them at all?", "I mean, to be entirely honest, they are lucky they got any money at all. They werent entitled to it in the first place in my opinion. Most people have to go and make their lives when they enter adulthood. Yes the help from parents is nice, but I dont think that's required at all. I had emotional support from my single mother, but I had no financial support whatsoever when I moved out.", "OMG, is that the original site? It might be! You win the OG internet today. LOL!!", "I'd take the money, then walk away.", "If circumstances change, then you should find some way to help the older child out.

But I remember the bills coming in the mail separately - one for tuition and one for housing and the meal plan.  And my dad would send the payments for those when they arrived, because they had to be paid before the semester started.\n\nAnd then as far as books and supplies, they didn't send a bill - they sent a list of the books I'd need for that semester, and the cost of the book if it was purchased new (*you could find them used from the year before unless the new editions were very different - everyone normally shopped for books once we got to campus, so a few days before classes started*).  My dad would send me money, I'd deposit it in my checking account, and then write out a check (*we still did that back then!*) when I got to the register at the school store."]}
