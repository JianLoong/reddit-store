We\u2019ve set a lot of unpopular boundaries with everyone. One boundary that was set was to call before coming over to our house because my husband is gone during the day and sometimes the baby and I will nap throughout the day if we didn\u2019t get much sleep the night before, which happens often. We communicated this clearly to everyone. \n\nHis family didn\u2019t try to come over in the first few weeks, but after then, they would come over at random times and called once when they were 5min away. Of course, I was asleep each time they tried (they tried about 3 times), so I couldn\u2019t let them in because I was asleep and had no idea they were here. His family was hurt by this.\n\nHis mom only comes by now when my husband is coming home from taking his older sister home from medical treatment because his mom picks her up and takes her back home from our house. She will usually just wait out in the car until he gets back and won\u2019t come in when he does get here. She\u2019ll make an excuse like, \u201cI\u2019ve been sick,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired, so I just want to go home.\u201d My husband is mad at me for this, but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. We told her just knock when she got here so I could let her in, but she just refuses to get out of her car. \n\nHis family is also upset that I apparently don\u2019t let them hold our baby. I have never rejected someone in his family when they asked to hold the baby, I always happily hand her off when someone asks. After all, I want her to bond with her family. My husband said tonight that I should offering. It never even crossed my mind that I should be offering. I love holding our baby. Offering isn\u2019t really a huge thing in my family. \n\nTo add to the fire, I brought along my mother to my husband\u2019s sister\u2019s quincea\u00f1era about a month ago and we all had fun, but they noticed that my mother was holding the baby a lot. My mom is constantly asking to hold her anytime she sees our baby, and like I said, I don\u2019t say no when people ask. His family took this personally and didn\u2019t even try to really interact with our baby after that.\n\nMy husband and I ran into his mom today and he asked her if she wanted to hold the baby. She rejected the offer and she voiced that she feels unwelcome in our home and was upset about my mother holding the baby at the quincea\u00f1era when she didn\u2019t get to hold her at all, but she didn\u2019t even try to. My husband took her side, which really hurt. \n\nAll of these concerns were voiced to me all at once tonight. So, I didn\u2019t have context while they were happening. I don\u2019t want to have problems with him or his family. They have actually done a lot for me. Maybe I\u2019m giving off a weird vibe somehow to them - I know I can be super socially awkward, but I feel like my actions with my family vs his have been virtually the same. I just don\u2019t see how this could lead to them feeling so uncomfortable or unwelcome.", "created_utc": 1697629287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17aoowd/aita_for_inlaws_feeling_unwelcome_in_our_home/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband needs to step up and help with this social awkwardness instead of siding against you. He should be asking his parents if they want to hold the baby, he should be making sure they are comfortable. And as for anyone dropping by when you have told everyone you and baby might be napping\u2014that is completely stupid. Do your in-laws really not remember what it was like to be up all night with a little one?  If your MIL actually wanted to hold the baby, she would have jumped on it the minute her son asked her to. Instead she pouts to get some kind of leverage over you, and sympathy and attention from HER baby\u2014a son who isn't acting like a grown man here\u2014and he's giving that to her.", "It sounds like no one here is respecting you. Thats a major issue. NTA", "Your husband's family are a gaggle of drama queens.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou have a husband problem as well as weirdly entitled in-law problems. \n\nHE should be the one taking all the  heat for anything  related to you and your baby viv-a-vis his family. He should  also be taking the lead. And if he had, he wouldn't need to take the heat.", "All of the issues that your in-laws are experiencing are OF THEIR OWN MAKING! You are NTA!\n\nYou asked them not to stop by without calling ahead. They came anyway and are upset that you didn\u2019t break your boundary\u2026.or read their freaking minds.\n\nThey think you should offer your baby to them. That\u2019s\u2026just a creepy way of handling a baby. Hey\u2026.ya wanna hold my kid? No, not how that works. \n\nYour husband? He needs to get with the program. He is not home alone with the baby. He doesn\u2019t get to decide what you do while you are!", "NTA you MIL sounds like she\u2019s having a pity party.", "NTA for calling before arriving.  That's pretty normal and courteous. \n\n If you just show up, you cannot expect anything as nobody has been notified and who knows what's gong on at that time, or even if someone is home.", "NTA\nNOBODY should be calling to your house unannounced, that's doubly true when you have a baby to look after.  So they were in the wrong for doing that and they were even more wrong to continue doing it after you set a boundary. Your husband is the real Ass here. He should be clearly communicating to his family that they are not to disturb you during the day and to arrange visits when he is home. As for holding the baby, you aren't a mind reader,  family should ask to hold the baby.  I don't hand my babies over because I love cuddling them, you only get a cuddle if you ask!  Your husband is a big issue here,  he should be supporting you.", "What do they mean by offering? So everytime his family is around they want you to go up to each of them and say.. \" hold my baby please?\" \n\nNTA. You have the right to set boundaries and they need to respect them. Your husband is definitely TA here.", "Info \u2014 what exactly is your husband asking you to do? Why can\u2019t he do it?", "You have a husband problem, his family expects you to be a mind reader, they don\u2019t ask for what they want but you are somehow just expected to know they\u2019re at the door or that they want to hold the baby? Your husband needs to fix this, its his family, he is the one to make them stop disrespecting his wife and his child. Honestly, what kind of grandparents are cold to an infant because they have an issue with the parent?", "NTA\n\nTo put it quite simply, your MIL has decided that these perceived slights and her own feelings about them matter more to her than her grandchild.

But to ice out your DIL and grandchild for *months* because they were *asleep* is ridiculous. These people *had* at least one baby, but even if they didn't, everyone knows it's exhausting. \n\nBut your real concern here should be your husband.", "Your husbands family needs to get a grip.

Pouting because you, (at first), didn\u2019t offerer your MIL the baby to hold, (what, Is the woman mute that she couldn\u2019t ask?), and *then refusing* to hold the baby, *when offered*-is patently ridiculous. \n\nNTA And this is your husbands family. He needs to straighten them out. And defend you. Damn. You have my sympathies.", "NTA.   his family was  hurt  because you didn't let them visit with 5 minute notice they were  coming?\nWell too effing bad...   it's  rude to drop in by surprise.", "You all need to sit down and hash this out before it gets worse.

Not everyone wants to hold a baby and a lot of people have no idea how to hold/handle a baby. People get excited and act weird. And most people will just say yes coz you asked.. I mean no one wants to be rude to a new mom. And your husband needs to understand that. \n\nAlso you mentioned you don't want problems coz they have done a lot fo you. That's great. But that doesn't mean they can just barge into your house whenever they like or throw tantrums when they are asked to back off. If they did it out of the goodness of their hearts then you owe them nothing.."]}
