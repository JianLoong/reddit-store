We\u2019ve set a lot of unpopular boundaries with everyone. One boundary that was set was to call before coming over to our house because my husband is gone during the day and sometimes the baby and I will nap throughout the day if we didn\u2019t get much sleep the night before, which happens often. We communicated this clearly to everyone. \n\nHis family didn\u2019t try to come over in the first few weeks, but after then, they would come over at random times and called once when they were 5min away. Of course, I was asleep each time they tried (they tried about 3 times), so I couldn\u2019t let them in because I was asleep and had no idea they were here. His family was hurt by this.\n\nHis mom only comes by now when my husband is coming home from taking his older sister home from medical treatment because his mom picks her up and takes her back home from our house. She will usually just wait out in the car until he gets back and won\u2019t come in when he does get here. She\u2019ll make an excuse like, \u201cI\u2019ve been sick,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired, so I just want to go home.\u201d My husband is mad at me for this, but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. We told her just knock when she got here so I could let her in, but she just refuses to get out of her car. \n\nHis family is also upset that I apparently don\u2019t let them hold our baby. I have never rejected someone in his family when they asked to hold the baby, I always happily hand her off when someone asks. After all, I want her to bond with her family. My husband said tonight that I should offering. It never even crossed my mind that I should be offering. I love holding our baby. Offering isn\u2019t really a huge thing in my family. \n\nTo add to the fire, I brought along my mother to my husband\u2019s sister\u2019s quincea\u00f1era about a month ago and we all had fun, but they noticed that my mother was holding the baby a lot. My mom is constantly asking to hold her anytime she sees our baby, and like I said, I don\u2019t say no when people ask. His family took this personally and didn\u2019t even try to really interact with our baby after that.\n\nMy husband and I ran into his mom today and he asked her if she wanted to hold the baby. She rejected the offer and she voiced that she feels unwelcome in our home and was upset about my mother holding the baby at the quincea\u00f1era when she didn\u2019t get to hold her at all, but she didn\u2019t even try to. My husband took her side, which really hurt. \n\nAll of these concerns were voiced to me all at once tonight. So, I didn\u2019t have context while they were happening. I don\u2019t want to have problems with him or his family. They have actually done a lot for me. Maybe I\u2019m giving off a weird vibe somehow to them - I know I can be super socially awkward, but I feel like my actions with my family vs his have been virtually the same.

You\u2019ve run bang smack into \u201cAsk\u201d versus \u201cGuess\u201d culture:\n\n>\u201cThis is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture.\n\n>In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.\n\n>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.\n\n>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.\n\n>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.\n\n>Obviously she's an Ask and you're a Guess. (I'm a Guess too. Let me tell you, it's great for, say, reading nuanced and subtle novels; not so great for, say, dating and getting raises.)\n\n>Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior. Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at (pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone.\u201d \n\nFrom [here](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421) and a useful summary in the Guardian [here](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser)\n\nBasically you are supposed to \u201cguess\u201d what your husband\u2019s family wants, so that you can then delicately offer them what they wanted. You are used to being asked in a straightforward way, and are feeling resentful at these shenanigans. \n\nYour husband\u2019s family think you are a heartless unfeeling wench for not having guessed that they want to be offered the baby to hold, and are now actively whinging about it. Things must be bad for them to have actually had to directly state what they want, directly to your face. \n\nUnder any other circumstances, I think you\u2019d find this funny, but you\u2019ve just had a baby and understandably have very little extra energy for the level of telepathy your husband\u2019s family requires. \n\nAs *he* comes from this culture, why not get *him* to run the telepathic interference ? He can guess away at what his family is hinting at, and proffer the baby at suitable intervals to appease his mother. You could even have an extra nap while all this hinting and guessing is going on. \n\nAs you can probably tell, I\u2019m an asker and find the whole thing preposterous; but given that this really does sound like a cultural difference, it can be easily solved by letting him run interference with his family. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nPeople who don't communicate what they want and expect you to guess are a plague on society.

The first person you need to set straight is your husband. YOU ARE NOT A MIND READER. It is not on you to anticipate everyone else's unspoken wishes and desires. It's on THEM to communicate, and ask for things. They are responsible for their own mistaken assumptions, and their own choices and actions! I'm guessing that their broken-communication pattern has been going on for so long, that your husband sees it as 'normal', accepts that it is permissible, and that's why he sides with them. It may take a lot of 'reality checks' to fix this, maybe even a marital counselor so he can hear it from a Third party!  Then he needs to set his Mother and the rest of the family straight. This one bad dynamic is going to create a lifetime of problems for you and your relationships.", "INFO: What other \u201cunpopular boundaries\u201d have you set?

You don't owe anyone YOUR baby.", "I think what has happened here is that your in-laws were uncomfortable with your rule that they needed to call first before visiting. Your rule was entirely reasonable but for whatever reason they felt unwelcome. Probably your husband should have coupled this rule with invitations of his own for his family to come visit the baby at times he was home. But he didn't do that. As a result, your in-laws showed up with little notice a few times and were unable to see the baby because you were asleep. Hence they became uncomfortable around you, I think that's why they don't feel comfortable asking you if they can hold the baby. \n\nI agree with others that what you have is a husband problem. It was good that your husband agreed with your rule of asking people to call first before visiting, but it sounds like he didn't combine that with proactive attempts to include his family, by setting up visits for times he'd be home, or by giving them the baby to hold. \n\nThe quinceanera. Why was your mom there? Was she invited? It doesn't sound like your mother is good friends with your in-laws. Aren't quincaneras usually quite fancy? Is it normal for a sister-in-law's mother to attend? I am wondering if you might have made a bit of a faux-pas there. \n\nYour baby is 9 months old now, old enough to have her own relationship with her grandparents. You don't have to hold her all the time and there is still time to develop a nice relationship between her and your in-laws if your in-laws are decent people who would be trustworthy grandparents. But it will probably require some help from you as your daughter will look to you to see if these people can be trusted.", "Why not invite the in-laws over when your husband is home? Plan lunch and when MIL comes over, you hand off the baby (I am so busy, would you be so kind as to hold baby Bee while I get things done? Yes? My hero!). Make it a regular thing - second Saturday of the month, or however your schedule and their's works.", "NAH except maybe for your husband for not having  your back.\n\nYou say you don't understand why they feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, but you've explained exactly why they feel that way. That sort of means you do understand, you just think they shouldn't feel that way. Go out and invite your MIL in when she comes to the house. Don't take no for an answer. Tell her that you feel horrible (you obviously do) that she feels the way she does, and you want to do everything in your power to make her feel more welcome and comfortable. Offer the baby to them to hold. You don't get it, and that's fine, but they likely think it's rude to ask. It costs you nothing to offer and will solve that problem. In the end, there are some very simple things you can do to alleviate a lot of the tension.", "These expectations are ridiculous. They sound like immature communicators. Your husband needs to take the rein on this, you\u2019re the team here; it\u2019s not his family vs you. Sadly a lot of men have trouble grasping this, especially when mommy is angry/sad/disappointed/whatever.", "Everyone needs to calm down here, posters too. What good comes from letting these bad feelings fester? Come on. It is time to reset this. I easily took my baby granddaughter from my daughter. If the baby needed a new diaper or bottle, I just did it. She spit up on her outfit? I put a new one on the baby.  I was way more cautious with my DIL. Always asked if it was OK to take the baby.  Would you like me to change her diaper? Can I heat up a bottle? Always asked, before acting.  I was fearful of overstepping. I didn't want to look pushy or overbearing. \n\nThis is a small thing to say... \"Would you like to hold her?\" MIL may not feel comfortable asking after the drop by and see you fiascos. And yes, they **should** have called like you asked. You and his family have definitely gone off the tracks. Calm all of this down. It's gotten awkward, so help fix it. Just help. Don't take the full responsibility. This is new to all of you. Husband too. Find out how all of you can restart. \n\nMaybe you don't want some a sit down talk and action plan. I'm that way. If  I were you, the next time MIL is pouting in the car, I take that baby too her. I'd say, \"Baby, look it's grandma (or whatever name you use for her). It's so nice to see her. Hi grandma!\" I would do it every week. I wouldn't care if MIL kept the window rolled up and door closed. When it's too cold or rainy, text g'ma. Tell her you won't be able to bring the baby outside today and you hope she has time to come in. You can only control your actions. A small kindness may be met with a positive response.

We have a lot miscommunication, it\u2019s to a point now, were we as a family just don\u2019t really bother with my brother and new family. This has caused a lot resentment and hurt feelings.\n\nMy suggestion to you is communicate.

As for the baby make an effort to ask them if they\u2019d like to hold them when they are around. Make it clear you WANT them to hold the baby.

I've never heard this laid out like this, and it exactly describes my family and how I was raised. We are Guessers to the extreme. You never ever ever ask for something - that is rude, placing a burden on whoever your asking, and so presumptuous. It's very uncomfortable for me when people ask for things straight out because for more than 40 years I've had it drilled into my head that it's a completely inappropriate thing to do. This is definitely going to be rattling around in my head now and I'll bet I see it in so many different aspects now!", "I was waiting for that comment. This is typical Guess behaviour.

She doesn\u2019t need his whole family acting like children to add to it", "No kissing the baby was the most unpopular boundary. Don\u2019t want to risk it with RSV/COVID/Flu/cold sores. \n\nYeah, they knocked, but I put white noise for the baby, so I never heard them knock.", "I agree with you. While I don't think I would go so far as to say the OP is an AH, I think she is being rather thoughtless, like she doesn't care about her in-laws much. You have to make an actual effort so your in-laws feel like they're included. That means making sure they get time with the baby. Husband is doing it for her folks. She should be doing it for his.", "Couldn\u2019t agree with you more.", "What point? Think a bit to determine why that changed. Do you care enough to do so?", "They didn\u2019t though. They didn\u2019t call in advance, and when they did and I didn\u2019t answer because I was asleep, they came by anyway and were mad that I didn\u2019t wake up to the sound of them knocking on the door.  \n\nThey always used to ask to hold the baby and they just asked less and less.

Reasonable thought process. Calling with 5 minutes notice and then getting butthurt because there\u2019s no answer is asinine and beyond unreasonable to blame OP for. The answer to that is simple. OP didn\u2019t answer the phone, they must be indisposed and now might not be a good time to visit. Getting mad at OP for not being available at your whim is unreasonable. Add to that suddenly wanting to be asked if you\u2019d like to hold the baby? Here\u2019s how that goes.
