We\u2019ve set a lot of unpopular boundaries with everyone. One boundary that was set was to call before coming over to our house because my husband is gone during the day and sometimes the baby and I will nap throughout the day if we didn\u2019t get much sleep the night before, which happens often. We communicated this clearly to everyone. \n\nHis family didn\u2019t try to come over in the first few weeks, but after then, they would come over at random times and called once when they were 5min away. Of course, I was asleep each time they tried (they tried about 3 times), so I couldn\u2019t let them in because I was asleep and had no idea they were here. His family was hurt by this.\n\nHis mom only comes by now when my husband is coming home from taking his older sister home from medical treatment because his mom picks her up and takes her back home from our house. She will usually just wait out in the car until he gets back and won\u2019t come in when he does get here. She\u2019ll make an excuse like, \u201cI\u2019ve been sick,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired, so I just want to go home.\u201d My husband is mad at me for this, but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it. We told her just knock when she got here so I could let her in, but she just refuses to get out of her car. \n\nHis family is also upset that I apparently don\u2019t let them hold our baby. I have never rejected someone in his family when they asked to hold the baby, I always happily hand her off when someone asks. After all, I want her to bond with her family. My husband said tonight that I should offering. It never even crossed my mind that I should be offering. I love holding our baby. Offering isn\u2019t really a huge thing in my family. \n\nTo add to the fire, I brought along my mother to my husband\u2019s sister\u2019s quincea\u00f1era about a month ago and we all had fun, but they noticed that my mother was holding the baby a lot. My mom is constantly asking to hold her anytime she sees our baby, and like I said, I don\u2019t say no when people ask. His family took this personally and didn\u2019t even try to really interact with our baby after that.\n\nMy husband and I ran into his mom today and he asked her if she wanted to hold the baby. She rejected the offer and she voiced that she feels unwelcome in our home and was upset about my mother holding the baby at the quincea\u00f1era when she didn\u2019t get to hold her at all, but she didn\u2019t even try to. My husband took her side, which really hurt. \n\nAll of these concerns were voiced to me all at once tonight. So, I didn\u2019t have context while they were happening. I don\u2019t want to have problems with him or his family. They have actually done a lot for me. Maybe I\u2019m giving off a weird vibe somehow to them - I know I can be super socially awkward, but I feel like my actions with my family vs his have been virtually the same.

You\u2019ve run bang smack into \u201cAsk\u201d versus \u201cGuess\u201d culture:\n\n>\u201cThis is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture.\n\n>In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.\n\n>In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.\n\n>All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.\n\n>If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.\n\n>Obviously she's an Ask and you're a Guess. (I'm a Guess too. Let me tell you, it's great for, say, reading nuanced and subtle novels; not so great for, say, dating and getting raises.)\n\n>Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior. Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at (pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone.\u201d \n\nFrom [here](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421) and a useful summary in the Guardian [here](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser)\n\nBasically you are supposed to \u201cguess\u201d what your husband\u2019s family wants, so that you can then delicately offer them what they wanted. You are used to being asked in a straightforward way, and are feeling resentful at these shenanigans. \n\nYour husband\u2019s family think you are a heartless unfeeling wench for not having guessed that they want to be offered the baby to hold, and are now actively whinging about it. Things must be bad for them to have actually had to directly state what they want, directly to your face. \n\nUnder any other circumstances, I think you\u2019d find this funny, but you\u2019ve just had a baby and understandably have very little extra energy for the level of telepathy your husband\u2019s family requires. \n\nAs *he* comes from this culture, why not get *him* to run the telepathic interference ? He can guess away at what his family is hinting at, and proffer the baby at suitable intervals to appease his mother. You could even have an extra nap while all this hinting and guessing is going on. \n\nAs you can probably tell, I\u2019m an asker and find the whole thing preposterous; but given that this really does sound like a cultural difference, it can be easily solved by letting him run interference with his family. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nPeople who don't communicate what they want and expect you to guess are a plague on society.

The first person you need to set straight is your husband. YOU ARE NOT A MIND READER. It is not on you to anticipate everyone else's unspoken wishes and desires. It's on THEM to communicate, and ask for things. They are responsible for their own mistaken assumptions, and their own choices and actions! I'm guessing that their broken-communication pattern has been going on for so long, that your husband sees it as 'normal', accepts that it is permissible, and that's why he sides with them. It may take a lot of 'reality checks' to fix this, maybe even a marital counselor so he can hear it from a Third party!  Then he needs to set his Mother and the rest of the family straight. This one bad dynamic is going to create a lifetime of problems for you and your relationships.", "INFO: What other \u201cunpopular boundaries\u201d have you set?

You don't owe anyone YOUR baby.", "I think what has happened here is that your in-laws were uncomfortable with your rule that they needed to call first before visiting. Your rule was entirely reasonable but for whatever reason they felt unwelcome. Probably your husband should have coupled this rule with invitations of his own for his family to come visit the baby at times he was home. But he didn't do that. As a result, your in-laws showed up with little notice a few times and were unable to see the baby because you were asleep. Hence they became uncomfortable around you, I think that's why they don't feel comfortable asking you if they can hold the baby. \n\nI agree with others that what you have is a husband problem. It was good that your husband agreed with your rule of asking people to call first before visiting, but it sounds like he didn't combine that with proactive attempts to include his family, by setting up visits for times he'd be home, or by giving them the baby to hold. \n\nThe quinceanera. Why was your mom there? Was she invited? It doesn't sound like your mother is good friends with your in-laws. Aren't quincaneras usually quite fancy? Is it normal for a sister-in-law's mother to attend? I am wondering if you might have made a bit of a faux-pas there. \n\nYour baby is 9 months old now, old enough to have her own relationship with her grandparents. You don't have to hold her all the time and there is still time to develop a nice relationship between her and your in-laws if your in-laws are decent people who would be trustworthy grandparents. But it will probably require some help from you as your daughter will look to you to see if these people can be trusted.", "Why not invite the in-laws over when your husband is home? Plan lunch and when MIL comes over, you hand off the baby (I am so busy, would you be so kind as to hold baby Bee while I get things done? Yes? My hero!). Make it a regular thing - second Saturday of the month, or however your schedule and their's works.", "NAH except maybe for your husband for not having  your back.\n\nYou say you don't understand why they feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, but you've explained exactly why they feel that way. That sort of means you do understand, you just think they shouldn't feel that way. Go out and invite your MIL in when she comes to the house. Don't take no for an answer. Tell her that you feel horrible (you obviously do) that she feels the way she does, and you want to do everything in your power to make her feel more welcome and comfortable. Offer the baby to them to hold. You don't get it, and that's fine, but they likely think it's rude to ask. It costs you nothing to offer and will solve that problem. In the end, there are some very simple things you can do to alleviate a lot of the tension.", "These expectations are ridiculous. They sound like immature communicators. Your husband needs to take the rein on this, you\u2019re the team here; it\u2019s not his family vs you. Sadly a lot of men have trouble grasping this, especially when mommy is angry/sad/disappointed/whatever.", "Everyone needs to calm down here, posters too. What good comes from letting these bad feelings fester? Come on. It is time to reset this. I easily took my baby granddaughter from my daughter. If the baby needed a new diaper or bottle, I just did it. She spit up on her outfit? I put a new one on the baby.  I was way more cautious with my DIL. Always asked if it was OK to take the baby.  Would you like me to change her diaper? Can I heat up a bottle? Always asked, before acting.  I was fearful of overstepping. I didn't want to look pushy or overbearing. \n\nThis is a small thing to say... \"Would you like to hold her?\" MIL may not feel comfortable asking after the drop by and see you fiascos. And yes, they **should** have called like you asked. You and his family have definitely gone off the tracks. Calm all of this down. It's gotten awkward, so help fix it. Just help. Don't take the full responsibility. This is new to all of you. Husband too. Find out how all of you can restart. \n\nMaybe you don't want some a sit down talk and action plan. I'm that way. If  I were you, the next time MIL is pouting in the car, I take that baby too her. I'd say, \"Baby, look it's grandma (or whatever name you use for her). It's so nice to see her. Hi grandma!\" I would do it every week. I wouldn't care if MIL kept the window rolled up and door closed. When it's too cold or rainy, text g'ma. Tell her you won't be able to bring the baby outside today and you hope she has time to come in. You can only control your actions. A small kindness may be met with a positive response.

We have a lot miscommunication, it\u2019s to a point now, were we as a family just don\u2019t really bother with my brother and new family. This has caused a lot resentment and hurt feelings.\n\nMy suggestion to you is communicate.

You can\u2019t make people feel bad for wanting to see their grandchild\u2026 rejecting them a few times \u2026. Them expect them to still die to see your kid.  Entitled new mothers are so unbearable\u2026 be happy that someone wants to love your child\u2026 it\u2019s not the Baby Jesus - relax", "And the fact that you didn\u2019t think to honor your mother in law by giving her a corsage or something and then putting the baby in her arms at the quinceneara so she could be the loving grandma makes you stupid and classless.", "They invited her because my daughter will eventually have a quincea\u00f1era and we all thought it was a good idea for her to be exposed to one. Plus, his family hadn\u2019t had a chance to meet my mom until that point.", "Yes. They were happy to invite her because they hadn\u2019t yet met her (long story) and because we wanted to expose her to the culture.", "It\u2019s implied she invited them, as she said they set a boundary of \u201cjust call before\u201d. And she does call, 5 mins before. In the guess mindset, OP said she was willing to have them over, so everything should be good. Then OP is sleeping, and so clearly the visitor misread the cue. After a couple mistimings, MIL wants to stay in the car to avoid intruding. Maybe she interprets the sleeping as the new mom signaling she isn\u2019t available for MIL visits at all. Add in a bit of self-centered thinking and stubbornness, and you get a MIL with no relationship with her grandkid, while firmly believing it\u2019s not her fault.", "I'd be willing to bet he does 0 child care either,  that's why op always has the baby, and the awkwardness that already occurred won't let Mil ask op.", "Yeah we have no kids but if you show up unannounced, you're getting treated like a solicitor.", "Exactly! I sometimes nap in the afternoon. No way am I getting up to answer the door (assuming I even hear it). \n\nBut I also know folks like the in-laws who are more comfortable with accepting an offer than asking. That's okay. HOWEVER, then the husband needs to be doing it, not dump it all on OP.", "I don\u2019t have kids and I hate it when someone asks me if I want to hold her baby.  I hate holding babies.", " I don\u2019t really feel like that means I need to do it too after reading the comments.\n\nYou really need to decide what is better for your family. In this case, mend the fence and ask if they want to hold your baby. It is a small price for a happy family. A lot of these comments are borderline hostile and if you listen, you will be divorced before you know it. Marriage is a team effort full of compromise. Your MIL helps you a lot. She just doesn't feel like you want her in your babie's life. My DIL didn't want anyone to hold her baby either. So I would ask. That's just me though. She couldn't have made her without my son so I felt I had the right. She was fine with it. Don't get your back up and cut your nose off despite your face. You will regret it.", "ESH\n\nYou willingly hand her off constantly to your mother. \n\nIt takes little effort to ask if they want to hold the baby. And the unspoken thing is that it looks like they aren\u2019t harassing you to hold the baby and hoping you could initiate. If you are the one primarily holding her then it\u2019s upon you to offer her. That\u2019s if you want them to have the same experience your mom gets. \n\nAlso, do you ever initiate inviting his family at times that are good for you besides \u2018just knock?\u2019 Can you invite for a dinner or just for them to come hang out at a good time? Is it that hard?\n\nWhat effort do you AND your husband put forth?\n\nI can see why they feel uncomfortable. \n\nYou don\u2019t HAVE to initiate anything but if you actually WANT a good relationship, where do you initiate your part of the relationship?", "Are they a different culture than you?", "Tell him that he doesn\u2019t need to ask your family \u2014 you should each be responsible for dealing with your own family. He\u2019s not doing a good job dealing with his right now which is his problem, not yours. If he wants to build a better relationship with them, he needs to work on that, not you. But so far they seem overbearing and unreasonable so he has some fixing to do", "Well, he did that to his mom this time, and she said no,  sounds like his whole family, him included, just plain suck. If you can't win either way, don't play their games.", "I've always asked if I can hold the baby. Sometimes the mom asks, but I think it's on the person who wants to hold the baby. Of course a new mom wants to hold her baby the most!", "My niece asked me if I wanted to hold her baby and I did not want to but what choice do you have but to say yes? It made me horribly uncomfortable! I've never held that kid since. I found it weird like she was pushing the kid on me. I asked if she wanted to eat since it was a party, but no ... She just wanted me to hold the kid. I found it weird.", "I think it's a pretty minimal effort to let someone know you're cool with them holding the baby when you know the relationship is on delicate ground, especially if your husband has suggested it.\n\nBut, I don't know why your husband couldn't step in and suggest it himself. Hey mum, do you want to have a hold?\n\nBut your MIL is definitely being dramatic.", "So don't. And truthfully, if I wanted to hold a baby, I would ask (hello common sense). And it wouldn't be for long. Just a few minutes. Your husband should be your number one supporter. He is letting you down. You two need a serious conversation. He is being an AH.", "Hate when people ask me to hold their baby personally! I feel bad if I say no and sometimes I don't want to hold the baby if we are out and about. The quinceanera, I would have assumed they were busy enjoying the party so if they aren't asking they don't have time. \n\nNTA", "Oh yeah, you would know, because calling someone \u201cstupid and classless\u201d is *reeeaaal* classy lol\n\n/s\n\nEdit: wording.", "Maybe if he\u2019s that worried about it then he should be holding the bay himself at his family\u2019s events.", "Love this. Ask them every few minutes. Ask when their hands are full. Ask when they are already holding the baby. Don't want any misunderstandings, since they need an engraved invitation and clearly can't communicate without prompting...", "I was thinking that initially, but I cannot imagine anyone from a guess culture showing up at someone's house without a specific invitation for that day and time. I was raised in a guess culture, and it's part of what I appreciate about it- surprise visits are rude.", "Last time someone asked me if I wanted to hold their baby, I immediately dropped my phone on the ground and they said \"nevermind.\"", "She was asleep though?", "How in the world is she supposed to do that if she's SLEEPING?", "Yep. As someone who grew up in that sort of environment it's tough as hell to see the behavior as anything but the status quo.", "\u201cOh no thank you\u201d and just stare lol. \n\nBut for real, just a no thank you should be the first response. When they get weird after I suggest having like three different absurd but funny answers as to why. I personally love kids and will hold any baby, any time. BUT when it comes to refusing to do something that socially people think is a treat, I find having ridiculous answers as a back up to why either:\n\n1) breaks the tension with laughter \n\n2) confuses them long enough for you to escape \n\n3) points out (to the socially somewhat aware) that this ain\u2019t your bag and it ain\u2019t personal.\n\nDoesn\u2019t always work but using humor to deflect is the safest go to I\u2019ve found and it stretches my creative muscles", "\u201cEw, no.\u201d", "It\u2019s definitely cultural\u2014 I\u2019m in the US and have customers just hand Ms their kids to hold while they\u2019re doing XYZ. \n\nAnd that\u2019s at multiple jobs lol. Right now I work at an animal shelter and had a toddler fall asleep on my hip while her mom and sibling picked out a cat and I had to field another customer\u2019s questions that way.", "Maybe, or maybe a need for better communication (from OP\u2019s husband) seems to me like if he\u2019d communicated to his family better there\u2019d be less issues but he just expects OP to do things his family\u2019s way", "I'm in the US as well and NEVER get handed babies \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I'd love to hold almost every baby I see, but I would never ask.", "Yeah, I do think the husband could help with smoothing things over between them. He knows both his family and op and could maybe find a way to help each side see the other's needs. Or just handle his side of the family.", "Reeeaaallly, where?"]}
