Beggars can't be choosers - you are paying for the seats and it's what she would have bought for herself.  \n\nAlso are you really 14?  Because at 14 I'm surprised YOU can pay for any seats yourself, let alone business class seats like your friends are suggesting.  Do they have any idea what that costs?!?", "NTA. She invited herself along, and apparently close to the trip, and you already had tickets, and buying tickets closer to the time of a trip is always more expensive. It's not like you bought all three tickets and the same time and put her in economy. How is this not understandable? You're fine OP. NTA.", "NTA - what is a 14year old doing buying plane tickets in the first place?  Let your \"friends\" know that A) it isn't your money that is being spent.  And B) this is how air travel works.  If you were to buy a last minute business class ticket it would be almost 10X the amount that you and your mom paid.", "NTA. She asked to go and is an adult.", "NTA. She basically invited herself, last minute. You get what you get and you don't throw a fit.\n\nHave fun! :)", "You shouldn't have to pay for her ticket at all. She should pay for it herself", "You're 14, how is this your problem?", "NTA per Reddit usual you have contrarian friends who need to see things from the other side. The same friends who think you should've paid wouldn't do the same themselves.", "NTA. She can play for an upgrade", "She invited herself onto your trip and your supposed to pay for business class? NTA. Was there something about this trip that suggests you should have thought to invite her in the first place? Also, your friends say you should have, what does your aunt say?", "She got there didn\u2019t she?", "Give Tia your seat ! \ud83d\udc95", "After 30 years away and possibly a lot of memories and emotions running through her mind, wouldn't it be a lovely gesture to upgrade her seat as a surprise? Instead, she travels in the crappiest seat possible while you two enjoy business class. Are your finances also as tight as hers or don't you like her very much?\n\nYTA", "You're 14 be a good fella and swap seats with your aunt. Really not that much difference on a short flight, and what a gesture to start a trip! It's mainly the free grog and service that makes business worth it, the extra room on a short flight really isn't worth the upgrade.", "INFO: What is the income level of you guys and your aunt?

It\u2019s her budget, not yours.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy doesn't your aunt buy her oown tichets, what has this got to do with you?", "NTA\n\nYou're 14.  Presumably, this went on your mother's credit card or your aunt's card, you're too young to pay directly.\n\nDid you talk to your mother about prices and options?  Did you talk to your aunt about her budget?\n\nHow much you spend was dependent on what your aunt could afford, and if your mother was willing to contribute, and if so, how much.\n\nUnless you, personally, had enough saved to make up the difference is cost, without dipping into things like your college fund, upgrading the seat was not in your power.  Helping your aunt and mother find a seat within their available budget is not the same as you buying a ticket and choosing how much of your money you'll spend.", "NTA.\n\nWhen you join a vacation at the last minute, beggars can't be choosers. \n\nWas the aunt even upset about this?", "NTA. Unless you could get the same deal on tickets and she would pay for it, I don't see how it's your responsibility to put someone who invited themselves on your trip in Business. She can pay for business if she wants it.", "NTA she invited herself, she travels on her budget, you go on yours.", "She should be grateful she's getting a free ticket, full stop.

There may not even have been any business class or more comfortable economy class tickets available at the last minute.", "We are upper middle class while my aunt is lower class & no my aunt isn\u2019t aware me and my mom tried telling her but she might get upset..", "I assumed he fat fingered it and is 24.", "Upper middle class doesn't specify much. Here are my two cents. If you guys are close, and covering the difference between economy and bussiness is not a big deal, it would be a sweet and nice geasture on your end. \n\nIf you guys can't afford paying, at least tell her before hand so that she doesn't get shocked at the airport and feel like shit throughout the ride.", "Does upper middle class now have the ability to remove other passengers from their seats to buy late tickets for others?", "OP says\n\n>since she\u2019s on a really tight budget the cheapest seats were in the middle seats on the back\n\ni.e. the aunt is in that seat because of price, not because it's the only one left.\n\nI'd agree that covering the difference is a nice gesture, but it's kind of weird for the aunt to invite herself.", "Maybe she feels uncomfortable traveling alone and suddenly realised she wouldn't have to. Maybe she felt nervous about going back after 30 years and needs some moral support."]}
