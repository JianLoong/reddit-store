We started getting small stuff like toys and a leash and such and I started preparations in the yard for putting up a bigger fence.\nAnd then the food came up. My fiancee is vegan, I am not (I'm vegetarian), this has never been an issue honestly, she knows my diet is already pretty limited due to some medical issues I've had since childhood (bunch of allergies and what not) and I don't really wanna limit it further.\nBut when we were talking about food for the dog the other day she said, pretty confidently, that she's intending to feed it a vegan diet. When I asked her to elaborate she just said that studies say they can be good on a vegan diet and they don't HAVE to eat meat. \nI disagreed immediately and said I'd feed the dog whatever the vet recommends I feed it and that's most likely not gonna be a vegan diet, they're possible but super hard to maintain from what I've read. Nutrients and stuff.\nShe got pretty mad and said if there's an alternative she's always gonna go with the alternative and that vets really just don't believe in the vegan lifestyle (wonder what the reason for that could be.)\nI said if she's not gonna listen to what the vet recommends, we're not getting a dog.\nShe started crying and saying that it isn't fair of me and she hasn't really talked to me much since.\nSo am I the asshole for backpaddling on the dog even tho we were well into the preparations?\n\nTl,dr: my fiancee wants to feed our future dog a vegan diet and I said not unless the vet specifically recommends it; when she persisted I said we're not getting a dog then.", "created_utc": 1667994394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqgmsq/aita_for_backpaddling_on_getting_a_dog/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was thin and its fur was in poor health. He found out his roommate only fed it vegetables because he was trying to be vegan. Said husband would sneak it hamburgers (he ate at fast food restaurants a lot). The dog LOVED him. Its fur grew in full and shiny.

Feeding a dog a vegetarian let alone vegan diet will shorten its life.\n\nBetter to be responsible beforehand and not get one.", "First of all that isn\u2019t backpedaling. Second NTA. The reality is if you can\u2019t come to an agreement on how to raise the dog (specially with something as important as food) then you guys aren\u2019t ready to get a dog. Full stop the reality is you guys need to discuss things a lot more. You need to speak to a local vet. Is there a vegan/vegetarian dog food they can recommend? So I had a baby (she\u2019s almost 6 now) who couldn\u2019t drink any kind of formula and I couldn\u2019t produce milk. I have medical issues. Our state doesn\u2019t have a milk bank so our option was Facebook stranger giving us milk (not going to happen) or formula. She was allergic to every formula. She was so sick. Finally someone suggested making fresh goats milk formula every day. So we did with the stipulation that she would have regular labs drawn. A doctor we were friends with questioned me on why I would put my baby through regular blood draws and pain just to feed a goat milk formula I made. (I explained. She agreed.) Here is why I\u2019m telling you this. If the vegan diet comes with strings like lab work and other things to make sure he\u2019s healthy...is the vegan diet worth it? In our case the goats milk formula was worth it. She gained a pound in a week. She was going on 2-3 months and hadn\u2019t even put in half a pound. So yes. But is it worth making the dog suffer? You guys will have to decide. But it all needs to be worked out BEFORE getting the dog or committing to the dog. What other issues?", "NTA\n\nSo I have seen some articles in the past couple of years saying scientifically dogs can be healthy - even in some cases healthier than a off the shelf dog food from a grocery store - on a vegan diet but as you say it\u2019s harder to get the balance right \n\nCats cannot be vegan they are carnivores - but dogs are omnivores \n\nPersonally though I am still saying NTA because to me that means they should have a balanced diet involving meat and vegetables.\n\nThis is a major thing to consider though - how much research has she done into a balanced vegan dog diet and how much work is she willing to put in? And what if the vegan diet doesn\u2019t agree with your dog? Dogs, like people, sometimes have foods that don\u2019t agree with them - peanut butter can be safe for dogs but goes straight through mine so we eliminated it as a treat - is she going to put the health of your dog first or will it be more important to her that the dog\u2019s diet doesn\u2019t involve other animals? \n\nIt\u2019s cruel to not ensure a pet is given a healthy balanced and nutritious diet - and that can vary per pet. If willing to do a lot of research and put in the time and money to get a suitable vegan diet it might be possible but is she prepared for that?", "NTA!  I have a friend doing the raw diet and her dog has gotten food poisoning from it twice and looks like a skeleton now because of the lack of nourishment. Listen to your vet, it\u2019s not fair to try fads on dogs!", "This would be like telling a wolf not to eat meat. Dogs are carnivores. Because guess what will happen when it goes after that squirrel, rabbit etc. And they will gonafter thrm. It is instinctual. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Years ago I had a dog and got more expensive special food at the vet or pet store. He had skin problems and the vet gave us some spray to use on these horrible red areas of his skin. Well then I had a baby and just didn\u2019t have time off that \u201cbetter\u201d food. So I just gave him Dog Chow. Magically his skin problems went away. \n\nIt was my mom that was TA for backpedaling. She told my daughter that she should ask for a puppy for Christmas. Of course that irritated me because I didn\u2019t have time and I couldn\u2019t afford it. So when I talked to her about it she said, oh well I just expected you to say no. Ok\u2026 So my daughter made a ten page power point presentation about why she needs a puppy. But I still couldn\u2019t afford the kind of small dog she wanted. So before Christmas a coworker asked me what my daughter wanted for Christmas and I told her that story. She told me that she got a little white pure bred dog and decided she didn\u2019t really want a dog she wanted to travel and she offered to just give us the dog with the cage and all the other things she got. So I felt like I would be a terrible mom if I said no, so of course I got her the puppy. My mom was furious. She said she just couldn\u2019t believe I would get her a dog and she assumed I would say no. She was just awful about it.
