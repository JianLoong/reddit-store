My fiancee is vegan, I am not (I'm vegetarian), this has never been an issue honestly, she knows my diet is already pretty limited due to some medical issues I've had since childhood (bunch of allergies and what not) and I don't really wanna limit it further.\nBut when we were talking about food for the dog the other day she said, pretty confidently, that she's intending to feed it a vegan diet. When I asked her to elaborate she just said that studies say they can be good on a vegan diet and they don't HAVE to eat meat. \nI disagreed immediately and said I'd feed the dog whatever the vet recommends I feed it and that's most likely not gonna be a vegan diet, they're possible but super hard to maintain from what I've read.

The reality is if you can\u2019t come to an agreement on how to raise the dog (specially with something as important as food) then you guys aren\u2019t ready to get a dog. Full stop the reality is you guys need to discuss things a lot more. You need to speak to a local vet. Is there a vegan/vegetarian dog food they can recommend? So I had a baby (she\u2019s almost 6 now) who couldn\u2019t drink any kind of formula and I couldn\u2019t produce milk. I have medical issues. Our state doesn\u2019t have a milk bank so our option was Facebook stranger giving us milk (not going to happen) or formula. She was allergic to every formula. She was so sick. Finally someone suggested making fresh goats milk formula every day. So we did with the stipulation that she would have regular labs drawn. A doctor we were friends with questioned me on why I would put my baby through regular blood draws and pain just to feed a goat milk formula I made. (I explained. She agreed.) Here is why I\u2019m telling you this. If the vegan diet comes with strings like lab work and other things to make sure he\u2019s healthy...is the vegan diet worth it? In our case the goats milk formula was worth it. She gained a pound in a week. She was going on 2-3 months and hadn\u2019t even put in half a pound. So yes. But is it worth making the dog suffer? You guys will have to decide. But it all needs to be worked out BEFORE getting the dog or committing to the dog. What other issues?", "NTA\n\nSo I have seen some articles in the past couple of years saying scientifically dogs can be healthy - even in some cases healthier than a off the shelf dog food from a grocery store - on a vegan diet but as you say it\u2019s harder to get the balance right \n\nCats cannot be vegan they are carnivores - but dogs are omnivores \n\nPersonally though I am still saying NTA because to me that means they should have a balanced diet involving meat and vegetables.\n\nThis is a major thing to consider though - how much research has she done into a balanced vegan dog diet and how much work is she willing to put in? And what if the vegan diet doesn\u2019t agree with your dog? Dogs, like people, sometimes have foods that don\u2019t agree with them - peanut butter can be safe for dogs but goes straight through mine so we eliminated it as a treat - is she going to put the health of your dog first or will it be more important to her that the dog\u2019s diet doesn\u2019t involve other animals? \n\nIt\u2019s cruel to not ensure a pet is given a healthy balanced and nutritious diet - and that can vary per pet. If willing to do a lot of research and put in the time and money to get a suitable vegan diet it might be possible but is she prepared for that?", "NTA!  I have a friend doing the raw diet and her dog has gotten food poisoning from it twice and looks like a skeleton now because of the lack of nourishment. Listen to your vet, it\u2019s not fair to try fads on dogs!", "This would be like telling a wolf not to eat meat. Dogs are carnivores.

So before Christmas a coworker asked me what my daughter wanted for Christmas and I told her that story. She told me that she got a little white pure bred dog and decided she didn\u2019t really want a dog she wanted to travel and she offered to just give us the dog with the cage and all the other things she got.

I think the meat we are feeding our dogs is sourced in a sad way but that\u2019s a whole other problem and I won\u2019t hurt my dogs for a point", "May I recommend you guys get a bunny or hamster :) they would love that life !", "NTA - I have maintained a vegan diet for 7 years and adopted a puppy 3 months ago. I actually make her a kibble topper homemade with chicken and beef. Dogs need meat not a trendy diet. If she can\u2019t see that I wouldn\u2019t get any animal with her.", "Wow nta at all and good on you for advocating for that dog.  A vet will most assuredly tell you that the only time it is okay (and with tons of monitoring) to put your dog on a meat free diet (meat free not vegan) is if they have debilitating allergies to all meat.  You can severely limit a dog\u2019s life by feeding it a vegan diet and the only place she is finding research saying dogs do well on it is on vegan websites with no actual scientific backing.  I would love to be vegan but can\u2019t as well due to health issues and I would never try to force my way of life onto a creature that needs meat to live a full life", "As a veterinarian, my training involved quite a decent amount of nutritional coverage, spearheaded by an incredibly enthusiastic board certified veterinary nutritionist. We are also trained to spot the bullshit in published studies when the study author just happens to be the chief veterinary officer for a food company etc. I recommend prescription diets for specific conditions purely on the basis that actual non-bogus scientific trials have shown they will effect the change I am trying to achieve in managing the patient's health. Last time a rep came to visit my clinic we got a tray of muffins from the supermarket, not even a single cruise ticket, flash car or overseas holiday. The idea that vets get little to no nutritional training and are shills for food companies is a tired old trope.", "My late dog's favorite food was French fries. Definitely not good for him but they were his very favorite.", "My dude, the Gainful Gardener is pointing out the difference between _surviving_ and _thriving._ While dogs can _survive_ without meat, they will not _thrive._ It\u2019s like arguing if dogs really need all that exercise. They won\u2019t die from lack of exercise, but they thrive if they\u2019re exercised regularly.", "Can you name one place on earth where a dog would live where there wouldn\u2019t have been other wild animals to eat?", "When I was with my mom and dog gathering berries I tried to give some to him, but he just dropped them.\n\nLater when we were at home, mom gave some to their dog who absolutely loves berries. My dog went over because there was obviously something good being given.\n\nAnd now he magically liked them. I bet he didn't even taste them before, just immidiately discarded them \ud83d\ude02 but seeing the other dog love them made him try them too. I just said that he could have gotten a lot more if he ate them in the forest, now he had to share the scraps with the other dog \ud83d\ude05", "yes! all of this.  That doesn't mean that your cat may or may not enjoy a 'treat' on the side.  One of my cats really enjoys a bit of butternut squash.  It is not part of his diet. It is an extra.  A healthy one for him because he has kitty inflammatory bowel syndrome and the fiber in his strange treat choice actually helps him.  This is vet approved by his vet for his needs and not something people should randomly try.  It's also the cat's personal preference (because he is a weird one) not something we force on him.  \n\n\nAlso OP NTA.  There are other animals that can bring joy to your family and exist with your fiancee's diet restrictions.  I had a pet rabbit (large breed) that happily went out on a leash.  She lived ten years and was a wonderful companion.  Rabbits can also be litter trained with a bit of patience and clock watching.", "Reddit is such a strange place.  I worked as an RVT for 20 years and the second half of that was in canine rehab and nutrition.  But, hey, they'll just down vote and call you a liar if you don't jump on the Y T A bandwagon.  Cognitive dissonance abounds.  Let the down voting begin.", "Not exactly, it's more complicated than that. Like many diseases, having the genes doesn't necessarily mean the disease will develop, it needs a trigger. Such as a taurine deficiency."]}
