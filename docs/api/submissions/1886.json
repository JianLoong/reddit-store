When I asked her to elaborate she just said that studies say they can be good on a vegan diet and they don't HAVE to eat meat. \nI disagreed immediately and said I'd feed the dog whatever the vet recommends I feed it and that's most likely not gonna be a vegan diet, they're possible but super hard to maintain from what I've read.

Full stop the reality is you guys need to discuss things a lot more. You need to speak to a local vet. Is there a vegan/vegetarian dog food they can recommend? So I had a baby (she\u2019s almost 6 now) who couldn\u2019t drink any kind of formula and I couldn\u2019t produce milk. I have medical issues. Our state doesn\u2019t have a milk bank so our option was Facebook stranger giving us milk (not going to happen) or formula. She was allergic to every formula. She was so sick. Finally someone suggested making fresh goats milk formula every day. So we did with the stipulation that she would have regular labs drawn. A doctor we were friends with questioned me on why I would put my baby through regular blood draws and pain just to feed a goat milk formula I made. (I explained. She agreed.) Here is why I\u2019m telling you this. If the vegan diet comes with strings like lab work and other things to make sure he\u2019s healthy...is the vegan diet worth it? In our case the goats milk formula was worth it. She gained a pound in a week. She was going on 2-3 months and hadn\u2019t even put in half a pound. So yes. But is it worth making the dog suffer? You guys will have to decide. But it all needs to be worked out BEFORE getting the dog or committing to the dog. What other issues?", "NTA\n\nSo I have seen some articles in the past couple of years saying scientifically dogs can be healthy - even in some cases healthier than a off the shelf dog food from a grocery store - on a vegan diet but as you say it\u2019s harder to get the balance right \n\nCats cannot be vegan they are carnivores - but dogs are omnivores \n\nPersonally though I am still saying NTA because to me that means they should have a balanced diet involving meat and vegetables.\n\nThis is a major thing to consider though - how much research has she done into a balanced vegan dog diet and how much work is she willing to put in? And what if the vegan diet doesn\u2019t agree with your dog? Dogs, like people, sometimes have foods that don\u2019t agree with them - peanut butter can be safe for dogs but goes straight through mine so we eliminated it as a treat - is she going to put the health of your dog first or will it be more important to her that the dog\u2019s diet doesn\u2019t involve other animals? \n\nIt\u2019s cruel to not ensure a pet is given a healthy balanced and nutritious diet - and that can vary per pet. If willing to do a lot of research and put in the time and money to get a suitable vegan diet it might be possible but is she prepared for that?", "NTA!  I have a friend doing the raw diet and her dog has gotten food poisoning from it twice and looks like a skeleton now because of the lack of nourishment. Listen to your vet, it\u2019s not fair to try fads on dogs!", "This would be like telling a wolf not to eat meat. Dogs are carnivores.

So before Christmas a coworker asked me what my daughter wanted for Christmas and I told her that story. She told me that she got a little white pure bred dog and decided she didn\u2019t really want a dog she wanted to travel and she offered to just give us the dog with the cage and all the other things she got.

Dogs cannot survive on a vegan diet! That's a fact. They require protein. You can't substitute vegan protein for dogs as it's high in starches which is very bad for dogs. There will be a host of health issues you'll be dealing with if you try this. Don't get me wrong, certain fruits and vegetables are relatively good for dogs, but can't nutrionally sustain them. Look at Dogs Naturally on facebook. They have a ton of videos and info on proper balanced nutrition for your dog's.", "NTA. Veganism is a choice that humans make based on their ethical views. Dogs are not human and thus it is absolutely not fair to enforce your personal, human ethical code on the poor dog. The dog is not going to be vegan, but it may easily end up malnourished from eating an inadequate diet. Besides, does your fiancee really think the dog will be vegan? The dog will accept, scavenge, hunt, catch and eat whatever animal products it can find when it has an opportunity to do so. If your fiancee wants a vegan pet, then she should get an animal that is evolved to eat a herbivorous diet. Bunnies can make good pets.", "NTA but if she is so animal rights how does she even think it is ok imprisoning and owning an animal?", "NTA and if you plan to have children you probably at some point need to discuss their future diet.

This issue could be exposing an underlying values/personality conflict that in the future could be relationship ending.", "NTA. you're preventing animal abuse basically. if veganism is her hill to die on she should get a bird or something", "NTA \n\n* Dogs lack the enzyme amylase in their saliva. Amylase is the enzyme that\u2019s responsible for breaking down carbohydrates.\n* Dogs\u2019 digestive tracts are much shorter than ours. So foods have less time to be digested and processed.\n* Dogs don\u2019t need carbohydrates in their diet to sustain life. They have different metabolism routes to fuel their cells.\n* Dogs need taurine and L-carnitine in their diet. Taurine and L-carnitine are amino acids found only in meat. They are responsible for eye and heart health, reproduction and fat metabolism.\n* Dogs need to eat large amounts of plant-based food to cover their caloric needs\n\nNTA - dogs are obligatory omnivores just as cats are obligatory carnivores.\n\nThey REQUIRE meat proteins.\n\nThey can eat a balanced diet with more vegetable matter than cats can, but they need meat.", "NTA I am literally sitting in one of my college classes to be a Veterinary Technician right now, you're doing the right thing. Veganism isn't long term sustainable because the dog could have all the supplements in the world but that would be horrible for your dog's system long term. You can have every supplement necessary but if you only eat corn meal to fill your caloric need (that's all I'd assume vegan dog food is) then it's still not healthy. Humans can choose veganism if they want, but it's not a choice for other omnivores and it's not a choice she should be making for them going against a  v e t e r i n a r i a n.

Veganism has killed many dogs and cats. If she isn't gonna be the one to pay for the food and feed the dog then she gets no say in the matter. Also, it's just a bad idea.", "NAH dating a vegan can be hard (i am a vegan and will only date vegans due to world view differences) this is a perfect example as to why it\u2019s hard\u2026feeding a dog a vegan diet is backed with science (funded by vegans) and so is feeding a dog a non vegan diet (funded by non vegans in pet food) it\u2019s a hard choice. do as you like but if you\u2019re buying the food you can decide what to feed it.", "NTA.

Your fianc\u00e9 is a monster", "NTA from a vegetarian vet tech\u2019s perspective.

Tell your gf to get a rabbit!", "NTA, dogs \\*can\\* eat vegan, but it won't be happy, and it's just selfish to inflict these choices on a dog. If she isn't willing to feed a dog a diet that keeps it happy and healthy, just don't get a dog.", "NTA - you are adult humans that can make that choice for yourselves, but the dog is a completely different species that does not share the same dietary needs as we humans have. Going with the Vet recommendation is the most responsible thing to do.  Your fianc\u00e9 needs to chill the fuck out with her vegan religion.", "Oh god....no.....no no no!\n\nNTA! NTA! NTA!!!\n\nYour GF does realize putting carnivorous/omnivorous pets on a vegan diet is ABUSE? Good on you for putting your foot down with her and refusing to get a dog if she will not abide by its necessary dietary habits. In all honesty, if she cannot separate her moral choices from a pets needs, then she should NOT have any animal as a pet unless they match her dietary choices; like guinea pigs, budgies, or rabbits. Even then, I say no. \n\nPeople who implement their lifestyles and morals on animals should not own any at all.", "NTA\n\nYour GF doesn't want to get a dog.

So you\u2019re ok harming the animal that you keep captive in your home by feeding it a diet it has not evolved for? As long as you don\u2019t harm all the other animals on the planet it\u2019s ok to harm your family member by forcing it to eat the same diet that you eat?", "I know right. Seems like she saw a buzzfeed article on \"Why Veganism is good for pets\" and rolled with it. It's okay to choose the lifestyle you want but if you're gonna put anyone else at risk by forcing them to incorporate it too, you're the A-hole.", "I am vegetarian because it\u2019s a personal choice that I have made. My husband is not vegetarian because it\u2019s his choice & not something he is interested in doing.

You have to do what's right for animals you choose to bring into your care. My partner and I are technically pescatarian (we eat fish/shellfish once every few months), but he leans vegan and I lean vegetarian. We have a cat.

You want a vegan pet, get a vegan pet. There's lots of them out there. If they had the space and money, I'd even suggest a fish tank, because fish can be super playful and sweet. \n\nTortoises are awesome though!

They give me so much joy and love that I\u2019m happy watching them gobble it up.", "Oh I didn\u2019t know that! I\u2019ll have to look into that. Regardless, dogs are capable of digesting grains and can eat a vegetarian diet if their nutritional needs are being met (which is difficult to do). Cats, however, cannot digest plant matter at all and will become malnourished on a vegetarian diet no matter what", "Not really, according to research by the Tufts Vet School.
