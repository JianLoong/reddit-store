They go to a home daycare during the day while we work. They're teacher, who we'll call Iggy, has been watching them since they were infants and had watched my son for years when he was younger. I am extremely chill with her and have never had any major problems.\n\nMy kids are all mixed race and have naturally thick and curly hair. I usually send them to daycare with it down since when you have 4 kids, that's about all you have time to do. I take good care of their hair and do everything I can to keep it healthy.\n\nThese past few weeks when I've gone to pick them up from daycare, my girls have come back with slick back ponytails that they excitedly tell me Iggy has done for them. They're usually heavily brushed back and gelled down so they stay in place. \n\nThis is annoying for me as virtually everytime she does their hair, I have to wash it since it is now a frizzy, crusted mess once taken out of the ponytail. I didn't mind it the first 2 or 3 times but now it's becoming a daily thing and it's getting to be really irritating. I barely have time to cook and clean and get my own stuff done let alone wash 3 girls' hair because their teacher keeps putting stuff in their hair.\n\nI expressed this to my husband after putting the kids to bed but he didn't see the problem. He just told me that Iggy was trying to let our girls have some fun and that it wasn't that serious. I explained that she could simply just tie their hair back, she didn't need to completely restyle it and use products to keep their hair set, they're 2 and 3 its not like it's gonna matter to them. He still didn't get it and told me to just relax. However he's not the one who has to wash hairspray and gel out of the kids' hair every other night.\n\nI would never say anything to Iggy directly because she really does mean well but it's exhausting having to do x10 extra work and I'm worried the constant brushing and tight ponytails could damage their hair. AITA for being so annoyed?\n\nEDIT: I know how to do their hair. I hate this stereotype that parents of mixed kids are completely clueless when it comes to hair. They have 3A - 3B curls, my hair is the same texture. The girls just see their friends with ponytails and ask izzy to do the same for their hair.", "created_utc": 1699297320, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pa6ut/aita_for_being_annoyed_my_daughters_teacher_did/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My daughter's daycare will do the same to her hair but it's usually because it helps keep it out of her eyes, she doesn't mind it, and they use no extra product. \n\nI'm actually surprised Iggy used product on your kids' heads. We have to fill out a form just giving our daycare permission to use baby sunscreen. Not that I think you should report Iggy, but something tells me that she could get herself or the daycare in a lot of trouble for using non-parent approved products on their kids (your kids could've had a bad reaction).\n\nIt is absolutely reasonable for you to ask Iggy not to style your kids' hair (besides a simple ponytail or something) because it means you have to wash their hair at night, but also you're wary of anyone using products on your kids that you haven't approved beforehand.", "NTA - and do please say something to the teacher. Base it on the extra work she is (unintentionally) creating for you. If she is not familiar with that hair type, she's likely just misguided and doing what she thinks is right. But it's the fact she is putting product in the hair of a child that does not belong to her every day that bothers me the most here.", "NTA. Tell your girls' daycare provider to lay off with the gel and tightly brushing their hair. To offset her urge to do their hair, you could braid/style their hair beforehand so there's no need for their hair to be done while they're in daycare. If you are in need of hair care tips for curly hair, pay a visit to a hairstylist who's expert in caring for African American/curly hair.", "NTA. It's worth having a gentle convo with the teacher about it and ask them to not use gel. If the teacher is reasonable they should be understanding. Possibly they don't realize that you wouldn't otherwise wash the kid's hair every day. Your husband can wash it out every day if he doesn't think it's a bi deal.", "NTA. But you really need to speak up and say something .\n\nThe reality is Iggy may be nice and well intentioned but as a Teacher she's overstepping Parental Boundaries and opening the School upto a lawsuit by doing this without your consent.", "NTA\n\nBut tell her you\u2019d rather their hair stay in its natural state. Gel and hairspray to the point of hardening the hair isn\u2019t healthy for anyone\u2019s hair and can lead to drying and hair pulling. If you don\u2019t mind the ponytails and just want to avoid the product, you can let her know that too.", "NTA. If she was literally just putting the hair in a ponytail, I could be on board. It\u2019s better for kids to have their hair up at younger ages. Helps keep it out of their face, reduces the spread of lice, will keep it tidier (ie no glue or paint gets in their hair), etc. however, what makes me stand with you is the gel. She has no clue what kind of allergies your kids may have, what if she had done this and your child had to go to the doctor for burns, rashes, or allergic reactions? I would have an honest conversation with this teacher about why this frustrates you and how you\u2019d appreciate if she refrained from using products in your children hair. However, your kids seem happy to get their hair done by this teacher. So maybe tell her \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with you putting their hair in ponytails or buns, but please refrain from using product on their hair for xyz reasons.\u201d If she continues the behavior you can always report her to the school board. But no need to escalate just yet, just have a firm but polite and honest conversation for now.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not even healthy to wash their hair everyday. Ask her to stop because having to wash out the products is drying out/damaging their hair.", "NTA.  I have curly hair so I know what you mean. Just simply tell her you don\u2019t mind their hair being put back in a pony but not to use products. That\u2019s it.  Your kids, your hair. Your not asking for a lot.
