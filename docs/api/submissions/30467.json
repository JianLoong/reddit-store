They go to a home daycare during the day while we work. They're teacher, who we'll call Iggy, has been watching them since they were infants and had watched my son for years when he was younger. I am extremely chill with her and have never had any major problems.\n\nMy kids are all mixed race and have naturally thick and curly hair. I usually send them to daycare with it down since when you have 4 kids, that's about all you have time to do. I take good care of their hair and do everything I can to keep it healthy.\n\nThese past few weeks when I've gone to pick them up from daycare, my girls have come back with slick back ponytails that they excitedly tell me Iggy has done for them. They're usually heavily brushed back and gelled down so they stay in place. \n\nThis is annoying for me as virtually everytime she does their hair, I have to wash it since it is now a frizzy, crusted mess once taken out of the ponytail. I didn't mind it the first 2 or 3 times but now it's becoming a daily thing and it's getting to be really irritating. I barely have time to cook and clean and get my own stuff done let alone wash 3 girls' hair because their teacher keeps putting stuff in their hair.\n\nI expressed this to my husband after putting the kids to bed but he didn't see the problem. He just told me that Iggy was trying to let our girls have some fun and that it wasn't that serious. I explained that she could simply just tie their hair back, she didn't need to completely restyle it and use products to keep their hair set, they're 2 and 3 its not like it's gonna matter to them. He still didn't get it and told me to just relax. However he's not the one who has to wash hairspray and gel out of the kids' hair every other night.\n\nI would never say anything to Iggy directly because she really does mean well but it's exhausting having to do x10 extra work and I'm worried the constant brushing and tight ponytails could damage their hair. AITA for being so annoyed?\n\nEDIT: I know how to do their hair. I hate this stereotype that parents of mixed kids are completely clueless when it comes to hair. They have 3A - 3B curls, my hair is the same texture. The girls just see their friends with ponytails and ask izzy to do the same for their hair.", "created_utc": 1699297320, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pa6ut/aita_for_being_annoyed_my_daughters_teacher_did/", "score": 305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your girls' daycare provider to lay off with the gel and tightly brushing their hair.

It's worth having a gentle convo with the teacher about it and ask them to not use gel. If the teacher is reasonable they should be understanding.

But you really need to speak up and say something .\n\nThe reality is Iggy may be nice and well intentioned but as a Teacher she's overstepping Parental Boundaries and opening the School upto a lawsuit by doing this without your consent.", "NTA\n\nBut tell her you\u2019d rather their hair stay in its natural state. Gel and hairspray to the point of hardening the hair isn\u2019t healthy for anyone\u2019s hair and can lead to drying and hair pulling. If you don\u2019t mind the ponytails and just want to avoid the product, you can let her know that too.", "NTA. If she was literally just putting the hair in a ponytail, I could be on board. It\u2019s better for kids to have their hair up at younger ages. Helps keep it out of their face, reduces the spread of lice, will keep it tidier (ie no glue or paint gets in their hair), etc. however, what makes me stand with you is the gel. She has no clue what kind of allergies your kids may have, what if she had done this and your child had to go to the doctor for burns, rashes, or allergic reactions? I would have an honest conversation with this teacher about why this frustrates you and how you\u2019d appreciate if she refrained from using products in your children hair. However, your kids seem happy to get their hair done by this teacher. So maybe tell her \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with you putting their hair in ponytails or buns, but please refrain from using product on their hair for xyz reasons.\u201d If she continues the behavior you can always report her to the school board. But no need to escalate just yet, just have a firm but polite and honest conversation for now.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not even healthy to wash their hair everyday. Ask her to stop because having to wash out the products is drying out/damaging their hair.", "NTA.  I have curly hair so I know what you mean. Just simply tell her you don\u2019t mind their hair being put back in a pony but not to use products. That\u2019s it.  Your kids, your hair. Your not asking for a lot.

I used to work in day care and many teachers and the students would like to play hairstylist and do eachothers hair. Mostly the kids like to play so the teachers do their hair and sometimes let the kids do theirs. I worked at 2 different schools and it was done at both places also knew other people that worked at other schools that did the same. In my college classes a professor even talked about it and said that even though it's common to do in daycare/preschools due to the kids wanting to play that it can be a sensitive subject especially when the child has textured hair. So i think it's possible that it is an innocent thing. Especially since OP said that they have known the teacher for years and have always been comfortable and gotten along with eachother. \n\nShe also mentioned that the girls come home happy and are excited to say that it was done by their teacher so that's why i am leaning more towards it being completely innocent. Most daycares/preschools like to keep the children happy and play what they like. Many people don't realize the difference of the work it takes to care for textured hair so the teacher may not realize that it is extra work for OP to do. She may have put the products in to help it to stay due to the flyaways and the heaviness of the hair making it fall out not realizing that it would be an issue to take it out. \n\nMy professor even said that many teachers don't realize how that seemingly innocent act can be controversial. She said that it can be difficult for the parents to remove like in OPs case and also how some parents take it as an insult and think the teachers are saying or thinking they don't know how to take care of their child's hair. She also addressed how the teachers don't mean it that way due to the children all just wanting to play and have fun. I can see where OPs girls may see the other children getting their hair done and they would want to be included not understanding the differences between the hair. And also the teachers either not realizing that it messes up the hair or not wanting the children to feel left out. \n\nI had the opposite issue, the daycare i worked at the teachers let the children brush or comb their hair and they wanted to do that with me but i have curly hair and brushes and combs can mess up my hair and make it a frizzy mess so i would have to find a compromise and ask them to braid it or put in it a ponytail without the brushing/combing. I would just nicely tell the children that my hair is different and tell them what they could do to it and they were completely understanding and did it the way i asked and still had fun. OP should nicely talk to the teacher and explain that it is difficult to deal with that way and maybe go over what can be done like maybe just ponytails or clips without the products and without the brushing so the children can still be included but their hair doesn't get messed up. I believe in this situation no one is in the wrong that it is just something that the teacher and children didn't see the harm in and OP is struggling with having to fix their hair and not understanding why it was done that way.", "I think you are.

So i don't think that is the case since she herself has that texture she would know how to take care of it also that curl type even though it can't be as easily handled is more low maintenance compared to other curl types where it can be left that way. I can see where she would find it faster than putting it up while getting them ready i have around the same curl type and i also pefer to leave it down not only is it faster i tend to get headaches when i style it up due to the weight of my hair and having to put it tight so it won't come undone.
