I texted my boyfriend that I just finished and was heading home, it\u2019s a good 45min drive due to traffic so it\u2019s usually not that pleasant of a drive after working a shift. I drive a stick shift so I\u2019m never on my phone while driving nor do I look at it while driving so if anyone tries to contact me during that time I won\u2019t see it or hear it due to keeping my phone on silent to avoid distraction. \n\nSo I made the drive for home and pulled into the parking lot. I opened my phone and started watching tik tok for around 25-30min. I just needed some alone time before going inside due to having a stressful week and needing time to de compress. My boyfriend texted me asking where I was and why I was taking so long so I responded and told him I was sitting in my car and that I was heading inside in a few minutes, it was then that I noticed I missed a call from him while I was driving (idk why I didn\u2019t see this when I was on Tik tok but I just didn\u2019t see a missed call notification) I didn\u2019t think anything of it and when I came inside my boyfriend was annoyed with me and told me I\u2019m inconsiderate for sitting in my car because he was waiting for me to come home. Now we live together so I didn\u2019t see the problem to having some alone time before coming inside and I explained to him I just needed some time alone before coming inside. He proceeded to stop talking to me and would just ignore me whenever I tried talking to him so I sat in the other room for about 30 min and texted him asking him to talk to me. He then said he was gonna go for a walk with his friend and would be back in an hour or two. I was fine with this and the day ended pretty much unresolved. \n\nToday I had to cancel a blood test for early in the morning due to financial issues so i called my boyfriend who was still in bed and told him I canceled the appointment and that i was in the parking lot. since I was up so early I decided to take another 30 to myself in the car. When I came back my boyfriend told me that I\u2019m getting on his nerves with sitting in my car and I asked him why and he said he was still upset that we didn\u2019t see eachother that much yesterday, I proceed to tell him that I only took 30min to myself and that we could\u2019ve still hung out and did something but he decided to ignore me once I was home and then hung out with his friend. He then said he was also annoyed I \u201cignored\u201d his call and I told him I was driving and didn\u2019t see it and then he told me that it\u2019s not fair that I get upset when he doesn\u2019t answer my calls (literally because it\u2019s when he\u2019s at home doing nothing and I still don\u2019t even get that mad just slightly annoyed) and he called me a hypocritical brat.

It's one thing to be worried about you and want to check in, but it's another to act entitled to your time and get upset about you taking a half hour alone to decompress, especially since he decided to punish you with the silent treatment. You two definitely need to figure out how to communicate better and he needs to respect your need for time alone.", "NTA. I don't think you're being a brat at all.

Which, to me, made perfect sense.\n\nHe would hang out and walk outside the house before coming in and that bothered me not because he did that but because it was hurtful that he didn't feel comfortable in his own home and it was upon me to correct that.\n\nSo now, when he gets home from work (I WFH), I wait for him to unwind and come say hi to me.

Seems borderline insane to me. It seems at that point that you are trying to avoid him, or trying to piss him off. \n\nIf you need a few minutes to decompress, do it like a normal person. Go inside, say hello to him, tell him you need a few minutes, go into your bedroom and take a few minutes. Then go outside and spend time with him. \n\nDon\u2019t hide in your car without telling him like a weirdo.

That said, you should get in the habit of checking your phone for missed calls and texts soon after reaching your destination. Maybe something time-sensitive came through and you need to deal with it ASAP, even if you\u2019re exhausted. Maybe it\u2019s not critical, but, like your boyfriend\u2019s text, should at least be acknowledged: \u201cHey hun, I\u2019m wiped out from work and need to take a little time to recharge \u2014 I\u2019ll be in shortly and would love to spend time with you then \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\nOne of the most important things the pandemic taught my partner and me is that expressing the need for some alone time is *totally okay*.

I think you handled the situation more maturely than he did. But you definitely need to be more proactive with communicating your need for alone time, because if I were in his shoes, I would feel like you were avoiding spending time with me.

You both need to work on communication. I will add one more thing. I experienced a similar thing in a relationship where I would sit in my car for anywhere up to an hour before finally getting home.\n\nIn my situation I realised that I no longer enjoyed being with my partner and would look for reasons to delay going home even after a busy shift because it felt like I couldn't decompress after work in his presence. His presence actually stressed me out! I would sit in my work car park for 30 mins, then drive home, then sit at the top of my road (out of sight of the house) for up to 1hr before going home.\n\nThis eventually led to me breaking up with him as it wasn't fair to either of us.\n\nFigure out what the issues are and communicate with your bf. If you just need some time where you get home and have silence for 45 mins (no questions about your day or him telling about his day), tell him that. Some of us need private time to just switch from 'work'mode to 'at home' mode and that's ok. \n\nUse your words.

But I know that while I can greet him when he comes in, maybe a few minutes of chit chat, mostly I'm going to just let him mess around in the other room by himself until he joins me. I know that he needs that because he has told me.\n\nEven if it's not something you need daily, you can just text when you park. 'Hey babe, I'm home, I'll be up in a bit, I just need some quiet alone time.'\n\nAnd don't listen to these people who think there's something wrong with the relationship because you want to relax alone. Sometimes you just need some time without even the possibility of interruption.", "YTA \nIf you needed time you should\u2019ve communicated that with your partner. After 30 minutes had passed since you were supposed to be home and you never returned a call- it\u2019s not hard to check for messages when you pull in before getting on social media- he was worried, only to find out you\u2019d been avoiding him. \nEveryone is entitled to time to themselves, but it needs to be communicated. You gave him a scare and just expected him to be ok after probably thinking the worst had happened to you!  \nAnd to him, it most certainly would seem like you\u2019re avoiding him since you wouldn\u2019t come inside and didn\u2019t return his call when you hadn\u2019t let him know that you needed some me time. It also wouldn\u2019t kill you to come home and then arrange for your own time once it\u2019s known everyone is home safe.", "NTA And I have no idea why some people are so up in arms about this. My husband does this almost every single day. He'll pull up in the driveway and goof off on his phone for a while after his long day and his long drive. This doesn't bother me in the slightest, I like my alone time for a little bit too. Life is stressful, work is stressful and he just wants to sit in his own space for 15 minutes and watch TikTok or YouTube or whatever without anyone else around. This isn't a big deal.", "Exactly. If my husband says he's leaving, I know in my head about what time he should get home. If it got to be 30 minutes passed that time and I had not heard from him I would start to get worried, especially if he had not returned my call. If I then found out he had been sitting outside for the past 30 minutes playing on his phone, I would be livid. Need some time to yourself after you get home, fine. Check in and THEN go to a different room or back out to your car.

Maybe explaining that as part of the reason could help him understand where you're coming from.", "NTA. I've done the same.  It's quiet.", "In a previous job, I would sometimes come home so frazzled from my coworkers that I could hardly deal with the *dog* wanting attention from me, let alone a human.

I feel like instead of being upset that a significant other wants a little time in their cars and making it about me, I would see what I can do to help make them feel more comfortable for when they come home.
