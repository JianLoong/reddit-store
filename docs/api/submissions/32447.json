I know he\u2019s the one i want to spend the rest of my life with, but lately I believe whatever his mom or sister ask of him, even if its something TOTALLY non urgent, comes before an urgency of mine, and I dont know how to feel about it. \nInsight, my mom recently passed away, ran over by a bus, all over the news, I can\u2019t go to the store without some rando neighbor coming up to me to talk about it or about my mom, my dad and gm also already passed so its been very hard, I\u2019m basically alone now.   \n Ev time I ask him to go with me to do sum kind of ppwork regarding her death, he always has something to do in his house with his mom, and this things don\u2019t always make sense.\nHis mom had a hernia fixed about the same time my mom passed, few weeks ago. Keep in mind he has 2 sisters and a DAD.\nThe other day I had to go to the scholarship office and explain why I\u2019ve been absent for so long during midterm and ask for them to take my situation into consideration and not take the scholarship away.\nI asked him to go with me since I KNEW I was going to cry, every time I talk about the accident I feel like I won\u2019t be able to stop crying , so I didnt want to be alone.

He didnt go with me because he was doing the laundry.\nI asked him if his sister couldn\u2019t have hanged the clothes when she got there, which ironically wouldve been a lil after the laundry was done. He said \u201cNo, because I wanted to finish everything, she\u2019s my mom\u201d. \nWe had anargument about this and I ended up being the one getting mad for everything, as always. \n\nToday it happened again, he hasnt been coming to see me as often because he\u2019s on finals, so I asked him if after his last exam he was going to come spend the night, as he used to do before finals and his moms procedure and he said, SOnonchalantly \u201cOh no, my mom told me to go pick up a christmas basket\".\nThis is where I want to know if iata, I got upset at the fact that a christmas basket was more important to him than me, just because his mom told him to , hedidn\u2019t even try to compromise and ask if he could pick it up before or the day after or sum, he just said \u201cok\u201d without thinking about me for a single moment. Asked him if his sister couldn\u2019t go pick it up \u201cIdk, didnt ask, I think she\u2019s going out\u201d, idk, cant she like pick it up before or after going out?, bc once he goes to their house he won\u2019t be able to come to mine, since he doesnt have a car & we don't have buses at night.\n\nSo please aita?\n\nEdit: he know I need him to stay the night most times since its just too much lately, all of their stuff here without them and its nice having him here by my side when I feel like I cant take it anymore\n\nEdit2: he\u2019s a good man and a good bf, he has shown it time and time again before this, its just now that my mom\u2019s death and his moms procedure happened so close to the other that he doesn\u2019t seem to know when to prioritize whom and where he should draw a line, he believes that honoring his mom and giving her the world is the least he could do after she raised him, and even though he has his sisters and dad he wants to do every chore by himself bc he\u2019s the son and he should be able to do it because he\u2019s just focusing on his last subject and thesis at the moment (not working but also w/full ride scholarship ), so he feels he has to make up for it.", "created_utc": 1701842299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bxdm2/aita_for_getting_upset_bc_my_boyfriend_puts/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His mom may have raised him, but you will eventually become his family - and he needs to know that before any vows are said.\n\nBack to my ex - we were in our early 20s and he was such a momma's boy. We were 'in the act' and his phone rang. He has a specific ring tone for his mother. He stopped to pick it up and then just packed up and left saying his mom said he had to clean his room. Mind you we were right in the middle of 'the act' and I just laid there dumfounded. We broke up. Around that time my best friend died and he was more wanting to have me meet his family then concerned for my grief.
