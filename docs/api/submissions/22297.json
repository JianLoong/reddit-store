My parents were very much involved with supporting our family and babysat our first born when my wife went back to work. \n\nMy brother and his wife are having their baby in a month. My brother is the golden child of our family where he was pampered as a child, teen, and still now. We all have decent jobs but the thought of daycare is costly and the complaint of \u201cmy child is always sick\u201d from our friends is not appealing to my wife and I. \n\nWe were having dinner at our place when my brother says \u201cwhen our baby is born I need all the help we can get\u201d we questioned what he means by that and he clarified that his expectation was that my parents were to be at his place to support his family whenever they need them. I said, \u201cwell we\u2019re going to need them as well at some point and that I expected us to work together whenever we need support\u201d. My dad then stepped in and said \u201cwell you had us for (name of first child). Now it\u2019s time for your brother and his family to get the support\u201d we went back and forth about it where I explained that it doesn\u2019t matter because he didn\u2019t have a child at the time and now that they will have three grandchildren it wouldn\u2019t be fair to just neglect my two children for his. Ill also add that my in-laws also help whenever we need it and our expectation is not to pawn our children off to the grandparents. \n\nAs you can imagine it got heated, his wife has always been very vocal with our family, so she chimed in pretty much reiterating what my dad said. (Context: she\u2019s expecting to be a stay at home mom). My wife didn\u2019t say much because this was a discussion we\u2019ve had in the past however I was hopeful this wouldn\u2019t be the case. I pretty much summed it up by saying \u201cWell if that\u2019s going to be the case, we won\u2019t ask for your help and it\u2019s sad that my kids won\u2019t be seeing their grandparents anymore\u201d my mom was upset with the comment and tried to calm me down and asked for me to not to say something so hurtful. I responded by saying that she\u2019s right, I wouldn\u2019t say anything hurtful and to prevent that they should all leave and we would see them when we see them. When they left my wife pulled the \u201cI told you\u201d on me. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1689423783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150aori/aita_keeping_my_kids_away_from_my_parents/", "score": 16, "replies": ["YTA\n\nYou are acting very entitled.  Now that your brother is having a baby, you suddenly feel it's going to impact on your baby sitting rights.\n\nIf your brother was truly the golden child, your parents would likely not have done any baby sitting at all for you... and then suddenly been available to the brother.  That is not what you are describing.\n\nYou're being very manipulative by saying that you'll not your allow your children to spend any time with their grandparents if they don't baby sit.", "ESH this is one of the (many) reasons I\u2019ve kind of written off having kids. I\u2019m not the favorite and after watching my parents turn their life upside down for my sibling\u2019s children, I didn\u2019t want to have to see how little they\u2019d care to help with mine.  But OP, I had to admit, there are logical reasons for it too - your parents are getting older. They will naturally be able to do less overall and it would be disfavoring your brothers\u2019 kids if they didn\u2019t give them close to the same attention yours got. It should go both ways while also remembering that it is voluntary help, not an obligation. And that they may genuinely not be able to handle the physical burden of chasing toddlers.", "I honestly feel like you started it. Your dad is right technically. Your parents help wasn\u2019t an issue when you were the only one receiving it. Now that brother is having his new baby, it\u2019s a problem for your parents to help the newborn? I\u2019m leaning towards Y T A but I\u2019ll say ESH because having your parents help is a privilege not a right. You and your brother are entitled.\n\nEdit: also the context you added about your sister in law, that\u2019s kinda shady. She\u2019s a first time mom, she\u2019ll probably need help. Her planning on becoming a stay at home has nothing to do with getting accustomed to a new baby in the house.", "YTA\n\nManipulative cruel and entitled.\n\nIt's your parents I am concerned about. What about their lives? It sounds like you and your brother treat them like doormats.", "Sorry YTA here. Your parents didn't owe you the help that gave you with your first child and they certainly don't owe you help for your second one. If this is your brother's first child then they may need more help than you because you have experience already.\n\nYou're even more of an AH for using access to your children as blackmail to get more attention from your mommy and daddy. They sound like they are being fair and you're still caught up in the childhood dynamic you had with your brother.\n\nMostly I feel sorry for your parents who have two children treating them like built-in babysitters instead of just letting them enjoy being grandparents.", "ESH. Of course when you have a newborn and especially if it's your first one, you'll appreciate all the help you can get. But DEMANDING to get help, like your brother does, is not cool. And when the kid grows older and has Mum staying at home all the time, there will be far less need for help. \n\nFurthermore, if there are more grandchildren, it's no more than reasonable that the grandparents divide their attention between all three. Again, it's not uncommon to spend more time with the new baby at first, but once every family has settled into their routines, the grandparents who are willing to help, should help out the family that needs it most, not the famliy that has the loudest voice. That doens't mean they should ignore one family in favour of the other, it just means they should divide their time in the way that fits everyone best.", ">My parents were very much involved with supporting our family and babysat our first born when my wife went back to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Well if that\u2019s going to be the case, we won\u2019t ask for your help and it\u2019s sad that my kids won\u2019t be seeing their grandparents anymore\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if your parents don't agree to be your on-call nannies, then you'll torpedo their relationship with their grandkids? What a complete and total AH you are. Just unbelievably entitled and ungrateful. YTA", "YTA. You are acting like the entitled brat here. It sounds like your parents provided extended and excellent free support and child for your kids up until now, and your thanks is to deny them all access to your children because they want to do the same for your sibling? As if their labor is your given right? Wow. Talk about being ungrateful.", "Yta.  Threatening to withhold your kids is always an asshole move.  Seems like your parents want to do for your brother what they did for you, that\u2019s not unreasonable.  Sounds like you are bitter about losing your free babysitting.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nRaise your own kids. Your parents are not your free childcare service.\n\nThey were extremely generous to provide free childcare for your first child. Now they are being extremely generous to provide free childcare for your brother's first child. Expecting them to become a daycare center for three small children, including two infants, is insane. You need to do what most parents out there do, and put your kids into daycare. Or if you don't want to do that, you or your wife can stay home with the kids for a year or two until they're a little bit older, then reenter the workforce. But these are your kids to raise, not your parents' kids. They already did their time. And pulling the \"I'll hold the kids hostage and you'll never see them again\" card is a jerk move.", "ESH, the two brothers anyway.  You and your brother are nigh middle-aged and still vying for mom and dad\u2019s attention like greedy puppies after the same nipple.", "YTA. It sounds like your bitterness on how your parents treated your brother growing up is leaking out right now. Your kids did nothing to your parents so why keep them from your parents because of your relationship with them? That's not fair. And your brother isn't wrong for wanting as much help as he can get with his kid.", "I had to double-check the ages just now. This reads like you're all two decades younger. Your parents don't owe you or anyone free childcare. And them helping your brother with one child exactly like they did for you isn't any proof that he's the golden child, it's evening things out. Your dad was spot on. And now you've had a tantrum. Wow, YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't ask.", "YTA: Your parents were there and supported you and your wife when you had your first child. It seems like this is more about jealousy with your brother. Why punish your parents or give them any attitude at all when they helped you so much. Just because they won't be there to support you constantly anymore doesn't negate the fact that they were there and will likely continue to help out here and there. It's only fair that your brother and his wife get some of the help and attention as first time parents. You have already done this and know the ropes where as first time parents generally need all the help they can get until they get the hang of it. Shouldn't your niece or nephew also get time with your parents? This just all seems so selfish to me.", "This is about the free babysitting.  Op mentions daycare is costly and hearing \u201cmy kid is sick\u201d all the time from friends is just not appealing to them.  It\u2019s very entitled to consider free babysitting quality time with the grandkids when they are doing you a huge favor.  Threatening to withhold the kids when they can no longer be at your beck and call is just a dick move."]}
