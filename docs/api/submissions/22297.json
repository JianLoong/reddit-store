My parents were very much involved with supporting our family and babysat our first born when my wife went back to work. \n\nMy brother and his wife are having their baby in a month. My brother is the golden child of our family where he was pampered as a child, teen, and still now. We all have decent jobs but the thought of daycare is costly and the complaint of \u201cmy child is always sick\u201d from our friends is not appealing to my wife and I. \n\nWe were having dinner at our place when my brother says \u201cwhen our baby is born I need all the help we can get\u201d we questioned what he means by that and he clarified that his expectation was that my parents were to be at his place to support his family whenever they need them. I said, \u201cwell we\u2019re going to need them as well at some point and that I expected us to work together whenever we need support\u201d. My dad then stepped in and said \u201cwell you had us for (name of first child). Now it\u2019s time for your brother and his family to get the support\u201d we went back and forth about it where I explained that it doesn\u2019t matter because he didn\u2019t have a child at the time and now that they will have three grandchildren it wouldn\u2019t be fair to just neglect my two children for his. Ill also add that my in-laws also help whenever we need it and our expectation is not to pawn our children off to the grandparents. \n\nAs you can imagine it got heated, his wife has always been very vocal with our family, so she chimed in pretty much reiterating what my dad said. (Context: she\u2019s expecting to be a stay at home mom). My wife didn\u2019t say much because this was a discussion we\u2019ve had in the past however I was hopeful this wouldn\u2019t be the case. I pretty much summed it up by saying \u201cWell if that\u2019s going to be the case, we won\u2019t ask for your help and it\u2019s sad that my kids won\u2019t be seeing their grandparents anymore\u201d my mom was upset with the comment and tried to calm me down and asked for me to not to say something so hurtful. I responded by saying that she\u2019s right, I wouldn\u2019t say anything hurtful and to prevent that they should all leave and we would see them when we see them. When they left my wife pulled the \u201cI told you\u201d on me. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\nUPDATE: I appreciate all of the feedback on this! I left some details out. This happened two weeks ago. My wife pulled the \u201cI told you\u201d but I left out that she was upset and felt that I went to far. She went on to message my mom and dad. I too have been in touch with my family to iron this all out. \n\nFor the record my parents are retired and are insistent on taking care of the kids for the 3-4 hrs my wife and I are at work when between my first and second child. We also alternate with my in laws so that they spend some quality time with them without the parents helicoptering around. For you parents, you know about this. \n\nThere are some ridiculous comments but we do raise our children to be respectful human beings and are not \u201cpawning off\u201d our parental duties.\n\nAs for my brother and I\u2019s relationship, it upset me because I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of how I feel my kids would feel if most of the attention would be going to his child. If you don\u2019t know the feeling, it does suck. My intent of my reaction was to have an equal opportunity but the reaction that I interpreted was, like many of you have said, you got your turn now it\u2019s his turn without the consideration of my children who enjoy spending time with my parents. \n\nJust thought I\u2019d ad my perspective.\n\nUPDATE #2: I\u2019m reading a lot of comments about entitlement, ungrateful, and expect my parents to drop everything they\u2019re doing to babysit my kids! That\u2019s far from my relationship from my parents. First off we are of Filipino decent, for context. Both my brother and I were raised to stretch a dollar as far as possible, not to worry about labels and to save for the future. One of us took that advice. When both my brother and I got married to our significant other, my parents asked about grand children and did not want us wasting our money on daycare because they wanted to be the one to take care of them when we were at working. The way we looked at it was why pay someone to take care of our children when we can have generations of knowledge from both me and my wife as well as my parents to pass on. \n\nSecondly, I understand my brother and his wife are going to need support. My parents as well as their in laws and me and my wife wouldn\u2019t be there for them and not provide them support. The reason why I blew up is because the conversation that happened and the words that were coming out that both my brother and dad made me feel that there would be no time for my kids to spend with their grandparents unless it was a special occasion. I left this out but my dad said \u201cIt\u2019s not like we won\u2019t see them anymore, there\u2019s birthdays Christmas etc\u201d that\u2019s when I got heated. \n\nI appreciate the responses. Some of you \n are absolute assholes for your responses. My impression of the AITA is to get feedback on a specific incident. Some of the comments are judging me as a person while not knowing me. I know the type of person, son, husband and father I am which is more than capable of raising two intelligent strong respectful men who will contribute to society. They will also be taught to stick up for things that they may not feel is right and if they are wrong in how they approach it, like I was in this instance, I will take it as a learning opportunity.", "created_utc": 1689423783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150aori/aita_keeping_my_kids_away_from_my_parents/", "score": 158, "replies": ["YTA\n\nYou are acting very entitled.

That is not what you are describing.\n\nYou're being very manipulative by saying that you'll not your allow your children to spend any time with their grandparents if they don't baby sit.", "ESH this is one of the (many) reasons I\u2019ve kind of written off having kids. I\u2019m not the favorite and after watching my parents turn their life upside down for my sibling\u2019s children, I didn\u2019t want to have to see how little they\u2019d care to help with mine.  But OP, I had to admit, there are logical reasons for it too - your parents are getting older. They will naturally be able to do less overall and it would be disfavoring your brothers\u2019 kids if they didn\u2019t give them close to the same attention yours got. It should go both ways while also remembering that it is voluntary help, not an obligation. And that they may genuinely not be able to handle the physical burden of chasing toddlers.", "I honestly feel like you started it. Your dad is right technically. Your parents help wasn\u2019t an issue when you were the only one receiving it. Now that brother is having his new baby, it\u2019s a problem for your parents to help the newborn? I\u2019m leaning towards Y T A but I\u2019ll say ESH because having your parents help is a privilege not a right. You and your brother are entitled.\n\nEdit: also the context you added about your sister in law, that\u2019s kinda shady. She\u2019s a first time mom, she\u2019ll probably need help. Her planning on becoming a stay at home has nothing to do with getting accustomed to a new baby in the house.", "YTA\n\nManipulative cruel and entitled.\n\nIt's your parents I am concerned about. What about their lives? It sounds like you and your brother treat them like doormats.", "Sorry YTA here. Your parents didn't owe you the help that gave you with your first child and they certainly don't owe you help for your second one. If this is your brother's first child then they may need more help than you because you have experience already.\n\nYou're even more of an AH for using access to your children as blackmail to get more attention from your mommy and daddy. They sound like they are being fair and you're still caught up in the childhood dynamic you had with your brother.\n\nMostly I feel sorry for your parents who have two children treating them like built-in babysitters instead of just letting them enjoy being grandparents.", "ESH. Of course when you have a newborn and especially if it's your first one, you'll appreciate all the help you can get. But DEMANDING to get help, like your brother does, is not cool. And when the kid grows older and has Mum staying at home all the time, there will be far less need for help. \n\nFurthermore, if there are more grandchildren, it's no more than reasonable that the grandparents divide their attention between all three. Again, it's not uncommon to spend more time with the new baby at first, but once every family has settled into their routines, the grandparents who are willing to help, should help out the family that needs it most, not the famliy that has the loudest voice. That doens't mean they should ignore one family in favour of the other, it just means they should divide their time in the way that fits everyone best.", ">My parents were very much involved with supporting our family and babysat our first born when my wife went back to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Well if that\u2019s going to be the case, we won\u2019t ask for your help and it\u2019s sad that my kids won\u2019t be seeing their grandparents anymore\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if your parents don't agree to be your on-call nannies, then you'll torpedo their relationship with their grandkids?

Your parents are not your free childcare service.\n\nThey were extremely generous to provide free childcare for your first child. Now they are being extremely generous to provide free childcare for your brother's first child. Expecting them to become a daycare center for three small children, including two infants, is insane. You need to do what most parents out there do, and put your kids into daycare. Or if you don't want to do that, you or your wife can stay home with the kids for a year or two until they're a little bit older, then reenter the workforce.

It's only fair that your brother and his wife get some of the help and attention as first time parents.
