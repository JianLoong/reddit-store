Honestly, we\u2019re kind of that house anyway. I feel there\u2019s always some kids over, even just to hang out during the day. I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m a single dad, my daughter is an only child. So long as the kids are respectful and their parents are cool with it, let them raid the fridge and chill. \n\nMy daughter met a new friend, a neighborhood girl that\u2019s the same age as her. We\u2019ll call her Monica. Monica\u2019s parents are a little stricter, which I respect.\n\nMy daughter had another sleepover on the 4th. Monica was among the group. I took the girls to watch some fireworks then took them home and left them to do whatever. Around 9, I heard some bickering and headed into the den where they were. Monica said she wanted to go to bed. The other girls kept saying they weren\u2019t tired. They honestly stay up pretty late. Monica said she had a strict bedtime and liked to stick to it. I came up with the compromise that if Monica wanted to go to bed, she could sleep in my daughter\u2019s room (the girls usually sleep in the living room) while the rest had fun. Monica was clearly a little disappointed that they weren\u2019t going to stop the fun for her but agreed. I went back to what I was doing.\n\nA half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud. My daughter said that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect them to censor themselves. I tried to stay out of it but eventually went in there and asked to speak to my daughter privately. She said she wanted Monica to go home. I said alright, made Monica grab her stuff and walked her home. Monica was once again upset.\n\nMonica\u2019s parents are angry with me. They claim the girls should\u2019ve just gone to bed early once. My daughter doesn\u2019t even go to bed at 9 on school nights, let alone in the summer at a sleepover. I said it wasn\u2019t fair to expect the girls to stop their fun or stay quiet. I suggested maybe Monica isn\u2019t ready for sleepovers. This didn\u2019t help. My daughter \n does admit she didn\u2019t tell Monica that they usually stay up pretty late, but also said she thought it was common knowledge that sleepovers are like that.\n\nSo, am I wrong for having Monica leave without trying to problem solve more?", "created_utc": 1688667138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sh5l1/aita_for_sending_a_girl_home/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a bunch of 12 year olds.  They can stay up for a damn sleep over.  NTA  I'm not sure what else you could have done other than let the girls bicker all night, ruining everyone's time.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the strictly raised.", "NTA, it does indeed seem like she isn't ready for sleepovers or AT LEAST has different needs / preferences for a sleepover. You / your daughter were hosting and it was unreasonable to expect the party to be shut down at 9pm. The original compromise made sense but that seemed inadequate to Monica - who sounds like a pretty overbearing and unpleasant child to be chastising her peers like that. \n\nThe only thing I wonder is if you'd given Monica like one more chance, maybe by saying something like \"Hey Monica, we don't want to send you home but we can't just shut down the party so, do you want to go to bed here despite the noise or would you rather go home?\". But honestly, this was probably a good and needed lesson for both Monica and her parents. If they're going to be that rigid and uncooperative while *guests at someone else's home*, it's probably a situation they should avoid.", "NTA the parents would have been mad when Monica complained about the fun not ending for her regardless.", "NTA\n\nGuests don't get to set the rules for everyone else.  Going to bed at 9 is pretty early, especially in the summer (a lot of places its still light out).  That's not the norm, and Monica needs to realize that, and also learn that when she goes different places, there are always going to be different rules, and she needs to learn to adjust and be more flexible, not everything is always going to happen just how she likes it... could be a good learning experience.  They're only a couple of years away from high school and people are going to be staying up a lot later.", "NTA Monica shouldn't be going to sleepovers if she's not comfortable with how they work", "NTA. Sleepovers are indeed like that. Any kid who can't handle missing a few hours sleep can't go to sleepovers, period. And for a 12 year-old to be desperate for sleep by 9/9:30 during a slumber party? Good grief.", ">A half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud.\n\nPfft girl bye. Monica seems a bit entitled and apparently the apple didn't fall far from the tree. \n\nI applaud you for initially not getting involved and then stepping in when you needed too and sticking with your daughter.\n\nOh NTA btw.", "NTA - I think making everyone go to bed early because of Monica would risk making the other girls resentful of her. Staying up late is a staple of sleepovers and if Monica can't adopt that norm, then the burden is on her and her parents to either work around it or stay home. You sound like a great father.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to let it settle it for themselves, came up with a good compromise, spoke to your daughter privately and returned Monica home safely\n\nI feel bad for Monica. I remember the sleepover I had at 11 where my mom rented Predator and one of the kids said he wasn't allowed to watch Rated R movies. We watched Batteries Not Included and Ronald was never invited to a party again", "NTA 100%. I thought you handled it very well. Sleepovers means staying up late;  that's part of it as most parents find out. Monica's not at fault since clearly it was her first sleepover, but her parents are totally in the wrong for being upset; it IS common knowledge how sleepovers work.", "NTA.  Walking someone home solved the problem of mismatched bed-time norms and routines. Monica and her parents were in the wrong by insisting that your home and that your guests adopt the rules and norms that apply at their home.", "Your house, your rules. You gave Monica an option to appease her sleep schedule and she was still unhappy with it. Her home is the best place for her to sleep soundly and you safely walked her there. Monica's parents have no right to get upset at you for... not policing *your* own daughter based on *their* rules? Damn. NTA.", "nta, provided good opportunity for experience for your child and other children, stepped in when needed, offered compromise and when unavailable saw to a solution. Were there other options? Sure, but in the end there was still lessons that needed to be learned for both Monica and her parents.", "NAH you did everything right. But everyone saying NTA is saying Monica is TA. She\u2019s a 12 year old who is in a new social situation and it sounds like her upbringing has been extremely strict and rigid. I feel sorry for her", "Yeah, Monica's not ready for sleepovers and when your daughter didn't want Monica there anymore, that pretty much settles it. NTA.", "Nta. The rules of one shouldn't affect a whole group, you guys tried to accommodate her sleeping but she didn't want it. That's on her.", "NTA\n\nYou came up with a great solution but it didn't work.

For her to demand other go to bed at 9:00 then to go off on them for still having fun without her, maybe if this was her home but she was a guest at the party.  She wanted to sleep so you walked her home where she could sleep. Her parents were out of line for saying that the girls should have all just gone to bed.  You were totally wright the Monica is not mature enough for sleepovers.  It may be better for your daughter to back away from Monica as a friend.  I see issues with her parents and their approach to raising kids.", "NTA\n\nIt's yours and your daughters house.

They'd have been miserable, fed up, and having no fun. \n\nMy girl has sleepovers too and I'm genuinely lucky if they nod off by midnight. Thankfully her friends are a great bunch and very respectful, they're just the epitome of night owls.

Only to discover that they were planning on watching horror movies all night (which I wasn\u2019t allowed to watch, and also didn\u2019t want to watch because my nightmares are vivid enough without extra fuel, thank you very much). \n\nI did not demand everyone else watched PG movies and go to bed early. \n\nInstead, I hung out in my friend\u2019s bedroom, reading books off her bookshelf, while they watched movies. I\u2019d go hang out with them in between movies, or when they paused for snack breaks.

I\u2019m not saying your daughter should have suffered so this other kid could learn a lesson, but it could have been a teaching moment for BOTH of them: for Monica, that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, and for your daughter, that when you are hosting a get-together, it\u2019s about trying to make everyone feel included AND having a good time (again, I totally get why she wanted Monica to go home.

It seems like maybe she was trying to play without knowing the rules, if that makes sense- like nobody had explained or demonstrated the difference between being at home and being a guest in someone else\u2019s house.

So the alternative was to let them problem solve themselves. Ask the girls downstairs to be quieter so that Monica can sleep. Your daughter was the host. This was a lesson for her on how to be a gracious host to guests with different needs/requests. Give the other girl some headphones or something to drown out the noise of the girls downstairs. But, essentially, unless things have escalated and one of the kids is asking to go home, going home in the middle of the night usually isn't an option for a sleepover and not the one I would jump to lightly."]}
