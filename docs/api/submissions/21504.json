Honestly, we\u2019re kind of that house anyway. I feel there\u2019s always some kids over, even just to hang out during the day. I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m a single dad, my daughter is an only child. So long as the kids are respectful and their parents are cool with it, let them raid the fridge and chill. \n\nMy daughter met a new friend, a neighborhood girl that\u2019s the same age as her. We\u2019ll call her Monica. Monica\u2019s parents are a little stricter, which I respect.\n\nMy daughter had another sleepover on the 4th. Monica was among the group. I took the girls to watch some fireworks then took them home and left them to do whatever. Around 9, I heard some bickering and headed into the den where they were. Monica said she wanted to go to bed. The other girls kept saying they weren\u2019t tired. They honestly stay up pretty late. Monica said she had a strict bedtime and liked to stick to it. I came up with the compromise that if Monica wanted to go to bed, she could sleep in my daughter\u2019s room (the girls usually sleep in the living room) while the rest had fun. Monica was clearly a little disappointed that they weren\u2019t going to stop the fun for her but agreed. I went back to what I was doing.\n\nA half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud. My daughter said that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect them to censor themselves. I tried to stay out of it but eventually went in there and asked to speak to my daughter privately. She said she wanted Monica to go home. I said alright, made Monica grab her stuff and walked her home. Monica was once again upset.\n\nMonica\u2019s parents are angry with me. They claim the girls should\u2019ve just gone to bed early once. My daughter doesn\u2019t even go to bed at 9 on school nights, let alone in the summer at a sleepover. I said it wasn\u2019t fair to expect the girls to stop their fun or stay quiet. I suggested maybe Monica isn\u2019t ready for sleepovers. This didn\u2019t help. My daughter \n does admit she didn\u2019t tell Monica that they usually stay up pretty late, but also said she thought it was common knowledge that sleepovers are like that.\n\nSo, am I wrong for having Monica leave without trying to problem solve more?", "created_utc": 1688667138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sh5l1/aita_for_sending_a_girl_home/", "score": 1608, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a bunch of 12 year olds.  They can stay up for a damn sleep over.  NTA  I'm not sure what else you could have done other than let the girls bicker all night, ruining everyone's time.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the strictly raised.", "NTA, it does indeed seem like she isn't ready for sleepovers or AT LEAST has different needs / preferences for a sleepover. You / your daughter were hosting and it was unreasonable to expect the party to be shut down at 9pm. The original compromise made sense but that seemed inadequate to Monica - who sounds like a pretty overbearing and unpleasant child to be chastising her peers like that. \n\nThe only thing I wonder is if you'd given Monica like one more chance, maybe by saying something like \"Hey Monica, we don't want to send you home but we can't just shut down the party so, do you want to go to bed here despite the noise or would you rather go home?\". But honestly, this was probably a good and needed lesson for both Monica and her parents. If they're going to be that rigid and uncooperative while *guests at someone else's home*, it's probably a situation they should avoid.", "NTA the parents would have been mad when Monica complained about the fun not ending for her regardless.", "NTA\n\nGuests don't get to set the rules for everyone else.  Going to bed at 9 is pretty early, especially in the summer (a lot of places its still light out).  That's not the norm for 12 year olds, and Monica needs to realize that, and also learn that when she goes different places, there are always going to be different rules, and she needs to learn to adjust and be more flexible, not everything is always going to happen just how she likes it... could be a good learning experience.  They're only a couple of years away from high school and people are going to be staying up a lot later.", "NTA Monica shouldn't be going to sleepovers if she's not comfortable with how they work", "NTA. Sleepovers are indeed like that. Any kid who can't handle missing a few hours sleep can't go to sleepovers, period. And for a 12 year-old to be desperate for sleep by 9/9:30 during a slumber party? Good grief.", ">A half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud.\n\nPfft girl bye.

Staying up late is a staple of sleepovers and if Monica can't adopt that norm, then the burden is on her and her parents to either work around it or stay home. You sound like a great father.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to let it settle it for themselves, came up with a good compromise, spoke to your daughter privately and returned Monica home safely\n\nI feel bad for Monica.

We watched Batteries Not Included and Ronald was never invited to a party again", "NTA 100%. I thought you handled it very well. Sleepovers means staying up late;  that's part of it as most parents find out. Monica's not at fault since clearly it was her first sleepover, but her parents are totally in the wrong for being upset; it IS common knowledge how sleepovers work.", "NTA.  Walking someone home solved the problem of mismatched bed-time norms and routines. Monica and her parents were in the wrong by insisting that your home and that your guests adopt the rules and norms that apply at their home.", "Your house, your rules. You gave Monica an option to appease her sleep schedule and she was still unhappy with it. Her home is the best place for her to sleep soundly and you safely walked her there. Monica's parents have no right to get upset at you for... not policing *your* own daughter based on *their* rules? Damn. NTA.", "nta, provided good opportunity for experience for your child and other children, stepped in when needed, offered compromise and when unavailable saw to a solution. Were there other options?

The ancient laws of sleepovers would not be kind to Monica. Parents can over idea the laws of sleepovers but with limited success", "My friendgroup literally never did this\u2026 maybe you needed better friends lmao", "9pm Fourth of July weekend!? Like what?? My 4 year old wasn\u2019t even *home* yet at 9 pm. The fireworks had just started.", "Not my kids!!!  Lol", "Yeah, I would have expected them to let her do fun things early then pick her up at 9 so she can go to bed, if sleep is that important.", "We never did sharpies or try to make each other pee either lol but I did wake up to a melted pad of butter on my chest, and then I was awake so I got the next kid with some shaving cream and then that turned into a huge shaving cream fight which got everywhere and we spent the next two hours cleaning until like 4am so we wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. I liked my friends", "Same.  We were little shits in other ways, sure, but that sleepover space is sacred.  \ud83d\ude4f", "Op shouldn\u2019t have to soundproof a room for one child. Usually at a sleepover everyone\u2019s together. If it\u2019s too noisy for her, it\u2019s best that she went home as she did.", "I remember going to sleep at 6 am at a sleepover and being up at like 8 or 9. Those were the days.", "Or vomit from that amount of sugar.", "You could always suggest to your daughter that she could privately talk to Monica about how she made her feel in her own home, and how sleepovers with them usually go. She could say that if Monica felt comfortable to either join in the whole time or sleep in the other room without getting upset with the others that she can come over again next time. \n\nI still think NTA though.", "That sounds badass I wanna do that when I grow up (I say, already an adult)", "The hat's function is to distract you from the nakedidity, and it works wonders. Even now, we're talking about why he would be wearing a hat at night and not his birthday suit.", "Carefully.", "I was that kid. No extracurriculars if they'd make me late for my bus, no games, no trips my parents would have to pay for, no dances, not even either prom.  I hope someone rescues her before she graduates without having experienced any of the fun times.", "They did accommodate her though. I don't think the daughter was being exclusionary. They came up with a solution that enabled Monica to sleep when she wanted to; this was only ok with her as long as the others slept then as well. \n\nI actually think it's great that the daughter was able to tell her dad she wasn't happy/comfortable with Monica being there anymore since she was trying to make them do what she wanted. That's not fair on the daughter or the other guests that OPs daughter was hosting and accommodating. A fact of life is that not everyone acts the same or does the same things, and you can't force them to. This is the lesson that Monica should be taking away.\n\nYes Monica needs to learn that different houses have different rules, and that sleepovers are generally even more lenient. This isn't really OPs fault though. We also don't know if her parents have said that she needs to adhere to her bedtime regardless.", "A school friend was in that boat.  Band was OK in jr. high and there were only three concerts all year.  But her parents made her quit in HS because the band (small rural town) played at all of the football and basketball games.  She was not allowed out at night because only loose girls went to the games and hung out after dinner hours.", "Disagree. Daughter did not accommodate her because they chose not to moderate their volume while she was trying to sleep and it started an argument between the girls. If the daughter refuses to compromise she is not being a good host. She can moderate her volume for one night if she decides to invite someone new over. \n\nOP says HE came up with the solution to put Monica in the daughters room. The daughter did nothing to solve her own problem and the situation escalated. OP handled the whole problem himself which enables the daughter to avoid developing conflict-resolution skills and exclude Monica from the group by making her leave altogether. Think of how this situation could affect Monica from a childhood development standpoint. None of the girls understood her upbringing and she will probably be ostracized from future hangouts. I feel bad that she didn\u2019t know how to acclimate with house with completely different rules and daughter should\u2019ve been a bit more empathetic. I\u2019m not blaming OP, but daughter should not have free reign to make all the noise she wants when it causes conflict that disrupts OP\u2019s sleep. The solution was not to dismiss Monica completely.", "I mean yeah asking her opinion is important \n\nIt\u2019s just that being the deciding factor without much else on his end. Not a lot of guidance.\n\nI think the end result was the right choice. I just think OP went from passive to reactive without much guidance as the adult in between.", "Even when 12 year old's try to be quiet, a lot of the time they aren't as quiet as they think they are. \n\nTo me it feels like you're holding the daughter to a higher standard than Monica. She is also only 12 and a child, of course her problem and conflict resolution skills need more work. Her coming to her dad for help is a very typical 12 year old's resolution to conflict. \n\nUnderstanding someone upbringing doesn't mean that you have to follow their rules. OP has said that she is still hanging out with the other girls but doesn't know what will happen when another sleepover is planned. That is why I suggested he explain ways that his daughter could speak to Monica to figure out a way for her to be involved in another one. \n\nConsidering how shitty some kids can be, this isn't even bad. She asked her dad to help rather then asking her to leave in front of the others and they are still friends and hang out. The daughter isn't excluding her after this happened.\n\nThe girls explained how they stay up late and hang out. Monica could have been more empathetic to them as well and could have nicely asked that they quiet down a bit. She instead stormed downstairs and told them off. OP was able to sleep. It is possible that Monica was moody about them not following her lead and decided to just have a go at them, because again, they are all 12 year old kids."]}
