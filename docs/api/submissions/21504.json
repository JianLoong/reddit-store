Honestly, we\u2019re kind of that house anyway. I feel there\u2019s always some kids over, even just to hang out during the day. I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m a single dad, my daughter is an only child. So long as the kids are respectful and their parents are cool with it, let them raid the fridge and chill. \n\nMy daughter met a new friend, a neighborhood girl that\u2019s the same age as her. We\u2019ll call her Monica. Monica\u2019s parents are a little stricter, which I respect.\n\nMy daughter had another sleepover on the 4th. Monica was among the group. I took the girls to watch some fireworks then took them home and left them to do whatever. Around 9, I heard some bickering and headed into the den where they were. Monica said she wanted to go to bed. The other girls kept saying they weren\u2019t tired. They honestly stay up pretty late. Monica said she had a strict bedtime and liked to stick to it. I came up with the compromise that if Monica wanted to go to bed, she could sleep in my daughter\u2019s room (the girls usually sleep in the living room) while the rest had fun. Monica was clearly a little disappointed that they weren\u2019t going to stop the fun for her but agreed. I went back to what I was doing.\n\nA half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud. My daughter said that it wasn\u2019t fair to expect them to censor themselves. I tried to stay out of it but eventually went in there and asked to speak to my daughter privately. She said she wanted Monica to go home. I said alright, made Monica grab her stuff and walked her home. Monica was once again upset.\n\nMonica\u2019s parents are angry with me. They claim the girls should\u2019ve just gone to bed early once. My daughter doesn\u2019t even go to bed at 9 on school nights, let alone in the summer at a sleepover. I said it wasn\u2019t fair to expect the girls to stop their fun or stay quiet. I suggested maybe Monica isn\u2019t ready for sleepovers. This didn\u2019t help. My daughter \n does admit she didn\u2019t tell Monica that they usually stay up pretty late, but also said she thought it was common knowledge that sleepovers are like that.\n\nSo, am I wrong for having Monica leave without trying to problem solve more?", "created_utc": 1688667138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sh5l1/aita_for_sending_a_girl_home/", "score": 4123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a bunch of 12 year olds.  They can stay up for a damn sleep over.  NTA  I'm not sure what else you could have done other than let the girls bicker all night, ruining everyone's time.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the strictly raised.", "NTA, it does indeed seem like she isn't ready for sleepovers or AT LEAST has different needs / preferences for a sleepover. You / your daughter were hosting and it was unreasonable to expect the party to be shut down at 9pm. The original compromise made sense but that seemed inadequate to Monica - who sounds like a pretty overbearing and unpleasant child to be chastising her peers like that. \n\nThe only thing I wonder is if you'd given Monica like one more chance, maybe by saying something like \"Hey Monica, we don't want to send you home but we can't just shut down the party so, do you want to go to bed here despite the noise or would you rather go home?\". But honestly, this was probably a good and needed lesson for both Monica and her parents. If they're going to be that rigid and uncooperative while *guests at someone else's home*, it's probably a situation they should avoid.", "NTA the parents would have been mad when Monica complained about the fun not ending for her regardless.", "NTA\n\nGuests don't get to set the rules for everyone else.  Going to bed at 9 is pretty early, especially in the summer (a lot of places its still light out).  That's not the norm for 12 year olds, and Monica needs to realize that, and also learn that when she goes different places, there are always going to be different rules, and she needs to learn to adjust and be more flexible, not everything is always going to happen just how she likes it... could be a good learning experience.  They're only a couple of years away from high school and people are going to be staying up a lot later.", "NTA Monica shouldn't be going to sleepovers if she's not comfortable with how they work", "NTA. Sleepovers are indeed like that. Any kid who can't handle missing a few hours sleep can't go to sleepovers, period. And for a 12 year-old to be desperate for sleep by 9/9:30 during a slumber party? Good grief.", ">A half hour later, I hear Monica storming downstairs and chastising the other girls because they were being too loud.\n\nPfft girl bye.

Staying up late is a staple of sleepovers and if Monica can't adopt that norm, then the burden is on her and her parents to either work around it or stay home. You sound like a great father.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to let it settle it for themselves, came up with a good compromise, spoke to your daughter privately and returned Monica home safely\n\nI feel bad for Monica.

We watched Batteries Not Included and Ronald was never invited to a party again", "NTA 100%. I thought you handled it very well. Sleepovers means staying up late;  that's part of it as most parents find out. Monica's not at fault since clearly it was her first sleepover, but her parents are totally in the wrong for being upset; it IS common knowledge how sleepovers work.", "NTA.  Walking someone home solved the problem of mismatched bed-time norms and routines. Monica and her parents were in the wrong by insisting that your home and that your guests adopt the rules and norms that apply at their home.", "Your house, your rules. You gave Monica an option to appease her sleep schedule and she was still unhappy with it. Her home is the best place for her to sleep soundly and you safely walked her there. Monica's parents have no right to get upset at you for... not policing *your* own daughter based on *their* rules? Damn. NTA.", "nta, provided good opportunity for experience for your child and other children, stepped in when needed, offered compromise and when unavailable saw to a solution. Were there other options?

A fact of life is that not everyone acts the same or does the same things, and you can't force them to.

OP handled the whole problem himself which enables the daughter to avoid developing conflict-resolution skills and exclude Monica from the group by making her leave altogether. Think of how this situation could affect Monica from a childhood development standpoint. None of the girls understood her upbringing and she will probably be ostracized from future hangouts. I feel bad that she didn\u2019t know how to acclimate with house with completely different rules and daughter should\u2019ve been a bit more empathetic.

Her coming to her dad for help is a very typical 12 year old's resolution to conflict. \n\nUnderstanding someone upbringing doesn't mean that you have to follow their rules. OP has said that she is still hanging out with the other girls but doesn't know what will happen when another sleepover is planned. That is why I suggested he explain ways that his daughter could speak to Monica to figure out a way for her to be involved in another one. \n\nConsidering how shitty some kids can be, this isn't even bad. She asked her dad to help rather then asking her to leave in front of the others and they are still friends and hang out. The daughter isn't excluding her after this happened.\n\nThe girls explained how they stay up late and hang out. Monica could have been more empathetic to them as well and could have nicely asked that they quiet down a bit. She instead stormed downstairs and told them off. OP was able to sleep.

Worked pretty well, actually - no one else went as early as she did but when it got later if someone got too tired they\u2019d just go to bed, people didn\u2019t feel obligated to stay awake because other people weren\u2019t ready to sleep.", "Of course, her mother will probably turn around and pressure her the moment she graduates college about why she isn't dating anyone or when she's having kids.\n\nIt's always the same with these types of parents.", "YTA\nSorry, I don\u2019t really think you\u2019re an asshole, but good gracious man, you need to read up on teens and their social behaviors.

Even if Monika was being totally ridiculous for no reason, which as a mom to 4 daughters, I seriously doubt, your daughter must learn to be a gracious hostess. Now, Monika is out of their friend group. Likely, those girls will isolate her at school and soft bully her.

One friend's mom literally rented a motel room and made her daughter stay the night there because of some bad experiences she had as a child.
