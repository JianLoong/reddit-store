My wife and I had beforehand researched the baby gym\u2019s facilities and how it could help our baby and decided to enrol her.\n\nThe first session was last week and it was no surprise that I was the only dad there. The session was mainly an introduction and the instructor was explaining the program and its various stages. At my turn during the ice breaking I introduced myself and my daughter and told them that I was excited to see my daughter interacting and developing through this program. Other mothers asked about why my child\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t here and I simply told them she was working and couldn\u2019t be here. My wife is a neurosurgeon and was oncall almost every weekend and that day (saturday) was no different. I knew she would have liked to join since she finds the whole idea of a baby gym adorable. Some mothers and the instructor were making small talk and asking more about my wife and why she couldn\u2019t be here yet again. I just explained that she is working in healthcare (didn\u2019t tell her specific role in healthcare since I thought it didn\u2019t matter) and we can\u2019t choose our schedules most of the time.\n\nNext session was a few days ago, same thing happened. People asked why my wife wasn\u2019t here and subtly hinting that I am being emasculated by doing this. Instructor then chimed in saying \u201csurely your wife can find the time to be here and not work as nurse and maybe you can go find a job\u201d. \n\nI was taken aback by this but kept my cool. I explained that my wife is an attending neurosurgeon working in a very busy trauma centre and I am a cardiac intensivist/anaesthesiologist working in a hospital that specializes in cardiothoracic care. Since I\u2019m in a sub, i do not do regular calls nor do I need to work weekends unless an emergency case needs to be done hence why I am the primary carer for my daughter. I told her I do not appreciate her critiques about my life and especially something so stupid as gender roles. I fathered my daughter so I had a right to be here. \n\nI told this to my wife, she is furious and wants to cancel the subscription. Shes siding with me on this.\n\nI told this to my mother and she gave an interesting point that the ladies might have felt threatened for their safety sonce a man is around their babies and themselves but I have not given any kind on indication that I would be a threat to anyone and it\u2019s just absurd that they might be thinking this just because I am a man? The gym walls are made of glass so people from the outside can see. There are cctvs everywhere and every time I\u2019m there are at least 20+ people around.\n\nRuminating over this I feel bad about how I handled that and if I be apologizing instead .

WTAF man... do they think babies are literally found under a cabbage leaf and are hatched out by the sun?", "NTA. I can't stand it when women actively discourage men being fathers. Don't change who you are. Your wife and daughter are going to appreciate all the ways you show up as a parent.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything rude. Their comments were straight from the 1800s and deserve no kindness in response.", "NTA.\n\nYou said what needed to be said, and you have the same right to be present in that space as the other parents do, regardless of gender.\n\nMy advice? Take everything your mother says with a grain of salt from this point forward.", "NTA. These women need to realize it's 2023, not 1850. You are allowed to have an active role in raising your daughter. It's not 'women's work'.", "Nta\n\n\n>I told this to my mother and she gave an interesting point that the ladies might have felt threatened for their safety sonce a man is around their babies and themselves but I have not given any kind on indication that I would be a threat to anyone and it\u2019s just absurd that they might be thinking this just because I am a man?\n\nI think your mum is talking out her backside here. It MAY be that they're uncomfortable having a man in a situation where they don't typically see one and unsure how to act. Either way it doesn't excuse the way they spoke to you or how they talked about your wife.", "Unless the name of the class is like \u201cmommy baby gym\u201d they were extremely rude to you. I think you should ask for a refund and report the group to the bigger org. This went from micro-aggressions to regular aggression real quick.", "NTA. I\u2019d be asking for a refund and telling them where to shove their outdated attitudes. That\u2019s beyond belief and you were absolutely right to stand up to them.", "NTA my husband also gets weird looks when he takes our daughter out alone to kids places like the park. It\u2019s wild and weird I\u2019ve never felt uncomfortable about the presence of a dad with their child.", "I find it very offensive as a matter of fact. To suggest that you make them uncomfortable because you\u2019re a man in a baby gym and they would rather have the mother\u2019s support instead is pretty much calling you a pedofile without saying it?!. That said, I would continue to visit the gym with your daughter because now you understand it makes them uncomfortable and honestly that\u2019s not your problem", "Absolutely NTA!\n\nYou handled a sexist viewpoint with dignity and aplomb.  Your baby is lucky to have two invested and loving parents who are doing their best for them already.\n\nDad away with pride, you're doing it right.", "NTA absolutely do not apologize.  I\u2019ve always gone out of my way to be welcoming to the SAHD I met when my kids were little and the dads who were in the parents and toy classes because the moms who were being weirdos were AWFUL.  I think they were threatened by the fact that their husbands aren\u2019t as awesome as you are. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the threat.", "NTA.  You're awesome, your wife is awesome, and this is bullshit.", "NTA at all, what a strange encounter! People are sometimes surpised when they see a dad solo parenting though as in some places it's just not the norm. My husband gets given a lot of free stuff from places like the library, bakery, craft shops etc. when he takes our daughter out and about on his own and I can't tell if it's because our girl is cute or he is hot. On the plus side... I get free cakes!", "Nta and I don\u2019t think your mom is right. I seriously doubt they were afraid of you in that setting.", "NTA.  The instructor was *extremely* rude to you.  You corrected her rudeness.  That's a confrontation, but it's not you being rude.\n\nI agree with your wife, cancel, and tell the front desk why you're canceling.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a baby gym session, not a breastfeeding or mum-and-bub-specific session. There\u2019s no reason not to expect fathers to attend, and no reason to be uncomfortable with a man in the room.\n\nThey were rude and presumptuous. Glad your wife has your back. I\u2019d like to think that if I\u2019d been in the session, I\u2019d have said \u201cMy husband\u2019s working too, if anyone\u2019s curious. Otherwise he\u2019d love to be here.\u201d", "NTA. I worked at one of these gyms for years, and I always readily accepted Dad, Grandma, Uncle, Nanny, whoever to the class. Short of signs of abuse, it's not my business who is primary caregiver to the child or who happens to be available for baby classes on the specific time and day that class is scheduled for. \n\nI appreciated any parent or guardian who is there to enthusiastically play along, sing along, and guide their child through our learn by playing curriculum. \n\nI'm sorry you are dealing with anti-dad mean girls. I hated the moms who used this as their opportunity to talk shit about their husbands and gossip in a corner, instead of participating with their kids.", "NTA I take my kids to a baby gym (I agree it\u2019s adorable). I\u2019m a stay at home mom and I see tons of kids come with dad or grandpa or a male nanny. Never once have I felt uncomfortable or threatened that a male was in our class or heard someone ask where mom was and we have been going to the same baby gym for 3 years.", "NTA, the sexism here is just sad and frustrating.", "NTA, fuck that noise. I did the same sort of thing with my wee girl and yes I am a man, no one batted an eye. It's 2023 FFS.", "NTA - They way you were treated is extremely insulting. I would ask for your money back and leave a bad review.", "It\u2019s time you start asking when fathers will show up because they shouldn\u2019t be lifting anything as heavy as their own child, by same very logic.\n\nSorry, I\u2019m being intentionally mean here. You\u2019re totally NTA and the fact that instructor failed to moderate this dynamic speaks volumes of their \u201cprofessionalism\u201d.", "NTA. Please don't apologize for their sexism. That's on them. I agree with your wife, you should find a different class with an instructor who creates (and enforces) an inclusive space. That shouldn't be a big hurdle \u2014 you can't be the only active male parent in your area. (I'm rolling my eyes hard at these sexist AF busy bodies.)", "NTA. And I would pull my daughter out of that school. I\u2019m sure there are others.", "Wow. Get a refund and leave a public review. That's disgusting.", "NTA \n\nI would also leave a professional  review so other dads know to stay away. \n Your mom is also partaking in ourdated gender roles.\n\nI see no threat from a dad actively participating in his kid's life. \n\nMy dad once came home crying after he was treated rudely by the moms at a PTA meeting. I was too young to remember but my stepmother says that was one of the few times she saw him shaken.\n\nHe felt belittled and treated like a creep for being a dad wanting to sign up for field trips and be an active parent.\n\nMen are allowed in parenting spaces unless otherwise stated. It's fine to set up women only classes for abuse victims to have a safe space that wasn't the case here.", "NTA.  Those women were backward, sexist AHs.  I wouldn't blame you for canceling the class, but then your daughter would be missing out.", "NTA this is just blatant sexism.", "When my kids were babies and we did baby gym, rhymetime at library, all those classes to get out of the house to keep me from going insane stuck at home with a baby.... there were loads of dads there. In fact swimming lessons were 80% dads. Totally normal these days. Utterly ridiculous that they're \"worried for their safety\" or some other BS \nI'd be having a word to the organisers and threatening a complaint for gender discrimination. Dads are parents too, the classes are for the CHILDREN , it's irrelevant which grown up attends to supervise . Are they saying that children of single dads or gay families aren't welcome there?", "NTA. You have nothing to apologize for. They are all ignorant assholes. And they're probably the type of people that complain that their baby daddy doesn't take responsibility for the kids.", "NTA. That comment from the instructor was completely inappropriate in every way.", "NTA. You said the right thing. Her attitude was disgusting. I would un-enroll and give them feedback publicly. \n(I work with female Drs. I have had patients look to the male student Dr and ask questions on the  female Consultants ward round, when she has introduced herself as being their Consultant. And a  Dr whose patient came out and swore he\u2019d had a nurse appointment when he\u2019d been in with her over half an hour and she\u2019d said she was his Dr a couple of times. Alas, sexist attitudes to healthcare workers don\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.)", "NTA\n\n> I told this to my mother and she gave an interesting point that the ladies might have felt threatened for their safety sonce a man is around their babies and themselves but I have not given any kind on indication that I would be a threat to anyone and it\u2019s just absurd that they might be thinking this just because I am a man?\n\nYour **penis** is not a **weapon**.", "So a stranger said your wife should change jobs and you did get a job for no reason other than sexism and you aren't sure if you're an asshole?", "NTA but this reads like a fantasy. I'm the first to admit the women I know don't represent humanity, but I don't know a single woman that would act like that or assume your wife is a nurse, or assume she'd be able to just drop nursing, or try to imply you're less of a man for being the one to bring baby to the activity.\n\nIf it's real, I'm with your wife, and would stop paying money to be confronted with that bs", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not cater to these sexist AHs.", "Wow. This class is jammed solid with noxious chauvinists. And it sounds like you and your wife are quite a couple! Don\u2019t deprive your daughter of anything you want for her in order to appease these boorish women. You have every right to be there. They can take a hike. NTA", "Nonsense. This is so fake. On the offchance that it is true, I think it is OP who was feeling emasculated. I cannot imagine anyone saying *\u201csurely your wife can find the time to be here and not work as nurse and maybe you can go find a job\u201d.* Not even 50 years ago. And why couldn't he have just said \"She is an attending physician\" instead of playing coy word games? No woman I know of would have been suspicious of or felt threatened by a dad attending the gym. We all would have loved it. These are modern times when dads participate in the parenting. Certainly nobody since the 1800's would have had the vapors over the presence of a man. I assume that the gym is in the OP's neighborhood, and that if both OP and his wife are doctors, this is an upscale, educated neighborhood where gender roles have progessed in the past few centuries. \n\nIf the moms were giving off a suspicious vibe, maybe it was because OP was giving off a creepy vibe.\n\nOr maybe none of this really happened.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have your 6 month old with you clearly you are there for the right reason and having a man in the group should not be an issue.
