My wife and I had beforehand researched the baby gym\u2019s facilities and how it could help our baby and decided to enrol her.\n\nThe first session was last week and it was no surprise that I was the only dad there. The session was mainly an introduction and the instructor was explaining the program and its various stages. At my turn during the ice breaking I introduced myself and my daughter and told them that I was excited to see my daughter interacting and developing through this program. Other mothers asked about why my child\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t here and I simply told them she was working and couldn\u2019t be here. My wife is a neurosurgeon and was oncall almost every weekend and that day (saturday) was no different. I knew she would have liked to join since she finds the whole idea of a baby gym adorable. Some mothers and the instructor were making small talk and asking more about my wife and why she couldn\u2019t be here yet again. I just explained that she is working in healthcare (didn\u2019t tell her specific role in healthcare since I thought it didn\u2019t matter) and we can\u2019t choose our schedules most of the time.\n\nNext session was a few days ago, same thing happened. People asked why my wife wasn\u2019t here and subtly hinting that I am being emasculated by doing this. Instructor then chimed in saying \u201csurely your wife can find the time to be here and not work as nurse and maybe you can go find a job\u201d. \n\nI was taken aback by this but kept my cool. I explained that my wife is an attending neurosurgeon working in a very busy trauma centre and I am a cardiac intensivist/anaesthesiologist working in a hospital that specializes in cardiothoracic care. Since I\u2019m in a sub, i do not do regular calls nor do I need to work weekends unless an emergency case needs to be done hence why I am the primary carer for my daughter. I told her I do not appreciate her critiques about my life and especially something so stupid as gender roles. I fathered my daughter so I had a right to be here. \n\nI told this to my wife, she is furious and wants to cancel the subscription. Shes siding with me on this.\n\nI told this to my mother and she gave an interesting point that the ladies might have felt threatened for their safety sonce a man is around their babies and themselves but I have not given any kind on indication that I would be a threat to anyone and it\u2019s just absurd that they might be thinking this just because I am a man? The gym walls are made of glass so people from the outside can see. There are cctvs everywhere and every time I\u2019m there are at least 20+ people around.\n\nRuminating over this I feel bad about how I handled that and if I be apologizing instead .

Don't change who you are. Your wife and daughter are going to appreciate all the ways you show up as a parent.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything rude. Their comments were straight from the 1800s and deserve no kindness in response.", "NTA.\n\nYou said what needed to be said, and you have the same right to be present in that space as the other parents do, regardless of gender.\n\nMy advice? Take everything your mother says with a grain of salt from this point forward.", "NTA. These women need to realize it's 2023, not 1850.

It MAY be that they're uncomfortable having a man in a situation where they don't typically see one and unsure how to act. Either way it doesn't excuse the way they spoke to you or how they talked about your wife.", "Unless the name of the class is like \u201cmommy baby gym\u201d they were extremely rude to you.

That\u2019s beyond belief and you were absolutely right to stand up to them.", "NTA my husband also gets weird looks when he takes our daughter out alone to kids places like the park. It\u2019s wild and weird I\u2019ve never felt uncomfortable about the presence of a dad with their child.", "I find it very offensive as a matter of fact. To suggest that you make them uncomfortable because you\u2019re a man in a baby gym and they would rather have the mother\u2019s support instead is pretty much calling you a pedofile without saying it?!.

I\u2019ve always gone out of my way to be welcoming to the SAHD I met when my kids were little and the dads who were in the parents and toy classes because the moms who were being weirdos were AWFUL.

You're awesome, your wife is awesome, and this is bullshit.", "NTA at all, what a strange encounter! People are sometimes surpised when they see a dad solo parenting though as in some places it's just not the norm.

In fact swimming lessons were 80% dads. Totally normal these days. Utterly ridiculous that they're \"worried for their safety\" or some other BS \nI'd be having a word to the organisers and threatening a complaint for gender discrimination. Dads are parents too, the classes are for the CHILDREN , it's irrelevant which grown up attends to supervise . Are they saying that children of single dads or gay families aren't welcome there?", "NTA. You have nothing to apologize for. They are all ignorant assholes.

That comment from the instructor was completely inappropriate in every way.", "NTA. You said the right thing. Her attitude was disgusting. I would un-enroll and give them feedback publicly. \n(I work with female Drs.

And a  Dr whose patient came out and swore he\u2019d had a nurse appointment when he\u2019d been in with her over half an hour and she\u2019d said she was his Dr a couple of times.

I'm the first to admit the women I know don't represent humanity, but I don't know a single woman that would act like that or assume your wife is a nurse, or assume she'd be able to just drop nursing, or try to imply you're less of a man for being the one to bring baby to the activity.\n\nIf it's real, I'm with your wife, and would stop paying money to be confronted with that bs", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not cater to these sexist AHs.", "Wow. This class is jammed solid with noxious chauvinists. And it sounds like you and your wife are quite a couple! Don\u2019t deprive your daughter of anything you want for her in order to appease these boorish women. You have every right to be there. They can take a hike. NTA", "Nonsense. This is so fake. On the offchance that it is true, I think it is OP who was feeling emasculated. I cannot imagine anyone saying *\u201csurely your wife can find the time to be here and not work as nurse and maybe you can go find a job\u201d.* Not even 50 years ago. And why couldn't he have just said \"She is an attending physician\" instead of playing coy word games? No woman I know of would have been suspicious of or felt threatened by a dad attending the gym. We all would have loved it. These are modern times when dads participate in the parenting. Certainly nobody since the 1800's would have had the vapors over the presence of a man. I assume that the gym is in the OP's neighborhood, and that if both OP and his wife are doctors, this is an upscale, educated neighborhood where gender roles have progessed in the past few centuries. \n\nIf the moms were giving off a suspicious vibe, maybe it was because OP was giving off a creepy vibe.\n\nOr maybe none of this really happened.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That instructor owes you a humble apology, in my opinion.\n\nNTA\n\nI think you handled it very well and you should not feel badly about it at all. Glad your wife agrees with you as well!", "NTA, I think they were way out of bounds and I'd definitely be putting in a formal complaint with the venue/management of the class, looking elsewhere and requesting any money paid back.\n\nThere may be an element of uncomfortableness as your mother suggested but that would be a massive overreaction on the part of those initiating and it sounds more like they were being sexist, thoughtless and derogatory than concerned, neither of which are your problem.\n\nI'm not sure I'd have gotten my back up quite the same way you did, probably would've said politely but pointedly that \"wife's a neurosurgeon actually, I have a cardiac job but aren't on call as often\" and would've left it at that unless they kept pushing the matter.  Tbh, might actually have said this in the icebreaker bit but you're right that it shouldn't have been relevant.\n\nAlso, just being honest here, your own job description seems like it was intended in a bit of an AH way, however, absolutely understandable that you did react because they were being judgemental ckends tbh, massive jump to assume the OP must be unemployed if they're attending things with their child. Additionally, what if it had been something like the mother had passed or similar situation, theirs was a real s**tty way to treat someone, they were being completely rude.", "Hardest of NTAs, and the idea women would be right to be afraid to just have a man around is downright disturbing.\n\nSome of those babies will grow up to be men! All those babies will benefit from seeing involved fathers.\n\nEuuuugh forever. I'm sorry your town is apparently completely backward, if they all see men parenting as emasculating.\n\nYou keep on with your bad self, your child is lucky to have you both.", "You know you are not being rude. Why pose it as a question?\n\nI am so triggered by this post. Sounds like you kept your cool (at the start, anyways). If any stranger ever asks where my wife is, when I\u2019m with the kids by myself, my default answer is that she died in a fire. That shuts people up.", "I've read this a few times now and I genuinely cannot find any angle where you would be the AH. There is \\*nothing\\* wrong with a guy taking up what might be traditionally considered \"feminine\" activities. The instructor was a prat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo the right thing and pull your kid out of this gym. I'll be honest, you're an anaethesiologist and your wife is a neurosurgeon. I know for a fact how much your salaries roughly are, hire a private instructor if you're truly desperate to develop the kid's motor skills. Or do what other parents do and take the kid to the park and play around, socialise with other kids. NTA, you might have a couple things to discuss with your wife though.", "NTA. They were way out of line. It\u2019s none of their business. They don\u2019t get to judge you or your life. They think they can express their opinion but you can\u2019t. They can dish it out but they can\u2019t take it.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry but your mom is wrong. You aren\u2019t threatening anyone by existing in the baby gym. They weren\u2019t rude because they were scared, they were rude because they were rude.", "NTA - keep being a great dad and husband.\n\nAs far as your mother\u2019s idea of women feeling safe, I call BS. As a women who has actually been attacked physically by men in my life on more than one occasion, I find this idea feasible yet absurd. Women who feel that uncomfortable around any man ever probably ought to seek some kind of help to work on that so they can comfortably exist in the world. Not their fault, but it is their problem. If a child had two dads, would they be unwelcome because a woman couldn\u2019t come? Or a child of a single or widowed father? No. \n\nHonestly, the vast majority of women want an involved partner and co-parent, so seeing you out there being one is setting a great example to their children.\n\nAlso the instructor was rude, you were protective. There\u2019s a difference.", "Nope nope and nope, that was extremely unprofessional of the instructor and I'd absolutely be looking for a different place as I'd no longer be comfortable with that place. I used to take a young girl to these classes when I was a nanny and often seen dads there and no one ever said a thing about it. A close family friend of mine was a sahd for years because it was the agreement between him and his partner as she had the higher paying job. What your wife does is incredible and we definitely don't need her leaving her line of work especially when she's worked so hard to get there. I'd have been sooooo mad honestly.", "Yeah my husband took our daughter to play group a few times. When she was about 6 months old. He felt extremely judged and made to feel uncomfortable. I turned up once coz I could that time. She's 28 now. And don't get me started on the changing room thing. Sadly it's still a big thing and we live in New Zealand. An extremely liberal and forward thinking country \u2764\ufe0f. But yeah sexism towards men is a thing.", "When this is a over I would do an evaluation on some on- line form  ( Yelp) about the sexism evident in the staff and other parents. . B/c it would tick me off.", "You shouldn't be feeling sorry in the slightest. This is textbook misandry, These people are bigots, and I would complain to the owner of the facility (assuming it is not the instructor). I would also seriously consider finding another program, assuming that one exists.\n\nNTA times 100.", "NTA what an asinine thing for the instructor to say. BTW I am a woman that takes my toddler to a ton of classes. I would *not* feel threatened by a father and child in my class.", "NTA, this kind of casual misandry pisses me off. People will talk shit about men as fathers, suggest that they don't do enough or care enough, but when they actually take an active role in raising the child it's \"Where's mom? Oh are we babysitting today?\"  \nWhat if mom's dead? What if mom's incarcerated? What if you're one of two dads? Hell, how would they feel if they went to pay for something at the grocery store with kids in tow and were asked \"oh, where's dad? shouldn't he be paying for this? does he let you use his card?\"  It's absolutely a disgusting double standard.", "NTA. Just tell them that your wife is a Surgeon and I am doing this because you want to or just a tell them STFU.", "NTA at all \n\nIt sounds like they just aren\u2019t the crowd you want to be around. They have the \u201ctraditional\u201d views of what relationships are \u201csupposed\u201d to be. Men work, women take care of kids. Only we know from a long time of looking at is that kids are sometimes more work than an actual 9-5 with cleaning, activities they do, etc. A kid will always be better off with both parents emotionally invested. \n\nYou sound like you are and will be a great dad and I am glad some men out there also don\u2019t see the reason for these roles that we put ourselves into, for me they just limit your growth as a person. When you actively take up a singular role there is nothing for you to expand or do and you just get resentful. Lets have soccer moms and dads! My dad worked away but would always show up for my sibling and I when he was home and a lot of the time I would only see the moms at games and such. If a dad wants to be a dad let him! You guys honestly sound like a power couple go you and keep being awesome", "NTA, you weren\u2019t rude. That was an excellent explanation that hopefully gave them a wake up call on how she/they treated you.", "NTA at all, your comments regarding critique about your life and gender roles were spot on", "NTA. Maybe look into a father friendly setting.", "I'd cancel, demand a refund, and report the instructor for discrimination. She didn't just insult you for being an active father, she assumed by healthcare you meant your wife was a nurse (nothing against nurses, y'all are the greatest, but I'm sure you know what I mean). This woman is incredibly sexist and has no business being around kids.", "NTA. Your mom is grasping at straws. You were treated very poorly.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly. Those were some really brazen and disrespectful things they said to you. I\u2019m sure your mom means well but her perspective on this is likely based on what things were like when she was a young mom. I\u2019m definitely wary and cautious around men in general, but being afraid of a dad in a baby gym group is beyond absurd.", "NTA!!!! \n\ni hate this sexist rhetoric that dads are somehow lesser parents than women. \n\nyour wife was WORKING that should be a good enough reason for them! but even if she wasn\u2019t working, it\u2019s none of their business. she could be a SAHM that just wants some time to herself on a saturday while dad gets to go to a class with his baby and bond. \n\nmy fianc\u00e9 was always the only dad at my sons swimming lessons, he dealt with this too. \n\ngood on you for standing up for yourself and your wife! \n\nand thank you both for your service in healthcare, keep saving lives you beautiful legends \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nThey're being ridiculous in this day and age.", "NTA- this is some blatant sexism and you have a right to be pissed.", "NTA this is the most ridiculous thing I read in a long time. Don't give those people another thought.\n\nKeep up the good work! You and your wife seems like good parents.\n\nMay I suggest baby swimming classes instead of the gym? It is completely adorable and a good life skill for your daughter. Google \"infant self rescue\".", "NTA! Fuck anyone who can't comprehend that dads can parent, and fuck them twice over with a rusty spork for insinuating that your wife should have been there instead of you--then thrice for perpetuating ancient gender norms. I was raised by a single dad and he caught flak like this, too.", "NTA and your wife is a gem. Your mother sounds like an airhead though.", "NTA.  They\u2019re jealous of your wife for having a husband that takes a role in your child\u2019s life.  They feel threatened because it subtly reminds them that their baby daddies won\u2019t step up like you do.", "The momma's have a click that is woman oriented and your presence is a bit of a squash on that. Before your arrival they could talk about breastfeeding, cramping, bleeding, sex, baby stuff, etc. and now a man has entered the once only female arena and it changes things. NTA OP it is not you it is them.. My husband did the SAHD thing when our #2 was a baby and he inherited the mom's group when I went back to work. He would meet them at the park and socialize, go for lunch and even meet up for shopping and their husbands were okay with it as we were all friends and knew each other. There might also be the actual nosiness in your life, the fact that some of the partners might not be happy with a man in the class with their wives, etc.", "NTA - You have every right to be there. The mothers in the group are assholes for discussing what is none of their business. The instructor is an even bigger asshole for not only failing to defend your right to be there but also for joining in on the mothers' bullshit.\n\nPersonally, I think it is wonderful that you are taking such an active role in your child's upbringing.", "NTA.\n\nThat the \\*instructor\\* made that comment is especially egregious. I'd cancel the subscription, write an email to management detailing the offensive exchange, post a shorter summary of what happened on their web page and any review sites, then find a new baby gym.", "NTA at all. I wonder if you live in a conservative area bc Jesus christ, it shouldn\u2019t take an MD to understand feminism. You both have critically important jobs, the moms surely wouldn\u2019t be asking why your wife wasn\u2019t at home with her kids if god forbid they ever needed her services", "NTA. My husband takes our daughter to Gymboree by himself all the time and there are other dads doing the same thing!  Some grandmas and some Nannie\u2019s! Who cares who takes them. It\u2019s for the baby to develop skills.", "NTA. Those moms weren\u2019t threatened, just nosy", "NTA. Everything you said was true. The instructor and the mothers there practice misandry. You set them straight. You shouldn't have any more problems.", "NTA \n\nAs someone who had a stay at home dad growing up, and a working mom- this treatment towards dads is sadly super common. You were totally in the right to call the instructor out, she was being incredibly bias, and so were the other women. \n\nI hope you can find a nicer baby gym!", "NTA. Those ladies may be the stay at home moms who don't understand any other world that traditional old world gender roles. I would also be furious and not want to waste my time or money with those people. The program, is not like any professional gym class. It is more like \"play time for mommies\" to make money for other stay at home mommies to run a business, that the rich Husbands or father has shelled out the franchise money to set up to give her something fun to do that she can con people into paying her a monthly subscription for basically play dates.", "NTA AT ALL.\n\nOmg not at all. And that is a wildly bizarre leap for your mom to make.\n\nThis is sexism plain as day. No one asked the other women in the group where their husbands were.\n\nYou handled it perfectly, as did your wife.\n\nYou should withdraw from the program, find another, and leave a negative review of the first. \n\nI\u2019m appalled for you, and that the instructor would say that. It\u2019s egregious.", "I just took my baby to Gymboree and the instructor was a very nice man. Those women are idiots NTA", "Wow, that was really disgusting from the instructor. Those women need to drop the old, tired gender norms and roles, and your mother should probably have a talk about it as well.\n\nNTA at all.\n\n(edit: fixed a phrase)", "oh ffs... NTA and good riddance", "I've been a single mum basically from the start (left my marriage due to domestic violence when my eldest was 1 and I was pregnant) and my kids father has never really been involved. \n\nI LOVED having dads/uncles/grandfathers in baby/child/parent groups/sessions because it allowed my children to see healthy male role models, and have healthy interactions with men (my dad died at 43yo). \n\nMy kids are now 13 and 15 and I still actively seek out male therapists (both have autism so see OT, speech etc), and teachers where possible/appropriate so they can learn how to have safe relationships and interactions with men (I am single and due to their additional needs/appointments and work, I rarely date or get to meet new people). Keep being a great dad and husband and ignore the small minded people who have anything negative to say.", "NTA! What if you were a same sex couple? How very dare them comment on it all. My husband would have turned it back on them and asked why the daddies don\u2019t ever show up? Surely they can take one day off from KFC to be there for there kid?", "100% NTA they were rude. Very rude.", "Also, like... this class isn't taking place in the middle of the woods at night. Nor is it so massive that it's easy to lose track of each other.

Stealing one of their babies right out from under their noses... in an extremely public setting... while closely surrounded by other parents and instructors... in broad daylight? \n\nI could understand if OP was showing up to these classes without his baby, because that would indeed be bizarre and unnerving.
