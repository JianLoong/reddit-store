I started dating a man who was 21 years older than me and I ended up pregnant very early into our relationship. I will call this man Kevin (now 50M). I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, Adam 6M, and Kevin and I split when I was 25 due to issues mainly caused by Kevin. It was clear we wanted different things in life and he was constantly paranoid that I would get with someone closer to me own age and thus became controlling.

I don't regret our relationship because I got our beautiful little boy out it and I don't consider myself to have been taken advantage of. \n\n\nKevin suffered a heart attack a few days ago and had a surgery to remove the clot. Kevin's older children (all daughters) all live out of state/far away and my son and I are the only people he has close by, so I stayed with him in hospital and called his daughters to fly in to visit. \n\nNow, Kevin's doctor's recommended that he stays with a family member for the next month to be safe as he lives alone. Although I'm not technically 'family' to him, I am his son's mother so Kevin's daughters have expected me to let him live with me so they can return home to their family's and jobs. I told them that I had stayed with him in hospital day and night until they arrived and they couldn't expect me to give up my time to care for him now, especially given how tumultuous my relationship with him was. They're insisting that now since we get along better, I should 'do it for my son' and take Kevin in because my son will feel horrible in the future knowing his mother refused to care for his father when he was ill. \n\nThey called me the AH for refusing because now one of them will be forced to take time off work and come stay with him in my city, when I live only 20 minutes away from him and could easily look after him. I'm starting to feel like that I am being the AH because this is clearly a difficult situation for everyone involved and I'm refusing to help out just because I don't want to live in the same house as Kevin again.
