The comments on here telling her how involved she should be and ordering her around are infantilizing and insulting. \n\nOP is NTA, but people need to stop talking her out of helping if she\u2019s comfortable helping at that level. \n\nThat\u2019s a decision for *her* to make and it wasn\u2019t the question she posed.", "His sisters actually adore him, he was the baby of the family growing up and he's still very close to them. I haven't spoken to them during this whole ordeal but his daughters have probably been in contact with their aunts. My guess is probably that no one has asked them to come look after him yet because they expected me to do it.\n\nEdit: They all also live quite far. Two are in Canada and one is in the same state as the eldest sister who's married with kids.", ">His sisters actually adore him\n\nProblem solved.

A friend learned this the hard way with her stepson.", "OP, NTA, and the hospital should be coming up with a discharge plan that does not include you. There are plenty of options.  I have sat in plenty of hospital discharge meetings with my parents. He will be fine. Even if he isn't, it is not your responsibility.

He needs someone full time and you are not obligated to be that person.

Otherwise they can go fish.", "Do not take that man in or care for him. It is damn near impossible to have a disabled person (temporarily or permanently disabled) removed from a house once they have a history of habitation.

He's not your job to care for but theirs. They can hire carers if they don't want to stay.", "Nta he is your ex. He can go stay in a nursing home to recover if he has nobody else.

When they balk at that idea and tell you that isn't her responsibility and that she isn't in a relationship with him anymore, you can throw back, \"Aren't you ashamed of her for not taking care of your father\".

I'm sorry,  but I can only tolerate Kevin in a non-cohabotation co-parenting relationship, and I think it's very inappropriate of you to try and since him on me just because we share a child. I have work obligations, and won't be able to care for him and sicc him on me and our son. You all have husband's to help you. I don't.  So, no. I won't be taking responsibility for him.

Like come on No is a full sentence. He has family and it's their responsibility to figure it out and you are not the solution.
