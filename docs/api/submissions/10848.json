We set her up with a place to live with a friend, we let her borrow our van, and got her a cellphone. And for the last 10 months she didn't look for work or help with rent/bills, which led our friend to move out into a place he could afford on his own. About 3 weeks ago she got a job, and said the apartment would be ready in 2 weeks, she planned on staying in a hotel in the interim. She called me on Friday and asked if she could come hang out on Saturday, no prob. Then she asked if her and the kids could stay the night, her pets (dog and 2 boy cats) are fine in the van, alright. I'll reschedule my birthday plans. Sunday she says she's signing the papers for the apt on Monday, so just one more night, fine. Monday night she came back and said she put in the application at the apt, she's sure she'll be approved by Friday. At this point I'm pretty annoyed, I spend Tuesday afternoon (my birthday) venting to my husband, and my sister sends me a text that her cat had kittens in my van. She assures me that she told me about the female feral cat she took in, she didn't. So Tuesday night into Wednesday morning she goes out to the van a dozen+ times to heat it up for the cats. My dogs bark at the door all night. When we get up in the morning to get our kids to school, we find that my sister's kids are still there, and she's not. I have an appointment in 30 minutes to tour a facility for my grandmother, and after that my husband had  plans for my birthday. So I called my sister, found out that she'd gone to work. I told her she can't just leave her kids here, that they're supposed to be in school, her oldest has autism and isn't self sufficient, so I can't just leave them, and I told her she needs to leave work and come get them now. She said it isn't her fault, the car was out of gas when she got up, so she couldn't take them. She said she thought I could just take them when I got up (I don't even know what schools they go to!). I reminded her that I had an appointment and birthday plans, and that what she was doing was unacceptable. She said she didn't know that her staying with us was such a burden, and I assured her that wasn't the problem and that my issue was her taking advantage of me. So her response was to call me selfish (along with some stronger words), say this was \"only a small favor\" and I \"couldn't just help her out this once\". She came back, told me not to worry, that she'll never ask for my help ever again and her and the kids will just sleep in the van in the cold, then \"enjoy your day princess\", and left. My husband went to the appointment and I cried all day. I feel awful, I know boundaries are important,  plus we have 4 other siblings in town she could probably stay with, but my heart hurts. Was I wrong to make my stand here, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677298010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bbis1/aita_for_making_my_sister_leave_work_to_pick_up/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She could have easily gotten everyone up early for one day, gotten herself up early enough to grab gas before getting her kids up, or even just gone for gas any of the times she turned on the van for warmth and saw the empty tank! \n12) she absolutely knows she\u2019s being a burden and doesn\u2019t care. \n13) The freeloader who got her move and 10 mos of bills paid for along with room and board for herself and her kids and a phone and van is calling YOU selfish?? \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39 I just can\u2019t!\n14) a small favor is asking in advance can you watch my kids while i do this job interview, can you help me move into my new apartment now that we\u2019re in town, hey I\u2019m really in a bind can you cover x bill this month so my kids have power and I\u2019ll pay it back on my first paycheck\u2026..

It is a massive imposition that very few people would even be able to afford to provide never mind willing! \n15) does she promise?? \n16) they won\u2019t take help anymore\u2026 just\u2026  sleep in the van that IS YOURS after insulting you?? Wow she\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t demand tue keys back out of sheer anger (not that it will be usable or sellable without a massive deep cleaning after 4 animals (one feral and not litter trained) + an unknown number of newborn kittens have been sleeping and birthing in it\u2026) \n\nYou are not only NTA you are a mf saint!!!", "NTA. It sounds like she is taking advantage of you and you need to set some boundaries. They are her kids and she needs to do a better job of looking after them.", "NTA and what she did was neglect her kids.  \nShe could have dropped them to their school at least, and how can she expect you to drop her kids off when you don't even know which school they go to?  \nShe is the AH and not you, at least she could have checked in with you or called a uber for her kids to drop off on the way to the office.", "NTA. You have patience I could only ever dream of. She would have kept taking and taking and taking from you if you\u2019d let her stay any longer.

She is taking advantage, and the only card she has left is guilt. Sleeping in a cold van is going to help this girl develop character. At worst, she'll have to come up with a different story and approach for your other siblings.", "NTA! Everything else aside, she neglected to fill the tank and failed to ask you for your help with the kids. You have patiently accommodated her. It's absolutely reasonable for you to expect your sister to make plans for her own kids. Even if you had been spouses with shared responsibility for the children, instead of one sibling doing a favor by letting her stay (...and stay, and stay...), it still would have been unreasonable for her to expect you to drop everything and look after the gas tank, the prep for school, and transportation to school, without talking about it and coordinating with you. \n\nSorry about the disappointment and pain you're feeling. It's normal to feel disappointment about your birthday plans, and anger about her actions, and pain about her meanness and rudeness and lack of respect or appreciation for you. You deserve acknowledgement for all of your love and kindness, and a great celebration for your birthday.", "NTA-good riddance, sister is still a child. \n\nOP you need to get yourself into therapy ASAP and discuss why you\u2019re such an enabler. Fix this about yourself now, before you become the enabler to your own kids. It\u2019s really important because otherwise, your kids could grow to be just like this sister. I suspect a parent was also an enabler and you learned that this is what you to to \u201cbe nice and take care of family\u201d. Guess what! It\u2019s not. You do NOT keep \u201cgiving\u201d to someone who is a \u201ctaker\u201d.  Your behavior toward your sister hasn\u2019t been nice or helped her until just now when you finally demanded you be treated respectfully, and forced her to stand on her own two feet.\n\nVery thankful that your sister has cut contact. Now keep it that way until you can get a stronger backbone.", "Obviously you're not an AH. I don't get your emotional reaction to your sister calling you names. Do you realize you're being a pushover and that your sister is oblivious and self-centered? \n\nYou should have reacted to her by saying that if that's how she feels, then that's her loss, and hasta la vista.", "NTA. If there was a problem with the car, the normal thing to do would be to ask you before leaving for work. That's not counting all the other things you've done for her.", "So, you're asking if you're an a-hole for making your sister leave work to pick up her kids from your house? Let me tell you something, my dude, that's like asking if you're an a-hole for putting ketchup on a hotdog. Of course not, it's just common sense!\n\nListen up, family is family, and they gotta help each other out, right? But your sister, she's taking advantage of your kindness.\n\nAnd what's up with her leaving her kids at your place like it's a free daycare center? That's like leaving a grizzly bear in a pet store, it just ain't right. And then she had the nerve to call you selfish?\n\nBut hey, at least you put your foot down and set some boundaries. So don't sweat it, my dude, just keep doing you and don't let your sister take advantage of your kindness again. Peace out!", "enough is enough. She needs to grow up and you need to cut her off.", "Call her bluff. She has a job, she has **four** other siblings she could stay with. She's failed to support herself in the first apartment you got her, adopted a feral cat that gave birth in your van, flat out lied about how long she'd be staying with you, glossed over the fact that she derailed your birthday, ditched her kids with you. She is going to freeload until she no longer can. If you reach out and apologize for anything the entire circus is going to move back in, but she'll paint it as doing it because she forgives you, rather than her continuing to ask for massive favor after massive favor. \n\nShe's made it very clear that she's happy freeloading and doesn't have any qualms about taking advantage of you, this literally will not stop unless your stop it. You've been beyond accommodating, and all it's gotten you is another sabotaged birthday celebration and a new norm that she can abandon her kids and it's somehow your fault", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can\u2019t help someone that won\u2019t help themselves. She was able to get to work but couldn\u2019t manage to get her kids to school?? She\u2019s not making good decisions or being a good mom right now. Stop enabling her.", "NTA your sister sounds like a walking bad decision and there will be no end to it. It was a mistake to bring her there but that's over and done with. I'd stop helping her, she doesn't seem to appreciate it and she's just blaming everyone for her stupidity", "Sorry to say, but you need to cut the cord OP. Perhaps you haven't because you felt it would be disloyal. But by enabling her, she doesn't see the need to pick herself up and start acting like the adult her children need. Rather have her hate you and let it be the catalyst to step. up than keep carrying her until you both collapse. Because it's not like she can't make a change. She won't. And she is not seeing the consequences of her shitty decision because you are helicopter sistering. If you care about her, then you know she isn't living in a way that's sustainable. She is a mess. Anf if she doesn't shape up immediately, you should be very few worried for your niece and nephew. NTA, but you're skating on thin ice.", "Exactly correct, OP!! It totally makes sense. But you said it yourself, she only came back into your life-when-she-needed-you. Good luck to you! \n\nYes, tough love is needed sometimes. I have a rule for myself on comments-I only relegate to the harsh/tough love stance when the poster already was doing the right thing, but feeling awkward/guilty about it.", "Good that your kids are happy, but even if they don't know the details of things, you still are being pulled away from them to help manage your sisters life. With her gone, you will be able to focus on them more, you will have more money and time to spend on them. And if you allow yourself, you will be happier with her gone, even though it might hurt a bit to know your sister struggles. \n\nBeing the responsible one in the family can get tiring. It's ok to say no to others needs when they start to drain you. Those people will most likely call you selfish when you start telling them no, but if that was true, they never would have asked in the first place. You and your husband need to start letting your families figure out their own issues, otherwise why would they ever have to grow up, if they know you will always solve their problems?\n\nGood luck, and remember to be happy.", "Call CPS and get them involved for the safety of her children. Call for resources for homeless women & children in your area if you can\u2019t provide housing any longer & share it with your sister.  Find a no kill shelter & turn over the cats & kittens. If she can\u2019t afford housing she can\u2019t afford vet care for them. ESH for the lack of honest communication except the children.", "NTA. She's a user.", "Tell her the van is not an option, since it belongs to you. She needs to find an other place to sleep.", "Paragraphs.  YTA.", "So\u2026.is the van still in your name and if so is she on the insurance? If not, it may be illegal for her to be driving it or you could be stuck with the cost (in full) of any accident or incident.\n\nStill NTA", "NTA and now you know why you have to learn to say 'No.'  With practice, yu will be able to say it more often.  Your sister sounds extremely entitled and ungrateful.  When she calls you again, just go NC and hang up.  She doesn't deserve a place in your life.", "NTA--Time to dump her on another sibling, one that DIDN'T help move her and get her on her feet!", " \nShe is not making good decisions or being a good mother right now. Stop enabling him.", "The van / cat birthing suite\u2026"]}
