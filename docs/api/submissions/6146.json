This includes his opinions about women, the LGBTQ+ communication and more. Despite this, I try to keep quiet even when I don't agree with things he says or he makes me upset because I am the minor and he is the adult, so of course I have no opinion. Why would I?\n\nAnyways, let's get to the point. Every morning when I am at his house, he takes me to school. The morning of these events, it was a Monday, so of course I was extra tired and not ready to go back to school. I am NOT a morning person, everybody close to me knows that, especially my mom and dad.. so I was super quiet when we got in the car and he thought I was ignoring him. I was in fact NOT ignoring him, I acknowledged everything he said, I just didn't speak words. It was a lot of \"yes\" and \"no\" and \"mhm\" which he didn't like. \n\nBasically I told him I wasn't ignoring him but it was 7 in the morning and I was exhausted and didn't feel like talking - my tone was calm, not raising my voice or trying to be disrespectful AT ALL. He then responded \"that's fine, I'll just shut the fuck up then since you clearly don't care about anything I have to say.\" \n\nI was thinking \"please do\" but of course I just said nothing and kept quiet the rest of the ride. Despite this, I still said goodbye to him when I got out of the car to which he didn't respond and just waved at me in the most rude way you could possibly wave to somebody.\n\nSo whatever, the day moves on and I'm actually in a good mood. I had drama club rehearsal for our play after school, so I called him to pick me up when we were done and was feeling pretty good. When he picked me up he STILL seemed mad at me as if the whole day hadn't passed. Like seriously MOVE ON DUDE. But anyways, I acted normal and said hi and told him about what happened at rehearsal until I realized he clearly didn't care and wasn't responding because of what had happened that morning. I finally just asked him if he would take me to my mom's house so I could pick something up. \n\nThis really set him off, let me tell you. He started going off on me saying I only talk to him when I need something and I don't care about him or love him and all of this stuff which might I add is not out of the norm for him to say. I think in this moment I got so sick of dealing with him being immature so I finally got up the courage to say \"That isn't true and you know it. Why don't you grow up and start acting like an adult for once?\" \n\nHe kinda just went quiet and ignored me the rest of the night. I guess I might be TA because he is my dad and that was in general a rude thing to say, but I think I just got sick of him projecting his insecurities on to me and acting super immature as a 46 year old man and my father. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672518791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1002zsf/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_grow_up_and_start/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This reads more accurately if the roles are swapped and your dad is 16 and you\u2019re 46.  He was acting like a hormonal teenager, and therefore, being an adult father\u2026 needed to grow up.  NTA.", "The way your dad acted is *not* okay. \n\nThere is absolutely no situation in which swearing at your kid, stonewalling them and then emotionally blackmailing them is remotely acceptable. \n\nOP, I would seriously suggest having a chat with an adult you trust about how you feel. The fact that you even feel the need to justify your reasons for not wanting to chat with him is worrying in itself - we all have \u2018those mornings\u2019 and usually people just let us be quiet. You don\u2019t need a reason or an excuse to not feel like talking, and your request to drop by your mom\u2019s house to pick something up is in no way unreasonable. \n\nYou are most certainly NTA.", "NTA you sound like a very mature 16 year old. Was it rude?  Maybe.  Was he rude?  Yes.    It is okay to not want to be chatty first thing in the morning. Your dad lashing out like that over something so minor seems way out of proportion to me.", "NTA. Your dad is 46 years old and doesn\u2019t know how to properly communicate and/or act. 16 year olds can say some pretty nasty stuff to their parents while going through puberty, high school, etc - which isn\u2019t right, but it happens and parents forgive them and move on because that\u2019s what a parent does. Love you unconditionally. And you didn\u2019t even say anything rude\u2026 I applaud you for being mature and direct. I hope this is a wake up call to him.", "NTA you were direct and put the blame where it belongs: in his court. And remind him that you\u2019re not a morning person, especially when he tries to chat in the morning \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. He was being childish and this has been building up for some time.", "NTA anyone who can\u2019t understand that you are tired and are not in the mood for a conversation is the person who has the problem. You tried to explain and he knows your morning routine and lack of energy and , shall we say, enthusiasm.  He is the one who made an issue over something that was never an issue to begin with. He\u2019s the one who created the issue with his assumptions and skewed perceptions. It\u2019s not on you.  He is also the only person who can choose to let it upset him or not. He chose to hold on to his negative emotions all day. That\u2019s also on him. You hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.  \n\nAs for finally blowing up, that is not your fault either, that was a long time coming reaction from his behavior and unfair treatment to you. Just because your only 16 doesn\u2019t mean you are not allowed to have an opinion or that you aren\u2019t capable of making your own decisions on things that he may or may not agree with. Furthermore, when he makes up such accusations that aren\u2019t true on a regular basis, it would wear anyone down. Those behaviors of manipulation and false accusations is emotional abuse. You have every right to tell him to stop treating you that way. \n\nMaybe it was worded a bit harshly, but if that\u2019s how he treats you, and you don\u2019t like it, you have every right to tell him to stop.", "NTA. As the mom of a 16 year old son, your dad is acting like a kid and does need to grow up. He\u2019s being manipulative too, which is also highly annoying. If my son speaks to me in a tone that isn\u2019t great, I point it out and have him be aware that he\u2019s being rude, not lose my shit and throw a tantrum because he doesn\u2019t feel like talking. Nor do I claim he doesn\u2019t love me or some crap. You and him are teens, but you\u2019re also people who are allowed to have times where you\u2019re tired, or upset, or just don\u2019t feel like talking like adults do. And you\u2019re allowed to have feelings, thoughts, emotions, and even opinions despite being a minor. How you express them is important (don\u2019t be rude) but you\u2019re still allowed to express them. \n\nI wonder if you hit a nerve with him. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll change, but fingers crossed.", "INFO: are your parents divorced and if so, how many days do you see/stay with your dad?", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nKids do not owe their parents (anything) a positive attitude, happy cheerful, peppy conversations. Everyone has moments they don\u2019t feel like talking or have other things on their mind. It\u2019s not like you could pick to be away from him or sit in your room. You don\u2019t owe him company. \n\n\nI get sick in morning really easy. When people used to give me attitude about not being cheerful I would just tell them I will throw up on them. I\u2019m not saying this is how you should handle it.. but it did work most times lol", "NTA, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s actually really impressive how well you handled the situation considering you\u2019re only 16. You stayed calm and respectful, but also had enough self respect to stand up for yourself.\n\nYour dad sounds exhausting, so just do what you gotta do to maintain good mental health.", "NTA.  Your parents already know you are not a morning person, and you were responding to him, just not in the way he thought you should.  He was being very childish and immature with his response. Not everyone likes to chat non-stop in the mornings.  My mom and I are both like that.  Don't even think of having a long chat with us before 9 am and our first cup of coffee.  Lol", "NTA, as long as you are prepared for the consequences. His childishness will dictate that he take it out on you.", "NTA. It's so stupid of him to be butthurt over the fact that you were tired in the morning and didn't say much. And the fact that he, as a grown man, ignored you because he was pissed off about that. He was acting like a child, he's a 46 year old man. You would think that he would know better by now.", "Hmm. NAH I think. Dad was rude but so were you so it sounds like you two mostly just have some communication issues you have to work through.", "I hope people don't think I'm being hostile in these replies, it's not my intention, however.. this topic is kind of sensitive and it honestly offends me that people are defending my dad \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d but I do remind myself that they don't truly understand off of this one post that is explaining how he often acts so that's okay <3", "ESH but the yta part is soooooft and here's why.\n\nThis is probably an age thing that comes with more life experience so it's probably going to be difficult to see it from a conversation partner's perspective but I feel like just because we are tired and not feeling all too personable isn't a reason not to be polite to people.\n\nI have delayed sleep phases due to ASD which makes me really grumpy in the mornings when I have to go to work, but I still try to be as friendly as I can with colleagues etc in the morning because I have learned it is just polite to acknowledge people or you can make them feel like that have done something to offend you. I feel like that extends to family too because we shouldn't treat them differently just because we live with them. \n\nWith a sibling who often responds in a monosyllabic manner like you described because she is tired it can come across as really rude and disinterested which isn't a nice feeling if you're trying to be friendly or ask someone about their day etc. I know we have a right to be tired and think of ourselves sometimes and I'm sure my sister doesn't realise she is doing it but because she does it a /lot/ it can actually make you feel really small when someone responds to you like that, so I can see why your dad might have got a little upset. From his perspective I imagine he is just trying to bond with you and is hitting a bit of a brick wall with it when you are tired which doesn't feel nice.\n\nOf course the way your dad reacted was very immature and to continue to take that out on you hours later is just ridiculous, hence the esh judgement.", "ESH.\n\nYou both suck at communicating, but to be fair to you, you\u2019re still young and you learned your communication style from your parents, so that\u2019s kinda on your dad too. But instead of being rude when your dad was trying to talk to you that morning, you could have said \u201chey dad, I\u2019m really tired and not feeling up to a conversation this morning, would you mind if we just had a quiet car ride to school today?\u201d\n\nMaybe he would have taken issue with that too, but at least you would have the moral high ground as you would have communicated your feelings/needs rather than being rude. \n\nYour dad could have better communicated that he was upset with the way you were speaking to him, and why it bothers him, and definitely should not have blown up over this. \n\nAlso, not being a \u201cmorning person\u201d is not an excuse to be rude to people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You also say you aren\u2019t a morning person and your were tired/not in the mood to chat that day. So while you \u201ctechnically\u201d may not have been ignoring him, when you combine all of the factors at play during that car ride, isn\u2019t it possible that maybe, just maybe, the way you were responding to your dad that day and the energy you were giving off could be perceived as rudeness? \n\nAnd you don\u2019t get to tell someone else when they should be over your rudeness. You feel like he should have been over it by the time he picked you up from school. He wasn\u2019t. His response was OD, and he sucks for that, no question, but as I and others have tried to point out, you aren\u2019t all the way in the clear here either.\n\nI mean look, if you just want to dig in and claim you did nothing wrong that day, best of luck to you.

And the two of you live together 50% of the time. Once you realize your dad is not some magical person with special powers or knowledge on how to navigate the world, I think it will help you out a ton. He\u2019s just a dude who had a kid 16 years ago and is trying to figure everything out- just like all of us. I didn\u2019t figure that out about my parents until I had kids of my own.
