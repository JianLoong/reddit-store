This year I proposed to her and am super excited to get married.\n\nShe comes from a christian household, and for years there has been a rule at her parents house that all unmarried couples can't sleep in the same room. This rule has driven division between her parents and us so for the last 6 years. In the past we would either comply with their rules to avoid drama, or we would get a hotel instead of staying at the house. It's about 4 hours from our current location so going home at the end of the night usually isn't an option.\n\nFast forward to now, we asked if we could stay and they still wanted us to sleep separately. My fiance and I felt as if they were being unreasonable since we are in the process of getting married, and felt uncomfortable going to their house for the holidays. Just having my fiance at the end of the night there is a great way to us we to socially decompress after interactions with extended family. Usually we'd comply, but the straw finally broke the camel's back after years of abiding by their rules. We thought it was best to politely decline to attend.\n\nMy fiance gets several texts from her mother about how her decision is causing her mom and dad to cry uncontrollably, and voiced little remorse when we said that our relationship feels  invalidated when they impose their will upon us. Her mom bases her rationale by using the bible, and there isn't anything that would change her mind about the topic.\n\nWhat concerns me most is that we won't have a traditional church wedding, so I'm starting to wonder if her mother will accept that we are truly \"married\" without having a pastors \"blessing\". This may cause the control issue to persist years into our marriage, so I think it's best to address this issue ASAP.\n\nSo reddit, AWTA for declining the holidays with her parents because we are uncomfortable with their rules?", "created_utc": 1669173731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2dxg8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sleep_in_separate_rooms/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to live with this other person presumably for a long time.  You only have to interact with the extended families at special occasions if you want.  It's a wildly different dynamic.

That's how the relationship has worked up till now, so she's pushing back and so they have to push harder to get what they want out of her. \n\nHonestly this just sounds like you and your fiance should be going to counseling before you get married just to ensure that you both are absolutely on the same page about what you both want, and whether or not you guys should have any contact with her parents", "NTA - you are well within your right to decline an invitation, and also well within your right to set boundaries about how you and partner are to be treated.

They categorize sins in a convoluted hierarchy and then decide if they are aware of the sin and don\u2019t control if into stopping then it\u2019s not fair because THEY have to follow the rules, so why shouldn\u2019t you. \n\nNTA", "Especially since the couple has been together for years and lived together.", "You don't have to see these people, who have little respect or tolerance for you, every holiday. You are forming your own family now. That first Christmas alone with your own tree or Thanksgiving laughing with friends, and you will realize how nice it is to NOT spend every holiday with them. BTW..XMas may not be the time to discuss that your not having a church wedding. INFORM them of what YOUR doing (don't allow them to control with $). Keep to your beliefs bc this is your life. Stay strong through the drama and set this early boundary.", "That's what I get for not reading the whole thing. I'm such and AH. Agreed, not participating is good move.", "Yeah, the second someone tells you you made them cry \"all day long\" because you'd rather stay in a hotel than sleep on an air mattress in the basement so they can pretend their child is still a virgin, you can pretty much do your worst, in my opinion.\n\nCry harder, MIL.", "no, imo you are not repsonsible for their reaction. they can make rules, however backwards they may be, but cant complain if you dont like them and not come around. they cant force you to do something you are uncomfortable with. them saying that you guys are ruining the relationship and text that they are crying is absolutely manipulative. honestly, i wouldnt want to be around such people anyways, they seem toxic as fuck.\n\nyou are adults, you lead your own life however you want.", "No, I read it all... but the basic question (slightly restated) was\"AITA for not wanting to follow the rules my Fiance's parents have in place for their house?\"\n\nIf the parents are pissed because they want to respect the rule and sleep elsewhere, then the parents would be TAH.\n\nAnd I love how people think these rules are \"bs\" rules just because they don't agree with rules that are obviously based on classic religious beliefs.", "No, I read just fine.\n\nThe question was asked (paraphrased)  \n\"AITA for not wanting to follow the house rules of my future in-laws\".  \nThat was followed by continuing to ask the parents to allow them to break the rules.\n\nNow if the question has been  \n\"AITA for not wanting to stay at my future in-laws house because I don't like their house rules?\"  \nTHEN I would vote NTA\n\nBut OP did NOT ask that question.", "Thissss", "THIS.", "I have a few religious friends who are cool and they always say all these Christian\u2019s who do this are doing the opposite of wwjd. Cuz it\u2019s not for them to judge at all. Their job is to be kind and let god deal with it.", "Not wanting to do something and removing yourself from the situation. \n\nGoing with the intent to ignore the rules because you don\u2019t want to. \n\nDo you see a difference?", "Yes. Unfortunately, the \u201cgood ones\u201d are few and far between lately.", "Yeah I\u2019m not religious at all cuz I grew up In between Catholic Church and Methodist church. But I appreciate my friend who doesnt push it on others we respect eachother and they aren\u2019t racist or homophonic. Is def rare."]}
