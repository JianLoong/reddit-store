I like to think I am a pretty open and accommodating employer and try to be respectful of all of my employees and their lives. Every year my wife and I host a holiday party that includes a catered meal and dessert. From the very beginning, it has always been presented as a holiday party that doesn't favor one culture or specific holiday over another since we've always had employees from various cultures and religions and most have a major holiday in either December or January. It's meant to just be a celebration with everyone to have a good time at the end of the year. \n\nWe held our holiday party this weekend and after announcing that dinner was going to be served in a few minutes and for everyone to make their way to the tables, one of our new employees and some of our older employees came to ask us if I would say grace or would let one of them say grace before the meal. I was pretty surprised at this request especially coming from employees that have been with us for years and they know we have never had a prayer before eating in the past so I wasn't sure why they would suddenly ask now. I told them no and some of them said it was important to them and their families to always say grace before a meal. I asked what spurred this sudden request and they told me they had been talking about how they found it weird that my wife and I go to church but have never said grace at these parties or any of our potlucks. I told them that is because our private life is our private life and does not belong mixing with our professional life, and that they were free to hold a prayer circle outside of the dining room with their families or do it quietly at the tables by themselves. \n\nI thought that was the end of that but when I arrived at work this morning all five that asked on Saturday handed in their two-week notice citing that they didn't feel comfortable working for me anymore, one of them has worked for me for the last 9 years. I understand it may not have been what they wanted to hear but I was trying to look out for all of the employees. My wife is trying to get them to stay on board. AITA for not letting them say grace aloud with everyone at dinner?", "created_utc": 1671477503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq0r1q/aita_for_not_allowing_some_of_my_employees_to_say/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did actually try to accommodate their requests by allowing them to hold a prayer circle outside of the establishment. Not everyone follows their religion, and you clearly understand that it would not be fair to make employees that have different beliefs or a different culture to be forced to join in on saying grace to a god they may not believe in.\n\nThe problem with these people is that they are trying to shove their religion down other people\u2019s throats. From questioning you as to why you don\u2019t say grace at company parties to trying to convince you to let them loudly and proudly force everyone to wait to eat before they say their prayers is absolutely inconsiderate behavior, and you did the right thing by explaining to them that you don\u2019t want to mix professional life with your religious beliefs. No one else should be subjected to that either.\n\nI would tell your wife politely to just stop trying to keep them on board. She is clearly a lovely person and means well, and you and your wife sound like very caring and considerate people, and you treat your employees fairly, but I would say it\u2019s a *godsend* that they quit so you don\u2019t have to put up with this any longer.\n\nFor the five that quit, you have 45 other employees who are still with you and any of them who don\u2019t share those beliefs in your workplace will be thankful to you for it. You can easily find five more to replace what you lost because I can assure you that *you haven\u2019t lost anything*.\n\nGood riddance to **The Five Bigots**. May they stick together for the holidays like the \u201c*Three Musketeers*\u201d and find another employer who will put up with their bullshit.\n\n**NTA.**", "NTA. This is a work environment and you gave them the option of praying amongst themselves and they turned that down (oddly). So what exactly was their issue? You accommodated their request while still being respecting of your other employees.", "NTA I am a Christian but this is uncool. Prayer doesn\u2019t need to be showy. They can pray silently to themselves before they eat or they can pray outside the meal like you suggested. Blessing the food before eating would not be inclusive. You\u2019re a good boss in this regard, sir.", "NTA. People can say a prayer privately before eating. No need to involve anybody.", "NTA. Work isn't the place for enforced religious observance - you likely have employees who are not Christian, and would likely feel uncomfortable being compelled to say grace. You made a reasonable suggestion - that your Christian employees do their own prayer circle or do it quietly at the table privately. Your employees are being unreasonable, and I wonder if they've gone down some YouTube rabbit hole of sorts.", "NTA. \n\nNot everyone is Christian, or a believer in anything at all. You absolutely did the right thing. \n\nI know several people who are deeply religious and always say a prayer before a meal, but when they're dining with people who do not share their faith, they either say the prayer silently or slip off quickly before the meal. THAT is how you do it. \n\nIt feels largely very performative, and I can't help but wonder if that new employee is the instigator. It's regrettable that they've all decided to make themselves unemployed over this, but ultimately it's their decision to make. Caving in and admitting wrongdoing to try to get them to stay would set a number of unfortunate precedents for your other employees moving forward - resist this urge.", "NTA\n\nThey could have had a quiet moment of prayer on their own.\n\nIf you had suddenly sprung a public prayer on the entire group there's a good chance that you would have offended or alienated others in the room.\n\nIt sucks to have them all put in their notice over this, but you can find other workers. Their religious preferences do not supercede other people's and quitting a job over this is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou may never find this out directly from them, but your non-Christian employees appreciate this stance more than you realize. Even as an adult, there is immense pressure to participate in Christian rituals at school and work. Usually people can accept if someone follows another Western religion (though not always), but people tend to get offended if you tell them you're an atheist, so it's often easier to just go along, but it's very uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nIt's unusual they have all handed their notice in.  I wonder if someone has been stirring the pot.\n\nYou weren't rude and you had no issues in them saying their own private grace.  The thing is that by insisting they say grace that it might upset others who don't want to say grace.  So it was lose lose for them (and you).\n\nPerhaps it's best that you let them go and wish them the best in the future.\n\nYou're allow to have your religious convictions but it's not considered great to foist them on everyone else.  And that applies to all religions.  They probably can't see the irony if someone from another culture wanted to do something religious and insisted that everyone else do the same in the workplace when they will see it as wrong and against their religion.  You can't argue with that as it's irrational thoughts.", "NTA. It's really awkward for the non-Christian coworkers when someone tries to inject a very Christian grace at public events. Privately, sure, go for it, but you are right, in the professional setting it's better to be religion-neutral.", "Absolutely NTA. You said they were more than welcome to say grace privately and gave them options but they declined and chose to quit since they weren't allowed to force their beliefs and practices on everyone. Good riddance.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd they're absolutely full of crap about you \"not accommodating their religious practices\". You told them - and appropriately so - that they were welcome to say grace quietly to themselves over their own meals, which was the ONLY appropriate response at a workplace get-together where there were people of other religions. You did not keep them from blessing their own meals . . . you kept them from pushing their religion on others. \n\nWhat they were asking was incredibly inappropriate. It is not a \"religious accommodation\" to request to be allowed to PRAY EN MASSE OVER A GROUP MEAL, in a way that presents as being \"official\" and part of the festivities, when it is a workplace occasion and there are people of other faiths participating. As a Jewish person this would have made me INCREDIBLY uncomfortable, and I would have felt deeply unwelcome at best . . . and likely a lot worse, given the historical issues around Christianity and oppressive violence against my people at the holidays. My closest friends, to be clear, are mostly Catholics . . . but they would NEVER subject me to having them pray over my meals, or around me at all. \n\nYou are NTA, but they are huge ones, and you are well rid of them and should let them go. Frankly, if you had allowed their nonsense your other employees would have had cause for a lawsuit.", "Definitely NTA. You gave them other options to fulfill their request. Did any of them stop to think if their prayer would have offended others at the table because I doubt it.", "NTA\nI feel like the if you've given them the option to say is in silence and they refused - you've done your part.\nHow would they feel if someone from another religion would pray aloud in front of everyone in that holiday party?", "NTA\n\nyou were so mindful of your other employees and their families there who may not share/practice the same faith as the smaller group of employees. Its not that you didnt want them to say grace in your home, you just didnt wana force it down everyones throat. You offered alternatives like doing it in another room or quietly at the table and the fact that those options werent good enough may mean that they felt that everyone in the room needed to witness their faith at the holiday party. To me, if it were about saying grace and givinig thanks, wouldnt doing it in another room be a good enough option?", "NTA. They can pray in private but they don\u2019t have the right to push that on others anywhere, especially not a work function.", "NTA at all and you did the correct thing. Reach out to a lawyer for advice on the situation. I suspect there maybe ulterior motives here, I\u2019m not sure where you live but I\u2019m in the US and you don\u2019t just leave a job like that. Be on the safe side and protect yourself.", "NTA. They were welcome to say grace privately. You did the right thing by not forcing their religion and traditions on everyone else. If you had made everyone participate, you likely would've had a stack of resignation letters from others who felt uncomfortable being forced to pray at a work social event.", "NTA. You did the right thing in this situation \u2014 you did not stop them from practicing their own beliefs, only prevented them from foisting those beliefs on others. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to suggest they say grace outside the larger group or quietly at their own table. You were respectful to everyone in your company. Many agree with you that prayer and demonstration of religious beliefs are not appropriate in a professional setting. \n\nThey\u2019re free to quit if they believe so strongly that you should have put your personal religious beliefs on display. They don\u2019t get to decide that for you or your other employees.", "NTA\nThank you for being respectful of others. Not everyone is the praying type and that's perfectly okay. Not everyone has the same beliefs and that is okay also. What is not okay is forcing their own beliefs on everyone and then decide to quit because you told them no we are going to respect everyone and make this event comfortable for anyone.\n\nLet them quit. Yes it will suck because you have to hire and train new employees, because people you thought were loyal aren't, because no matter what you lose as a business owner.  But showing your remaining 45 employees that you respect them enough to not force others thoughts and beliefs on them at a company event is going to mean a lot.\n\nAlso I would put up a very professional memo about how this is a tolerant work place and that means company events whether mandatory training, optional team building, or any type of get together/celebration/end of year events will not be religious events. That individual or groups of employees are free to break from the larger group if needed to practice/maintain their own religious beliefs during the event but that you would not be forcing or asking anyone to do anything such as practicing a religion. That you realize you may lose a small group of good employees but the company being respectful of each individual employee is more important and you are committed to having that respect for all.\n\nI don't know if I am making sense. Sorry.", "As a Christian who prays before meals, NTA.\n\nThis is a strange request to bring to a workplace dinner. I would never expect to go to a meal and tell the host to say grace. That\u2019s the host\u2019s personal choice. I would say my silent prayer myself, because it\u2019s important to *me,* but I know it isn\u2019t important to others.", "NTA and good riddance.  Had you acceded to their request, you would have a crap load of potentially greater issues involving religious discrimination/harassment/hostile workplace from your other employees.", "NTA Work and religion should generally be kept separate. You gave them reasonable options that they denied.", "NTA...Good luck to them finding gainful employment in the new year. Your approach is the correct approach.  I hope everyone else had fun.", "NTA - Your now ex employees are though.  It is so incredibly entitled and rude for them to even request forcing everyone to be subjected to their pre meal prayer.  They are why I have such distain for organized religion. You gave them the option to pray among themselves which should have been enough. If I went to a work holiday function and was forced to listen to fake Christians proselytizing I might quit.", "NTA. Let them quit. You sound like a good employer. They could have prayed at their own tables, like you said. No reason to pray at work or work-related functions.", "NTA. Honestly, had you let them, you would potentially be making a lot more people uncomfortable. \n\nThey are upset that you wouldn\u2019t let them use your holiday party as an opportunity to push THEIR religious beliefs on others. \n\nYou are absolutely in the right.", "NTA You handled this perfectly. I imagine they felt like if they all gave notice you'd be forced to make the office a more- I'm assuming- Christian workplace.\n\nIf they feel they can't work there anymore, this is the best option for them. And yes, it's possible that one or two people have egged on the two group but they've made this decision and you need to let them make it.", "I would be SUPER annoyed if I went to a work party and was forced into praying to someone's fake guy in the sky. \n\nI have no issue with ppl having their religion at all, until they start pushing it on others. Not everyone believes the same thing and no one should be forced into it during work functions. \n\nWould they have been cool with everyone having to sit thru a Muslim prayer as well? Or anything from a religion that isn't theirs?? HIGHLY doubt it. \n\nReligion should never be forced onto anyone. Let them go, ppl like that are gross. NTA", "NTA\n\n It was a power move on their part. \n\nEverybody knows both religion and politics are a no go at a work. People can have their religious freedom, but it shouldn't be imposed on anyone else. \nYou clearly offered an alternative and they choose to make an issue.", "NTA. If someone wants to pray that\u2019s their own right. But saying grace is forcing their religion on to other people and that\u2019s not okay.", "NTA. They always had the option to say grace privately at the party - like at any social gathering. They are asking to impose their beliefs on a mixed group and that would be inappropriate and make others feel uncomfortable. As a non-believer, I\u2019ve been on the other side of this. When a group ends up saying grace and I\u2019m the one that no longer feels comfortable", "NTA, but what your employees are doing is extremely manipulative and disrespectful towards you, their fellow employees,and your business. It may be best if you let them leave because once you give an inch they are just going to push for more things to be done their way according to their interpretation of their religious beliefs.", "NTA. \n\nWho knows what stories they\u2019re telling about their decision to leave. I\u2019d consult a lawyer, and then I\u2019d send a communication to the entire company to explain what happened. That way, everyone can be reassured about your intentions, your support for people\u2019s personal religious belief and practice, and your commitment that no one will ever impose their personal beliefs/practice on the rest of the company.", "NTA.  I'm a religious person (an extremely religious person by Reddit standards), and unless you work for a church or another religious organization, public grace at a business event is out of place.  Even one person who feels uncomfortable or alienated is one person too many.\n\nYour compromise was tactful and appropriate.", "Definitely NTA. I think you handled this with grace and tact but you have some bigoted employees who just outed themselves with resignation letters.", "NTA.  Let them walk, probably saved you long term headache.  Lots of loonies out there that make religion a central part of every thing they do.", "NTA\n\nI could see if you all were at a church event and someone wanted to say grace.  We do it all the time at my CHURCH!!!  It's expected but I would never make that request at my job.  I normally get my food, sit down and say my grace privately and then eat.  \n\nIf they have never done this before, I would consult an attorney about it.", "NTA. I'm not religious and hate it when people invade my live with there religion. If my workplace would encourage that I would feel uncomfortable (but  wouldn't leave).\nIf you let them do this it will change the work environment.", "NTA. They could all say a private grace, there is no need for a public one.", "NTA, as a non-religious person, it would make me *really* uncomfortable to have to sit with my coworkers while they said grace. I think you did the right thing, you gave them the opportunity to do it away from those that didn\u2019t want to participate. Thank you for looking out for your other employees of varying faiths", "NTA, so hard NTA.\n\nYou're the furthest thing from the asshole in this circumstance. Those people were looking for permission to preach to a group, likely to your detriment all considered.\n\nYou did the right thing, but  like a lot of right things, it looks like there will be a cost associated with it, and on the other hand you now know a quality to these employees you were unaware of.", "NTA, they are.  Remind them there are non-Christains there.  Start looking to replace them", "NTA. They can take up your offer of a prayer elsewhere if it bothers them so much. And big respect for being inclusive of other believes (or lack of) and cultures.", "NTA - Thank you for protecting the people who aren\u2019t overzealously Christian who work for you. Unfortunately, you should lawyer up immediately and document this whole series of events. The kind of Christian who is so fragile as to quit over not being allowed to impose their religion on their fellow employees is absolutely the sort of Christian who will try to sue you.", "NTA. Seems like you had a perfectly reasonable compromise but they are basically pouting because they couldn't do what they wanted.", "NTA.  \n\n\nBut something else is going on here. Be prepared to hear from their lawyers. I think you were set up.", "NTA. They could still say grace to themselves.", "NTA. It sounds like those employees were fishing for a way to be made more important than the other staff because of their religion and when they didn't get that they went straight for the persecution complex.", "NTA.  You accommodated their beliefs by giving them to option of saying grace quietly at their table, which is likely what the law requires you to do.  You're being a respectful employer to employees of all faiths (or no faith) and if they want to leave over that, I say good riddance to them!", "NTA but if your company has a lawyer, talk to them now about the best way to document this situation.  They might try to sue, even though their case would be frivolous.  Document now what happened, and get statements from others as well who witnessed your conversations - especially anyone who witnessed you saying they were free to do their own prayer circle but just could not do one for the whole event.", "NTA. It kind of sounds like they were testing you and prepared to do this. Thank you for not inflicting those awful moments of prayer on everyone. If they were really concerned with praying instead of making a show, they would have happily done it quietly at the table and not made it an issue.", "NTA:  \"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full\"\n\nThese people could have prayed silently like their bible instructs them to.", "NTA\n\nAnd don't you dare beg them to come back\n\nThey are trying to use your religious beliefs to get you to treat all the non christians in the office differently than you treat them.\n\nReally think about the kind of people that would do that.\n\nThis is one of those situations where you tell them to not let the door hit them on the way out.\n\nYou were accommodating and made it clear you weren't stopping them from praying, but that wasn't enough because they don't want accommodation.\n\nThey want everyone to do what they want them to do...even if it tramples on their rights or their own beliefs\n\nMy advice?\n\nShow them the door and be honest if anyone ever asks for a recommendation.   You tell them they were good workers but got it in their head that their religious beliefs were more important than everyone else's and then they insulted you, the owner, by trying to use your own personal faith as a means to get what they wanted\n\nAll of these individuals will regret this decision.", "nta ... they could have said grace in private  or quietly at the table ....you dont see muslims pulling rugs out in the middle of the dining room for their prayer sessions and if you had allowed them to it would have been disrespectful in the to the people who dont follow those religions", "NTA. And as an atheist; Thank You! Group prayer (as that is what grace is) has always made me uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019d probably be the one looking for a job if my employer had done or allowed a grace at a company dinner. I would\u2019ve seriously started questioning my standing and future. I\u2019ve seen people get denied promotions based on lack of faith, so open promotion of religion would\u2019ve had me looking at the door.", "NTA I am someone who is religious but I am not Christian. If I had been at a holiday party where I was required to say grace I likely would have left and either quit on the spot or put my 2 weeks in depending on my financial position at the time. You respected that not all of your employees would be comfortable with saying grace. That's a good employer.", "NTA - You accommodated their request. They are unable to view the situation outside of their needs.  It appears the only way they would be 'comfortable' is to get their way. You support a diverse workforce and your decision supports everyone.  I applaud you for this. You also demonstrate there is a distinction between decisions made in private and work environments.  Frankly, it may be best that they pursue something else.  Best to you and your wife.", "NTA. But be careful legally", "NTA that would have been awkward af for the non-Christians of the office. You gave them option to still say it amongst themselves. It\u2019s weird they felt the whole office must be involved", "NTA. You were right to make sure people of all faiths felt included. I say this as a person who reads the bible and loves God.\n\nI always pray in my head in situations like this. \n\nMatthew 6:5-6 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.", "NTA. You handled the request respectfully and correctly.\n\n If you\u2019re in the US, don\u2019t be surprised if this turns political and you end up a feature on right wing news.\n\nPut an attorney on standby.", "NTA\nNothing stopping the for saying their prayer at their table. They just want to force their ghost worshiping on others and having a hissy fit like 2 year olds because they didn\u2019t get their way. You got to let the trash take itself out.", "NTA. You were set up. They wanted to make a statement and hoist a Christian flag on your annual holiday party. \n\nThey confronted you on being Christian but not alienating others; they were pressuring you to \"pick a side\". They were trying to manipulate you. \n\nYou were thinking as a good employer who wanted everyone comfortable, including them. So it didn't occur to you that you were being manipulated.\n\nThey had those resignations ready for when you didn't \"pick a side\" for Christianity. \n\nGet ready, they'll try to claim persecution.", "NTA. I agree you should look for an attorney in your area, but if you allowed the prayer you definitely could have been subject to a discrimination claim if someone took issue with it.", "NTA\n\n~~Info: Did they expect everyone at the dinner to take part in the prayer and to not eat until it had been said?~~\n\nEdit: Thank you for replying. In my experience, when people ask to do grace they expect people to stop what they are doing and how their heads, even if they aren't taking part, which is why I asked about the eating part. If it had been something like \"they wanted to have a grace where they were seated, no expectation that others would have to participate\" that would hit different.\n\nA strong NTA from me. You offered them reasonable accommodations that were respectful of them and everyone else. Sounds like you handled it well. Definitely echo the notion of CYA though and talk to an attorney. Some sort of dialogue too regarding diversity training may be good too, as someone else suggested.", "NTA You didn't prevent them from saying grace. They could have said their own grace silently before eating. I've been at lots of work and social events where some people quietly bowed their heads and did an internal grace before eating. It's no big deal.", "NTA - I would contact your lawyer and establish a paper trail covering yourself, because this could come back on you, even though it absolutely shouldn't. If your other employees are comfortable, it may help to have them provide testimony about this incident, or others, that back you up.", "NTA. A prayer at this event would have been a tacit approval of that religion by you and your company, and those who were not of that religion would have felt as though they were others. If they felt the need to say grace prior to eating, it would have been easy for them to lower their heads and offer their own grace.\n\nYou're better off without them as employees.\n\nFinally, my guess is that, if you're from the US, they were evangelical Christians who like to throw bible verses around. Pass this one on to them:\n\n\"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\" -Mathew 6:5-6", "Wait a minute. Let's be clear here.\n\nYour employees are allowed to pray before a meal, either silently or aloud. That's not what they were asking for. They were asking for you to impose their religion on everyone in the room.\n\nIf it's important to them to say grace before a meal, they are free to do so - either by themselves or with any consenting people they are sitting with, and that's fine. You're not stopping them from saying grace - you're just not having communal prayer for your whole company, who may have a range of different religious faiths or none.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nSo the united states are really a burning dumpster of manic indoctrinated weirdos. I see.", "NTA, so they get to say grace and everyone else is excluded? What about the other religious people with their own traditions before meal? I need to pray to an icon of Jesus and Mary, but I do that at home, not somewhere else I'm invited to. Honestly I say good riddance, they are all acting unprofessional and judgemental of you. I say it's time to replace them and turn the other way if they beg for their jobs back.", "NTA. You handled this perfectly, from legal, moral , and etiquette standpoints. You were respectful of all of your employees. No one should have to be involved in religious rituals in a secular work setting.  I wonder what on earth they thought they were going to accomplish. How disappointing that your long-term employees would put you in such a position!", "NTA. You made it an open party that anyone could attend. If someone found it important to say grace, there was nothing stopping them and you gave them their 2 options, go to a private location to say grace, or do it quietly by themselves.\n\nThey were choosing to make a big deal out of it. I see people quietly say grace, before meals, all the time.\n\nMy guess, is those people also claim to be Christian. The Bible, and Jesus, promote quiet prayer. \n\nhttps://www.openbible.info/topics/silent_prayer", "NTA - I am not religious and I would have felt uncomfortable if grace was said before the meal.  I\u2019d never complain if that\u2019s what people want to do, but I am never comfortable with it.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about prayer. It\u2019s about you not being \u201creligious\u201d enough for them. Good riddance.", "NTA!!! I have had to participate in forced Christian prayer more times than I could count and it infuriates me every single fucking time. It especially pisses me off at gatherings where people KNOW I or others around me are not Christian but they just don\u2019t care. I\u2019m in the minority, is their reasoning, so I can put up with a little prayer to FAWTHA GAWD in Jesus\u2019s Holy Name, Born of The Virgin Mary who is the only thing in the whole wide world standing between me and eternal damnation for my lack of faith and devotion to him.

I think you could have told them that they were welcome to pray over their meal, but discretely. If others of other faiths wished to do the same, they should also be welcome to do so.  The big thing here is to not force any one religion on those of other faiths, or those who choose not to practice a faith.  Freedom to practice as they see fit, without trying to force others to follow your practices or beliefs.  \n\nIf you explain that to those who resigned, you might save them.

I like to think I am a pretty open and accommodating employer and try to be respectful of all of my employees and their lives. Every year my wife and I host a holiday party that includes a catered meal and dessert. From the very beginning, it has always been presented as a holiday party that doesn't favor one culture or specific holiday over another since we've always had employees from various cultures and religions and most have a major holiday in either December or January. It's meant to just be a celebration with everyone to have a good time at the end of the year. \n\nWe held our holiday party this weekend and after announcing that dinner was going to be served in a few minutes and for everyone to make their way to the tables, one of our new employees and some of our older employees came to ask us if I would say grace or would let one of them say grace before the meal. I was pretty surprised at this request especially coming from employees that have been with us for years and they know we have never had a prayer before eating in the past so I wasn't sure why they would suddenly ask now. I told them no and some of them said it was important to them and their families to always say grace before a meal. I asked what spurred this sudden request and they told me they had been talking about how they found it weird that my wife and I go to church but have never said grace at these parties or any of our potlucks. I told them that is because our private life is our private life and does not belong mixing with our professional life, and that they were free to hold a prayer circle outside of the dining room with their families or do it quietly at the tables by themselves. \n\nI thought that was the end of that but when I arrived at work this morning all five that asked on Saturday handed in their two-week notice citing that they didn't feel comfortable working for me anymore, one of them has worked for me for the last 9 years. I understand it may not have been what they wanted to hear but I was trying to look out for all of the employees. My wife is trying to get them to stay on board. AITA for not letting them say grace aloud with everyone at dinner?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA you said it was a holiday party not specifically a Christmas party, and even then not everyone has the same religion. I wouldn't want to make anyone uncomfortable by forcing people to say grace to my God. These 5 employees all suck for choosing this hill to die on, especially when it's never been done before.", "NTA, you were respectful and even offered solutions. It\u2019s a work event, they aren\u2019t the hosts and they don\u2019t get to decide on the tone for the evening. \n\nThey are salty that you\u2019re not religious enough, let them leave.", "NTA and as someone who has had to endure two separate company led prayers in the last month, I would love a boss like you. If it was truly about saying grace for your employees, they should have no issue doing so privately. When dining out, do they need to lead an entire restaurant in prayer before they eat? Why was it important on this occasion to force everyone to participate? This feels like them trying to force you to take a public religious position with all of your employees, which is extremely inappropriate. Good riddance to them.", "NTA, and thank you. I wish more people acted like you did. It was polite, accommodating and respectful of everyone involved. They were free to pray; they just couldn't make everyone else participate.\n\nI agree that you're being set up for a challenge, though -- if not a lawsuit, then at least a social media campaign/barrage.", "NTA - what they asked for was simply inappropriate in a business setting (which this would still be considered, as a 'company party').\n\nIt actually opens you up to others feeling weird that it happened. Them bringing up your own religion was absolute nonsense, because unlike them, YOU have the decency to remain neutral in a crowd of EMPLOYEES. They could easily have lead their own, quietly, together. This was nothing more than a bullying attempt by them.\n\nTell your wife that regardless of the time put in by these employees, they are an HR nightmare and trying to shove their beliefs and demands onto everyone else. Don't try to keep them - replace them with people who will respect the word \"No\" from their BOSSES and have the decent to not shove their beliefs onto those around them.", "NTA. In fact, if they want to rope the entire party into saying grace, then I reserve the right to hum the Harry Potter soundtrack from start to finish before they eat.", "NTA they don't want to be respectful to their god, they want to make everyone else be respectful.  They fact they turned down the opportunity to do it separately with their families means they want everyone to do it, either to try to pressure people to convert or to make sure their beliefs are seen as dominate to others.  In stead of trying to get them to stay on, get on the phone with a recruitment agency and get some temp staff to cover until you can fill their spot.  They are trying to pressure you to kowtow to their will", "NTA. You are responsible for everyone feeling welcome and your employees were free to say grace by themselves before coming to the table. Inflicting their religious beliefs and practices in others at a work event is not inclusive and smacks of Trumpism. No one is preventing them from practicing their religion, it just doesn\u2019t belong at a work event.", "NTA. You gave them the opportunity to pray on their own and they decided grace wasn\u2019t important anymore since they didn\u2019t have an audience. Probably the same people who claim christianity is under attack too.", "NTA. I think you handled this great. You gave them options which were more than generous", "NTA. Agree with another commenter that prayer does not need to be showy.", "NTA You didn't stop them from saying their own grace to themselves. You stopped them from forcing the entire party to experience them saying grace.", "NTA. You didn't ban them from praying quietly at their own table.", "NTA. I think of you allowed the prayer, you would have opened yourself up to issues with non religious employees. I think you could compromise and offer to announce a moment of silence before the meal for any person who chooses to SILENTLY offer a prayer.", "NTA. Some people are more religious than others even within the same faith. Those employees could have just prayed amongst themselves at their table. A group prayer would only have worked if every single employee was of the same faith and practicing said faith. Or if each group of differing faith did a group prayer. But then there would be those that aren't of any faith and they shouldn't have to deal with each prayer.", "NTA \n\nYour other employees didn\u2019t agree to be proselytized to in the work place. Anyone and everyone is welcome to say whatever prayer they wish before they eat - but not to pray over others at (a non-religious) work place. They could have said their prayer amongst themselves. They could have used a mtg room to meet amongst themselves and pray. They could have quietly prayed right then and there.", "NTA. saying grace and imposing it on all the employees leaves you liable and opens you up to religious discrimination.  I think you handled it well, you gave them 2 solid fair options. If they want to leave, it's probably for the best that they leave.", "NTA.  I hate when I\u2019m at a professional gathering and there\u2019s a prayer said.  I feel like you accommodated their request without forcing their religion on the rest of the group.  I would definitely consult with an attorney.  It sounds insane but you never know.", "NTA\n\nBe prepared for a bogus lawsuit in fron of a GOP judge", "NTA. As an atheist, I just want to say thank you for treating your personal religious convictions as just that: Personal. They are your beliefs alone and should have absolutely no effect on anyone but you. \n\nInsisting on saying a Grace collectively is the opposite of that. It disrespects the personal beliefs of any and everyone who does not share theirs. \n\nFor these employees to just suddenly decide that it\u2019s a good enough reason to cease their own employment (though, apparently, it never was before) is pretty narrow-minded and stupid.", "Your response was perfect, letting each individual fulfill there spiritual needs in there own way is how it should be, you can't force someone to pray in a certain religion when it's not what they believe", "NTA, by any stretch of the imagination. I am non-religious, but lived in a rural, very evangelical area for a long time. They always had Christians prayers at luncheons, any public meetings, etc. and it forced people to participate. It was very uncomfortable for those of us that were non-religious, atheist, Jewish, Hindu, and Muslim, but they did not care. You did the right thing. They have the right to say a prayer for themselves if they like, but they don't need to say grace in front of the whole room and force the issue on others. I like to remind evangelicals that Matthew 6:6 says \"when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen\".", "NTA - They can sit for a moment and privately say grace. You are not required to lead a group prayer, and I appreciate this as an athiest who does not enjoy being forced to sit through them.", "NTA.  Good riddance.", "NTA and thank you for not inflicting that on your employees.\n\nI worked for a Christian physician practice. Do you know how many times the doctors or anyone said grace before a meal. Zero. It happened zero times.", "NTA. Hope the door doesn't hit them where the imaginary sky daddy split them.", "NTA, IMO.  \n\n\nI feel like they kind of put you in a no-win situation; if you were to say grace at the table, then you're subjecting/forcing each and every individual to religious beliefs, even those that may not be practicing any, and that's a tough situation. Especially since you said, what you do personally (Go to church, pray, mass, etc), shouldn't have an overlap with business.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other no-win situation is the one you're in now, by not hosting grace at the table, they paint you as the asshole for telling them to pray in a circle, if that's what they feel like they need and lose some senior and tenured employees.  \n\n\nI don't think you're the asshole at all, I think you handled it really well and did give them some additional avenues to focus on prayer if needed.", "NTA and if they\u2019re willing to quit over this I doubt that their requests would have ended there. You didn\u2019t stop them from praying, you stopped them from forcing everyone else to be apart of it.", "NTA. Your were right to disallow them to say grace out loud, tacitly forcing everyone else to listen.  Most actual Christians say something silently before a public meal if they say grace before every meal.  These people were posturing/forcing their customs on others.", "NTA at all! \n\nYou are 100% correct that it would be inappropriate to pray with everyone at a work holiday party. You seem like a really thoughtful and considerate person. Please don't change that about yourself. You did nothing wrong. \n\nYou even gave them your blessing to pray together as a group before entering the dining room if they wished. That was already going above and beyond. \n\nIf they're uncomfortable eating without praying first, they could always pray silently before they dig in like most people do in this kind of scenario.\n\nIt's suuuuuuper weird that they all quit over this. Has me wondering if this newer employee stirred the pot or something, and why.", "NTA at all. They brought religion in to what should be a religiously neutral territory. You didn't tell them they couldn't say grace, just that they couldn't force grace in everyone else. You respected everyone's position with that offer. Honestly, it feels like these people were looking for an opportunity to make a scene. You were more than accommodating. This situation is purely on them.", "NTA If I was you, then I would take their resignations as the gifts they are.  Now you don't have to put up with them anymore and they don't have a leg to stand on if they try to sue for religious discrimination.", "NTA. They are really overreacting. Religion has no place in the workplace. I\u2019m sure if someone else had asked to do a prayer of a different religion those same people would have had an issue with that too. You just can\u2019t please everyone.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing, and we all know if you had allowed a prayer but let it be Hindu, Muslim, etc., these same people would have flipped out. Thank you for standing up to these Christian bullies.", "NTA. I hope they can find jobs...Hobby Lobby and Chick FIL A are hiring...", " NTA. why couldn\u2019t they pray at their seats or outside like you suggested? you did what was appropriate.", "Ugh, I tell that type that religion is like a penis. It's fine and dandy to have one but when you bring it out in public and try shoving it down other peoples' throats uninvited, we have an issue.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Say grace privately.  If you have to make a big deal about it,  it's not from the heart.", "NTA. I think you handled that situation perfectly.", "NTA - Just because they don\u2019t want to be inclusive of others, doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be. I would cut my losses with them if they are leaving over this matter. Even if they decide to stay, it probably won\u2019t be for much longer.", "I learned a lesson a long time ago to not try to talk someone into staying after they hand in their resignation. They are the jerks for pushing this and making this power play. If you convince them to stay, expect more entitlement and this type of behavior. They want to make the work place LESS inclusive. Good riddance.", "NTA. I\u2019m betting one of them (probably the new employee) got the others all riled up about this issue. It sounds like they are being self righteous pricks thinking that it\u2019s ok to force other to sit through their prayers. There was nothing stopping them from saying a prayer silently to themselves.", "NTA\n\nYou handled the situation perfectly. As others have said, though, it's probably a good idea to run this past your lawyer, just to make sure you're protected.", "NTA.\n\nAs a Jewish person, I hate having Christianity shoved down my throat. \n\nBosses like you are the reason good employees stick around.", "NTA.", "I'd say good riddance. All five giving notice at once sounds like an attempt to armstrong you into letting religious staff into your company routine. NTA", "NTA\n\nThose employees are.
