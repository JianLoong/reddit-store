It is insanely frustrating (I teach upper grade mathematics) when I have a parent come in because their child is doing poorly because said child won\u2019t: do their homework, take notes, pay attention\u2026 And then I have to sit through an hour after school or before school conference with them telling me how their child is such a special snowflake and shouldn\u2019t have to put in any effort because it\u2019s my job to make them learn and I\u2019m not doing my job right if their child isn\u2019t making an effort. Like\u2026what? Your job as the parent is to teach your kids and my job as the teacher is to come along beside you and help them learn things you aren\u2019t able to teach them yourself, not to take over for you! It is so very frustrating."]}
