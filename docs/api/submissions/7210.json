It\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to prepare their children for adulthood. \n\nOne of our family friend\u2019s kids was the most extreme example and was the student of one of my own parents. \u201cIt\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault.

I know better than them even though the last time I read anything that wasn\u2019t the back of a cereal box was assigned reading in high school back in the \u201870s.\u201d  And other lies.

He just games all day. The enabling mother\u2019s health is declining and he\u2019ll be screwed once she passes since he\u2019s never done a thing in his own.\n\nIt\u2019s for certain that not all teachers know what they\u2019re doing, but I think most do and the common denominator here is that family unit.\n\nEven the best school with the best funding and best educators can\u2019t work wonders without parent involvement and support.
