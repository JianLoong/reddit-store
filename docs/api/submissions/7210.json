You did the right thing.\n\nYour cousins are a tragedy about to happen in the near future when a girl rejects them.", "NTA, things might have been more comfortable if you bit your tongue and it\u2019s not likely that you would have any influence on your aunt and uncle\u2019s child rearing. However, they knew your mom is a teacher and had no care for her sensibilities. I would\u2019ve been hard pressed not to say it Ruined dinner or not.", "NTA\n\nThere is another reason for following the rules in a classroom, if there is an emergency, fire, tornado, earthquake, etc, teachers need students to follow instructions to keep them safe. Kids refusing to listen and wanting to run around instead of staying close as a group creates chaos and makes it much more difficult in an emergency. Unfortunately I have seen kids that hate following rules and when safety drills are called these kids make it difficult for their teachers in making sure their classes are safe and every student accounted for.", "NTA wtf kind of thing is that to say about a teacher, let alone TO a teacher?", "I think your aunt is the asshole, she should've taught her child what and what not to do, I also think she needed to hear that she's raising an infantile child, I mean they can't even shower by themselves, that should say something alone.", "NTA - as someone who has been infantilized when growing up in a different way (not taught how to do necessary things, neglected, not allowed any independence or control in my life) you are totally right.

The way their parents are raising them is destructive to them, their futures, and their understanding of how the World works.  What a mess.\n\nI personally view raising children that way as a form of child abuse.... it's neglectful of teaching them how to function, and leaves them at a gross disadvantage going forward.  They're basically setting them up to be ostracized for their bad behavior, and have no friends.  It's a lousy thing to do, and when (if) they realize that later, they're apt to resent their parents for not actually BEING parents and teaching them better.", "NTA. Good on defending teachers.

I have 3 adult daughters, they are my princesses but they were never treated as such.

Ugh, these AHs would be the first to sue the school if their kid was injured by another kid running in the hall.\n\nDo people have amnesia about childhood?

Your uncle made a very insulting comment about your mother and anyone else that works in education.  Way to stand up for your mom and to give them a dose of reality!", "NTA. You are and adult. You are allowed to voice an opinion at the table. Children need guidance in order to learn how to become productive adults. That is one of the jobs of a parent - to provide that guidance. Your aunt and uncle seem to not be providing guidance to your cousins. They choose to point fingers at others who do, blaming them for the ills of society. They opening insulted your mother! You had every right to speak up. (Your response was much more calm and mannerly than mine would have been.)", "Children need rules and boundaries. Decipline is needed until adulthood. That's what the parents are for. Guidance. Parents that set their children up for failure are working more on their feelings.

He had at one point complained that his previous school district was unfair with grading.  Seeing his grades - yeah I can understand what was actually happening.  I was not terribly surprised when he transferred out of the district at the end of the school year.

Did your aunt go to school?  Did your uncle ho to school?  If so, what do they remember about the experience if learning in school when they were children?  What do they believe a totally chaotic school environment would mean for their children\u2019s educational progress?\nDo they recall themselves as children with no control over themselves (since they now believe that is the only behavior one can expect from children)?\n\nAsk them when and how they became adults?  Was it on a birthday that was recognized as the portal from childhood to adulthood?  Is that how they believe their children will become adults? If so, do they believe that  adulthood arrives with no preparation, practice, or learning?  Does it just show up full blown on a birthday?  Is that how they became adults?\n\nWhy aren\u2019t they home schooling their children to save the children from that worst school ever they now attend?  Don\u2019t they live their children?

Show the world how it should be done.\n\nI suspect your relatives do not believe any of what they complain about.  You are a teacher and they know how to pull your chain by suggesting you aren\u2019t very smart and you have no idea how a school should be run.  Watching you react is how they get their jollies.

So much that your mom felt uncomfortable about it.  \n\n\nI cant understand what drives it or how we got here, but its responsible for a ton of the societal problems we have at the larger scale.
