You paid the rehoming fee and after that it's your pup. They didn't have time for the pup, so they rehomed it, and you don't have time to send pics of the pup because you're raising it.", "NTA: tell her you will send one pic and would prefer no more contact", "NTA. They\u2019re sad and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to explain to a little kid why the puppy isn\u2019t there anymore. It would be a kindness, a courtesy, to send them a picture to reassure them that the puppy is happy so they have some form of closure. But it\u2019s not a requirement and you\u2019re not a bad person for not engaging in it.", "NTA.\n\nSend one pic if you want to.\n\nTell them you will not be communicating with them at this point.\n\nBlock them if you can.", "NTA. I had a coworker who adopted a kitten and the people kept wanting to come over and visit the kitten and bring other cats over for play dates. She tried letting them down nicely but they were so persistent she had to block them. Thankfully they didn\u2019t know her address. It\u2019s nice they loved the animals so much they want to stay connected but you\u2019re not obligated to meet their emotional needs.", "NTA.  Send one pic and tell her that\u2019s it", "NTA.  The puppy is now yours as they relinquished all rights to him.  They cannot reasonably expect you to provide frequent pictures if you are not inclined.  That said, I personally would be willing to provide an occasional picture to a sad little girl once in a while.  Poor thing lost her pet in this transaction.", "NTA. I personally would send a few pics and tell them that's it.  I don't get the rehoming fee, you're kinda doing them a favor and I don't see how they expect money for that.", "NTA and you're right, it is not okay for them to ask you for pics on a daily basis. However, thinking of the kid who obviously didn't want the puppy gone, I'd be willing to offer to send them a pic here and there (say, every other week or so for starters then once a month) for a while, to reassure them that the dog is doing great and for the girl to see it. My thinking process is that you won't have to do this for an extended period of time, because kids have a short attention span and she will think of the dog less and less, as time goes by.\n\nBut make it clear that you will send the pics whenever it suits you, and provided they stop pestering you on a daily basis.", "NTA - As heartless as it sounds to say, this was a transactional relationship for which nothing is owed after the transaction is complete. I would understand if they periodically checked on the dog out of missing him or still caring about his welfare, but daily is excessive.", "NTA. She probably doesn't know how to handle the situation without upsetting her daughter and tries to put part of this burden on you. As a parent she is responsible for dealing with this, not you.", "Just find a random pic of the same breed and send that or don\u2019t bother replying", "Info: have you sent a picture before? How many times has she contacted you?\n\nI generally have a low opinion of people who rehome animals, but since this couple sold the puppy as a puppy (instead of as an older dog), it seems they did have the puppy's best interests at heart. I got my dog from a breeder. I sent her pictures and even brought him to see her and play with her dogs. Each year on their birthday, everyone who bought a puppy from that litter sent a photo so we could see our dog's siblings. So, without more information, I don't know if what she's asking is harassment. She could feel guilty for selling the puppy to a stranger and wants to know he is doing well. A few quick messages could relieve her guilt.", "NTA - wth was the fee for? Sorry but if someone adopts/buys a puppy and then decides to rehome the puppy - why are they charging a fee - it just sounds greedy to me. \n\nNo pictures for them!", "ESH\n\nYou should have sent her a few photos for her daughter and told her that would be all, I don't see the point in ignoring her.\n\nAnd she should have just asked for one photo instead of harassing you every day.", "Soft ESH\u2026 they shouldn\u2019t be harassing you so much, but how hard would it be to send them some pics? I had to rehome a dog, due to the dog really needing a more rural/less suburban environment, and I was devastated. I was basically in mourning but it helped that the new owners sent me a few pictures of her over the first several months that showed how much happier she was. Not a lot, like one a month or even one every 2-3 months and maybe one even a year or so after she went to them, but they really helped immensely.", "I might have agreed to send one round of pictures to show that the dog is happy in their new environment, but not every day. That\u2019s unreasonable, and intrusive. \n\nI was in a position once where it was best for the dog that I rehomed him. It was nice to have confirmation I made the right decision for him when I saw how happy he was with his new owner. I was unexpectedly living alone in a studio apartment with no yard, working a demanding job with a long commute. I didn\u2019t have the means to hire a dog walker or send him to doggy daycare. He was miserable inside by himself all day. He went to live with a friend of my mother\u2019s. She was retired, and she had a beautiful yard for him to run around in. She also had kids and grandchildren around frequently to spoil him as well. She\u2019d send me pictures every now and again of his hijinks with them, and it was a nice comfort knowing he was better off. Granted, I knew her so it was different. I never asked, though.", "NTA and chip your dog before the lady gets loony-er", "Nta. That\u2019s annoying. \n\nI had a dog. She was my world. But as my world grew and I had more kids and we moved, she became very miserable. She became extremely food aggressive and no matter how many training classes we took, she would resume her ways. She eventually attacked my already disabled cat and began resource guarding any object she could whenever my new baby would be in the same room as her. It was heartbreaking because she was an incredible dog otherwise and I love her so much. She eventually stopped wanting to sleep in my bed with me and started sleeping in the hallways and then she started ignoring my older kid who she had, so far, grown up with. I couldn\u2019t even take her on walks anymore without my husband because she started pulling and trying to attack any other animal she\u2019d see. Which was SO unlike her a year prior. Again, more training solved nothing. We could just see the misery on her face. I eventually met this old wealthy couple that lived on a huge pasture and rescued animals. They had rescue horses, cows, and donkeys. They also had a dog just like mine, but their dog passed away a few months before we met. They immediately asked if they could take my dog and I struggled at first but knew this was the right thing to try. And it sure was. Immediately, she was SO happy. She sleeps on their bed. She doesn\u2019t need her leash because she stays by their side. She runs with the horses and donkey. She gets to explore the land all day and come sleep by the fire at night. She has no other dog or cat or small human to feel threatened by. And she is thriving. \n\nIt\u2019s been hard. I want to text them every day still and ask how she\u2019s doing. Ask for pictures. But I DONT because that would be inappropriate. She\u2019s their dog now. Doesn\u2019t matter how much I miss her. That\u2019s a boundary line I don\u2019t cross because it\u2019s not right. I do however, keep my patience. They send pics every now and again and let me know how happy she is. I sent my love on her birthday only to let them know it was her birthday and I knew they\u2019d want to celebrate it. And any leftover meds I had on auto order, I mailed out to her. But no- I don\u2019t bother them. And they wouldn\u2019t be assholes for asking me not to. \n\nIt\u2019s your dog now. Protect your peace and move forward.", "Let's reframe this: You did not pay a \"re-homing\" fee.\n\nYou BOUGHT a puppy.\n\nDon't let this person establish rights that weren't previously agreed to, after the fact, by pushing you into actions you don't want to do.\n\nWhat's next? My child misses HER dog that we've graciously allowed you to physically and financially take responsibility for but we retain ownership so bring the puppy for visits at your time and expense!?\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "It's not unreasonable for someone to make sure that the animal they'd just adopted out is doing well.  Send one or two pics for their peace of mind but block them if they demand updates.\n\nWhen I adopted my youngest cat, the previous foster mother checked in a few months afterward to make sure everything was still okay.  We sent her a pic to assure her that the cat had settled in nicely.  She wished us and the cat well and that was the last contact we had with her.  (Kitty is still happy and healthy and is sitting behind me in my chair.)", "NTA.  We found a mom and pup.  Rehomed the pup (they are always the easiest).  Then only thing I ask is that the new \u201cparents\u201d contact me if there\u2019s any issues with the pup settling in.", "Everytime they ask for a pic, just send them a random dog pic found on the internet.  Bonus if each day it's a different breed.", "NTA. It's sad that she misses the puppy but she doesn't get to own him by proxy. \n\nI'd be pretty comfortable writing a polite message to say that unfortunately you don't have time to be sending pictures, you're a bit taken abach tbh to be getting so many messages from her, which wasn't in the rehoming agreement, and you won't be able to respond any more. Then block with a clear conscience.", "I gave away my German Shepard at 18 after five years of him living outside on a chain. (My father's way of letting me keep dogs since we had a farm) \n\nI knew he'd need a better life, and I didn't ask for pictures after selecting his new owners. They sent me 3 pictures in 7 years following. His end of a first week. A couple years later at random thanking me. And the day he passed.\n\n NTA for being annoyed if it's daily. But you can always give them (the daughter) closure by sending an update and telling them that you're thankful for the new friend and will remember their kindness to rehome. \"... Lastly I'd like to update on my own time after he's graduated training or in a couple years when he's full grown. Thank you.\"", "I don't know, I'm not feeling a ton of sympathy for the previous owners. It's one thing if you get a puppy and it brings out a heretofore unknown allergy, or you lose your job and can't afford to keep it. But just deciding you don't have time? That seems pretty flaky to me.\n\nI also don't love the idea of a \"rehoming fee.\" If they just had the puppy's best interests at heart, they wouldn't feel the need to recoup their investment.", "Rehoming fees are often suggested to keep a pet away from animal hoarders or abusers. A person who's serious about the animal (and can afford to take care of it) won't balk at a moderate fee, but folks involved in backyard breeding or dogfights will just scroll down to the \"free to a good home\" listings.", "A rehoming fee is a must and it serves as a way to have the animals best interests at heart. People willing to pay a rehoming fee typically genuinely want to give the animal a good home. There are too many people with ill intentions towards animals and will actively seek out \"free to a good home\" offers. Requiring a rehoming fee acts as a way to weed out those who don't intend to actually care for it as a pet but use it for dog fighting or other awful reasons. Its not about making money off the animal but ensuring whoever is taking it in legitimately wants it and will care for it properly.", "I've heard people ask for rehoming fees to be sure the new owner really wants it, but I've never had any experience rehoming animals. And I agree it is flaky to get a dog when you don't have time for it. You met the woman and were able to gauge her sincerity--I didn't and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Just yesterday, I posted something on social media discussing the cruelty of rehoming animals. \n\nYears ago (forty or more), a stray showed up in our neighborhood. My parents took it in because they were afraid he would be euthanized if he were taken to the pound. Although large, he was still a puppy and intimidated our other dog and cats with his rambunctious behavior. My parents just couldn't keep him. They worked with our vet to find a good home for him. It turned out to be a great situation for the dog. The new owner had lots of experience with large dogs, and it was heartwarming to see how happy the dog seemed with the man. It is the only time we have ever gotten rid of an animal, and we have taken in our share of stray animals over the years. However, I don't think the two situations (my parents' and your puppy's prior owner) compare. \n\nAt any rate, I don't think you are wrong for refusing to send pictures. NTA.", "I understand that logic, I just don't really buy it. Presumably they were screening people anyway, and not just giving the puppy away to the first person who shows up at the door."]}
