So, its amazing to go to restaurants with him as its like eating with your own  clone who eats more than you.", "[removed]", "Why should he have to?  He doesn't want to share his food.  What she does with her brother is irrelevant.", "That\u2019s a great idea.", "Why can't she just order two things and enjoy it and then pack up the leftovers? Nothing's stopping her from having an experience. What she is doing is trying to stop the husband from his experience.", "This, finally someone who gets it. I will occasionally not get my favorite food option, so the people with whom I am out for food with can also enjoy it and we just have a great time.", "How is it wasteful? Take it home and have leftovers the following day. Easy solution.", "every person has their own way to show love ...just because your husband shows how much he loves you like this does not mean if others dont do it ...that they do not love their partners .......Everybody has a love language of their own . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you are into a relationship you make sacrifices , if OP wife didn't wanna move she would have not moved but this does not mean he got to now , do everything for her .\n\nthats something she has with her brother and if her husband is not comfortable doing , he doesnt have to .", "what makes you think you have any right to comment on what somebody else ..way of spending their money  ?  lol", "so if you dont like sharing food ....why you think ,him doing something ,that keeps him from preventing to share food ,is bad ?\n\nyour wife got the picture ..that you dont share ...his wife didnt ...she the AH", "What else were they meant to do? Let OP be jobless/low income so she can stay with her brother?", "And what happens when she goes out with friends or workmates?  Are they supposed to participate in this bizarre food swapping game?", "And she can get used to not doing it.", "My sister and I always do this. My partner and I only do when we are both wanting the same couple things. But most of the time we want stuff that's totally different and I'm ok with that.\n\nEven if I were visiting my sister and she didn't want to do that I'd be fine with it. We just tend to like the same things and it's nice to try multiple things and share our opinions. But if someone tried to force me to order something I didn't want to do that it would annoy me.", "I share meals with almost everyone- family, friends, coworkers, SOs- but I always ask them first. If they say no, I do the mature thing of respecting the other person\u2019s choice. Is she often dismissive of your wants in other areas or is this a one off?", "She called you an AH or mean or something? Did she drop it afterwards or is she still pushing for it every time you guys go out to eat? And does this happen often; it\u2019s only about Alfredo sauce, so I asume this only happens like a few times a year?", "So?", "No. By your logic, she would do that with EVERYBODY she goes to a restaurant with. Co- workers? Her boss? Your boss? People she's meeting for the first time? See, the beauty of being an adult is that we can rationalize and adapt.", "Cool now she will get used to not doing that. Simple", "She may be lonely as I assume the move has challenges.", "Lovely. \ud83d\ude06\n\nNow I\u2019m just hungry and craving pasta.", "He literally said that it was a thing she does with her brother. Kind of a specific mention there. First paragraph, first three sentences.", "He does not expect her to eat it,SHE is the one wanting him to not eat his favorite food so SHE can eat or try his food.", "Sorry? \n\nYou might wanna re-read his post for context.\n\nHe\u2019s not the one wanting her to eat it. The sharing thing is the wife\u2019s thing.\n\nThe man doesn\u2019t mind sharing but just wants to have his Alfredo sauce.\n\nSo let the man not share and have his Alfredo sauce when he wants it.\n\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s refusing to share his food, he just wants to eat Alfredo (which I assume is not 100% of the time but even if it was, it should be his prerogative). \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem at all like a huge ask to be able to go out and eat what you wanna eat.\n\nI see something wrong with compelling someone to order food you like every time just so you can share because \u201cit\u2019s your thing.\u201d", "Think you might have accidentally replied to me instead of op, myfriend. Good suggestion though!", "I have to say I'm a little surprised that this is an issue just because of the Alfredo sauce. Do you *always* get a dish with that same sauce when you're not sharing, regardless of what place you're eating in...? Is it that extremely common where you live? \n\nEither way obviously you should be ordering what you want to eat, and the fact that she told you to stop ordering something that you like is definitely extreme. Perhaps it would be possible to compromise sometimes when you'd also be okay with eating something else (that you like), but if you really don't want to share food, that's also valid.", "Right? Most of my family loves to share dishes except for one of my older brothers. He *does not* share food. He will buy you your own but he will not share his and it's a really easy thing to respect. We might all be sharing and he'll be fine eating his food and not asking for anyone else's. He'll only begrudgingly allow a bite if it's our mother.", "I think the framing of it being because of her brother is a bit odd unless there's more to it than written here, it could simply be that he was the only other person she went out to eat with frequently. I know many people who basically want to eat family style at every restaurant they can, and she could just be one of those people. \n\nThe wording of the post seems to imply he wasn't bothered by sharing, he was bothered by being asked to not order his favorite dish when it's available. The majority of restaurants don't have alfredo sauce (at least where I live) so I was curious how frequently it's an issue.", "Cause it's a waste of $20+ and it's not the experience she wants. She wants the sharing thing. What he is doing is trying to stop the wife from her experience.", "Exactly. If OP wants to be extra nice he can order the Alfredo dish to-go and save it for the next day, and share his wife\u2019s food that night.", "It's not about the brother at all. But moves, like kids are a two yeses, one no, or breakup kind of deal.", "While I don't think her husband has to participate, it also isn't odd. I'm in the US, and when I go out with friends or family, we typically order a bunch of appetizers and mains off the menu, and everyone eats what they like. \n\nIt's so we can try all the dishes that look appealing instead of being limited to one or two things.  I have one friend who always orders separately, but that's ok too. Sharing dishes at a restaurant isn't any different than sharing food at home.", "[removed]", "Good question!", "Yeah, in the US it's called family style to serve a bunch of dishes and a stack of plates. I do that everywhere. If people want to get their own meal that's perfectly fine and they are still entitled to share from the commu al meals. It's a great way to share and to try a bunch of different dishes.", "[removed]", "Yes when he complained that she doesn't share food with him. If he wants to eat his favorite food which no-one likes then he has to eat it alone. Why force feed someone?", "It was a karma farming bot, not an actual person.", "It may not be the experience she wants but how is it a waste of money? If they take it away and store it properly it\u2019s a perfectly good meal. The only way it would be a waste is if they threw the leftovers out.", "You\u2019re right. And OP is still NTA. But sounds like they need a compromise indeed. There\u2019s more food than \u201conly Alfredo sauce\u201d so I\u2019m sure that sharing occasionally will work. But OP\u2019s experience is equally important: enjoying food he loves while in the company of his wife.", "But in this instance she clearly said yes, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be living in a different state. Or as you said broken up already", "Why are you assuming they didn't make a joint decision to move? I assumed he is just acknowledging she was missing her brother.", "It's her insistence that he must not order what he wants so she can go through this ritual.  \nIt's one thing to check in with your partner: \"sharsies tonight, or so you want your own?\" and then accepting if he says he wants his own.  But to tell him he can't order his preference to cater to her wants is just controlling.\n\nThe man wants Alfredo, obviously doesn't get it at home, so leave him be.  I have a friend who always orders pork when he's visits.  His wife is a Muslim, so he never eats it at home, so when he is out, that's just what he wants to eat.  Why shouldn't he get what he wants to order?", "I second this, UK here, not unusual to order many dishes and share them around the table. I mean it's usually agreed first but I feel a lot of these people just don't communicate with each other.", "you didn't actually read the post did you?", "I suggest re reading the OP", "I didn't say he was the AH. I purposely didn't give a verdict because I gelt.it would take away from my point. Nor did I ever imply that OPs experience wasn't important. Maybe you meant to reply to someone else?", "The wording, but like I said it implies it. OP can correct me. Which is why I asked a question for clarification", "My wife recently asked me what caused me to come up with the somewhat bizarre set of toppings that I ALWAYS order on my pizzas.  I explained that it dated back to my childhood when I got tired of half of my pizza getting eaten by others who all wanted to \"try a piece\" of mine, when I had no interest whatsoever in sharing whatever it was they were eating and I was fully capable of eating on my own the entire pizza that I ordered.  \n\nSo my topping list is a carefully curated collection that includes one or more topping that each member of my family dislikes strongly enough that they will refrain from \"trying\" any of my food.", "I said it was OK if her husband doesn't want to share with her. That's a compatibility issue she'll have to decide if she can live with (I wouldn't marry someone who only ever eats Alfredo, but that's me). I only disagreed that it was a \"bizarre game,\" like food sharing is unheard of. Where I come from, it's normal.", "How much \"insistence\" was there though? From the post it seems like she _asked_, rather than insisted (the word please was mentioned, according to OP) and asked only _once_ . And he blew up, because he thinks this is a \"bizarre request\", just like you do.\n\nIt seems like a culture clash, more than anything else\n\nI come from a \"sharing culture\" - while eating out, we (family and friends) always order \"for the table\". I like spicy food - my dad and sister don't. We don't eat spicy food when we are out all together - I leave that for when I'm out with a group that's into it, or for when we order in. If I absolutely detested food without spice, then we would have found a different compromise - but \"everybody order their own\" is not a compromise any of us would be happy with. That would defeat the very purpose of eating out _together_ - it's \"bizzare\" to me. \n\nSeems like his wife is from a similar culture, and so _asked_ if he would consider adapting his orders so she feels like they're eating together. It's fine for her to ask they order only things _both_ of them enjoy, and for him to say no he wants to eat what he wants to eat. It's not fine for her to call him an asshole (OP doesn't say she did), and it's not fine for him to say she's 'bizarre' or 'wrong' for wanting the eating experience she wants. \n\nRelationships (platonic or romantic) are all about compromises - they need to negotiate one.", "I really want to know what your toppings are now.", "This is brilliant! I am one of those few people that like anchovies, so I usually find that ordering that as a topping usually ensures that no one else wants any.", "It's normal for me too. And a couple of my Asian friends do the same thing (one is from Korea and the other Japan)\n\nOne of the restaurants I used to work at, people would often order \"family style\" which meant extra plates and serving utensils. So at least in since places it's totally normal.", "So do I. And I\u2019m going to order this pizza to spite this person\u2019s family."]}
