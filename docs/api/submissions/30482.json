I like spicy food - my dad and sister don't. We don't eat spicy food when we are out all together - I leave that for when I'm out with a group that's into it, or for when we order in. If I absolutely detested food without spice, then we would have found a different compromise - but \"everybody order their own\" is not a compromise any of us would be happy with. That would defeat the very purpose of eating out _together_ - it's \"bizzare\" to me. \n\nSeems like his wife is from a similar culture, and so _asked_ if he would consider adapting his orders so she feels like they're eating together.

If it's a dish like a shared appetizer or a \"meal for 2\" then you should agree to whatever it is. But for your personal entree you should get what you like. The whole idea of sharing food is to try different things and see if you like what the other person ordered. Dictating to that person what they're allowed to have because of your preferences isn't a good way to handle it. If she had an allergy or something that would be different to me. If she didn't like what you were ordering because of how it makes your breath smell or how it tastes when she kisses you, that's different too.

I will never understand what the issue is here. Does it make it better if it is presented as we are going to go out, order two entree for the table to share? Cause that is what we are talking about here.", "But that's not what he said. He said he was fine with it. Until she asked him to not do alfredo sauce.", "You've got me craving a place I've never been to. But it must be so much worse for you! Actually knowing how great that place was..", "You know there are nearly 350 million Americans, right? California ***alone***  is fairly comparable to just England in size, population, and GDP.", "(What's outside the norm in the US? Everyone I know shares to some degree, certainly \"appetizers for the table\", and \"you get the short ribs and I'll get the haddock, and we will split each\", is usual. Those who do not share, especially when ordering Chinese or Thai dishes, and they eat only their \"own\",  except when getting the 'combo plate', that's weird)", "that wasn't a part of the comment I replied to. \n\nthey said nothing about insisting anything. they said \n\n>Are they supposed to participate in this bizarre food swapping game?\n\nas if its insane to share 2 dishes so you can try two things....", "A night for sharing? I'm literally confounded by this I guess.  A night for sharing would be pizza, or family style, or sushi, or a buffet maybe. \n\nAre people actually slicing up their food and scraping half their food into each other's plates?", "The wording implies nothing specific. You've personally framed it to having this meaning. \n\nReframing it, it could mean he's thoughtful of and recognizes her sacrifice. \n\nReframing it again, it could mean they had no other viable choice but to move and his job was the catalyst.", "That\u2019s fine. We all have different boundaries", "I'm saying it's an insane bizarre food swapping game by definition if one person insists that the other strategically order food to facilitate it.", "Yes. People share entrees.", "I\u2019ve never seen the show, but if ordering just a bucket of ONLY extra crispy chicken skin was an option, I would absolutely order that.\n\nIt\u2019d be worth the heart attack I\u2019d eventually have.", "you didn't make the comment I replied to. if you want to run around holding goalposts then have at it! \n\nit has nothing to do with me if you want to ree about her trying to impose a conditioon on her partner. that isn't what I commented on... go have that discussion with someone who wants to discuss that with you instead of trying to shoe horn that detail into a discussion about a different part of the post. \n\nyou're so immature.", "When they want to.", "If you have a good grocery store, you can ask them for the chicken skins from the meat they butcher.", "I was responding to the idea that doing things that way at all is \"bizarre.\" I'm not saying she's right, he can order what he wants and he doesn't have to share even if he got something she would like. But the idea of sharing food isn't as weird as one commenter said.\n\nSo please calm down with the insults. One of the beauties of being an adult is thinking through the context of what someone says and admitting when you misunderstand.", "I don't think you know how Reddit works. I'm sorry if I upset you. Have a nice day.", "I know exactly how it works. you wanted to interject about a different detail that wasn't being discussed... I don't want to have that conversation because I wasn't talking about it. if you would like to talk about that you need to go find someone who wants to talk about it with you and not keep harassing me about it... \n\nhave the day you deserve.", "Except she's adamant about something that isn't hers. \n\nIt's weird! \n\nMy wants for my own meal wins over my partner's want for splitting dishes. \n\nIt's not the same. At all."]}
