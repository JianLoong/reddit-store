And I do the same for him in different ways (like never cooking spinach with meals despite it being one of my favourites because he dislikes it).

This usually amounts to asking her what looks good to her and if there is an overlap between the few things she\u2019s considering and the few things I\u2019m considering making a suggestion that we split X and Y.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t reserve the right to order whatever she wants.", "NTA - but maybe alternate and eat Alfredo for every second restaurant meal.\nAnother option is going to a tapas or small plate restaurant where ordering many dishes is the norm.", "NTA but occasionally ordering types of foods she likes so you all can share would be a nice thing for you to do.", "NTA but borderline.

This doesn't have to be an either/ or situation you don't need to get Alfredo sauce in everything you buy, maybe have some meals without it so you can share them, or ask for the sauce on the side so you can dip food in it but you two can both enjoy variety in a meal. Marriage and relationships are about compromise and if you take a hard line on this you may disappoint or saddden the most important person in your life.", "No. NTA\n\nI love gnocchi, my partner doesn't.
