When we were growing up he always for some reason needed to embarrass me. When I was trying to talk to girls he'd start saying embarrassing stories from my childhood like when I ran around naked or something. During a school assembly I was making a speech and he ran up with a water gun and sprayed it all over me. The whole school laughed. Luckily when I got older I was able to get away from my brother and now am happily married with my wife (29F). Unfortunately I still see him at weekly family dinners but I always try to act polite even though he still tries to pull pranks on me and no one says a thing.  My brother is married to M, (30F) and has three kids. \n\nNow onto the story:\n\nMy wife's birthday was coming up so I went out to do some shopping for her. I knew she liked clothes that were next to a coffee shop so I stopped inside the shop before heading off the store. I looked around while drinking some coffee and spotted my brother with someone who wasn't his wife. I whipped out my phone and took some pictures before zooming in to check it was really him. I finished my coffee, paid the bill and continued shopping. Last week at the family dinner is where everything came to a head. My wife and I headed over to my brother's house since he was hosting that week and in my bag I had the pictures so I couldn't privately tell my sister in law about her husband. During the dinner as usual my brother starts making jokes about me and my job which he thinks makes me a snob (just because I make more money than he does) but I just kept smiling and ate my food calmly. But then he took it too far. He moved away from jokes about me and started joking about my wife and how she looked like a \"fat cow\". I told him to stop but he didn't and then called her a slut because she slept with other men before me. That was too much. I stood up angrily and threw the pictures on the table. My sister in law's eyes widened as she took it in and then chaos ensued. She started screaming, crying, throwing things, while telling me and my wife to get out. The net morning I get texts from my mom that what I did was horrible and I just broke up a family and couldn't I discuss it privately? I feel really bad because his kids and wife are really sweet and it must have hurt to have heard the truth. Meanwhile on the other hand my wife is mad I didn't tell her first but says I did the write thing. I don't think I'm the asshole so I'm coming to you guys. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, what a weird fantasy story you\u2019ve written.", "ESH. Cheating has this weird standing in society where people think that it\u2019s not only okay to involve yourself in someone else\u2019s relationship, but that it\u2019s a moral obligation to do so. I hope it dies as a trend tbh. No one except the two people in a relationship know the details of that relationship. People getting involved in these sort of situations on their moral high horses has literally ended lives and people still can\u2019t seem to understand that they need to tread very carefully or stay out of it. In your case, not only did you stick your nose in, you humiliated his wife in front of your entire family because of your petty squabbles with your brother. Since it\u2019s cheating, everyone will tell you it\u2019s fine because culturally we say it\u2019s okay for you to insert yourself into someone else\u2019s business in this case and you have the moral high ground, even if you get someone killed or cause them to commit suicide. I disagree, not only did you do this with no regard for any of those things or whether or not it\u2019s your business, but you did it in the most public and humiliating way you could come up with. \n\nYour brother is obviously the AH for cheating. That\u2019s a given. You suck for the rest.", "NTA. Nope. NTA at all. The wife deserved to know and he deserved to have his dirty laundry aired publicly when he treats family like that. Act like a jerk, be a jerk, and this is what you get. Anyone who says you\u2019re the asshole here is just a cheater too who would be mortified if this happened to them. News flash. Don\u2019t cheat.", "ESH \n\nYou didn\u2019t show your SIL to help her, you exposed your brother as revenge. Your actions were gross and just plain rude - your actions made you just as bad as your brother.", "NTA he shouldn't have cheated or insulted people. You just showed people who he really was.", "ESH. You and your brother don't sound overly dissimilar if I'm honest; neither of you has any qualms about hurting the other's partner in a childish attempt to hurt each other. Because that's really what you did - totally hurt and humiliated SIL at dinner and in her own home. That's not how anyone should find out their partner may be cheating on them. I say may because being in public with another woman is not evidence of infidelity.\n\nI'm close to Y T A because I don't think you threw the photos down just because you lost your rag. You brought them to their house for a reason; the fact you seem to have printed them out doesn't imply you had any intention of taking your SIL aside to talk in private. You could have simply shown her the photos on your phone/camera if this was honestly the plan. It sounds like you fully planned on doing this publicly and causing a scene.\n\nEdited to add: spotted OP's comment confirming BIL def did cheat. Still not acceptable to humiliate SIL like that, in my view - I've been cheated on before and that is NOT how I'd want to find out about it.\n\nOP also AH for putting their wife in a situation where they're insulted. Horrible behaviour all round.", "I think hes the ahole and you could have handled it better...  If i had such a toxic relationship with my brother i wouldnt eat dinner with him.... And need to work on communication skills..... You should have approached your brother man to man and told him to show you and your wife more respect or you would tell his wife... Maybe he would have stopped cheating knowing that you knew?", "Honestly, I feel like this is a tough one.\n\nI want to say NTA because: OP has had it his whole life having to deal with his stupid brother trying to belittle him. He took it in the chin when it was about him, but couldn't handle it when it was about his wife. I, in his place, would have gone farther (IDK how, but I would've thought of a way to do so) if someone messed like that with y spouse.\n\nHOWEVER the SIL did not deserve that probably. Also, OP's wife kind of has a point? It would have been nice to tell your wife about it, IMO. Is there an option to be a justified AH? because that is what I would go for.", "FAAFO NTA", "ESH since you came in revenge mode and you were looking for an opportunity. Your brother got what he deserved and you got yours back. A win is win. Except for the wife and children that had to suffer publicly.", "You and your brother are both TA. Have you at any point tried to work on this dysfunctional relationship or have you just let it fester to the point that it's now affecting your respective families? Seems more like the latter.", "ESH - your brother is obviously a massive asshole for what he said but in your attempt to hurt him you also hurt his wife who is an innocent party here.\n\nAlso for context, did you see him kissing this girl or doing anything that actually proved he was cheating or was he simply just in a store with her? You could have potentially caused a massive drama/heartache over something that was actually innocent.", "I totally understand POV but how you delivered the heartbreaking news was very wrong. \n\nYou could have done it in private because cheating is very humiliating for the one who was cheated on and publicly expose it without her knowing was every wrong. \n\nYou are a soft YTA for this but your brother is the biggest asshole for cheating and harassing not only you but your innocent wife. \n\nYour mother is also an asshole for blaming you when it was her older son who destroyed his own family.", "YTA \n\nWhy would you hurt his wife? She didn\u2019t do anything to you! \n\nA conversation with your brother would have been the way to go.\nEven though it\u2019s not your business\u2026 you should have told him\u201d hey.. I saw you last week with a woman.. it didn\u2019t look good\u2026 I hope this was a work meeting because you\u2019re married to a nice lady\u2026\u201d You didn\u2019t hurt your cheating brother.. who\u2019s already a prick\u2026 you deliberately hurt his wife though.", "YTA. This reads as some high school revenge fantasy. In any event trying to humiliate your brother by destroying his wife puts you on even footing with your brother. Good job. Next time you feel that someone is treating you poorly and you have spoken up about it, you cut that person out of your life. Grow up.", "I would\u2019ve held on and blackmailed him with those photos. I would make him eat every single thing he\u2019s ever said or done. Three times.", "I'm trying to imagine exactly how incriminating photos taken in a coffee shop could be. Were they liplocking over their espresso or something? Cuz you're describing the reactions like you threw down pictures of your brother in the act of screwing another woman, not drinking coffee with her.", "NTA - public shaming is your brother\u2018s thing. He started it, you finished it.", "ESH. \n\nYour brother sounds shitty. \n\nBut you chose to blow everything up in front of family.  That is horrible.  You didn't do this as an act to protect your sister in law, you did it to embarass him since you are clearly holding on to anger from 20+ years ago.   The fact that it sounds like you printed these pictures makes me think this was your plan from the beginning, to make some dramatic thing at dinner so everyone could see.", "NTA. She deserved to know the truth and didn\u2019t stop her husband from bullying you/your wife.", "NTA and why are you parents mad now when they didn\u2019t have anything to say while he fat shamed and slut shamed your wife?", "NTA!!!", "NTA!!!", "Nta. I like your scorched earth style. Remember you didn't do this to his wife and kids, he did", "NTA \n\nYour sister in law deserved to know the man she was married to, hopefully they don't have children. \n\nCould you have gone about it better? Yeah but fuck em, cheaters don't deserve the high road.", "It's so bad.", "Also I swear this exact story was recently posted lol", "Agreed. If it wouldn\u2019t matter then op deserved to have his cake in a satisfying manner to F them all.", "\"he's probably cheating\"\n\nHe definitely was. They were kissing and hugging and snuggled up together. Sorry for any confusion. Also he doesn't have a job right now so it couldn't have been a work call", "I wasn't planning on confronting him like that. I wanted to do it privatly but when he started making hurtful jokes about my wife and wouldn't I got angry", "Oh I am in therapy. My wife actually encourage me to go.", "OP's mom is an asshole for not punishing her older son that was bullying her younger child. Then taking the older one's side after he started insulting her daughter in law. \n\nOP NTA. He deserved it, and you should probably cut contact with your family.", "Not every time someone is in the \u201cwrong\u201d they are actually wrong.", "I come right from work so I bring my bag with me and usually leave it with my coat", "Given the way he acts I don\u2019t even necessarily buy his interpretation of their relationship.", "Yes they were holding hands and kissing. Also I know it wasn't a work thing as he is now unemployed and searching for a job", "Op said they were kissing and cuddling in another comment so I really don\u2019t think it was a business outing.", "That is bullshit.  The wife didn't deserve to be humiliated like that.  The kids didn't deserve to see that. \n\nThis wasn't a situation where he alone was exposed.  There were other people involved who OP didn't give a damn about.", ">ou brought them to their house for a reason; the fact you seem to have printed them out doesn't imply you had any intention of taking your SIL aside to talk in private. You could have simply shown her the photos on your phone/camera if this was honestly the plan\n\nI made this same point.  It sounds like OP wanted a dramatic reveal, or else why print them out", "WTF? Why give him a chance to lie to your face and hold onto his secret?!  \n\nThat was not very well thought out IMO.", "Except Op was minding his business and someone started insulting him and his wife. Nahhh, there was not going to be man to man right then. It was an all for all brawl and Op unleashed his weapon.", "SIL didn't say anything when brother was humiliating both OP and Wife", "I have tried fixing our relationship and telling him how I feel but he calls me a sissy and says it was all in the past or it was just a prank", "I did see them kissing and no it wasn't a peck on the cheek it was full blown making out.", "> Why would you hurt his wife? She didn\u2019t do anything to you!\n\nThe cheating hurt the wife, not telling her about it.", "How did OP hurt his brother's wife??? On the First Hand brother was cheating... Understood the way OP spilled the beans was not good.. But he did the right thing.. NTA", "OP didn't destroy his sister in law. OP's brother did that himself.", "Lol what it's not like he faked the photos? \ud83e\udd23 I personally loved it ggs op. Ps you grow up ya lunatic", "And that's fine to expose him over, and it's fine to feel good exposing him after being an asshole throughout your life and for being a cheating asshole now. But your nieces and nephews and your SIL didn't deserve to find out that way.", "NTA \n\nWhat did your mom say about the names he was calling your wife? I take it your AH of a brother was the golden child so they ignored his constant bullying of you!", "Yes you were.  If. you weren't planning on it, you wouldn't have printed the pictures out. \n\nThis sounds like you wanted some big \"gotcha\" moment so everyone could see what was happening", "Yeah, that's because you're immature.", "OP isn\u2019t TA for what he did to the brother, it\u2019s that he did it in front of the kids and wife. That\u2019s a horrible way to find out about your parent. OP should\u2019ve handled it better!", "Exactly. Like objectively? Sure it\u2019s kinda a douchey move but with this context? Entirely deserved, based, and honestly just art.", "so why did you have your bag at the dinner table? you were just carrying these photos that you went out of your way to have printed?", "WDYM? He either has proof his brother is cheating or not?", "Well for one you don\u2019t know that he would be lying? I mean there are other reasons that people could be around the opposite sex other than an affair..", "Yeah idk man if it was me i would have told that brother to fuck off forever ago.... Eating dinner with someone that doesnt respect you or your wife is kind of an asshole move to yourself", "Well then maybe now he'll get the idea that it's neither in the past nor just a bunch of harmless pranks. I still think both of you are TA though (your brother for obvious reasons, and you for the nuclear escalation and the collateral damage), but that doesn't mean your actions weren't justified. It's probably going to take a long time, but I hope you and your brother and your families can heal from this.", "I just feel that it could have been handled differently is all. But I understand where you\u2019re coming from.", "I agree to a certain extent with you.. but he did hurt the brothers wife by doing this in front of her. She was blindsided. That\u2019s very hurtful. But we can agree to disagree", "This is some real fap material for you, eh? Do you get a wank everytime you post the same comment?", "No I didn't have all the pictures in my bag though I see where some one could mistake that. No I really just had them on my phone and only a couple printed out already zoomed in so I could prove I wasn't lying. My first reaction was to discuss it with her and only her privately but everything spilt out.", "\"Sure I'll respect you and your wife.\"  But then doesn't and then OP becomes the bad guy for trying to negotiate a way for brother to keep the secret for longer.  Basically complicit and willing to blackmail.  And gives brother an opportunity to come up with a lie to explain the evidence.", "Yeah because that guy seems like a real stand up guy.  Not misogynistic or disrespectful at all.\n\n(dripping with sarcasm)", "> I did see them kissing and no it wasn't a peck on the cheek it was full blown making out.\n\nA comment from OP", "You are right that his wife has been hurt.. But Just bcoz OP told her doesn't mean he's TA.. We are talking abt OP .. We need more clarity from his brothers POV", "you said you threw the pictures on the table. so you printed pictures and were carrying them around in your bag just waiting for the moment, and your bag was at the dinner table? this just makes no sense", "Tbh if it was me i just would cut off that brother... If he's calling my wife a whore i'm an asshole for even entertaining his company.... So yeah they're all aholes in my book.... Doing it over dinner in front of kids is a dick move too... Brother is biggest ahole but to say this situation could be handled better is to put it lightly imo....", "The literal only thing you know about the guy is this posters very biased and unverifiable depiction of him lol a guy that PRINTED photos off his phone for premeditated embarrassment and is telling people in the comments that he planned on doing it privately lol", "I only brought my bag with me instead of leaving it with my coat so I could show my sister in law the photos. Some of the pictures you needed to zoom into so I printed the ones you needed to zoom into.", "I do agree that OP should have bowed out of these family dinners long ago if OP was made to be whipping boy for all these years with the family enabling the brother.\n\nI know I wouldn't go to a regular dinner with someone who constantly wanted to bring me down.  And I wonder if this is the first time brother aimed his vitriol at OP's wife.  I sure hope so or OP is an AH for dragging his wife along for this type of abuse.", "I printed the ones you needed to zoom into. It wasn't for embarrassment, it was for my sister in law.", "The way OP's brother spoke about OP's wife spoke volumes about the guy.", "They're all aholes like i said man..... Because of this whole situation... Shouldn't have ever happened like it did or at all.. disagree if you want.. Just saying i'd have cut the guy off not doing that is being an ahole to yourself.. I guess teh only one who isnt an ahole is the wives.. happy now?", "I sincerely doubt she appreciated their dirty laundry being exposed to everyone like that", "You can zoom in on phones my guy. You went out of your way to premeditate your childhood revenge lol", "Idk, I think OP may have some trauma issues and has been conditioned all through his life to take brother's abuse.  I won't be so quick to blame him for having the misguided notion that family time is still important despite it being torture for him.\n\nI hope OP has a wake up call and can start the healing process while going NC with brother and LC with the parents if they're gonna keep siding with the AH brother.\n\nFor OP, the AH treatment from his brother is the norm. Been happening his whole life.  It takes some people a ridiculously long time to realize they don't have to put up with that crap.  I don't fully understand it but I try to be compassionate about it.  My husband had a similar situation with his family.  He was so used to being their punching bag he couldn't see just how screwed up they are.  I've tried opening his eyes to it, and due to their most recent antics, I think I may have finally gotten through to him, but I'm not 100% sure about that.  So I feel for people like OP who spent their life being bullied by a family member and being conditioned to believe it's normal or shouldn't be taken too seriously.", "I guess your reaction to my opinion which is justified was a bit ovvereeacting for a reddit comment tho", "Maybe your reaction to my response was the overreaction."]}
