Definitely NTA but he is and he needs help. He has an addiction. It's not my place to tell you what to do with your marriage but your husband needs help beyond what you can give him.", "NTA. You were completely right and your parents are showing extremely poor judgment.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but your husband is an addict.

He's an idiot, and should probably seek therapy for the gambling issues.", "NTA.  He needs a wake up call. This isn\u2019t having fun, this is having an addiction.

You did your best to contact him and even gave him a warning. If he hadn't been ignoring you to go feed his addiction, he'd have seen it. Your childrens' wellbeing and upkeep comes before anything. If he doesn't understand that, he doesn't need to be part of their lives until he can put them first.", "NTA. You stuck to your boundaries, period. With addicts, if you flip flop, they make an inch stretch a mile and keep going, which I suspect you have already learned. Now you need to do what is best for you and your children.", "NTA. Like countless AITAs, he is merely coming to terms of the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. Clearly he cares more about his addiction more than your family - and you need to put your children and yourself first. Who knows what could have happened when he got home - would he have been sober? Would, due to the feelings of shame from likely spending and losing all of the loan money, he have been aggressive when you guys inevitably fought? You were acting in the way you thought was best for your family. Try to get him help, but also take care of yourself.", "Nta at all. He has an addiction and HE has to take steps for it before he financially ruins you and your family.", "NTA and your parents' reaction kinda tells me how you chose this dude in the first place.  Your own parents didn't put you and their grandchildren first, they put a schmuck that spent money he didn't have to spend and essentially was fine with destroying his family, first.  So in the choosing, you didn't put yourself first, but somehow in this mess, you see it's wrong to NOT call it like you see it, which gives me hope for your future.    \n\n\nIt's not wise to be financially tied and liable for your husband's debts.", "NTA the question is how much longer you are willing to put up with this and how much more of your financial security are you willing to sacrifice? \n\nYou deserve a better life with a trustworthy partner.

You do not have to take part in that. Your family is shitty for being unsupportive right now.", "NTA - He\u2019s gambling with the money you need to support your kids. I don\u2019t blame you for removing yourself and the kids from this situation until he gets his priorities back in line and gets help for his gambling addiction.", "Time to lawyer up and then open your own account to transfer the money to so he doesn\u2019t have access to the bill money.

But you really should keep the fighting and issues between the two of you and try not to expose the young kids to any of it, since it\u2019s not good for their development. You dragged the kids into it by taking them away with you", "NTA but why are you using the kids against your husband? Taking the kids and leaving over something like this is crazy.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nHe's broken your trust in a massive way and now that he's done it once he's not going to stop.\n\nLeave now. Permanently. He's going to destroy himself and take you and your children with him.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't see this getting better, you need to divorce him. You don't necessarily have to stop living as a family if you can make it work, but you absolutely need to separate your finances and you cannot do that married.", "NTA. I would consider leaving him. My best friend's dad had a gambling problem and lost their house because of it. One time he went to Canada and lost everything and they had to GO PICK HIM UP. We're from the east coast of America. This is your future. Your parents are fools.", "NTA for taking care of your kids\n\nYour husband may need to consider therapy for a gambling addiction", "NTA at all. My mother didn't approve either when I called my gambling spouse an idiot without the f in front.", "NTA. Addiction sucks, A LOT, but that doesn't mean you should enable him.\nI hope he gets the help he needs.", "NTA. He's going to ruin you both financially if you don't break it off. He is completely out of control which means your family finances are entirely at risk.", "Nta it might be best to not go back if possible", "Or just stay gone. He can\u2019t hold himself to the rules he suggested. You can\u2019t sacrifice your kids\u2019 stability trying to handle his addiction (and yes, it *is* an addiction).", "NTA - I have gambling addiction in my family, I\u2019ve seen how terrible it can ruin lives and the wealthiest family who owned million+ mansion now living in their brothers rental unit\u2026. It\u2019s so sad. My aunts husband gambled everything away, and she\u2019s 70 and still working because they have nothing. Omg it\u2019s making me cry right now. She\u2019s in full depression. And he still, is gambling. He can\u2019t stop. Pls protect yourself.", "What she did here is really not good either. Her children are getting caught in the collateral damage of their fight. According to all psychological reports on early development, children who are exposed to destructive conflicts such as this often experience higher levels of distress, anxiety and aggressive later on in live. Walking out of the home with your kids is known as a silent tactic, but the kids are going to wonder why their mom is taking them away and they\u2019re not sleeping in their own beds tonight. And it will disrupt the key stability that young kids so desperately need. There was no reason whatsoever she couldn\u2019t have waited until the morning to address the fight, and then give the kids a notice in advance that they would be staying somewhere else and added a white lie to it. If she keeps exposing her children to hostile conflicts and new environments on a whim like this, they will deal with the psychological ramifications for the rest of their life. Preschool aged kids are the ones who are the most affected by these early memories and experiences", "If her children\u2019s well-being and upkeep comes before anything, then she probably didn\u2019t do the right thing. Even if they needed to separate, it\u2019s probably not the healthiest thing to spring this on your kids so late at night. It might not be so bad for a 1 or 2 year old, but if they\u2019re in like preschool and are just starting to understand the world and form their earliest foundational memories, being dragged off at 10pm and not knowing why isn\u2019t great. She could have told them in the morning that they\u2019ll be staying at their aunt and uncles house tonight or in a few days and made up a white lie. He is an addict with a problem. But you could even say being supportive of him getting help is better than insulting him and berating him as well", "Both of my parents are also addicts. One to gambling, one to drugs. The one addicted to gambling is the one who was with my husband at the casino.", "They\u2019re both also addicts. One to gambling and one to drugs.", "So she should\u2019ve what?  Left the alone? Absolutely she needed to bring them with her when leaving.", "I don\u2019t see it as using the kids against him, nor was that my intent. I could not stand the thought of him coming home and climbing into bed with me like nothing is wrong OR him waking me up to start with the \u201coh I wanted to leave at X time but Y friend wasn\u2019t ready\u201d \u201cthey told me they\u2019d give me $20 to drive them and I could only spend my Freeplay.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to fight and I didn\u2019t want to be near him. Same spiel every time this has happened. And if I left, I couldn\u2019t just leave the kids there. I sent him the photo so he would know they were safe and having fun and where we were. \n\nThis might be trivial to you, but it is not to me.", "Yeah, she should have definitely dropped them off at the casino to stay with their dad /s. Wtf. Just because you have no standards and would allow this kind of stuff", "There was no conflict happening. The kids knew they were going to have a sleepover with their cousin. Quite excited about it really. Well, my oldest was and still is. My youngest doesn\u2019t really know his ass from his elbow yet.", "They are going to suffer more trauma if they grow up with a gambling addict.", "When people are that angry, it's not a good idea to stick around. I imagine they would have started arguing the moment he got home at 3am and woken the children to screaming if she'd stayed. I believe she made the right call. With them being so little, she probably told them they were just going to visit, they got to stay up late and didn't think anything else of it.\n\nWith addicts, you can only be so supportive. If they aren't ready to get help and admit they have a problem, nothing can be done. Enabling is not being supportive.", "Yikes. I would be livid at them if it were me.", "It sounds like you have managed to attract someone like them. I'm sorry. I hope you get the resources needed to heal and move on. Based on history, you should realize you can't save him, but you can save your children from being exposed to that type of environment.", "Protect yourself and  your kids at all costs. Do as the other commenter recommend and demand control over finances or segregate your funds from his so he cant get to your money and he get therapy.\n\nDo you both work or is he main bread winner?", "There was no reason for her to even leave at all.  He wasn't even there.", "If she needed to separate from him, then she should\u2019ve told the kids in the morning something like \u201cwe\u2019re going to go to your aunt and uncles house for a few days, but daddy will be staying here\u201d. How are you supposed to explain to them why they\u2019re leaving at 10pm to stay at a random person\u2019s house? I imagine it would be pretty confusing and scary for a young child. You should maintain a United front for your kids sake. I don\u2019t blame her for berating him and I think he deserved it, but you could also say insulting an addict is unproductive and won\u2019t help them change. Although she made no mention of him being verbally or physically abusive, so why she needs to separate is a little unclear", "Be careful because they\u2019re sponges. Sure, it might be fine to do this now. But when it\u2019s 10pm, and he wants to have a sleepover at his friends house or some place, and you tell him no, the rules are going to seem arbitrary. He\u2019ll ask why he got to do it before. He\u2019ll be met with lies and no explanation. It\u2019s not ideal to have inconsistency and separation", "You can be furious at your partner, but you can still avoid screaming at them in the presence of your kids. If it\u2019s really that bad, it might be a good time to drop them off at their grandparents or something, and then have the argument and decide if you need to separate from them for awhile", "I\u2019m already very low contact with both of them. They suck", "He works, I\u2019m a stay at home mom and homeschool our oldest. I planned on going back to work when we were done with breastfeeding (so a few more months) but it looks like it\u2019ll have to happen sooner.", "She left to avoid the conflict when he came home and climbed into bed next to her after blowing THEIR BILL MONEY at the casino. Would you rather she stay and the kids hear them fighting when he got home at 2 am?!?", "Except she had no idea when or how he would come home. Being with family and away from him makes absolute sense to me.", "Nah, good call to leave then. And no, kids do not need a united front in instances like this. That for rules that affect the kids etc, not to make a couple stay together. I would agree IF she told her kids the names she called him and trashed him, but just leaving didn\u2019t damage them.", "When my kids were under 5, if I told them we were going to someone's house they would say okie dokie and get in the car.", "She can absolutely tell them no this was a special circumstance wtf are you talking about", "It's not ideal to be flat broke because your dad is blowing everything on gambling. Yes, conflict and separation of parents is bad for kids, but so is poverty.", "The kids are under 5 they aren\u2019t going to be requesting 10 pm sleepovers at their friends house for YEARS", "Sure. It\u2019s also not ideal to have your husband out acting afool either, so we\u2019re not really working within ideal circumstances right now", "I don't believe in people needing to stay and try to talk things out if it's been an ongoing issue. Talking about it again won't change anything. She'll talk at him, he won't listen, he'll agree never to do it again and be right back at it as soon as he can. This is how people end up stuck in abusive relationships and relationships with addicts. Getting away from them is the only thing that breaks the cycle.\n\nI was in an abusive relationship where my ex husband was an \"intimacy\" addict if you catch my drift. He came home at 3am with our toddler daughter barefoot, covered in grease and dirt with cigarette burns in her clothing. I packed up all our belongings, would have left at 4am if my car would have held everything and never saw him again because my daughter was more important than a crappy relationship with somebody I couldn't trust to be responsible enough to care for her because his addiction meant more to him than her. I feel OP's situation is similar and couldn't have been handled any differently. There's a point where enough is enough and you have to just *GO*.", "This bull shot your spewing about not leaving with the kids to avoid a conflict with an addict literally gets women and their children killed. If she feels the safest option for her mental state and her kids is to leave she needs to leave.", "If I was a 4 or 5 year old I would be really confused as to why it was happening and what was going on. I think it introduces a sense of instability to their concept of their home life and their parents relationship. Why did she need to leave, though? If my partner did something like that, I would maybe drop the kids off at their grandparents house and then have the heated argument with them after they\u2019re gone. Dragging them into it is just not very healthy", "Yeah, only that doesn\u2019t explain why, you\u2019re just telling them it was a special circumstance. That isn\u2019t an explanation. But it\u2019s not going to be this one time that this happens. There\u2019s no way this marriage works out now. Once you get to this stage in a marriage, without the immediate help of couples counseling, it\u2019s already doomed. At least statistically. A divorce now might very well be the better option for her. You can\u2019t just threaten to take someone\u2019s kids and leave them once you\u2019re married and expect things to bounce back like normal. A line has so self evidently been crossed here, and their relationship is going to be under turmoil and their kids are already likely to suffer from it", "You can always put your kids first. It sounds like he was doing better and relapsed. Of course, she can be mad. Maybe it would be no use to be supportive of him getting help and trying to work it out. But if separation becomes necessary in a marriage, then you know what, you might be better just setting up a child of divorce while they were in preschool. What she has done is akin to that already, for if she doesn\u2019t remedy it, they\u2019ll probably just suffer serious arrested development growing up being gaslit by their parents who are always fighting but not showing it", "Fair enough, although by leaving your partner and taking the kids out of their home you\u2019ve so hastily chosen the nuclear option here. You\u2019re setting up a path which so clearly heads towards more lies, conflicts and destruction for them and this relationship. There\u2019s a precedent set now where they no longer have a consistent routine and always sleep in the same house. You might be better apologizing to them, and then telling them the truth now. Because doing drastic stuff like this always collects its toll and has an affect on your kids", "Confusion sure. Permanent damage or being drug into things is not the same as confusion that could be explained simply or even with white lies. He came home at 3am with no contact. He could\u2019ve been dead for all anyone knew (thanks to cell phone tracking I guess). To me that\u2019s much more damaging then going to a family members house at 10.", "There was no reason for her to leave at all", "Mommy needed to not be at home daddy was struggling with something and he needed space. No lies. You keep telling her she shouldn\u2019t have left with the kids. completely ignoring the fact that statistically when dealing with domestic situations and addiction staying is literally how women and children end up in the most danger.", "Yeah I mean kids grow up with divorced parents all the time, and plenty of them even manage to be normal. Your heart's in the right place, but you're being kind of insane. Your perfectionist prescriptions aren't going to make a difference here.", "Well maybe. I think your perspective here is fair enough. I don\u2019t know how she handled it and what she told the kids, but I can imagine scenarios like this that really scare the kids or change their foundational understanding of their home life pretty easily. You really want them to sleep in the same bed in the same room and follow the same routine every night, and have 2 parents who both love them and never fight. Around the age of preschool and kindergarten when they start getting their earliest memories is a bad time for it especially", "A divorce would be better than the alternative, although that\u2019s pretty much the route she\u2019s going down. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s good for a preschooler to get divorced parents, and probably split homes, and the feeling of abandonment, and guilt which are common things children subsequently deal with after a divorce at a young age. But I mean, it\u2019s still better than the alternative if they\u2019re going to be exposed to what she\u2019s done now, regularly. And this marriage seems like it\u2019s already gutshot, I\u2019d say"]}
