This trip was for your bday not for her friend.  Her friend was the AH in the first place, and your mom was being passive....you do not invite yourself to trips, events, anything....you can drop hints that you'd like to go and see if the other people wants to invite you, but to down right ask is rude and puts a person into a position of feeling obligated whether they'd prefer to say no or not.", "NTA.\n\n\"Go along to get along\" is what people say when they know they're in the wrong but don't want to do anything about it.", "NTA OP \n\nThat friend of your mom's sucks, not only is an asshole but also has main character syndrome. Next time tell your mom if anyone else joins the trip that was intended for only the two of you, you won't be coming.\n\nOP stay away from this friend and ask your mom to maintain distance from her as well. She brings nothing but misery for both you and mom and also mom needs to stop being such a pushover.", "NTA\n\nYour mom and her friend are though.  Your mom's friend is for inviting herself then getting drunk, trying to social pressure you into doing the same and micromanaging.  Icing on the asshole cake her comment about her poor poor self - all that worrying about your mother.  What a ninny.  \n\n\nYour mom put you on the spot by accepting on your behalf and only asking you later if you were okay with it, that shows she honestly didn't give you any thought; it was very rude.", "Not the AH at all. Sorry your birthday got ruined.\n\nYour mum is the slight AH. She should have never said yes to this apparent friend. Wasnt like you were just going on a random trip, it was an important birthday and special mum/child time.\n\n\nClearly this person struggles with social cues or gives zero F###'s about other people, otherwise they'd never impose themselves on such a situation.\n\nYou are allowed to be upset and angry. Is there a reason your mum felt she couldn't say no?", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. The friend needed to hear it.", "NTA. \n\nJust because you are young doesn't mean you should put up with an endless stream of complaining and moaning from your mother's friend. She ruined your trip. \n\nBesides, what would getting along with her look like? Just more listening to her complaints probably. Not worth it, imho.", "Bit of an ESH situation, but you least of all imo. \n\nYour mom should not have agreed it without speaking to you in private. Sure she paid for it but it was an agreed birthday celebration and having one of her random friends there was definitely not what you wanted. On top of that said friend was rude and disrespectful the entire trip. \n\nDid you have a bit of a strop? Ye you did.

She had already invited the friend at that point and it may have seemed like that ship had sailed, but there was room for you to make your feelings known.

Your mom should've told said friend, that this was a special mother-daughter trip. That the two of them could go on their own trip together another time. \n\nBtw, doesn't matter that your mom paid for the trip...the trip was for YOUR bday and special time for the two of you. I would've told her that I just wanted it to be me and her, that you didn't want a third wheel.

You did try to \"get along\" by not expressing your feelings before the trip when you didn't even really want this person to go. Your mom totaly botched your big 2 1 by not thinking about how this should have been a special trip for you, not her \"friend\"", "NTA tell your mother, if she cares more about her friend being happy than you she can go on trips with her alone.
