We did it together.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have tried baking, I haven\u2019t done baking. You did everything! You should\u2019ve just bought a cake for me. My time is wasted for this, and should\u2019ve just studied for law school.\u201d\n\nI was so shocked. I felt unappreciated and was close to tears.

He's bad at communication and out of touch with his own emotions. He will continue to lash out.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. You had a thoughtful and fun date idea to celebrate your boyfriend's birthday, and you even paid for the cake yourself. It's understandable that you were hurt and confused by your boyfriend's sudden outburst and refusal to finish the cake with you. You tried to talk to him calmly and even offered to let him finish decorating the cake, but he still chose to leave and be rude to you over a simple baking mishap\n\nNta", "ESH. Neither one of you seems willing/able to communicate with one another.\n\nYou seem controlling and likely did suck any fun out of the activity. \n\nHe acted childishly by stomping off and leaving.\n\nEither communicate with one another or just break up cause this isn't working.", "It seems to me like you were too invested in the cake turning out well, and you didn't want to let him just do things his way when he was trying to fix the icing he made.  If I were him, my feelings would be hurt because it was my birthday, and I would have expected my partner to be patient with me on my birthday.\n\nJust my 2 cents, I see a lot of disagreement.", "ESH. Sounds like you had a clear idea of what to make and how to make it. For him it was supposed to be fun but he didn't get to enjoy the experience because you were too focused on the outcome. If he sucks at baking you should have just allowed him to make a shitty cake. He shouldn't be so dramatic and could have just been honest that he didn't enjoy it. I don't like how he communicated the message but I get why he was upset with you.", "NTA. You wanted to do something genuinely nice for him and instead of admitting that he made a mistake, he basically made it your fault. Him not wanting to talk to you was also very immature. You deserve better than him.", "A kind ESH. \n\nThe date idea was super cute, but the point of it is that you do it together, or at best you help *him* do it, but it sounds like you took over and he mostly just watched you doing it, which defeats the point of going to this date to make it together. The one thing he got to do, you did it over because it wasn't good. The gift is paying for the ingredients and the experience, and if the cake is kinda messed up, its fine because you had fun together. Laugh about it and eat it anyway.\n\nBut I do think he's massively overreacting. He's completely blown up about it. I'm *guessing* he's been stressed with law school, so he was looking forward to actually *doing* something and not just watching someone do something, but he can't handle issues like this, that wasn't fair on you.", "NTA. I think you're focused a little too much on the gift aspect of it all, but it was a cute date idea. You could have tried to involve him a little more, but he also could have shown some interest, even if he didn't really wanna be there. Or at least he could have communicated that he wasn't having a great time so you could work on it together. \n\nHe sounds immature though. His reaction was over the top and childish.", "ESH - you\u2019re TA for being controlling.  He\u2019s TA for being a child.  Sounds like you\u2019re both terrible with communication and both have unrealistic expectations.  This relationship\u2019s foundation doesn\u2019t seem to be one based on compassion and love.  I\u2019d probably move on.", "NTA even if he is stressed out, even if he felt emasculated, even if he was sorry he was there, acting insulting and immature in public is tacky.  Only a month into this relationship and such a good lesson learned!", "NTA, but this dude is toxic. Instead of communicating his emotions or desires he just shuts down/explodes. Trust me when I say unless he realizes the behavior, it ain\u2019t gonna get better", "YTA, you did all the fun work and this date was not actually about him", "I'm going to say ... NTA because I genuinely do not understand what his anger stems from, but that could be  a failing in your telling to us and not in his telling to you.  \n\nIs he angry that you made him work for his birthday present, or is he angry that you did all the work for his birthday present?  \n\nI don't know know what his issue is, but the fact of it seems to be, he did not enjoy the date, and rather than just chalking this up to \"I don't really enjoy this guy's company to do pointless activities with him and enjoy the experience\" he's decided to cause a conflict to give him an excuse to break up without it being about him just not liking you.\n\nHe's really not into you.  That's the bottom line.  When you really like someone and you're in the initial stages of dating, the most trivial pointless shit is breathless and fun.  \n\nThis ain't that. \n\nHe's a slight asshole for not being grown up enough to break up without making a drama. \n\nNTA", "I don't really think you're the asshole here.  \nEven though you wrote the situation in detail I think there's a lot of nuance that can't be understood without being there like what the last couple of days were like in terms of college stress, the overall chemistry between you, the tone of voice when you offered to fix the cake.  \n\n\nThose things can play a part in how you two ended up in this conflict. But from what I can read, it seems like he was probably frustrated in not knowing how to bake and felt like you were doing so much that he felt guilty and therefore defensive, which boiled him until he unfairly snapped.

If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday.

Just a lovers' quarrel.\n\nIt sounds like he felt you were too bossy in the cake baking session. You seem to know a lot about baking, and he might not, so he felt a little intimidated.\n\nAfter that, he had some sore feelings about it, so he began to criticize every aspect of it that bothered him in the slightest.

He easily gets annoyed.\n3) Seems he wants to be the star.

I'm sure. If he acted this way in that scenario which could have not escalated but he chose to be too dramatic, he will for surely do it again in the future and guilt trip you.

Do not let other people belittle you or make petty fights with you. It was so thoughtful of you to do that for him but he acted way out of line.\n\nI know you were trying to help him, OP but you could have also let him do the ugly icing. even if the cake turns out ugly, he knows it was on him.

As a date, it\u2019s important to spend quality time together \u2014 was there a good opportunity for this? As an experience, did he do much of the baking? And as a gift you were giving him the cake to take with him, but unless he really likes cake, birthday cake is more special shared. And if it\u2019s just a gift, rather than also working as a date and experience, then it did take a lot of time (and he\u2019s stressed out about studying). Also the one thing he tried to do turned out to be wrong (both in not working out, and in being something you weren\u2019t supposed to do according to the business).\n\nHe probably really needed that break, but if he wasn\u2019t really involved in the experience, or interacting with you as a date, then he would find it a waste of his time.", "NTA\n\nOne month and he behaves like this?

I think this was a cute idea for a date that turned out to be a bust. Baking together is actually not easy to do, and especially if one person is experienced and the other isn\u2019t. You\u2019re either taking turns doing steps, which gets awkward, or one person is watching the other. It\u2019s not like you can both operate the mixer. \n\nAnd when you are experienced and see the other making mistakes - it\u2019s not the easiest thing to respond to without either being controlling or condescending. Your other option is letting the project come out badly, as baking is not forgiving of mistakes, which can also go poorly in the end depending on the people involved. \n\nFor me, this was my experience trying to bake with my son when he was little. And because he was a child, he would sometimes feel sad if the end product wasn\u2019t good, so really it was not a great parent-child activity for us. Obviously other parents totally rock this; but I, like you, am not good at navigating that line. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Your date behaved like my son, but he is not a child. He just acted like one. This was a crappy date, but his reaction was ridiculous and outsized. I\u2019d be wary of whether this is how he handles things that don\u2019t go his way.

But, it seems like OP was more concerned about having a perfect cake than a fun date.", ">Then hovering and interfering when he tried to apply the icing, immediately jumping in to 'fix it' for him. If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday. It was meant to be about having fun together and making him happy on his birthday, instead you made him feel shit about himself because you can do everything better and his way of making the cake was clearly not ok. It doesn't matter that you put on a calm, happy voice. This probably made it even more patronising.\n\n100% on point.

I would love it even if I'm not that much into baking at home. You have all the ingredients, and tools and you don't even need to clean everything at the end! Plus you get cake, it sounds perfect to me.\n\nNot that my opinion or yours matter, but anyway OP says the friend mentioned wanting to try the experience and everything was planned, so I don't really see the issue.", "Sure, but someone who isn\u2019t in the third grade uses words to communicate their intended meaning.

Seems like bf maybe didn't want to be there to me, since he didn't really participate. And the icing was lumpy. He nicely offered to try to fix it. The bf is the only AH here.", "Agree. Also, not everyone enjoys baking, and not everyone wants to be given a task that they have to execute properly in order for it to turn out as a \"gift.\" Especially if he is stressed about law school or is already a perfectionist type. If he's never tried baking before, it's possible that it's because it's not something he cares about doing. The BF definitely could have handled his embarrassment or dislike of the activity better, or communicated to OP more that he was nervous about making mistakes and wants guidance but not someone to do it for him, etc. \n\nHOWEVER, OP seems not self-aware and unable to comprehend how this \"gift\" of a skilled task that BF has never tried to do before may actually feel more like a stressor than anything. And that's before the fact that OP actually ended up doing it all himself, which literally takes whatever bit of fun out of it for BF and is the icing on the embarrassment cake (pun intended).\n\nOP, please take this as a lesson in giving people gifts. You seemed to pick this gift for your BF because it's something YOU already like and enjoy (baking). It's generally better to pick gifts for the people to enjoy, and sometimes that takes the ability to swallow your pride on what YOU would rather do, in order to give them what they would like for their gift. Just because OP likes baking and decided it would be fun together as a \"gift\" doesn't mean BF has to like it too. But BF needs to work on communication, too.\n\nEditing to add: You guys have not been dating long at all. Some people, myself included, do not like doing \"new\" things or having to learn in real-time when we are around others who we are not 100% comfortable with yet. Granted, I have ADHD and am autistic, but I know neurotypical people like this, too. It's not necessarily always an ego thing of not wanting to look stupid around others, although it can be. For me, it's more that new situations and places can be stressful, and learning new skills can be stressful, so the idea of having to perform/learn a new skill in a new place is quite overwhelming. I'd go with my partner, who I've been dating for quite a long time. But I definitely would have recommended a different date spot during the first few months of our relationship! At this point, your relationship is still very fresh, and he probably isn't fully comfortable yet, so it's harder to let his guard down to be silly or make mistakes without worrying.", "If that was the case then the boyfriend should have communicated with him, instead of childishly leaving.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like OP was that overbearing, he might have tried too hard to make it perfect because it was at gift, but even if he was being anal about it the solution isn't to leave like that and hurt the other person, the whole \"I should have stayed home and studied\" was needlessly cruel.", ">I feel like the purpose here was to engage in an activity together, but OP would rather have the boyfriend sit and watch him bake a cake for him. That's hardly amusing.\n\nOn top of that, I get the feeling that boyfriend wasn\u2019t super interested in baking a cake in the first place. OP thought it would be a cute idea but didn\u2019t take into consideration if it was actually how boyfriend wanted to celebrate his birthday.", "I read it more as \u201cI went to do the batter and he instead of following and helping, decided to sit down at the workplace and not do anything\u201d.

He would have preferred getting the cake and sharing it with you, while spending time together just talking or chilling or.. whatever new dates might do. You had the best intentions though so NTA. He should have told you sooner in the process that he wasn\u2019t into it, but then - you already paid and the day would have been spoiled anyway. Having dated only a month I can understand why he tried to give it a shot. But in general he hopefully would speak up. He\u2019s not really an AH either, but between the two of you, he\u2019s more so.                      \nAnyway. I still think you two are not a great match.

It should not matter who makes the ridiculous batter, and it's also his own fault that he messed up the icing. Omg.\n\nA word of advice, maybe don't date that guy.

He may be incredibly smart and make a great lawyer one day, but he seems to have the emotional intelligence of a badger.\n\nI'd keep track of how often he makes you feel this way.

Not awful.", "I\u2019d say both are TA..\n\nOP mixed the batter, made the icing- when the gift was doing this- the BF should\u2019ve been doing most of the legwork and maybe talked through the process by OP\n\nBF mixed some icing, and did it poorly, and possibly in frustration of his little part in the cake making, lashes out verbally..\nBF should be able to control things better, and be able to talk things through.\n\nBut OP didn\u2019t have much regard for what BF was wanting to do, or let him enjoy HIS gift, without taking over.", "NTA\n\nPlease tell me you\u2019re not giving this asshole a second date.", "These types of creative dates are risky because everyone's going to feel great if it turns out good, but if you go there with the mentality that it has to turn out perfect/a certain way then you're going to feel bad when it doesn't meet your expectations.\n\nI feel like these types of \"failures\" aka overwhipping the icing (which is more of a mistake if anything else) shouldn't be taken seriously. It sounds like when you told him \"let me try fixing it\" he thought that you were criticizing him for it and thus reacted the way he did.\n\nPersonally I'm going with NTA (would have even gone with NAH if he hadn't gotten up and left like that, but instead had been honest about his feelings), but would recommend you don't go with high expectations to those kind of places, because you're definitely going to be disappointed by mistakes, teamwork is going to be bad and you won't have fun with your partner that way. It's even worse when one of the people is a complete beginner who's already stressed from studies or workload, the disappointment is going to be greater.\n\nCouples that go there for more chill dates tend to have more fun and laugh such mistakes off.

I would reconsider dating this guy. \n\nHe just seems like the kind of person that could honestly escalate to abuse when he feels ashamed or embarrassed.\n\nETA ESH I misread the post originally and i thought bf tried to fix the icing and then left. Yeah op taking over the icing was a mistake and also if you made any of those comments about the icing being overwhelmed then you sick too. Doing something like making a cake is supposed to be fun and it can be messed up if you want. I have q hobby of making decorated royal icing cookies and I\u2019m pretty dang good but when i make them with kids and my husband joins in we all just do whatever and laugh at the silly cookies.

OP was more focused on the cake than he was on his boyfriend\u2019s happiness. I don\u2019t think it was malicious and I don\u2019t think OP meant to make his date feel useless, but I definitely think that is what happened and OP is just oblivious to it, maybe out of good intentions of wanting the cake to be a perfect gift.\n\nI do think the boyfriend communicated a bit immaturely, but I know I\u2019m far from the most level headed when I\u2019m upset.

He's showing who he is. I agree he can grow, but that's not something the OP should risk at this point.

If he'd let him do the icing himself without hovering and worrying and then stepping in.

All I felt reading this was how high pressure and uncomfortable and not at all fun a date like this would be for me. \n\nI'm not saying everyone would agree but if you aren't sure the person you're dating would enjoy this, it's a lot to put on them. \n\nAn activity you don't like that requires skills is a really grim early date idea.

A painter can paint in their own house, a baker can bake a cake in his own house probably getting a better price for ingredients.\n\nThese kinds of dates are also not meant for people that can't handle making mistakes. It's meant for those that are good sports and can laugh at themselves and enjoy doing an activity with their partner. If there was a mistake here, maybe it was picking a date activity where there was a big difference in skill - and maybe the timing of the date (near exam time) didn't help. But I think OP chose something that he thought would be fun.\n\nAccusations elsewhere in the thread that OP is being dishonest and that he \"did it all\" I think are not fair either. Baking a cake doesn't take two people. They also had a stand mixer. The steps of cake baking are weigh ingredients, mix, make icing, apply icing. They both weighed, OP put ingredients in the mixer (this is not a 2 person job), OP's date made the icing. OP's date started putting the icing on, OP finished. I don't get that OP did everything.\n\nTo be charitable, I think OP's date was embarrassed he screwed up the icing and was additionally stressed about exams.

Got some funny patterns on them from it with the logo there. \n\nAmazing how versatile glasses can be when you need them to be. \n\nHonestly though I think the memory of it is far more fun than having everything go perfectly. The memory with your ex sounds fun too! I know it'd make me laugh and be a fun story to tell when I bake something else."]}
