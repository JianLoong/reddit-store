I let him choose a cake, I paid it myself, and we were even given some freebies to play at the crane machine.\n\nI have to tell what happened in detail since it is important later.\n\nFirst off, we both measured and gathered the ingredients.

As for me, I also sat because the recipe said to mix for 8 minutes.\n\nAfter batter was ready, we put in the molds.\n\nHere comes icing. I did the icing. But he wanted to do an hombre effect to the cake, so he also made a strawberry flavored icing. So now we have to. I was kinda nervous at first because the attendants initially said that ingredients that are not part of the recipe will be an additional charge. Thankfully, he was not caught, and wth it is his cake after all. Problem is, it is his first time, and he overwhipped his icing.\n\nWhen we were done, we had some down time. We need to wait for the cakes to finish cooling. When they were done and when it is time to assemble, he did his icing first. As expected, the icing was clumpy and was like butter and was not sticking to the cake. He tried fixing it, and it seemed to get worse. So I said calmly, \u201cLet me try fixing it.\u201d\n\nAll of sudden he disappeared. I noticed him at a table, approached him, and told him \u201cLet\u2019s finish the cake!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish the cake?! You\u2019re doing all the work.\u201d\n\nI was confused.\n\n\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry if you feel that way, you could\u2019ve told me earlier if you feel that way, so why not you finish icing and decorating?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d\n\nHe stood up. Left. And messaged me, and this is our convo:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? It\u2019s your cake. This is yours.\u201d\n\u201cBring it home then.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is yours.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Did I make it?\u201d (At this point I\u2019m like - well this is my gift to you)\n\u201cWe did. We did it together.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have tried baking, I haven\u2019t done baking. You did everything! You should\u2019ve just bought a cake for me. My time is wasted for this, and should\u2019ve just studied for law school.\u201d\n\nI was so shocked. I felt unappreciated and was close to tears. It is a gift after all.\n\nAs I don\u2019t want to escalate things further I just said sorry a bunch of times and begged for him to come back. He came back, but forced me to finish decorating the cake when I waited for him to come back so he can do it.\n\nAfter everything was done, I brought him to the train station, with him not talking to me all throughout, and just took the cake without saying goodbye.\n\nHere I am, wondering - AITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1681651219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o89s5/aita_for_giving_a_cake_to_my_date/", "score": 956, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's bad at communication and out of touch with his own emotions. He will continue to lash out.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. You had a thoughtful and fun date idea to celebrate your boyfriend's birthday, and you even paid for the cake yourself. It's understandable that you were hurt and confused by your boyfriend's sudden outburst and refusal to finish the cake with you. You tried to talk to him calmly and even offered to let him finish decorating the cake, but he still chose to leave and be rude to you over a simple baking mishap\n\nNta", "ESH. Neither one of you seems willing/able to communicate with one another.\n\nYou seem controlling and likely did suck any fun out of the activity. \n\nHe acted childishly by stomping off and leaving.\n\nEither communicate with one another or just break up cause this isn't working.", "It seems to me like you were too invested in the cake turning out well, and you didn't want to let him just do things his way when he was trying to fix the icing he made.  If I were him, my feelings would be hurt because it was my birthday, and I would have expected my partner to be patient with me on my birthday.\n\nJust my 2 cents, I see a lot of disagreement.", "ESH. Sounds like you had a clear idea of what to make and how to make it. For him it was supposed to be fun but he didn't get to enjoy the experience because you were too focused on the outcome. If he sucks at baking you should have just allowed him to make a shitty cake. He shouldn't be so dramatic and could have just been honest that he didn't enjoy it. I don't like how he communicated the message but I get why he was upset with you.", "NTA. You wanted to do something genuinely nice for him and instead of admitting that he made a mistake, he basically made it your fault. Him not wanting to talk to you was also very immature. You deserve better than him.", "A kind ESH. \n\nThe date idea was super cute, but the point of it is that you do it together, or at best you help *him* do it, but it sounds like you took over and he mostly just watched you doing it, which defeats the point of going to this date to make it together. The one thing he got to do, you did it over because it wasn't good. The gift is paying for the ingredients and the experience, and if the cake is kinda messed up, its fine because you had fun together. Laugh about it and eat it anyway.\n\nBut I do think he's massively overreacting. He's completely blown up about it. I'm *guessing* he's been stressed with law school, so he was looking forward to actually *doing* something and not just watching someone do something, but he can't handle issues like this, that wasn't fair on you.", "NTA. I think you're focused a little too much on the gift aspect of it all, but it was a cute date idea. You could have tried to involve him a little more, but he also could have shown some interest, even if he didn't really wanna be there. Or at least he could have communicated that he wasn't having a great time so you could work on it together. \n\nHe sounds immature though. His reaction was over the top and childish.", "ESH - you\u2019re TA for being controlling.  He\u2019s TA for being a child.  Sounds like you\u2019re both terrible with communication and both have unrealistic expectations.  This relationship\u2019s foundation doesn\u2019t seem to be one based on compassion and love.  I\u2019d probably move on.", "NTA even if he is stressed out, even if he felt emasculated, even if he was sorry he was there, acting insulting and immature in public is tacky.  Only a month into this relationship and such a good lesson learned!", "NTA, but this dude is toxic. Instead of communicating his emotions or desires he just shuts down/explodes. Trust me when I say unless he realizes the behavior, it ain\u2019t gonna get better", "YTA, you did all the fun work and this date was not actually about him", "I'm going to say ... NTA because I genuinely do not understand what his anger stems from, but that could be  a failing in your telling to us and not in his telling to you.  \n\nIs he angry that you made him work for his birthday present, or is he angry that you did all the work for his birthday present?  \n\nI don't know know what his issue is, but the fact of it seems to be, he did not enjoy the date, and rather than just chalking this up to \"I don't really enjoy this guy's company to do pointless activities with him and enjoy the experience\" he's decided to cause a conflict to give him an excuse to break up without it being about him just not liking you.\n\nHe's really not into you.  That's the bottom line.  When you really like someone and you're in the initial stages of dating, the most trivial pointless shit is breathless and fun.  \n\nThis ain't that. \n\nHe's a slight asshole for not being grown up enough to break up without making a drama. \n\nNTA", "I don't really think you're the asshole here.  \nEven though you wrote the situation in detail I think there's a lot of nuance that can't be understood without being there like what the last couple of days were like in terms of college stress, the overall chemistry between you, the tone of voice when you offered to fix the cake.  \n\n\nThose things can play a part in how you two ended up in this conflict. But from what I can read, it seems like he was probably frustrated in not knowing how to bake and felt like you were doing so much that he felt guilty and therefore defensive, which boiled him until he unfairly snapped.

If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday. It was meant to be about having fun together and making him happy on his birthday, instead you made him feel shit about himself because you can do everything better and his way of making the cake was clearly not ok.

Just a lovers' quarrel.\n\nIt sounds like he felt you were too bossy in the cake baking session. You seem to know a lot about baking, and he might not, so he felt a little intimidated.\n\nAfter that, he had some sore feelings about it, so he began to criticize every aspect of it that bothered him in the slightest. For example, his time is scarce, and it did take extra time vs. just buying a cake. That might have hurt you because you inferred that he thought time spent with you wasn't worthwhile.

He easily gets annoyed.\n3) Seems he wants to be the star.

I'm sure. If he acted this way in that scenario which could have not escalated but he chose to be too dramatic, he will for surely do it again in the future and guilt trip you.

Do not let other people belittle you or make petty fights with you. It was so thoughtful of you to do that for him but he acted way out of line.\n\nI know you were trying to help him, OP but you could have also let him do the ugly icing. even if the cake turns out ugly, he knows it was on him.

I also notice you didn\u2019t say much about how you interacted other than the cake stuff. So it\u2019s three things: a date, an experience, and a gift. As a date, it\u2019s important to spend quality time together \u2014 was there a good opportunity for this? As an experience, did he do much of the baking? And as a gift you were giving him the cake to take with him, but unless he really likes cake, birthday cake is more special shared. And if it\u2019s just a gift, rather than also working as a date and experience, then it did take a lot of time (and he\u2019s stressed out about studying). Also the one thing he tried to do turned out to be wrong (both in not working out, and in being something you weren\u2019t supposed to do according to the business).\n\nHe probably really needed that break, but if he wasn\u2019t really involved in the experience, or interacting with you as a date, then he would find it a waste of his time.", "NTA\n\nOne month and he behaves like this?

I think this was a cute idea for a date that turned out to be a bust. Baking together is actually not easy to do, and especially if one person is experienced and the other isn\u2019t. You\u2019re either taking turns doing steps, which gets awkward, or one person is watching the other. It\u2019s not like you can both operate the mixer. \n\nAnd when you are experienced and see the other making mistakes - it\u2019s not the easiest thing to respond to without either being controlling or condescending. Your other option is letting the project come out badly, as baking is not forgiving of mistakes, which can also go poorly in the end depending on the people involved. \n\nFor me, this was my experience trying to bake with my son when he was little. And because he was a child, he would sometimes feel sad if the end product wasn\u2019t good, so really it was not a great parent-child activity for us. Obviously other parents totally rock this; but I, like you, am not good at navigating that line. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Your date behaved like my son, but he is not a child. He just acted like one. This was a crappy date, but his reaction was ridiculous and outsized. I\u2019d be wary of whether this is how he handles things that don\u2019t go his way.

But, it seems like OP was more concerned about having a perfect cake than a fun date.", ">Then hovering and interfering when he tried to apply the icing, immediately jumping in to 'fix it' for him. If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday. It was meant to be about having fun together and making him happy on his birthday, instead you made him feel shit about himself because you can do everything better and his way of making the cake was clearly not ok. It doesn't matter that you put on a calm, happy voice. This probably made it even more patronising.\n\n100% on point. This is stressing me out just reading about it lol.", "What was controlling?", "ESH - If you're a biker, going on a trip with someone with training wheels would suck.", "was it really thoughtful?  \n\nit sounds more like OP picked the activity because he'd enjoy it.", "I feel like making a cake is not something you can simply abandon partway through...it's not like they were at a movie and decided it sucked so much they should walk out.", "Really? I would love it even if I'm not that much into baking at home. You have all the ingredients, and tools and you don't even need to clean everything at the end! Plus you get cake, it sounds perfect to me.\n\nNot that my opinion or yours matter, but anyway OP says the friend mentioned wanting to try the experience and everything was planned, so I don't really see the issue.", "Sure, but someone who isn\u2019t in the third grade uses words to communicate their intended meaning.

Seems like bf maybe didn't want to be there to me, since he didn't really participate. And the icing was lumpy. He nicely offered to try to fix it. The bf is the only AH here.", "Agree. Also, not everyone enjoys baking, and not everyone wants to be given a task that they have to execute properly in order for it to turn out as a \"gift.\" Especially if he is stressed about law school or is already a perfectionist type. If he's never tried baking before, it's possible that it's because it's not something he cares about doing. The BF definitely could have handled his embarrassment or dislike of the activity better, or communicated to OP more that he was nervous about making mistakes and wants guidance but not someone to do it for him, etc. \n\nHOWEVER, OP seems not self-aware and unable to comprehend how this \"gift\" of a skilled task that BF has never tried to do before may actually feel more like a stressor than anything. And that's before the fact that OP actually ended up doing it all himself, which literally takes whatever bit of fun out of it for BF and is the icing on the embarrassment cake (pun intended).\n\nOP, please take this as a lesson in giving people gifts. You seemed to pick this gift for your BF because it's something YOU already like and enjoy (baking). It's generally better to pick gifts for the people to enjoy, and sometimes that takes the ability to swallow your pride on what YOU would rather do, in order to give them what they would like for their gift. Just because OP likes baking and decided it would be fun together as a \"gift\" doesn't mean BF has to like it too. But BF needs to work on communication, too.\n\nEditing to add: You guys have not been dating long at all. Some people, myself included, do not like doing \"new\" things or having to learn in real-time when we are around others who we are not 100% comfortable with yet. Granted, I have ADHD and am autistic, but I know neurotypical people like this, too. It's not necessarily always an ego thing of not wanting to look stupid around others, although it can be. For me, it's more that new situations and places can be stressful, and learning new skills can be stressful, so the idea of having to perform/learn a new skill in a new place is quite overwhelming. I'd go with my partner, who I've been dating for quite a long time. But I definitely would have recommended a different date spot during the first few months of our relationship! At this point, your relationship is still very fresh, and he probably isn't fully comfortable yet, so it's harder to let his guard down to be silly or make mistakes without worrying.", "If that was the case then the boyfriend should have communicated with him, instead of childishly leaving.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like OP was that overbearing, he might have tried too hard to make it perfect because it was at gift, but even if he was being anal about it the solution isn't to leave like that and hurt the other person, the whole \"I should have stayed home and studied\" was needlessly cruel.", ">I feel like the purpose here was to engage in an activity together, but OP would rather have the boyfriend sit and watch him bake a cake for him. That's hardly amusing.\n\nOn top of that, I get the feeling that boyfriend wasn\u2019t super interested in baking a cake in the first place. OP thought it would be a cute idea but didn\u2019t take into consideration if it was actually how boyfriend wanted to celebrate his birthday.", "I read it more as \u201cI went to do the batter and he instead of following and helping, decided to sit down at the workplace and not do anything\u201d. If he wanted to do the batter, he could\u2019ve gone and helped, or he could\u2019ve mentioned it before", "And honestly, if it comes out terribly then you have a great story to laugh about later.", "Thank you for this. I quote it all the time and nobody gets it!", "\u201clet me try fixing it\u201d is a demand.", "I really love horse riding. I asked my boyfriend (now husband) if he wanted to go horse riding with me for date night. \n\nHe said no. He didn\u2019t want to do it. \n\nSo we picked something else. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how much you can learn about a person\u2019s likes and dislikes if they actually communicate with you like an adult rather than (presumably?) bottling it up and then exploding.", "Yep, he seems to have decided what HE wanted to do for the BF's birthday. BF probably was more upset about that than the cake itself", "I agree with you. I hate it when someone just fumes silently and then blows up without even giving the other person a chance.", "OP decided to also make icing while he saw his date make some.

I always prefer to do things on my own so I can take my time and focus without being self conscious about the people I'm with and what they're thinking.

It's a clash of personalities, my kid would rather make a giant mess than accept help, and im convinced they need help when they do not. I have had to check myself and just ask instead, do you want any help or are you okay there on your own? If my kid says no I know I have to back tf off. My kid will not take kindly to overbearing people coming in and taking over.For me it comes from a place of kindness, I see them struggling, and want to help, my kid sees this as I am calling them incapable and how are they ever going to learn or have fun if they dont struggle and just make a mess and have fun doing that?It is my natural way of being and ive had to check myself when ive noticed ive naturally gone in and tried to help to remind myself I am not helping and to say sorry and step back.Ive also taught my kid to clearly state when they do actually want help. If they dont ask me for help, I will know they dont want it, although because they are my kid, ive still sometimes asked if they do. But I take no for an answer.\n\nEdit so the point of my spiel is, it's okay to be you, it probably is coming from a place of kindness, but it won't always seem that way to others.", "NTA. This situation is showing the level of his emotional maturity at handling small failures or how he would react with any success that you might have in anything. This is not good behavior at all and you deserve to be treated well.", "I would have let him go.

For your own sake, break up with this guy.", "NTA\n\nTell him happy birthday and best of luck with law school, then block and delete his number and move on with your life. It\u2019s far too short and you won\u2019t get the time back. There are men out there who would love this experience and wouldn\u2019t care if it worked out well or not.

Has something happened in his personal life that's caused him to feel grief, anxiety, or that's challenged him emotionally? Loss of a job, loved one, financial losses?

Time to cut your losses and move on, OP.", "No. NTA. But you don't need to date this guy. He's a big baby and not nice. He got embarrassed because of his frosting, but couldn't say that so he made it your fault. This will happen over & over with things big & small. It will suck.", "A gentle YTA. It can be really easy to bowl over someone and let perfectionism take over. The date idea was really cute, but the cake turning out \"good\" isn't really important. The important thing was letting him try and having a cute story for later. Fail cakes are amazing. They almost always still taste good, they just look silly and that's fine! It doesn't feel good when someone is trying to do something, made an error and want to try and fix it themselves. Commandeering the project just sends the message they can't fix it and that you would've done it right the first time. So I get why he was annoyed. He could work on communicating how he is feeling in the moment without it being confrontational, and you can work on realizing if and when you are taking over on a project even if that was not your intention.", "NTA, his reaction was violently overblown. He messed up the icing a little. You weren't making a professional cake, you were making a cake together for fun, and pray it at least tastes good if it looks terrible. His expectations of himself were way too high, and he took his anger out on you by blaming you for his anger. Red flags, he needs therapy.", "ESH.", "On one hand, this is a super sweet gesture.  On the other hand, I got a bit stressed out just reading this.", "Yikes! Don\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass on your way out!", "NTA. He sounds like a spoilt child.

He's a total jerk!", "As someone also in law school, he has to get used to being embarrassed and losing. He will not get far, there will be cases you should have won, but lose because of who the judge is. He\u2019ll get called out by judges, other attorneys, and clients regularly to preserve the record. This man needs to get his shit together if simple frosting has him act this way.", "\"As expected the icing was clumpy\" that made me soo mad.\nIf you get me to an activity that I have never done before and watch me do something wrong, judge me and then tell me 'let me fix this for you' yeah I will let you do your damn activity for yourself.

It was just the OP's cake. The BF had to watch the OP make the cake they were supposed to be making together (zero fun for the BF). Then the moment the BF tried to interject and add himself into the cake, the OP insisted the BF did it wrong and tried to fix it (OP being the wet blanket).\n\nPride? Ego? Because the one part of the cake that was immediately deemed wrong? That was the OP having pride/ego. \n\nWas the BF wrong in storming out? Maybe. But why would he want to stick around when he clearly wasn't wanted.", "I am not sure that the BF even messed up the cake. Recipes often do not work and saying that he overmixed the icing sounds a bit fishy.", ">**we both** measured and gathered the ingredients.

But he wanted to do an hombre effect to the cake, so **he also made** a strawberry flavored icing. So now we have to. I was kinda nervous at first because the attendants initially said that ingredients that are not part of the recipe will be an additional charge. Thankfully, he was not caught, and wth it is his cake after all. Problem is, it is his first time, and he overwhipped his icing.\n\nWhere are you even getting this?", "Because he had never baked anything before. If they'd have let him control the fun, it would have been a huge disaster and he'd have thrown an even bigger strop.", "Agree with you on this. Close to YTA because she said it was bonding time and it would be cool to make the cake THEMselves and then she ended up doing everything. If you tell me WE are baking a cake and then do all stuff by yourself while I sit down and watch you... why don't you just buy a damn cake?

My guess is they both could've handled it better.", "That\u2019s what happens when you over mix icing. I think that\u2019s what op was saying not that it was expected he would fail.", "So he said he wanted to experience a baking class, and then you did almost all the work and didn't even let him contribute his 'bad' icing?", "YTA\n\nYou took over HIS birthday date experience!", "It\u2019s the little things. Like taking over when baking the cake wasn\u2019t working instead of letting the bf try and fail. Picture a parent drawing with a child, that child going outside the lines, and the parent taking over to \u201cfix\u201d the drawing. The point is for both of them to have fun actually drawing together, but because the parent insisted on taking over the child feels like he\u2019s just supposed to watch and not have fun himself. That\u2019s what OP did here. The cake wasn\u2019t turning out the way OP wanted, so OP took over and took agency away from the bf. It\u2019s not malicious or anything, OP just has a bad case of perfectionism. Granted, the bf was over dramatic and needed to learn to stand up for his boundaries rather than blowing up later. Both need to mature a bit, so ESH.", "The BF said that OP was controlling the cake making - he started the batter on his own without BF helping - OP did the icing", "They were at the icing stage.  At that point it's really easy to just box it up and go.  You don't even have to bring the icing with you, cake is good on its own.", "YOu CAN. Just put everything down, say goodbye, and leave.

My hubby and I have done some crafting workshops even though that is NOT my forte, and we love to laugh at my misshapen masterpieces", "Imo, a shitty end product in scenarios like this should be the *goal*. Be silly, fuck up, and laugh about it. Who cares if the icing is falling off and the cake is a mess? Use the shitty icing to draw a bunch dicks and have a food fight with it in the parking lot afterwards!", "I had flashbacks reading this post. Op got to the part with the ombre icing and I teleported back to sitting there silently as a child... watching my aunt perfectly colour in MY colouring book for like two hours. \n\nSeems like Op railroaded over his boyfriend's birthday activity, and if it happens here, it's most likely happened before.", "He just sat down and didn\u2019t help. That\u2019s not on OP at all. If he wanted to mix the ingredients he could have used his words. He\u2019s a law student he should be capable. OP only said let me try because the boyfriend was getting frustrated and it wasn\u2019t working. He could have let OP work with the difficult icing then he worked with the icing that was easier to work with. Or communicated anything at all. Instead he got embarrassed and threw a hissy fit.", "it was a more blunt way of saying let me help.

He probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten upset at all if his icing experiment had succeeded.", "Ha this reminds me of a time my wife and I went to a cooking class. It was boring as hell, took forever, and we were starving. So during one break we just decided to leave and went to get some Shake Shack across the street.

You deserve to have a sense of agency and to try things even if you fail at them. People who take control away from us at a young age can create scared adults who also share that perfectionism.

That is typical of people trying to cook together.", "this.", "Admittedly me and my bf just bake at his and are only amused by things going wrong. Learn something from it for next time you know? \n\nIt's not super stressful if you're both chill about it and not super bothered, it's about the activity not the result. Our cinnamon rolls for example didn't rise and we had real trouble rolling it out when we realised he didn't have a rolling pin! (we used a glass instead lol) \n\nThe mistakes made it more memorable and fun imo. The cinnamon rolls still tasted nice even if they weren't perfect. We just laughed about it and enjoyed the moment."]}
