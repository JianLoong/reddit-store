I let him choose a cake, I paid it myself, and we were even given some freebies to play at the crane machine.\n\nI have to tell what happened in detail since it is important later.\n\nFirst off, we both measured and gathered the ingredients. When we both were able to get the stuff, I went to the stand mixer and started with the batter while he sat down at our workplace. As for me, I also sat because the recipe said to mix for 8 minutes.\n\nAfter batter was ready, we put in the molds.\n\nHere comes icing. I did the icing. But he wanted to do an hombre effect to the cake, so he also made a strawberry flavored icing. So now we have to. I was kinda nervous at first because the attendants initially said that ingredients that are not part of the recipe will be an additional charge. Thankfully, he was not caught, and wth it is his cake after all. Problem is, it is his first time, and he overwhipped his icing.\n\nWhen we were done, we had some down time. We need to wait for the cakes to finish cooling. When they were done and when it is time to assemble, he did his icing first. As expected, the icing was clumpy and was like butter and was not sticking to the cake. He tried fixing it, and it seemed to get worse. So I said calmly, \u201cLet me try fixing it.\u201d\n\nAll of sudden he disappeared. I noticed him at a table, approached him, and told him \u201cLet\u2019s finish the cake!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish the cake?! You\u2019re doing all the work.\u201d\n\nI was confused.\n\n\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry if you feel that way, you could\u2019ve told me earlier if you feel that way, so why not you finish icing and decorating?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d\n\nHe stood up. Left. And messaged me, and this is our convo:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? It\u2019s your cake. This is yours.\u201d\n\u201cBring it home then.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is yours.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Did I make it?\u201d (At this point I\u2019m like - well this is my gift to you)\n\u201cWe did. We did it together.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have tried baking, I haven\u2019t done baking. You did everything! You should\u2019ve just bought a cake for me. My time is wasted for this, and should\u2019ve just studied for law school.\u201d\n\nI was so shocked. I felt unappreciated and was close to tears. It is a gift after all.\n\nAs I don\u2019t want to escalate things further I just said sorry a bunch of times and begged for him to come back. He came back, but forced me to finish decorating the cake when I waited for him to come back so he can do it.\n\nAfter everything was done, I brought him to the train station, with him not talking to me all throughout, and just took the cake without saying goodbye.\n\nHere I am, wondering - AITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1681651219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o89s5/aita_for_giving_a_cake_to_my_date/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's bad at communication and out of touch with his own emotions. He will continue to lash out.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. You had a thoughtful and fun date idea to celebrate your boyfriend's birthday, and you even paid for the cake yourself. It's understandable that you were hurt and confused by your boyfriend's sudden outburst and refusal to finish the cake with you. You tried to talk to him calmly and even offered to let him finish decorating the cake, but he still chose to leave and be rude to you over a simple baking mishap\n\nNta", "ESH. Neither one of you seems willing/able to communicate with one another.\n\nYou seem controlling and likely did suck any fun out of the activity. \n\nHe acted childishly by stomping off and leaving.\n\nEither communicate with one another or just break up cause this isn't working.", "It seems to me like you were too invested in the cake turning out well, and you didn't want to let him just do things his way when he was trying to fix the icing he made.  If I were him, my feelings would be hurt because it was my birthday, and I would have expected my partner to be patient with me on my birthday.\n\nJust my 2 cents, I see a lot of disagreement.", "ESH. Sounds like you had a clear idea of what to make and how to make it. For him it was supposed to be fun but he didn't get to enjoy the experience because you were too focused on the outcome. If he sucks at baking you should have just allowed him to make a shitty cake. He shouldn't be so dramatic and could have just been honest that he didn't enjoy it. I don't like how he communicated the message but I get why he was upset with you.", "NTA. You wanted to do something genuinely nice for him and instead of admitting that he made a mistake, he basically made it your fault. Him not wanting to talk to you was also very immature. You deserve better than him.", "A kind ESH. \n\nThe date idea was super cute, but the point of it is that you do it together, or at best you help *him* do it, but it sounds like you took over and he mostly just watched you doing it, which defeats the point of going to this date to make it together. The one thing he got to do, you did it over because it wasn't good. The gift is paying for the ingredients and the experience, and if the cake is kinda messed up, its fine because you had fun together. Laugh about it and eat it anyway.\n\nBut I do think he's massively overreacting. He's completely blown up about it. I'm *guessing* he's been stressed with law school, so he was looking forward to actually *doing* something and not just watching someone do something, but he can't handle issues like this, that wasn't fair on you.", "NTA. I think you're focused a little too much on the gift aspect of it all, but it was a cute date idea. You could have tried to involve him a little more, but he also could have shown some interest, even if he didn't really wanna be there. Or at least he could have communicated that he wasn't having a great time so you could work on it together. \n\nHe sounds immature though. His reaction was over the top and childish.", "ESH - you\u2019re TA for being controlling.  He\u2019s TA for being a child.  Sounds like you\u2019re both terrible with communication and both have unrealistic expectations.  This relationship\u2019s foundation doesn\u2019t seem to be one based on compassion and love.  I\u2019d probably move on.", "NTA even if he is stressed out, even if he felt emasculated, even if he was sorry he was there, acting insulting and immature in public is tacky.  Only a month into this relationship and such a good lesson learned!", "NTA, but this dude is toxic. Instead of communicating his emotions or desires he just shuts down/explodes. Trust me when I say unless he realizes the behavior, it ain\u2019t gonna get better", "YTA, you did all the fun work and this date was not actually about him", "I'm going to say ... NTA because I genuinely do not understand what his anger stems from, but that could be  a failing in your telling to us and not in his telling to you.  \n\nIs he angry that you made him work for his birthday present, or is he angry that you did all the work for his birthday present?  \n\nI don't know know what his issue is, but the fact of it seems to be, he did not enjoy the date, and rather than just chalking this up to \"I don't really enjoy this guy's company to do pointless activities with him and enjoy the experience\" he's decided to cause a conflict to give him an excuse to break up without it being about him just not liking you.\n\nHe's really not into you.  That's the bottom line.  When you really like someone and you're in the initial stages of dating, the most trivial pointless shit is breathless and fun.  \n\nThis ain't that. \n\nHe's a slight asshole for not being grown up enough to break up without making a drama. \n\nNTA", "I don't really think you're the asshole here.  \nEven though you wrote the situation in detail I think there's a lot of nuance that can't be understood without being there like what the last couple of days were like in terms of college stress, the overall chemistry between you, the tone of voice when you offered to fix the cake.  \n\n\nThose things can play a part in how you two ended up in this conflict. But from what I can read, it seems like he was probably frustrated in not knowing how to bake and felt like you were doing so much that he felt guilty and therefore defensive, which boiled him until he unfairly snapped. But that's just a theory.  \n\n\nIn my personal opinion, I don't think you're an asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel like there may be some information missing.\n\nYou said 'the problem is it is his first time baking a cake and he overwhipped the icing' and 'as expected the icing was clumpy'\n\nHe could probably feel you watching everything he did like a hawk and silently judging/panicking that he is making YOUR cake wrong.  I think you may have made him feel embarassed and a bit stupid. \n\nThen hovering and interfering when he tried to apply the icing, immediately jumping in to 'fix it' for him. If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday. It was meant to be about having fun together and making him happy on his birthday, instead you made him feel shit about himself because you can do everything better and his way of making the cake was clearly not ok. It doesn't matter that you put on a calm, happy voice. This probably made it even more patronising. \n\nYou could have been laughing together trying to put the terrible icing on, making him feel the cake doesn't matter, he does.\n\nIf I were him I would have done exactly the same and told you to make YOUR perfect cake on your own without him there messing it up. \n\nAnd 'sorry if you feel that way' is not an apology.", "Obviously OP can't read a room.

Are you sure about his age? Because he just threw a major tantrum at not winning/making the cake the best. Just like my toddler.

It\u2019s ok if he got a little embarrassed about his icing, it\u2019s not ok for him to manipulate/guilt you into thinking it\u2019s all your fault and that you\u2019ve wronged him somehow. It\u2019s not ok for him to treat you the way he did. There are others out there who are more worth your time. This guy ain\u2019t it.", "Yous are both grown ass adults.

You should have a talk with my husband!", "NTA not really, maybe you could have said \"let's fix it together\" rather than just saying you'll fix it. But it was a nice idea and very thoughtful to not just buy a cake but also have a nice bonding experience. I think have another talk. He was out of order to walk off and not say goodbye even after you apologised.", "NTA. It\u2019s a red flag that he lashed out at you because he was embarrassed. Could even be borderline gaslighting because he\u2019s making you think you did something wrong with the cake when that\u2019s not how it played our at all \n\nIn my experience this won\u2019t change and if it\u2019s happening after only a month it might be best to get out now!", "NTA.\n\nYou've been seeing him for a month, and now you know enough to know that a month is enough.", "That guy must have been really really good looking.", "NAH. Just a lovers' quarrel.\n\nIt sounds like he felt you were too bossy in the cake baking session. You seem to know a lot about baking, and he might not, so he felt a little intimidated.\n\nAfter that, he had some sore feelings about it, so he began to criticize every aspect of it that bothered him in the slightest. For example, his time is scarce, and it did take extra time vs. just buying a cake. That might have hurt you because you inferred that he thought time spent with you wasn't worthwhile. But he might have intended to say that he'd rather spend his limited time with you doing something you both like.", "So for a future lawyer this is how he acts? tbh, he is so childish and moody basing on your story. He acts like he has temper tantrums.\n\n\nI would not want to be with someone like that if I were you.\n\n1) He seems ungrateful \n2) has temper management problem. He easily gets annoyed.\n3) Seems he wants to be the star. If his partner does better than him then he feels he should be the one doing better\n4) cannot talk about something before it becomes a problem\n5) He even had to say something harsh like he should have studied than being with you there.\n\n\nHe will do this again. I'm sure. If he acted this way in that scenario which could have not escalated but he chose to be too dramatic, he will for surely do it again in the future and guilt trip you. You will always be the one to make peace with him because he will get used to you always trying to say sorry and begging him to stay.\n\nNTA but next time, do not be too controlling and expecting for a good outcome especially if it's for a fun activity together. \n\nBe glad he showed you what he truly is and while it is still early. Do not let other people belittle you or make petty fights with you. It was so thoughtful of you to do that for him but he acted way out of line.\n\nI know you were trying to help him, OP but you could have also let him do the ugly icing. even if the cake turns out ugly, he knows it was on him. You could always say, \"let's do it together. I'll do this part. You do this. What do you think?\" so he or anyone will not get offended when all you are trying to do is help.", "Nta.

Your date was not just under pressure from studying, he was expecting you to be a mind reader, and lashing out because you aren't.

It's the attitude of a child under 10.\n\nAt this age, boyfriend should be more than capable of communicating when something is upsetting him before it escalates.", "I wasn't gonna touch on that, but it's true. Both parties have to be interested and every date won't go perfectly. I think the intentions were good, if not considered properly.", "I agree with you.  When I heard about this date idea, I immediately thought the business doing it is scamming people.  The majority of people don't want to cook their own birthday cake.", "I think this is an insightful take", "How did OP ignore it?", "That's why I voted ESH.", "How is that a scam?
