I let him choose a cake, I paid it myself, and we were even given some freebies to play at the crane machine.\n\nI have to tell what happened in detail since it is important later.\n\nFirst off, we both measured and gathered the ingredients.

As for me, I also sat because the recipe said to mix for 8 minutes.\n\nAfter batter was ready, we put in the molds.\n\nHere comes icing. I did the icing. But he wanted to do an hombre effect to the cake, so he also made a strawberry flavored icing. So now we have to. I was kinda nervous at first because the attendants initially said that ingredients that are not part of the recipe will be an additional charge. Thankfully, he was not caught, and wth it is his cake after all. Problem is, it is his first time, and he overwhipped his icing.\n\nWhen we were done, we had some down time. We need to wait for the cakes to finish cooling. When they were done and when it is time to assemble, he did his icing first. As expected, the icing was clumpy and was like butter and was not sticking to the cake. He tried fixing it, and it seemed to get worse. So I said calmly, \u201cLet me try fixing it.\u201d\n\nAll of sudden he disappeared. I noticed him at a table, approached him, and told him \u201cLet\u2019s finish the cake!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish the cake?! You\u2019re doing all the work.\u201d\n\nI was confused.\n\n\u201cHey I\u2019m sorry if you feel that way, you could\u2019ve told me earlier if you feel that way, so why not you finish icing and decorating?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d\n\nHe stood up. Left. And messaged me, and this is our convo:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? It\u2019s your cake. This is yours.\u201d\n\u201cBring it home then.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is yours.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Did I make it?\u201d (At this point I\u2019m like - well this is my gift to you)\n\u201cWe did. We did it together.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have tried baking, I haven\u2019t done baking. You did everything! You should\u2019ve just bought a cake for me. My time is wasted for this, and should\u2019ve just studied for law school.\u201d\n\nI was so shocked. I felt unappreciated and was close to tears. It is a gift after all.\n\nAs I don\u2019t want to escalate things further I just said sorry a bunch of times and begged for him to come back. He came back, but forced me to finish decorating the cake when I waited for him to come back so he can do it.\n\nAfter everything was done, I brought him to the train station, with him not talking to me all throughout, and just took the cake without saying goodbye.\n\nHere I am, wondering - AITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1681651219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o89s5/aita_for_giving_a_cake_to_my_date/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's bad at communication and out of touch with his own emotions. He will continue to lash out.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. You had a thoughtful and fun date idea to celebrate your boyfriend's birthday, and you even paid for the cake yourself. It's understandable that you were hurt and confused by your boyfriend's sudden outburst and refusal to finish the cake with you. You tried to talk to him calmly and even offered to let him finish decorating the cake, but he still chose to leave and be rude to you over a simple baking mishap\n\nNta", "ESH. Neither one of you seems willing/able to communicate with one another.\n\nYou seem controlling and likely did suck any fun out of the activity. \n\nHe acted childishly by stomping off and leaving.\n\nEither communicate with one another or just break up cause this isn't working.", "It seems to me like you were too invested in the cake turning out well, and you didn't want to let him just do things his way when he was trying to fix the icing he made.  If I were him, my feelings would be hurt because it was my birthday, and I would have expected my partner to be patient with me on my birthday.\n\nJust my 2 cents, I see a lot of disagreement.", "ESH. Sounds like you had a clear idea of what to make and how to make it. For him it was supposed to be fun but he didn't get to enjoy the experience because you were too focused on the outcome. If he sucks at baking you should have just allowed him to make a shitty cake. He shouldn't be so dramatic and could have just been honest that he didn't enjoy it. I don't like how he communicated the message but I get why he was upset with you.", "NTA. You wanted to do something genuinely nice for him and instead of admitting that he made a mistake, he basically made it your fault. Him not wanting to talk to you was also very immature. You deserve better than him.", "A kind ESH. \n\nThe date idea was super cute, but the point of it is that you do it together, or at best you help *him* do it, but it sounds like you took over and he mostly just watched you doing it, which defeats the point of going to this date to make it together. The one thing he got to do, you did it over because it wasn't good. The gift is paying for the ingredients and the experience, and if the cake is kinda messed up, its fine because you had fun together. Laugh about it and eat it anyway.\n\nBut I do think he's massively overreacting. He's completely blown up about it. I'm *guessing* he's been stressed with law school, so he was looking forward to actually *doing* something and not just watching someone do something, but he can't handle issues like this, that wasn't fair on you.", "NTA. I think you're focused a little too much on the gift aspect of it all, but it was a cute date idea. You could have tried to involve him a little more, but he also could have shown some interest, even if he didn't really wanna be there. Or at least he could have communicated that he wasn't having a great time so you could work on it together. \n\nHe sounds immature though. His reaction was over the top and childish.", "ESH - you\u2019re TA for being controlling.  He\u2019s TA for being a child.  Sounds like you\u2019re both terrible with communication and both have unrealistic expectations.  This relationship\u2019s foundation doesn\u2019t seem to be one based on compassion and love.  I\u2019d probably move on.", "NTA even if he is stressed out, even if he felt emasculated, even if he was sorry he was there, acting insulting and immature in public is tacky.  Only a month into this relationship and such a good lesson learned!", "NTA, but this dude is toxic. Instead of communicating his emotions or desires he just shuts down/explodes. Trust me when I say unless he realizes the behavior, it ain\u2019t gonna get better", "YTA, you did all the fun work and this date was not actually about him", "I'm going to say ... NTA because I genuinely do not understand what his anger stems from, but that could be  a failing in your telling to us and not in his telling to you.  \n\nIs he angry that you made him work for his birthday present, or is he angry that you did all the work for his birthday present?  \n\nI don't know know what his issue is, but the fact of it seems to be, he did not enjoy the date, and rather than just chalking this up to \"I don't really enjoy this guy's company to do pointless activities with him and enjoy the experience\" he's decided to cause a conflict to give him an excuse to break up without it being about him just not liking you.\n\nHe's really not into you.  That's the bottom line.  When you really like someone and you're in the initial stages of dating, the most trivial pointless shit is breathless and fun.  \n\nThis ain't that. \n\nHe's a slight asshole for not being grown up enough to break up without making a drama. \n\nNTA", "I don't really think you're the asshole here.  \nEven though you wrote the situation in detail I think there's a lot of nuance that can't be understood without being there like what the last couple of days were like in terms of college stress, the overall chemistry between you, the tone of voice when you offered to fix the cake.  \n\n\nThose things can play a part in how you two ended up in this conflict. But from what I can read, it seems like he was probably frustrated in not knowing how to bake and felt like you were doing so much that he felt guilty and therefore defensive, which boiled him until he unfairly snapped.

If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday. It was meant to be about having fun together and making him happy on his birthday, instead you made him feel shit about himself because you can do everything better and his way of making the cake was clearly not ok.

Just a lovers' quarrel.\n\nIt sounds like he felt you were too bossy in the cake baking session. You seem to know a lot about baking, and he might not, so he felt a little intimidated.\n\nAfter that, he had some sore feelings about it, so he began to criticize every aspect of it that bothered him in the slightest. For example, his time is scarce, and it did take extra time vs. just buying a cake. That might have hurt you because you inferred that he thought time spent with you wasn't worthwhile.

He easily gets annoyed.\n3) Seems he wants to be the star.

I'm sure. If he acted this way in that scenario which could have not escalated but he chose to be too dramatic, he will for surely do it again in the future and guilt trip you.

Do not let other people belittle you or make petty fights with you. It was so thoughtful of you to do that for him but he acted way out of line.\n\nI know you were trying to help him, OP but you could have also let him do the ugly icing. even if the cake turns out ugly, he knows it was on him.

It was very emotionally manipulative of him. Take all the red flags and do not pursue this relationship.

He's a petulant child and will likely spend your relationship gaslighting you into his control. Dump his ass.", "NTA, this guy was an absolute baby, however as an attorney, never take a law student out where they have do such mental labor. Take them places they don't have to think and can just relax. Even still, this dude was a baby and probably would complain in Maui.", "NTA. He sounds like a real baby, *but* when you\u2019re making plans for someone\u2019s birthday, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure it\u2019s something they\u2019ll really enjoy.

I did law school, a date like this would\u2019ve made my semester. Hell, a cake in itself would\u2019ve made my semester. I\u2019d have been smitten and over the moon about this. Especially in school when everything else is drab, boring, dry, stresspalooza, a cheerful loving fun date with someone who has the good sense to do something experiential and as different as possible that law school, absolute dream.

So NAH I suppose.\n\nWhen you give something that\u2019s an experience, you need to pay attention to how enjoyable the experience is for the other person. I also notice you didn\u2019t say much about how you interacted other than the cake stuff. So it\u2019s three things: a date, an experience, and a gift. As a date, it\u2019s important to spend quality time together \u2014 was there a good opportunity for this? As an experience, did he do much of the baking? And as a gift you were giving him the cake to take with him, but unless he really likes cake, birthday cake is more special shared. And if it\u2019s just a gift, rather than also working as a date and experience, then it did take a lot of time (and he\u2019s stressed out about studying). Also the one thing he tried to do turned out to be wrong (both in not working out, and in being something you weren\u2019t supposed to do according to the business).\n\nHe probably really needed that break, but if he wasn\u2019t really involved in the experience, or interacting with you as a date, then he would find it a waste of his time.", "NTA\n\nOne month and he behaves like this? Run for your life, this is only going to get worse from here!", "Bullet dodged", "ESH. You should have let him bake the cake. He should have said he wanted to do it instead of you doing everything. He seems like he is stressed out because of law school.", "NTA. You deserve better. My god don\u2019t apologize again.", "ESH. Next time ( if there is one) just give him a cake.", "ESH.", "hombre is spanish for man, ombre is french for shadow, btw", "I feel there are parts of this story missing. Probably because you were blind to them yourself. You probably thought you were helping, but sometimes doing a new activity with someone who knows what they are doing can suck if they aren't skilled in teaching and creating space for beginners.", "NTA. I think this was a cute idea for a date that turned out to be a bust. Baking together is actually not easy to do, and especially if one person is experienced and the other isn\u2019t. You\u2019re either taking turns doing steps, which gets awkward, or one person is watching the other. It\u2019s not like you can both operate the mixer. \n\nAnd when you are experienced and see the other making mistakes - it\u2019s not the easiest thing to respond to without either being controlling or condescending. Your other option is letting the project come out badly, as baking is not forgiving of mistakes, which can also go poorly in the end depending on the people involved. \n\nFor me, this was my experience trying to bake with my son when he was little. And because he was a child, he would sometimes feel sad if the end product wasn\u2019t good, so really it was not a great parent-child activity for us. Obviously other parents totally rock this; but I, like you, am not good at navigating that line. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Your date behaved like my son, but he is not a child. He just acted like one. This was a crappy date, but his reaction was ridiculous and outsized. I\u2019d be wary of whether this is how he handles things that don\u2019t go his way. Which is why I\u2019m going with NTA instead of saying N A H and chalking it up to a night of good intentions gone awry.", "NTA. Or the petulant baby.", "NTA\u2026your boyfriend is though", "Get away from this guy ASAP.\n\nHe treated you like dirt and you were trying to do something nice for him.

I ask based on your speech pattern and reference to a train station. Is he hyper-sensitive to failure? His reaction definitely seems out of line, but this seems like something that may be being influenced by additional cultural pressures that I don\u2019t know much about.", "EAH- this sounds like a non starter.", "NTA. I'm like you, I need to control everything in the kitchen and have little patience for mistakes so I would try to fix it too. My bf absolutely hates this. But... he didn't communicate with you and he went nuclear. You are just knowing each other and he didn't give you a chance to rectify your behavior,  even after you apologized. The birthday gift was a sweet gesture and, in my opinion, he doesn't deserve you.", "NTA. He was acting like a child. People show their true colors when they don\u2019t get what they want. This is a preview to the rest of your relationship with him.", "NTA. He sounds immature and not much fun. You planned a nice experience and he behaved like a toddler. Maybe time to move on.", "This is worth breaking up for in my opinion. I had a narcissist ex who would make every event miserable like this. I can't stand this behavior anymore especially from well seasoned ADULTS. he's a boy not a man. And in my opinion, what a waste. A true man will take things in strides and if he was unhappy you were doing all the work, he would have said \"hey actually do you mind if I do some more steps I'm really enjoying this\". Just big ew all around and I wouldn't put up with it. NTA. big time.", "He is an asshole. Also you\u2019re the asshole for making a weird misleading title for this post", "Sounds like you learned with only wasting a month of your time, what an asshole he is.  NTA. If he ever contacts you again, I would not reply.", "So you choose a stressful activity, where you each would be working independently.   \n\n\nWho even knew \"overmixing\" was possible?  \n\n\nHe may not have been gracious, but anyone would have been annoyed.  \n\n\nA relaxing night in each others company would have been a better choice.", "This is what happens when overachievers fail. They get angry and feel embarrassed and probably felt like you were \u201ctaking over\u201d due to his failure and not getting to \u201cbe the best\u201d.

Great analysis !!", "I agree with this verdict.  If it's about the experience, then the quality of the product doesn't really matter.", "Yeah, it would have been fun if they both were trying something for the first time and figuring it out together. However, it sounds pretty clear that OP had some experience baking, which he perhaps thought would impress the boyfriend but instead just made him feel foolish being the only one learning. I wouldn\u2019t have had much fun on this date either being schooled by my boyfriend, it would have made me feel like a child.", "Fun-sucker!!!!!", "That is probably what the BF meant by \u201cyou should have just bought me a cake\u201d. It was supposed to be a fun date. It doesn\u2019t matter how the cake turned out. But, it seems like OP was more concerned about having a perfect cake than a fun date.", ">Then hovering and interfering when he tried to apply the icing, immediately jumping in to 'fix it' for him. If it was your birthday then it would absolutely be understandable that you wanted to make a perfect cake, but it was for his birthday. It was meant to be about having fun together and making him happy on his birthday, instead you made him feel shit about himself because you can do everything better and his way of making the cake was clearly not ok. It doesn't matter that you put on a calm, happy voice. This probably made it even more patronising.\n\n100% on point. This is stressing me out just reading about it lol.", "What was controlling?", "ESH - If you're a biker, going on a trip with someone with training wheels would suck.", "was it really thoughtful?  \n\nit sounds more like OP picked the activity because he'd enjoy it.", "I feel like making a cake is not something you can simply abandon partway through...it's not like they were at a movie and decided it sucked so much they should walk out.", "Really? I would love it even if I'm not that much into baking at home. You have all the ingredients, and tools and you don't even need to clean everything at the end! Plus you get cake, it sounds perfect to me.\n\nNot that my opinion or yours matter, but anyway OP says the friend mentioned wanting to try the experience and everything was planned, so I don't really see the issue.", "Sure, but someone who isn\u2019t in the third grade uses words to communicate their intended meaning. They certainly don\u2019t silently run away in public and say \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me.\u201d", "Did you miss the part where they both got the ingredients and then the bf just sat down and let OP make the batter? Seems like bf maybe didn't want to be there to me, since he didn't really participate. And the icing was lumpy. He nicely offered to try to fix it. The bf is the only AH here.", "Agree. Also, not everyone enjoys baking, and not everyone wants to be given a task that they have to execute properly in order for it to turn out as a \"gift.\" Especially if he is stressed about law school or is already a perfectionist type. If he's never tried baking before, it's possible that it's because it's not something he cares about doing. The BF definitely could have handled his embarrassment or dislike of the activity better, or communicated to OP more that he was nervous about making mistakes and wants guidance but not someone to do it for him, etc. \n\nHOWEVER, OP seems not self-aware and unable to comprehend how this \"gift\" of a skilled task that BF has never tried to do before may actually feel more like a stressor than anything. And that's before the fact that OP actually ended up doing it all himself, which literally takes whatever bit of fun out of it for BF and is the icing on the embarrassment cake (pun intended).\n\nOP, please take this as a lesson in giving people gifts. You seemed to pick this gift for your BF because it's something YOU already like and enjoy (baking). It's generally better to pick gifts for the people to enjoy, and sometimes that takes the ability to swallow your pride on what YOU would rather do, in order to give them what they would like for their gift. Just because OP likes baking and decided it would be fun together as a \"gift\" doesn't mean BF has to like it too. But BF needs to work on communication, too.\n\nEditing to add: You guys have not been dating long at all. Some people, myself included, do not like doing \"new\" things or having to learn in real-time when we are around others who we are not 100% comfortable with yet. Granted, I have ADHD and am autistic, but I know neurotypical people like this, too. It's not necessarily always an ego thing of not wanting to look stupid around others, although it can be. For me, it's more that new situations and places can be stressful, and learning new skills can be stressful, so the idea of having to perform/learn a new skill in a new place is quite overwhelming. I'd go with my partner, who I've been dating for quite a long time. But I definitely would have recommended a different date spot during the first few months of our relationship! At this point, your relationship is still very fresh, and he probably isn't fully comfortable yet, so it's harder to let his guard down to be silly or make mistakes without worrying.", "If that was the case then the boyfriend should have communicated with him, instead of childishly leaving.\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like OP was that overbearing, he might have tried too hard to make it perfect because it was at gift, but even if he was being anal about it the solution isn't to leave like that and hurt the other person, the whole \"I should have stayed home and studied\" was needlessly cruel.", ">I feel like the purpose here was to engage in an activity together, but OP would rather have the boyfriend sit and watch him bake a cake for him. That's hardly amusing.\n\nOn top of that, I get the feeling that boyfriend wasn\u2019t super interested in baking a cake in the first place. OP thought it would be a cute idea but didn\u2019t take into consideration if it was actually how boyfriend wanted to celebrate his birthday.", "I read it more as \u201cI went to do the batter and he instead of following and helping, decided to sit down at the workplace and not do anything\u201d. If he wanted to do the batter, he could\u2019ve gone and helped, or he could\u2019ve mentioned it before", "And honestly, if it comes out terribly then you have a great story to laugh about later.", "Thank you for this. I quote it all the time and nobody gets it!", "\u201clet me try fixing it\u201d is a demand.", "I really love horse riding. I asked my boyfriend (now husband) if he wanted to go horse riding with me for date night. \n\nHe said no. He didn\u2019t want to do it. \n\nSo we picked something else. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how much you can learn about a person\u2019s likes and dislikes if they actually communicate with you like an adult rather than (presumably?) bottling it up and then exploding.", "Yep, he seems to have decided what HE wanted to do for the BF's birthday. BF probably was more upset about that than the cake itself", "I agree with you. I hate it when someone just fumes silently and then blows up without even giving the other person a chance.", "OP decided to also make icing while he saw his date make some. Anticipating failure.\n\nI mean... That would rub anyone the wrong way.\n\"Oh don't worry that your icing failed, here i have a batch ready to fix it right up\"", "How would two people make a batter? One holds the bowl and the other mans the spoon?  \n\n\nA shared activity would have been better.", "Yeah absolutely. Especially if you're a high achiever/perfectionist/anxious/low self esteem type, like I am.\n\nIt's so stressful to try new things with people I don't know that well and presumably want to impress. Hell I'm not even super comfortable trying new things with my boyfriend who I've been with for seven years. I always prefer to do things on my own so I can take my time and focus without being self conscious about the people I'm with and what they're thinking. If they are actively being impatient or condescending or trying to take over the process because I'm doing it wrong it's even worse", "You sound like the one who needs to mature up, if a simple baking lesson is going to trip you over an edge. Life has many unexpected difficulties and a extremely low stakes baking experiment is not one of them.\n\nThis person is going to fail as a lawyer.", "It's an offer of help", "I would personally love to go on a cake baking date \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Obviously it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but specialty ingredients/toppings can be expensive and not always available at a regular store. Not everyone has decorating supplies on hand. Seems like a fun twist on the Paint Your Own Mug idea but for bakers.", "Not that it makes any of this acceptable, but we are in exam time for law schools. I never was in the Greek system but nothing feels like hazing quite like law school exams. \n\nDid OP ask her boyfriend at any point of this was something he\u2019d actually like to do? Because if you don\u2019t enjoy cooking/baking in the first place, it would be like getting to do your own laundry for your birthday celebration. All the more so when everything he did was criticized. \n\nAll I know is if my husband had taken me to bake my own cake for my birthday while I was still in law school, especially at exam time, it would have probably ended in tears.", "Even if you were adamant about keeping the cake, which doesn't seem like you, her reactions were childish and she blew it out of proportion. If he communicates this way, you've dodged a bullet.", "I think they were just saying it's the kind of situation they'd prefer to avoid and wouldn't find fun, not that it would push them over the edge.", "It's pretty much stating: what you're doing is wrong, let me do it", "Him. It's two men."]}
