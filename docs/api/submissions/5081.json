And throwaway because I'm sure somebody I know uses Reddit.\n\nI (15f) am very afraid of the sound of sirens. It started when I was 10 and the only one at home when my grandfather had a medical emergency. Because we were in different areas of the house, I don't know how long the emergency had been going on for before I noticed. I was old enough to know to call an ambulance, and my grandfather was taken to the hospital. He ended up dying and I've always blamed myself for not hearing him and reacting quicker. For some reason, this manifested as me really hating the sound of sirens.\n\nThis year, my parents asked me what one of my new years' resolutions was going to be, and I joked that I was going to finally stop being afraid of sirens, no matter what it takes. For context, over the past two years I've been to five different therapists, each for a couple of months, but my parents keep switching me because they don't feel like I've made quick enough progress. I'm trying my best to get over my fear myself.\n\nWell, my parents decided that they were going to \"help\" me with my resolution, even though it isn't the new year yet. They've decided that a good idea is to wake me up with a recording of a siren on their phone. The first day they did it, I screamed and hid in the bathroom until I calmed down. I told them to stop but they said that it's been 5 years of me having this fear and it's about time I got over it. They've continued to wake me up in this manner. My mother said that, eventually, I'm going to stop associating sirens with death and start associating them with waking up, which would be more poetic if I didn't hate it so much.\n\nAnyway, last night I slept over at my friend's house. Waking up not to a siren was wonderful. In the morning, I called my parents and told them that I'm staying here until they stop with their nonsense. I'm happy to visit them and my siblings during the day, but I'm not going to let them keep scaring me. My parents told me that I'm ruining the holidays and I need to think about how I'm tearing apart my siblings (8m, 6f, and 4m). I told my parents that they're the ones who tore apart the family. But now I feel badly because that was a rude thing to say to my parents, and I'm also feeling ashamed for not getting over my fear for so long. AITA?

They are making the work of recovery harder. Desensitization often takes months because it has to be slow in order to be effective. The switching of therapists and now the treatment they\u2019re convinced is \u201ctough love\u201d is counterproductive. You need time to build a trusting therapeutic relationship that is safe and for your system to regulate after each session. Definitely stay with your friend, and see if one of your former therapists will take you back. They may be able to apply for funds - or help you access sliding scale resources - without needing your parents.  Good luck!", "NTA. Are they auditioning to work at Guantanamo Bay?", "NTA. \n\nWhat is the matter with your parents???! Switching your therapists every couple of months and then deciding they know best by terrorizing you with the very sound that you hate so much?

That is basically torture and child abuse.\n\nYou will have to face your fears with sirens through therapy and that will take time. What your parents are doing is compounding the issue. Might as well be the equivilant to someone who has been to war, came home with PTSD, and setting their morning alarm with gunfire as a cure to help them forget. The logic makes no sense. \n\nThey're saying you are ruining the holidays by actively avoiding them. Go full send, call CPS, and have them have to answer to whoever shows up on their doorstep to explain why they are psychologically torturing their daughter.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. This is child abuse. Your parents are intentionally triggering your PTSD. Call CPS. Tell a school teacher. This isn't okay, OP. This is cruel.\n\nAnd OP, if you do want to eventually get over your fear of sirens in a safe way, I recommend EMDR. It's a proven, safe, and quick PTSD treatment used by war veterans. Good luck to you.", "NTA - Your parents are just further traumatizing you. Please stay where you are safe.\n\nTreating a phobia can take years, but because your parents keep switching your therapists, you haven\u2019t had consistent treatment and instead had to start from the ground up every single time. They need to let you stay with a therapist you feel comfortable with and you two (NOT your parents) can set the pace and tone as you go. Find out what works for you. Because this is *NOT* it.", "NTA. What they're doing is not they way to 'cure' you. It's basically abusive. Stay way until they stop. If they ever try it again - call CPS.", "NTA. Your parents shouldn't be trying to treat your phobia. They aren't trained therapists. This \"exposure therapy\" seems like it isn't working anyway. If sleeping at someone else's house is what it takes for you to get some peace and quiet then go for it.", "I am sorry to see what you went through and your parents are making terrible choice\u2026\n\nDo you have any trusted adult that could talk with them? Like aunt, therapist or cousin? They need reality check and advice as they doing it wrong.\n\nNTA of course!", "NTA. There is no set schedule for recovering from trauma. You should in no way feel any sort of shame for 'not getting over' your fear in a timely manner. Let me emphasize: YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG OR DONE ANYTHING BE ASHAMED ABOUT!\n\nYour parents on the other hand are major AHs. Forcing you to change therapists so often and putting all of this pressure on you to 'be better' is almost certainly hampering any progress you might be making at learning to cope with your fears. They're now re-traumatizing you daily and laying down a guilt trip on top of that. Be firm in setting this boundary with them because clearly they do not listen to you and will continue to walk all over you.\n\nDo you have any other relatives or close friends families you can stay with that will help provide you with non-judgemental help? If you're still seeing a therapist I hope you also go over this whole situation with them in detail and that they can help you not only work on your fears but also how to deal with your AH parents.", "NTA they need to understand it\u2019s your personal journey not theirs and they are only hindering your ability to get over it, not actually helping.", "NTA.

They are, by not taking your trauma seriously.", "NTA the hell is wrong with your parents that's just going to transfer your hate of sirens to them instead that's a real dumb move on their parts.

Speaks. VOLUMES.\n\nYour parents think it's time you \"got over\" something that was very traumatic for you but they want it done on *their* timeline, not on yours. As in immediately. As in, if the therapist doesn't \"cure\" our kid within a few months, we'll go to someone else. Therapy isn't a course of antibiotics, there's a process involved, and they have to trust that process and allow it to unfold on its own time (and your time).\n\nNow that that hasn't worked, they've decided to take the ultimate shortcut. This is NOT ok. This is torture. All because your problem is inconvenient for them somehow and they've decided they know better than *five different therapists.*\n\nThe problem for the people you're staying with is, there's some possibility that your parents might be able to accuse them of kidnapping. If there's another family member you trust (an aunt or grandparent maybe) or a teacher, you need to consult them and find out what your options are. Those options may include CPS.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "OMG I'm really sorry that they've chosen this tactic. It's retraumatizing you over and over. It's not the way to get past your fear. Even if exposure therapy was going to work, my guess (not a counselor in any way shape or form) is that you'd need to be in a safe space and feel very safe and very aware and feel prepared AND have a professional there to help talk you through the process and coping strategies. I hope that as soon as you get the opportunity to choose your own counselor and have the means to stick with it as long as necessary, that you work with someone you can trust, and I hope you can get space from your parents so that you can better heal. Please don't be hard on yourself if you can't get past this very soon. This isn't about strength or character or lack of control. It's fear and fear cannot be reasoned with. It can be worked through with help. NTA", "My verdict: NTA\nYou clearly have a phobia and that\u2019s not easy to overcome. Well done you for trying to as lots of people wouldn\u2019t even attempt to get over their fears. It\u2019s completely understandable that you would be upset with what they\u2019re doing. No one would want to be woken up by a siren sound let alone someone with a phobia of sirens. It seems like they are undermining or don\u2019t understand your fear. I\u2019d try talking to them about it when you\u2019re all in a calm mindset. Try to get them to see your side without blaming them as this will just cause them to react defensively. If I were you I\u2019d try to get back to living at home asap, especially with you being 15 but obviously for this to happen your parents are going to need to approach your phobia in a different manner", "NTA. They do not get to decide if you are making progress or not. \nI suggest sitting down with them to talk. Tell them to just listen, not react. You obviously want to make progress and they are not helping, at all. Specifically with the siren alarms. It's like waking a veteran up with a recording of guns firing. Tell them to let you decide whether the (current) therapist is a good one for you. You are the one getting treatment, not them. Going to a different one isn't going to magically make your fears and trauma disappear. It's not a simple fear of sirens - this is something you need consistent support for, for a period of time that you choose. Tell them you need their support and understanding - not their impatience, their 'solutions', their complaints. Trauma doesn't just disappear - it is going to take time. \nIt will have to be in your terms - not theirs.\n\nAlso, you are not ruining the holidays. You said you were happy to visit them. If you truly feel bad about telling them they are ruining it instead, you can apologise for the way you said it, but that your point stands. They drove you away with their actions. How much further are they willing to push you away? Because that's all they are doing right now. \n\nBottom line is: you are not to blame for your trauma. You need support and understanding. Take the time you need, don't make them rush you.", "Nta. Not the same as your family relative but I can relate. last June, June 15 to be exact at 4:30am a coyote killed my old last living cat. I know that cause I was on the couch a couple feet away from the widow it happened at. I was awake cause of mouth pain from a surgery I had a couple months prior and luckily I didn\u2019t here any screams just the coyote howl and I thought it was a dog. I told my parents when they got up what I heard and they told me it was a coyote and they couldn\u2019t find the cat until they did on the front law. From that day foward I will not get up until 5 or later and I will not let my dogs out to pee in the dark. I let my parents do it. If I get up at 4:30 to go to the bathroom I have a panic attack that something might happen to my other living pets", "NTA!You have a phobia associated with trauma, and your parents are being foolish and unkind.(Being said, you probably can't leave home like this. In many places, your parents can call the police and have you forced back home. so, you need to have a discussion and come to some sort of agreement with your parents asap, even if it's just them acknowledging that you have moved out so young.)\n\nsorry you're going through this.", "So I'm a nurse, and I used to work in an assisted living facility. One day we had a resident collapse and I had to start CRP on them. This was the first time I'd ever had to do it. We called emergency service and there was about 10 firefighters and paramedics working on him. He was hooked up to this machine that helps the first responders with the CRP. It made a steady clicking noise. They worked on him for an hour and a half before they pronounced him dead. I heard that clicking noise the whole time. \n\nThis was 5 years ago. To this day, if I hear a clicking noise even close to that one, my whole body runs cold. \n\nI'm also the same way with the Emergency Alert System noise. When I was a child, my father kidnapped my brother and I, and while we were with him we heard the Amber Alert for us on the radio. I still have the urge to check on my little brother every time I hear it even though he's almost 24 now.\n\nSo, you are absolutely NTA at all. You had something traumatic happen. More often than not something like that takes years to work through, especially since you're still so young and your brain is still developing. It doesn't help that your parents are exasperating the issue and causing you to continue to have even more negative reactions to the noise. Exposure therapy should only be done by professionals. \n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this!", "You have PTSD. Or at least I believe you do. You have the signs from what you\u2019ve said here.\n\nYou need medical treatment. These feelings will not go away until you receive specific treatment that will allow your brain to be rewired on how to overcome this siren problem. For those that don\u2019t receive help, years and years can pass without getting better. \n\nAfter treatment, you will be much better. This isn\u2019t a simple, \u201cif you tried hard enough you wouldn\u2019t be afraid of sirens\u201d this is a case of your brain creating a safe barrier for you to not feel agonizing guilt/pain from the episode that started this whole thing.  The siren sound is a warning your brain created to protect you because you didn\u2019t receive treatment right away for your traumatic experience.\n\nContact someone who specializes in PTSD, and follow their treatment plan. Be warned, if your parents don\u2019t stop using sirens to \u201ccure\u201d you, you brain will create a new protection device for you to live, and you will not be able to choose what your brain selects. It could be anything not associated with that sad day when you were 10.\n\nAs for your parents, ask for their help first, explain that you think you have PTSD, and ask them to help you get better. If they laugh or refuse to believe you, seek help through the parents that are letting you stay, or through your grandparents, or someone you trust.\n\nThis can all be over in a matter of less than a year, especially since you are so young as your brain is still growing.  Young people do quite well with proper treatment.", "NTA.  Of course you haven't made progress with any of the therapists you've seen.  They haven't left you with any one of them long enough to build a therapeutic relationship, much less to delve into the roots of your reaction to sirens.  Something like this will take a great deal of time to resolve.  It needs to be done gently and carefully.  I think your parents need to sit down with you and your therapist (someone you choose, not them) and have a frank discussion of the therapeutic process.  Clearly, they have no clue that what they are doing is causing more harm than good.", "NTA.  Instead of acting like they are therapists, the sane thing for your parents should be setting you up with a counselor to help you through this issue with sirens.", "NTA", "Can I say, I totally understand. I've been in therapy on and off for years, and just recently my therapist managed to suss out the origin of my anxiety. When I was about 11 or 12, my dad's cousin was murdered. I'm now approaching 30, and I was embarrassed this was still bothering me, but I still have anxiety about people I love dying (no, I didn't really know this cousin well, but it was a bit of a shock for a child to realize people don't just die when they're old and sick and there may be zero warning). Or sometimes I'll have morbid thoughts, like while driving over a bridge and I'm like \"if this bridge gave out my last meal was McDonald's, idk how to feel about that\". I can't remember exactly what my therapist called it, but that event at such an impressionable age is where this all started. What I'm trying to say is that I am not a professional but it isn't crazy that this is still affecting you five years later considering how hard that event must have hit you and at the age it did. \n\nYou are NTA, and I hope you manage to conquer this, but know that there is no shame in it taking a while. Sometimes these things lodge in our brains and it can take so long to get them to stop affecting us. I saw another commenter suggested EMDR, and I wholeheartedly second that, its what's been helping me with a lot of my stress and issues. It's super calming and when led properly by someone with training, it can almost be like a reset button in the brain in regards to triggers, helping rewire things a bit. Again, not a doctor, but my experience with it has been wonderful and it's good for exactly this type of thing. I've been told that a lot of therapists offer this but are not specifically trained in it, so that's something to keep in the back of your mind as well.
