He often misses social cues and is not received well by others. \n\nIn March, my husband received a random text asking if George was his brother. The texter told my husband that George was stalking his girlfriend, Jenny. George made new emails and fake numbers to contact her when she blocked him, saying he is going to \u201csave her from this world.\u201d George and Jenny had been friends, but Jenny rejected his advances and began dating her current boyfriend.\n\nMy husband reached out to George about it, but George sent a lot of excuses, saying he was just trying to be her friend and that she still wants to be friends with him. He claims it\u2019s her \u201cidiotic boyfriend\u201d who keeps blocking him. My husband told George to back off from Jenny, and we thought that was the end.\n\nI am apart of a private Facebook group for the community we live in, and my husband does not have FB so I am the only one who sees what\u2019s posted there. 2 days ago Jenny posted there asking the neighborhood for any information about George because she is trying to take legal action against him for stalking. She said he does not live here, and she posted pictures and videos of him walking repeatedly near her house. He has been continuing to create fake emails/numbers to contact her. Jenny added that a few days ago her boyfriend had to chase George away from their house after he was watching them sit on their patio. \n\nI freaked out and told my husband, who immediately contacted George and asked him if he had seen the post. He hadn\u2019t since he does not have a FB, but he was very upset and said they were framing him and this is a big misunderstanding.\n\nMy husband then contacted his parents about the post. After speaking to George on the phone, my father in law texted my husband and told him that he believes George and that this is all a big misunderstanding. He then told us the best course of action would be for me to post a comment defending George and saying Jenny is framing a harmless man. He also wanted us to post that George does live in the neighborhood.\n\nMy husband responded to FIL by saying that the only thing we know is untrue about Jenny\u2019s post is that George doesn\u2019t live in the neighborhood. My husband told him that I was not going to post anything because we don\u2019t know if George is harmless, and we believe Jenny. My FIL called and said he is disgusted by us. He said that he is extremely disappointed in my \u201csilence in this unjustified witch hunt.\u201d I am the only person who could defend George, since I am a member of the FB group. My husband hung up and we haven\u2019t had contact since.\n\nA part of me does feel bad that Jenny said George doesn\u2019t live in the neighborhood, because he has lived here for 7 months and is not a complete creep driving here just to stalk her house.

They also probably don't want him moving back.\n\n**Don't** bring them in, they clearly don't believe how bad things are, and now are trying to pin everything on you (\"*if only OP would post that George is terrific, this would all go away*\") to continue on with their magical thinking.\n\nHe's made **new emails and fake phone numbers** to contact her!! That IS stalking and not-normal, whether or not he lives in the neighborhood.\n\nDo you have adult social services? It sounds like he has some mental health issues and needs help. Maybe if the police get involved it will mean George must get help.\n\nBut your inlaws have a Disney/Hogwarts level of fantasy thinking that George is merely \"*misunderstood*\" rather than in need of help. Do **NOT** let them blame you or force you to clean up the mess. Good luck and keep us posted.", "NTA!  Your inlaws are in denial about George. \n\nYWBTA if you defended a stalker. Maybe for Jenny's safety, you could reach out to her privately and let her know George lives in the area. After all, we never know what a stalker is capable of, and it could save George, Jenny or her boyfriend from being hurt or killed. Seriously.", "Update: my husband came home from work and after we spoke a little more about the situation, he told me that this is not the first time George has stalked someone, it\u2019s actual the 2nd! I guess the other was when he was 21. He would follow her around at university to try to talk to her, despite her rejected advances, and he stopped after her parents got involved since they were younger at the time. My husband said he was hesitant to tell me because he was hoping things would be different, but now he feels we should message Jenny because George needs to realize this behavior is unacceptable, whether it\u2019s by the police or someone else. We\u2019re going to message her and tell her that he lives in the community, but we don\u2019t know his exact address because he lives in an apartment building and we\u2019ve only visited once when he walked us there and did not give us the address. We\u2019re going to try to explain where he lives, and let her know she can reach out to us if she needs any more help.", "NTA of she doesn't have a claim for stalking, the police will dismiss her. \n\nYou are right not to publicly endorse him when you don't have all the facts. \n\nHe's *probably* being a creep.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you defend your BIL's stalking? That would be RIDICULOUS, and hurt YOUR social standing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and is not a complete creep driving here just to stalk her house. \" .. He is - and you know it. The drive is just shorter.", "NTA\n\nYou don't know the truth and not fair to you to risk your reputation on what you don't know.  \n\nIt's a matter for the courts, or for George to stop being weird if he actually did send those messages.", "NTA.   Jenny is the victim here, not George.   You know in your gut that George is not an innocent here and posting that he lives in the neighborhood is not going to help his case anyway.", "NTA.\n\nCan we look at the facts? George claims he was friends with Jenny but she doesn't even know he lives nearby? Have they actually talked? George keeps making burner accounts to contact her? George claims that the bf is the one blocking him, but Jenny makes a FB post talking about wanting to take legal action against him?\n\nHonestly I would reach out to Jenny. Sure, you can let her know that George does actually live in the neighborhood, but also I think you might want to hear her full story. Frankly it *does* sound like to me that George is stalking her.", "I hope you gave Jenny all the information you have to help her get a restraining order. This whole thing could go south very quickly.", "INFO: did he move to the neighborhood and *then* meet Jenny... or is he so obsessed that he *moved neighborhoods* to be close to her and able to watch her at all times?", "You should ask FIL if he wants you to post all relevant info in the group, that George does indeed live in the community, AND that he has a history of stalking. If he doesn\u2019t, ask why he thinks it\u2019s appropriate to get involved only in ways to endanger Jenny and clear George\u2019s rightfully soiled name. \n\nNote that this will probably tank that relationship. Not that it seems like a valuable one. \ud83e\udd37", "Has anybody bothered to just talk to George??", "You and your husband should be on Jenny's side in this. She is being stalked and harassed and *nobody* can know that he will not escalate.\n\nThis situation is way above reddit's pay grade and needs to be handled carefully to ensure nobody gets hurt. If anything I'd suggest Jenny look into the risk/reward for whatever she's planning to do. Something like a restraining order may not have the effect that she would like.", "NTA, but there are a whole lot of AHS here. Facebook is not a court of law, any legal defense would need to be made when/if Geoege is formally accused and goes to trial.  Responding on Facebook would only accomplish stirring the drama pot and perhaps inadvertently saying something that can be used against OP or George.  Providing information related to George's general location is not a good idea.  If something must be done about the post, report it as a community standards violation or privately message the group Admin.  These are things husband or FIL can make an account to do if they are so inclined, no need to act through OP and potentially drag their reputation since there is a good chance there is some merit to the allegations.  If they want to be warriors hiding behind OP, nope to that.  They are AHs for insisting on that.  There is a very low bar for making am account and posting themselves. It is false to say OP is the \"only one\" that can help.\n\nJenny, while a victim, is also an AH for the Facebook post.  It is not the proper forum for that sort of allegation.  It is tacky, potentially promotes vigilantes, and makes George guilty without any burden of context or proof.\n\nFinally, Geoege is an AH for stalking Jenny and not taking no for an answer.  I can totally see why she finds his behavior violating and potentially dangerous.  Someone really needs to make sure he understands the severity of this situation and convince him to adjust his behavior/get him help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

George has only lived in the neighborhood for a few months, did he move to be closer to her?", "Sounds like his brother has talked to him a couple times about this.

But there are many more services for people than you might realize. If the cops do get involved, they might bring (or you may be able to request) a social worker. This is pretty rare outside some more progressive places tho.\n\nAlternatively, you can look into social services and social workers. There are some organizations that's whole job is finding the right services for someone, which might be able to do the legwork for you if they're willing/able to take George on as a client. Or you could look around yourself.\n\nSome keywords to start your search would be \"social services\" or \"behavioral health\".", "Do not defend a stalker, even if he is family.

Dumbass. You probably do that same shit", "This sounds very similar to an older male student who stalked me when I was in early high school.  He asked if he could touch my bra and followed me off the school bus (he also lived in our neighborhood).  We had to get school officials in involved.  \n\nSomething needs to be done, George is stalking someone.  Whether it's APS, the police, something needs to change.  Jenny deserves to feel safe.

Also good that you two are giving Jenny your support.\n\nA second incident, even if 10 years apart, is not a good sign. Your BIL needs professional help now that could head this off a path where something worse happens. It could be the difference of being in a future healthy, happy mindset, or a prison sentence."]}
