You were told he wouldn't be there.", "Slight YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t agree that when you accept a ride from someone you\u2019re dependent on their schedule. You\u2019re dependent on the agreed upon schedule. You all agreed you would drive up and leave the next day. Just because she did them a favor by driving doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t ruin the whole event for them and possibly the bday girl. \n\nYou knew him coming was a possibility. You should have anticipated that and either driven alone or let the others know if he shows up you will leave so they can decide other arrangements (not in the moment and at midnight). He was their friend before you were and even though he said he couldn\u2019t make it, you should have planned for that possibly happening and not offered rides if you literally can\u2019t stand to be in the same house as him. \n\nConsidering he didn\u2019t do anything to antagonize you and you could, and did, retreat to a bedroom I think you\u2019re in the wrong. \n\nWhile you have every right to leave a situation you aren\u2019t comfortable, you also still need to acknowledge that your decision to leave impacted others. And having an attitude of \u201cwell I gave them a ride and they could have just taken a cab across the state if they wanted to stay\u201d is asshole behavior.

I have a few questions.\n\nDid you drink at the party?  When you went to bed, was the party over or was everyone else still up?  When you left, were the people who rode with you in bed as well?

You were very upfront about not wanting to be at the with your ex and you did everything you could to be sure he wasn't there before you traveled there. The girls that traveled with you knew that. So it shouldn't be a big surprise to them that you wanted to leave when the circumstances changed and your ex was at the party. The girls that traveled with you had a choice, travelling back with you immediately or stay and travel back with public transport or a cab. Only the last options will cost them money.", "Yeah obviously taxi isn't great bit split 4 ways is easier and they could have gotten the bus.\n\nNancy also knew op's attendance was contingent on the ex not showing up and should have kicked him out.", "I didn't drink at the party as I'm on anti depressants and they make hangovers really wretched. Everyone was still up at the party when I went to bed and when I asked to leave as well. Ex was still there and just getting settled in. Party wasn't over, it was supposed to carry on to the next day with brunch and manicures. \nI didn't leave immediately because I wasn't sure if he was just stopping by (didn't seem likely because he lives hours away close to where I lived so it's unlikely that he traveled so far to only stay a few hours) and I did try to stay in the room but I felt suffocated.", "It literally says it in the post they could have.", "That's fair.  Also you asked ahead of time.  After Nancy promised you that he wouldn't be there and you made it clear your attendance was reliant on him *not* being there - she had a responsibility to kick him out.\n\nIf you hadn't made it clear you'd only go if he wasn't there it might be different but you did. And when you told her you were leaving she could have said \"I'm sorry, I had told you he wouldn't be here, I'll make him leave now. Give me ten minutes.\"", "Ok - thank you for the clarification.\n\nClearly NTA here.", "I do think it's worth considering that a cab to a place in a different part of the state could be prohibitively expensive, especially if the other 3/4 aren't sticking around to split it with you. That being said, OP isn't TA, Nancy either lied or didn't make sure that OP's ex knew he wasn't welcome, and violated a pretty simple boundary that OP set out.", "True, it does technically say that.", "Yeah she did try for an hour. There are people who can be irrational about exes, but op has stated her boundaries clearly and calmly and did appear to try making it work.  \n\nI also don't blame her for struggling to sleep knowing a person you don't trust is in the house. That can be scary.", "He was welcome, that was made clear to OP. He just said that he wouldn't be able to make it. It was probably a miscommunication. NAH.", "You pick weird things to harp on", "Yeah, no. This was on purpose. The evasiveness when she questioned the friend and the fact that he showed up halfway through is far too suspicious to merely be an accident. NTA", "Lying?  That's silly.

You said in advance that you didn't want to go if the ex was there.", "NTA /they could\u2019ve found a different way home", "ESH. Sounds like Nancy lied about your ex not coming. So she\u2019s an AH.\n\nYou committed to driving people, and I assume had a schedule laid out to some extent, then changed it in the fly.

You had planned to say overnight and basically the whole next day.", "But not if they completely change plans like this. There's a mile of difference between being on the driver's schedule as to whether you're going to leave at 10:00 or 11:00, and what happened here where OP derailed the whole plans of staying overnight.", "I feel like that distinction is important - if you can't be in the same place as someone, you need to make sure the \"he's not coming\" is a bit firmer, especially when you're several people's ride.\n\nThe thing about the ride is, would these people have organised alternative transport if OP hadn't come? It changes the equation a bit if it's \"we rode with you because you were coming, otherwise we'd have driven\". And that isn't clear here. \n\nThat said, Nancy should have let OP's ex know he couldn't change his mind.", "Exactly it would only be a few hundred maybe a grand for a cab they could have split it", "Did you know that sometimes people feel emotional pain?", "People have emotions.", "Wrong post.", "The plans were inherently not what the driver had agreed to. Your argument is based on the idea that only the driver's situation had changed. The host lying to guess makes it reasonable for guests to leave earlier than planned, because now they know they cannot trust their host", "And also I'll just say in general, if you're ever going into an initial conversation with someone and they are trying to talk you that down and don't want to accept your position at all, and then they just come back later saying they're going to give you exactly what you want. You should be suspicious of that.", "Lol, nope, you have teenager vibes. I\u2019m guessing 13?", "OP shouldn't have gone in the first place then. She wouldn't be friends with Nancy except because of the ex. It's not a pre-existing friendship that exists notwithstanding the ex.", "There was no evasiveness, she told OP you're invited even if he comes and then relayed that he wasn't going to be able to make it.

OP said they would not go if ex did. Friend lied.", "Or the friend was told he wouldn't be in attendance and he decided to stop in at the last minute? It's not unheard of for plans to change, and the ex's plans may very well have changed, making him able to attend, so he showed up given they're longtime friends. Nowhere does it say the friend knew he was coming, and claiming they lied is a leap.", "Lying to OP about ex not being there is in fact the AH move.
