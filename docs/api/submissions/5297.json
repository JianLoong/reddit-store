I was introduced to her by my ex who's been long time friends with N's husband. \n\nMy ex and I split up 3 months ago and I'd enforced no contact. It was Nancy's birthday a few days ago and she invited me. Because I met her through my ex and he'd been friends with Nancy and her husband for years before me, I asked if he would be there. She said it shouldn't matter and that I was welcome even if he was. I said it would make me uncomfortable to bump into him. She later confirmed that my ex said he wouldn't be able to make it so I agreed to go. \n\nI live in a different part of the state and she had other friends she'd invited from the area so I agreed to drive around 4 other girls to Nancy's birthday, stay the night, then come home the next evening. \n\nWe get there and everything is going great, dinner, birthday cake, pool party, at around half past midnight, my ex shows up. He kept his distance and didn't try to talk to me beyond an initial greeting but I felt awful and couldn't stand to be around there. \n\nI tried going to bed but I couldn't sleep and after about an hour, I told Nancy and the girls who'd carpooled with me that I would be leaving to return home. \n\nSince the girls had no way of getting back without me (besides public transport or a cab), they had to pack and leave with me too. Two of them have been completely understanding and say that I shouldn't have to be around someone I'm uncomfortable with, especially since I'd asked (and checked several times) if he would be coming.

That\u2019s frankly wise in the majority of situations (some rare exceptions may apply such as shared childcare and then distance is good).\n\nYou didn\u2019t make your friends leave. They absolutely could have taken a cab if they wanted to stay or talked to someone else there about getting a ride back. Breakups can be incredibly rough and even if they aren\u2019t it\u2019s a good idea to get as much distance as reasonably possible.", "NTA. When you get a ride with someone, you accept that you're going to be arriving and leaving on their schedule (unless you want to go with a cab or public transport, as you said). Even if he hadn't shown up, wanting to go home after midnight wouldn't be an asshole move. I would talk to Nancy about it -- ask her why he showed up, etc -- before drawing any conclusions about what she thinks.", "That was a reasonable response on your part. I might not have chosen to venture on a trip like that based on \u201che says he\u2019s not coming\u201d as opposed to \u201che\u2019s not invited\u201d, but you did, and then he was there, and you\u2019re no contact for whatever reason (not necessarily relevant here) so you left.\n\nI mean, you were there past midnight. Past 1:30, it sounds like. You were there for a lot of party. I think it\u2019s totally reasonable to not want to stay under the same roof as someone you\u2019re no contact with. That\u2019s not what you signed up for when you agreed to come. It\u2019s explicitly what you were avoiding, in fact.\n\nNAH", "From your description, it sounds like you stayed at the party for a few hours, so you fulfilled your commitment of going.

Here is how it reads to me: He avoided you and you decided you couldn't bare to be ignored and threw a tantrum and left. You could have easily gone to bed (you had).

Don't pay any mind to PGR73, or similar comments that aren't mindful and add nothing to the proceedings; you took care of your boundaries.

I just wanted to go home.", "Honestly, never. I don't mind stepping around him for a few more months until he leaves the state (he works for the government and is due for a transfer)", "NAH then. You're allowed to leave places you don't want to be. His friends don't have to put in extra effort to make sure you two are never around each other. People relying on you for transportation can make other plans.", "NTA, but also this is gonna be a big problem going forward, and getting over it is the necessary move if you want to maintain this friendship.", "NTA. You were told he wouldn't be there.", "Slight YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t agree that when you accept a ride from someone you\u2019re dependent on their schedule. You\u2019re dependent on the agreed upon schedule. You all agreed you would drive up and leave the next day. Just because she did them a favor by driving doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t ruin the whole event for them and possibly the bday girl. \n\nYou knew him coming was a possibility. You should have anticipated that and either driven alone or let the others know if he shows up you will leave so they can decide other arrangements (not in the moment and at midnight). He was their friend before you were and even though he said he couldn\u2019t make it, you should have planned for that possibly happening and not offered rides if you literally can\u2019t stand to be in the same house as him. \n\nConsidering he didn\u2019t do anything to antagonize you and you could, and did, retreat to a bedroom I think you\u2019re in the wrong. \n\nWhile you have every right to leave a situation you aren\u2019t comfortable, you also still need to acknowledge that your decision to leave impacted others. And having an attitude of \u201cwell I gave them a ride and they could have just taken a cab across the state if they wanted to stay\u201d is asshole behavior. You broke the agreement between you and the friends and don\u2019t seem to care at all.", "NAH, as long as everyone involved understood your \"rules\".", "Slight YTA.", "> They absolutely could have taken a cab\n\nDo you absolutely know that for a fact?", "I was with you up until :\n\n>and don\u2019t seem to care at all.\n\nMy ex and I had a terrible break up and I've been struggling to move on. He's blocked on everything and this party was supposed to be a girly pool party thing so I thought it was safe to assume he would skip out. I was really upset and did care very much about ruining the party, but I wasn't gonna sit up all night sobbing (and I wouldnt even have the room to myself because I'd have been sharing it with two other girls) or trying to control my sobbing in an unfamiliar place.", "Uh was this meant for another post?", "\u201cbesides public transport or a cab\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in the post that a cab was an option.", "Yes, cabs would have been available the next day, as well as frequent buses.", "Oh no, worst case scenario they have to accept the ride she offered them like they did.", "That makes sense, it seemed you were only thinking of yourself since you didn\u2019t mention any internal conflict with leaving or going (I think you did actually when you tried to stay in the bedroom for a while before deciding to leave, so apologies there) and so readily suggested a cab for them. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should have stayed but maybe you need to reconsider friendships with people your ex is also friends with if your reaction is this severe, now that you know you absolutely can\u2019t be around him. \n\nAlso, this will pass. You\u2019ll be laughing about how much you cared now in the not so distant future.", "Well, you did what you needed to do for you.

But not relevant to anything in this conversation, as far as I can tell.", "Very relevant.  OP clearly said public transport or a cab was available to the other girls, and you assumed OP was lying and actually meant besides whatever options are available.", "Info.  I have a few questions.\n\nDid you drink at the party?  When you went to bed, was the party over or was everyone else still up?  When you left, were the people who rode with you in bed as well?  Was the ex still there when you left?  Was the party over when you left? Why did you not leave when the ex showed up?", "NTA\n\nYou had good reason to leave and everyone still had choices - Nancy could have found them another ride or offered to take them back herself the next day, since it was her mistake. (She confirmed your ex wasn\u2019t coming, which was your stipulation for going, and then got you to carpool.)\n\nI\u2019m suspicious of when Nancy or your husband knew your ex would be there - if they knew he was likely to show up before you got there and didn\u2019t warn you then they aren\u2019t really your friends anyway.", "NTA. You were very upfront about not wanting to be at the with your ex and you did everything you could to be sure he wasn't there before you traveled there. The girls that traveled with you knew that. So it shouldn't be a big surprise to them that you wanted to leave when the circumstances changed and your ex was at the party. The girls that traveled with you had a choice, travelling back with you immediately or stay and travel back with public transport or a cab. Only the last options will cost them money.", "Yeah obviously taxi isn't great bit split 4 ways is easier and they could have gotten the bus.\n\nNancy also knew op's attendance was contingent on the ex not showing up and should have kicked him out.", "I didn't drink at the party as I'm on anti depressants and they make hangovers really wretched. Everyone was still up at the party when I went to bed and when I asked to leave as well. Ex was still there and just getting settled in. Party wasn't over, it was supposed to carry on to the next day with brunch and manicures. \nI didn't leave immediately because I wasn't sure if he was just stopping by (didn't seem likely because he lives hours away close to where I lived so it's unlikely that he traveled so far to only stay a few hours) and I did try to stay in the room but I felt suffocated.", "It literally says it in the post they could have.", "That's fair.  Also you asked ahead of time.  After Nancy promised you that he wouldn't be there and you made it clear your attendance was reliant on him *not* being there - she had a responsibility to kick him out.\n\nIf you hadn't made it clear you'd only go if he wasn't there it might be different but you did. And when you told her you were leaving she could have said \"I'm sorry, I had told you he wouldn't be here, I'll make him leave now. Give me ten minutes.\"", "Ok - thank you for the clarification.\n\nClearly NTA here.", "I do think it's worth considering that a cab to a place in a different part of the state could be prohibitively expensive, especially if the other 3/4 aren't sticking around to split it with you. That being said, OP isn't TA, Nancy either lied or didn't make sure that OP's ex knew he wasn't welcome, and violated a pretty simple boundary that OP set out.", "True, it does technically say that.", "Yeah she did try for an hour. There are people who can be irrational about exes, but op has stated her boundaries clearly and calmly and did appear to try making it work.  \n\nI also don't blame her for struggling to sleep knowing a person you don't trust is in the house. That can be scary.", "He was welcome, that was made clear to OP. He just said that he wouldn't be able to make it. It was probably a miscommunication. NAH.", "You pick weird things to harp on", "Yeah, no. This was on purpose. The evasiveness when she questioned the friend and the fact that he showed up halfway through is far too suspicious to merely be an accident. NTA", "Lying?  That's silly.  I don't think OP was clear (though they have since clarified), and I know that humans are not always precise."]}
