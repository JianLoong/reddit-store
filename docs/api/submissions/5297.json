I was introduced to her by my ex who's been long time friends with N's husband. \n\nMy ex and I split up 3 months ago and I'd enforced no contact. It was Nancy's birthday a few days ago and she invited me. Because I met her through my ex and he'd been friends with Nancy and her husband for years before me, I asked if he would be there. She said it shouldn't matter and that I was welcome even if he was. I said it would make me uncomfortable to bump into him. She later confirmed that my ex said he wouldn't be able to make it so I agreed to go. \n\nI live in a different part of the state and she had other friends she'd invited from the area so I agreed to drive around 4 other girls to Nancy's birthday, stay the night, then come home the next evening. \n\nWe get there and everything is going great, dinner, birthday cake, pool party, at around half past midnight, my ex shows up. He kept his distance and didn't try to talk to me beyond an initial greeting but I felt awful and couldn't stand to be around there. \n\nI tried going to bed but I couldn't sleep and after about an hour, I told Nancy and the girls who'd carpooled with me that I would be leaving to return home. \n\nSince the girls had no way of getting back without me (besides public transport or a cab), they had to pack and leave with me too. Two of them have been completely understanding and say that I shouldn't have to be around someone I'm uncomfortable with, especially since I'd asked (and checked several times) if he would be coming.

That\u2019s frankly wise in the majority of situations (some rare exceptions may apply such as shared childcare and then distance is good).\n\nYou didn\u2019t make your friends leave. They absolutely could have taken a cab if they wanted to stay or talked to someone else there about getting a ride back. Breakups can be incredibly rough and even if they aren\u2019t it\u2019s a good idea to get as much distance as reasonably possible.", "NTA. When you get a ride with someone, you accept that you're going to be arriving and leaving on their schedule (unless you want to go with a cab or public transport, as you said). Even if he hadn't shown up, wanting to go home after midnight wouldn't be an asshole move. I would talk to Nancy about it -- ask her why he showed up, etc -- before drawing any conclusions about what she thinks.", "That was a reasonable response on your part. I might not have chosen to venture on a trip like that based on \u201che says he\u2019s not coming\u201d as opposed to \u201che\u2019s not invited\u201d, but you did, and then he was there, and you\u2019re no contact for whatever reason (not necessarily relevant here) so you left.\n\nI mean, you were there past midnight. Past 1:30, it sounds like. You were there for a lot of party. I think it\u2019s totally reasonable to not want to stay under the same roof as someone you\u2019re no contact with. That\u2019s not what you signed up for when you agreed to come. It\u2019s explicitly what you were avoiding, in fact.\n\nNAH", "From your description, it sounds like you stayed at the party for a few hours, so you fulfilled your commitment of going. You also mentioned the other gals had other options to get home, so NTA there either. Finally it doesn\u2019t sound like you like made a scene, so NTA.\n\nYour friends need to learn that when you rely on someone else for a ride, you occasionally have to leave at a time you didn\u2019t choose", "NTA- If you checked multiple times and Nancy told you that he wasn\u2019t going to be there and you two had a mutual understanding of that then yes, you\u2019re NTA for leaving because you\u2019re uncomfortable. Nancy should have respected your boundaries or, at least, given you a head\u2019s up.", "NTA. You took every possible step to ensure that you didn't end up in this situation and you have every right to leave a party when the circumstances change - especially considering you were pretty clear about not wanting to be there in those circumstances. Regardless of everyone wanting you to pretend like everything is fine and not disrupt things, you have every right to set that boundary and stick to it.", "He avoided you\u2026 why were you uncomfortable", "YTA. Here is how it reads to me: He avoided you and you decided you couldn't bare to be ignored and threw a tantrum and left. You could have easily gone to bed (you had).
