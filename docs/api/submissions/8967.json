We've been working on reducing our meat intake together and replacing it with vegetarian/vegan meals due to concerns about animal welfare and the environment. \n\nRecently, she has been getting into femininity accounts on instagram. She's wanted to be a housewife for a while but now she's started talking about how women should serve and be submissive to their husbands. She says career women are 'tapping into masculine energy', and are destined to be old and miserable living with cats. She's started talking poorly about sex workers and calling women who show skin 'degenerate'. We've always planned to have 2-3 kids but now she keeps saying she wants to have as many as possible. I don't want that many children, even one is a lot of work and I don't think she understands that. She's also started purchasing steak and beef liver, telling me how it's the ultimate superfood. That makes me uncomfortable because we'd previously phased out red meat. She cooked liver a few nights ago and I didn't want to have any but she put a lot of effort into it so to be nice I tried a little. I've never had beef liver before, and it tasted disgusting. I could tell she was struggling with it too but she swore it was the key to health. \n\nNot only that but she's started sending me posts from right wing masculinity accounts so I can 'lead her into her femininity'. I don't even know what that means, but I can't stand the blatant misogyny and rigid gender roles these accounts spew. I told her to stop sending me these but she kept doing it anyways. \n\nLast evening when I got off work I checked my insta dms while taking the bus home and saw that she sent me TEN reels from these 'traditional masculinity' accounts back to back. I got fed up and when I got home I told her that if she doesn't stop sending me these I'm going to block her on instagram. She got really offended and after some back and forth she said she's only doing it to help me become a better man. I told her I like myself the way I am and that if she wasn't \"terminally online\" she would too and wouldn't be so easily influenced by social media. She called me an AH and told me if I paid attention to what she sends me I wouldn't be such a \"soyboy\". She then stormed out of the house and still isn't back.

All this is just fairytales.", "Sorry but when I die I don't think a random reddit commenter from 60 years ago will be the first thing on my mind", "Perhaps you're right, but it doesn't change the fact that I want my wife, not someone who is a live-in servant", "How am I a chud for not wanting her to be subservient to me", "Please try not to let her drop out of school! Counseling will hopefully help, too.", "That's good. People are harping on your ages and in other contexts I'd maybe agree, but these are genuinely toxic communities that prey on vulnerable people. It's not normal growing-apart-because-age and I hope she can be swayed away from this.", "Good luck man, I am in college and looking at this stuff for my research. As a young (liberal) woman who struggles with mental health I have to give myself breaks from it.  Hope she deconstructs.", "yeah, can't blame you.  she's like Andrea Tate and your dick probably receding into your body at this point...", "Jesus fuck. This is terrifying.", "Oh. Oh no. This is bad.", "OP please please please confide in someone. This is so disturbing and I really don\u2019t want to hear about you on any of the Murder Podcast I listen to.", "Omg op is def gonna get murdered:(", "Idk what's creepier, the gf or how cavalier this guy is in the comments on that post.", "That sounds like a completely different issue entirely. Makes it hard to believe this isn't a BS post.", "Marriage comes with definite benefits in the US, so that certainly is one factor to it", "I suppose because I ran away from home to live with him at 25. They'd just given up on me \ud83e\udd23", "It might be that she just went down this pipeline randomly, it happens (especially with how algorithms push certain narratives quite aggressively if you engage with them even once)- but it might be worth exploring if she feels like she won\u2019t succeed in uni and has therefore tried to find another thing she feels she can succeed at (being a home maker) and started taking it to an extreme \u2026 good luck dragging her out of that right wing fever dream!", "Why would god stop free will? Wouldn\u2019t he be the devil if forced anything upon anyone?", "I guess that remains to be seen. Until then keep embracing the lies the media and government tell you to keep you in the blind.", "I find it ironic that you never asked what it is that I know that is so solid it can be proven as much as the grass is green. Someone who rejects the truth will always live a life of chains.", "I don\u2019t blame you. Might be time to have a serious coming to god conversation with her", "Man, I read your other posts. Your wife is absolutely psychotic and unhinged.", "No Im saying that she wants a chud, not calling you one", "Yeah I definitely won't, she hasn't talked about dropping out so far but if she mentions it I'll do everything in my power to convince her not to", "I'm going to try my best because that's exactly what they do, they spew propaganda to prey on people. She's not the first nor the last person this will happen to.", "Thank you! I hope so too, more than anything. I'm worried about her.", "That might be the case and it's something I'll have to discuss with her. Thank you!", "You know how many suffering people have prayed to god and he just ignored them in the name of \"free will\"? That's evil in and of itself. If I have a little bit less free will but my suffering is reduced and I'm not even aware I have less of it I'd rather take that.", "I definitely don't believe a thing the media or government tells me. Keep making assumptions mate", "Because I have a feeling it'll be more conspiracy stuff. But go on, what do you know?", "Ohhhh sorry I misinterpreted.

I wish you the best of luck.", "he's fine to be around when he or his wife aren't talking about hunter biden china money.\n\nhe has an 8th grade education but is street smart and good with his hands, so he gets by.  its no surprise he fell for it.  his take on abortion was that everyone should get one mulligan, which was more liberal than i expected tbh", "You\u2019re a good dude. Best of luck.", "If this life was more a vr simulation, would you feel bad for someone having to experience it? What if the person didn\u2019t know good from bad, had no concept of bad, and they wanted to know what it was. What if they voluntarily came here on their own free will to experience a life to know for themselves? Our leaders of the world believe in it, the proof of existence lies within their will power to do so much to control our experiences. The proof is in the \u201cgender\u201d now if you want to know anything past this, get off your high horse and actually listen. But if you don\u2019t care then, let it go, continue on.", "Yes, I would. I would feel bad for anyone who has to experience this shithole. I'm sure even then the person would understand pain, and they'd be in for a lot of it here. If they came of their own free will I'd say they're insane. \n\nAre you saying the world is a simulation?", "You truly should be worried. I've read some of these manuals back in the 90s!!! saying if your husband wants to do a threesome, cooperate wholeheartedly,  even if you don't like it.

She can\u2019t have it both ways.", "It's also terrible if you get sick from it if you are pregnant and giving it to kids is a HARD no. Maybe use that?", "I don\u2019t feel bad. The bad is what makes us good, a true choice of our own. To be above it. I have real proof of the deception. I\u2019ll just wait for you to ask. The deception is real. Our souls are on the line to repeat this until the end of eternity if we don\u2019t overcome it. This is a true opportunity to see the world for what it is and I can put it on a platter for you. Something that took me years to uncover. Thousands of hours. You can learn it all within a few hours and I\u2019d invest the time into teaching you. But you have to be the one to decide you want to take the blindfold off. The life we know is nothing more than the Truman show. It\u2019s fake.", "Fuck that, I don't want to do a threesome ever but that's horrendous, I can't believe they pumped out that rubbish. Luckily my wife isn't religious but I'm not even sure what draws her to this stuff, maybe the aesthetics", "Exactly, she'll have to pick one or the other. Can't wait to see what she'll choose.\n\nAlso I am impressed that you like liver, I could never."]}
