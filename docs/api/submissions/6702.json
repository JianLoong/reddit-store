They have tried to hide it over the years, but for almost all of my (26f) life it has been made perfectly clear that my parents care more about my sister. They know her favorite food, favorite color, favorite band and generally things you're supposed to know about the people you are very close to/family. But they have always tended to forget mine and just give me my sister's favorite things. Other family members have pointed it out to them. My grandpa, who was the best to me growing up, called them out in front of everyone on more than one occasion for it. Like when I was 8 and they had a birthday dinner with my sister's favorite dinner instead of mine. Grandpa was like wth is this, why did you make sister's favorite instead of Away's. My parents were all flustered and said it was just a silly mix up. I'd say of the 16 birthday dinners I had with them, 15 of them were my sister's favorites and not mine. The 16th one was only right because grandpa forced his way into the kitchen to help that year. I was always a gamer and a reader. My sister loved makeup and dolls. My birthday/Christmas gifts were often makeup and dolls. When people used to ask them what I wanted to be they'd say what my sister wanted to be. I have brought up to them on multiple occasions that it hurts my feelings but they never change. So I started to become more distant from my parents and don't make the effort I used to.\n\nMy sister has acknowledged that she's aware of this stuff. But she still wanted me to help her throw a party for their anniversary and to go half with her on this really expensive gift she wants to get them. She told me about it over Christmas. The anniversary is in April. She wanted to go all out but I told her I'm not doing anything that big to celebrate them and will not be putting all that effort in when they never make it with me. She told me that this would be helping her too. I told her she wants me to help her celebrate the people who show clear favoritism between their kids. She doesn't see the big deal. We argued. She told me I was being childish and that I'm unfair to her/them. She told me if I don't help with the party and the gift I am publicly shaming our parents and leaving it all on her shoulders.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673089621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105mjj9/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_sister_throw_a_party/", "score": 560, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How would it \"shame\" your parents for you not to participate in the organization of an anniversary party? Maybe it would shame them if you made a big to-do about refusing to participate/attend because of their mistreatment, but it sounds like your sister is trying to strong-arm you into doing something you have no obligation to do, but would help her out enormously.\n\nIt's okay to feel grief at the way you were treated & you do not have to \"get over\" it as your sister expects. It would not be good if you allowed your justified anger at their mistreatment to bubble out into this planned celebration. It would be worse if you agreed to help your sister, then used this as an opportunity to extract payback (like deliberately choosing foods or music your grandpa would have liked, but they won't), or to try to downrank them by playing the martyr.

Its not childish to protect yourself and mental health.", ">I told her she wants me to help her celebrate the people who show clear   \nfavoritism between their kids. She doesn't see the big deal\n\nOf course she doesn't. SHE'S the one being favored\n\n>She told me if I don't help with the party and the gift I am publicly shaming our parents\n\n...and?", "NTA. Give them your grandpa's favorite thing as a gift, make them taste their own medicine.", "NTA and whatever you did do to help out, she would get all the credit for anyway", "NTA. Your parents SHOULD be shamed publicly. In all your years, they never took the time to find out what you like. They deserve no grace from you. Hell, they\u2019re lucky you still haven\u2019t gone no contact. Based on the way your sister is acting, its probably time to do so", "NTA. \nClearly this has nothing to do with sisterly bonding and family, but rather all about money. And you can bet your sweet tootie that Sis will take all the credit or parents will give sis all the credit for the party and gift of their dreams from the daughter of their dreams.", "NTA. Also,  if your sister was aware of the favoritism, she could have said something to your parents.", "Nta\n\nBut this is celebrating their marriage not their parenting ability.\n\nYou don't like your parents, fair enough, no reason to do anything extravagant for them.", "Nta she\u2019s never going to get it you are wasting your breath to try and explain it to her. You need to just say no and accept her being upset. She\u2019s grown up her whole life as the favourite, she literally does not have the tools to see it from your perspective with your parents.", "NTA - You are not required to go along with your sister's plans period. It doesn't really matter the reason. That you have such a good one makes your sister a big AH for not getting it and being so manipulative about trying to force you into participating.", "get them tickets to ComicCon or a game you wanted.\n\nWhy would it be publicly shaming the parents?  surely they are comfortable with this because they havn't changed?\n\nNTA", "Don't go to it. Don't spend a dime on it. Not even a card.\n\nYou have self respect. keep your money and don't waste your time. Make up an excuse if you have to Covid is a good one.  I read 'Go NC' a lot here, I certainly would. This has infuriated me.\n\nShame on them. \n\nI wish you all the best of everything.", "NTA \u2026 and you should have your favourite meal for dinner\u2026.", "Tell your sister public shaming is a natural result of being terrible parents. And they should be ashamed. NTA", "NTA - u reap what u sow", "NTA.  I wouldn't even go to the celebration.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd say contribute AND make it a video gaming party and say \"Ooops, a slight mixup\"", "Please make them grandpa's favorite dish for the party! NTA", "I mean not being there favourite doesn't mean you weren't loved and supported.", "Disagree.\n\nSis had a wonderful idea and you really should listen to her.\n\n>I am publicly shaming our parents and leaving it all on her shoulders.\n\nYou should ABSOLUTELY do **that**. Like make a toast lmao. \" to my parents, who never took the time to find out what i liked\" \n\n(Dont really do it lmao)\n\nBut more seriously why should you help her in any shape or form when it seems she never tried to make your parents respect you. Did she ever call them out? Or is she just swimming in the pool of favoritism?\n\nNTA", "And make sisters favorite meal for dinner.", "Agree with this.  The parents, like many do, can throw a party to celebrate their 30th anniversary themselves.  You can buy them a gift if you like.\n\nI went through this with my spouse's family.  My parents would throw parties to celebrate their 75th/80th/85th etc - as they got older I was the behind-scenes-coordinator.  But they were the hosts.\n\nMy SIL, who lives with her parents and hasn't work much in the past 30 years (maybe a total of 3 years tops) would want to throw elaborate parties for her parents.  But because she had no money, she'd say we had to divide it in 5: 1/5th for her, 2/5ths for me and her brother and 2/5ths for her sister and BIL.\n\nPretty sneaky and transparent.  She wanted to be the hero and arranged everything at little cost to her.\n\nHer parents always had a lot more money than mine did, btw.  But they didn't like to spend it.\n\nNTA.  And sorry you don't feel valued.  That's hurtful.  Your parents effed up.", "NTA - or you can ask them: when are THEY throwing their anniversary party. And conveniently be on vacation with booked tickets and reservations", "Get them video games. Play dumb. \u201cI thought we just got each other whatever we want\u201d", "OP, see this. You will be pissed when this happens.", "Sadly her sister wouldn\u2019t care. I have a sister just like this (but mine is 5 years younger). They like being the favorite child", "People like you put the effort of reconciliation on the abused party and blame them for not taking the high road instead of putting the blame on the abusers. You are as bad as the abusers, and you should be shamed for it.\n\nRunning away from the problem? No. It is cutting toxic waste out of your life. Based on the things you said here: victim blaming, slippery slope logic, high-horsing, flip-flop around the issue, I guess dozens of people have cut you out of their life and move on in peace.", "Damn, what a dumb take this is.", "Minimum support, enough to show people that they have another child and not neglect them. That is bare minimum of parenting.\n\nMinimum love, 1/16 times, actually less than 1/16 since it is grandparent help.\n\nAt this point, they are better than the worst, and that is not a compliment. Even animal parents are doing better than them. My dogs are doing a better job of parenting than them.\n\nYour effort of defend asshole parents is so much badly done of a joke that no one can pity laugh on it.", "Seem like the sister only barely acknowledged the favoritism and continued to enable the parents and have neve respect OP's boundary. It is not worth to continue the relationship at this point.\n\nThe ball is in sister's court, if they want to have a relationship with OP, then they need to respect them and deal with the issue herself. It is not the OP's job to continue the relationship which yield basically nothing but problems.", "Op nta just forget about them and love your best life celebrate ur grandpa though he is real one", "I love how your brain works", "You're getting my award of the day, just a sec xD", "This is the way", "I love how your brain works", "This is the way!", "\"to grandpa, who has always been more of a parent to me than you two\"\n\n(Don't actually do this)", "OP - you aren't \"leaving it all on her shoulders\". It is her choice to throw a party and buy an expensive gift. You are not responsible for her choices. \n\nI have asked my sister to go halfsies on gifts before. Sometimes she does. Other times, she says that isn't spending that much for this person/event/occasion. No hard feelings. I will either pay for the entire gift myself or pick out something else.", "So, it's not really standing up. More like a pat in the back, but she didn't do anything to make an unfair situation right. \n\nDefinitely NTA OP. Blaming the person who suffered from discrimination is not okay. What your parents did was not okay. And what your sister said to you is not okay. None of their bad behavior is your fault.", "You're an adult now and don't have to put up with their favouritism.
