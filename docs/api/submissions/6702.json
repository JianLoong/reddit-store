They have tried to hide it over the years, but for almost all of my (26f) life it has been made perfectly clear that my parents care more about my sister. They know her favorite food, favorite color, favorite band and generally things you're supposed to know about the people you are very close to/family. But they have always tended to forget mine and just give me my sister's favorite things. Other family members have pointed it out to them. My grandpa, who was the best to me growing up, called them out in front of everyone on more than one occasion for it. Like when I was 8 and they had a birthday dinner with my sister's favorite dinner instead of mine. Grandpa was like wth is this, why did you make sister's favorite instead of Away's. My parents were all flustered and said it was just a silly mix up. I'd say of the 16 birthday dinners I had with them, 15 of them were my sister's favorites and not mine. The 16th one was only right because grandpa forced his way into the kitchen to help that year. I was always a gamer and a reader. My sister loved makeup and dolls. My birthday/Christmas gifts were often makeup and dolls. When people used to ask them what I wanted to be they'd say what my sister wanted to be. I have brought up to them on multiple occasions that it hurts my feelings but they never change. So I started to become more distant from my parents and don't make the effort I used to.\n\nMy sister has acknowledged that she's aware of this stuff. But she still wanted me to help her throw a party for their anniversary and to go half with her on this really expensive gift she wants to get them. She told me about it over Christmas. The anniversary is in April. She wanted to go all out but I told her I'm not doing anything that big to celebrate them and will not be putting all that effort in when they never make it with me. She told me that this would be helping her too. I told her she wants me to help her celebrate the people who show clear favoritism between their kids. She doesn't see the big deal. We argued. She told me I was being childish and that I'm unfair to her/them. She told me if I don't help with the party and the gift I am publicly shaming our parents and leaving it all on her shoulders.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673089621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105mjj9/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_sister_throw_a_party/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is nice if you can afford it and if you have a good relationship with them, but not a given.\n\nYour sister calling you unfair when it was your parents showing clear favoritism is laughable. Did your sister ever stand up for you? Not that it was her role, but it would have been nice. Her behavior in this situation is really selfish (it's about what she wants and what your parents want, disregarding what you want once again).", "NTA, and I'm surprised you're still keeping in touch with them. You aren't obliged to give your parents anything just because they made you. I hope you are surrounded by better people now.", "NTA she\u2019s the favorite child she doesn\u2019t care/understand the hurt at all. You shouldn\u2019t help with anything that has to do with either of them. You are not doing anything wrong. Don\u2019t let her guilt you.", "NTA. You are not required to do anything. Period. Yes they are your parents, but it\u2019s been clear all your life, and not to just you, that you were always number 2. I would not split the costs financially at all. If she wants help maybe offer to help set some things up, but I don\u2019t feel like you need to go all out for people who never did for you.", "NTA. Ask them what they want and do the opposite.\n\nSeriously, your sister knows that she will get all of the attention for doing this. All she wants is for you to help to fund her big moment with them.", "NTA. I think you feel neglected in your childhood and that is a valid feeling. If you don\u2019t want to contribute than don\u2019t.", "NTA.  If I were you I won't even bother with **any** gifts nor would I bother show up for the party.", "NTA.

Your Grampa sounds like he is awesome", "NTA - Your parents sound horrible, I am so sorry. You should not feel guilty not wanting to give back to people with this much disrespect to their own child.

Your parents will brag it and says its from your sister", "NTA. You owe your family nothing. The good thing is that you can *choose* your family now. Stay in contact with those who are good to you, leave out the toxic ones, and choose from among your friends a new set of family members to fill in the blanks, so to speak. Chosen families are a great gift.", "NTA don't let your sister guilttrip you into it. She wants to throw a BIG party? She gets all the responsibility and credits. You don't even have to attent. Or maybe go to talk to the family who do you good. I so hope your grandfather is still alive. Keep your grandfather in mind everytime you have trouble making decisions. \n\nEven if your grandfather is deceased. My deceased MIL came through supporting me during the divorce saying she wasn't proud of how her son was treating me at the time. You buckle up and remind them what your grandpa said and did for you and how they refused to learn. You don't owe your sister or parents anything.", "NTA honestly i\u2019d go a level of petty and get them something you\u2019d know they don\u2019t like and say \u2018but i thought this was your favorite kind of thing\u2019 with a sweet smile. bonus points if you do it in front of family who would get what you\u2019re playing at. other than that go no contact with your sister and parents it\u2019s clear you\u2019re not even a thought to them.", "NTA- they clearly don't care that much about you if they can't even bother to know the very basics about you so why should you care about them? If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't help with the party or the gift, but for ANY gift giving occasion, I'd start giving them gifts that they absolutely would hate or that only someone else they know like your sister would love and if they called you on it, I'd say it must have just been a mix up.... Just like they do.", "There is no way you\u2019re wrong here. Your parents couldn\u2019t even be bothered to know who you are, what your interests are, what food you like. This level of favouritism absolutely sucks. They made literally no effort during your childhood. If your sister wants to throw a party, fine. You do not have to be involved in any way. Not for any reason. \n\nIt\u2019s easy for your sister to say you\u2019re wrong because she didn\u2019t have to spend her whole life feeling like second best.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t want to put that much thought and effort into people who seemingly have no interest in me.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a British thing but as far as I\u2019m aware kids don\u2019t really get involved in parents anniversaries beyond an acknowledgment with a card and flowers or other smallish token. To me an anniversary is something special between the partners.\n\nI get 30 is a milestone but still.", "Don't do it, your parents do not deserve you and your Grandpa knew it. Stay away/go low contact from the sister and parents. It's just unforgivable what they have done to you.", "NTA, i understand why you did nothing.", "NTA publicly shame your parents harder. I don't think this is a big enough slap in the face. Doubt they'd notice anyway though.", "NTA- and I have a feeling if you did chip in they would only thank your sister for the expensive gift", "NTA, but if you want to get truly petty and burn all the bridges in a spectacular fire, you could offer to pay for catering g and DJ, then order a menu of entirely your favourite food (with not even a nod to theirs) and ask the DJ to play exclusively your favourite music (with explicit instructions not to play anything they enjoy).", "NTA - You should be able to say you're happy for them that they are celebrating an important anniversary, but since you don't have a good relationship with them, you're not interested in being involved in the celebration.   \n\nIf your sister tries again with the guilt trip about helping her, you tell her this isn't a party for her, it's a party for your parents you don't have a good relationship with, so again don't want to be involved.   But thanks for thinking of including me.", "NTA you parents are the AH and your sister too for allowing their behaviour and actions. \n\nThe trauma you must have from having to grow up like this is awful. Being a forgotten child is never nice but the fact your parents have been called out multiple times by multiple people and still don't change is awful. \n\nIf your sister wants to get them the gift your sister should know how to save.", "NTA. How would it \"shame\" your parents for you not to participate in the organization of an anniversary party? Maybe it would shame them if you made a big to-do about refusing to participate/attend because of their mistreatment, but it sounds like your sister is trying to strong-arm you into doing something you have no obligation to do, but would help her out enormously.\n\nIt's okay to feel grief at the way you were treated & you do not have to \"get over\" it as your sister expects. It would not be good if you allowed your justified anger at their mistreatment to bubble out into this planned celebration. It would be worse if you agreed to help your sister, then used this as an opportunity to extract payback (like deliberately choosing foods or music your grandpa would have liked, but they won't), or to try to downrank them by playing the martyr. Your tactic of refusing to get involved seems like the best choice here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
