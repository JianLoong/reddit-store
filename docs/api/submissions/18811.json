I hadn't seen her in about a year due to her accepting a job in a different country. During the wedding, I met most of the guests there for the first time. I ended up hooking up with one of the groomsmen after the wedding. It later turned out that he was the groom's brother, and he was actually married. I had no knowledge of this at the time, and if I had known, I never would have gotten involved with him. His wife, Leah, filed for divorce when she found out.\n\nFast forward to now, my friend is pregnant, and I helped organize a baby shower for her. However, she has recently uninvited me from the baby shower because Leah has got back together with her husband and feels uncomfortable with me being there. This decision deeply upset me because I didn't intentionally help Leah's husband have an affair, and I assumed my friend would understand and support me rather than banning me from the celebration to protect Leah's feelings. Feeling hurt, I canceled the cake I had ordered for the baby shower and returned the gift I had purchased for her. She is now accusing me of ruining her baby shower.

She uninvited you - did she really still expect you to provide the cake still? Holy entitled. \n\nYou did nothing to Leah. You had no idea the groomsman, her husband, was married. It sounds like Leah blames you because it\u2019s easier than blaming her husband. But baby showers have plenty of people - if Leah really had a problem with you (even though you did nothing to her), she could ignore you or just not show up. \n\nLeah and your former BFF are meant to be friends. Good freakin\u2019 riddance. I\u2019m sorry, OP. You deserve better than these people.", "NTA. I find it kinda funny \ud83d\ude04 \nImagine thinking you owe her something after kicking you out of something you helped organize. The entitlement is real. No one likes baby showers anyway she\u2019ll get over it, I wouldn\u2019t stay friends with her though.", "Did your former bestie not invite her sister in law to her wedding ?\n\nNTA. Why would you bring a cake to a party you've been uninvited to ?  That family needs to learn how to blame the people who are actually responsible for their woes.", "NTA Your invitation to the shower was rescinded. Why on earth your friend still thought you'd buy a cake and send a gift is beyond me.", "If you are uninvited, your gifts are uninvited as well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your friend is an asshole over the cake but I understand her problem. She's been forced to choose between you and her extended family and understandably she picked family.\n\nBecause the brother-in-law and the wife reconciled you can never be invited to a single event that either of them might be at. No kids birthdays, no parties, no summer cookouts. I hate to say it but I think your friendship is over.", "NTA. Cancelling the cake is not the same as ruining the shower and it's not reasonable to expect you to contribute to a shower you're not invited to.", "Lol NTA. If your friend uninvited you then you don\u2019t have any responsibility for that shit. That\u2019s a big fat r/leopardsatemyface moment for your friend.", "NTA\n\n\"YOU ARE NOT COMING TO THE SHOWER - But I still expect cake and a present\"\n\nI  can sort of understand pacifying her SIL and uninviting you, but she cant expect you to still provide the cake - that is acting so entitled.", "Hi.... NTA.    She should be writing asking us if she ITA.    Sorry you are going thru this.", "NTA bc why are they ignoring the fact that he willingly hooked up with you despite the fact that he knows he\u2019s married. they are treating you like you were the one who made the wrong decision. good thing you cancelled the cake cause clearly your friend chose to side with the cheater than her own friend. I wouldve cancelled it too", "100% NTA.", "NTA, why should you still provide and cake and a gift if you\u2019re no longer invited?", "NTA. You are not the asshole, but they\u2019re making you a scapegoat. It takes two to tango, and he was the homewrecker - not you. It\u2019s nice that they\u2019re back together, but not at your expense.\n\nWhy should you provide a cake and a gift when you\u2019ve been uninvited? What did she think would happen, you\u2019d smile and shell out three figures for cake and gift while bowing and scraping your way out of the venue where you\u2019re unwanted? The entitlement is ridiculous. You can find better friends.", "NTA. \n\nAs I see her point why she is uninviting you - although you are her friend, Leah is family if she is getting back together with her (ex)husband. And it doesn't sound like you have a really good relationship with your so called best friend if you haven't seen her for years and don't know her circle of friends/family\n\nBut it is completly okay for you to cancle the cacke and returning the gifts after the spontan uninvitation. You will not be there and your present will make someone unconfortable, so why should you send presants or a cake?", "NTA, for reasons everyone else has already commented.\n\nThe only thing I'd like to add to the discussion regarding choosing Leah over you: I'd be a lot more understanding of your best friend if the brother/Leah had children. If there are kids, the \"OP or Leah\" argument probably becomes \"OP or Leah and nieces/nephews\", and that is a more challenging ultimatum for your friend to issue.", "NTA\n\nBut even if you didn\u2019t know he was married, it\u2019s still an understandably uncomfy situation for Leah. You are just a human, true.

Your friend is a user - she uninvited you as her guest. You uninvited the cake as your +1. It\u2019s simple math. The fact that she had you organise the party and dropped you is a sign - a sign that your friendship is over.", "I guess your friend wanted to have the cake and eat it too...*badum tiss*\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m close to N A H on this one, but your friend getting pissed that you no longer are providing a gift or cake makes me go NTA.\n\nRegarding being uninvited, sometimes things suck, it\u2019s not your fault, but the consequences fall on you. Through no fault of your own, you are and will always be The Affair Partner to Leah, and you can\u2019t expect her to be ok with you. If she\u2019s at an event, you won\u2019t be.", "NTA  and that's nonsense, I can't imagine she was unaware they were reconciling or that Leah would have an issue. This is not your fault it's the BIL's, he knew he was married and didn't disclose that to you. But I do think your friend is in a bad spot and is being forced to choose sides, I feel bad for you both. Your friend is being dramatic, she can order another cake.", "NTA, I would have taken back everything I got for the party, Leah can throw the shower. Your friend should have never let you organize it if this was going to be a problem", "NTA - you shouldn't be expected to provide for a party you've been uninvited to. That's not a real friend.", "Did you pay for the cake? And did you inform her it was canceled? \n\nIf you paid for the cake and told her \u201cok if I am not invited then I will not be investing my resources into this\u201d you are 100% justified. If leah is such an important part of the celebration she can plan and pay for those things. \n\nBut if you canceled a cake someone else bought just cause you could yeah thats a bit a-holery. And its just kinda mean to not tell anyone the cake was canceled cause it doesnt give them a chance to reorder something and that\u2019s just petty. So the answer to if you are an A-hole very much depends on the answer to these two questions.\n\nRegardless, the first A-hole move was your friend uninviting you considering you put time into helping her plan it so I understand being hurt by this and im sorry it happened.", "Hey, I have to uninvite you to my shower. Can you still supply the cake and give me my gift? GTFOH!", "NTA. I get that there are some tricky dynamics to navigate, but none of them are your fault. At the end of the day, your friend and her husband chose the cheating groomsman over you.

You helped and if she\u2019s going to uninvite you, then she doesn\u2019t need the things YOU spent YOUR money on.

The fact that Leah can forgive her husband (who knew that he was married) vs. you (innocent stranger who did not know that man was married) and is uncomfortable with you is ridiculous.

I've been to a few weddings and didn't know who tf the groomsmen are to the groom beside friends.", "Been to lots of weddings both as a guest and bridesmaid, I don't remember reading one ever actually, so either lots of weddings don't have them or they are easy to miss.", "Clumsy bugger"]}
