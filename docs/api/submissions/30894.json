We said hi, gave it some pats, and got in our car to leave. \n\nI carefully backed out to ensure not hitting the dog and I saw he was pooping in my yard.

I grabbed a garden spade and just flung it over into my neighbor\u2019s yard. \n\nHe just texted me the video clip of me doing that from his security camera and said, \u201cReal neighborly\u201d.
