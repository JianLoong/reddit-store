{"id": 25111, "submission_id": "15wi2ov", "title": "AITA for not telling my wife just how much my late wife left our children?", "selftext": "I was married to Sammy for 8 years and we had two children together Delaney (now 18f) and Finn (now 17m). Sammy had been born with a serious heart defect that was left undiagnosed for many years. It was during her pregnancy with our daughter where she learned about this, though some health issues over her life had been a sign, that was ignored by doctors. During her pregnancy with our son she went into total heart failure and between one thing or another, she realized she would not get another heart in time. Sammy came into money a few years before her death. We had always talked about that going toward our kids college expenses. When she realized it was unlikely she would live long enough to see them past kindergarten and first grade, she asked me how I would feel about her parents being in charge of the money.\n\nMy family are not good people and our concern was always, if the money was left with me and something happened to me, my family would find a way to get their greedy paws on it. They would have spent that money without a second thought for their grandchildren/niece/nephew and in all likelihood would have left them with nothing. So I said yes. Sammy's death came way too soon but she was peaceful in the end.\n\nFour years later I met my current wife Nat and after a two year relationship we got married. Nat has two girls who are 14 and 12. When Nat and I sat down to discuss finances, college funds, etc, I told her that Sammy had left our kids some money, never disclosing exactly how much, and just mentioned that we would not need to save for the kids college. It was different with her girls. Her ex, their father, had stolen the money Nat saved for the girls. So we started saving together. But it was not a lot.\n\nWhen Delaney told me she wanted to go to college and that she was strongly considering community college, I sat both her and Finn down and told them about the money. I told her it was not to pressure her but if she wanted to go away for college, there was money available. Delaney chose to keep the money for a house in the future and Finn mentioned he would likely do the same with his share.\n\nDelaney mentioned it in front of Nat over the summer and Nat was confused by her comment about it buying a house. She asked how much money it was and she was furious with me when Delaney told her. She said I should have disclosed just how much my kids had access to. I asked her why, it was their money, it was nothing to do with her. She said I was too vague and I should trust her as my wife. This has been a tension between us since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692554160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wi2ov/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_just_how_much_my/", "score": 10483, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now she is aware of how much and feels I was an asshole for hiding it from her. The reason I feel this might make me TA is because she feels like I did not trust her.

Imagine having to split your saving between 4 kids, not 2.", "1) the money did not originate with you\n\n2) you have no access to the money\n\n3) your children with your late wife\n\n4) Absolutly ZERO to do with wife #2 and her children she brought with her into the marriage\n\n5) NTA see 1-4\n\nEDiT: Thanks for the award & upvotes", "NTA\n\nYour late wife\u2019s gifts to her children are neither your current wife\u2019s business nor concern.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your money, it belongs to your children. The money is unrelated to her.", "NTA. It has nothing to do with her. Sounds like she's more pissed that she's not getting any of it for her kids.", "If twas enough money to fully pay for college then it should be enough money to buy a house, right?\n\nAnd if it's not house-buying kind of money, then it might not have been enough to pay for college. And if that's the case, then Nat was pretty comfortable with you two saving for college for her daughters and not contributing anything to your older kids' college fund. Knowing that they would need the money years before her kids did. That's concerning. \n\nAnd since she took your word for it that the money was enough for their college, then she shouldn't now get mad coz it never occurred to her that the money was so much. What difference does it make? She knew there was money. She knew it was enough for college. Unless she's mad that she doesn't have access? Or that her kids can't get a share?\n\nNTA\n\nEdited.\n\nEdit: I could be wrong but I think your wife is mad that the money isn't going to her kids. And coz she doesn't want to seem greedy, she's making you out to be the bad guy. And making up a reason as to why you are the bad guy.", "NTA - Money was there before your current wife, allocated for a specific reason. \n\nHer reaction is probably because she wanted some of that money for her children's college.", "NTA, why would the amount matter? It\u2019s for your son and daughter, from your late wife. You don\u2019t even oversee the account.", "NTA, it doesn't matter how much was left to Sammy's kids, it was left to them to spend for college and beyond. Her excuse about trust is not valid, it wasn't like you didn't disclose that the KIDS had some money. Next she will be saying you should share it with the other kids, that would be sh\\*tting on your wife's wishes.", "NTA. You said that you told her when discussing family finances when you got together that Sammy left the kids money, so saving for their college wasn\u2019t necessary.  That was sufficient.", "Nta. Her response is weird", "NTA. You disclosed they were left money for college. It doesn\u2019t sound like she asked and you were evasive. You just didn\u2019t offer the rest of the information. What would have changed if she knew the specifics? You didn\u2019t have access to the money or control of it, and you did immediately go into saving for her children who are still better off than they would have been without you in the picture.", "NTA. You are right: it's their money and nothing to do with her. Her argument is not on point and deflecting.", "NTA. Have you talked to the grandparents about the money recently? Is it still enough to pay for college or buy a house? Was it invested well?\n\nWhen you merged finances and told your current wife that you didn\u2019t have to worry about paying for your kids college because the grandparents were handling your first wife\u2019s estate, that was more than enough information. \n\nHow would the actual number have changed anything? You both decided not to save for your kids, which was a pretty risky proposition, she must have assumed the bequest was huge!", "Why does she need to know how much money your kids have? That seems shady to want to know, to me.", "NTA. Money does strange things to people. You are under no obligation whatsoever to provide a college education for your current wife\u2019s children but you have taken the extra step to help save for that. The money your late wife left for her children belongs to them, 100%. Your current wife\u2019s demands that she should\u2019ve known how much there was indicates to me, that she would have insisted part of that money go to her children. There will always be inequalities in step families. If her parents were to pass away and leave her children a large sum of money, would she offer to split that money between all of your combined children? Probably not.", "NTA. You shared that as a couple you did not need to save money for your kids. The two of you were able to put 100% of the saving effort towards her kids. If your late wife left $10k or $10 million had no bearing on you and your wife. It was not your money. It wasn\u2019t yours to split with her kids (which based on her reaction is what she would have wanted). It wasn\u2019t hers to put towards a home renovation instead of college expenses. It frankly had no impact on her life at all. \n\nI can understand if she wanted to prepare her kids for the differences. Hey X and Y\u2019s mom left them money when she passed away that their grandparents control. They will not need to worry about funding college but our circumstances are different so here\u2019s our plan. But remember this is money they got because their mom passed away. It\u2019s not something to be jealous of, it came to them for a really, really sad reason. But knowing they had college covered was enough to tell her she was going to need to have that talk with her kids. The account balance was never going to alter that.\n\nEditing to add: this is based on the assumption you\u2019re in the US. College costs are insane there. If you told your wife that your kids had money put aside that guaranteed their college was covered and you were therefore saving nothing for them then to me you\u2019ve told her it\u2019s a \u201clife changing\u201d amount of money. If she wanted details she should have asked at the time. If someone told me they had saved enough for college in the US I would never assume they meant they had only $25k for example.", "Absolutely not \u2026 the money was from their mom for her kids. You wife has no say and it\u2019s non of her business how much money and what is done with it. This is why money from a late spouse should be put into a trust for the wishes to be fulfilled.\n\nIt sounds like ur wife feels like she should have a say in what the $ is used for. It is not ur kids job to justify what the $ is for. I would completely shut that conversation down. She is lucky a step-father is willing to contribute to her kid\u2019s future.", "NTA her kids aren't entitled to your late wife's money", "Nta its money their mom left to them. There would have maybe been a point if it were your money, but it wasn't your just holding it for the time being until the rightful recipients are old enough to receive it", "NTA. My dad married a widow who had a large sum of money for her and her children due to her first husband dying at the hospital's fault. That money was for her kids, not my dad's kids. My dad provided many things for us, but we knew we wouldn't be getting free college and new cars on graduating like her kids would with their trust funds. \n\nMy brothers and I weren't upset about it. It was explained to us and we knew it wasn't an issue of favoritism, just that they had trust funds and we didn't. \n\nMy stepmother also graciously paid for many things that my parents couldn't afford for my brothers and I out of her share of the money and she always treated us with love and care. \n\nFor me, at least, I didn't feel the lack of care from anyone because everyone was open and honest and we knew the situation. \n\nCould she be worried that her daughters will feel like they're less important due to the disparity in funds? If so, all that is probably needed is an open and honest family conversation. In any case, your wife should be relieved and happy for your kids, not upset.\n\nI hope you can sort out the situation, but you are definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou shared that your children had a college fund which didn\u2019t need further contributions, this has allowed more money to be allocated to her children.

Don't feel guilty.", "NTA.\nI don't reckon she would like you discussing her finances with your children so why should you discuss THEIR finances with her? \nI think your wife thinks the money is somehow/somewhat yours and until it clicks that it's theirs and theirs alone, you may have the tension continue, its hard when you want the best for your kids especially after tough times, so it may take some time for her to process it and for it to click", "NTA. Their money has nothing to do with her.", "NTA - it is not your money and it is not your wife's business.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of her business. Her kids don\u2019t get it.

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. That money is for your and Sammy's children, and you don't have any control over it. Why does your wife think she needed to know specifics?

If it didn\u2019t matter then, why does it matter now? \n\nWould she have treated your children differently? Do they deserve to be treated differently because of this money?

My hypothesis is that Nat views it this way:\n\nMoney was left for older two girls\u2019 college. If they save on college by going to community college, then that money should go towards Nat\u2019s daughters\u2019 college expenses, not the older two girls buying their first houses. Because the money was for \u201ccollege\u201d not \u201canything.\u201d\n\nThis of course misses the ENTIRE bigger picture which is that 100% of the money is *for* the older two daughters. None of it should be used for Nat or her daughters.\n\nOP is a wise man who is doing right by his late first wife\u2019s wishes.", "It shouldn't make a difference to her how much it is. And OP didn't lie. It's none of her business. I don't get why people are saying she wanted transparency from OP. There's nothing to be transparent about. It's not your money. Neither OP or her will have anything to do with it. It's irrelevant information in my opinion. You are NTA but I feel your wife is acting like an AH and whatever her reasons are for feeling put out at not knowing the amount of money, they are not good. Jealousy, resentment and entitlement? Those are the three words that come to mind.", "NTA it isn\u2019t her money or your money and you were upfront that y\u2019all would need to save none for your kids and you\u2019ve been focusing on hers", "NAH - at this point.  It all depends on what Nat is exactly upset about. \n\nIf Nat thinks that your kids' money should be shared with her kids or with the two of you, then she is an AH.  \n\nIf she is upset because she thinks you are withholding information from her like her thieving ex, it may be a trust issue.  The discovery of the amount of your kids' money came from your daughter, not you, which may have pressed a button with her. It's just a gut reaction on her part that you two may not be as close as she thought or that you would think that she would expect any part of their money for her and her kids. She may be offended.\n\nThe only way to resolve this is to talk it through with her and ask her why she is so upset, is it a money issue or a trust issue?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t hide it, you were forthcoming and even stated that it belonged to the children. You didn\u2019t need to tell her what they have as it is nothing to do with her or you but belonged to your children as an inheritance from their mother. Beings that her family had control over it basically, you pretty much have nothing to do with it.\n\nMy concern is why is she all upset about it? You have been assisting her in providing for her children including college. That is more than enough and she should be content with that. However, I\u2019m beginning to believe that she wants access to the money now that she knows how much there is. Probably to use on her own children, which is wrong.\n\nA test to see how she really feels about you, if she moved into your home, tell her that the kids also are inheriting the house when you pass as it belonged to her as well. If she is upset with that, then you have your answer as to how she really feels about you.", "NAH. I see a lot of cynical interpretations of this here. I suspect she simply feels you do not trust her.", "Info : Did she say in so many words that since there was so much money, her girls should get some ?", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s got eyes on that money sorting out 4 kids my guy", "Feels like a little bit of jealousy creeping in from your wife .

You seem to have had a valid reason for sealing your lips. Also, money for a house and  college can be in the same category, so she had an inkling. Your wife has also had her troubles with bad people, so it should be okay with her that that kind of money is secure.", "NAH, just a wife that wants transparency from her husband and a husband who feels that his daughters' finances are theirs, not hers.

Another case of the martyr step father...", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need to count your kids bank accounts. Period. End of story.", "NTA. Your first wife left that money to HER kids and her parents are managing it. To be fair, I'm sure your kids would prefer to have their mom back instead of the money. But she wa sfortunate enough to be able to provide for them before she passed.\n\nThis has nothing to do with your current wife, you've even offered to help her save for her own kids to go to college so it's not like they're missing out completely. You told her there was money for you kids, so haven't hidden anything, that's the end of it.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your money. It\u2019s your kids\u2019 money. It\u2019s none of her business", "NTA. It's not even your money, so it's not like you were hiding a whole bank account. Your wife had the necessary information: no need to put aside money for your kids' educations. Beyond that, it's money from your late wife to her children.", "NTA.  I suspect she wants access to it.  Let her know it is not under your control at all.  Wow, be careful, she May feel entitled to it and start trying to manipulate you or your kids.", "NTA, your late wife\u2019s family has the money, and it\u2019s for Delaney and Finn.

You told her that you were not going to be putting any more money towards your kids' education and willingly saved up towards hers. That should be the thing standing out to her. You didn't have any obligation to do that either. How does something that you're late wife left to your kids concern her? It is my opinion that the only thing that would have changed by her knowing that information is her ability to try and get you to split it between them all, or trying to short change your kids on vacations, holidays and other life experiences because they had a leg up in life already and she was trying to make it even somehow. I know that sounds like a pessimistic viewpoint, but something very similar happened when my dad passed away and I really wish that the family member that had been left in charge of my unseen inheritance had kept it to themselves so that something that was meant for me and my future didn't get wasted on other people that it wasn't meant for.", "NTA. As you said, the money was from Sammy to your kids. Nat has absolutely no need to be involved in such conversations regarding the money. That trust comment from her is weird - it\u2019s not a matter of trust, it\u2019s not something she should be involved in, even if you were directly responsible for the money. I can understand her frustration of not being able to provide for her kids as much as she wants, but that has nothing to do with your late wife and children. I hope that she\u2019s able to move past this and doesn\u2019t try to ask for anything, as you\u2019ve already helped her out by contributing to her kids\u2019 funds and she\u2019s not entitled to anything in regards to your kids\u2019 maternal side.", "NTA!\n\nNotable: this was very well written and ease to understand.", "NTA - It\u2019s not yours or hers. It is not a matter of trust. Neither of you get to decide what to do with it, therefore the amount is moot. Good choice letting the grandparents manage the money. I have a feeling if it were left to you, Nat would expect you to divide it up differently than your late wife wished.", "Nta. The fact she is so keen on it shows it was wise not to tell her. It has nothing to do with her, she had no right to know.", "Dude your wife should be thankful you\u2019re willing to save for her kids. And how much money your kids have have nothing to do with her or her kids.", "NTA. \n\nThis money is not physically controlled by you. She just needed to know that you two did not have to save for your kids college fund.  End of story. She doesn't have to know the amount because that was between you, your late wife and the grandparents.  \n\nWhat she does need to be is grateful that you are  able to help fund, no matter the amount, her kids college. Without your late wife's inheritance to your children, you wouldn't be able to because you would be worrying about your kids college money.", "NTA\n \nYou don\u2019t even have control of this money.  Even if she wanted some for her kids you couldn\u2019t supply it.", "NTA, maybe NAH. Might be worthwhile having a more in-depth conversation about this, although I\u2019d proceed cautiously. Might be she\u2019s mad she can\u2019t get the money for her kids, might be she\u2019s hurt you didn\u2019t confide the amount. Some combination of money issues with her ex and you still holding on to information about your first marriage \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think you know enough right now to make a judgment either.\n\nEither way, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA-if she has a problem, let her know the money is in the hands of your late wife\u2019s parents, so not even you have access to it. It is solely your children\u2019s money. I\u2019m not sure if she asking them to share the money with her kids but if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a big no.", "NTA. Frankly it wasn\u2019t your information to give out. It\u2019s there inheritance from their mother that is controlled by their grandparents. If they wanted to share how much it was it was their choice. Also you told your wife the inheritance exists and that you didn\u2019t have to save money for college for the kids, which should have been an indicator it was a decent amount of money. Finally she didn\u2019t ask you how much. You\u2019re already going above and beyond by helping her save up for her girls college funds when that\u2019s not your responsibility. They have a father even if he\u2019s a deadbeat. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t help, but she should realize you don\u2019t have to and it\u2019s generous of you to do so.", "NTA.

Sammy had been born with a serious heart defect that was left undiagnosed for many years. It was during her pregnancy with our daughter where she learned about this, though some health issues over her life had been a sign, that was ignored by doctors. During her pregnancy with our son she went into total heart failure and between one thing or another, she realized she would not get another heart in time. Sammy came into money a few years before her death. We had always talked about that going toward our kids college expenses. When she realized it was unlikely she would live long enough to see them past kindergarten and first grade, she asked me how I would feel about her parents being in charge of the money.\n\nMy family are not good people and our concern was always, if the money was left with me and something happened to me, my family would find a way to get their greedy paws on it. They would have spent that money without a second thought for their grandchildren/niece/nephew and in all likelihood would have left them with nothing. So I said yes. Sammy's death came way too soon but she was peaceful in the end.\n\nFour years later I met my current wife Nat and after a two year relationship we got married. Nat has two girls who are 14 and 12. When Nat and I sat down to discuss finances, college funds, etc, I told her that Sammy had left our kids some money, never disclosing exactly how much, and just mentioned that we would not need to save for the kids college. It was different with her girls. Her ex, their father, had stolen the money Nat saved for the girls. So we started saving together. But it was not a lot.\n\nWhen Delaney told me she wanted to go to college and that she was strongly considering community college, I sat both her and Finn down and told them about the money. I told her it was not to pressure her but if she wanted to go away for college, there was money available. Delaney chose to keep the money for a house in the future and Finn mentioned he would likely do the same with his share.\n\nDelaney mentioned it in front of Nat over the summer and Nat was confused by her comment about it buying a house. She asked how much money it was and she was furious with me when Delaney told her. She said I should have disclosed just how much my kids had access to. I asked her why, it was their money, it was nothing to do with her. She said I was too vague and I should trust her as my wife. This has been a tension between us since.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did she assume OP was funding his children's accounts alone, and why that disparity was fine with her? Cause that is some selfish shitty thinking, and really hard to justify even with a lot of mental gymnastics. \n\nIf she is insistent the marriage is share and share alike, where is her concern about OPs kids educational fund? If OP and she had saved for her children and not his would she happily take from her kids to provide for OPs?

She's evil!\"", "And the word \"men\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting.", "OP is not keeping any financial secrets from his spouse.\n\nHe's even helping her save money for HER kids' college funds.  His kids' savings accounts have nothing to do with their marriage and nothing to do with the Stepmom.  \n\nIt's the same situation as if OP's kids' grandparents decided to give his kids money... it has nothing to do with OP's current wife.  Why is she upset about not knowing the amounts of accounts her husband has no access to and no control over?", "But she wasn\u2019t kept in the dark. She was just surprised by the large amount.", "Not sure she knows that. She probably just thinks it it's an account and they can withdraw it. I mean the husband and his previous wife talked about even keeping that money away from his family. They both really came through for their kids. And kudos to him for not betraying his kids for the new wife.", "They have been saving $0 towards school for OPs kids, so presumably OP and current wife have already been budgeting what they can afford for the 2 younger kids.", "So, let's say OP's late wife inherited $500k and left it to be split equally between  her kids (a substantial amount that nobody would feel the need to supplement).\n\nAre you seriously saying that OP is obligated to somehow come up with $250k for each of his stepkids in a few short years and without the benefit of inheriting a huge chunk of change from a long lost uncle? You're delusional.\n\nI had 3 seperate stepfathers growing up (the 4th was after I was done with college). None of them so much as paid for a pair of sneakers for me. OP is awesome for contributing and OP's wife had no issue with how much they were saving for her kids until the amount that had been left by OP's late wife was revealed. \n\nOP is awesome and his stepkids are lucky.", "Shared with his WIFE, but he isn't  responsible for the higher education costs of her kids.  Helping to save for them is a generous deed on his part, not an obligation.", "I wonder if dead beat bio dad is paying support? He should be made to support his kids. Maybe he is and the wife has been keeping that secret for years. I don't think she would willingly use that money to help care for all four kids.\n\nI hate that the Mrs. is putting everyones' relationships in question moving forward. If I were her, I would be so happy to be able to just worry about my own kids' future.  Would she be willing to share any inheritance that her kids may receive? I think not.", "See my mind jumped to maybe regretting some of their shared financial decisions. Op says that they do have a joint account that they both contribute to that funds the entire family. \n\nI wonder if the wife is now regretting agreeing to and funding some of the more expensive vacations, extracurriculars, even home renovations. Op says in another comment that because his kids college accounts are taken care of, he has focused on giving them a great childhood. I wonder if the wife has followed suit not knowing the discrepancy and now regrets giving the kids extra now when she could have been saving that for the future. \n\nSort of a \u2018you suggested we split a yearly family trip to Hawaii and I was good with that but now I know that you had your kids future secured and I wish I would have saved my portion of that money now for my kids future\u2019.", "She\u2019s probably just  embarrassed. I bought an apartment recently and my manager reacted badly to me getting one. Apparently she had been trying to buy a house and couldn\u2019t. She probably thought I was too young and poor to afford one. In this case the wife is angry and embarrassed that she can\u2019t provide for her kids the same way as her ex took the money. I don\u2019t think she thinks that it\u2019s her money in anyway. She\u2019s just triggered.", "I said exactly the opposite. That they should save what they can, and _not_ try to make it \"equal\"", "Try telling that to a court. Or the children's other,  real  parent. When you marry, you most assuredly do NOT agree to share children. \nYou have a moral obligation to treat them with kindness and civility. as one would with anyone. but it stops there.\nOp's willingness to contribute ANYTHING toward his step- children is generous but not required.", "Stepparents are NOT obligated to ave for college,  even parents aren't obligated to do so.", ">  When you marry you agree to share certain things- like children.\n\nprenup is a thing.\n\nAlso, they still have THEIR dad. It's not like they get 4 parents all become fully responsible for their complete upbringing.", "Bullshit. I had a stepchild for 9 years.\n\nGot divorced. That severed my connection to the then young adult.\n\nThe stepchild (who I loved very much) had two parents already. I was a third, and an important person in her life for a time, but my ex remarried very quickly, and I was acquaintances at best with the other parent (my ex's ex).\n\nLife moved on, and I was no longer part of that family.\n\nStepchild and I stayed in loose touch through social media. But the connection was not what it was when I was married to their parent.\n\nTL/RD: NTA.", "It\u2019s all complicated. I can tell you from experience that I didn\u2019t feel like listening to a third adult trying to tell me what to do as a teen yet you live with them half of the time and your parent cares about them too.", "Yes, I agree with all of this, but the person you\u2019re responding to and criticizing is directly responding to a thread that claimed since her kids are only OPs stepkids, he shouldn\u2019t be doing anything for them. Should he be giving his bio kids inheritance to them? Absolutely not, but nobody in this thread suggested that, there was only pushback at the idea that he shouldn\u2019t be giving them anything of his own toward college because they \u201caren\u2019t his kids\u201d.", "Jesus fucking Christ. Maybe she is just hurt OP removed the chance for her to show she can be trusted?\n\nI'd never want my s.o's money but hiding it would emotionally hurt. Like maybe she was worried about providing for all 4 and angry she stressed for nothing. \n\n\nNo, straight to calling her a witch. Redditors are fucked in the head sometimes", "My parents paid for my school and I know they were not obligated and that was the biggest and most important gift I ever got. Really, they did not have to do that and did.", "Right. My boy from college is in this same boat. He\u2019d give up all the money to have his mom he lost at 9 back.\n\nThis new wife is sick in the head. Money really shows people\u2019s true colour.", "Yeah, good chance she's going to talk to his kids and ask them to voluntarily split the money with her kids. Probably behind his back.", "But why should he lie? Also, OP said his daughter told her step mum how much it was.", "That\u2019s exactly what the wife is after as if OP\u2019s late wife wanted greedy hands on the money\u2026 wait isn\u2019t that why her parents had control of the funds?", "> But what I find curious is OP married and agreed to pool money with his new wife for her daughter's education and that is awesome and a stand up step dad- for sure! But this new wife NEVER insisted on splitting this savings 4 ways to include OPs kids, why??\n\nOP says in the original post he told Nat that Sammy left their kids money for college so no need to worry about saving for them. Just didn't disclose the specific amount.", "Idk why these people can't read. It seemed pretty obvious you're just saying that, even though he doesn't have a legal obligation, he still sees them as his kids. For some reason, a lot of these replies seemed to interpret that as you saying he should give them all that money. Weird.", "People get caught up on legalities and forget that sometimes people just want to do good. Also the replies to this comment are *wild* yo", "May even corner the children to share with their step-siblings. Husband needs to speak to his kids and protect their interests.", "Legally she\u2019s not getting her hands on that money lawyer or not, unless they were to find a magical loophole. If it was an inheritance to the late wife (which is non splittable as it falls under separate property) and wasn\u2019t placed in a shared bank account between OP, and his late wife, then grandparents where given sole authority over the account, and OP released all control, there\u2019s no way that the current wife could get her hands on it. It would count as prior wealth/assets, which aren\u2019t even technically his. God I hope LW put that in her will, that it\u2019ll go strictly to the bio children just incase. \n\nThough, psychologically, that\u2019s another thing. Let\u2019s just hope OP taught his daughter, and son to not be pressured, or guilted, and to watch out for handouts under the guise of needing help (remember OP\u2019s shady family, which is what started this whole situation in the first place). OP would be smart not to tell those shady ones about his kid\u2019s funds for that very reason.", "Which is why the late wife was smart enough to put it in her parents name!", "Even in the case of financial catastrophe,  the money still would belong to the 2 kids, especially with their grandparents being in charge of the money.", "That\u2019s what\u2019s deep down my brain is telling me. Some shady sounding intentions. On the other hand keeping it a secret for even longer, and it slipping out, damn all hell would break loose as she would think he\u2019s prioritizing (justified since it\u2019s the kid\u2019s money)/favoring. That must be some serious cheddar in that account by now if it could afford a house, and the wife is sounding jealous too me.
