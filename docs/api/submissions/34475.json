So I stood my ground and said \"no, I'm green\". He then said he wasn't going to play and my response was just a simple \"okay.\" He then ran off to his room and cried. My step mother then scolded me and was like \"couldn't you just let him be green since he wanted it so bad?\" So am I the asshole or not?\n\nAnd I know that this probably sound ridiculous and like a \"kid problem\" but I always back down and let him have what he want since I know that it's usually not worth anything to fight him because our parents will take his side anyways.

Ideally you will get to a point where you maybe feel all that frustration on the inside but can keep calm in the moment and choose another colour.

But at the end of *this* lunch... the company card was awkwardly not forthcoming from this stingy director's wallet. Well, that's OK - submitting an expense reimbursement request is only a minor inconvenience.\r  \n\r  \nBut this director rejected the reimbursement! He tried to tell me it was ineligible as an \"optional social event\". Well, for whatever reason, that was my \"green piece\" moment. Rationally, I knew that $30 was absolutely trivial to risk alienating someone above me at work over. Being awful might be his prerogative, but dammit, I *draw the line* at taking lunch money out of my pocket! I was *getting* that damn $30 back, because that event was neither \"optional\" nor \"social\".\r  \n\r  \nSo I complained to HR... and long story short, HR forced him to approve it. :) So, yay, I got my way... ***but at what cost?*** Well, fortunately for me, a couple months later, he got fi... \\*cough cough\\* \"he retired\", so there were no lasting repercussions. Still, I can't recommend doing what I did.\r  \n\r  \nWe may all like to pretend we choose our battles based on cost/benefit... but often times, after a pattern of necessary retreat on more significant matters, the actual hill we end up feeling compelled to die on can be very small.", "With my kid, the non ASD one, I make it clear when I'm doing something that favors him over his brother because I know he gets the short end of the stick a lot.\n\nParenting is hard.\n\nParenting a kid with ASD is hard.

When one of my sisters picks up, I'll complain or go \"nooooo\" once, but if they really don't want to give it to me I just choose something else.

I believe parents don't realize how much they are damaging their children by favoring the other one. In the book, there are different family types, and how these parenting styles can affect the children and create emotional negligence.

Some adults will let whoever is kicking up the biggest fuss have their way to avoid conflict, especially when they don't think it's a big deal. They're doing him a disservice and being unfair to you. I've been trying to explain this to my parents for years, but they have it in their head that I'm just selfish and immature.

But the truth is that you both wanted green, and you're being told that your wants stop mattering the second they clash with his. That's unfair, don't let anyone tell you the contrary. The needs of others supercede our wants, but the wants of others cannot be forced against our own wants.\nYou need to sadly learn the lesson that there will always be people who will diminish you and your choices, and you will have to continue to plant your feet firmly.\nYour step-brother should learn that he doesn't get to impose his will and to deal with the frustration of not getting his way.\nI'm proud of you, kiddo.", "NTA - I\u2019m also going to say that even if he was always the green one, you shouldn\u2019t give in if you called it first.
