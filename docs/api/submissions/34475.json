So I stood my ground and said \"no, I'm green\". He then said he wasn't going to play and my response was just a simple \"okay.\" He then ran off to his room and cried. My step mother then scolded me and was like \"couldn't you just let him be green since he wanted it so bad?\" So am I the asshole or not?\n\nAnd I know that this probably sound ridiculous and like a \"kid problem\" but I always back down and let him have what he want since I know that it's usually not worth anything to fight him because our parents will take his side anyways.

Ideally you will get to a point where you maybe feel all that frustration on the inside but can keep calm in the moment and choose another colour.

But at the end of *this* lunch... the company card was awkwardly not forthcoming from this stingy director's wallet. Well, that's OK - submitting an expense reimbursement request is only a minor inconvenience.\r  \n\r  \nBut this director rejected the reimbursement! He tried to tell me it was ineligible as an \"optional social event\". Well, for whatever reason, that was my \"green piece\" moment. Rationally, I knew that $30 was absolutely trivial to risk alienating someone above me at work over. Being awful might be his prerogative, but dammit, I *draw the line* at taking lunch money out of my pocket! I was *getting* that damn $30 back, because that event was neither \"optional\" nor \"social\".\r  \n\r  \nSo I complained to HR... and long story short, HR forced him to approve it. :) So, yay, I got my way... ***but at what cost?*** Well, fortunately for me, a couple months later, he got fi... \\*cough cough\\* \"he retired\", so there were no lasting repercussions. Still, I can't recommend doing what I did.\r  \n\r  \nWe may all like to pretend we choose our battles based on cost/benefit... but often times, after a pattern of necessary retreat on more significant matters, the actual hill we end up feeling compelled to die on can be very small.", "With my kid, the non ASD one, I make it clear when I'm doing something that favors him over his brother because I know he gets the short end of the stick a lot.\n\nParenting is hard.\n\nParenting a kid with ASD is hard.  They are soooo rigid.\n\nDo your best.  I know how frustrating it is.", "my guy, not everyone on the spectrum is as \"rigid\" as you say. you don't speak for us. it's the parent's fault this kid can't cope with being told \"no\".", "Not a problem. I wish I had someone to tell me these things when I was your age. I had kind of a sense of it but couldn't explain and then just told myself I was being unreasonable, the way they did. Didn't start really putting 2 and 2 together until I was much older and still haven't really gotten the back bone but I'm working on it. Just hang in there and trust yourself. You got this!", "Yep, I always choose red when I play the board game \"sorry\". When one of my sisters picks up, I'll complain or go \"nooooo\" once, but if they really don't want to give it to me I just choose something else. It's not that big of a deal, it's annoying for sure and I'm gonna think about it the whole game AND mix up my pieces for their's because I'm used to being red, but I'm not gonna throw a fit about it or demand it.", "Also autistic. Learning how to deal with disappointments like this is crucial in being able to handle bigger issues later on.", "Thank you! I really appreciate your words of encouragement. I just sometimes hope my parents would sometimes do something in my favor instead of my step brother.\n\nBut once again, I really appreciate your kind words and your response! I will keep it in mind for upcoming events similar to this one.", "who downvotes this?", "I am on spectrum too, and I am only speaking to picking battles.\n\nA I wrong that symbolic fights with autistic people aren't useful?\n\nDid you also notice I didn't call anyone an asshole?\n\nIt's nobody's fault.\n\nThis is just about effective communication including an ASD person of unknown constraints and those dynamics.", "Thank you and same goes for you! Keep on fighting and I promise that you will grow that back bone if you just believe in yourself. Don't forget, the Warriors of Reddit are always with you.", "we wouldn't play games together nicely. I always choose red as well although if i really had to chose something else i would take blue. If my parents didn't set boundaries when someone disagreed i would be a really spoiled brat. Like i am stubborn and annoying sure but i know when to give up, some of the time"]}
