You can\u2019t be an actual godparent in the Catholic Church if you\u2019re not at minimum baptized, but I believe you have to be confirmed as well. When my kids were baptized, the priest required a reference from my children\u2019s godparents\u2019 priests to verify they were practicing as well. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s standard or if he was just strict.", "NTA any real Catholic knows godparents need to be Catholic, she never should have asked you in the first place.

Your best friend doesn't have the right to force you to be baptized.\n\nI will note though that for Catholics, godparents must be baptized Catholic and have undergone the Sacrament of Confirmation. This is because they are expected to help raise the child with Catholic values in accordance with the Religious views of the parents.\n\nThat said, where I'm from, Churches aren't really strict with who gets to be godparents, in that, no one submits their certificates of Confirmation/Baptism as proof that they are, in fact, Catholic. I'm not sure how it is where you're from though.", "NTA. Your friend is probably frustrated that she didn't think it through before asking you and other friend to be godparents given her Catholic faith. Her expectations are unrealistic.\n\nIn Catholic Church, godparents do need to be baptized as Catholic, and also need to be a confirmed Catholic and received communion. Not a quick process -- involves some preparation classes and meetings that usually takes at least 10 months to a year.\n\nMaybe you and your other could have some other role apart from the baby's actual baptism, like guideparent or something.\n\n(It is possible for a non-Catholic Christian to be a Christian witness at a baptism as long as there is one other Godparent who is Catholic, but that wouldn't help here.)", "NTA\n\nYou can't be godparents if you aren't baptized. The Catholic church doesn't allow it. It's not that she's unfairly taking the title away, it's just not possible without baptism. \n\nThe fact that she asked you knowing you needed to be baptized is pretty AHish. Should never try to convert people, especially when their beliefs are well known by the one making the request. \n\nAsk about being witnesses instead. That's a way you can still be included in the baptism if you want to be.", "NTA.  That is so inappropriate of her to ask you to make a covenant in order to be a godparent, with no question of your own faith or lack thereof.", "NTA.

The god parents chosen are supposed to be of the same religion because they are accepting responsibility for the child\u2019s spiritual education.  It was completely unfair of your friend to ask for two non Catholics to take this role.  And you would not just need to be baptized, you would need to be educated in the catholic faith to be a good spiritual guide to the child.\n\nGodparents is the religious aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing.  This is wholly and completely separate from who would be legally responsible for the child if the parents were no longer in the picture.\n\nYour friend is out of line to ask you this as neither of you are of the same faith as your friend and would not be able to act as the spiritual guide for the child in the catholic faith.  Your friend would need to ask two Catholics to do this.\n\nIn the Protestant faiths, the rules are a bit looser.  In the catholic faith the rules are rigid and has specific guidelines and duties.", "Initiation into the Church is not that easy for adults.  You have to go through classes and are officially initiated the Saturday before Easter.\n\nNo legitimate church would baptized adults on the fly.

God parents have to be baptized Catholic (or if it's a couple at least one of them has to be I think) so it's not really *her* rule, it's the church's.

She must not have been thinking.", "It might surprise you but the original intention of a godparent was someone tasked with the spiritual mentorship for a child, thus the name.\n\nI don't think, until further notice, your friend is in the wrong any more than you are.

I was initially going to say NAH because she asked, and you and your friend said no.  However, asking someone to change their/adopt a religion in not a reasonable request. If you and your other friends are \"besties\" with her, she should have known that neither of you would be willing to do this, in which case it should have been, \"just so you know, I would love for you two to be the godparents to my child, but that would require you to be baptized\".

So then it comes time to pick godparents, and he picks his bestie as godfather, except he\u2019s not Catholic either. So I got a Sponsor. Works just like a godfather - I got checks in the mail on birthday and holiday and graduation - none of the baptism. \n\nAnd also for what it\u2019s worth, my friend tried to force me to lie about being confirmed in the Church so I could be one of 4 godmothers. I refused, but she handed me the baby at the service and dared me to refuse in public.

If that's the case, then it's not her decision, and I would only blame her for being a bit cuckoo about her expectations. However if Catholicism doesn't require baptism prior to godparenthood, then I guess it's her choice to uninvite you, but yeesh.  Not classy!", "NAH.

Maybe if you don\u2019t check you just assume but it\u2019s a crazy thing for this person to ask.", "NTA", "You are NTA.  She is definitely a judgemental asshole however.  Let her find other godparents.", "NTA.", "My understanding is a godparent needs to be baptized into the church the child is psrt of..that it is a position of religious significance....not jyst a spevial aunt or something. ..in that case it seems reasonable if the church wont allow it....its a religius ceremony.\n\nIts not discriminitory to have restrictions on non citizens from holding public positions, citizenship is simply a prerequisite, how is this different.", "Yep. NTA", "Since the father of said fetus is referred to as baby daddy and not husband, it looks like Friend feels she can bypass those things that are inconvenient to her wants(such as no premarital sex)", "It does make the friend an AH, because she can't have been UNAWARE that these two friends are not Catholic.  \nAnd when she asked them to be Godparents, she did not at the time say, \"I want you to be my baby's Godparent, but you'll have to be baptized as a Catholic first.  \nOP=NTA", "Honestly I don't think she's pushing her religion on them. I think her \"offense\" is actually just irritation at the situation. She wanted these women to be the godmother's and that could happen if they were baptized. (And honestly, \"no, sorry I'm not mad at you I'm just frustrated with the situation,\" isn't an uncommon sentiment, you know?)\n\n>Neither me nor my friend are allowed to be godmothers anymore, accordingly.\n\nThis isn't OP'a friend's rule. This is a Catholic church rule. \n\nI'd bet that if OP talked to her friend she'd find the friend is just frustrated at the circumstances. \n\nAnd honestly, if the friend is actually mad at OP? Then maybe OP would have a clearer idea if they should even remain friends.", "You need to learn what \"legally binding\" and \"severity\"  means.", "Idk, it\u2019s weird to me that someone would be offended that someone else isn\u2019t baptized. If someone is that uptight, they need to rethink religion and realize not everyone shares the same views as them lol", "NTA - I am the godmother to my niece.   \nShe was christened Catholic in a Catholic Church.   \nI am not baptised it wasn\u2019t a problem.    \nAs long as I spoke to the priest beforehand and promised to bring her up in her parents religion.   \nThey didn\u2019t need anything else.", "It's an odd one isn't it? To marry my wife in a catholic church, her sect of christianity, we both had to attend a course and I had to prove my baptismal history. Most priests I have spoken with have supported our multi-faith culture but I assume background is important for god parents status because in event of God parents taking over the spiritual growth of a child it should be in the same church, apparently.\n\nThis is a weird one and you're NTA and honestly, your friend should never have asked the two of you if she understood you at all.", "NTA, from an atheist whose kids' godparent is a pagan.", "If it is a Catholic Baptism, I think it is more than just being baptized.  You will probably have a few weeks of instruction on becoming a Catholic.  They won't baptize you just so you can be godparents. She needs to select people who are already active Catholics.", "NTA First thing it sounds like she isn\u2019t a practicing Catholic. Otherwise she would know that in order to be a godparent you must have received your sacraments and you must provide the proof. In other words you must present your certificates for baptism,first reconciliation/first communion, confirmation and if married you may have to provide you were married within the church. I am sorry that she was so disrespectful of your feelings.", "NTA but also as a catholic you technically only need 1 godparent to also be catholic so she could find a currently catholic person+ one of you to be godparents.\n\nMy husband is also atheist but prior to getting married our deal was any children we had would be baptized as it is important to me. Church did not care that he was atheist, only that I was catholic and had at least 1 catholic godparent.", "NTA\n\nThis is too much to blame on pregnancy hormones", "I don't understand why you think you are an asshole here. Freedom of religion is a thing.", "NTA. That\u2019s not hormones, that\u2019s just general entitlement and being an AH.", "NTA I\u2019m pagan and in your shoes, I would decline to be a godparent.", "I disagree with the N A H votes.  If she wants you both to be godparents and she feels that strongly about it, the expectation is that you\u2019ll continue the religion for her.  You could argue that for yourself (not your Sikh friend) that it doesn\u2019t hurt to get baptised since you don\u2019t believe in it, but it won\u2019t stop there.  NTA.", "ESH - She asked you to be godparents. In the catholic way being a godparent is a serious thing with rules, one if them being you have to be catholic.\n\nShe should have told you, that she meant real, catholic godparents, and you should have asked, what being godparents would be like. You should read a contract, before signing it.", "NTA she asked, you declined. You are not the AH at all and neither is your other friend. Your pregnant bestir on the other hand is a raging AH. She should have accept that you guys didn't want to get baptised. Forcing her beliefs and trying to get you baptised is not okay. \nShe can just pick other people who are baptised to be God parents.\nThis is definately not pregnancy hormones.", "Your friend has no right to compel you to do this, you should tell her you have considered it and you\u2019re going to be baptised into the Church of England (Protestant)Scientology/Satan or become a Sikh. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re an Atheist why are you even remotely considering becoming the child\u2019s godmother?  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f It\u2019s not just a fluffy bunny/bragging rights position, it literally means taking responsibility for the child\u2019s religious upbringing.\n\nIf you want to salvage this friendship, you should both politely decline otherwise ESH\n\nEDIT Changed my mind from YWBTA to ESH", "you're NTA but your friend is huge ah she's literally converting people out there.", "Baby daddy? Are they married? The way you post it makes me think not. And I find it very ironic that a woman who is so staunchly Catholic and having a child out of wedlock,  is so worried about following the rules of you being baptized to be a God parent. Just thinking out loud. NTA", "NTA. This is incredibly unfair and one of the reasons I left the church was that we were told to convert people. And it's not necessary. In Catholicism only one godparent is required to be Catholic. They are the one officially entered into records as the godparent.", "Wouldn't one only ask very close and good friends as godmothers? \n\n*How* did she *not* know? \n\nNTA\n\nSeems she's trying to use the godmother gig to force her religion onto you", "NTA obviously, but it might have something to do with her wanting her own child to be baptised. I got baptised age 13, but for babies it's commen that their godparents are named in the church ceremony and that obviously can only happen if the godparents are actually members of the church. I was baptised with 3 other 13/14 year olds and one had no godparent, one had two and I had one because most members of my family weren't official members in the church. It had nothing to do with friendship and everything to do with the official ceremony. Of course it might be different where you are from but for me that would be a logical reason why she might have asked you, doesn't mean she was in the right though", "Cringe", "My friend asked me to be a godparent. Turned out they wanted me to be baptised at the same time as the baby. I politely declined and no offence was taken. i didnt want to be baptised into their religion for a symbolic role. No offence was taken, I'm still in their lives 14 years later. NTA", "Unless the rules have changed, the Catholic Church requires only one godparent be Catholic.  My cousin\u2019s dad is Lutheran and his uncle was allowed to be godfather as long as the godmother was Catholic.", "There were strict guidelines of who could be godparents when I baptized my kids in the Roman Catholic church. They wouldn't have let me pick two Godmothers. I had to pick at least one Godparent and if I had two, then they needed to be different genders.", "Was baptized Catholic, but not raised that way. (It was only really only for my great-grandmother.)\n\nBoth of my godparents were baptized as children, but neither are practicing Catholic. My godmother went protestant as an adult, and my godfather was thrown out of the Catholic church for being gay. Neither were told they couldn't be my godparents.", "~~It doesn't say BFF got mad or offended. She would be TA if she did, considering getting baptized Catholic isn't a small ask.~~ But he fact is, OP and the Sikh friend are unable to meet the requirements to be godparents in Catholicism, so others must be invited to the role. That's not a punishment; it's just the rules. ~~N A H~~\n\nETA: CyclonicHavoc is right; I did miss it. NTA", "Was she aware that the couldn\u2019t be named godmothers if they weren\u2019t catholic before she asked them? It\u2019s possible she found out later that it would be an issue.", "just saying... \n\nthe Catholic Church just requires one of the godparents to be Catholic. so if the Preggo Bestie gets at least one more person (who is Catholic - like an aunt or something) then the besties can still be godmothers", "The post literally says, \u201cShe has acted offended by the fact that neither of us are baptised\u201d.\n\nI think you must have missed this?", "Oh, I was just thinking that maybe OP interpreted the friend's frustration with the situation as irritation/offense at OP. \n\nBut it sounds like OP's friend was frustrated, but instead of checking in with the friend OP just assumed the frustration was aimed at OP, without any real comments to back it up.\n\nSo basically, in true AITA fashion there is a lack of communication. OP is assuming her friend is mad about the baptism when she could just be frustrated with all the requirements/hoops/etc... And if OP would just ask, \"hey, are you mad at me about this?\" Then OP would either learn that her friend was never angry with OP, or that OP might not want to be friends with someone who gets angry that someone won't convert. \n\nEither way that's valuable Information, no?", "I totally understand. Honestly, it\u2019s open to interpretation because we can only go by what the OP gives us, so you could be right too. \n\nI wish people would include more detail instead of being vague about stuff lol", "For real. Give me specifics!! \ud83e\udd23", "Lmao ikr \ud83d\ude06"]}
