She could have informed you she preferred her child to be raised this way - which in hindsight may suck to hear if you wanted to be involved in the child\u2019s life in this way\u2026.  but it\u2019s better than asking you to compromise beliefs.\n\nI almost want to say NAH but being offended to someone\u2019s religion isn\u2019t very catholic of her or is it..

You can\u2019t be an actual godparent in the Catholic Church if you\u2019re not at minimum baptized, but I believe you have to be confirmed as well. When my kids were baptized, the priest required a reference from my children\u2019s godparents\u2019 priests to verify they were practicing as well. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s standard or if he was just strict.", "NTA any real Catholic knows godparents need to be Catholic, she never should have asked you in the first place.

Your best friend doesn't have the right to force you to be baptized.\n\nI will note though that for Catholics, godparents must be baptized Catholic and have undergone the Sacrament of Confirmation. This is because they are expected to help raise the child with Catholic values in accordance with the Religious views of the parents.\n\nThat said, where I'm from, Churches aren't really strict with who gets to be godparents, in that, no one submits their certificates of Confirmation/Baptism as proof that they are, in fact, Catholic. I'm not sure how it is where you're from though.", "NTA. Your friend is probably frustrated that she didn't think it through before asking you and other friend to be godparents given her Catholic faith. Her expectations are unrealistic.\n\nIn Catholic Church, godparents do need to be baptized as Catholic, and also need to be a confirmed Catholic and received communion. Not a quick process -- involves some preparation classes and meetings that usually takes at least 10 months to a year.\n\nMaybe you and your other could have some other role apart from the baby's actual baptism, like guideparent or something.\n\n(It is possible for a non-Catholic Christian to be a Christian witness at a baptism as long as there is one other Godparent who is Catholic, but that wouldn't help here.)", "NTA\n\nYou can't be godparents if you aren't baptized. The Catholic church doesn't allow it. It's not that she's unfairly taking the title away, it's just not possible without baptism. \n\nThe fact that she asked you knowing you needed to be baptized is pretty AHish. Should never try to convert people, especially when their beliefs are well known by the one making the request. \n\nAsk about being witnesses instead. That's a way you can still be included in the baptism if you want to be.", "NTA.  That is so inappropriate of her to ask you to make a covenant in order to be a godparent, with no question of your own faith or lack thereof.", "NTA. She cannot expect people to become Catholic just because she wants them to be to be godparents. My father was agnostic and not baptized but was able to be a godparent. Only one needed to be at the time my cousins were born. Not sure if that has changed.", "NTA. Fundamentally I don't think adults should get baptized unless they are committing to Christianity. It's not something someone do to check a box.\n\nYour friend is asking you to basically do that - get baptized for the sake of being baptized but it's not like it changes who you are or your values.

The god parents chosen are supposed to be of the same religion because they are accepting responsibility for the child\u2019s spiritual education.  It was completely unfair of your friend to ask for two non Catholics to take this role.  And you would not just need to be baptized, you would need to be educated in the catholic faith to be a good spiritual guide to the child.\n\nGodparents is the religious aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing.  This is wholly and completely separate from who would be legally responsible for the child if the parents were no longer in the picture.\n\nYour friend is out of line to ask you this as neither of you are of the same faith as your friend and would not be able to act as the spiritual guide for the child in the catholic faith.  Your friend would need to ask two Catholics to do this.\n\nIn the Protestant faiths, the rules are a bit looser.  In the catholic faith the rules are rigid and has specific guidelines and duties.", "Initiation into the Church is not that easy for adults.  You have to go through classes and are officially initiated the Saturday before Easter.\n\nNo legitimate church would baptized adults on the fly.

You and your friend are free to decline but if your friend is a committed Catholic then she has to abide by the church\u2019s rules for who can be a godparent.  The requirement that godparents been people of that faith aren\u2019t set by your friend.  She asked, you said no.", "NTA Catholicism is fucking wild. God parents have to be baptized Catholic (or if it's a couple at least one of them has to be I think) so it's not really *her* rule, it's the church's.

She must not have been thinking.", "It might surprise you but the original intention of a godparent was someone tasked with the spiritual mentorship for a child, thus the name.\n\nI don't think, until further notice, your friend is in the wrong any more than you are.

Ages ridiculous for asking anyone who isn't Catholic to be the baby's godparents.\n\nThe whole role of a godparent is to encourage the child into catholicism, especially if the parents are incapacitated or deceased.", "NTA - your friend has no right to ask you or your Sikh friend to change religion. \n\nHowever if she wants her child raised in her faith (should she pass away when the child is a minor) then it would probably be better to choose someone who already believes in the same religion.", "NTA", "NTA.  I was initially going to say NAH because she asked, and you and your friend said no.  However, asking someone to change their/adopt a religion in not a reasonable request. If you and your other friends are \"besties\" with her, she should have known that neither of you would be willing to do this, in which case it should have been, \"just so you know, I would love for you two to be the godparents to my child, but that would require you to be baptized\".

So then it comes time to pick godparents, and he picks his bestie as godfather, except he\u2019s not Catholic either. So I got a Sponsor. Works just like a godfather - I got checks in the mail on birthday and holiday and graduation - none of the baptism. \n\nAnd also for what it\u2019s worth, my friend tried to force me to lie about being confirmed in the Church so I could be one of 4 godmothers. I refused, but she handed me the baby at the service and dared me to refuse in public.

If that's the case, then it's not her decision, and I would only blame her for being a bit cuckoo about her expectations. However if Catholicism doesn't require baptism prior to godparenthood, then I guess it's her choice to uninvite you, but yeesh.  Not classy!", "NAH.

There may be one male or one female sponsor but if there are two they should not be of the same gender. \n\nAccording to the Church, the role of a godparent is to: \u201cset an example, help teach their child about the Catholic faith, have a lifelong relationship of prayer, faith sharing, and love. \n\nI\u2019d gently ask her to review the requirements for godparents with her parish. Frequently, they request that the official godparent participate in baptism preparation classes. I was the official godparent for my niece.

You just can\u2019t be a \u201cgodmother\u201d at the baptism / in the church\u2019s eyes. One of the reasons for a godmother in the church is to be a spiritual guidance to the child. You aren\u2019t capable or willing to do that, so I think this whole thing is silly. You can be auntie and they can choose someone who actually believes in their religion to take on the official godparent role", "NTA, but the whole point in a godparent is to raise them in the parents faith if something happened to them.

At least in the US one god parent has to be a full practicing Catholic, which means not just baptism, but also communion and confirmation.

If you\u2019re not a believer, it doesn\u2019t make a bunch of sense to stand in front of the church and promise to help raise the baby in the Catholic faith.

It's renouncing Satan and promising to raise child in faith. Of course they have to be Catholic.

And it has nothing to do with the rules themselves, but what baptism represents. Even if it was possible to find a loophole, she should seek person who's going to be a religious companion during the raising of her child. And with who'd she'd be comfortable leaving her child's with if something happens to them. \n\nIt seems stupid, but wouldn't Muslim parents prefer have their children raised by someone who will protect their children's religious identity?

Going to church and sending in donations makes you a practicing catholic.
