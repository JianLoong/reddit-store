Mal's wife passed away four years ago from an asthma attack. Two years after she passed Mal started dating again. Casually at first, but several months ago he met a woman he wants a more serious relationship with. He told his kids about her and after a few weeks of them knowing he sat them down and asked them to be honest about their feelings on him finding someone, and dating. His older two told him they were sad he wanted to be with someone else, and that they wished he was more like grandma (mine and my brother's grandma to be specific) and was happy with the idea of their mom being his one and only like grandma felt grandpa was her one and only. They did say they would be happy for him. But that was how they felt. The youngest said they felt weird about someone maybe marrying him because they didn't want anyone taking their mom's position in the family.\n\nMy brother was a lot of different things after that talk. Agitated, frustrated and even angry. He was talking to me about it and I could see how he was responding. I suggested that he should think of it as positive that the kids want to support and be happy for him even with their feelings and that he should be proud they could speak openly to him, because many kids might have lied because they didn't feel safe to be open.\n\nThis did not help. After a couple of more weeks he was still in that same state. I suggested he speak to a therapist and he snapped at me, told me he didn't need a therapist because he knew how he was feeling. I didn't argue with him.  Then after a few hours he called and said therapy wasn't needed and he was fine.\n\nThe next day he came to my house and asked me why I was so unbothered by it all. I asked him what he meant and he told me he would have expected me to say the kids need to see things from his perspective. I told him I could see both their points. That he was entitled and deserved to find happiness and love if he wanted that. That they had known grandma their whole lives and have heard how much she loved grandpa and never wanted another man after him, even after 50 years of him being gone, and it didn't shock me that they would want him to feel the same about their mom, because they loved both of them just as much as each other and in their ideal world nobody else could compare for him, just like it's probably that way for them with her. He became so angry and told me I shouldn't want to deny him happiness in his life. I told him to stop and consider that if he was reacting that negatively to what I was saying, how had he reacted to his kids, because all the things I said about the kids feeling comfortable being honest with him would go out the window if he expressed all that anger at them for being honest, when *he* *asked* for their honest feelings.

Maybe I should have offered more understanding to him instead of what I did. I feel like saying what I did, and telling him the kids might change toward him, was wrong, because I don't actually know if he has shown the kids how he feels. He has shown me, an adult.

I said similar things to my dad when he wanted to marry my bonus mom because (at the time) I had dreamed of him and my mom getting back together.

Everything you said sounds honest and true to me.\n\nPlus I wouldn\u2019t want to make it any worse but I think the kids are at delicate ages.\nHe has his whole life to have romantic partners but not that many years till his kids are adults.\nI expect dad is also partially hoping for someone to help w the kids, but they all should be in at least family therapy so they can work this out. \nI am a big advocate for therapy, and he obviously could benefit from it, but I\u2019ve also got to commend him for raising kids who feel like they can be honest.\nAlthough he had an inappropriate reaction. People often get angriest when they know they are in the wrong.\nWhich is why he needs therapy so he can work through that stuff before he tries to grow his family.", "NTA - rake over what he's saying - he's repeatedly twisting your words and the words of the kids. \n\nFor example, youre saying that *showing his kids his level of anger* will alienate them and punish them for their honesty, but he's hearing 'I'm not allowed to angry?'\n\nThe kids saying 'we won't stop you, we want you to be happy, but we will feel sad about the situation', and he's hearing 'I'm not *allowed* to be happy???' \n\nHe's in King Baby mode - the moving on romantically isn't the issue - no one isn't supportive of it. The issue is he wants it to be easy, frictionless, and uncomplicated, he wants to play fully supported, happy families. He wants what's best for HIM to be best for EVERYONE. \n\nREally, he's learning that he *can* do what he wants, but it will be complicated. I mean, the poor guy is a widower - I sympathise with him. But this is childish emotional reasoning.", "NTA. He asked a question and got honest answers. If that bothers him so much it makes him angry, then he has issues he should definitely go to therapy for.\n\nNow he thinks *you're* the angry person? That's baffling.", "Definitely NTA. You really shouldn't ask children questions you aren't prepared to hear their answers to. My dad asked my brother (5) and I (6) whether we were happy he and my stepmom were getting married a couple weeks before their wedding. She was degrading, a perfectionist, and she made our lives incredibly tense... Normally we wouldn't have the courage to speak negatively, but he specifically asked, so surely he wanted our true opinions, right? And maybe this was a chance to curb the misery that had entered our lives. So we said no and started to say why. He became enraged, said \"Well it's happening!!\", and stomped out of the room.\n\nThat is a core memory for me, and I've often thought about it since I've had my own child.", "NTA. I don't think he's hearing what you're all actually saying, though. He's hearing that his kids/you don't want him to date. Not sure how he's going to hear it without therapy or someone he listens to talking to him.", "NTA. He didn't want honesty when he asked his children. He wanted them to validate his feelings. Their response was incredibly mature, and he should be proud to have children like that. Instead, he got upset because they weren't jumping up and down to meet their \"new mom.\"\n\nHe expected you to agree with him and say his kids were wrong. However, when you pointed out to him that you can see both sides of this, he took this as a betrayal.\n\nHonestly, you suggested therapy for him and I have to agree. It's a shame his children are more mature about this than he is.", "His first mistake was asking his kids how they would feel when it's obvious how they would feel no kid is like \"yeah get someone new and forget mum\" that's just not a thing. \n\nHe should do what makes him happy the end. What grandma decided to do has nothing to do with him so I'm not sure why you keep referencing as if it matters. If grandma decided to be lonely her whole life that her problem and isn't a compelling argument", "NTA and he definitely needs therapy or family counseling. He wants to hear what he wants to hear. Its unreasonable for him to never find love again or be expected to pine for his dead wife for 50 years, but the kids are also young, they probably do not understand the struggles of single parenthood and missing a life partner, they just miss their mom.  14 is not 18 or 20, that is still very young. He cannot expect them to have adult understanding in this situation. \n\nHis responses seem like a mix of selfishness, in not wanting to hear the truth, and possibly guilt over wanting to do the opposite of their wishes. Its the price you pay when you become a parent, their needs>yours. Idk how else you get that point through to him. I'm sure he can get the kids to come around to his side, but its going to take professional help.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not wrong for your brother to want to move on, but he shouldn\u2019t be getting angry that his own children might not yet be over the death of their mother.

I understand you love your brother, but what is his cognitive capacity? I ask because he doesn't seem to be able to understand nuance or empathy.

If he has processed it, the question is relevant. \n\nThe way both you and his children have expressed things is entirely respectful and healthy, but he seems to latch onto niche aspects of what is said, contort it, and make it fit a sense of outrage he is determined to feel.

Especially when the kids talked about hoping he would be more like our grandma. Maybe part of him wishes he could be like her for them. Or maybe he feels guilty for letting them hear her talk about grandpa over the years and how she found her happiness in other ways so she could be with him again.

Which is also why you should never have expectations when talking to someone about their feelings.", "I don't see a problem with it because this was never about making it their decision. It was about getting an idea of where they were at, but he went in with preconceived ideas of that and was not able to handle the truth. He is already dating and is already with someone he wants to get serious with. I don't see him walking away from the relationship and I don't think he should. His goal was to figure out how best to introduce the kids to her.

If you didn\u2019t tell your brother, would anyone else? \n\nMy two cents:\n\nI was 14 when my own mother passed on. She was sick a while and my siblings were 10, 2 and 1.\n\nMy dad dated here and there but we never met any of his dates. My siblings were happy not to know, I was curious.\n\nWhen his current fianc\u00e9e came into our lives a few years ago, my siblings were 6-15 ish. The eldest acted out emotionally. The youngest two played up for attention.\n\nMy dad had many conversations with us all about how HE felt and how WE felt. What we ALL wanted.\n\nHe told us he was lonely and missed our mum but that he wanted to live for many many years more and would like company into his old age. Someone to enjoy his life with. My parents were 40 when my mum passed. He had HALF his entire life left to live.\n\nIt took us a while but we all grew into a new normal. Kids from both sides get along fine now with no arguing. Everyone is content.\n\nWe all miss our mum. His fianc\u00e9e will never be our mum. But she\u2019s the woman my dad is now sharing his life with. He loves her and wants to be with her. She\u2019s kind and she\u2019s funny and she tells our dad off when he\u2019s out of order! I\u2019m glad we all get along.\n\nDo we want someone to replace our mum? No. Do we wish my dad would love my mum til he died? Who said he doesn\u2019t? \n\nEnd of the day, my dad loves my mum still. He visits her on her birthday and on Mother\u2019s Day and on her death day. We go sometimes at Easter or Valentine\u2019s Day but it\u2019s not all encompassing. I\u2019m glad my dad has moved on. I miss my mum something terribly. But I also love my dads fianc\u00e9e. She never took on a parenting role or moved into our home. But she helps me when I ask and she talks to me when I need.\n\nMy dad went to hospital recently and we were all scared he wasn\u2019t going to make it. She was the only one at his bedside 24/7 when his own family were busy having a pissing contest. His mum tried to stop his own kids coming to see him and his fianc\u00e9e - the woman we didn\u2019t want to replace mum - SHE is the only one who stuck up for us and made my Nan step down. We may never have got to see him for the last time had things gone sour if she never stepped in.\n\nThe one who was most upset about the fianc\u00e9e was my brother, who is now 14. He was an angry child and was often physically violent and verbally abusive. He hated all of us. He was my mum\u2019s baby boy as she only had girls before and after him. He missed her terribly despite being so young and he acted out horribly. He\u2019s more understood now and he\u2019s been more understanding. He doesn\u2019t cosy up to the fianc\u00e9e or seek her out but he respects her. He respects that my dad loves her. \n\nSometimes our feelings are big and that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s my experience. It sounds to me like your brother needn\u2019t worry. His children sound far more accepting than we were as children.\n\nTell him to explain his feelings calmly and then spend a day with just him and the kids doing something their mum would do, maybe visiting her too at some point.

There has to be something more about this that makes him angry, & you'd be most likely right that it stems off from the grief that he seemed to not fully process up until this point. He could be clamming up & depending on this one woman to save himself from his own grief & fully expecting for his kids to also be on board. He may equate this new relationship as a stepping stone to moving forward from his late wife, or something new to forget about his grief entirely. \n\nOverall, it seems that the kids & the brother are at an impasse due to different interpretations. Good on the kids for being honest & good on the dad for creating that open & honest environment to do so in the first place.

Yes, he should seek therapy along with his children how to move forward and retain open and good relationships with each other.  But, no one should compare your brother to your grandmother.  Just because one chose to remain alone does not mean everyone should do the same.  The children are young and do not understand completely what that means.  Right now, of course, they want to remember  the family unit.  But one day, the children will grow up and have family\u2019s of their own and will move out of the home from dad. What about dad then?

Neither kids nor OP actually suggested he's not allowed to date yet this is what he projects onto them, when they didn't give him 100% enthusiastic blessing he was looking for.

Some want to go clubbing, some want to travel, some wish they could take a certain time-intensive promotion, and on and on. The kids come first. \n\nHe feels guilty because he knows he's putting his wants over his kids' needs and wants. Even if we make the question \"Do you like her?\" Wat if they said \"no\"?  I'm guessing in your scenario, he would still go forward with the relationship, regardless. \n\nWhich means he (and you, it seems) don't put any weight on the kids' side of the argument. They will always lose. You have to listen *and* take into consideration. \n\nThere are a lot of times people have to choose between a serious, in-the-moment relationship and other priorities. Some caregivers choose not to have relationships, some because of their profession, because they have pets, etc. \n\nIt seems he could continue to see this person quietly for a while and allow his kids more time to get used to her, process their feelings, etc. Unless the lady is pressuring him (which isn't a good sign), he probably just needs to slow down."]}
