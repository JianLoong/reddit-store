{"id": 11928, "submission_id": "11nir6f", "title": "AITA for telling my brother if he's reacting negatively to what I say he should look at how he reacted to what his children told him?", "selftext": "My brother Mal has three kids ages 14, 12 and 10. Mal's wife passed away four years ago from an asthma attack. Two years after she passed Mal started dating again. Casually at first, but several months ago he met a woman he wants a more serious relationship with. He told his kids about her and after a few weeks of them knowing he sat them down and asked them to be honest about their feelings on him finding someone, and dating. His older two told him they were sad he wanted to be with someone else, and that they wished he was more like grandma (mine and my brother's grandma to be specific) and was happy with the idea of their mom being his one and only like grandma felt grandpa was her one and only. They did say they would be happy for him. But that was how they felt. The youngest said they felt weird about someone maybe marrying him because they didn't want anyone taking their mom's position in the family.\n\nMy brother was a lot of different things after that talk. Agitated, frustrated and even angry. He was talking to me about it and I could see how he was responding. I suggested that he should think of it as positive that the kids want to support and be happy for him even with their feelings and that he should be proud they could speak openly to him, because many kids might have lied because they didn't feel safe to be open.\n\nThis did not help. After a couple of more weeks he was still in that same state. I suggested he speak to a therapist and he snapped at me, told me he didn't need a therapist because he knew how he was feeling. I didn't argue with him.  Then after a few hours he called and said therapy wasn't needed and he was fine.\n\nThe next day he came to my house and asked me why I was so unbothered by it all. I asked him what he meant and he told me he would have expected me to say the kids need to see things from his perspective. I told him I could see both their points. That he was entitled and deserved to find happiness and love if he wanted that. That they had known grandma their whole lives and have heard how much she loved grandpa and never wanted another man after him, even after 50 years of him being gone, and it didn't shock me that they would want him to feel the same about their mom, because they loved both of them just as much as each other and in their ideal world nobody else could compare for him, just like it's probably that way for them with her. He became so angry and told me I shouldn't want to deny him happiness in his life. I told him to stop and consider that if he was reacting that negatively to what I was saying, how had he reacted to his kids, because all the things I said about the kids feeling comfortable being honest with him would go out the window if he expressed all that anger at them for being honest, when *he* *asked* for their honest feelings. He told me he couldn't believe I was saying he had no right to be angry and stormed off.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678434966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nir6f/aita_for_telling_my_brother_if_hes_reacting/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is, I have always know my brother as a good dad, a man who puts his kids first and I can understand his maybe disappointment or sadness that the kids feel as they do. Maybe I should have offered more understanding to him instead of what I did. I feel like saying what I did, and telling him the kids might change toward him, was wrong, because I don't actually know if he has shown the kids how he feels. He has shown me, an adult. But I am not the kids. And I might be an asshole for suggesting he would do that.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I said similar things to my dad when he wanted to marry my bonus mom because (at the time) I had dreamed of him and my mom getting back together. My dad took that in stride and helped me ease into a life with her with the knowledge that I was uneasy but hopeful for his happiness and I\u2019m very thankful for it now.", "Nta. Everything you said sounds honest and true to me.\n\nPlus I wouldn\u2019t want to make it any worse but I think the kids are at delicate ages.\nHe has his whole life to have romantic partners but not that many years till his kids are adults.\nI expect dad is also partially hoping for someone to help w the kids, but they all should be in at least family therapy so they can work this out. \nI am a big advocate for therapy, and he obviously could benefit from it, but I\u2019ve also got to commend him for raising kids who feel like they can be honest.\nAlthough he had an inappropriate reaction. People often get angriest when they know they are in the wrong.\nWhich is why he needs therapy so he can work through that stuff before he tries to grow his family.", "NTA - rake over what he's saying - he's repeatedly twisting your words and the words of the kids. \n\nFor example, youre saying that *showing his kids his level of anger* will alienate them and punish them for their honesty, but he's hearing 'I'm not allowed to angry?'\n\nThe kids saying 'we won't stop you, we want you to be happy, but we will feel sad about the situation', and he's hearing 'I'm not *allowed* to be happy???' \n\nHe's in King Baby mode - the moving on romantically isn't the issue - no one isn't supportive of it. The issue is he wants it to be easy, frictionless, and uncomplicated, he wants to play fully supported, happy families. He wants what's best for HIM to be best for EVERYONE. \n\nREally, he's learning that he *can* do what he wants, but it will be complicated. I mean, the poor guy is a widower - I sympathise with him. But this is childish emotional reasoning.", "NTA. He asked a question and got honest answers. If that bothers him so much it makes him angry, then he has issues he should definitely go to therapy for.\n\nNow he thinks *you're* the angry person? That's baffling.", "Definitely NTA. You really shouldn't ask children questions you aren't prepared to hear their answers to. My dad asked my brother (5) and I (6) whether we were happy he and my stepmom were getting married a couple weeks before their wedding. She was degrading, a perfectionist, and she made our lives incredibly tense... Normally we wouldn't have the courage to speak negatively, but he specifically asked, so surely he wanted our true opinions, right? And maybe this was a chance to curb the misery that had entered our lives. So we said no and started to say why. He became enraged, said \"Well it's happening!!\", and stomped out of the room.\n\nThat is a core memory for me, and I've often thought about it since I've had my own child.", "NTA. I don't think he's hearing what you're all actually saying, though. He's hearing that his kids/you don't want him to date. Not sure how he's going to hear it without therapy or someone he listens to talking to him.", "NTA. He didn't want honesty when he asked his children. He wanted them to validate his feelings. Their response was incredibly mature, and he should be proud to have children like that. Instead, he got upset because they weren't jumping up and down to meet their \"new mom.\"\n\nHe expected you to agree with him and say his kids were wrong. However, when you pointed out to him that you can see both sides of this, he took this as a betrayal.\n\nHonestly, you suggested therapy for him and I have to agree. It's a shame his children are more mature about this than he is.", "His first mistake was asking his kids how they would feel when it's obvious how they would feel no kid is like \"yeah get someone new and forget mum\" that's just not a thing. \n\nHe should do what makes him happy the end. What grandma decided to do has nothing to do with him so I'm not sure why you keep referencing as if it matters. If grandma decided to be lonely her whole life that her problem and isn't a compelling argument", "NTA and he definitely needs therapy or family counseling. He wants to hear what he wants to hear. Its unreasonable for him to never find love again or be expected to pine for his dead wife for 50 years, but the kids are also young, they probably do not understand the struggles of single parenthood and missing a life partner, they just miss their mom.  14 is not 18 or 20, that is still very young. He cannot expect them to have adult understanding in this situation. \n\nHis responses seem like a mix of selfishness, in not wanting to hear the truth, and possibly guilt over wanting to do the opposite of their wishes. Its the price you pay when you become a parent, their needs>yours. Idk how else you get that point through to him. I'm sure he can get the kids to come around to his side, but its going to take professional help.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not wrong for your brother to want to move on, but he shouldn\u2019t be getting angry that his own children might not yet be over the death of their mother.  He SHOULD be in therapy if the kids sharing their honest feelings makes him that upset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She died, who tf are you to tell your brother, \u201cDon\u2019t go find love, because your kids can\u2019t handle it, just martyr yourself, because why not?\u201d The youngest is 10yr old, his new girl won\u2019t replace their mom, but the kids need to learn that humans aren\u2019t meant to live alone. After a love dies there is a mourning stage ofc, but he decided he was ready to peruse love again. And what did you do? Try to guilt trip him with his own kids? Lord I\u2019m glad your not related to me. Props to your brother for getting away from you.", "NTA. He didn't want honesty from anyone.\n\n>he would have expected me to say the kids need to see things from his perspective.\n\nWhy? He asked for your opinion and he asked for theirs. Why on earth would three children who have lost their mother see things in the same way as he does? Even if you agreed with him, it wouldn't have changed how they felt.", "He wanted to know why the kids would feel the way they do. They have grown up with a (great) grandma who has never dated or remarried and is happy with her life. The reason I brought her up is that is likely what they thought he would want to do. I don't think either way is right or wrong. It's what works for the person. But I do think looking at grandma would explain some of what they think and feel.", "Agreed therapy is very useful and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak. Death is super hard to deal with and talking about it is so important.", "Did you read the post?", "I never ever told him to stay single or not date again. I told him he deserved to date if he wanted to, I just said I understood where the kids are coming from. Outside of him the experience they have is of grandma and they look up to how she feels. I don't think it's wrong for him to feel differently. But I understand why they hoped he would be like her.", "NTA. He didn't want honesty or opinions but approval. He either lacks empathy or is just an ass.", "He shouldn't care what they think he's not dating his kids. He's not dating grandma either her life choices have zero baring on what he should do. \n\nHe shouldn't have asked the kids in the first place. Mums gone and they're old enough to understand that. If he wanted to discuss if the new partner is okay for them that's different. Discussing if he should he alone forever because that is what grandma did is nonsensical at best", "I did, I stand by my opinion. Nothing I stated was a \u201cfact\u201d you\u2019re welcome to disagree. \u270c\ufe0f", "No you said be like our mom, alone. That\u2019s what he heard, that\u2019s how I understood it. Sure you added more words, the message was the same.", "I don't think that's exactly what he was wanting to discuss with them. I think he was trying to figure out how soon they would be comfortable with meeting her and he was hoping for some kind of excitement. Not the most realistic but it's different for everyone. His best friend growing up was excited to meet his mom's boyfriend after his dad died. But another friend of theirs was angry about it. I think he wanted to do it right so the kids didn't have a bad reaction. Clearly he wasn't prepared for what they said in the end.", "Did you miss the part where he told his brother he \"deserved to find happiness and love\". I think you missed that sentence completely.", "It's our grandma and no, I never said that he should be alone. I would never say that. I was just trying to help him understand why his kids had the feelings they did, since that's what he was struggling with.", "Their reaction is the most likely most people aren't excited for new people they don't know joining the family.\n\nHe should have just presented it as this is someone I care about and they're going to be around.. They aren't replacing mum. After be a bunch of meets, then you ask the kids how they be feel about the person, and their answer will be based on more than just feelings of \"replacing mum\". \n\nThat would have been the smart thing to do. Basically don't ask kids for permission. Ask only if they like the person or not but a relationship is something he wants so it's happening end of", "No I read that. That was what I referenced to using extra words. Seems you didn\u2019t understand what I was saying, nor why I said it. My opinion remains."]}
