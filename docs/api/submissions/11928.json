Mal's wife passed away four years ago from an asthma attack. Two years after she passed Mal started dating again. Casually at first, but several months ago he met a woman he wants a more serious relationship with. He told his kids about her and after a few weeks of them knowing he sat them down and asked them to be honest about their feelings on him finding someone, and dating. His older two told him they were sad he wanted to be with someone else, and that they wished he was more like grandma (mine and my brother's grandma to be specific) and was happy with the idea of their mom being his one and only like grandma felt grandpa was her one and only. They did say they would be happy for him. But that was how they felt. The youngest said they felt weird about someone maybe marrying him because they didn't want anyone taking their mom's position in the family.\n\nMy brother was a lot of different things after that talk. Agitated, frustrated and even angry. He was talking to me about it and I could see how he was responding. I suggested that he should think of it as positive that the kids want to support and be happy for him even with their feelings and that he should be proud they could speak openly to him, because many kids might have lied because they didn't feel safe to be open.\n\nThis did not help. After a couple of more weeks he was still in that same state. I suggested he speak to a therapist and he snapped at me, told me he didn't need a therapist because he knew how he was feeling. I didn't argue with him.  Then after a few hours he called and said therapy wasn't needed and he was fine.\n\nThe next day he came to my house and asked me why I was so unbothered by it all. I asked him what he meant and he told me he would have expected me to say the kids need to see things from his perspective. I told him I could see both their points. That he was entitled and deserved to find happiness and love if he wanted that. That they had known grandma their whole lives and have heard how much she loved grandpa and never wanted another man after him, even after 50 years of him being gone, and it didn't shock me that they would want him to feel the same about their mom, because they loved both of them just as much as each other and in their ideal world nobody else could compare for him, just like it's probably that way for them with her. He became so angry and told me I shouldn't want to deny him happiness in his life. I told him to stop and consider that if he was reacting that negatively to what I was saying, how had he reacted to his kids, because all the things I said about the kids feeling comfortable being honest with him would go out the window if he expressed all that anger at them for being honest, when *he* *asked* for their honest feelings.

Maybe I should have offered more understanding to him instead of what I did. I feel like saying what I did, and telling him the kids might change toward him, was wrong, because I don't actually know if he has shown the kids how he feels. He has shown me, an adult.

You really shouldn't ask children questions you aren't prepared to hear their answers to. My dad asked my brother (5) and I (6) whether we were happy he and my stepmom were getting married a couple weeks before their wedding. She was degrading, a perfectionist, and she made our lives incredibly tense... Normally we wouldn't have the courage to speak negatively, but he specifically asked, so surely he wanted our true opinions, right? And maybe this was a chance to curb the misery that had entered our lives. So we said no and started to say why. He became enraged, said \"Well it's happening!!\", and stomped out of the room.\n\nThat is a core memory for me, and I've often thought about it since I've had my own child. I feel for these kids.\n\nEdit: I should've stated originally that my situation was brought about by my parents' divorce rather death", "NTA.

Not sure how he's going to hear it without therapy or someone he listens to talking to him.", "NTA. He didn't want honesty when he asked his children. He wanted them to validate his feelings. Their response was incredibly mature, and he should be proud to have children like that. Instead, he got upset because they weren't jumping up and down to meet their \"new mom.\"\n\nHe expected you to agree with him and say his kids were wrong. However, when you pointed out to him that you can see both sides of this, he took this as a betrayal.\n\nHonestly, you suggested therapy for him and I have to agree. It's a shame his children are more mature about this than he is.", "[deleted]", "NTA and he definitely needs therapy or family counseling. He wants to hear what he wants to hear. Its unreasonable for him to never find love again or be expected to pine for his dead wife for 50 years, but the kids are also young, they probably do not understand the struggles of single parenthood and missing a life partner, they just miss their mom.  14 is not 18 or 20, that is still very young. He cannot expect them to have adult understanding in this situation. \n\nHis responses seem like a mix of selfishness, in not wanting to hear the truth, and possibly guilt over wanting to do the opposite of their wishes. Its the price you pay when you become a parent, their needs>yours. Idk how else you get that point through to him. I'm sure he can get the kids to come around to his side, but its going to take professional help.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not wrong for your brother to want to move on, but he shouldn\u2019t be getting angry that his own children might not yet be over the death of their mother.

If he has processed it, the question is relevant. \n\nThe way both you and his children have expressed things is entirely respectful and healthy, but he seems to latch onto niche aspects of what is said, contort it, and make it fit a sense of outrage he is determined to feel.

He is already dating and is already with someone he wants to get serious with. I don't see him walking away from the relationship and I don't think he should. His goal was to figure out how best to introduce the kids to her.

And he does not have the right to be angry that his children have feelings about a situation they are immediately involved in.", "NTA", "NTA firstly, you sound like you\u2019re looking out for everyone here. If you didn\u2019t tell your brother, would anyone else? \n\nMy two cents:\n\nI was 14 when my own mother passed on. She was sick a while and my siblings were 10, 2 and 1.\n\nMy dad dated here and there but we never met any of his dates. My siblings were happy not to know, I was curious.\n\nWhen his current fianc\u00e9e came into our lives a few years ago, my siblings were 6-15 ish. The eldest acted out emotionally. The youngest two played up for attention.\n\nMy dad had many conversations with us all about how HE felt and how WE felt. What we ALL wanted.\n\nHe told us he was lonely and missed our mum but that he wanted to live for many many years more and would like company into his old age. Someone to enjoy his life with. My parents were 40 when my mum passed. He had HALF his entire life left to live.\n\nIt took us a while but we all grew into a new normal. Kids from both sides get along fine now with no arguing. Everyone is content.\n\nWe all miss our mum. His fianc\u00e9e will never be our mum. But she\u2019s the woman my dad is now sharing his life with. He loves her and wants to be with her. She\u2019s kind and she\u2019s funny and she tells our dad off when he\u2019s out of order! I\u2019m glad we all get along.\n\nDo we want someone to replace our mum? No. Do we wish my dad would love my mum til he died? Who said he doesn\u2019t? \n\nEnd of the day, my dad loves my mum still. He visits her on her birthday and on Mother\u2019s Day and on her death day. We go sometimes at Easter or Valentine\u2019s Day but it\u2019s not all encompassing. I\u2019m glad my dad has moved on. I miss my mum something terribly. But I also love my dads fianc\u00e9e. She never took on a parenting role or moved into our home. But she helps me when I ask and she talks to me when I need.\n\nMy dad went to hospital recently and we were all scared he wasn\u2019t going to make it. She was the only one at his bedside 24/7 when his own family were busy having a pissing contest. His mum tried to stop his own kids coming to see him and his fianc\u00e9e - the woman we didn\u2019t want to replace mum - SHE is the only one who stuck up for us and made my Nan step down. We may never have got to see him for the last time had things gone sour if she never stepped in.\n\nThe one who was most upset about the fianc\u00e9e was my brother, who is now 14. He was an angry child and was often physically violent and verbally abusive. He hated all of us. He was my mum\u2019s baby boy as she only had girls before and after him. He missed her terribly despite being so young and he acted out horribly. He\u2019s more understood now and he\u2019s been more understanding. He doesn\u2019t cosy up to the fianc\u00e9e or seek her out but he respects her. He respects that my dad loves her. \n\nSometimes our feelings are big and that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s my experience. It sounds to me like your brother needn\u2019t worry. His children sound far more accepting than we were as children.\n\nTell him to explain his feelings calmly and then spend a day with just him and the kids doing something their mum would do, maybe visiting her too at some point.

Honestly, working through the relationship with a potential new stepmother is an important part of this, any child will feel the same way under these circumstances.

If you want to the gym and just casually started free weights with an intention without consulting an expert, you risk getting hurt (or not stretching right, building not all the right muscles, etc).\n\nSame holds true for complex emotional events, such as death of a loved one and dating again. It\u2019s hopefully something most people don\u2019t go through frequently, so why not consult an expert (therapist) to help ensure you\u2019re doing it the best you can?\n\nESPECIALLY since he has children.

Thing is as parent you need to do right by your kids first. If that means they don't want a new person in the house to take mom's place that means she can't move in. The children should always come first. Now that doesn't mean he can't have a serious relationship with this woman. Just not bring her into the kid's lives because they don't want that or just aren't ready.\n\nTherapy can definitely help the kids learn how to cope with their grief better if still needed. Some need a really long time toove through the different stages.", "I think he\u2019s more frustrated with you because he came to you for empathy and support and you were just flippant about the situation.

Most children want their parents to be together and they don\u2019t like their parent being with another person. \n\nI think that he should probably keep dating this woman and maybe another month down the line ask different questions to the children, like whether they like the person and whether she\u2019s nice to them. \nIf she\u2019s a good person and they get along, that\u2019s important. She won\u2019t replace their mum and that\u2019s not the point. \n\nThe kids input is important in terms of selecting a partner who treats them well but the kids should not decide whether dad ever dates again or not.", "Honestly, I think he's feeling guilty himself and maybe has other unresolved feelings that he's projecting onto his family, unable to see that therapy could do a whole lot of good for him in this situation.", "He\u2019s going to end up lashing out at his kids about this.

OP also did call him out on his negative reactions to the kids' statements as well as OP's own. They can't force the brother into therapy, but OP could suggest it separately for the kids. \n\nIt also says something about the brother's parenting if the kids were so open about their feelings that they spoke up about them honestly. There has to be something more about this that makes him angry, & you'd be most likely right that it stems off from the grief that he seemed to not fully process up until this point. He could be clamming up & depending on this one woman to save himself from his own grief & fully expecting for his kids to also be on board. He may equate this new relationship as a stepping stone to moving forward from his late wife, or something new to forget about his grief entirely. \n\nOverall, it seems that the kids & the brother are at an impasse due to different interpretations. Good on the kids for being honest & good on the dad for creating that open & honest environment to do so in the first place. Lots of kids would just not say anything in fear of offending their parents.

Yes, he should seek therapy along with his children how to move forward and retain open and good relationships with each other.  But, no one should compare your brother to your grandmother.  Just because one chose to remain alone does not mean everyone should do the same.  The children are young and do not understand completely what that means.  Right now, of course, they want to remember  the family unit.  But one day, the children will grow up and have family\u2019s of their own and will move out of the home from dad. What about dad then?

The fact that they didn't say \"yes, absolutely!!\" is upsetting him.  The next hurdle he's going to have to face is that the kids won't see their new step-mom as a replacement mom, and your brother sounds like he might be the person who forces them to call her mom.", "NTA.

Neither kids nor OP actually suggested he's not allowed to date yet this is what he projects onto them, when they didn't give him 100% enthusiastic blessing he was looking for. Those are his own feelings he's projecting onto kids and OP. And aggressive denial is par for the course here.\n\nHe does need therapy, bc he's on the best way to screw up his relationship with his kids as well as kids relationship with whomever he might date in future and also bc ITS NOT KIDS' JOB TO VALIDATE THEIR PARENTS FEELINGS AND PARENTS EXPECTING THAT ARE ROYALLY FUCKING UP THE JOB OF PARENTING.", "Your brother sounds unhinged.

Oftentimes, the thing we get so angry about others' actions or behaviors is something we're guilty of our own selves. Also, there could be other factors at play, maybe friends or coworkers getting on him about it telling him it's time to move on or that he should be over it by now. It's sad, but people do that kind of thing.

So I would think with him it might be disappointment, shame, grief... Would be beneficial to explore what is really going on. Validating people helps regulate them.

Some caregivers choose not to have relationships, some because of their profession, because they have pets, etc. \n\nIt seems he could continue to see this person quietly for a while and allow his kids more time to get used to her, process their feelings, etc. Unless the lady is pressuring him (which isn't a good sign), he probably just needs to slow down.", "NTA\n\nThis conflict he's having is completely internal, but he's displacing all his anger onto innocent kids who did exactly what he asked of them.\n\nNobody is denying him anything. He needs to realize that not everybody has to agree with his choices to love and support him regardless of them.\n\nHe also needs to be gentle with his children. They lost their mother, someone who, to them, is irreplaceable. It is understandable that they would be afraid of this new person trying to replace her. They need reassurance, not chiding for being truthful.\n\nIt sounds like he could benefit from seeing a therapist to learn to deal with his grief and anger in healthier ways, but unfortunately, you can't make someone want help.", "NTA.  I think you are right that he needs therapy,  He seems to only be able to see his own point of view and has no empathy for his children.", "NTA. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want him to be happy. You simply stated that you could see all points of view and you explained how his kids felt. \n\nHim being upset by this means that he should go to therapy to find out why he is so bothered by how his kids felt. Because if he is waiting for his kids approval to move on, then he\u2019s barking up the wrong tree. In fact the whole family needs therapy if dad is going to start dating again. But it sounds like the kids are on board with the idea, but they understand it\u2019s not their preferred scenario. And that\u2019s okay. \n\nAlso, alternatively, he is wanting to be one of those parents that forces a \u201cnew mom\u201d on their kids and that in itself is a requirement of therapy. There are a lot of feelings here. And all but one of the ones I listed are completely normal. \n\nTherapy\u2019s is definitely needed, though. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for saying it.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re angry so much as stands g up for the kids and staying facts. He\u2019s projecting.\n\nAlso adding, therapy isn\u2019t to know how you feel, but to sort out how you feel, identify why and work on that. Maybe explain it that way?", "NTA. He's handling this badly (not the dating, but the talking to his kids), and you're trying to be kind.\n\nAs a side note, he is moving on pretty quickly. His wife has been gone two years, and for a lot of people, the second year without a loved one is the hardest. The first year nothing feels normal and everyone expects you to be sad, the second year you start to really see the shape of \"they will never be here for xmas, ever, again\", \"they are never going to joke about the crop of rocks when they prep their garden, ever again\", \"they're never going to eatch our kid forget their lines and ad lib in a achool play, ever again\" *and* everyone further out from the loss is tired of you being sad.  So he and his kids have just been through this brutal stage of grief. \n\nIt's not surprising that he wants a new connection to blunt the lonlieness that comes with grief, but it's also not surprising that the kids are hurt that their mom isn't as special and irreplaceable to their dad as she was to them.\n\nI've read that widowed women tend to be slower to remarry (if they remarry at all) regardless of whether the marriage was good or bad, and that widowed men tend to remarry fairly quickly if the marriage was good. If all the kids have seen is grandma's example, I can see how they'd be hurt by dad looking so quickly, much less finding a new serious partner so soon. \n\nHe's allowed to want to move on, or to see lonlieness and grief as two seperate issues, but he needs to accept that his kids don't have to be enthusiastic about it.", "NAH. Your brother isn't seeing things clearly at this point. Which is normal. What his kids and himself have in commen is that they see the situation primarily from their *own* perspectives.

Im 25 years old and I can\u2019t imagine my dad wanting to move on with someone else. It is my greatest fear. And it is extremely selfish. But I worry about it every day. Those kids handled it maturely and your brother sucks, irrespective of wanting to move on. He clearly doesn\u2019t care about how the kids feel, he cares about how they make him feel.", "NTA.. I feel sorry for your brother but, why would he ask them if he was expecting a specific answer and not actually wanting to hear what they had to say? Sad situation all around", "NTA your advocating for his kids. But if he\u2019s this pissed with you I\u2019m imagine how angry he will be with the kids.", "NTA of course the kids are apprehensive about it. His unwillingness to hear anything from them but complete acceptance is troubling. I hope he didn\u2019t tell them that they are getting a new Mama.

I hope he doesn\u2019t expect the kids to call her Mom, etc. Therapy would help him.", "NTA \n\nI also am about to give the exact opposite of the advice I give 90% of the time. For once, you should take the chances afforded to keep suggesting therapy. I usually tell people they need to lay off pushing it on people who are resistant, but in this case, this is much more about what his kids need than him. Even if therapy doesn't help him decide how he feels, it may help him understand how his kids feel. Their mom and dad were the absolute center of their universe. It sounds to me like his desires for himself are reasonable, but his expectations for his kids are not. They seem like good kids, but truthfully he needs some help getting the last bits of their trauma out in the open and getting to a point he can understand that their grief and his are not the same. It never will be. It may be (and I hope it is) equal, but that still doesn't make it the same.", "I had a stroke reading the title", "NAH - the entire family needs to go to grief counseling both together as a family and individually.", "NTA. You sound like the only sane adult in your family, OP. It scares me that your brother reacted so poorly and was still so angry about his kids very normal reactions even weeks later. Why even ask them if he\u2019s just going to take offense and not actually hear them. It made me happy to know that the kids felt safe answering his questions and saying how they felt, but I\u2019m worried about how he may have made them feel. Of course they want their mom to be his one and only. They\u2019re little and don\u2019t understand these things and is is a very romantic thing to hold your partner in that esteem long after they\u2019re gone, so I see the appeal. All they want is to be safe and loved and not have anything threaten that. This man needs therapy or I really fear what\u2019s it come for those babies when he decides he wants her to move in. Please look out for those sweet babies OP!", "There probably isn\u2019t anything you can do to get through to him.  He\u2019s going to have to figure this out on his own.

OP, *please* tell your brother, again, how getting angry at them for sharing the opinions he asked for *WILL* damage his relationship with his kids.

He can't then say that their feelings are not valid. He wanted you to tell him he's right and the kids are wrong so that he can railroad over them, but the thing is that everyone's feelings are right. He's allowed to want to move on, the kids are allowed to feel that they don't want a new 'mum' figure in their lives. Part of the problem is that the role that this woman would fill, he is feeling lonely and craves intimacy, for the kids, they would feel that this woman would be trying to take mum's place. I don't usually jump to this, but therapy/family therapy might help", "What he wanted with honesty is the kids to tell him what he wanted to hear.

I had young kids.  I told my husband that I expected him to move on and find someone else.  I told my father that I wanted my husband to move on, and he should make introductions if the opportunity arose - I did this mainly because I didn't want him kicking up a stink and making life difficult.\n\nIt's great that the kids feel that they can speak freely to their Dad, but they also need to understand that what they are asking is selfish.  The kids are the ones who need therapy.", "NTA.. It's pretty disheartening to see how dismissive the comments are on this guy's feelings. He needs therapy and support. His kids feelings are totally valid too, but expecting him to remain single the rest of his life is not a reasonable expectation.", "I mean if he was going to totally disregard the kids feelings what was the point in asking them?

I'm sort of seeing this from a different angle. What if he isn't really mad at his kids, but mad at himself? What if he is feeling severe guilt for falling for this woman and he is looking for his kids to sort of back him up on it. Give him an out. \"No Dad, we'll never accept her. We don't want you to see her anymore!\" He could very well be angry because he is so torn and his anger is misplaced. Might be something to consider, maybe bring up with him.", "NTA .

Your brother definitely needs therapy, because he can\u2019t seem to understand what anyone around him is actually saying. He\u2019s responding so defensively that it makes me wonder whether HE felt weird about dating again, sought approval from family to assuage his guilt, and then got angry the approval wasn\u2019t enthusiastic enough. It\u2019s not cool to ask someone for their honest feelings and then punish them for not feeling the way he wants them to.", "Nta. But stay out of it from here out.

Sounds like he\u2019s still grieving and having doubts himself about moving on and is looking for a reason not too.  I agree that grief counseling would be good for him, but I would not push it.  Might be best to let time work it\u2019s way and just provide support.", "I guess for him to attain \u201chappiness\u201d, all of his kids and you should accept his new partner as a replacement for his dead wife which is just unreasonable. NTA", "NTA because it sounds like you were pretty compassionate. From what I read, there\u2019s some pretty awesome things here. First, the kids expressed their feelings and did see his side in that they expressed they would be happy for him even if they had a personal preference for a different reality. That\u2019s pretty mature and loving for kids. They want him happy even if it\u2019s different from what they pictured. \n\nSo it sounds less like he\u2019s angry that they don\u2019t see his side and more that he\u2019s angry they\u2019re not 100% in line with him. That maybe he had some kind of worry or insecurity he was hoping they would fix with unwavering support. If he does engage you again with this topic, OP, I suggest asking some why questions. \u201cWhy do you feel this way?\u201d \u201cWhy do you want them to have unconditional support?\u201d \u201cWhy ask for honesty if you don\u2019t like them having a different perspective?\u201d\n\nAnd another good thing to mention in general is feelings are always valid. It\u2019s okay he\u2019s angry that they aren\u2019t fully on board! That\u2019s what he feels. What isn\u2019t always valid is what one does with one\u2019s feelings. If he were to yell at them, for example- his anger is still valid. His action isn\u2019t. Therapy might be a good pitch again from this angle- he has a lot of feelings and his family is in a transition period. A therapist will give him room to be angry, help him figure out ways to help his kids have a healthy relationship with him and the fact that he\u2019s dating, and won\u2019t be as close to the situation as you. Objectivity!\n\nFinally, I wonder how old Grandma was when Grandpa died. If Grandma was in her 50\u2019s or older, that\u2019s something that can very kindly be expressed to the kids- that Grandma got a lot more time with Grandpa than Brother did and she knew there was less time ahead of her to be alone. That if it was switched, and Mom was still there and he had passed, Brother would want her to have the help and love in her life instead of missing him all the time. That it\u2019s okay his kids feel the way they do, and it\u2019s so good that in the end, they want him happy. Good luck. This is rough.", "NTA. Your brother needs to work on his listening skills. What he\u2019s hearing isn\u2019t what anyone is saying in this case. He absolutely needs therapy, not to identify how he\u2019s feeling, but to navigate those feelings and respond in a way that doesn\u2019t totally tank his relationship with his kids.", "NTA - Something that you said and the kids said is that you both understand him and his wants and feelings. You just don't agree with him. THAT'S why he's angry. Your brother WANTS you to agree with him. He wants the kids to agree with him. That way he can date freely and be able to say, \"well you agreed with me so you can't take that back now\". Your brother doesn't want understanding, he wants permission and no one is giving him that so it angers him because now he will feel guilt and he doesn't want to feel guilt for wanting to date and find someone new.", "NTA - recommend family therapy for everyone. Dad needs to understand how the kids feel (and he asked for it as if he expected something different so clearly he does not understand how his kids feel). The kids need to understand that Dad has the right to move on but need validation if they don't feel ready for this yet. They expressed their preference that he stay single, and that shows they need help accepting that he should be allowed to move on. The fact that he got angry is simply his frustration that he doesn't know how to help his kids to allow him to move on. Professional help for everyone here.", "NTA He needs to consider his children's feelings not just his", "Nah.\n\nI get that you're not really doing anything wrong, but your brother lost his wife and now his children and family are basically telling him how they'd prefer that he deny himself love and intimacy with another person for the rest of his life.\n\nIt's understandable coming from very young children to a degree, but can you blame him for being angry?\n\nSo he needs to raise 3 kids completely by himself and also never have anyone to love or care about again. Should he weep for his deceased wife each night before bed to complete the picture?\n\nHe probably does need therapy given everything he's gone though but I can't call him an asshole for how he's reacting.", "NAH- I understand where you are coming from. Can't say I feel the same way about grandma though. Nothing worse than the logic of not wanting to be with someone else once grandpa is gone. It teaches kids a horrible lesson.

The only lesson you teach children is that their happiness isn't important enough to fight for. \n\nLife is short and finding happiness is difficult. My mom and dad divorced when I was 9 years old and I've always been so disappointed that my mother never really gave love another shot. She found jesus and i guess that's been enough for her. But it completely turned me away from religion. \n\nI think that saying you see it both ways was a little poor on your part. Bc your brother is absolutely right and there is no way he should be allowing children who don't understand how lonely things can be as an adult to dictate a decision like this. I don't think you're an asshole bc you were just being honest. But I think the opinion in itself is very flawed. I would have just said that it's something they'll have to learn to accept.", "NTA.

You understanding both sides is very logical. He seems to take that as some kind of betrayal. You were correct to suggest therapy, he needs it. His emotions seem to be in overdrive and he's not thinking logically.\n\nAlso, I don't understand why people associate being alone with being lonely. Not everyone feels the need to be with someone. Some are very happy being by themselves.", "YTA He deserves to move on and no one should be held hostage by their children. The story of their grandmother being alone for 50 years is SAD and awful. She probably needed therapy and to move on. \n\nYou should support your brother, he is right, he deserves to move on. Sounds like he\u2019s probably still young enough for an entire wonderful next chapter in his life. We ALL deserve this chance. \n\nKids grow up and move away and make their own lives. \n\nDo you want him to be sad and alone with an empty house and heart for his entire life to placate children that are too young to understand the reality of adult life and the situation? Let alone the damage they would cause to his entire life and future without understanding at all just what they are actually asking of & doing to their Dad?\n\nI would be angry at you too. He did listen to his kids and is taking them into his decision, but that doesn\u2019t mean he should be held hostage by his children for the rest of his life bc they are too young to understand. Maybe the women would be a great influence and a healing influence for them all. It happens every day!\n\nThey could all use therapy. We could all use it.

The kids seem to have the idea their mother is going to be 'replaced' which should be explored properly so when the dad ends up with someone new, they know how to manage a new, blended family and maintain boundaries. \n\nThe kids also might find it beneficial to go to grief counselling and process their emotions and everything going on more fully; they were very young when their mother died, they might not have fully understood it or processed their feelings at the time. And it may help them understand their dad's perspective. I lost my dad when I was 14, and I was so glad when my mom and stepdad started getting serious. I still love my father, and I know my mom still loves him. But she's incredibly happy with her new husband, and who would I be to stand in the way of that after everything she's done for us? We had family friends distance themselves over it and honestly, I've always considered it incredibly selfish that they would think their feelings are more important than my mother's happiness. Now, obviously it's different when you're the kids, but that's why I think they'd benefit from individual and family therapy. To have a safe space to explore everyone's feelings and understand each other's perspectives.", "Agreed. My guess? He's probably struggling with cognitive dissonance, and his kids words mirrored the same going through his head. If I lost my husband, even a decade later, I know fully I would struggle internally with feeling like I was betraying them by enjoying another relationship. When you build a healthy partnership and a family with someone, you have a framework laid out in your mind for what the rest of your life looks like, more or less. Losing that partner violates those expectations, but doesn't change the roadmap. You'll be simultaneously holding the joy of the new relationship in your hand, with the grief of an empty seat beside you still loudly there, and that feels wrong and off.\n\nThere are NAH in my opinion, though. OPs brother isn't an asshole for struggling to process his children's feelings on this relationship along with his own. Honestly him sitting down and asking his children what they felt is such a beautiful sign; he doesn't like the answer, and he's struggling with it and it will take time and work, but he cares enough and is emotionally sensitive enough to them to ask in the first place, and he cares so much about them that their negative response is tearing him up. How many parents have we read about on this subreddit who do not seek out their children's feelings in situations similar to this? Or worse, push a narrative ONTO their children along with the relationship? OPs brother is not acting perfectly in this situation, but nobody is perfect.", "Especially because the children's honest feelings are \"We are sad that you are moving on from our mom and wish you could be happy without a partner, but we want you to be happy and will be happy for you\".

Hi, OP, I think your brother needs some therapy to sort things out and good advice how to adress things with his children. \"Yes, for Grandma it was enough to live with a memory, but not all people are alike. Yes, me finding a partner would add an additional adult to our family, but nobody will ever replace your mom and you will not be forced to see her as a mom.\" It is really important to realise that there are many aspects to every fact, to talk about all those aspects, to word things clearly and to express ones needs and feelings. Your brother seems to be insecure how to proceed and wanted his family to encourage him. He really needs some help to back him up and to navigate through this whilst taking good care of his childrens feelings, too.", "I can't imagine how hurtful it must have been to hear from his own children they actively wished he would stay single and lonely. They didn't just say they were uncomfortable with the idea or that they still missed their mom a lot and weren't ready to meet anyone he dated yet, they told him to his face they didn't want him to date anyone, ever.\n\nBy 14 years old, kids need to understand that their parents are autonomous human beings with their own needs and wants and not extensions of themselves.

He knows asking and acknowledging his children's opinion was the right thing to do, he just most likely didn't realize or expect how he would react to the 'wrong' answer. \n\nGuy's struggling with guilt and internalized patriarchal ideas about not appearing weak.
