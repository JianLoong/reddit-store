He can't say it, so what? he's not talking to you anyway'', both my brother and my mom looked at me, but my SIL said ''I was just helping'' but I said 'No, you're being rude, how many languages do you speak to be correcting someone?'', my dad took my hand and smiled, but things got awkward and they left, my brother is demanding I apologize because I was an Ah, my dad doesn't think I should do it and my mom is not sure, so idk AITA?", "created_utc": 1668570980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywj0lk/aita_telling_my_sil_that_she_was_being_a_bitch/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When people interject to correct someone else's conversation, it's rude. Plain and simple imo. \n\nAlso, what good could possibly come of your SILs correction? She isn't part of the conversation, there were no comprehension issues, and it literally just points out someone's struggle. It serves no purpose other than making her feel superior. She owes your dad an apology.", "NTA she wasn\u2019t just being rude as hell, she was being racist. Your mom is not sure because she doesn\u2019t want a rift to occur in the family, but that\u2019s not an excuse. The fact that your brother let (and continues to let) his wife treat your family that way and then continuously embarrass your father like that says so much about him as a person.\nDO NOT apologize & if I was your mother I\u2019d be putting my foot down & refuse to let your brother & his shit wife over until they both apologized- her for her behaviour & him for allowing her to act like that towards his family", "Absolutely the fuck not! NTA. People like this drive me up a wall. Do you know how hard it is to learn and use one language let alone 2?! She is a pretentious asshole and your brother should be ashamed that he is allowing his wife to continue to disrespect his family like this. You do not owe her an apology and if they keep asking for it tell them to go fuck themselves in Spanish lol", "NTA.  She's correcting someone who didn't ask to be corrected and she only has one language? Please. If he'd asked for corrections (as I frequently do), that's one thing. But if he doesn't think you should apologize, that absolutely did not happen.  Screw her. Y tambien, cuando te disculpes, disculpate en Arabe.

As someone who speaks english as second language I have a strong accent. Or at least that's what people tell me. I don't hear it myself and therefore don't quite know how I would have to modulate my inflection to get rid of it and the mispronunciations that happen because of it. Your SIL was rude and condescending.", "NTA, you are 100% right.", "You don't need to apologize for for anything sil was just being plain rude and disrespectful to your father in his own home.", "NTA - English is spoken in many places and there\u2019s a lot of different accents. Even if you wanted to limit it to just the US - someone from Boston, Chicago, and Houston for example are probably all going to pronounce certain words differently.\n\nThere was no reason to correct him. There was enough other context clues to figure out what he meant.", "NTA. The one that needs to apologize is your SIL.\n\nEDIT: And you don't need to always speak English around her, especially if your conversation is a side one without her involvement (and she's talking to someone else).", "NTA \n\nI have multilingual friends who asked me to correct them so they can improve. Them I correct. \n\nAnyone else, if you understand what they are saying, STFU!!!\n\nIf you repeat the correction over and over again, you are always TA!!!", "NTA. What your SIL was doing was not 'helping'. Correcting someone doesn't mean you get a pass for being rude about it.", "Get her, Jade. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf bro and her keep insisting, if anything throw them a \"I'm sorry I called you a bitch (cause it's not nice to dogs)\", but you do not need to apologize for calling our her behaviour and sticking up for your dad. I think you did an absolutely noble thing, and I'm sure even the bitch comment was justified based off just the story.", "NTA. Clear she wants to be the absolute smartest person to everyone she knows. She was probably a teacher's pet in school too.", "absolutely not.  she is the one who should apologize and your brother is a wuss for not backing you up and telling her she\u2019s wrong.  especially since she was embarrassing your Dad\n\nnot only should you not apologize- since you\u2019ve opened the door, you might as well step all the way in\n \ntell her (without being mean or judgmental) that she probably doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s doing it, but you\u2019ve noticed that she corrects people often and it\u2019s off putting.  if somebody asks for help - great.  but if not, unless it\u2019s a matter of life and death, she should keep her corrections to herself", "NTA\n\nMy kids did this when they were young (under 5). I think because they're frequently being corrected as they learn the language they don't realise it's not the most important part of every social interaction. \n\nThis doesn't apply to your SIL though, she just likes being the importance that comes with being correct rather than having socially appropriate interactions.", "NTA your comment was perfect", "NTA. If she could understand him, then why should she care? You should never correct someone's speaking unless it's causing a communication error/breakdown and even then you should do it gently and with subtlety esp if you are correcting an elder family member.", "NTA. If she's so smart, why can't she learn Spanish? Do not, under any circumstances, apologize to her.", "NTA. She should apologized for not letting it go since clearly everyone knew what he meant, especially her since she was correcting him (therefore still understanding him)\n\nAnd for those saying she was an AH or rude for calling her a bitch, this has been a constant thing and this situation was probably the last straw. I probably see it this way because I would\u2019ve done the same thing so hey, maybe I\u2019m an ass too :)", "Truthfully, you were sorta the ass but you get upvoted to NTA for RIGHTEOUSNESS AND STYLE!", "NTA. As a monolingual person, I admire people who can speak two languages. Your dad's English could still be understood in the context and she was being patronising, to the point of making him embarrassed and feeling relieved when you defended him. I usually correct my parents' pronunciations (they are immigrants) because I know them well enough to but I wouldn't correct a stranger's. Even my husband doesn't correct my parents, he'll just ask me later if he didn't understand something.", "NTA. It was a little harsh but she could have quit while she was ahead, she pushed until she had to be told to stop. Hopefully she learns to be nice in the future", "NTA", " NTA! I would be proud of you as a sibling or a father! Way to go, for your family!", "NTA\n\nNot only did she correct your dad but she also corrected you and her brother. She has no business correcting anybody.", "NTA I read every line in Gloria\u2019s voice", "NTA - the absolute best way to apologize would be gifting her a shirt with \u2018asshole\u2019 translated into a bunch of languages printed all over for Christmas. But I\u2019ve been known to be the pretty petty.", "NTA, she needs to learn that her comments are inappropriate and rude AF!!", "Uh un. Nope. I was really trying to find a way to tell you to continue being gracious and supportive of your brother's wife. But heck no. She is a prime a hat. Rude *and* condescending to your dad in his home? Nooooooooo. Your brother should explain to his wife privately that no one enjoys her rudeness and no one besides him signed up tp tolerate it.\n\nYou were kinder than the situation called for, frankly.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Jesus. She sounds incredibly rude.", "NTA!", " Seriously though NTA No le debes absolutamente nada excepto una r\u00e1pida patada en el trasero.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your dad.", "NTA, what she did had nothing to do with helping but with feeling like the smartest person and embarrass him.", "NTA!", "NTA. Keep doing that. Compare their Spanish to here's OH WAIT.... It'll be for the best. She'll need to get it through her head to succeed in this family.", "NTA. As an English speaker who knows maybe ten Spanish words in total, I do not get offended by people speaking it around me. I understand I do not need to be in every conversation. Would it be rude if ALL of you were speaking only Spanish so she's excluded? Yes. For a sub-group to speak it to each other while she is in the room? No. At this point, I would say it needs to be done to make a point.", "NTA\u2026You have nothing to apologize for. Someone had to put her in her place \ud83e\udd2d", "Gentle ESH\n\n> you're being rude\n\nThis \\^\\^ was the correct way to respond to your SIL's poor behavior.\n\n#Don't call women \"bitches\"\n\nIf someone's an asshole, call them an asshole.
