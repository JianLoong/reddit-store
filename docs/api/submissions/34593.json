I asked for a dye job and haircut.\n\nI went in, she sat me on the chair, we talked a little about what I wanted and she then proceeded to start. She cut the hair that was long (reaching half my back) to above my shoulders. She then proceeded with the dye that included washing my hair and then further styling of my hair. \n\nIt looked great and I was very happy, but when she ringed me up, she asked for 300$. My jaw hit the floor because that's almost double the amount I was expected to pay. How so? I asked and she said it was 40$ the cut PLUS 40$ the long hair workmanship, then 120$ the dye PLUS 50$ the washing and styling. I told her that still adds up only to 250$. She said the rest is THE DYE that she used. \n\nI told her I only requested a haircut and a dye job, but she told me the rest is mandatory for those, since she can't dye my hair without washing me. I told her that if this is the case, she should have listed the dye job at the full price- 220, or write somewhere that the washing is mandatory and costs extra. I told her I'm not gonna pay and we had a fight.\n\nShe called me an ah and I called her a scammer. I understand she charged me for her work, but in all honesty, if I knew this would be the full price, I'd have not booked the appointment. As far as I'm concerned, she said she's gonna do a dye job at 120$. She later charges me almost twice for it? Heck no! A friend of mine said I should have known, but HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW what she charges me for since she advertised said prices? Aita? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She gave you a price. All those extras are not even real charges a hairdresser would charge for. You don't charge separately for the dye. That is baked into the total price. And there is no extra charge for cutting long hair. If you didn't pay the extra, let her take you to court. And find a new hairdresser. Oh and NTA.", "NTA, seems to me like if anything she tried to rip you off. It\u2019s a little deceiving to withhold information. What if you weren\u2019t able to afford the appointment? As you said, you would\u2019ve canceled or not booked had you have known. I would\u2019ve paid her what you had originally agreed on, maybe a tad bit more to compromise and then a fair tip. I agree with another comment: give her the money for the work she did, never go back, and leave a review.", "NTA.\n\nIf a price is listed, then that's the price.  If it's going to go beyond that price, she has to inform you before she just tacks it on.  It's the same with getting a car repair done.  They diagnose the problem and give you an estimate.  If they encounter something else that will greatly increase the price, they call to tell you what it is instead of just tacking it on.\n\nI'd report her to the city/county that she's in for fraudulent business practices.", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if possible leave reviews wherever you can. She out and out deceived you. If a wash was mandatory, then that cost should have been disclosed upfront; and same for the other extra costs. I would have paid, but I would have loudly expressed my displeasure and then do everything possible to warn potential customers.", "So how much did you pay?", "NTA. You paid for the work you asked for. They can't keep throwing stuff in expecting you to pay. That is so unacceptable. Probably would have paid as I stated what was wrong about the whole set-up, then took to social media.", "NTA. It is good practice during the consultation prior to doing to work to say how much things will cost. She obviously didn't do that. She also knew you have appointment for specific things that cost specific money, why did she not warn you that the extra items will be needed in addition to them when you were making the appointment or when you were having the consultation. However, you liked the work done and were satisfied by it. If it was me, I would pay but never return to this hairstylist and leave a very detailed review on google/yelp/etc.", "Generally salon prices are listed with a +following the minimum price.  So a color retouch meaning just your roots,  would be $120.  Any additional length will be an additional charge.  This is standard practice.  Charging you to wash the color out of your hair is sketchy af.  Going in with hair down your back and expecting to pay the minimum price is a bit crazy.  However, she should have informed you before she began what additional charges would be and how long it would take.", "NTA, and she sounds like a scammer. She advertised a service for one price and is now creating hidden charges to rip you off. It\u2019s not your job to figure out whatever other charges or services she\u2019s including to inflate the price for her work."]}
