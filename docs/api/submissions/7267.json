Of course you would want to look after the well being of your sister who you are close with and nephew and not some guy you don\u2019t know. What an insane thing to ask someone. NTA, and I would tell your sister about what he is trying to do.", "NTA he had 5 years to save money for a rainy day. Sucks divorce is the rainy day but that's your sister. You owe him nothing", "NTA  \nYour brother-in-law sounds like a very entitled individual.  \nHe\u2019s had the benefit of five years of rent free living from you And now wants to Demand more simply because something went wrong in his marriage and he blames his wife.   \nTough -she\u2019s your sister and he has no claims on you.  \n Now I\u2019m not a big fan of infidelity, it has a tendency to sour everything. Although from the sound of him he doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of person I\u2019d  want to be married to either.   \nMaybe this was the sister\u2019s way of obtaining a divorce she didn\u2019t think she would be granted easily without such grounds", "You're right, sister is an asshole. But like they say: love the sinner, hate the sin.", "Family is still family. I\u2019d be furious with my brother if he cheated on my future sister-in-law, but if his housing was dependent on me and I had a nephew or niece in the picture? You\u2019d better believe he\u2019d be staying right where he was. For then, at least. I might be telling him to start looking into another place because I\u2019m thinking about selling and then go through with it, but I\u2019d never just leave him up a creek.", "Harming your child\u2019s father is harming your child.", "This is not something the OP is in any position to fix or atone for.", "[deleted]", "I am a guy. I am not rewarding anyone. I let my sister live in this house. She got married. Jake got a free housing. They are getting divorced. Things will go back to how they were. Expecting me to kick out my sister for my ex BIL is not reasonable.", "I didn't say that. I said she should have to pay rent, and you should have integrity enough to back up the father in court for the custody situation  as he is at risk BECAUSE of your sister's bad decision.  The divorce is BECAUSE of your sister. He was your family and still is. You cannot have any sort of morals and still support your sister's actions here. I feel you are rewarding her, or ignoring her terrible actions, by going \"back how they were\".", "That's not an OP issue though, the divorce courts will look at that. \n\nFrom the sounds of it BIL hasn't used the past 5 years wisely if he hasn't got enough to scrape a down-payment on rent. Whether sister has been any more sensible than him isn't known.\n\nOP essentially gave the house to his sister in all but deed. It's not a marital asset to be debated in the divorce and BIL can't reasonably expect continued support from his ex's family. OP isn't on the hook to do that.", "The divorce literally isn't OP's problem. OP let his sister live there. That's it. Whether she gets married, divorced or gets a live in boyfriend isn't OP's problem. BIL was only there due to his relationship with OP's sister. OP didn't care either way. From OP's pov, he let his sister live there, and if she has a husband he will also live there. If she no longer has a husband, he won't live there. OP's sister helped OP and she's now reaping the rewards. BIL has no relation to OP nor has done anything to get the rewards.", "Hahaha you are funny. He is not family he is not more than his sister and never you will be. Well you feel wrong, he is neither rewarding nor punishing. Your vision is awful.", "You're right he shouldn't but doesn't make it any less bogus for him. \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Wife was the dirty one and he's the one assed out. I'd be quick to kick mine out\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "If she betrayed OP then OP can punish her. If she betrayed BIL, he can punish her by divorcing. And father of the nibling doesn't make him OP's family. And even if it did, OP said he has been allowing them to stay there because his sister helped him in the past. And it wasn't the BIL's house. It is OP's house. He offered for his sister to live rent free. By your logic, OP should basically pay alimony to the BIL.", "That's really a cynical way to see this. They both reaped the rewards of the op. They should have both saved money to move out of their free ride. Guess what? No one expects to be cheated on. People saying \"he had 5 years to save up\" are a joke, and obviously have zero idea what that feels like. Treating the sister like nothing happened is enabling behavior. Both should be ashamed.", "You are actually wrong, but that's ok. The father of his sister's child makes him...yep, part of the family legally. The fact that you defend her tells me a lot about your character, or lack thereof.", "I agree with you staying by your sister side, doesnt matter what she did, in the end she is your family not him, but lets be real, you sister didnt have any consequenses, she destroyed your BIL life by not only cheating on him but let him ''homeless''(he can stay with their parents but still isnt the same) and in the end she will have their son full custody, the unique thing she will lose is her husband who she was cheating on, so infact she is losing nothing, unfortunely life is not fair, its not your fault anyways, NTA", "I am not defending anyone but if you throw a sister that had help you in the past the streets for someone you don't have nor will have any relationship with is ridiculous. That would be a lack of character. She is wrong and she is paying with the end of her marriage that's enough. What she did didn't affected OP. The house has nothing to do with it. This guy has no claim to a house he didn't built and he didn't pay. He was not even a tenant he was living rent free.", "> his dear uncle continue hurting his father by saying \u2018 I basically give her the house\u2019 ,\u00b4I will not take back the house from my sister because she destroyed her marriage\n\nBIL isn't married to OP. OP shouldn't be giving him marital property or alimony. The marriage has nothing to do with OP. OP is letting his sister live in his house rent free. Who the heck is the BIL to demand someone who is not his spouse keep supporting him? To let him live in their house rent free? If the sister and BIL had their own house then they could have settled it in court. Who the heck demands their ex brother in law let's them leech off them for years and also cut off the sibling who helped them in the past? Who the heck is he to demand such shit from his ex brother in law?", "I never said the sister should be kicked out. I have no clue why that is being brought up. I said she should not be living there rent free. She lost nothing. Free house is still there, family still supports her, while the husband was completely screwed over and is now in jeopardy of losing his child because the op is so selfish and short sighted. The op is the AH if he does nothing but let everything go \"back to the way it was\" as he said. He has the opportunity to do the right thing by everyone, and he chooses not to. I don't respect him for that. That's all.", "It's his house. She is leaving there rent free because she helped him. That's all that matters. Thus guy was mooching off his wife because she had helped her brother and then he let her stay there That's truth. You are wrong but feel free to feel revengeful against cheaters but don't expect non affected parties to be raging against the  cheater like they are murderer."]}
