She said \"not until you give me a reason why\" \n\nI gathered my things and told her that if this bothered her so much problems to contact my dad and talk to him.

They deserve to be reported for trying to make you do something that is detrimental to your health even after you explained that it was medically inadvisable for you to give blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd honestly, even if you didn't have a condition and just weren't comfortable doing so, she still wouldn't have any damn business trying to pressure you into doing it if you said you didn't want to.", "NTA You were assertive but not rude. You removed yourself from the situation rather than lose your temper and escalate things. You don\u2019t say how much class time had elapsed before you left. However, after this exchange with the teacher, I would be surprised if you would be able to stay in class and concentrate on any teaching.\n\nYour teacher was extremely unprofessional and was pretty much harassing you. It is not their business why you choose not to give blood and they should not be asking for details.", "NTA.  But anyone, your mom included, that supports an ignorant teacher harassing a student in front of the class is a royal AH.\n\nIt's disturbing that this idiot is in any way an authority figure and a supposed example for students.  She lacks the capacity for logical thought.\n\nAnyone who doesn't understand that someone with anemia can't give blood should at least understand when a student's doctor says the student can't give blood.  \n\nThis teacher is a danger to her students.  What if she had succeeded in intimidating OP into giving blood and compromised her health. \n\nOP, I hope your dad demands the teacher be fired or you'll sue for attempted child endangerment and anything else a lawyer can find.", "No NTA\u2026and as an aside, I would be proud of you if you were my kid. You were assertive, tried to resolve the conflict, and yet, you didn\u2019t back down or get intimidated. \n\nAnd the teacher was completely out of line in all aspects.\n\nWELL DONE!", "NTA - you have a legit medical reason, but, even if you didn\u2019t - who cares? It\u2019s your blood, you get to decide what you want to do with it. For her to keep pushing and pressuring is pretty odd.", "EXCUSE ME?? You don't have to give her a reason, you already said you were anemic, which any imbecile should understand makes blood donation a no-no for you. If you had tried they would have told you no anyway. I would be going to my counselor/advisor and making a formal complaint about this.

And even if she doesn't understand anaemia, she should understand that your doctor has given you strict instructions not to give blood outside of a hospital.\n\nYou were right to walk out, and you were right to complain.\n\nShe was unprofessional, and if your 'friends' can't see that then you might want to re-evaluate your relationships with them.", "NTA giving blood can be dangerous. I passed out after giving blood and the nurses didn't catch me and I hit my head on the corner of a counter as I fell. Nasty concussion. I was pressured into giving blood even though I was tired and dehydrated and I wish I had declined. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nBlood drives are voluntary.  You don't have to justify anything to anyone if you choose not to donate, let alone for a legitimate medical reason.\n\nYour teacher was way out of line.", "Geez. There are all kinds of reasons why people can't donate blood. Anemia is the least of it. She was basically asking you to reveal your private medical information in front of your class.

Good job advocating for yourself.", "Bravo! You handled this situation with this bully as well as you could have. Why you didn't sign up for a blood drive is no-one's business but yours and she was way out of line to ask and then argue with you about it.

You did the right thing.", "NTA. and I\u2019d you where my kid I\u2019d be proud of the way that you handled this.", "NTA - no teacher should be pressing you for your private medical information, particularly in front of the class. A reason to not give blood may also involve sexual history - again none of your teacher's or class' business!\n\nEven the way the blood drive was done- I do NOT see that being approved here in terms of how they got people to sign up. My school had a blood drive and did not involve the classes whatsoever besides people being excused to miss class to donate.\n\nI rely on people giving blood as a regular blood product user and am very much not ok with what your teacher did.", "NTA even in the slightest, in fact the teacher overstepped the line by even asking why you didn't volunteer, they have no right to your medical information, particularly in front of an entire class of students. They have no right to even question it if the only reason was you didn't want to. You dealt with it extremely well in my opinion", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure donating blood is purely optional and no one should be pressured into it. She was very wrong for not dropping the topic, and it\u2019s not her business to insist you give a reasoning on your personal choice. You had a legit reason, and you weren\u2019t wrong in leaving.

Teacher totally overstepped and should be reported. NTA", "NTA. Your teacher's response was intrusive, and disrespectful, but there was nothing disrespectful about what you said. There's no reason you should have even found it necessary to tell her about your condition. A simple \"my doctor says I'm not to give blood for medical reasons\" should have been a  sufficient as to why you were incapable of giving blood. \n\nShe was completely out of line in acting like it wasn't, and giving you any grief about it whatsoever. What she should have done was say \"okay, no problem\" once presented with your answer of \"my doctor says I'm not allowed to give blood.\" That's where the questions should have ended. Or if there were any further questions, it should simply have been to ask for a note from the doctor, but nothing else.", "Here is a list of valid reasons not to donate blood:\n- you are anemic\n- you have a blood disorder\n- you have an std\n- you have another medical condition\n- you are afraid of needles\n- religious reasons\n- you just don\u2019t want to\n- and more\n\nYour teacher is not entitled to know  ANY OF THEM!!!  NTA and next time don\u2019t feel like you have to give a reason.  Just say that\u2019s private medical information.  If she keeps pushing, do exactly what you did and report.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, you don\u2019t need to justify why you don\u2019t want to do something. That teacher does not own your body. Don\u2019t want to give blood? That\u2019s your decision, and only your decision. \n\nAdditionally you have been told you are anemic by your doctor and to not give blood; that should have shut the conversation down right there. If the teacher doesn\u2019t understand that certain health conditions make it unwise to give blood they have no business interacting with children from a position of authority. You held your own and acted responsibly to protect yourself, your parents should be proud of you.", "NTA. She\u2019s a teacher and not your medical doctor.  Also, if you didn\u2019t want to donate blood, it\u2019s none of her business.  Also, she WAS being unprofessional about the whole thing.", "NTA and I cannot see how your teacher isn\u2019t reprimanded for this.", "NTA.

Former teacher here (retired): I think you reacted exactly right. And how your doctor's orders are not a valid reason, I fail to understand.", "This can't be real.", "NTA. Your not putting up your hand should have been the end of it. Her reaction to that was unprofessional and disrespectful and might even amount to bullying. Your medical condition is personal health information that your teacher had no right to ask about. Once you stated your condition, that should been another opportunity for her to STFU. I say well done to you for the way you handled it. I don\u2019t think I would have had that composure at your age. You might also consider a complaint to the teachers\u2019 licensing body in your jurisdiction.", "Just leaving class would have been bad. Going to the office to talk to admin was actually responsible.", "NTA. And I applaud you. Your poise in an uncomfortable situation was fabulous! You tried everything you could to resolve the conflict and when that didn\u2019t happen you removed yourself from the situation and reported to the appropriate next level. Very well done!", "NTA- Your reason could have been \"because I don't feel like it,\" and that should be good enough. Instead, she bullied you into disclosing medical information that is supposed to be private. \n\nYou really should file a complaint against her. She's not fit for the job.", "NTA\n\nYour response was needed. She was WAY out of line from the moment she questioned any of you, and you should not have had to justify your decision. Please continue with the complaint, and if you feel comfortable doing so, ask the others who declined and anyone else in the room who backed you up to lodge their own complaints as well.\n\nGlad your dad has your back.", "NTA whatsoever. It's extremely inappropriate for the teacher to try to force you for medical information.  And it is never their place to overrule what your doctor told you.\n\nYou gave your reason, even though you shouldn't have had to, the conversation should have been dropped.", "NTA. But I don\u2019t think this actually happened.", "NTA and my hero!  Good for you and I hope that asshole teacher got a good talking to by the principal.\n\nAlways stand up to power hungry control freaks when you know you\u2019re in the right.", "NTA. Your health and personal boundaries should always be respected, and your teacher's insistence on discussing your reasons for not donating blood, despite your clear explanation, was inappropriate.

You don\u2019t owe your teacher an explanation as to why you don\u2019t want to GIVE AWAY YOUR BLOOD. It\u2019s your blood.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nTeachers aren\u2019t qualified to decide who can give blood. And your medical conditions are none of her business to the extent she doesn\u2019t need to know needed accommodations. What if someone was ineligible because they have HIV, because they\u2019re anorexic, or some other reason that they don\u2019t want to announce to the class. She needs to mind her own.", "NTA. You did an excellent job of self advocating and standing up to this teacher who was WAY out of line. As a mother myself, I would be immensely proud if my children stand up for themselves like this when they get to be your age. Well done OP hold your head high and don\u2019t worry about what others think.", "NTA. This is the hill to die on", "NTA!!! Respect goes both ways and you aren\u2019t getting it. Perhaps you could\u2019ve said it in a nicer way but your teacher is out of line for forcing you to talk about your medical history in front of the class especially after you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.", "NTA; teacher is way out of line and not your doctor.  Blood donation is not compulsory, and you do not have to give any details about your medical circumstances to decline donating.  Your teacher is going to get in trouble if they keep this up\u2026", "NTA. What kinda friends take your teachers side for something like that?", "I'm not your parent but I AM a parent of an anemic 16 year old.  If you were my child I would be in a meeting so fast that teacher's head would spin.  It's great that she likes to give to others, but pressuring students to give blood is not ok and WILL wind up leading to the end of blood drives at school.  You should not be forced or coerced in to giving blood, even if you are able.\n\nAlso, if it's anything like when I used to give blood, they'd check to see if you're anemic.  And if you are, they won't let you anyway.  So basically this teacher is harassing you for nothing.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA. Good for you standing up for yourself. You were absolutely correct to report her.\n\nGood luck with your anemia, is sucks.", "NTA. She was out of line for asking you in the first place. Everything that came after was pure ridiculous.", "NTA. Teacher was surprisingly inappropriate.", "Your Dad is right. You don't have to shut up and take abuse from someone because they have authority over you. She pushed you to explain your medical history to the class? And then would not accept the answer? I don't think she's in the right career. Maybe she should get a pen and a board and stand outside busy malls trying to get people to sign up for charities or something. What a jerk.", "Holy crap. I used to donate blood often but developed a form of anemia that made it so I always fail the hemoglobin test, so I quit trying for years. Well, one day the mall was giving movie tickets for blood donations so I figured I'd give it a shot. They forgot to check my hemoglobin and I was like, haha suckers! Movie tickets for me!\n\nI ended up passing the fuk out and got stretchered out of Victoria's Secret by paramedics about 30 mins later. \n\nNTA OP. I have no idea what your teacher is smoking, but she needs to be reported for trying to cause you medical harm. Good on you for defending yourself.", "i\u2019m a high school teacher. this is WILDLY inappropriate of your teacher! if you were my student and hadn\u2019t already reported it yourself, i would\u2019ve reported it myself. you did the right thing.

Also did the teacher only target you or did she comment on the other two as well?", "NTA\nThis teacher is an incredible asshole! I\u2019m pretty sure giving blood is a choice.

While respect that giving blood is a civic duty that many people enjoy and/or do, having a medical condition that precludes you from giving does not necessarily indicate a desire to participate by rather a reason the blood bank cannot accept your attempt to donate.

You\u2019re NTA at all and I\u2019m proud of you for handling this with such maturity.", "100% NTA\nYour teacher was wrong on so many points.

I played it off 3 times because I was very uncomfortable about it, and he wouldn't let it go and gave me an ultimatum. I said the straight truth and he didn't believe that was what I was talking about. He apparently thought I was saying something about him across the yard. He then asked a bunch of other students about it and they were all like \"yeah, that's what happened.\" The teacher basically panicked because anyone who asked about this would basically describe what happened as a teacher pressuring students to talk about a pretty private event and then asking for more and more details.

As you grow, you can take more responsibility and agency to decide if and when someone in position of authority over you has or not the wisdom and knowledge to decide for yourself, and you (hopefully) grow the ability to stand up for yourself in appropriate ways in face of an overbearing authority figure when it's worth it. You did this in a remarkable way.\n\nI would recommend to let go on the expectation that your friend group will be able to agree with this, and accept that you are different.
