She said \"not until you give me a reason why\" \n\nI gathered my things and told her that if this bothered her so much problems to contact my dad and talk to him.

They deserve to be reported for trying to make you do something that is detrimental to your health even after you explained that it was medically inadvisable for you to give blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd honestly, even if you didn't have a condition and just weren't comfortable doing so, she still wouldn't have any damn business trying to pressure you into doing it if you said you didn't want to.", "NTA You were assertive but not rude. You removed yourself from the situation rather than lose your temper and escalate things. You don\u2019t say how much class time had elapsed before you left. However, after this exchange with the teacher, I would be surprised if you would be able to stay in class and concentrate on any teaching.\n\nYour teacher was extremely unprofessional and was pretty much harassing you. It is not their business why you choose not to give blood and they should not be asking for details.", "NTA.  But anyone, your mom included, that supports an ignorant teacher harassing a student in front of the class is a royal AH.\n\nIt's disturbing that this idiot is in any way an authority figure and a supposed example for students.  She lacks the capacity for logical thought.\n\nAnyone who doesn't understand that someone with anemia can't give blood should at least understand when a student's doctor says the student can't give blood.  \n\nThis teacher is a danger to her students.  What if she had succeeded in intimidating OP into giving blood and compromised her health. \n\nOP, I hope your dad demands the teacher be fired or you'll sue for attempted child endangerment and anything else a lawyer can find.", "No NTA\u2026and as an aside, I would be proud of you if you were my kid. You were assertive, tried to resolve the conflict, and yet, you didn\u2019t back down or get intimidated. \n\nAnd the teacher was completely out of line in all aspects.\n\nWELL DONE!", "NTA - you have a legit medical reason, but, even if you didn\u2019t - who cares? It\u2019s your blood, you get to decide what you want to do with it. For her to keep pushing and pressuring is pretty odd.", "EXCUSE ME?? You don't have to give her a reason, you already said you were anemic, which any imbecile should understand makes blood donation a no-no for you. If you had tried they would have told you no anyway. I would be going to my counselor/advisor and making a formal complaint about this.

And even if she doesn't understand anaemia, she should understand that your doctor has given you strict instructions not to give blood outside of a hospital.\n\nYou were right to walk out, and you were right to complain.\n\nShe was unprofessional, and if your 'friends' can't see that then you might want to re-evaluate your relationships with them.", "NTA giving blood can be dangerous. I passed out after giving blood and the nurses didn't catch me and I hit my head on the corner of a counter as I fell. Nasty concussion. I was pressured into giving blood even though I was tired and dehydrated and I wish I had declined. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nBlood drives are voluntary.  You don't have to justify anything to anyone if you choose not to donate, let alone for a legitimate medical reason.\n\nYour teacher was way out of line.", "Geez. There are all kinds of reasons why people can't donate blood. Anemia is the least of it. She was basically asking you to reveal your private medical information in front of your class.

Good job advocating for yourself.", "Bravo! You handled this situation with this bully as well as you could have. Why you didn't sign up for a blood drive is no-one's business but yours and she was way out of line to ask and then argue with you about it.

That teacher should be fired.", "NTA and I'm fully on your side.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. and I\u2019d you where my kid I\u2019d be proud of the way that you handled this.", "NTA - no teacher should be pressing you for your private medical information, particularly in front of the class. A reason to not give blood may also involve sexual history - again none of your teacher's or class' business!\n\nEven the way the blood drive was done- I do NOT see that being approved here in terms of how they got people to sign up. My school had a blood drive and did not involve the classes whatsoever besides people being excused to miss class to donate.\n\nI rely on people giving blood as a regular blood product user and am very much not ok with what your teacher did.", "NTA even in the slightest, in fact the teacher overstepped the line by even asking why you didn't volunteer, they have no right to your medical information, particularly in front of an entire class of students. They have no right to even question it if the only reason was you didn't want to. You dealt with it extremely well in my opinion", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure donating blood is purely optional and no one should be pressured into it. She was very wrong for not dropping the topic, and it\u2019s not her business to insist you give a reasoning on your personal choice. You had a legit reason, and you weren\u2019t wrong in leaving.

Teacher totally overstepped and should be reported. NTA", "NTA. Your teacher's response was intrusive, and disrespectful, but there was nothing disrespectful about what you said. There's no reason you should have even found it necessary to tell her about your condition. A simple \"my doctor says I'm not to give blood for medical reasons\" should have been a  sufficient as to why you were incapable of giving blood. \n\nShe was completely out of line in acting like it wasn't, and giving you any grief about it whatsoever. What she should have done was say \"okay, no problem\" once presented with your answer of \"my doctor says I'm not allowed to give blood.\" That's where the questions should have ended. Or if there were any further questions, it should simply have been to ask for a note from the doctor, but nothing else.", "Here is a list of valid reasons not to donate blood:\n- you are anemic\n- you have a blood disorder\n- you have an std\n- you have another medical condition\n- you are afraid of needles\n- religious reasons\n- you just don\u2019t want to\n- and more\n\nYour teacher is not entitled to know  ANY OF THEM!!!  NTA and next time don\u2019t feel like you have to give a reason.  Just say that\u2019s private medical information.  If she keeps pushing, do exactly what you did and report.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, you don\u2019t need to justify why you don\u2019t want to do something. That teacher does not own your body. Don\u2019t want to give blood? That\u2019s your decision, and only your decision. \n\nAdditionally you have been told you are anemic by your doctor and to not give blood; that should have shut the conversation down right there. If the teacher doesn\u2019t understand that certain health conditions make it unwise to give blood they have no business interacting with children from a position of authority. You held your own and acted responsibly to protect yourself, your parents should be proud of you.", "NTA. She\u2019s a teacher and not your medical doctor.  Also, if you didn\u2019t want to donate blood, it\u2019s none of her business.  Also, she WAS being unprofessional about the whole thing.", "NTA and I cannot see how your teacher isn\u2019t reprimanded for this.", "NTA.

Former teacher here (retired): I think you reacted exactly right. And how your doctor's orders are not a valid reason, I fail to understand.", "This can't be real.", "NTA. Your not putting up your hand should have been the end of it. Her reaction to that was unprofessional and disrespectful and might even amount to bullying. Your medical condition is personal health information that your teacher had no right to ask about. Once you stated your condition, that should been another opportunity for her to STFU. I say well done to you for the way you handled it. I don\u2019t think I would have had that composure at your age. You might also consider a complaint to the teachers\u2019 licensing body in your jurisdiction.", "Just leaving class would have been bad. Going to the office to talk to admin was actually responsible.", "NTA. And I applaud you. Your poise in an uncomfortable situation was fabulous! You tried everything you could to resolve the conflict and when that didn\u2019t happen you removed yourself from the situation and reported to the appropriate next level. Very well done!", "NTA- Your reason could have been \"because I don't feel like it,\" and that should be good enough. Instead, she bullied you into disclosing medical information that is supposed to be private. \n\nYou really should file a complaint against her. She's not fit for the job.", "NTA\n\nYour response was needed. She was WAY out of line from the moment she questioned any of you, and you should not have had to justify your decision. Please continue with the complaint, and if you feel comfortable doing so, ask the others who declined and anyone else in the room who backed you up to lodge their own complaints as well.\n\nGlad your dad has your back.", "NTA whatsoever. It's extremely inappropriate for the teacher to try to force you for medical information.  And it is never their place to overrule what your doctor told you.\n\nYou gave your reason, even though you shouldn't have had to, the conversation should have been dropped.", "NTA. But I don\u2019t think this actually happened.", "NTA and my hero!  Good for you and I hope that asshole teacher got a good talking to by the principal.\n\nAlways stand up to power hungry control freaks when you know you\u2019re in the right.", "NTA. Your health and personal boundaries should always be respected, and your teacher's insistence on discussing your reasons for not donating blood, despite your clear explanation, was inappropriate.

You don\u2019t owe your teacher an explanation as to why you don\u2019t want to GIVE AWAY YOUR BLOOD. It\u2019s your blood.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nTeachers aren\u2019t qualified to decide who can give blood. And your medical conditions are none of her business to the extent she doesn\u2019t need to know needed accommodations. What if someone was ineligible because they have HIV, because they\u2019re anorexic, or some other reason that they don\u2019t want to announce to the class. She needs to mind her own.", "NTA. You did an excellent job of self advocating and standing up to this teacher who was WAY out of line. As a mother myself, I would be immensely proud if my children stand up for themselves like this when they get to be your age. Well done OP hold your head high and don\u2019t worry about what others think.", "NTA. This is the hill to die on", "NTA!!! Respect goes both ways and you aren\u2019t getting it. Perhaps you could\u2019ve said it in a nicer way but your teacher is out of line for forcing you to talk about your medical history in front of the class especially after you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.", "NTA; teacher is way out of line and not your doctor.  Blood donation is not compulsory, and you do not have to give any details about your medical circumstances to decline donating.  Your teacher is going to get in trouble if they keep this up\u2026", "NTA. What kinda friends take your teachers side for something like that?", "I'm not your parent but I AM a parent of an anemic 16 year old.  If you were my child I would be in a meeting so fast that teacher's head would spin.  It's great that she likes to give to others, but pressuring students to give blood is not ok and WILL wind up leading to the end of blood drives at school.  You should not be forced or coerced in to giving blood, even if you are able.\n\nAlso, if it's anything like when I used to give blood, they'd check to see if you're anemic.  And if you are, they won't let you anyway.  So basically this teacher is harassing you for nothing.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA. Good for you standing up for yourself. You were absolutely correct to report her.\n\nGood luck with your anemia, is sucks.", "NTA. She was out of line for asking you in the first place. Everything that came after was pure ridiculous.", "NTA. Teacher was surprisingly inappropriate.", "Your Dad is right. You don't have to shut up and take abuse from someone because they have authority over you. She pushed you to explain your medical history to the class? And then would not accept the answer? I don't think she's in the right career. Maybe she should get a pen and a board and stand outside busy malls trying to get people to sign up for charities or something. What a jerk.", "Holy crap. I used to donate blood often but developed a form of anemia that made it so I always fail the hemoglobin test, so I quit trying for years. Well, one day the mall was giving movie tickets for blood donations so I figured I'd give it a shot. They forgot to check my hemoglobin and I was like, haha suckers! Movie tickets for me!\n\nI ended up passing the fuk out and got stretchered out of Victoria's Secret by paramedics about 30 mins later. \n\nNTA OP. I have no idea what your teacher is smoking, but she needs to be reported for trying to cause you medical harm. Good on you for defending yourself.", "i\u2019m a high school teacher. this is WILDLY inappropriate of your teacher! if you were my student and hadn\u2019t already reported it yourself, i would\u2019ve reported it myself. you did the right thing.

Also did the teacher only target you or did she comment on the other two as well?", "NTA\nThis teacher is an incredible asshole! I\u2019m pretty sure giving blood is a choice.

While respect that giving blood is a civic duty that many people enjoy and/or do, having a medical condition that precludes you from giving does not necessarily indicate a desire to participate by rather a reason the blood bank cannot accept your attempt to donate.

You\u2019re NTA at all and I\u2019m proud of you for handling this with such maturity.", "100% NTA\nYour teacher was wrong on so many points.

I played it off 3 times because I was very uncomfortable about it, and he wouldn't let it go and gave me an ultimatum. I said the straight truth and he didn't believe that was what I was talking about. He apparently thought I was saying something about him across the yard. He then asked a bunch of other students about it and they were all like \"yeah, that's what happened.\" The teacher basically panicked because anyone who asked about this would basically describe what happened as a teacher pressuring students to talk about a pretty private event and then asking for more and more details.

As you grow, you can take more responsibility and agency to decide if and when someone in position of authority over you has or not the wisdom and knowledge to decide for yourself, and you (hopefully) grow the ability to stand up for yourself in appropriate ways in face of an overbearing authority figure when it's worth it. You did this in a remarkable way.\n\nI would recommend to let go on the expectation that your friend group will be able to agree with this, and accept that you are different.

And it would have been worth it to me to see them politely, but firmly, tell her off.\n\nNow that I am no longer anemic I donate as often as I can, but even now I sometimes fall below the donation threshold, 12.5, and have to come back and try again.\n\nThey literally will not let you donate, and your teacher needs a lesson about this.\n\nETA, judgement. NTA", "My blood floats.", "My dad was a universal doner and from the age of 18 he donated regularly. Well in the 80's he married my step-mom and she thought the whole thing was ridiculous. She regularly called the blood bank, The Vampires. She ragged on him for donating but he always said \"You never know, maybe I saved a life today\" and dropped it. \n\nHe died as a result of a motorcycle accident in 2000. We ended up donating his organs. The whole processes was so eye opening, including the recipient letters she received, that she started donating blood. 20+ years later and she is still donating.", "I about puke and pass out giving 2 vials. Couldn't imagine giving donation amount. I think I'd just die at that point", "HIPAA doesn't have anything to do with teachers or anyone else asking about your medical information. It just prohibits healthcare providers from giving it out without your consent.", "Not HIPAA, but definitely FERPA", "Its illegal to ask? Interesting, I always thought it was only illegal to make disclosure ***mandatory***. Didn't realize they just straight up weren't even allowed to ask if you would be willing to disclose it. In that case the teacher is even worse then I thought they were and the school needs to take even stricter action to crack down on her.", "Hippa  edit", "you handled this like a pro.  You stood up for yourself, you were assertive, and you left before doing or saying something you would regret.  I would be proud of you if you were my daughter, that's why your Dad is proud of you too.  very well done. \n\n And your teacher is a total ass. I have anemia, you could have fainted if you gave blood.", "Girl, I'm 38 and hope one day to be like you! You did the right thing, and that teacher was incredibly disrespectful.", "something I have found pretty consistently in life is that it is very easy to fail to stand up for oneself in situations like these, go with the flow, and kick yourself later for not demanding the respect you deserved from others. you deserve a pat on the back for not letting yourself regret this incident. your teacher had no right to speak to you this way, and I can name moments in my life from like ten years ago when I wish I had summoned the same poise you did. personally I\u2019d be thrilled to hear that you and your father made this woman\u2019s professional life hell for this\u2014no student should be made to feel this way\u2014but either way, I really think you\u2019ve done right by your future self here.", "10 min or the whole class I'd still call NTA. I'd like to think my daughter would do the same and I'd back her up. As soon as you said your doctor told you not to do it, that should have been the end of it. Well, it wasn't her place to digging into that to begin with, but I think you know what I mean.", "The stuff at the blood run would disqualify you once you explained the situation anyway. \n\nThat being said, NTA. It's a good thing that you have the strength to stand up for yourself and not allow a figure of power to bully you into something. \n\nPeople always made a big deal out of blood run in my school/college, too. I had very low blood pressure and was always disqualified on the spot. She needs to understand she is not a medical professional and, at the end of the day, these are personal data, and she shouldn't ask such questions in front of others, not even the class. It seems that teachers overstepping is an international phenomenon.", "Ha, what I'd have done if I was OP, would be literally walking the teacher down to the blood drive, get one of the admins' attention, and, while the teacher is standing there like a smug idiot, ask the admin to explain to the teacher why an anemic student should never be forced to give blood, and shame on teacher for pressuring OP to sacrifice her health like that.", "Seconding this. I can't donate blood because I get periods from hell. I've tried four times, I wasn't allowed to donate at all the first two times- they checked my stuff and went hell no. The second two times went fine- until I got a period from hell and had to go to the ER for blood.", "It all depends on the situation, but it\u2019s possible this is a violation of FERPA laws. FERPA is confusing (I have to do trainings every few years) because some things depend on whether it\u2019s an official school record or not. And medical things are weird because if the student self discloses a condition you don\u2019t have to keep it quiet. And this situation is sort of a gray area.", "It\u2019s bizarre to berate a student to comply and demand an explanation of a medical condition and then not accept the reason.  NTA this teacher is unprofessional.", "We hope they would, but we can't guarantee it.  There are idiots everywhere, and failures can cascade. I've seen some amazing multiple level failures by the medical community, especially when they are dealing with women, children, or the elderly.  \n\nAll three categories are regularly dismissed, and their voices are often ignored. OP, thankfully, seems to have a voice and refuses to be ignored. Maybe she can teach her mother.", "Could only hope. People die at the hands of medical professionals *all the time*.", "I'm normally pretty cynical about posts on here, but this one I can actually see happening. And that's only because I've seen plenty of videos, here on Public Freakouts and on YouTube, of teachers acting just this bad and getting rightfully called out by students.", "Quick glance at their profile shows they're always posting AITA stories on here to the point the mods renoved one of their last ones for posting too much. Has got to be made up.  It's too exaggerated.", "LOL, ugh\u2026 you\u2019re probably right. I fall for them every time.", "Can you even imagine if the answer was something more controversial, like OP *couldn't* donate because she had HIV or something else that can be transmitted through her blood?  I imagine even asking her why could potentially be a fireable offense for that reason.", "Gotta hope this teacher isn't teaching biology.", "That\u2019s so weird. I know that many people are afraid of it, but I don\u2019t understand people who actively campaign against it, unless your stepmom is of whichever religion prohibits it. Even then those people usually just say, don\u2019t make me, but they don\u2019t tell others not to.\n\nIn any event, I\u2019m glad she was \u201cconverted,\u201d and that your dad didn\u2019t let her convince him not to. I used to donate a lot before I had kidney failure, and now I have trouble keeping my hemoglobin levels above 10. I even had my first transfusion a few months ago and was sure appreciative of whoever donated that unit.", "I\u2019m universal donor too and give regularly. I call them vampires too.", "It\u2019s not illegal to ask unless you know you\u2019re asking for medical history. The fact the teacher asked in front of the class makes it seem like she was trying to pressure these 3 students in to giving blood when they chose not to. It\u2019s none of the teacher\u2019s business why OP declined.", "Good for you at standing up for yourself and not allowing her to intimidate you. You did this with an assertive and polite manner. I hope your father follows up with a complaint to the school.", "Hell, she's not my daughter and I AM proud of op. Seems like she's the most adult person in the group, no means no and that's it, full stop!\n\nYou did all the right things op, screw anyone who says otherwise.", "We had a blood drive when I was in high school and in assembly the principal thanked everyone who donated and then asked the students who wanted to donate but couldn\u2019t to stand up. Four girls stood and I heard a boy say to his friend, \u201cI told you it would be girls.\u201d", "When a problem escalates to the point of causing a death it is almost with 100% certainty just the last link in a chain of bad decisions.\n\n\nLet's take a somewhat common example everyone has probably heard of. An amusement park ride kills someone.\n\n1. Could the Ride Operator have prevented the problem entirely or acted to stop the problem before anyone got hurt? Do Ride Operators have sufficient training? Are we hiring qualified people?\n\n2. Was proper maintenance performed? Are our maintenance people well trained? Are they given the tools, time, and manpower to do their jobs successfully? Are proper inspections performed at all necessary intervals?  Do the maintenance logs indicate problems?\n\n3. Is there a problem with the way the ride was constructed? Were plans followed properly? Were corners cut? Was it properly inspected before opening day?\n\n4. Was the ride's engineering sound? Were the engineers available to answer questions during construction? Were the proper checks, tests, etc. performed and logged?\n\n5. Was the original design work solid? Were there problems? Were they identified and corrected by Engineering?\n\n\nA failure sufficient to kill someone is probably going to be a failure at several points on this list. Perhaps the original design work didn't take into account some geographical feature that produced stresses that... Engineering didn't account for. Construction cut a few corners to save time and reduced the extra engineering that was designed into it to eliminate or reduce unanticipated problems. Maintenance has noticed extra wear and tear but because no one wants to pay for maintenance components have been left in place longer than they should have. And the Ride Operator is a high school kid that watched a one hour video on being a park employee and three fifteen minute videos on three of the five machines he is expected to run depending on where he is assigned on any given day.", "So OP deleted her prior posts, but thanks to judgment bot I could still read them. \n\nAll of the posts I saw say that OP is teenage girl in high school, and one that got deleted was because it didn't belong here.\n\nSo I think OP probably posts here more than she should, but I don't actually think she's lying. This would also be far from the first teacher to do something like this. There's a massive teacher shortage in the US so schools don't have the ability to be selective.\n\nBesides, we've had thousands and thousands of people die because of the amount of people who don't believe in the covid vaccine, so americans being medically ignorant as fuck is hardly new.", "She's a teenage girl. As a former teenage girl: We're all drama queens until we get the life experience to match the hormones.", "Coming from a family with 3 generations of teachers, unfortunately it isn't exaggerated.", "I usually do too but I tend to take the teenager vs teacher stories with a grain of salt.", "Yup, this is yet another reason why the teacher was astronomically out of line. \n\nImagine if OP was badgered into admitting something that students then ostracized her and bullied her for?!\n\nThe teacher was flat out harassing OP about her medical condition, and she needs to be dealt with through the school.", "Snap. Was thinking the same.", "Gotta hope that this teacher won't be teaching much longer.", "Honestly, I think it was more that she personally didn't see the point and thought is was useless. 30+ years of hindsight says she was fairly selfish at that time. Losing my dad really messed her up and forced her to grow up.", "as you should, a lot of them are made up. I can't tell you to believe what my post has said and I respect that you don't trust it. Not trusting things on the internet easily is a very good quality to have, i wouldn't even believe my post if i wasn't the one who wrote it."]}
