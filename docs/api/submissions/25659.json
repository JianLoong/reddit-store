We live in a world, we\u2019re people are looking for excuse to be jerks to a homosexual couple. They are looking for reason on why you shouldn\u2019t raise a child.  I see this frequently.

Due to fact that became a parent to two year old and you lost your sister.  But you need to get it together. You may have be the guardian to your niece now, but if your behavior continues, it can help lose your guardianship. It takes one person say, his temper is out of control.

You are arguing in comments when people are giving helpful suggestions.", "Gently, YTA.\n\n>Is it really so unreasonable that I don\u2019t want him to gossip about our private life with every random stranger?\n\nNope, that's not an unreasonable expectation at all. In fact, it's very understandable. I'm a pretty private person, but I wasn't always. As an autistic person I struggled to learn boundaries, and having been raised by DEEPLY private parents I often frustrated them (as your partner is you) by oversharing, until I learned more about appropriate sharing. But that's not even really the issue here.\n\nThe issue is that while you see the neighbour as an annoying busybody, your partner sees her as . . . a friend. So this isn't about him \"gossip\\[ing\\] ... with every random stranger\". It's about him sharing about what is also HIS life over a coffee with a friend, which is a very normal thing to do. And he does get to do that. And you don't have to love it, but you do have to respect that he gets to choose his friends, and you're not always going to love who he chooses. Welcome to the fun of marriage/long-term partnership.\n\nWhat you CAN do, rather than getting angry (which won't help at all and will just lead to the resentment you've just experienced), is express to him privately, and with love, that you feel uncomfortable with that particular neighbour, and that while you respect his right to have any friendships that make him feel safe and supported, that you hope he will also respect your discomfort in this situation and not overshare about you personally in a way that makes you vulnerable to someone with whom you are not as close as he is. That's completely fair. He can be friends and gossip with her, but he doesn't need to share YOUR privacy with her.", "I can understand being upset If you feel your partner is talking smack about you but you can't demand that he not talk to her. That's controlling. I wonder if she wanted to check on him cause she figured out that you're controlling \n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nHe knows you don't like this woman, yet somehow thinks inviting her in and discussing your problems is appropriate. Your majorly grieving, dealing with a grieving child you now have custody of. He could be a little sympathetic to the situation. Instead he's acting like a child and ignoring you.", "First off sorry for your loss no you're not the asshole the neighbor is I would sit down with your man and explain things the best way possible the neighbor just wants to gossip with her friends about you", "Be really careful with nosey, all up in your business neighbors.\n\nWhen she hears loud noises coming from your home, she will call 911 or CPS.   \nThe only reason she heard anything, was because her windows were wide open and she was sitting there listening for anything and everything.\n\nI know your partner wants to make friends in the new neighborhood, but nosey bitches like that, can do a lot of damage; to your relationship with your partner and make life hard if CPS is called in to check on your niece.\n\nGood Luck.", "NTA.  Most here seem to think you're being paranoid.  But your description of here fits the definition of the neighborhood busy body.  And you're the new gay couple with a child.  You have every right to gatekeep your own life. By disrespecting your boundaries, your partner is denying you the control of your own story.\n\nAsk your partner how he feels knowing that everything that he has ever shared with the neighbor has been shared with the entire beighborhoid and everyone else she engages with in person and on social media.  Remind him that the information he shared is just the raw material for the story she's telling. And with each telling, it moves father from the truth. \n\nYou're a gay male couple caring for a young girl.  While it really sucks, now is not a safe time for you.

You don't actually believe this complete idiocy you just wrote, right?\n\nWe're giving you an out here. Prove that you're not the posterchild for controlling toxicity in relationships and off you pop.", "The right choice would be leaving someone this controlling.", "Is the right choise hopefully ditching you? And even better if he did it and get together with your neighbor.", "He wasn't hiding the fact he was communicating with the neighbor.", "Wait wait wait wait wait, can we play devils advocate?\nHe wishes to speak to her, so you denying him this, would mean you\u2019re not respecting his wishes.\nSooooooo either you both respect the others wishes, which is a little problematic or you compromise and that would mean to stfu and f urself.", "You didnt put in your post that you told your partner not to talk her or allow her in your house.", "If my Husband disliked someone then I wouldn't invite them into the house. Why? Because that's our space, our safe space. If he didn't want a specific person here then I would never invite them in. Especially not whilst he was in bed asleep, and have him walk downstairs unaware. \n\nHis partner should apologise based off the original post, but like most things there are 3 sides to every story.", "How would he want to see it off he doesn't know it exists?\n\nYou should be apologizing for trying to prevent your so-called partner from speaking with whomever he chooses.", "No, he was shoving it into his face despite knowing OP feels uncomfortable with that neighbor, all just to hide what they were talking about anyway, might as well go talk at the local strip club at this point. He has no right to share anything about OP\u2019s private life with her, you\u2019re either a busybody neighbor or you haven\u2019t had to deal with one.", "OP doesn't want his partner to EVER talk to the neighbor. Even outside of the house. Again, read the comments. He's a controlling, abusive AH.", "I told him about it but he didn't want to see it right now, so maybe later. \n\nLike I said, I have nothing to apologize for. I was just being honest about how I feel about our neighbor", "Nope, I'm not and yup, I have. I simply don't participate. And OP doesn't have to either. \n\nOps partner is allowed to talk to other people. If OP doesn't want the neighbor in their shared home, then the conversations will just happen outside the home.", "I mean you told the story. He seemed upset at you asking to kick her out. And then was upset at not being nice to the neighbors. It sure seems like he didn\u2019t want to throw her out.", "You tried to control who your so-called partner is allowed to interact with."]}
