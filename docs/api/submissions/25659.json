It wasn\u2019t about anything big and we already made up again.\n\nThis morning when I woke up there were voices coming from the kitchen. When I entered it was my partner and our neighbor having coffee. I didn\u2019t catch everything they were saying but they stopped talking when I came in. I asked what they were doing and she answered that she just wanted to come by and see if everything was alright. When I asked her why she said she heard some loud noises again last night and just wanted to check on us. She looked at me accusingly when she said that.\n\nI tried to stay polite but I had literally just woken up and this was already pissing me off. I told her to get out of our house and to stop bothering us. She did but after she left my partner started bitching about me being rude to our neighbors. I told him I didn\u2019t want him to talk to her again because she was nosy and our life was none of her business.\n\nHe\u2019s being very childish about it and has basically given me the cold shoulder since then.

By your partner talking to her it should remove many questions she has. Shortly she may seem less nosy, but if she starts gossiping about you two cut her off.", "YTA and the one being childish.

But YTA. Some people peep on their neighbors, so what? We all do it. What has this woman actually done to make you upset beside trying to be friendly? These are your neighbors now, for who knows how long. Your partner is allowed to make friends. I am so sorry for your loss of your sister and BIL. I can't imagine how that hurts, but you can't take it out on the people around you. They care about you and probably just want to help. Best wishes, OP. See if you can talk to a therapist if you can while you're grieving.", "YTA and the one being childish. Your partner can talk to whomever they please.", "YTA. The next time she hears you arguing in her home. She\u2019s just going call cops. Let me tell you something, having cops involved and you just got custody of your niece is going to be pain in the ass.\n\nYou just made a bigger problem. We live in a world, we\u2019re people are looking for excuse to be jerks to a homosexual couple. They are looking for reason on why you shouldn\u2019t raise a child.  I see this frequently. Take beat, your partner has right to speak to the woman. \n\nHonestly, get some therapy. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve always been this controlling or is it new. Due to fact that became a parent to two year old and you lost your sister.  But you need to get it together. You may have be the guardian to your niece now, but if your behavior continues, it can help lose your guardianship. It takes one person say, his temper is out of control. I don\u2019t know you, but your response scream that you are angry. You are arguing in comments when people are giving helpful suggestions.", "Gently, YTA.\n\n>Is it really so unreasonable that I don\u2019t want him to gossip about our private life with every random stranger?\n\nNope, that's not an unreasonable expectation at all. In fact, it's very understandable. I'm a pretty private person, but I wasn't always. As an autistic person I struggled to learn boundaries, and having been raised by DEEPLY private parents I often frustrated them (as your partner is you) by oversharing, until I learned more about appropriate sharing. But that's not even really the issue here.\n\nThe issue is that while you see the neighbour as an annoying busybody, your partner sees her as . . . a friend. So this isn't about him \"gossip\\[ing\\] ... with every random stranger\". It's about him sharing about what is also HIS life over a coffee with a friend, which is a very normal thing to do. And he does get to do that. And you don't have to love it, but you do have to respect that he gets to choose his friends, and you're not always going to love who he chooses. Welcome to the fun of marriage/long-term partnership.\n\nWhat you CAN do, rather than getting angry (which won't help at all and will just lead to the resentment you've just experienced), is express to him privately, and with love, that you feel uncomfortable with that particular neighbour, and that while you respect his right to have any friendships that make him feel safe and supported, that you hope he will also respect your discomfort in this situation and not overshare about you personally in a way that makes you vulnerable to someone with whom you are not as close as he is. That's completely fair. He can be friends and gossip with her, but he doesn't need to share YOUR privacy with her.", "I can understand being upset If you feel your partner is talking smack about you but you can't demand that he not talk to her. That's controlling. I wonder if she wanted to check on him cause she figured out that you're controlling \n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nHe knows you don't like this woman, yet somehow thinks inviting her in and discussing your problems is appropriate. Your majorly grieving, dealing with a grieving child you now have custody of. He could be a little sympathetic to the situation. Instead he's acting like a child and ignoring you.", "First off sorry for your loss no you're not the asshole the neighbor is I would sit down with your man and explain things the best way possible the neighbor just wants to gossip with her friends about you", "Be really careful with nosey, all up in your business neighbors.\n\nWhen she hears loud noises coming from your home, she will call 911 or CPS.   \nThe only reason she heard anything, was because her windows were wide open and she was sitting there listening for anything and everything.\n\nI know your partner wants to make friends in the new neighborhood, but nosey bitches like that, can do a lot of damage; to your relationship with your partner and make life hard if CPS is called in to check on your niece.\n\nGood Luck.", "NTA.  Most here seem to think you're being paranoid.  But your description of here fits the definition of the neighborhood busy body.  And you're the new gay couple with a child.  You have every right to gatekeep your own life. By disrespecting your boundaries, your partner is denying you the control of your own story.\n\nAsk your partner how he feels knowing that everything that he has ever shared with the neighbor has been shared with the entire beighborhoid and everyone else she engages with in person and on social media.  Remind him that the information he shared is just the raw material for the story she's telling. And with each telling, it moves father from the truth. \n\nYou're a gay male couple caring for a young girl.  While it really sucks, now is not a safe time for you.

You may have overreacted but grieving people get a pass in my book. \n\nHave you had time to grieve properly and talked to anyone (friends, family, therapist)? Have you been able to talk to your partner? \n\nTo me it sounds to be like you are running low on mental/ emotional energy to talk to a new person. Which is okay.

Some people won\u2019t like gay people , or straight people or people who smoke weed , or loud children , or your choice in job or lifestyle. The best is to keep to yourself and be there to help your neighbour if they need it . That\u2019s it . I don\u2019t want to have to carry on a 15 min convo every time I leave home or come home.
