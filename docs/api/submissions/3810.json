His family sounds...odd. It makes sense to honor your friend and his art by wearing something he crafted especially for you", "NTA - Your friend made you the suit FOR your wedding, not himself. I cannot imagine a better way to celebrate and honor his skill and friendship than to wear it to your wedding. I think returning the suit is a fair compromise after the wedding. The family is obviously dealing with a tragic loss, but he made it for you. I'd be hard pressed to think he didn't make himself a suit along the way that he would rather be buried in anyway.", "YWNBTA\n\nWhy would they want him buried in a suit that he made to fit someone else? Doesn't he have a suit he made for himself? This is so odd. It's your suit. Keep it and wear it in his honor-- you're showing off his talent one last time.", "NTA  \nit is NOT disrespectful for you to wear it. It is an HONOR for you and him as well. They are being selfish which is maybe understandable in their grief, but still, not right.  \nYou wear it and you keep it afterward if you want to. He was your best friend. This is just my opinion because who am I to know this but, he would want you to have it forever.", "NTA - It's your suit and you paid for it. Let them be angry. You made a heartwarming gesture by even allowing them to have it when you're done.  I'm so sorry for your loss. Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "Hold the phone!!! You bought the suit and his fam just want you to give it to them???? You honour your friend by wearing his creation for your wedding. NTA", "NTA \n\nIt's your suit. It was in very bad taste for them to even ask. \n\nYou are honoring your friend by wearing it for you wedding. He made it just for you and you paid for it. \n\nDon't give it to them afterwards. They are disrespecting this man and his legacy. Shame on them.", "NTA. His family is bonkers to even suggest it. Wear the suit to your wedding.", "NTA, the suit-maker's family is way out of line here. That's your suit. It may be the last one he made, but *it's your suit.* Do not cave into their emotional blackmail, do not let it ruin your wedding and respectfully tell them they are ruining his memory by acting this way. If he was a tailor, he likely has some very choice suits he made for himself. Best of Luck.", "NTA. It\u2019s yours.", "NTA.  Wear your suit. If they want it back at that point, have it professionally cleaned for them and give it back with a nice note. \n\nIf they don't want it back, offer it to your future son or son-in-law for their weddings.", "NTA- HE MADE IT FOR YOU! HE WOULD WANT WANT YOU TO WEAR IT! \n\nHis parents are grieveing and want to hold on to anything tangeable that reminds them of their son. If he was asuit maker, wouldn't he have more suits???

It's also an important part of your wedding.", "NTA: Please keep the suit and wear with and joy for your . congratulations on your upcoming wedding.", "NTA.  Your best friend would probably be appalled.  He made that suit specifically for your to wear at your wedding.  It was made for YOU.

You wrote \u201cto be buried with him.\u201d  Not they wanted him to be buried in it?  Just want to place in his coffin? Am I reading wrong?\n\nEither way, your friend made a suit for you knowing you were getting married.  How thrilled he\nMust have been! You and he agreed on a price.  You bought it.\n\nThey now want THAT particular suit?  No.  They are grieving and to place it in a coffin and hide forever his talent is ridiculous.  Their grief is skewing their reasoning.  Explain you understand but want to honor him and have him with you on your special day so everyone will forever remember him and his talents.  They can choose to be mad or choose to be honored.", "Oof. NTA because he made the suit for you AND you offered to return it after the wedding. Grief can really screw with family members' minds, so don't be too harsh on them, I suppose, but he DID make it for you.

He provided the service.\n\nWear the suit then give it to the family.\n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYour friend made this suit for you, not to be buried in it.

The suit is a  work of art created by your friend for your special occasion. There was love in each stitch do wear the suit and know he's with you.\n\nPS grief does weird things to people and they're angry because it's easier to be angry at you than at him for dying.

What better way to pay homage to a dear friend. And offering them the suit after, is very gracious, but I don't seem to see why they need THIS suit as a memory or to bury him in...its very odd.", "NTA, it is YOUR suit, and giving it to them after the wedding is more than you are obligated to do.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, I am sorry about your friend.  That is awful and it can't be easy for you to lose a best friend, especially right before your wedding.\n\nHis family is also grieving, so they may be lashing out at you for seeing things differently than them.  Cut them some slack, too.\n\nI think it is a great honor that you are wearing this suit to your wedding. It's like he can't be there, but a part of him will be. And honestly, you'll look better in it than it'll look in an enclosed box.\n\nI think you did the best thing possible by offering to return the suit after the wedding. Aren't there any other suits that they can use? I would presume there are a lot of them if he's a suit maker, where you might only have this one fantastic suit!", "NTA\n\nIt's not their suit. \n\nAnd I'm guessing their son would not appreciate them disrespecting his work and relationship with you by trying to steal or guilt it from you.\n\nIt's very generous for you to offer to hand it over afterwards but wouldn't it honor his life more to keep it, wear it joyously, and continue to give life to his talents.", "NTA\n\nThis demand is bizarre, are you sure there's nothing else going on? I don't know what that could be but the situation is just so odd.", "NTA....you bought it and paid for it. It is your suit. I'm sorry for the family. But, that is a weird ask", "nta - While it may seem sweet to his family to have him buried in it, I can assure you that if he took his craft seriously, he would not want to be buried in a suit that isn't tailored to his body. \n\nSurely as a suit maker, he has a suit tailored to his own measurements that will both look better if it's open casket, but also be more significant to his passion?\n\nFurther, your friend made the suit for you, he wanted you to wear it to your wedding, and I can't think of a better action to remember him by, especially if he was also supposed to be part of the wedding party. \n\nFamily is grieving, so they are also not the assholes, but you are assuredly not the asshole.", "NTA, and also you shouldn't return it after the wedding. You paid for it and don't you think your friend would WANT you to have the suit?!\n\nFriend can be buried with any number of suit making tools, swatches of his favorite fabrics, all sorts of things. They don't need the custom suit he made for you. They are just unfortunately redirecting their grief at you\nBut that will pass.", "NTA. Your be honouring him by wearing a special suit he made for you, a way of like being with your best friend for that last time at your wedding. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss man, that is really tough. But yeah, I feel like he would want you to wear it... that's why he made it. I feel like it would honor him.\n\nWhat I will say is, try to be understanding of his family. They lost their son, and I am sure it is a lot for them to take in. Is it right for them to ask for the suit back, no. However, when a loved one passes, you may want to do a lot to hold onto their memory, so I think their reaction makes a some sense,\n\nAnyways, hang in there man, and have a good wedding.", "NTA. Wear the suit. I think it honors your friend more to use the suit as it was intended -specifically for you for your special day.", "NTA, He made the suit for you, I think you'd be honoring him by wearing it. I don't know why they think it's disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nHe made the suit FOR YOU to wear on your special day and I think it's a great way to honor him and for him to still be at the wedding with you.", "NTA - he made the suit for you, right?  I mean, it belongs to you?  Wear the suit to the wedding, and raise a toast to him.", "Look mate, you knew your best friend better than anyone in reddit possibly can, think about it, what would he want it to be, for what reason did he make the suits, in my personal opinion any piece of clothing was made to be worn, i think that as the one who made It, he would be happier by having you use and preserve It, but there are different kinds of people in this world, the suit is yours, by no means do what his family happy, you seem to be willing to let Go of It, so do you think he would be happier for It be with him, as his last work, or do you think he would prefer that you would use it...\n\n\n\nEither way NTA", "Nta \n\nThings are meant to be used, especially this bespoke suit meant for the happy occasion. \n\nI do know some cultures make offerings and place sentimental items at the burial. Sorry about your friend, but ultimately he can't use it now and he wouldn't have if he lived. From a business standpoint, it is your property.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your suit. YOUR SUIT. He made it for you.\n\nAnd it\u2019s for your wedding day. I get that they\u2019re grieving and that they think this would be a nice thing to do, but they\u2019re out of line.\n\n\u201cIt is apparently disrespectful to wear it to the party.\u201d No, it is appropriate and in fact is the perfect way to honour him. He literally made it for you for this day. Wear it for its created purpose. And please please keep it. It\u2019s yours and you deserve that memory too.\n\nThere are other ways to honour his life as a suit-maker without burying him with (not in?!) a suit he custom-made for his best friend for an event that hasn\u2019t yet happened.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nIt was made to fit YOU not HIM and it was gift to YOU.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. \n\nThank goodness this guy wasn\u2019t a builder and built you a house.", "If a suit was tailored to your frame, your build and own personal body there's no possible way it could fit him properly. It would be like putting a house key in a car lock. And you would think they wanted him buried in one of his own suits? Nta and apologies for your loss. But congrats on your wedding", "Soft NAH leaning towards them being the assholes: I don't think you're the asshole here. Your friend made the suit for you. I get where the family are coming from in wanting to keep the last thing he made with him (I made sure that my grandmas favorite crochet hook went with her) but they're not entitled to something that was an agreement between you and your friend. Your friend worked hard on that suit to make it special for your wedding, expected you to wear it for your wedding. How do you think your friend would feel about it? That's the bigger question. (Also, just my opinion on it, but I feel like it would be honoring his memory and keeping a part of him there with you during the wedding to wear the suit.) Good luck, friend.

The family can come up with something much more sentimental to bury with him if they so desire. Burying your suit is ridiculous.", "What in the world?!  Do you and he have the exact same measurements or are they just going to fold it up and tuck it under one of his arms?  I\u2019m so confused, this makes no sense to me. If anything I\u2019d think maybe they\u2019d want it for themselves for sentimental reasons, but whatever this strangeness is is a bit sideways to me. NTA if you keep it and wear it to your wedding and honor your friend\u2763\ufe0f", "NTA at all! Your friend wouldn\u2019t want to be buried with his work, when you create something you want it to be seen and shine. Your friends parents are coming from a place of loss, but they\u2019re wrong. Wear your suit, which you paid for (!!!) and have your friend with you in spirit on the day.", "NTA, very weird request by the family even with them grieving.", "NTA, it would be a disservice to your friend to NOT wear that suit for it's intended purpose. I understand the family is upset, that doesn't give them the right to make this change or take your suit now.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "Also the suit would be sized for OP, not the friend so they\u2019d have to get someone else to alter it or risk ruining the suit which would defeat the purpose", "Yes. Wear it for years to come to honor his memory", "Don't be. They are entitled to their grief, but not YOUR suit. I would think it disrespectful to your friend to just bury it in the ground.  He made it with love for you to wear. That's what artists do!\nNTA", "if u give them the suit will they reimburse you for the money you paid for it?", "Don't feel guilty. What would your friend want? I'm pretty sure he would want his best friend to wear his art work that he he put his blood, sweat, and tears into. I'm also pretty sure your friend would want you to wear his art every chance you got so that you can remember him, honor him, and show his talent. Do not give his family something that you PAID for. You would be honoring your friend by keeping and treasuring it.", "Why would someone who made beautifully tailored, custom-fitted suits want to spend eternity in a suit that didn't fit him? He's not going to have the exact same measurements you do. Besides, he made that suit for *you,*  not for himself; I seriously doubt he would want you to give it away to anyone.", "You honor him by wearing the suit he made for you. You carry him with you whenever you wear it. Don't literally bury his light (work) in the ground. That sounds sick.", "Even if he did, it would be horrible for a custom suit maker to spend eternity in an ill fitting suit.", "Even worse then. Like...are they going to give OP the money back so he can buy a different suit?", "I honestly can\u2019t think of a *sweeter* way to honor your friend than by wearing his last suit - that you absolutely love - when you take your vows for marriage. Just\u2026yeah", "NTA.  I think you should wear it to honor him and keep it.  He made it for you.", "NTA he made it for you to USE it.", "As I read it, you paid for the suit? It's your either way.  Bought or a gift. Use it and honor him that way. NTA.  They are AH for asking and then getting pissed when denied.", "NTA he wanted you to wear the suit on your special day. that would be the best way to honour his memory", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for the loss but congrats on your marriage", "NTA: he made it for you, wear and keep it forever and cherish it. His many is mad weird. I highly doubt you\u2019re friend would find honor in their wishes.", "He was making the suit for you, and presumably you paid for it. You have the right to wear it. NTA", "NTA. He made YOU the suit, and you even paid for it. It's weird and disrespectful of them to expect you to return it just because he made it.", "NTA. He was your friend, you paid for the suit, you should keep it as your memory. I feel for his parents but they have no right to ask you for this suit. I bet there are many more suits that they could choose from.", "You bought the suit and paid for it. It\u2019s yours. You would be NTA on that principle alone.\n\nI get where your friend\u2019s family is coming from. But would your friend **want** this last piece of his work to be buried with him? Or would he want it loved and used by you, both for your wedding and in future?", "NTA\n\nYou purchased this suit from a suit maker, so no you would not give back the suit.", "NTA - I think it's extremely kind of you to offer the suit at all. Maybe it means something to you and you want to keep it? Honestly I don't feel like the family has any claim to it regardless of the unfortunate circumstances surrounding what happened to its maker.", "This breaks my heart. Please wear the suit to your wedding to honor your best friend who made it for you. Then, keep it. It\u2019s yours. NTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand what the family is thinking. How is burying it with him honoring him? He didn\u2019t make it to sit in a closet, let alone a casket.", "Would it even fit him , If it's custom for you?", "They need to focus elsewhere with their grief. That's your beautiful suit and I can't imagine  your friend would not want you to be married in it. Would he have wanted it buried, or enjoyed? It is your suit, and your decision.  I wouldn't have offered to give it to them at all.", "Don't even return it after the wedding!! It's yours. You bought it and paid for it. If the last one he had made had been for a customer who didn't know the family, the family wouldn't be asking for it anyways. Asking for something you *bought and paid for that is customized for you* is a ridiculous request by the family.\n\nNTA but stop doubting yourself and don't give them room to keep pushing this. Don't give it back. It's yours and it honors your friend and it should stay with you.", "Nta. You paid for that suit.", "NTA\n\nYour friend wanted you to wear the suit on your special day. You didn't mention where you are  located so maybe it is a cultural thing but the request to return the suit for burial is odd ... Really odd. Wear the suit and enjoy your day without any guilt. Your friend would have wanted it that way.", "NTA. I don't make suits, but I do make art, and the last thing I'd want is for something I'd made for a good friend that could survive me and keep my memory alive to *literally rot away in darkness with my remains*. Like what the fuck. His family is bonkers, keep the suit (that you BOUGHT!) and think of your friend fondly as you celebrate your wedding.", "NTA\n\nWith all due respect, if you\u2019d been a stranger, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to demand this back.\n\nYour friend made this out of an act of love. It\u2019s something that should be honoured and out on show for his memory. Reused, passed down, reconfigured.", "Sorry if this is an unpopular opinion but\u2026 Honoring your friend is more important than honoring his family. Your friend is no longer able to advocate for himself, and it\u2019s unfair of his family to ignore his wishes just because he can no longer defend them. I understand that they\u2019re grieving, but people still matter even after they\u2019ve become deceased, and discarding his hard work for you and burying a SUIT MAKER in an ill-fitting is so disrespectful that I\u2019m appalled they\u2019re even considering it.", "I highly doubt your friend would actually want any of that.", "Maybe he was an egyptian pharao?", "I don\u2019t believe they intend for him to actually wear it, just to be buried with it", "He made that suit for you, also you paid for the suit.\n\nEither they need to give you the suit or they need to give you the money for it.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.\n\nI hope you have an amazing wedding day", "NTA. They are grieving. I would not give it to the family even after the wedding. By not burying it with him (him not even wearing it), you are actually HONORING your friend. It is made to fit you and you are keeping his memory and art alive. I find it hard to believe that there are no other suits available. Why don\u2019t they try to find the first suit made by him or last he wore. Or even better by their logic, gather ALL the suits he ever made and fabric ever touched to be buried with him. Nonetheless, they are grieving and everyone grieves differently. \n\nI\u2019d write them a letter that is short, sweet, and direct. You are honoring his memory and you are also wearing it to your wedding, and to respect your decision to how you want to personally honor your friend and celebrate your wedding.", "NTA- this isn\u2019t the suit of an dead person. it the suit made by an dead person ( sorry for your lost ). you paid for it. he made it for you. wear it. i\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Also, you PAID for it! Are they willing to reimburse you all of the costs incurred? I doubt it\u2026", "NTA\n\nYour friend specifically made the suit for you.  It's YOUR suit.  They don't get to decide what to do with your belongings. \n\nDon't any of them have a suit your friend made for them?  Or didn't your friend make himself a suit?  Because there shouldn't be any reason that your friend couldn't be buried with a suit that the family owns.", "He made it for you and the best way to honor his memory is to wear it on your big day. That way he can be still part of your wedding. Nta", "NTA\n\nTheir request makes no sense at all. I get it that they're grieving, but this is crazy. \n\nThat suit was specifically made for you. He wanted you to wear it on your special day and clearly it wouldn't fit him. \n\nWear it on your wedding day. Cherish it as he would've wanted you to.", "NTA please wear the suit. This is what your best friend intended you to do. The suit was to be shown to everyone at your wedding. His family are grieving (so are you) and sometimes that makes people act in strange ways. Their request was odd and doesn't make sense. The suit, your best friends art, was intended to be shown off to everyone. That is what your friend wanted otherwise he would never have made you a suit for you wedding.\nYour best friend made the suit for you, it was made for your wedding as a gift. His family can't take back the goft.\n\n You will look back at your wedding photos years from now and will see the suit your best mate made for you. It will be a cherished memory.", "If anyone buried my art instead of having it where people can use it, see it, and enjoy it I'd be pissed! It being my final work, made with love and friendship, would make it worse! No art is created to be locked away, and burying that suit would be destroying his masterpiece. Might as well set it on fire!\n\nNo, don't erase that piece of him from the world! Respect his work by using it as intended and making sure people can see the beauty he brought into your life, and honor what he created by not purposely destroying it.", "OP said the family wants to bury the suit with him, not on him.  Bespoke suits are made for one person, unless the two men were identical in size, it would be ill fitted."]}
