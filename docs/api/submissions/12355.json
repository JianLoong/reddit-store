When I got there my brother was there. I gave my daughter to my grandfather and spoke to my brother in a different room. I explained again he couldn't meet my daughter yet and why. He was upset and said he felt like I was punishing after he already repaid his debt to society.\n\nI told him I'm married and that means I can't go behind her back to do things she doesn't want and have to prioritize her feelings and wants over other people's, including my siblings, especially when it comes to our kid. He said she doesn't need to know, and I said that attitude was exactly his issue. My dad said I was an asshole for saying that. I left with my daughter and told my wife what happened.

It is kind of insensitive to your brother, and awkward as he was in the next room. BUT you do have an obligation to your wife and if she had already said no, then no it is. \n\nHim going BACK to prison is a weird reason to say no to a meet and greet. I mean, people move out of state all the time, you could easily say that a to child. However if he was in prison for drugs then there's the reality that he could go back or relapse, if he was in prison for killing someone, that's obvious. Tax evasion? what's the big deal?\n\nFor transparency, my brother was also in prison for being on drugs and committing crimes. My ex husband did NOT want him around our kids and for the most part we stuck to that. He OD'ed and died shortly after his prison release, so if he had never had met the kids in the first place, it would have been a way easier time on them and me.", "I know it may be much to ask but what was he in prison for? Is he violent?", "INFO: I guess a lot of this depends on what he went to prison for. I mean if it was burglary that's a lot different than \"he's on certain lists now\" type stuff. Also I don't think I'm agreeing with your wife's premise of he could have to go away and that'll be too hard, I mean relatives also can potentially move across country or whatever and people don't avoid having their kids meet them because of that you know?
