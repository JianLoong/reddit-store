She said that would be too hard on our daughter to lose someone she has a relationship with like that.\n\nMy dad invited me to his house after work yesterday and said to bring my daughter, so he and my grandfather could hang out with her. When I got there my brother was there. I gave my daughter to my grandfather and spoke to my brother in a different room. I explained again he couldn't meet my daughter yet and why. He was upset and said he felt like I was punishing after he already repaid his debt to society.\n\nI told him I'm married and that means I can't go behind her back to do things she doesn't want and have to prioritize her feelings and wants over other people's, including my siblings, especially when it comes to our kid. He said she doesn't need to know, and I said that attitude was exactly his issue. My dad said I was an asshole for saying that. I left with my daughter and told my wife what happened.

It is kind of insensitive to your brother, and awkward as he was in the next room. BUT you do have an obligation to your wife and if she had already said no, then no it is. \n\nHim going BACK to prison is a weird reason to say no to a meet and greet. I mean, people move out of state all the time, you could easily say that a to child. However if he was in prison for drugs then there's the reality that he could go back or relapse, if he was in prison for killing someone, that's obvious. Tax evasion? what's the big deal?\n\nFor transparency, my brother was also in prison for being on drugs and committing crimes. My ex husband did NOT want him around our kids and for the most part we stuck to that. He OD'ed and died shortly after his prison release, so if he had never had met the kids in the first place, it would have been a way easier time on them and me.", "I know it may be much to ask but what was he in prison for? Is he violent?", "INFO: I guess a lot of this depends on what he went to prison for. I mean if it was burglary that's a lot different than \"he's on certain lists now\" type stuff. Also I don't think I'm agreeing with your wife's premise of he could have to go away and that'll be too hard, I mean relatives also can potentially move across country or whatever and people don't avoid having their kids meet them because of that you know? Until you give us more and assuming your brother was in jail for a non-violent offense I'd have to side more with your family here, she's being out of line and it seems more her personal bias than anything else.", "I N F O: What did your brother do that landed him in prison and probabtion?\n\nEDIT: YTA and same as your wife.\n\nSo y\u2019all reason for him to not have a relationship with his niece is just because he was in prison?

This isn\u2019t the world you grew up in, the world your daughter will grow up in will have very little secrets.

You made it sound like you were ambushed without your wife by your family, and that makes them assholes. Clearly they invited you without your wife because of her attitude towards your brother.\n\n\"Blood family\", in my opinion, entitles you to nothing, but I do wonder what is your personal opinion on this, do you want your daughter to meet your brother or not? Are you just following what your wife says? If you disagree with her would you advocate for your opinion?\n\nYou and your wife seem like YTA because we don't know the crime your brother committed, and no offence, the whole post was about what your wife wanted and you didn't mention your own opinion.

On top of that it doesn\u2019t seem like OP wants it to be this way, he\u2019s just respecting his wife because while it\u2019s his kid, it\u2019s also hers so she has a VERY large say, no matter how irrational it seems.", "Op stated in a comment that they are wanting to see his brother turn his life around including not abusing substances and not running around in a crowd that does crimes. \n\nI think its fair to not want your child to normalize going to jail often.

Something that shows he has plans for a future on the outside.", "We're not worried about him being violent towards her or my wife. My brother would never hit a woman.

Your mindset on convicts seems pretty close minded tbh, by your logic all convicts should never be released then, regardless of the weight of the crime from tax evasion to possession of weed.

That mindset is concerning, and very telling ive known family friends that used to be in prison and now run businesses and lead successful lives within the law, but convicts are always convicts right?", "Damn so you believe there is no such thing as rehabilitation? You want everyone in jail on minor drug use possession to be labeled as terrible pos their whole lives?

She won't be seeing them again and that will be traumatic for her.", "That doesn't make sense you know.

It's bs the US criminalizes drug use. It's only made the problem worse since Nixon began the War on Drugs (that's totally been lost), because people hide their usr since they don't want to go to jail,the black market has no regulated infrastructure so the product is often tainted or masked to look like something else, and federal money goes to prisons instead of expanding evidence-based medical/MH treatment. You both are judgmental AHs in this and part of the problem. Try for some human decency and show your BIL some family love, instead of acting like he's the dog poop on your shoe.", "Well then if you 2 really do care about your brother, get active in his life, help him rehabilitate the best parts of himself. Insinuating that he\u2019s not morally good enough to meet your daughter can\u2019t be good for his mental health right now.

The baby won't even know what is going on and is way, way too young to form some sort of attachment to the uncle right now. That being said, they agreed to this as a couple, the dad and grandpa knew the score and decided to have the uncle there when they knew OP was coming by with the baby. Had the uncle popped by unannounced at the dad's house while OP was there or the uncle ran into OP and wife w/ baby somewhere, then it happens. OP is right here to be upset to a degree. \n\nI get why they want the uncle to meet the baby but they don't get to override the parents' choice.", "Then NTA.

Some kind of white collar thing. His kids were definitely not happy, but as niblings, we weren\u2019t affected much.

Trust me, I definitely get where you\u2019re coming from. 100% but when you\u2019re married and you have a child, decisions like \u201cwho can our kid be around?\u201d Are joint decisions. Of course the reasoning is ridiculous. But they are reasons and they\u2019re hers. She\u2019s the mother and if he agrees to this then he has to honor it.

I'm not saying that guy didn't deserve it, but my brother chose to be a part of that life and put himself in that situation. This isn't about drugs, although drugs played a part. This is about impulse control, of which my brother needs to demonstrate the capacity for. I didn't want to mention this, because now my post will probably be removed for the violence rule. Anyway, we love my brother, but that doesn't mean he has to be around our kid before he's proven he's ready.", "That's not my responsibility. I'm busy. I have a baby and a full-time job.

But I still don't think that means they will be there constantly.  Hell, one of my best friends lives maybe a 10 minute walk from me.
