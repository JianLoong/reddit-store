If people volunteer to cook, then that\u2019s okay but roping people into it is not cool and also, as proven here, probably not the safest option.\n\nAs for the not booking enough rooms and expecting people to suck it up with no notice is just selfish.", "NTA. Wow, that sounds like a real clusterfuck, a lot of which could have been avoided if suggestions had been taken or communication been better. Like, I can go with the flow pretty well, but being left at a place alone, no food for hours and hours on top of manual labor, getting sick because of food poisoning, etc. There's a LOT that went wrong and haywire. It doesn't sound like you're kvetching about the situation to the bride to her or your mutual friends, but to people only you know. I think you're allowed to vent about how much stress the event caused you even though the bride had a lot on her plate. They can both be true at the same time.", "NTA. In future, though, it is OK to say \u201cI\u2019ve had enough\u201d even if it is the day of someone\u2019s wedding. After being left at a random location, I would have personally just been done with decorating. Amazed if they have any friends left after wild goose chase / food poisoning event.", "NTA. You didn't sign up for a cluster, dehydration, starvation or food poisoning.", "NTA.\nYou were tasked to help and there was little to no organization on her part, on top of the severe lack of communication for those that are there for you.\nI'm glad that they loved it and there is nothing wrong with doing it yourself, but when planning it yourself you do need to be considerate and not waste the time for those helping you. Most of this would be avoided with solid communication.", "NTA- she sounds almost like a tweaker or someone w/ severe adhd.", "They clearly had a really really tight budget, which you knew ahead of time and yet you still choose to attend. It's one day, just be happy for the bride and groom.", "ESH. It's not that you are wrong to feel some kind of way about the bride's ineptitude. If it was me, I'd have walked out on the whole mess less than halfway through and never looked back on what would be left of this friendship. But you went on trashing her to mutual friends, people who were there. That's bad form. Here, anonymously, OK, get it off your chest. But in your crowd, now people think less of you. Not worth it -- if you plan to remain in this crowd.", "Honestly, it sounds like it may have actually been fun\u2014train wreck that it was. The bride  got in the middle of everything happening and the DOING of it was the most important part. Memories were made.  Refreshing to hear about a bride who did not get all bent out of shape over things not going smoothly.  It sounds like the bride enjoyed the day with her friends.   Really, if the bride and groom were happy about the way everything went, why wouldn\u2019t you be happy for them too?  YTA", "ESH.  I'm not about to call you the only AH when people got avoidable food poisoning and were expected to manage without water for nine hours, but no need to complain about it.

Do not ever do a single thing for her again unless she\u2019s got an actual plan outlined.", "NTA, the bride sould selfish as F. Might be best to stay LC with her!.", "The bride had a lot on everyone else's plate. Including illness from the food she prepared. That right there is a huge screw up. How can anyone not be critical reading this. To save some pennies she risked exhaustion, headaches and potential food poisoning. Caterers cost money because they know how to cook, know hot to time the food and avoid at all costs getting people sick. I am surprised most people are not complaining. \n\nNTA for being pissed at the bride but at this point there is not much you can do except never agree to help her for any event including dinner at her house.", "That\u2019s the thing! If she had only said prior to the day of she wanted us to cook, that would have been fine! I could have planned to come earlier and helped with it! But literally I found out she canceled the paid for catering (that she didn\u2019t pay for so no clue how us cooking it saved her any money, if anything it cost more because she had to buy all the food goods) when I arrived. By then it was too late for anything to be prepared in advance. \n\nShe tried to leave the food out overnight, and someone stopped her. \n\nIt was frustrating", "Thank you!!! I just wanted to vent to my friends who didn\u2019t know her when they asked me! I didn\u2019t think I had to lie and say I had a great time. I was hungry, overwhelmed, and got sick. I wasn\u2019t trying to say the bride was at fault. It just came across as such since a lot of it happened as a direct result of her actions and attitude. \n\nThere were other crappy things like the best man creeping on me. But my pro bride friends just gloss over that. Other friends just took it as face value and was like damn your weekend sucked. \n\nBut I was feeling doubtful like it\u2019s a bride I can\u2019t complain about her.", "Exactly! If you couldn't find them, they couldn't find you! I'd have found a bar to stay in until ceremony time.", "That was the most frustrating part. Just no communication, I\u2019d ask a direct question and get no answer.

Too many brides and grooms forget other people should at the least have a decent time if they are giving their time to celebrate with them.", "She said she enjoyed it, but was snappy and angry with all of us the whole time. She seemed stressed and strung out the whole time. But post wedding she was quite pleased with all the pictures\u2026 \n\nI got in trouble for getting myself water and not being with the photographer. Which I was told photography was 1pm for me. It was moved to 11am and I was not told.\n\nOne bridesmaid had car trouble and was not greeted or spoken to the entire wedding since she was late for rehearsal.\n\nTHEY had a good time. Which I\u2019m glad they did. But No one else did. So when I was asked, I answered. It didn\u2019t go well. I did not tell anyone who knows her this though, as I\u2019m entirely unclear how much was her being malicious and how much was just being oblivious. She did take on to much.", "I only complained when asked how did it go. Told it how it was- it sucked for me. And only to people who did not know her.", "I really would have minded any of it, but she asked for advice, and just flat out ignored it. When I offered to do something it was turned down. When told to do something there was no directions. I complained to my friends who were not affiliated or knew her personally. I didn\u2019t want her to feel embarrassed. But man I was stressed, so when my friends asked how it went I told them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f for me it sucked.\n\nThe list was just for Reddit and not block text. When I complained it\u2019s more of a rambling.", "Spoiler: the bride *was* at fault", "If I could have drank I would have. Stupid meds got me dry right now. Ugh! I had tried to have hard boundaries going in, only did what was directly asked. Which unfortunately just turned out to be a lot.\n\nI regret eating the food. I was suspicious of it but starving. All the regrets.", "Exactly. No context.\nAs someone speaking from experience, it's best to overcommunicate accurately and annoy some people than to be vague.\nI'd keep the frustration to yourself honestly so that the bride and groom don't have that memory spoiled or throw issues your way, but I'd be hesitant to let them plan anything.", "You're welcome-glad you can laugh over it by this point, tho many don't find tweakers very funny.", "Not entirely but it's a big help. Nearly all of OPs suggestions around organisation involved paying someone to be of assistance, whether it was catering or an on the day manager.\n\nThis wedding was clearly done on a shoestring budget. No amount of organisation was gonna make the day stress free because everyone had a dozen jobs that couldn't be outsourced without a cost. It could definitely have been better organised but being a good party organiser is a skill that ppl without money - who rarely host more formal events - never really get an opportunity to develop.\n\nThese are supposedly OPs good friends and it was only one day .... Just be happy for them.", "As you can see, you got little sympathy for your trouble and made yourself look bad into the bargain.

If people are telling you to ease up, this is a viable alternative response.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m getting the picture it\u2019s best not to complain to others, I tried to only speak to people not affiliated with the couple (not hard I live in a separate state) and only when asked. But still people don\u2019t seem to understand, I can be happy they had a good wedding and also frustrated by the effect of their actions on me. \n\nSo I\u2019ll just complain anonymously online", "I mean true, but it was nice to vent. I can\u2019t undo who I vented to though. I\u2019ll just keep the complaints about this\nwedding to reddit from here in.", "The people with food poisoning disagree.", "No clue if she feels bad or not, I have not broached the subject nor plan to. She said she enjoyed it so that\u2019s it.", "You have to vent somewhere.\n\nI tell my kids - there are two kinds of people in this world, the people who plan, and those who don\u2019t.  When you are the former, the latter are infuriating when it comes to stuff like this.\nSure we planner folk could loosen up sometimes - but some shit just needs proper planning.\n\nWhen they have kids, she\u2019ll totally be the parent posting in the Mum\u2019s group the night before the book week parade in search of a costume."]}
