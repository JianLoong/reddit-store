Wow, that sounds like a real clusterfuck, a lot of which could have been avoided if suggestions had been taken or communication been better. Like, I can go with the flow pretty well, but being left at a place alone, no food for hours and hours on top of manual labor, getting sick because of food poisoning, etc. There's a LOT that went wrong and haywire. It doesn't sound like you're kvetching about the situation to the bride to her or your mutual friends, but to people only you know. I think you're allowed to vent about how much stress the event caused you even though the bride had a lot on her plate. They can both be true at the same time.", "NTA.

Most of this would be avoided with solid communication.", "NTA- she sounds almost like a tweaker or someone w/ severe adhd.", "They clearly had a really really tight budget, which you knew ahead of time and yet you still choose to attend.

If it was me, I'd have walked out on the whole mess less than halfway through and never looked back on what would be left of this friendship. But you went on trashing her to mutual friends, people who were there. That's bad form. Here, anonymously, OK, get it off your chest. But in your crowd, now people think less of you. Not worth it -- if you plan to remain in this crowd.", "Honestly, it sounds like it may have actually been fun\u2014train wreck that it was. The bride  got in the middle of everything happening and the DOING of it was the most important part. Memories were made.  Refreshing to hear about a bride who did not get all bent out of shape over things not going smoothly.  It sounds like the bride enjoyed the day with her friends.

Might be best to stay LC with her!.", "The bride had a lot on everyone else's plate. Including illness from the food she prepared. That right there is a huge screw up. How can anyone not be critical reading this. To save some pennies she risked exhaustion, headaches and potential food poisoning. Caterers cost money because they know how to cook, know hot to time the food and avoid at all costs getting people sick. I am surprised most people are not complaining. \n\nNTA for being pissed at the bride but at this point there is not much you can do except never agree to help her for any event including dinner at her house.", "That\u2019s the thing! If she had only said prior to the day of she wanted us to cook, that would have been fine! I could have planned to come earlier and helped with it! But literally I found out she canceled the paid for catering (that she didn\u2019t pay for so no clue how us cooking it saved her any money, if anything it cost more because she had to buy all the food goods) when I arrived. By then it was too late for anything to be prepared in advance. \n\nShe tried to leave the food out overnight, and someone stopped her. \n\nIt was frustrating", "Thank you!!! I just wanted to vent to my friends who didn\u2019t know her when they asked me! I didn\u2019t think I had to lie and say I had a great time. I was hungry, overwhelmed, and got sick. I wasn\u2019t trying to say the bride was at fault. It just came across as such since a lot of it happened as a direct result of her actions and attitude. \n\nThere were other crappy things like the best man creeping on me. But my pro bride friends just gloss over that. Other friends just took it as face value and was like damn your weekend sucked. \n\nBut I was feeling doubtful like it\u2019s a bride I can\u2019t complain about her.", "Exactly!

No context.\nAs someone speaking from experience, it's best to overcommunicate accurately and annoy some people than to be vague.\nI'd keep the frustration to yourself honestly so that the bride and groom don't have that memory spoiled or throw issues your way, but I'd be hesitant to let them plan anything.", "You're welcome-glad you can laugh over it by this point, tho many don't find tweakers very funny.", "Not entirely but it's a big help. Nearly all of OPs suggestions around organisation involved paying someone to be of assistance, whether it was catering or an on the day manager.\n\nThis wedding was clearly done on a shoestring budget. No amount of organisation was gonna make the day stress free because everyone had a dozen jobs that couldn't be outsourced without a cost. It could definitely have been better organised but being a good party organiser is a skill that ppl without money - who rarely host more formal events - never really get an opportunity to develop.\n\nThese are supposedly OPs good friends and it was only one day ....

She clearly had almost nothing on her plate to begin with.", "NTA, the bride is a selfish ah who is obviously not thinking about the needs of her guests at a MOUNTAIN RECEPTION!

And who caters for their own wedding?!", "I mean I wouldn\u2019t do of done this, but she stated she had an itinerary,  I Asked her to print it out, she said yes. She did not print it. I get the filling she lied about nearly everything I had asked her prior to the day of. I even asked her at one point if she wanted me to pick up a fruit platter or something for the morning of for people. She said she had sandwiches planned for us. \n\nNow I know she doesn\u2019t have anything planned ever.", "Yeah I\u2019m not helping her again. Also the caterer was paid for by someone else, not the bride. It was a gift to her. Her costs were zero for food, then she changed it last minute. From my understanding the person who bought and paid for catering got stuck with a lot of food as it was to last minute to cancel and get at least some money back.", "Speaking as a bride, yes you fucking can. You can complain about anyone you please. \n\nIt\u2019s *nice* to give brides a little extra grace for momentary lapses in patience and/or sanity, given the extra pressure that comes with being The Bride. But it doesn\u2019t sound like this bride noticed (or cared) that her wedding was messy and uncomfortable. There\u2019s really no reason you shouldn\u2019t feel free to say the wedding was shitty, because it was, and it\u2019s *directly* the fault of the people who planned it. The major drawback of a DIY wedding is that you have no one else to point fingers at if something goes horribly wrong.", "Is she always so spaced out?", "Unbelievable that she had the catering paid and didn\u2019t use it. I wonder why. Well now you know and I wish you happy in whatever you do in life!! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude01", "Thank you so much, I was starting to feel crazy.

Oh and catering was paid for BY SOMEONE ELSE. Like as a gift to the bride, which she accepted, and then at some point turned down? And did not tell anyone. I also suggested all inclusive options (like a cruise for example), which overall was cheaper than her budget. I even offered up my own wedding decor from my own wedding, which was denied. She bought hers full retail, I even suggested waiting for dates it would go on sale, that was turned down to. \n\nI was fully aware of her budget. But it\u2019s just easier to write she \u201cdidn\u2019t pay anyone or assigned any roles to others\u201d than to explain all the details. Like so much help was offered and turned down in a lot of forms (I even asked her at one point was my advice unwanted? Like I thought I was being pushy, but she assured me no, and asked for advice). Honest thinking she wanted validation for decisions she already made but just didn\u2019t say that outright looking in hindsight.", "I have no clue, I get the feeling she wanted to prove she could do it. And thank you!", "You get to do that! Consider it your wedding favor. You\u2019re not even complaining *at* the bride, so I genuinely don\u2019t know why anyone is giving you grief.

You didn't have to go, you could have said no, you didn't have a gun to your head, you choose to attend and it was a stressful day ... So what? Your friends used their mini wedding budget to successfully make a day that was what they wanted.

Everyone including the bride and groom getting food poisoning? \n\nI'm guessing she doesn't want to admit what a clusterfuck it was and is saving face by saying it was great.\n\nMaybe years down the track she may look back and laugh, but the embarrassment sounds like it's still too fresh to laugh about.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not their fault they gave zero directions and poisoned their guests with poorly handled food!
