{"id": 29020, "submission_id": "178z0zo", "title": "AITA for scolding my husband for using the term 'babysitting' when referring to our own kids?", "selftext": "This is so silly but I think it's helpful to get some outside perspective.\n\nI (35f) am a SAHM and I have two kids (6m) and (4f) with my husband (37m) of 7 years. My husband usually goes to the office but his job gives him the flexibility of working from home whenever he wants. My husband is a good father and partner. Unlike many men I know, he is family man and does more than his fair share for our children and household. \n\nMoving on to the issue at hand, last month I was supposed to go on a week-long girls trip with a few of my college friends. The previous week, my husband was at home when he received a call from his boss. Before he ended the call, he told his boss he would be working remotely the following week as he would be \"babysitting the kiddos\".\n\nThis was the first time I've heard my husband use that word but hearing it triggered me because my father used to view childcare as my mom's job and not his equal obligation. I corrected my husband and told him that he doesn't babysit our kids, he parents them. He looked confused and said he couldn't think of another word in the moment. I told him I understood, but I was only correcting him because it's not the appropriate word to use when referring to our own children. He asked me if he wasn't pulling his weight as a husband or as a father. When I said no, he then accused me of making a mountain out of a molehill. We went back and forth before he finally agreed he wouldn't use the word 'babysit' anymore.\n\nHowever, since then, I've noticed he's been acting a little petty. Whenever he talks to his family or his friends about what he's up to or what his plans are, he says \"I'm PARENTING my children\". He makes it a point to emphasize 'parenting' in my presence which I think is silly because he can easily just say he's looking after them but I think he just wants to make a point. I was chatting with my sister the other day and she agreed with him that I made a big deal out of nothing and should have let the matter go especially since he isn't slacking at home.

If you asked me to watch your kids, I'm babysitting them because I'm only responsible for them from 4pm until 10pm and then they simply aren't my problem anymore.  And I might have gotten a free pizza out of it.  I don't have to think about what your kids are up to the moment I leave the driveway.  \n\nNext time you are responsible for your kiddos, tell your husband or family that you are BABYSITTING the kids.  See how he responds.\n\nNTA", "A better word is have. Take care of the kids works, too. Parenting the kids sounds too removed or formal or even too much like corporate talk, the bane of normal communication everywhere. \n\nI had or watched the kids when my wife was busy.", "Language is important. \n\nHe is not babysitting, he is taking care of his children.\n\nNTA.", "NTA if you have the kid you are NEVER babysitting you are parenting. It's like a husband whining having to do his wifes chores. NO it's not your wifes chores it's household chores and since you live there you should help out too. I'm sorry but I hear to many men use babysitting when referring to their kids as if half the reason why they're here isn't them.", "It was the first time he used the term.  I understand your ears pricking up and wonder at the meaning.   I've wondered why fathers get away with using the term myself. I think some fathers use the term because they think they are babysitting due to their hands off role.  And others use the term as a descriptor in the moment.   You may have learned what your hubby meant if you'd asked.\n\nBut you 'corrected' your husband... woah.   A question may have been in order.  A quick comment with a laugh maybe.  But a correction is aggressive and putting him on the defensive.   Which he was.  And you pursued him until he 'finally agreed'.    Now you believe he's being petty.  Is another correction in order? \n\nNow listen here.  You mustn't use the word 'triggered'.   As soon as I saw that I was upset because there is a particular context for that word.  If I am triggered by something, often subtle, something has happened that has set me back to a memory of past trauma and the feelings of the incident.  I've got to work hard in that moment to stay present and try not to react.  For you to be 'triggered' to remember your fathers parenting philosophy demeans me and the abuse that I survived.  It's not an appropriate word for you to use.  You must agree to never use this word again. \n\nSee what I did there?  I corrected you.  What I've said is true.   Yet I say it in such a way as to put you down,  make you inferior to me,  and insist on my truth being your truth.  Could I have spoken to you in a different way?   I sure could've.   Another option would've been for me to say nothing as you aren't someone I'll ever see.... and not make a big deal of it. \n\nYTA", "My wife and I both say \u201cI\u2019m on kid duty\u201d when we\u2019re solo-parenting. \nI can\u2019t imagine using the term \u201cbabysitting\u201d in regards to my own kids. \nNAH, you\u2019re both just being a touch too sensitive.", "You're making a mountain out of a molehill and just wanted to pick a fight, the man is a good husband and father yet you're concerned about words, real life isnt the internet, grow up.", "YTA.  You got mad at him for using the term baby sitting and told him parenting is the proper term. He now makes sure to use the term parenting in you presence.  Now you are mad at him for listening to you. \n\nYou sound exhausting.  Your poor husband works all day so you can be a SAHM a luxury this day in age and his reward is putting up with your nonsense.  You sound exhausting .", "YTA you made a mountain out of a molehill and parenting is a stupid verb. \n\nHe does more than his fair share, is a family man, has to work and watch his kids for a week (honestly not fair - you should have arranged proper childcare instead of expecting him to watch the kids and provide the sole income) \u2026but he didn\u2019t complain. \n\nOnly you complained. Because you didn\u2019t like a word he used. If you had to open your mouth you could have just said \u201choney, you\u2019re such a good dad, don\u2019t use the term babysitting or others will think you normally don\u2019t care for the kids. Use watch\u201d \n\nAt this point, be happy he\u2019s still covering for you.", "Actions speak louder than words. You say he's a great father, then turn around and bust his chops over something so petty? \n\nYTA.", "It's funny. My brother has always been the primary caretaker for his children. Guess who is more likely to label his parenting \"babysitting\"?\n\n\nWomen\n\n\nThere's a reason why babysitting was the first thing that popped into his head, and it's not because he doesn't effectively parent, OP has admitted as much. It's because we live in a society that denigrates a man's ability to be a parent. That views it as less than. So of course that's worked his way into his consciousness, because he's probably heard it a million times when he's been parenting solo. And not just from random people, but from family, friends, and I'm willing to bet OP has even done it without thinking.\n\n\nSeriously, how many of you live in states where it's impossible to find a changing station in a men's room? Guess what, those aren't automatically installed by businesses. Changing stations in men's rooms generally have to be mandated by law\n\n\nOP, you are making a mountain out of a molehill, and the only reason I'm going to say YTA is because of your assumption that this one use of the word has some deeper meaning when your husband's actual behavior shows that not to be the case. Again, you admit as much. He's being petty because you hurt him and refused to listen. You owe him an apology.", "YTA. You definitely created an issue out of nothing. He wasn't even complaining about having to watch aka babysit aka parent the children while you're off with your friends. You owe him an apology. I'm sure you can see that your \"parenting\" phrase has become a sore point for him leading to the passive mockery.\n\nDon't take out the issues/frustration you had/have with your dad on your husband. That's not fair at all.", "YTA.\n\nHe's a good dad and partner this really the hill you wana die on? Choose your battles", "A father or a parent doesn\u2019t babysit his children. You\u2019re right to be pissed.", ">I was chatting with my sister the other day and she agreed with him that I made a big deal out of nothing and should have let the matter go especially since he isn't slacking at home. \n\nYour sister already told you YTA, how many other people gotta say it?", "Do you like it when your husband does the whole \"actually\" routine on you? ACTUALLY, you're parenting not babysitting. ACTUALLY, the sky is clear not blue, light refraction makes it look blue. Etc etc.\n\nAlso he wasn't talking to you, he was explaining to his boss why he would be remote working using terminology he knew his boss would understand. YTA", "Soft YTA. He just said it because like he said, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else in the moment. Not really a big deal considering you know that\u2019s not his actual mindset, as you did say he\u2019s a great father. Now I don\u2019t think you made a mountain necessarily out of a mole hill, it\u2019s not that bad, but it sounds like you made it bigger than it needed to be", "YTA. Your husband is talking to a third party. Saying \u201cbabysitting\u201d signals his presence will be required at all times. \u201cParenting\u201d is something you do together continuously. He used language efficiently to communicate a message to the person on the other end of the phone. \n\nIf a coworker would tell me he won\u2019t be in the office because he is parenting his kids, I will be confused. Does he imply he isn\u2019t parenting otherwise? If he says he needs to babysit his kids, I understand his partner isn\u2019t available.", "YTA, and this crazy \u201cthis word triggers me but that word that basically means the same thing does not\u201d seems to everywhere.", "Wife and i both use the term babysitting while refering to babysit the kids while the other is out with friends or something. not meaning it in any negative way. there is way to much negativity pinned on the word imo. slight YTA there for", "NTA for correcting him, he shouldn\u2019t use that word for his own children and needs to break the cycle himself\u2026 What if the kids heard him say that? What would they think if their dad sees being their father as \u201cbabysitting\u201d? It\u2019s not something to fight about but it is a simple thing for him to correct.\n\nNow onto his behavior\u2026 if he\u2019s still holding a grudge and being petty about it, it might be something you need to address further. Simply ask him, \u201cdoes it bother you that I told you you shouldn\u2019t saying babysitting?\u201d Let him know what you\u2019ve noticed and that you want to know how he feels. Hear him out and validate his feelings. Make sure to remind him of all the things you just told us about his parenting habits and that you appreciate him. That might help with the resentment. You can do all this and still hold firm that he shouldn\u2019t say babysitting.", "YTA. I think nearly 100% of people say what your husband said.", "It depends. What do you call it when it\u2019s you having the kids? Use the same terms.", "Hmm. Gentle YTA\n\nOne, he explained himself: it was the first word that popped into his mind that explained his need to work remotely outside his normal schedule/rotation/whatever. But you wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t let it go?\n\nSecond, as you confirmed yourself, he pulls his weight around the house.\n\nThird, whatever issues your mother and father may have had, or you perhaps had with your father, it would be best not to bring that into your marriage. We have to manage our own triggers.\n\nLast, anecdotally (and for transparency/perspective) I tend to primarily use \u201cI\u2019m parenting my kids\u201d as well, because they\u2019re my kids, not someone else\u2019s.

A \u201cgirls trip\u201d would qualify and I might well say \u201cyeah I\u2019m watching the kids myself this week while my wife is out of town\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m babysitting the kids\u201d while my wife is unavailable.", "YTA. \n\nIts not about you correcting him. Its about how you do it. You could've simple said, in a  joking way, \"you know its not called babysitting when they are your kids, right?\". \n\nBut, from what you said, you were very abrasive about it and you didnt let it go when he explain himself. You kept going until you got your way. \n\nAnd now, that he is using the correct term, and he is doing it for you to hear, you are mad, AGAIN! Seems like you just want to fight. The man, as you said, does more than his fair share, he seems like a good husband and a good father.

It really isn't something to dwell on.", "YTA\n\nIt's a word. It may not be entirely appropriate, but you fully admit that he's an involved father and husband, so you having made an issue out of a single word spoken to his boss is ridiculous.\n\nIf you keep going around looking to create mountains out of molehills, your marriage probably will not last long.", "This is a good man who is caring and responsible.

YTA.", "Yeah, obviously YTA.", "NTA. Many men are great fathers to their children and partners to their SO. However, using the term \"babysitting\" when talking about the care of your own children speaks to a specific mindset. \"She takes care of the kids, but I'm **just babysitting** them while she's grocery shopping.\" The prevailing societal idea is that the job of **caring for** the kids falls to the mother, and anyone else who is essentially stepping in temporarily is just **babysitting**.", "NTA for your feelings or pointing it out but depending on how you said it (tone, phrasing) , you may be slightly TA. \n\nI feel like your words choice may be part of the issue as well. \"parenting\" them sounds like they need to be disciplined or something.

If not then this probably does seem excessively semantic and dumb. Id be careful telling him at this point if not because he may think you're trying to accuse him of being like your dad. But it would explain his response if he doesn't know.", "YTA. This really is making to big of a deal out of this. Babysitting and watching are often interchangeable. Neither of your children are even technically babies, it\u2019s called a euphemism treadmill. It\u2019s just like we call any room with a toilet a bathroom even if you can\u2019t take a bath in it.", "Watching your own kids isn't babysitting.  It's patenting.

Especially since he MIGHT have, conciously or Not, been trying to give his boss/coworkers the impression of being in a marriage where gender roles DO work such that looking after his Kids functionally IS Babysitting. For whatever reason, like to assert dominance.", "YTA. \n\nBabysitting is an aspect of parenting. You're creating issues where they do not need to exist.", "INFO: is your husband aware of the fact that he triggered you?\n\nGenerally I would say action speaks louder than words and he seems to be pulling his weight accordingly.

I suspect that instead you meant \"more than a lot of dads do\", because usually it is expected that dads do less than mums, but he does more than a lot of dads.

Usually it's better to take a step back think for a bit and then bring up concerns rather than be confrontational about them.", "NTA. I can understand how the word would be upsetting.

It sounded to me like you handled it well: you didn't fly off the handle, give him the silent treatment, burst into tears or anything -- you told him the word was inappropriate and said he shouldn't use it. He's the one who's made the mountain out of it.\n\nSome commenters are saying the word is fine, others are saying no it's not.

If I ask for it I might get it, or he'll randomly say here and there that I need a break or should get time off, but it's not something he's focused on making happen. And because of his obsession with needing his time, I don't like to ask because there is a 60/40 chance that it will be stressful / challenging and instead of getting a break, I'll come home to everybody unhappy. \n\nSome men really struggle with accepting that parenthood means your life is not your own anymore.

Babysitting implies someone who is not a primary caregiver taking care of a child or children, usually for money. \n\nYou don't babysit your own kids.", "NTA. you explained why the term is off-putting, and your point is valid.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis is so silly but I think it's helpful to get some outside perspective.\n\nI (35f) am a SAHM and I have two kids (6m) and (4f) with my husband (37m) of 7 years. My husband usually goes to the office but his job gives him the flexibility of working from home whenever he wants. My husband is a good father and partner. Unlike many men I know, he is family man and does more than his fair share for our children and household. \n\nMoving on to the issue at hand, last month I was supposed to go on a week-long girls trip with a few of my college friends. The previous week, my husband was at home when he received a call from his boss. Before he ended the call, he told his boss he would be working remotely the following week as he would be \"babysitting the kiddos\".\n\nThis was the first time I've heard my husband use that word but hearing it triggered me because my father used to view childcare as my mom's job and not his equal obligation. I corrected my husband and told him that he doesn't babysit our kids, he parents them. He looked confused and said he couldn't think of another word in the moment. I told him I understood, but I was only correcting him because it's not the appropriate word to use when referring to our own children. He asked me if he wasn't pulling his weight as a husband or as a father. When I said no, he then accused me of making a mountain out of a molehill. We went back and forth before he finally agreed he wouldn't use the word 'babysit' anymore.\n\nHowever, since then, I've noticed he's been acting a little petty. Whenever he talks to his family or his friends about what he's up to or what his plans are, he says \"I'm PARENTING my children\". He makes it a point to emphasize 'parenting' in my presence which I think is silly because he can easily just say he's looking after them but I think he just wants to make a point. I was chatting with my sister the other day and she agreed with him that I made a big deal out of nothing and should have let the matter go especially since he isn't slacking at home. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You pointed out language you didn't like in what seems like a very respectful way, and I'm not sure why he got offended by it.

It doesn't sounds like he's \"babysitting\" his kids, he's actually parenting them, so why is he making a mountain out of a molehill but refusing to adjust the language? \n\nThe reason she's pushing back is because the language itself, used in the context it's being used, is offensive.

Why can't she point this out, and why can't he use a different word?

If they go out for the night, dinner, movie, etc. and then get a babysitter, the babysitter is literally parenting the baby, so yes, the two different words mean the exact same thing.", "Yes it does have that problem. \n\nBut one of the benefits babysit has is that it leaves the reason you are on sole parental duty unspoken. If I tell you I am unavailable because I am babysitting the kids, you can infer that my partner is away and that I am taking sole parental duty.", "Except people use the word in other ways. Dictionaries describe how language is used they don't prescribe it, and they lag behind. Words and meanings are added only after they're commonly used.", "Then if she appreciates him so much why is she hung up on something so petty. She should be grateful she's with a man who can provide to the point Tha she doesn't need to work amd is still able to put in work at home with parenting. You do realise that's a luxury these days right? She didn't say decent, decent is average, this fellow as described is far more than decent.", "No, he isn't doing her a favor but the language he is using says he is doing her a favor. That's the entire issue dude", "No, they will infer that your partner usually has sole parental duties and that you're only watching the kids because your partner isn't available, and if the partner was available she would be the one watching the kids by default.", "So than a baby sitter just sits on babies.  I babysit my nieces and nephews and have yet to sit on them. But I do parent them.  He\u2019s right mountain out of molehill for what little difference it is since my sister s or little kids don\u2019t call me their parent", "Do you speak English?", "Yes I do and that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying babysitting is literally parenting and parenting can sometimes be babysitting. They are the same fucking word said differently."]}
