This is what makes YTA, in my opinion.\n\nBefore that comment I would have suggested the two of you have a talk about her not asking baity questions and you just supporting and reassuring her when she's feeling insecure. \n\nFor example my bf and I worked it out so I just go \"say something nice about me\" when I'm feeling insecure and he can oblige and reassure me without having to feel trapped in some dumb testing question. \n\nI think it might take a bit more effort now, given the extra comments, but I hope you apologise for the childbirth comment and manage to make your wife feel beautiful again and the two of you can reach an understanding where she only asks for the truth when she genuinely wants it, and asks for support when she wants that.", "Absolutely, YTA.

Even if your wife is the most secure, chill person in the world, throwing in the extra comment about her sis not having kids fully implies that now that your wife has experienced childbirth, she\u2019s never gonna compare to a woman who hasn\u2019t. There\u2019s literally NOTHING your wife can do about the fact that she\u2019s already given birth, and now she gets to think about your shitty comment whenever she doubts her own beauty.

This might be the first time you confirmed something she has done internally. Things she might have been self-conscious about you never commented on or took notice of. Thus she might have accepted you appreciated her for how she is no matter what.\n\nThe having kids comment was uncalled for and completely disrespectful of your wife. You need to apologize for it. She needed to prepare for the answer she could have gotten and she needs to apologize for the lashing out she did.\n\n**Pro-tip:** Next time say yes, the sister wore it better only because all you could think about was your own wedding.

But then I'm to a point in my life where I can give myself my own validation and reassurance, and don't need to get it from other people. Many people aren't at that point yet, they're insecure, and they need to get validation and reassurance from others.\n\nYour wife was TA for asking \"Who wears it better?\" because there was only one answer she was willing to accept -- and you weren't clued-in enough to understand that.\n\nYou are a Double TA because how could you not see that there was only one acceptable answer?

Mentioning her having kids was unnecessary and took your comment way beyond honest to deliberately hurtful. It's a classic case of adding insult to injury.\n\nIf you really insist on being honest, you could have at least said something kind about your wife to make sure she knows that even though your SIL wore the dress better, everything about your wife as a whole package makes her the woman you love. \n\n\"She may have wore the dress better, but she's got nothing on your - insert complimentary trait here - !\", followed by a sitcom dip and kiss and your whole life could have been different."]}
