My sister and I have always been close, but recently she crossed a line that has me questioning our entire relationship.\n\nSo, I (28F) am getting married to my amazing fianc\u00e9 (30M) in a few months. We've been together for five years, and we're both very excited about the big day. My fianc\u00e9 is a confident, stylish guy, and I absolutely adore everything about him, including his unique long hair, which he's had since we first met.\n\nLast week, my sister (31F) visited us, and that's when things went south. She took one look at my fianc\u00e9's long hair and immediately started making snide remarks. She claimed his hair was \"messy\" and \"unprofessional,\" and that he should get a proper haircut before the wedding. I was shocked and tried to brush it off, thinking she was just being overly opinionated.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. Over the course of her visit, she kept bringing up the haircut issue, even suggesting she could book an appointment for him at her favorite salon. I was getting increasingly frustrated, but I didn't want to make a scene.\n\nYesterday, my fianc\u00e9 pulled me aside and confessed that my sister had approached him privately, urging him to cut his hair \"for my sake\" and to \"look more presentable.\" He was hurt by her comments but didn't want to create tension within the family.\n\nEnough was enough. I confronted my sister, expressing my disappointment and asking her to stop interfering with our relationship and my fianc\u00e9's appearance choices. She became defensive and argued that she was just trying to help me \"improve\" the wedding.\n\nUnable to tolerate her behavior any longer, I made the difficult decision to uninvite her from the wedding. She was taken aback, claiming I was overreacting and that I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister.\n\nNow, I feel guilty for potentially causing a rift in our family, but I also stand by my decision to protect my fianc\u00e9's feelings and our relationship. I don't want any negativity on our special day, but I'm torn about whether I made the right call. So, Reddit, AITA for uninviting my sister from my wedding?", "created_utc": 1690734672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dptkp/aita_for_uninviting_my_sister_from_my_wedding/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.  Your sister is going too far.  That is YOUR fiance... not hers.  She has zero say-so in his appearance.", "Cringe family", "Your fianc\u00e9 is NTA.  \nYou waited too long to address this with your sister and your sister waaaaay overstepped.  Both of you are wrong.  Sister being uninvited is correct.  She repeatedly harassed your fianc\u00e9 over his appearance. Not okay! His comfort on his wedding day is paramount so good for you making that call.  You need to stand strong and not bend. NTA but only if you continue to 100% support him.", "ESH. Choosing your fiance over your sister is completely reasonable, and in this case your sister is most definitely TA, but uninviting her was a slight overstep. Maybe call and talk to her? Try to sort things out privately before the rift is formed.", "NTA. Her behavior was incredibly out of line and she had the nerve to double down when you called her on it.\n\nBut just because you uninvited her doesn't mean she has to *stay* uninvited.\n\nYou can (and probably should, if only to avoid a family rift over taking an action that is impossible to take back later) give her an opportunity to earn back her invitation.\n\nI'd probably say something like, \"I want to give you an opportunity to fix things. If you apologize to my fianc\u00e9 and me for insulting his appearance and for disregarding our stylistic preferences for *our* wedding day *and* you agree to drop the issue permanently, then we would be happy to re-invite you to the wedding.\"\n\nThat way, if she declines to behave like a grown-up, you can explain to interested family members that the ball is in her court and it's entirely up to her whether she comes to your wedding. You also can point out that you are doing her a favor: if she's so upset by your fianc\u00e9's appearance that she is unable to control herself, then surely she'd find your wedding upsetting and quite possibly make a fool of herself by acting like a sisterzilla at your wedding", "YTA for not pulling your sister aside from the first comments and telling her to stop it. You shouldn\u2019t have let her go on that long bashing your fianc\u00e9s style. \nYou\u2019re NTA for uninviting her. She definitely needs to apologize to your fianc\u00e9 before you even consider reinviting her.", "NTA. \n\n>that I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister.\n\nThat's what is supposed to happen when you marry.

I\u2019d have said, if you don\u2019t drop it or say this again then you\u2019re uninvited. \n\nAs this will cause a big rift between you if she doesn\u2019t go. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA. But I urge you to be cautious about wedging a gap between you two. \n\nShe was awful, undeniably. And maybe there are other things at play? But I hope you two can resolve this (ie her apologise, and back tfo and you invite her)", "NTA, but, you took it too far. I understand you wanting to protect your fianc\u00e9, and that\u2019s a great thing. But uninviting your sister, whom you are close with, is a life altering decision that you can\u2019t undo. There will always be a rift between you and your sister if she doesn\u2019t go to your wedding. Seems like you two have to sit down and have a talk about boundaries regarding her and your future husband.  If she thinks there is an issue with him, she should come to you to discuss. I hope you are able to sort this out before the wedding!", "NTA, your sister should in no way shape or form day anything about someone else's hair, especially when her opinion was never asked. Your sister sounds like a control freak. I personally am LC with family for being less intrusive than that. Ultimately, this is your wedding OP, and it's your choice who's going to be there. If your sister can't read the room, it is her fault.", "ESH. Your sister should leave your fianc\u00e9 alone.

You were wrong not to deal with her firmly after the first comment.", "ESH. Your sister, obviously, because it's none of her business. But you are too, your communication skills are terrible. She is your sister, she is making your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable, you choose to say nothing -why??- and then in the end you uninvite her. Have you thought of actually talking to her, as she is apparently someone you are close to?!", "NTA obviously.\n\nBut I want to highlight a sentence that bothered me:\n\n\u201cShe claimed I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister\u201d\n\nYes, what\u2019s wrong with that? That\u2019s what you are supposed to do. If she can\u2019t understand no future relationship with her is possible", "Nta. Of course you were choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her. That's why you're marrying him. She can find her own long-haired fianc\u00e9 so she can cut his hair for their wedding. Until then, well, she'll have to be happy with the photos from yours.", ">that I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister.\n\nWell, yeah. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. If it were the other way around, you'd have no business getting married.\n\nYou're entirely justified to keep her out when she refused to stop meddling about something that's strictly none of her business. Especially if she was pushing so hard for something neither the bride nor the groom wanted.", "NTA your sister had no right to go behind your back and tell your husband to 'do it for her sake' you told her you didn't want/need him to cut his hair and yet she tried to be manipulative in telling him it was you who suggested it. \n\nalso YTA as you should have called your sister out for her actions in the first instance. Leaving it to escalate wasn't smart. Sometimes you gotta cause conflict to avoid the uninvited to the wedding situation. \n\nGive her an ultimatum if she breaks it then uninvite her. Granted this could just be the beginning and she could interfere with more things down the line, but cross those bridges with more maturity at the time they happen.", "NTA. I think you acted appropriately, given her abhorrent behaviour towards your fianc\u00e9.\n\nYour or your fianc\u00e9's appearance on your wedding day (or any other day of the year) has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else.", "ESH - You are overreacting by uninviting her to your  wedding. Especially after not telling her how much her actions were pissing u off to begin with. Tell her to stop and you don\u2019t want to discuss the issue anymore. Then, keep it moving.\n\nEDIT: What I mean above is that your sister\u2019s behavior has been bothering you for awhile and it sounds like you didn\u2019t tell her at first. So, the anger just built on itself. When you finally let her know, and she didn\u2019t immediately react the way you wanted her to, you went to the extreme option of uninviting her.

Kind of a \u201cstitch in time saves nine\u201d situation (if you get a rip in say clothing stitching it now will save it from ripping even more later and saving you nine more stitches to fix it so you\u2019re saving on both effort to fix and also damage done to the clothing).  \n\nBest to address these types of issues while small and as close to when they happen as is reasonable.  You don\u2019t risk anymore tension than you would if you delay it too long and if anything you\u2019re making sure it doesn\u2019t escalate and grow tension.  Esp true of major issues that frequently repeat.  \n\nIt\u2019s def a skill particularly to do it with as little tension as possible but it is one anyone can learn to be competent in given practice and bonus it is applicable to so many situations and all parts of your life.\n\nWhen in doubt pulling someone aside in private to give the behavior correction will minimize embarrassment and make it more likely to be better received.  Afterwards you can correct repeated offenses indirectly in the moment \u201chey sis we talked about this before\u201d or \u201csis please stop\u201d without drawing too much attention or potential embarrassment.\n\nEdited to add:  \n\nI\u2019m sorry if it was mentioned and I missed it (lack of sleep) but is it possible your sister is jealous of you?  Is she still unmarried or divorced?  Perhaps she enjoys being the only one married if she is married?  It just seems odd to me that she\u2019s making such a big deal about something that isn\u2019t about her.  \n\nI like to remind people who overstep like this (and that sometimes includes myself)\u201d X matter is not about them\u201d. Another version is \u201cnot everything is about you\u201d I remind them that \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I/we didn\u2019t ask for your opinion.\u201d And also \u201csome opinions/thoughts are inside ones and not ones you say/share.\u201d", "I didn\u2019t explain it well. I\u2019ll edit. It kind sounds like OP held it in for so long that when she finally said something she went to the extreme.", "YOUR sister is the ONLY architect of this mess. She chose to not shut up and mind her own friggin\u2019 business.  You absolutely made the right decision."]}
