My sister and I have always been close, but recently she crossed a line that has me questioning our entire relationship.\n\nSo, I (28F) am getting married to my amazing fianc\u00e9 (30M) in a few months. We've been together for five years, and we're both very excited about the big day. My fianc\u00e9 is a confident, stylish guy, and I absolutely adore everything about him, including his unique long hair, which he's had since we first met.\n\nLast week, my sister (31F) visited us, and that's when things went south. She took one look at my fianc\u00e9's long hair and immediately started making snide remarks. She claimed his hair was \"messy\" and \"unprofessional,\" and that he should get a proper haircut before the wedding. I was shocked and tried to brush it off, thinking she was just being overly opinionated.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. Over the course of her visit, she kept bringing up the haircut issue, even suggesting she could book an appointment for him at her favorite salon. I was getting increasingly frustrated, but I didn't want to make a scene.\n\nYesterday, my fianc\u00e9 pulled me aside and confessed that my sister had approached him privately, urging him to cut his hair \"for my sake\" and to \"look more presentable.\" He was hurt by her comments but didn't want to create tension within the family.\n\nEnough was enough. I confronted my sister, expressing my disappointment and asking her to stop interfering with our relationship and my fianc\u00e9's appearance choices. She became defensive and argued that she was just trying to help me \"improve\" the wedding.\n\nUnable to tolerate her behavior any longer, I made the difficult decision to uninvite her from the wedding. She was taken aback, claiming I was overreacting and that I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister.\n\nNow, I feel guilty for potentially causing a rift in our family, but I also stand by my decision to protect my fianc\u00e9's feelings and our relationship. I don't want any negativity on our special day, but I'm torn about whether I made the right call. So, Reddit, AITA for uninviting my sister from my wedding?", "created_utc": 1690734672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dptkp/aita_for_uninviting_my_sister_from_my_wedding/", "score": 565, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.  Your sister is going too far.  That is YOUR fiance... not hers.  She has zero say-so in his appearance.", "Cringe family", "Your fianc\u00e9 is NTA.  \nYou waited too long to address this with your sister and your sister waaaaay overstepped.  Both of you are wrong.  Sister being uninvited is correct.  She repeatedly harassed your fianc\u00e9 over his appearance. Not okay! His comfort on his wedding day is paramount so good for you making that call.  You need to stand strong and not bend. NTA but only if you continue to 100% support him.", "ESH. Choosing your fiance over your sister is completely reasonable, and in this case your sister is most definitely TA, but uninviting her was a slight overstep. Maybe call and talk to her? Try to sort things out privately before the rift is formed.", "NTA. Her behavior was incredibly out of line and she had the nerve to double down when you called her on it.\n\nBut just because you uninvited her doesn't mean she has to *stay* uninvited.\n\nYou can (and probably should, if only to avoid a family rift over taking an action that is impossible to take back later) give her an opportunity to earn back her invitation.\n\nI'd probably say something like, \"I want to give you an opportunity to fix things. If you apologize to my fianc\u00e9 and me for insulting his appearance and for disregarding our stylistic preferences for *our* wedding day *and* you agree to drop the issue permanently, then we would be happy to re-invite you to the wedding.\"\n\nThat way, if she declines to behave like a grown-up, you can explain to interested family members that the ball is in her court and it's entirely up to her whether she comes to your wedding. You also can point out that you are doing her a favor: if she's so upset by your fianc\u00e9's appearance that she is unable to control herself, then surely she'd find your wedding upsetting and quite possibly make a fool of herself by acting like a sisterzilla at your wedding", "YTA for not pulling your sister aside from the first comments and telling her to stop it. You shouldn\u2019t have let her go on that long bashing your fianc\u00e9s style. \nYou\u2019re NTA for uninviting her. She definitely needs to apologize to your fianc\u00e9 before you even consider reinviting her.", "NTA. \n\n>that I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister.\n\nThat's what is supposed to happen when you marry. You make vows that you will be putting your spouse first, before other family.", "NTA.

I\u2019d have said, if you don\u2019t drop it or say this again then you\u2019re uninvited. \n\nAs this will cause a big rift between you if she doesn\u2019t go. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA. But I urge you to be cautious about wedging a gap between you two. \n\nShe was awful, undeniably. And maybe there are other things at play? But I hope you two can resolve this (ie her apologise, and back tfo and you invite her)", "NTA, but, you took it too far. I understand you wanting to protect your fianc\u00e9, and that\u2019s a great thing. But uninviting your sister, whom you are close with, is a life altering decision that you can\u2019t undo. There will always be a rift between you and your sister if she doesn\u2019t go to your wedding. Seems like you two have to sit down and have a talk about boundaries regarding her and your future husband.  If she thinks there is an issue with him, she should come to you to discuss. I hope you are able to sort this out before the wedding!", "NTA, your sister should in no way shape or form say anything about someone else's hair, especially when her opinion was never asked. Your sister sounds like a control freak. I personally am LC with family for being less intrusive than that. Ultimately, this is your wedding OP, and it's your choice who's going to be there. If your sister can't read the room, it is her fault.", "ESH. Your sister should leave your fianc\u00e9 alone.

You were wrong not to deal with her firmly after the first comment.", "ESH. Your sister, obviously, because it's none of her business. But you are too, your communication skills are terrible. She is your sister, she is making your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable, you choose to say nothing -why??- and then in the end you uninvite her. Have you thought of actually talking to her, as she is apparently someone you are close to?!", "NTA obviously.\n\nBut I want to highlight a sentence that bothered me:\n\n\u201cShe claimed I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister\u201d\n\nYes, what\u2019s wrong with that? That\u2019s what you are supposed to do. If she can\u2019t understand no future relationship with her is possible", "Nta. Of course you were choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her. That's why you're marrying him. She can find her own long-haired fianc\u00e9 so she can cut his hair for their wedding. Until then, well, she'll have to be happy with the photos from yours.", ">that I was choosing my fianc\u00e9 over my own sister.\n\nWell, yeah. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. If it were the other way around, you'd have no business getting married.\n\nYou're entirely justified to keep her out when she refused to stop meddling about something that's strictly none of her business. Especially if she was pushing so hard for something neither the bride nor the groom wanted.", "NTA your sister had no right to go behind your back and tell your husband to 'do it for her sake' you told her you didn't want/need him to cut his hair and yet she tried to be manipulative in telling him it was you who suggested it. \n\nalso YTA as you should have called your sister out for her actions in the first instance. Leaving it to escalate wasn't smart. Sometimes you gotta cause conflict to avoid the uninvited to the wedding situation. \n\nGive her an ultimatum if she breaks it then uninvite her. Granted this could just be the beginning and she could interfere with more things down the line, but cross those bridges with more maturity at the time they happen.", "NTA. I think you acted appropriately, given her abhorrent behaviour towards your fianc\u00e9.\n\nYour or your fianc\u00e9's appearance on your wedding day (or any other day of the year) has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else.", "ESH - You are overreacting by uninviting her to your  wedding. Especially after not telling her how much her actions were pissing u off to begin with. Tell her to stop and you don\u2019t want to discuss the issue anymore. Then, keep it moving.\n\nEDIT: What I mean above is that your sister\u2019s behavior has been bothering you for awhile and it sounds like you didn\u2019t tell her at first. So, the anger just built on itself. When you finally let her know, and she didn\u2019t immediately react the way you wanted her to, you went to the extreme option of uninviting her.

Like, if your sister's in the hospital, and your husband wants to watch SUITS, you go visit your sister in the hospital.\n\nThe funny part here is that the impact on your husband is greater than the impact on your sister - she has to deal with looking at your husband's hair that she doesn't like... your husband has to cut off his own hair.\n\nSo, not only does (in a vacuum) fiance outweigh sister, 'having hair cut' outweighs 'having to look at hair I don't like.'\n\nWhether uninviting is the right approach, idk - maybe an ultimatum 'either you stop talking about my husband's hair or you can't come to the wedding.'", "ESH \n\nYou suck for even allowing your sister to say more than one thing about your fiance hair.

Kind of a \u201cstitch in time saves nine\u201d situation (if you get a rip in say clothing stitching it now will save it from ripping even more later and saving you nine more stitches to fix it so you\u2019re saving on both effort to fix and also damage done to the clothing).  \n\nBest to address these types of issues while small and as close to when they happen as is reasonable.  You don\u2019t risk anymore tension than you would if you delay it too long and if anything you\u2019re making sure it doesn\u2019t escalate and grow tension.  Esp true of major issues that frequently repeat.  \n\nIt\u2019s def a skill particularly to do it with as little tension as possible but it is one anyone can learn to be competent in given practice and bonus it is applicable to so many situations and all parts of your life.\n\nWhen in doubt pulling someone aside in private to give the behavior correction will minimize embarrassment and make it more likely to be better received.  Afterwards you can correct repeated offenses indirectly in the moment \u201chey sis we talked about this before\u201d or \u201csis please stop\u201d without drawing too much attention or potential embarrassment.\n\nEdited to add:  \n\nI\u2019m sorry if it was mentioned and I missed it (lack of sleep) but is it possible your sister is jealous of you?  Is she still unmarried or divorced?  Perhaps she enjoys being the only one married if she is married?  It just seems odd to me that she\u2019s making such a big deal about something that isn\u2019t about her.  \n\nI like to remind people who overstep like this (and that sometimes includes myself)\u201d X matter is not about them\u201d. Another version is \u201cnot everything is about you\u201d I remind them that \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I/we didn\u2019t ask for your opinion.\u201d And also \u201csome opinions/thoughts are inside ones and not ones you say/share.\u201d", "I didn\u2019t explain it well. I\u2019ll edit. It kind sounds like OP held it in for so long that when she finally said something she went to the extreme.", "YOUR sister is the ONLY architect of this mess. She chose to not shut up and mind her own friggin\u2019 business.  You absolutely made the right decision.", "Your sister is a giant AH. People are entitled to look the way they want to look. There is nothing wrong with men having long hair.. I understand losing it and going off on her, I would have done the same. Just because ppl are related to you doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t shitty :/ NTA", "I can't believe people are getting upset with OP for choosing the OTHER PERSON WHOSE WEDDING IT IS over her sister. Maybe she could've been nicer about it and told her to drop it first but the people getting married are top priority in the wedding", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"my husband is a nice person and like to help\" .. YOu ALWAYS should do that.", "Nta. But I would have given warning before going nuclear, say \"we both like his appearance, if you don't like it, then you don't have to come to the wedding, the choice is yours, but any more snide remarks, and your invite will be rescinded\" but she was bullying him and you defended him.", "NTA. She said she wanted to improve the wedding, and that's what you did by uninviting her.", "NTA at all.  Your sister brought this upon herself with her entitled behavior.", "ESH. She was out of line but I think you're over reacting because you uninvited her in the middle of the first conversation you had with her about it. I would have given her at least one opportunity to change her behaviour before saying she wasn't welcome. If she didn't stop then sure cut her off. Who knows, she might have stopped sooner if youd spoken to her about it earlier.", "YTA.\n\nI think she was out of line with her comments, but I think an explosion and a threat of uninviting would have been enough. You overreacted. \n\nYou could talk to her, see if she is remorseful. This seems like a silly reason to break relations between sisters. But be sure to tell her, when talking to her, that of course you choose your fiance over her. Tell her that is not something you never want to hear again because it will not change.", "YTA\n\nFamily is family. Anything for family\u2026", "NTA. But that doesn\u2019t mean I agree with uninviting her. Do you really want to die on this hill?\n\nInstead, sit down with her and have a hard discussion about meddling in your life. I would approach it from a position of strength but not superiority. Your sister is immature and you\u2019re so plainly not. And of course, you\u2019re operating from a position of strength b/c you\u2019ve got everything to look forward to. Congratulations on finding a great partner! \n\nNow in your conversation you do need to make clear that she can\u2019t be trying to take over your life and decisions. If she can\u2019t live with that \u2014 putting the onus on *her* here \u2014 then sure, she\u2019s uninvited AND your relationship will be forever much different than it has been. \n\nI say all of this with 69 years of perspective. Of course, it\u2019s your choice if you\u2019d rather have this relationship changed to much less than it has been. \n\nI also say this because by sitting down with her and putting the onus in her you\u2019re operating from a position of strength. You\u2019re taking control back and you\u2019re giving *her* the opportunity to decide.", "NTA.  She kept at it and she had to face consequences. Would I have gone as fair as uninviting her?  Probably not.  But you've got your reasons.\n\nThough, I'd try and find out why she's hyper fixated on your fiance's hair.  There has to be something she isn't telling you about.  Could be a crush on your fiance, or she's projecting something.  Maybe trauma or a failed relationship?  It has to be something.", "NTA\n\nOP's sister: \" how dare you uninviting me when I just try to make your husband try to change his appearance to my liking despite how him or OP feels? I only nagged and made remarks all the time, how dare you OP choose him over meeEEeeEeee!\"\n\nOP you tried and was a good sister trying to shut that shit down. Your sister on the other hand was being everything other than that...", "NTA", "NTA, well done.", "NTA. It's yours and your fiance's wedding, not your sister's. You both deserve to be comfortable and enjoy the day, and it sounds like she will make sure neither of you do", "NTA, the audacity your sister has is baffling. her behaviour was so over the limit and you made the right decision of uninviting her.", "Just give her the chop...cut her out of your life.. snip it...I could go on....", "NTA. You can tell your sister you're glad she understands completely, you ARE choosing your fianc\u00e9 over her. It's kind of the whole point of marriage.", "NTA.\n\nIt WASN'T you who caused the rift.\n\nSHE is trying to force \\*your\\* fianc\u00e9 to change because SHE is uncomfortable.\n\nShe can go fuck herself with a buzz cutter and suffer through it.", "If you don't pick your spouse over your family, then you probably shouldn't get married at all. But NTA. Everyone seems to have a way they think other's weddings should go. Ideas are nice, but none need to be taken. No one should be guaranteed an invite if they are being disrespectful.", "Your sister did end up improving your wedding!  By being removed from it.", "NTA. I do think uninviting her is an overreaction, but I don't think your TA. Does that make sense?", "NTA ... and the whole point of a wedding IS to choose your SO ober your bio fam...\n\nTell her to shut the hell up and one more word and she will be gone...", "Why is she so invested in his hair? Like it\u2019s not her wedding. He\u2019s not her partner. If she prefers men with short hair that\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s not her concern. \n\nMaybe asking once, \u201care you cutting your hair for the wedding?\u201d Is fine, but after you & he said \u201cno\u201d, there was no reason to push it further. \n\nNTA. It\u2019s a real shame it had to come to this but she was actually making the groom to be uncomfortable so why should she be allowed at his & your wedding. She has to realize it\u2019s his wedding to. \n\nAnd even tho you are 100% NTA, I would give her an opportunity to sincerely apologize to both of you & reinstate her invite on the condition she keeps her mouth shut. This includes no whining to others about his hair, any aspect of yours or his appearance, or any aspect of the wedding to you or other people or she\u2019ll be disinvited permanently.", "NTA, you improved your wedding!", "NTA but anyone else think the older sister is probably acting out because shes the older sister and not the center of attention right now? My sister was totally like this around my wedding", "I wouldn\u2019t let him fall asleep anywhere near her either - she seems the type to \u201cgive him a nice haircut\u201d.", "Definitely NTA, can\u2019t complain about his hair if she\u2019s not there to see it!!!", "NTA , OP. It's good to have ties with family, but not when they're shitty. Good for you having a shiny spine and standing up for your fianc\u00e9. It bodes well for your relationship that the two of you already communicate with each other openly.", "You are not wrong, but I would have phrased it as \u201cif his appearance offends you so much, then feel free to skip the wedding.  I however love him and his hair and wouldn\u2019t change anything. \u201c\n\nYou can always tell her in a week or two that if she wants to attend to wish you both well and stop being critical in the name of making your wedding \u201cbetter\u201d she is welcome to come.   If she can\u2019t keep her thoughts and options to herself, she will probably be happier staying away.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!    I hope it is everything you hope for", "NTA he\u2019s your partner your supposed to choose him over others even your own family", "NTA OP.  Had I been in your shoes, I\u2019d have started thinking out loud about the possibility of how cute your sister would look with Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s all-but-bald haircut, and speculating about taking her to a salon to have it all cut off.  Petty, I know, but it would get her to shut her pie hole.", "YTA. Sounds like you didn't say anything regarding the comments until you blew up. That's on you.", "You made the right call. Your sister caused this. It\u2019s HER fault, not yours. Proud of you for standing up for your fianc\u00e9. I wish you both a happily-ever-after.", "NTA. You asked her to stop, you told her to stop, she refused.  She lost the right to attend your wedding. \n\nAND your fiance is the one you are choosing.

It is not her wedding.", "Men with long hair look gross", "Info: how long between when you told her to back off and when you uninvited her?
