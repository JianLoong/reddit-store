She had a really hard life, doesn\u2019t have much affection left to give and she rarely gets close to anyone. It\u2019s pure disinterest and she can\u2019t bring herself to care about new people. She\u2019s a retired old lady that just want to sit on the porch not make small talk with people. I\u2019ve explained this to my wife before and told my mothers story.\n\nWe had a little get together at my moms house. My mom doesn\u2019t like it when people bring food, she works all day to make a spread and it\u2019s like her thing. She just wants to provide for the guests. My wife came from work and she brought food, potatoes salad. I stop her from bringing it in, the whole night she is just bothering her when she was on the porch. Asking her if she wants to go on a shopping trip, when my mom asks for some quiet she still talks on. When I was walking by she asked me to take my wife away from her. This made my wife upset but I did it since I could see mom was getting close to the end of her rope.\n\nWe had a talk in the care what that was all about, and she just wants to be loved by her MIL.  She is being nice so she doesn\u2019t get why she doesn\u2019t like her. I told her my mother will never love her and to just stop. What she is doing is actively making her dislike you and to leave the women alone. She called me a jerk and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since.\n\nEdit was told to include this comment, from an info comment\n\nAlmost never, most of the time if people join her on the porch it\u2019s very littler small talk or just join her watching the garden. She doesn\u2019t care how loud they are in the house or anything like that. She likes watching others have a good time, more of an observer than anything\n\nShe asked for quiet with my wife since she was just going on for a while. My sister was out there and told me mom tried politer ways to ask for her to be quiet and it didn\u2019t work.

Your mom is justified in wanting a little peace out of life. You are respectful to leave your mom to enjoy the life she wants. Your wife sounds like a people-pleaser who doesn't understand that MIL doesn't need someone to please her; MIL just wants to relax in peace. It was, however, a bit harsh to say MIL will never love you wife. You could have picked better wording there. Something like \"Mom is an introvert. She just wants peace and quiet. She is not lonely or sad. She is just quiet. Too much noise or stimulation is upsetting. Please just leave her be.\"", "I like old people like your mom. Would love to sit quietly in the garden with her. I can't stand it when people talk too much around me when I want peace. Also have a thing where I don't like people who try too hard. Your mom is so relatable. I don't think you're an a*shole.

Hopefully you understand where she is coming from and help her understand not everyone will appreciate her.", "NTA, but there may be a better way to handle this. Your wife wants her MIL to love her, and your mom just doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth. Maybe you haven\u2019t communicated to your wife that her approach is having the opposite effect. Telling your wife that your mom will never love her isn\u2019t helpful. It might be true, but it\u2019s unhelpful.\nYour mom needs quiet and your wife is taking that from her. Your mom shows her love for her family by cooking for them, and your wife bringing food says to your mom that her food isn\u2019t good enough.\nYour wife is undermining herself because she can\u2019t or won\u2019t see past what she (your wife) would want instead of what your mom needs. They are both talking, and their messages are similar, but they aren\u2019t hearing each other.", "NTA.  Sounds like your wife is an extrovert and your mom is an introvert.  Your wife needs to try harder to understand that other people are not just like her and may have have different wants and needs.", "INFO:  Why does you mom ask people to come over and be quiet?  All the people or just your wife?", "Some people on this thread are being a little dense, IMO. So because Mom (who\u2019s had a hard life and just wants some peace and quiet) doesn\u2019t want to talk to her guests, she should just be left alone completely for the rest of her life? This is the way Mom can still participate in life and she clearly enjoys hanging out in quiet by herself or with others (who are also quiet, like the sister).\n\nI get sensory overwhelm from people who are constantly talking (which seems like OP\u2019s wife does\u2014well-intentioned, but still), and since OP (and Mom) have already made it clear she doesn\u2019t like to talk much, wife should easily respect that.\n\nThe only reason wife keeps breaking this boundary seems to be for her own personal gain of cultivating a relationship MIL doesn\u2019t want. OP edited that Mom did try to ask more gently (which she shouldn\u2019t even have to do because OP has made it abundantly clear to wife not to do all the things she continues to do).\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sometimes in life we just have to accept people for who they are and the actual bond we have with them, not aim for an idealised imaginary relationship. There's obviously exceptions for abuse or rudeness but it sounds like your mum is civil when not pushed beyond her boundaries.", "NTA. Considering you two are fully married I assume she isn\u2019t new to your mother\u2019s temperament. Your wife needs to be an adult and realise she cannot force the connection she wants with your mother.", "NTA. Your wife isn't being nice. Nice would be treating your mother they way your mother wants to be treated not the way your wife wants to treat her. \n\nI think saying \"love\" in the manner you did was probably not the most tactful way to say it but tact wasn't working.", "NTA. I don't think your wife has bad intentions at all, but she has to realize you can't force a relationship with someone, particularly when you're treating them the way you'd want to be treated rather than the way THEY want to be treated. If your mom were being actively disrespectful to your wife I would call you an AH for not standing up for her, but it sounds like your mom just wants to be left alone.", "NTA.. my husband's elderly aunt is exactly the same as OP's mom..in context my husband was raised mostly by her spinster aunt..she prefers being by herself reason why she never married. When, I first met her I tried to get her approval a lot. Made dinner for her, invited her to go out and such...she always had the same dismissive behavior with me so after a while, I gave up on it and after not trying anymore, we sort of got along better... I left her alone and she was happy! Sometimes, by not trying we get what we are aiming for I guess...", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like your mom has been rude at all, just apathetic. She didn\u2019t tell your wife to shut up, make you leave with her nor does it sound like she stops EVERYONE from interacting with *each other* while at her house. It sounds like your mom enjoys being around family and seeing you guys eat her food/fill her house, but she doesn\u2019t like all the actual socializing and trying to be outgoing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being introverted and still not wanting to be alone. \n\nIt seems like your wife has repeatedly disrespected your moms boundaries and comfort levels, and despite being asked politely to take it back a notch with only your mom, both by yourself and your mom, she still thinks her way of connecting is better rather than realizing there\u2019s different ways to connect with different people.", "NTA\nYour wife clearly has unrealistic expectations and is putting in effort that's making your mother more annoyed.", "NTA. Your wife is not respecting your mom\u2019s boundaries. Tell her if she really wants your mom to even like her, step one is respecting her requests for space and to not bring food over unasked for. Those are not unreasonable requests at all.", "NTA.  She can 'want to be loved by her MIL' until the cows come home, but MIL gets to determine that, not her.  And you're right, she's just making it worse.", "INFO: Who arranged this get together? Or any get togethers at her house for that matter?", "It's sad, but you told your wife about your mother's boundaries. Your wife should respect them. NTA.", "My first thought is that your mom is probably dealing with depression.\n\nYour wife has ideas about how to be pleasant and nice to others, but it doesn't sound like she's considering how your mother would want to be approached.\n\nSome people do just want to be left alone, though it can be a sign of depression. Impossible to know without her being evaluated. But it could also be that she's just particular.\n\nFor example, I like sitting quietly and enjoying a nice view with a cold beer or hot coffee. My kid is one of those there-can't-be-a-silent-moment people. I love him but we had to have a talk about how I love his company but if we're doing \"my thing\" he should be aware how I like things and when we do \"his thing\" I adopt his excitement and chatter, it's just meeting halfway and we both get to share something we enjoy.\n\nIt's possible your mother would be ok with your wife sitting down next to her on the porch with zero chatter, just sitting together.", "Your wife is TA. The old lady likes her peace and quiet and to not have her guests worry about things like bringing food. Your wife has been told this and still badgers her/ignores her wishes. She needs to get the message. Your mother isn't being rude, she's still hosting and providing food, just doesn't want bothering or to make small talk. No big deal.", "NTA\n\nYour mom wants to be left the hell alone.\n\nYour wife has an innate desire to be loved by her, and/or dote on her.\n\nOil and water don't mix.  Keep them apart as best you can.", "NTA.  It seems like your mom isn't mean, she is just apathetic in general.\n\nHow does your mom act around grandkids?  Is she disinterested in them as well?  How do you think she will treat your kids?", "NTA.  There\u2019s maybe a nicer way you could have said that to your wife, but your mom has made her boundaries clear.  Your wife might want a certain relationship, and she\u2019s entitled to want that, but she can\u2019t force it if your mom doesn\u2019t want the same relationship with her.\n\nThe fact that your mom has to say \u201cplease make her stop talking to me\u201d says that your wife is overstepping established boundaries and not respecting your mom\u2019s wishes.\n\nMaybe think more about your phrasing in the future, but I still say NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mother has clearly communicated her boundaries. You have clearly communicated your mother\u2019s boundaries. Your wife continues to ignore your mother\u2019s boundaries. \n\nDoes your wife understand consent? Does she understand that no means no? Does she understand that other people\u2019s feelings and desires are every bit as valid as her own?", "I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole here, you\u2019re right but your wife only has good intentions even if they\u2019re misplaced", "NTA.\n\nSometimes people need to hear, and come to accept, the truth.\n\nYour wife has to now accept her feelings are secondary to your mother\u2019s boundaries in this case.", "NTA - People who beg me for attention won\u2019t have good results either.", "NTA, I think your phrasing was a little unkind, but your wife seems to be creating issues where there are none .\n\nWhy does your wife want so much attention? She seems desperate to get some sort of reaction out of your mother, but why can't she accept that love can be present without constantly looking at or talking to?", "Soft YTA. Your mother in law cooked a feast for you and her. That\u2019s her way of showing love. That\u2019s what you should have said instead of saying the love is not there.", "NTA but if your mother acts like that, why even bring your wife around her?", "Nobody is obligated to care about another person. If she doesn't want to make an effort, your wife needs to stop. I know that myself, I would reach the end of my rope and say things that won't be nice to get my point across.\n\nIt sounds like your mom is getting close to that. We teach children that not everyone wants to be their friend - I guess your wife missed that lesson. Be prepared for the blow out\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nSounds like you\u2019ve tried to explain your mom what she wants from people and why she is who she is .\n\nYour wife\u2019s not going to change that, especially by being pushy. I understand she\u2019s disappointed, but this is not the way.\n\nI feel like as we age in someways we return to acting like small children. And we all know what every child does with the grandma that rushes to pick them up and doesn\u2019t let the child get used to a new environment or a new relationship - they scream and cry.\n\nYour wife is acting the exact same way. And your mom is acting out as a result.", "NTA. Your wife sounds exhausting and I wonder if she isn\u2019t making things worse on purpose. Point out to her that if she wants to bond with your mom there are better ways, like sitting quietly with her looking at the garden.

Gotta meet mom where she is but Jesus Christ I feel for your wife. \u201cStop being so nice, my mom will just hate you more\u201d is a tough one to swallow.

Why bring your wife around when your mother \u201cwon\u2019t ever love her\u201d? Your wife should just ignore her and leave her alone but you set her up to fail. You\u2019re literally telling your wife \u201cstop being so nice and trying to have a relationship with my mum. She will never love you\u201d is absolutely heartbreaking. I get she had a tough life but being cold towards family members, never wanting to talk or get to know your wife, makes her an asshole. It is disrespectful to have complete disinterest in guests you have invited to your house. \n\nGo and see your mother on your own. Stop bringing people around her that she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with. **Alls you\u2019re doing is hurting your wife, your marriage and your mother.** If your mother questions why she\u2019s not there anymore then you can explain that she was clearly uncomfortable around your wife and would not be quiet, so you told her that she will never love her and to stop trying.", "ESH. I don't understand why MIL who doesn't like people around, doesn't really want to talk to them, and seems to be content on her own - invites people over at all? And then doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that they are there? And, why you keep going, and still, take your wife when you know they don't gel and she'll be treated poorly? Why does your wife attend and seem to push for a relationship that you've told her isn't going to happen, other than \"that how it should be?\" \n\nI think you should visit your mom on your own, and if your wife is looking for a \"mom figure,\" plan to find elsewhere. Your \"family\" is who you make it. I had neighbors when I was in my 30s/40's that were almost like 2nd parents. Lol, concerned if I got home \"late,\" when they were old, asked me to watch the sickest while the other went to church, etc. Met a lady bowling that ended up being like a grandmother. Those relationships were organic, not forced. Hopefully your wife will be able to find something similar to offset the ostracism from your mom.", "ESH. Your mother doesn't have to like your wife but being old and having had a hard life doesn't entitle her to be rude to your wife. Asking for \"quiet\", asking you to \"take your wife away from her\" right on your wife's face?! WTF. That's not alright. Your mother is an asshole. \n\nYou're an asshole for making excuses for her and for continuing to bring your wife around your mother and expecting her to put up with being treated with a complete lack of respect by her MIL. Your wife shouldn't be pushing for a relationship your mother doesn't want, but you shouldn't demand her accept being treated like a leper. \n\nYour wife is kind of an asshole, too, because she needs to understand she can't force people to like her or to be social with her if they don't want it. Your mother has made it clear (and in the rudest way possible) she is not willing to be friendly toward her; she needs to let it go mostly because she's the only one being hurt.\n\nThat said, upon reading your comments, I think there's a high chance your mother is in a deep state of depression and has been for a while (you mention her antisocial behavior got worse after your father's passing). She should get help.", "So when you have kids your wife and child won\u2019t be expected to engage with your mother since she has no more love to give right?

Go one way or the other. Your mom could at least show some basic respect to her especially when SHE is the host. \n\nIdk, maybe it\u2019s just a very different family dynamic from what I\u2019m used to but I feel like if I was in your wife\u2019s position I wouldn\u2019t feel very welcome.", "ESH. \n\nLiterally every last one of you is dreadful and needs a reminder about how to be a decent, thoughtful human being. Your mother included.\n\nYour wife is an AH because she doesn't actually care about GENUINELY bonding with your mother, she likes the IDEA of a \"close MIL/DIL relationship\". I know lots of women like her (and to be clear, this is not limited to women, but it's a trait that is often inculcated in women, to be \"sociable\" and \"outgoing\" even at the cost of being genuinely caring or empathetic): self-absorbed, and so caught up in the idea of how a particular relationship \"should\" work that they don't actually stop to listen to the other person, or respect their boundaries. They end up rubbing everyone the wrong way.\n\nYour wife, it seems, doesn't ask what your mother would like from her. Instead she storms into every get-together like the proverbial bull in the china shop, being exhausting and overbearing, offering \"help\" that your mother doesn't want and that may even read as offensive (e.g. bringing food when part of your mother's pride and joy is cooking and providing plentiful meals for her guests), and talking endlessly to a woman who is clearly an introvert who values her quiet time. \n\nYou are a MASSIVE AH for telling your wife that your mother \"will never love her\" when even you admit that's not necessarily true, if she would change her behaviour. What an unnecessarily cruel, disgusting thing to say. I can't think of anything you could possibly say to someone you are supposed to care about that is more clearly intended to be hurtful.\n\nYes, you are right to talk to your wife about how she interacts with your mother, to tell her that her behaviour is damaging the relationship, and to explain how she could improve their interactions. But just telling her, \"My mother will never love you,\" is an awful thing to say that serves no purpose except to hurt her.\n\nAnd your mother is an AH because, well, your description of her isn't actually a defense of her behaviour, it's just the definition of being an AH:\n\n>She had a really hard life, doesn\u2019t have much affection left to give and she rarely gets close to anyone. It\u2019s pure disinterest and she can\u2019t bring herself to care about new people.\n\nShe doesn't have to be best friends with anyone, but that doesn't give her licence to treat people like shit either. If she cannot be kind, or at least polite and reasonably friendly, she shouldn't be inviting people into her home. \"Pure disinterest\" in how you treat people is literally just a synonym for \"not giving a shit\" . . . or assholery. You are literally telling us that your mother is an asshole, and expecting us to . . . what?  Call her something else? No. She's a grown ass adult. If she treats people rudely, then she's an AH. Being old and tired is not an excuse for not having basic manners. And I say that as someone who is old and exhausted.\n\nESH. You all sound dreadful.", "NTA - Your wife needs to recognize that your Mother is who she is and itll be much easier.", "So... ESH.... your wife needs to take the hint sure....but im sorry your mom is being rude. If she just wants peace and quiet she needs to not have anyone over. She doesn't need to be besties with your wife... but why are you allowing your mom to be so cold.... sorry but its NOT normal to not interact with anyone who comes over...its really awkward and unwelcomming.

Bringing food to a food-bases gathering is basic etiquette. Your mom is being rude to your wife because she wants to control everything. She needs to be gracious or stop inviting you to food-bases gatherings, or maybe use her big girl words to actually talk to your wife and let her know her preference is to not have outside food at meals she hosts.\n\nYour wife doesn't get to crawl up her butt and ignore all her boundaries, either. Wife needs to back off, mom needs to step up and remove herself from situations she doesn't want to be in before she resorts to rudeness.\n\nYou need to stop excusing your mom's behavior.", "ESH \n\nYour mother for being unbelievably rude to people she has invited to her home.

What's with asking you to take your wife away? Did she ask her to go and mingle and your wife refused?\n\n**Your wife** has hit on a formula that is really, really not going to work if she's truly looking for a better relationship. I suspect she's decided that if she can just *make a connection* then it'll start healing all the years of difficulty and your mum will be a happy energetic extrovert!

Your mum can't change over 20 years as she gets some time to herself to recover? She can't grow fond of someone who isn't *new people* but a regular fixture? \ud83d\ude15\n\nI suspect you went off-track a little when you told your mother's life story as an explanation of why she's distant.

Sometimes there's something going haywire with their hormones or nervous system, and the proper treatment can provide a lot of relief in everyday life as well as social situations.

If your mom doesn't want to have company or entertain company, then she shouldn't be inviting people over. Period. If she wants a quiet and peaceful life, then the option here is to not host events where there are people who want to reasonably socialize. Having people over is an invitation to being okay with communication and being polite. Your mom is not being a good hostess by ignoring her guests. I don't care how old she is. If she doesn't have the bandwidth to talk, she doesn't have the bandwidth to host.\n\nYou all need a lesson on boundaries and self-awareness.\n\n1. Your wife: It's great she wants a good relationship with your mom. If your wife is being too involved, your mother is old enough to communicate she isn't in a talking mood. That said, once again, if your mom is hosting everyone, she is also accepting to a degree being amiable and being a good hostess and communicating with her DIL. Either your mom stops inviting her over or your wife should start hosting events if her social meter is higher. Since your wife was given adequate warning, I think it's fair to say E.S.H because she should have taken the hint and left her alone for a wee-bit. Honestly, it sounds like the event went past the time it should have so your mom can have some time to wind down. Take note of that and remove your wife and yourself around that time so your mom gets to recharge. Personally, I think bringing something is more of a polite thing - many households around the world you wouldn't consider showing up empty handed unless expressly told otherwise. Your wife will need to tame her expectations, and perhaps a therapist can help her navigate that.\n2. Your mom: She clearly doesn't have the capacity to be a good hostess to ALL of her guests. I am all for the isolated, semi-grumpy old granny life-style. But that goes out the window when you are hosting people. If she doesn't have the energy to be a good hostess, she shouldn't be having people over. Her telling you to fetch your wife like she's some annoying puppy was incredibly rude, no matter how annoying your wife was being. Once again, I think your mom shouldn't be hosting. She wants a isolated and quiet life, and her current actions are counter to that. Clearly your wife feels unwelcomed - and while her MIL may not be as bad as others, being less involved and treating her like a yappy mutt is not okay either. Your mother needs to muster up some level of affection for your wife, even if it is passively through a text, email, or heartfelt card for the sake of YOUR  marriage and family. It's not that hard, and if she cared about YOU as her child, she would make sure your wife wasn't feeling like she has to prove herself so much.  If she can't muster that, then your mother will need to accept you and your wife might not come around as much (Because, rightfully, you are both a package deal and it's otherwise rude to invite one partner but not the other).\n3. You: You should know well enough that your main support is your wife. You married her. If your mom isn't going to make a progressive effort to make sure your wife feels welcome in the family (and I think her excuse that she's old and therefore can't be bothered to get to know new people is unacceptable), then you need to find an alternative. That might mean you and your wife start hosting things, and giving your mom a proper means to leave if she wants to (or even not come if she doesn't want to). Saying your mother is incapable of showing your wife any level of affection is just beyond the pale. Your mother is capable - she is just choosing not to.", "NTA. My (33F) mom is like this too.

But instead of trying to accept that wife is trying to convert MIL to her preferred way of showing/receiving affection. This is kinda selfish imo.\n\nThe real solution to this is to stop raising people to be people pleasers. And stop labeling all silences as awkward. Silence is not always awkward, it's only awkward if you make it awkward. Sometimes enjoying some peaceful silence with loved ones is the best kind of bonding.

I \\*don't\\* make a point to insist on quiet when I have guests and am playing host.\n\nThis is a woman who presumably lives and spends most of her time alone, correct? And yet she can't just tune out her DIL for two hours after inviting her over?\n\nI'm also an introvert but I actually know what that word means unlike most of the people using it in this thread. It means that I need time to recharge after being social. Being social for me requires me to be \"on,\" so to speak. So I *do* actually understand needing quiet.\n\nNone of that changes the fact that if I invited guests into my house and then asked someone else to remove them from a common space because they had the audacity to speak to me, I would absolutely be the asshole in that scenario.", "I'm sorry she went through that. It sounds like your wife had an idea of what having a MIL would be like (maybe she has friends/family who are close to theirs?) and is sad that this hasn't materialized. I hope she finds a way to be okay with it. I don't know if your mom would be comfortable with this, but I used to sit on the porch with my grandma knitting or doing crosswords or reading magazines. I never forced her to talk, but sometimes she would ask questions about what I was doing and it would spark a conversation.", "My grandma was kind of like that too the last few years. She had been diagnosed with a terminal disease, told she had a year. She ended up living another 14 which was amazing but she was so tired. Always feeling sick and tired. Lost her husband and three siblings in 4 months. She had been preparing for a long time to pass, and instead buried the love of her life and her three remaining siblings. She still loved us, we knew that but she wasn't the same. She was always tired and being around people was exhausting. Just having us over to visit for a few hours would leave her exhausted for days. \n\nYour wife needs to realize that just inviting her over and feeding her IS an act of love from your mom. She is trading her peace for that, which means a lot when you're just done.", "\"I don't have it in me to be social so please don't come by today\" is a reasonable boundary.\n\n\"Do not speak to me while you're a guest in my house\" is not a reasonable boundary.", "If you don't want a relationship with them why invite them...thats rude and awkward.   Sorry im either part of the family or im not. Grandma shpuld just tell her son wife isnt welcome anymore... tell them how she really feels", "Then she needs to not have people over or only allow certain people over.", "She shouldn\u2019t be inviting the wife in the first place, then. But asking a man to control his wife in front of her is gross.", "She doesn't! Are you people even reading the same post?!?! She does not ignore people, she does not just sit there mute refusing to engage, she just likes to sit on her porch and enjoy her garden after a long day without constant small talk.", "It\u2019s not projecting, I just mentioned the similarities because everyone is assuming that the MIL was talking and chatting the whole dinner, when we don\u2019t know if it was like that or not. You also can\u2019t say that this situation is not like mine since theres no indicators of that too", "If you dont want to talk to anyone... dont have people over", "This right here. Jeez. I swear these people saying she shouldn\u2019t invite people over are dumb as hell", "So for wife to be part of that family wife shpuld just shut up and not feel included?", "When you have guests over....you dont just refuse to interact with them and act all cold....its okay to want to converse with YOUR OWN FAMILY.  If MIL really doesnt want small talk or anyone talking to her she needs to not have guests at all..", "Id NEVER invite people over to MY house then ignore all my guests and be cold..... thats RUDE if you want alone time dont habe people over", "OP's wife is just doing pretty normal things that would be considered polite or thoughtful in almost any other circumstance. There is absolutely no reason to be rude or cruel to her.\n\nYeah, OP's wife needs to understand that mom is a-typical and she needs to change her expectations, but that doesn't mean OP or his mom get to act like jerks to her.\n\nEveryone expects OP's wife to be the one to change who she is to accommodate mom. Why is that? Why can't OP's mom just understand that w/ most people, it is polite to bring something. It is easier to politely accept it and say \"thanks\" instead of taking it as a personal affront and being rude. OP has to run out to the car when his wife arrives to make sure nothing enters the house that might set off his mom? Seriously? \n\nWe know the mom isn't going to change and that OP and his family don't want to confront her on her rudeness, that is their choice, but it doesn't mean it is OK to be cruel to his wife b/c \"that's just the way mom is\" and sending the message that his wife doesn't get to be who she is b/c mom won't like it.", "Hard disagree. Mother is rude and wife was likely \"incessantly jabbering* due to feeling like a complete stranger in her husband's family home. \n\nNot gonna keep on the back and forth as we have different stances and aren't going to agree.", "Having a rough past is not an excuse to treat other people poorly. A trauma informed approach is not a free rang to behave poorly.", "Is that you Ron Swanson?", "My sister does this, I join sometimes. It\u2019s a weird peaceful to just watch the world around you. I think we all know her time is coming, and I\u2019m just happy she found peace after her long life", "It\u2019s more don\u2019t constantly bother me and keep talking even though I\u2019ve expressed my desire for you to be more quieter.", "That\u2019s a weird obsession to control other people\u2019s lives. Others don\u2019t have to like you or entertain you. \n\n>only allow certain people over.\n\nDuh, based on the story, that\u2019s how it has been for years.", "It sounded to me like she needed a break from the hustle and bustle of serving and eating dinner. Can't she have a moment in the calm when she feels overwhelmed? Especially since she recently lost her husband. Not everyone is an extrovert, that doesn't mean they should be shunned.", "Or she allows her children to bring people over because she loves her kids.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gross when said wife has shown she can not or will not control herself. And get real, if mom hadn\u2019t invited the wife, you would call her an ah because the wife wasn\u2019t invited.", "What if OP was a woman? Would MIL asking her daughter to take her wife away be gross?", "You are dense if you think \"doesn't want a bunch of small talk\" equals \"doesn't say a word to anyone\".", "If they kids are letting the mom do her own thing, she should follow the lead.", "Again, where at all does it say there\u2019s no interaction? She cooks food for everyone and they all eat, and she sits outside while everyone socializes together. She didn\u2019t refuse. She asked after multiple interactions for some quiet and when that was disrespected again, she asked her son to have his wife leave her be. Her boundaries should be respected even if yours would be further", "That\u2019s your house. When we host a dinner/party we engage. Our grown kids show up at our house whenever they want to.... hell they host parties at our house & we don\u2019t always involve ourselves. If my husband retreats downstairs to his \u201cplayroom\u201d no one should ever feel the need to entertain him. I also wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone bother him. He\u2019s not chatty. \n\nOP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have to go to MIL house when invited. Or maybe just don\u2019t follow her out on the porch. MIL kids don\u2019t seem to have an issue with it & there are other people for wife to talk to.", "Agree to disagree \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Inviting people over for lunch isn\u2019t treating people poorly. OP\u2019s childish wife is the only one who has issues with MIL liking to sit quietly on the porch.", "Feeding people and then hanging out while they enjoy themselves is not treating people poorly.", "Is disinterest behaving poorly? Is losing your patience bc someone has continuously infringed on your boundaries behaving poorly? I don't think so.", "I'm glad to hear that. My grandma passed a couple of years ago, and she seemed happy and at peace in her last few weeks.", "The way its written it seems she really goes out of her way to exclude wife and not interact with her. She diesnt have to talk for hours... but it sounds like MIL really just doesnt want wife around AT ALL", "Shes gping out of her way to neglect wife and not work on her own social skills....seriously.. its rude", "Sorry talking about someone like they aren\u2019t there is rude. Done. You might argue her rudeness was justified, that doesn\u2019t make it not rude.", "Well you're obviously reading the post very differently from how I am, which is why I'm saying this post is showing a stark contrast in how introverts and extroverts deal with the world. It doesn't sound to me like she's excluding the DIL at all since the DIL is still receiving invites. MIL is just asking the DIL (multiple times apparently, just in one visit) to tone down the small talk/invites for shopping/etc. This black and white thinking I'm seeing here where it's \"constant interaction\" or \"just be entirely alone forever then\" is fucking bizarre and honestly just shows how entitled extroverts feel to their method of socialization.", "There\u2019s no evidence of that in the post whatsoever. The only thing there is evidence of is the wife blatantly disrespecting MIL\u2019s boundaries."]}
