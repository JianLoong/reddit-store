It was, however, a bit harsh to say MIL will never love you wife. You could have picked better wording there. Something like \"Mom is an introvert. She just wants peace and quiet.

Hopefully you understand where she is coming from and help her understand not everyone will appreciate her.", "NTA, but there may be a better way to handle this. Your wife wants her MIL to love her, and your mom just doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth. Maybe you haven\u2019t communicated to your wife that her approach is having the opposite effect. Telling your wife that your mom will never love her isn\u2019t helpful. It might be true, but it\u2019s unhelpful.\nYour mom needs quiet and your wife is taking that from her. Your mom shows her love for her family by cooking for them, and your wife bringing food says to your mom that her food isn\u2019t good enough.\nYour wife is undermining herself because she can\u2019t or won\u2019t see past what she (your wife) would want instead of what your mom needs. They are both talking, and their messages are similar, but they aren\u2019t hearing each other.", "NTA.  Sounds like your wife is an extrovert and your mom is an introvert.  Your wife needs to try harder to understand that other people are not just like her and may have have different wants and needs.", "INFO:  Why does you mom ask people to come over and be quiet?  All the people or just your wife?", "Some people on this thread are being a little dense, IMO. So because Mom (who\u2019s had a hard life and just wants some peace and quiet) doesn\u2019t want to talk to her guests, she should just be left alone completely for the rest of her life? This is the way Mom can still participate in life and she clearly enjoys hanging out in quiet by herself or with others (who are also quiet, like the sister).\n\nI get sensory overwhelm from people who are constantly talking (which seems like OP\u2019s wife does\u2014well-intentioned, but still), and since OP (and Mom) have already made it clear she doesn\u2019t like to talk much, wife should easily respect that.\n\nThe only reason wife keeps breaking this boundary seems to be for her own personal gain of cultivating a relationship MIL doesn\u2019t want. OP edited that Mom did try to ask more gently (which she shouldn\u2019t even have to do because OP has made it abundantly clear to wife not to do all the things she continues to do).\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Considering you two are fully married I assume she isn\u2019t new to your mother\u2019s temperament. Your wife needs to be an adult and realise she cannot force the connection she wants with your mother.", "NTA. Your wife isn't being nice. Nice would be treating your mother they way your mother wants to be treated not the way your wife wants to treat her. \n\nI think saying \"love\" in the manner you did was probably not the most tactful way to say it but tact wasn't working.", "NTA. I don't think your wife has bad intentions at all, but she has to realize you can't force a relationship with someone, particularly when you're treating them the way you'd want to be treated rather than the way THEY want to be treated. If your mom were being actively disrespectful to your wife I would call you an AH for not standing up for her, but it sounds like your mom just wants to be left alone.", "NTA.. my husband's elderly aunt is exactly the same as OP's mom..in context my husband was raised mostly by her spinster aunt..she prefers being by herself reason why she never married. When, I first met her I tried to get her approval a lot.

I left her alone and she was happy! Sometimes, by not trying we get what we are aiming for I guess...", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like your mom has been rude at all, just apathetic. She didn\u2019t tell your wife to shut up, make you leave with her nor does it sound like she stops EVERYONE from interacting with *each other* while at her house. It sounds like your mom enjoys being around family and seeing you guys eat her food/fill her house, but she doesn\u2019t like all the actual socializing and trying to be outgoing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being introverted and still not wanting to be alone. \n\nIt seems like your wife has repeatedly disrespected your moms boundaries and comfort levels, and despite being asked politely to take it back a notch with only your mom, both by yourself and your mom, she still thinks her way of connecting is better rather than realizing there\u2019s different ways to connect with different people.", "NTA\nYour wife clearly has unrealistic expectations and is putting in effort that's making your mother more annoyed.", "NTA. Your wife is not respecting your mom\u2019s boundaries. Tell her if she really wants your mom to even like her, step one is respecting her requests for space and to not bring food over unasked for. Those are not unreasonable requests at all.", "NTA.  She can 'want to be loved by her MIL' until the cows come home, but MIL gets to determine that, not her.  And you're right, she's just making it worse.", "INFO: Who arranged this get together?

Impossible to know without her being evaluated. But it could also be that she's just particular.\n\nFor example, I like sitting quietly and enjoying a nice view with a cold beer or hot coffee. My kid is one of those there-can't-be-a-silent-moment people. I love him but we had to have a talk about how I love his company but if we're doing \"my thing\" he should be aware how I like things and when we do \"his thing\" I adopt his excitement and chatter, it's just meeting halfway and we both get to share something we enjoy.\n\nIt's possible your mother would be ok with your wife sitting down next to her on the porch with zero chatter, just sitting together.", "Your wife is TA. The old lady likes her peace and quiet and to not have her guests worry about things like bringing food. Your wife has been told this and still badgers her/ignores her wishes. She needs to get the message. Your mother isn't being rude, she's still hosting and providing food, just doesn't want bothering or to make small talk. No big deal.", "NTA\n\nYour mom wants to be left the hell alone.\n\nYour wife has an innate desire to be loved by her, and/or dote on her.\n\nOil and water don't mix.  Keep them apart as best you can.", "NTA.  It seems like your mom isn't mean, she is just apathetic in general.\n\nHow does your mom act around grandkids?  Is she disinterested in them as well?  How do you think she will treat your kids?", "NTA.  There\u2019s maybe a nicer way you could have said that to your wife, but your mom has made her boundaries clear.  Your wife might want a certain relationship, and she\u2019s entitled to want that, but she can\u2019t force it if your mom doesn\u2019t want the same relationship with her.\n\nThe fact that your mom has to say \u201cplease make her stop talking to me\u201d says that your wife is overstepping established boundaries and not respecting your mom\u2019s wishes.\n\nMaybe think more about your phrasing in the future, but I still say NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mother has clearly communicated her boundaries.

She seems desperate to get some sort of reaction out of your mother, but why can't she accept that love can be present without constantly looking at or talking to?", "Soft YTA. Your mother in law cooked a feast for you and her. That\u2019s her way of showing love. That\u2019s what you should have said instead of saying the love is not there.", "NTA but if your mother acts like that, why even bring your wife around her?", "Nobody is obligated to care about another person. If she doesn't want to make an effort, your wife needs to stop. I know that myself, I would reach the end of my rope and say things that won't be nice to get my point across.\n\nIt sounds like your mom is getting close to that.

You\u2019re literally telling your wife \u201cstop being so nice and trying to have a relationship with my mum. She will never love you\u201d is absolutely heartbreaking. I get she had a tough life but being cold towards family members, never wanting to talk or get to know your wife, makes her an asshole. It is disrespectful to have complete disinterest in guests you have invited to your house. \n\nGo and see your mother on your own. Stop bringing people around her that she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with. **Alls you\u2019re doing is hurting your wife, your marriage and your mother.** If your mother questions why she\u2019s not there anymore then you can explain that she was clearly uncomfortable around your wife and would not be quiet, so you told her that she will never love her and to stop trying.", "ESH. I don't understand why MIL who doesn't like people around, doesn't really want to talk to them, and seems to be content on her own - invites people over at all? And then doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that they are there? And, why you keep going, and still, take your wife when you know they don't gel and she'll be treated poorly? Why does your wife attend and seem to push for a relationship that you've told her isn't going to happen, other than \"that how it should be?\" \n\nI think you should visit your mom on your own, and if your wife is looking for a \"mom figure,\" plan to find elsewhere. Your \"family\" is who you make it. I had neighbors when I was in my 30s/40's that were almost like 2nd parents. Lol, concerned if I got home \"late,\" when they were old, asked me to watch the sickest while the other went to church, etc. Met a lady bowling that ended up being like a grandmother. Those relationships were organic, not forced. Hopefully your wife will be able to find something similar to offset the ostracism from your mom.", "ESH. Your mother doesn't have to like your wife but being old and having had a hard life doesn't entitle her to be rude to your wife. Asking for \"quiet\", asking you to \"take your wife away from her\" right on your wife's face?! WTF. That's not alright. Your mother is an asshole. \n\nYou're an asshole for making excuses for her and for continuing to bring your wife around your mother and expecting her to put up with being treated with a complete lack of respect by her MIL. Your wife shouldn't be pushing for a relationship your mother doesn't want, but you shouldn't demand her accept being treated like a leper. \n\nYour wife is kind of an asshole, too, because she needs to understand she can't force people to like her or to be social with her if they don't want it. Your mother has made it clear (and in the rudest way possible) she is not willing to be friendly toward her; she needs to let it go mostly because she's the only one being hurt.\n\nThat said, upon reading your comments, I think there's a high chance your mother is in a deep state of depression and has been for a while (you mention her antisocial behavior got worse after your father's passing). She should get help.", "So when you have kids your wife and child won\u2019t be expected to engage with your mother since she has no more love to give right?

Your mother included.\n\nYour wife is an AH because she doesn't actually care about GENUINELY bonding with your mother, she likes the IDEA of a \"close MIL/DIL relationship\". I know lots of women like her (and to be clear, this is not limited to women, but it's a trait that is often inculcated in women, to be \"sociable\" and \"outgoing\" even at the cost of being genuinely caring or empathetic): self-absorbed, and so caught up in the idea of how a particular relationship \"should\" work that they don't actually stop to listen to the other person, or respect their boundaries. They end up rubbing everyone the wrong way.\n\nYour wife, it seems, doesn't ask what your mother would like from her. Instead she storms into every get-together like the proverbial bull in the china shop, being exhausting and overbearing, offering \"help\" that your mother doesn't want and that may even read as offensive (e.g. bringing food when part of your mother's pride and joy is cooking and providing plentiful meals for her guests), and talking endlessly to a woman who is clearly an introvert who values her quiet time. \n\nYou are a MASSIVE AH for telling your wife that your mother \"will never love her\" when even you admit that's not necessarily true, if she would change her behaviour. What an unnecessarily cruel, disgusting thing to say. I can't think of anything you could possibly say to someone you are supposed to care about that is more clearly intended to be hurtful.\n\nYes, you are right to talk to your wife about how she interacts with your mother, to tell her that her behaviour is damaging the relationship, and to explain how she could improve their interactions. But just telling her, \"My mother will never love you,\" is an awful thing to say that serves no purpose except to hurt her.\n\nAnd your mother is an AH because, well, your description of her isn't actually a defense of her behaviour, it's just the definition of being an AH:\n\n>She had a really hard life, doesn\u2019t have much affection left to give and she rarely gets close to anyone. It\u2019s pure disinterest and she can\u2019t bring herself to care about new people.\n\nShe doesn't have to be best friends with anyone, but that doesn't give her licence to treat people like shit either. If she cannot be kind, or at least polite and reasonably friendly, she shouldn't be inviting people into her home. \"Pure disinterest\" in how you treat people is literally just a synonym for \"not giving a shit\" . . . or assholery. You are literally telling us that your mother is an asshole, and expecting us to . . . what?  Call her something else? No. She's a grown ass adult. If she treats people rudely, then she's an AH. Being old and tired is not an excuse for not having basic manners. And I say that as someone who is old and exhausted.\n\nESH.

Bringing food to a food-bases gathering is basic etiquette. Your mom is being rude to your wife because she wants to control everything. She needs to be gracious or stop inviting you to food-bases gatherings, or maybe use her big girl words to actually talk to your wife and let her know her preference is to not have outside food at meals she hosts.\n\nYour wife doesn't get to crawl up her butt and ignore all her boundaries, either.

Sometimes there's something going haywire with their hormones or nervous system, and the proper treatment can provide a lot of relief in everyday life as well as social situations.

If she doesn't want to do well by YOU and be amiable with your wife, then you as a husband should be protecting your wife from your mother's clear \"disinterest\" (I view it as more of a hatred from the get go for no other reason than that she wants to use being old to be an AH) . If your mom doesn't want to have company or entertain company, then she shouldn't be inviting people over. Period. If she wants a quiet and peaceful life, then the option here is to not host events where there are people who want to reasonably socialize. Having people over is an invitation to being okay with communication and being polite. Your mom is not being a good hostess by ignoring her guests. I don't care how old she is. If she doesn't have the bandwidth to talk, she doesn't have the bandwidth to host.\n\nYou all need a lesson on boundaries and self-awareness.\n\n1. Your wife: It's great she wants a good relationship with your mom. If your wife is being too involved, your mother is old enough to communicate she isn't in a talking mood. That said, once again, if your mom is hosting everyone, she is also accepting to a degree being amiable and being a good hostess and communicating with her DIL. Either your mom stops inviting her over or your wife should start hosting events if her social meter is higher. Since your wife was given adequate warning, I think it's fair to say E.S.H because she should have taken the hint and left her alone for a wee-bit. Honestly, it sounds like the event went past the time it should have so your mom can have some time to wind down. Take note of that and remove your wife and yourself around that time so your mom gets to recharge. Personally, I think bringing something is more of a polite thing - many households around the world you wouldn't consider showing up empty handed unless expressly told otherwise. Your wife will need to tame her expectations, and perhaps a therapist can help her navigate that.\n2. Your mom: She clearly doesn't have the capacity to be a good hostess to ALL of her guests. I am all for the isolated, semi-grumpy old granny life-style. But that goes out the window when you are hosting people. If she doesn't have the energy to be a good hostess, she shouldn't be having people over. Her telling you to fetch your wife like she's some annoying puppy was incredibly rude, no matter how annoying your wife was being. Once again, I think your mom shouldn't be hosting. She wants a isolated and quiet life, and her current actions are counter to that. Clearly your wife feels unwelcomed - and while her MIL may not be as bad as others, being less involved and treating her like a yappy mutt is not okay either. Your mother needs to muster up some level of affection for your wife, even if it is passively through a text, email, or heartfelt card for the sake of YOUR  marriage and family. It's not that hard, and if she cared about YOU as her child, she would make sure your wife wasn't feeling like she has to prove herself so much.  If she can't muster that, then your mother will need to accept you and your wife might not come around as much (Because, rightfully, you are both a package deal and it's otherwise rude to invite one partner but not the other).\n3. You: You should know well enough that your main support is your wife. You married her. If your mom isn't going to make a progressive effort to make sure your wife feels welcome in the family (and I think her excuse that she's old and therefore can't be bothered to get to know new people is unacceptable), then you need to find an alternative. That might mean you and your wife start hosting things, and giving your mom a proper means to leave if she wants to (or even not come if she doesn't want to). Saying your mother is incapable of showing your wife any level of affection is just beyond the pale. Your mother is capable - she is just choosing not to.", "NTA. My (33F) mom is like this too. Lots of past trauma. Honestly I feel like I could have written this post. My partners \u2026. Don\u2019t push it but they def don\u2019t love visiting.

But instead of trying to accept that wife is trying to convert MIL to her preferred way of showing/receiving affection. This is kinda selfish imo.\n\nThe real solution to this is to stop raising people to be people pleasers. And stop labeling all silences as awkward. Silence is not always awkward, it's only awkward if you make it awkward. Sometimes enjoying some peaceful silence with loved ones is the best kind of bonding.

Look up \"hostess gift\" for ideas.\n\nETA: Also, if your wife, and you, want a different type of social event, invite people over and host it yourself.  Then you can do the cooking, and decide whom, if anyone, you want to accept offers of help from, etc.\n\nIf your mother's hosting style is \"I will cook vast amounts of good food, and then we'll all sit quietly and relax and have a peaceful, quiet evening (except for when I beat you at checkers!) that's her prerogative as a host.\n\nOther family members can host other events to their taste.", "Is it just awful?

I've brought silent gestures and I've tried vocal gestures (chatting) and nothing seems to work. My spouse says to leave her alone, but that feels like giving up! \n* If I give up on making MIL aware that I love her child, then I will have failed to show my dedication to spouse. And my spouse will never be able to be comfortable with us in the same room! I love spouse so much I will continue trying even though it hurts my feelings. \n* My SIL seems to like me okay...maybe if I go with her to talk to MIL it won't be as awkward.\n* MIL won't talk to me.

Instead I am on eggshells trying not to act too strange and get her to be in the same room as me. No matter what I do I'm failing...\n\nYour wife is not trying to ignore you. Your wife is also not trying to annoy your mother. Your wife cares very deeply about earning a place in your family and clearly has anxiety about it. (These are all my own internal monologues). The sad answer is I don't know how to make her better, only to let her know that it's hard but it does ease up. The awkward tension can be mitigated by spending time with other members of the family that enjoy chatting more. She can live with a neutral MIL just like she can live with neutral colleagues. She needs to let the DREAM of MIL go. MIL will never live up to the dream world of perfect familial integration in her head.

I agree with you on everything honestly, your wife is also an AH for ignoring your mom\u2019s request for quiet, but saying she\u2019ll never love your wife is definitely a low blow. There\u2019s a difference between being firm and just being cruel, and I think that statement crosses over into cruel territory. You need to tell your wife firmly yet respectfully that talking isn\u2019t helping at all, and your mom would like her much more if she could reflect her quiet nature. I feel like your wife just makes connections through socialization, but she needs to understand that not everyone is like that (especially older people).

Your mother may grow to love your wife if your wife is willing to show her love in the way MIL needs, which to me sounds like quiet company, acknowledgement or praise of the food she loves to put out for people, etc. rather than in the ways your wife likes to experience love which sounds a little more extroverted and active. Explaining that to your wife would have been much nicer and more effective in creating a good relationship between her and MIl than making it seem like your wife is inherently unlovable.

Find a quiet place until it's socially acceptable to leave. However, if I am hosting an event, I've accepted that I'm committed to participating in the event. This means the full event in its entirety, not having dinner and hiding from all my guests. As you stated, if MIL is not prepared for, or simply does not desire, this social commitment, perhaps it's time to find a new host for these gatherings.

Honest question. \n\nMost people in life aren't going to love you. Love is a special strong word for your deepest and most connected caring relationships. There are many people I like but don't love. Expecting everyone to feel a powerful deep emotional connection to you isn't really fair or realistic? \n\nLots of people *like* their in-laws but don't love them. I feel that's pretty normal? Not everyone feels deeply emotionally close to someone beacuse their family member got married. It's not an insult? I only love my husband, kids, my very closest friends, and some of my other family members.

You show up with something.\n\n  \n\n\nI can see OPs wife coming from a family/culture like that and just not integrating well.

I'm a psychologist who often works with elderly folks and to me it sounds like she has some signs of it. \"Tired of life\", general disinterest, and being distant are big signs, especially if she wasn't always like this, at least to this extent. It might be worth trying to get her some help. No one deserves to live out their final years sad and depressed.", "Wife is definitely giving retriever energy. Lol. Mil is a black cat.

I think the wife sees love as long chats, mani/pedis, and shopping trips. That isn't the type of person her MIL is and she needs to learn to accept that. I mean I'm sure she loves her own daughter and grandkid, but OP says that when she is on the porch if they are out there with her they sit in silent just watching the garden. So I think the wife just needs to accept that her MIL like/love language is not the same as hers and that that's okay.", "Hay were twins lol.

But family is hugely important to me and as I say, if I didn't feel like my in laws cared about me that would cause problems for me that would need to be sorted before I got married.

But the MIL in this story isn't just quiet, shy, introverted, or a woman of few words (according to OP). He says she is \"disinterested\" in everyone and \"doesn't care about new people.\" So... that DOES determine the quality of the relationship. She quite simply doesn't want a relationship with her daughter-in-law, and I can see why a person would get her feelings hurt about being rejected by someone so important to their partner.\n\nDIL should absolutely respect the woman's need for peace and quiet.

I'm aware the hurt feelings are not just stemming from the MIL's lack of interest in small talk but from her general disinterest in the DIL.
