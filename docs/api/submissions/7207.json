For the most part we see eye to eye on things, with the occasional spat here and there. The last few months I\u2019ve been seriously looking at getting a dog. My gf was okay with this until she found out the breed I was looking at.\n\nRottweilers are my all time favorite since I was a kid. They\u2019re big lovable goofballs who will protect family fiercely if needed. My gf is aware of my love of the breed, as I\u2019ve voiced it repeatedly. However she\u2019s under the impression that they\u2019re an aggressive breed. I\u2019ve tried to educate her on this misconception numerous times but she remains stubborn. \n\nShe suggested I get a more family friendly breed like a Golden Retriever or a Lab. I have nothing against those breeds, I\u2019ve just always dreamed of owning a Rottie. Plus Rotties are great family dogs. \n\nWell I decided to bite the bullet and get a Rottie of my own. I informed my gf of this and that I would love her to meet him when he\u2019s here. She was absolutely livid about this. She said that she would not set foot anywhere near him. I tried to reassure that he was just puppy and would be enrolled in training asap. That still wasn\u2019t good enough. \n\nShe said that if I got this dog she would never come to my place again. I said she was being unfair and that if it was any other breed she wouldn\u2019t care. She called me inconsiderate and reckless for doing this. I argued that it was inconsiderate to assume he was gonna be some aggressive monster. She then proceeded to give me the ultimatum of her or the dog. I was flabbergasted at this. I tried to reconcile with her and have her see he\u2019s just a puppy. She just stonewalled me and refuses to speak with me further on the matter. \n\nShe left and has been messaging me that getting this dog is a mistake. I feel like she\u2019s being unfair and not giving him a chance.\n\nTomorrow morning I\u2019ll be driving to pick up the puppy. I\u2019m bummed that she\u2019s not giving him a fair shot at all. I also don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll come back from this. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong for this, but maybe I am.

If she spends time at your home you\u2019re forcing this on her so YTA. \n\nI love Rottweilers, but I would never just go buy a dog my long term partner hates and then be like- deal with it. If the dogs more important then your relationship then fine, break things off.", "I\u2019m hesitant to give a judgment, but I will say that if you get this dog your relationship might be over.

Same applies here.", "ESH. She isn't listening to you and you're not listening to her. She gave you an ultimatum (her or the dog) but you kinda did the same by telling her you were getting the dog with or without her consent. You both sound deeply immature and possibly incompatible, both on this specific issue and your general total unwillingness to listen to the other. \n\nIf it helps, I think she's being *more* the asshole for being bigoted about a perfectly safe dog breed.

It might be a little different if you were just dumb and got it without asking but you knew she didn't like the idea. She is free to not want to be around that dog and that can mean your relationship ends. She was likely thinking about the future where she is living with you or having her kids around it.\n\nIrrational or not you needed to get her approval. By getting the dog anyway you signaled to her that you don't really care about her opinion. Maybe that you don't care about the future together or just expect her to go along with everything you want. The ultimatum idea isn't good but it may have also just been her explaining what your actions are going to lead to.", "YTA. Regardless of what anyone thinks of her bias about dog breeds, you clearly don't take her seriously in this long term relationship.", "YTA you have by this action either informed her that you don\u2019t give a shit about how she feels, don\u2019t see a future together, or both.", "Nah - you want a rottie, she doesn't.

At 23, if we do the math, a serious relationship could/should lead to live together in the dog's lifetime. I would say it could lead to live together in few years.\n\nSo: you have told her you don't want to live with her in the future and you aren't interested in a stable relationship with her.

What are you naming your Rottweiler?", "I have Rottweilers, I love them, they are a commitment above and beyond a lab or a golden, and not dogs generally recommended for first time dog owners, certainly not for people without a lot of time, room and commitment. \n\nAs an example, I live on three fenced acres, and I hike with my dogs in the woods for at least an hour a day, as well as swimming, training, nose work, various other activities. A young Rottweiler is a big strong exuberant dog who needs a lot of exercise, stimulation and work to live with you peacefully and happily. Ever treating a dog like this as a family guardian is a slippery slope, that characteristic is innate in them, it doesn\u2019t need to be encouraged, and can in fact be counterproductive. Gf aside, be sure you are ready for this commitment, which is a long one, and will require no small daily effort, no time off, and no \u2018don\u2019t feel like it\u2019 days. \n\nSeriously. You are right, they are wonderful dogs, funny, joyful, athletic, crazy smart, but that\u2019s not all, so please be sure what you\u2019re getting into and if it\u2019s the right time in your life and situation to do it.\n\np.s. be aware of expenses as well, as an example, my now three year old puppy had an orthopedic injury, total fluke, at six months old, that was a 9k surgery, six + wks of rehab, after that she was spayed and also plexed to prevent bloat, which can kill a large dog, and that was prob another 6k. So, just know that stuff happens and it will always be more $$ with a large breed dog.", "YTA\n\n\n\nYou are not an ahole for getting that dog.\n\n\n\nYou are an ahole because you feel entilted to expect her to accept this. She told you she wouldn't. You wont come back from this. You made this decision informed about the consequences. \n\n\nCalling her unfair, inconsidered and stubborn (ha! She is the one who wanted to compromise) is just childish of you. \n\n\n\nYes, it is your dog. And again- you can place this having this breed of dog over the relationship with your gf. All of that is ok. \n\n\nBut the rest is not.", "YTA. Now me, I love all dogs and I think Rottweilers are great. But I'd doubt the sanity of ANYBODY who sees it as a selling point when dogs \"protect their family fiercely\". In my experience lots of people love the idea of a big strong dog that will \"protect\" them and ignore that to be able to do that a dog needs to be trained by expert hands, otherwise it will protect you from the mailman, the neighbour's kid etc. \n\nHave you owned dogs before, how long, what breeds, how well trained were they? If my husband came to me saying he wanted to get a Rotti because they're great and protective I'd be unhappy about that, too, because he doesn't know shit about dogs and I'd be the one who'd end up picking up the pieces.", "YTA Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re all about your gf when you ignored her opinion. You now have a choice to make", "ESH - you shouldn\u2019t have just \u2018bit the bullet\u2019 and expected her to be okay with it. How about her being introduced to the puppy before you purchased it? If this is an indication of how you make decisions in the relationship then I\u2019d be seeing red flags if I were her. \n\nShe could have been more open to a compromise and doing some more research. It is bizarre that she has this huge hang up on this one particular breed. \n\nBoth of your decisions/reactions are troublesome.", "As someone else said a dog is a multi year commitment. You just proved to your girlfriend you don\u2019t see a future with her or value her as a partner.

Yta", "YTA congrats on being single", "I have breeds of dog I'm not comfortable with.  I'm very aware intellectually that dogs are individuals, that a given dog would probably be fine, and that puppies especially are liable to be harmless and will be mostly a product of their upbringing.  And yet, you still won't catch me living with any of those breeds.\n\nIt is what it is, OP.  She's not going to become comfortable with them just because you want her to.  You're either giving up on the rottweiler, or you're giving up on the girlfriend.\n\nedit: whoops, I misread 'together for 3 years' as '*lived* together for 3 years'.  But still YTA, to be honest.  If you get this dog, you're making it impossible for her to live with you, which torpedoes any hope of the relationship getting any more serious than it is now.", "well, you don't live with her so you can adopt whatever pet you want at your place... but I'm guessing you plan to live with her in the future. maybe try to get one of your mutual friends involved so he could conviced her that the breed isn't a problem and that it won't be aggressive? idk I feel like she's just throwing a tantrum over a breed because if she didn't want a dog I would understand, but she does like the idea of having a dog so she's just stubborn about her preconceptions on this breed. but at the same time, if you're okay to just throw away your relationship for a dog you haven't yet, are you really in love with her ?", "NTA. You don't live together, so you didn't even need her approval in getting a dog. She approved of it, which is nice. But it is your dog, so she has no say in what breed you get. \n\nI would understand if it was rational; like if you were trying to get a husky, but she told you not to because their energy levels are difficult to manage for a first time dog owner. Or if you were trying to get a great pyrenees, but she told you not to because they are a livestock guardian dog meant to work on a large territory.\n\nWhile rottweilers have their difficulties, you seem to be prepared; you are starting training with a professional immidiately, which is absolutely great. And it also seems like you have done proper research to know that this is the dog for you, and a breed you can handle.\n\nYour gf is not using logic here, her only argument is that \"they are aggressive\", which is not true. If she had given a logical explanation to why she does not want you to get a rottweiler, it would have been nice of you to think about some other breed. But simply \"tHeY aRe AgGrEsSiVe\" holds no ground.\n\nAnd her giving you an ultimatimun of \"either me or the dog\" is absolutely childish. No one needs those people in their lives. Keep the pupper and raise them to be a good doggo, and get a girlfriend who has a better understanding of god breeds - and of dogs in general.\n\nBtw I have have a friend whose family breeds rottweilers. If they truly were \"aggressive\", no breeders with small kids would have them.", "YTA, they\u2019re obviously more aggressive than non guard breeds regardless of what you want to be true", "YTA.\n\nThis is a very personal subject for me. My daughter was mauled to death by my neighbors pitbull. \n\nNo person should ever feel uncomfortable in an animals presence. Humans should always come first.\n\nIf your girlfriend is uncomfortable with Rottweilers (I don't fucking blame her) you should respect that. \n\nBut you didn't.

So do her a favor and leave with your dream dog and let her find a man that truly cares about how she feels.", "YTA you have plenty of time to have a Rottie in your life.

I love my Apollo and Ares they are 153 pounds and 135 pounds balls of cuddley goodness. Got them when puppies and Apollo, my big boy was actually the runt of the litter so he was an add on because they did not think he would live.

Granted she sucks because she gave an ultimatum, but you should have taken her opinion into account.", "NTA\n\nTell her see ya later! First off, she's not afraid of dogs as she clearly doesn't mind other breeds of dogs. It's very clear that she has a thing about a few certain breeds of dogs. Which is fine, but she has zero right to give you an ultimatum. She doesn't live with you and you didn't spend any of her money. Therefore, she doesn't get any say in how you spend your money. The fact that you've agreed to send the dog to training and the fact that it's a puppy shows just how uncooperative she's being.", "NTA, your girlfriend is not well informed and bases her decision on uhm? hearsay? gossip? not sure. But it says something about her. You have made the decision to get the dog, so I guess you think the dog is more important than your gf. In this case you might not be wrong. But either way, you seem to be single again. So enjoy that dog and yes, take it to training.", "NTA", "NTA- Every day with a Rottie is a gift.   \nAt your age 3 years is nothing, find a new lady.   \nIn my experience with a beautiful Rottie at your side finding the right woman will be pretty easy.", "I mean it\u2019s your place. If you\u2019re taking full responsibility and she doesn\u2019t live with you, it\u2019s within your right to get the dog. \n\nBUT you knew that your girlfriend has an issue with Rottweilers. She made that abundantly clear before you decided to get it. \n\nSo honestly you have no right to be upset that she won\u2019t come around anymore: You chose to get a dog you knew she doesn\u2019t like. \n\nYou made this situation. \n\nSo it comes down to boundaries and hills to die on. \n\nYour girlfriend made the boundary that she won\u2019t have anything to do with the dog.

As in, find somebody with one and get her together with the dog. Let her see that, when properly cared for, they are lovely animals? And if she was still objecting to it...

There are two reasons: people are more likely to neglect training because \"it can't be dangerous\" and little dogs are more likely to feel threatened/anxious. But because they are smaller the injuries aren't usually reported.\n\nAbout ten years ago a group gathered information on dog bites. They ruled out guard and attack dogs, only accounting for pets. They also asked people rather than just going on medical/police reports. The most likely breed to bite, as well as turn on it's owner, was the Dachshund. The first five were all small dogs, actually. Then after that you had the retriever, pitties, German shepherds, and rottweilers. The trainers they interviewed all said the same thing I did about why.", "Even though you guys aren\u2019t living together, I still kind of think YTA here.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to do all this damage control with reassuring her about the breed, that he\u2019ll just be a puppy, that he will be enrolled in training immediately, etc. You want her to give this puppy a chance. \n\nHowever, the proper thing to do in my opinion would\u2019ve been to try to get her to give the puppy a chance *before* just straight deciding to get a dog without her approval, hoping she\u2019d just simply fall in love/change her mind. I feel like personally either you felt like you wouldn\u2019t be able to convince her to meet the puppies, or you were just so wrapped up in your own wants that you impulsively bought the puppy with the hopes of what I previously mentioned. I think it would\u2019ve been better/ easier to try to get her to meet / spend time with some puppies and try to plead/convince her into you getting one. That\u2019s where you could\u2019ve laid out all the positive things about the breed, all the plans you had for the puppy, and gave all the reassurance you could offer in regards to getting it. I feel like at that point you guys could\u2019ve had a serious conversation, because ultimately if she still wasn\u2019t willing to budge and you still adamantly really wanted to get the puppy - either someone would have to compromise, or eventually it\u2019d ultimately always come back to this ultimatum / deal breaker. \n\nSo in reality it does come down to is having your dream breed worth your relationship with this woman? Is it worth it to throw away this relationship for someone who will accept the dog, or is it worth it to fight for this relationship and compromise on the breed? Because in her eyes you\u2019ve made your choice, and you\u2019re continuing to make it because she\u2019s not only expressed her feelings on the dog, but after you decided to get one anyway she\u2019s again expressed how she feels and you\u2019re on your way to pick up the dog with only potential thoughts that you may be the asshole. \n\nFor those who feel YNTA because you live alone and it\u2019s your choice, there\u2019s some things to consider about that as well. The obvious has already been stated that you guys have been together for three years and this is a puppy. Dogs do have decent life spans, so the thought is that most likely your relationship will eventually progress to moving in / marriage, therefore her wanting this dog / to live with this type of dog does matter. But, aside from that, they\u2019re not in the \u2018dating\u2019 phase where she just met him, he has a breed of puppy she doesn\u2019t like or a cat or hell a kid and she gets to go \u201cthat\u2019s not for me\u201d and dip\u2026 this person basically trapped her with a dog like \u2018whether you like it or not I got this dog that\u2019s going to be around whenever you\u2019re here and when we eventually move in together it\u2019ll be our shared pet/responsibility\u201d this isn\u2019t some high school relationship or we started dating a month ago. These are two adults, in their twenties, been together for years. Those factors matter when it comes to this IMO.", "YTA. \n\nShe clearly expressed boundaries, you broke them, she gave an ultimatum.

In her shoes I'd be questioning if you even cared about being with me. \n\nSecond, she has every right to have concerns if you've discussed a future together. Which sounds like the case since she suggested family friendly dogs. People think that any dog of any breed can be lassie with the right training, but the reality is there are medical and behavioral streaks in all dog breeds that should be considered when making a choice. That protective streak you love so much can be indiscriminate in a high stress situation. If a child was running up to yours they don't necessarily see another child that they should care with, they may see a threat and act accordingly. Just like I wouldn't recommend a greyhound to someone whose country vet doesn't know how to read their blood work and isn't concerned about doing regular xrays, I wouldn't recommend high strung breeds or pitties in situations with children. One shining example on tik tok doesn't negate the risk. Beyond that, many perfect dogs with nerves of steel start losing it in old age. They get cranky, senile, groggy, and hurt just like old humans do, and it makes them less tolerant. They might be perfect family dogs when they're 5, and then suddenly turn on someone by mistake when they're 10 over an accident. If theyre touchy to begin with youre compounding risk. Some dog breeds are a specialty. You like them, great, but you haven't considered how they'll fit into your life over time and just assumed it'll all work out because you like them.\n\nAlso, you should check your lease/home owner or renters' insurance and make sure you're covered. These breeds negate their responsibility and shove all the liability to you in a case of an animal related invlcident if owning one is counter to the contract you signed.

And you'll most likely be completely unable to contain them if they actively refuse. If she insisted on a small breed like a frenchie or chihuahua it would have been more understandable for me. Cause while small breeds can still do a lot of damage if they decide to, you can physically restrain them. \n\nExample scenario: you're walking your dog on a leash, dog decides to attack a random passerby (which means you royally fucked up with your training but that's not the point here). With a larger breed like a lab or rottie you most likely won't be able to physcially stop them, especially if they are wearing a harness. With a chihuahua or a similar tiny/small breed?

She was the snuggliest, most loving dog I could have asked for, especially considering all the shit she put up with herding three kids around all the time.

He has an inherent desire to protect home and family, and is an intelligent dog of extreme hardness and adaptability with a strong willingness to work, making him especially suited as a companion, guardian and general all-purpose dog. The behavior of the Rottweiler in the show ring should be controlled, willing and adaptable, trained to submit to examination of mouth, testicles, etc. **An aloof or reserved dog should not be penalized, as this reflects the accepted character of the breed**. An aggressive or belligerent attitude towards other dogs should not be faulted. A judge shall excuse from the ring any shy Rottweiler. A dog shall be judged fundamentally shy if, refusing to stand for examination, it shrinks away from the judge. **A dog that in the opinion of the judge menaces or threatens him/her, or exhibits any sign that it may not be safely approached or examined by the judge in the normal manner, shall be excused from the ring**. ***A dog that in the opinion of the judge attacks any person in the ring shall be disqualified***.\n\nThis directly contradicts you.

The prey drive doesn\u2019t exist or isn\u2019t as dangerous in other dogs/\u201c.\n\nIf you go watch interviews with the owners of the dogs that have attacked, other than the total asshole it\u2019s always\u201d \u201cdaisy is a velvet hippo who\u2019s never hurt anyone and went to professional training, I can\u2019t believe she killed my toddler and wife\u201d.\n\nEvery single time one of these dogs attacks someone it\u2019s always \u201cshocking and completely against the 10k we spent training them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fucking animal lol. If a chihuahua bites you you can punt it across the globe, pits you can stab and it\u2019ll bite as it bleeds to death.\n\nTraining make it poop outside instead of in, not completely ignore it\u2019s biological design. Hunting dogs were meant to hunt. Same with fighting dogs.", "You\u2019re so wrong it hurts. There was a family in the news recently, two pits, raised from puppies, great dogs, trained, was great with their two kids\u2026 until the pitbulls ate them. Child and baby. Eaten. It\u2019s in their genetics, you can\u2019t train it out. Pitbulls are a dangerous breed, maybe you should get your emotions in check and notice we aren\u2019t saying they are bad, just more dangerous. Would you rather have a hand gun in your house or a bomb? Tada that\u2019s what this is."]}
