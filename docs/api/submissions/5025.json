I just booked weekends off here and there. Onto my story\n\nMy birthday is early May, this year (when the story takes place) it happened to fall on a Saturday (woohoo) my department manager also gave me the Sunday off, (it was my 30th), and because I was on a grandfather contract I didn\u2019t have to work Sundays\n\nI worked the next weekend, third weekend I booked off for a wedding with my boyfriend at the time (it was a three hour drive and we were spending the night)\nFourth weekend we had an extended king weekend trip booked for an event in LA\n\nAbout a week later the store manager confronted me (he was new so he didn\u2019t know better) and told me I couldn\u2019t keep booking weekends off\n\nI lit into him and told him \u201cI am ALLOWED to have a life outside of this job. I am entitled to FOUR weeks vacation, which I NEVER take. I also do NOT have to work Sundays as when I was hired Sundays were still considered a holiday. I almost never call off sick, I just happened to need three weekends off last month.\u201d\n\nHe was stunned to say the least. I took it as my sign to quit. I had wanted to quit for a long time, but once I hit three weeks paid vacation it was harder to walk away from the seniority I had built up. I\u2019d like to say I got a better job and my life is great now. But sadly this is real life and I\u2019m still stuck in a different minimum wage job. Though this boss is very chill and is cool with me knitting/crocheting when it\u2019s not busy\n\nSo the point of my long story is, you\u2019re young, you probably aren\u2019t depending on this money to survive. Don\u2019t waste your time being miserable. Tell the manager to \u201cfuck off\u201d what\u2019s he going to do fire you?  Great. Go get a job some where else. Now is the time to work on growing a spine made of steel\n\nLook into the trades, take any and all shop classes offer at your school. Look into youth apprenticeship programs. I went back to school to learn a trade at 38. I\u2019m now running into the issue of no one wants to hire me because I don\u2019t have experience (and the companies complain that they can\u2019t find workers. They\u2019re choices are \u2018nothing\u2019 or \u2018student\u2019 and they\u2019d rather have nothing and whine about it)\nThere are programs to help folks fine positions in the trades. But they usually cut off at the 25 mark\n\nYou are young, you\u2019re not relying on this money to survive. So tell the manager to fuck off and live your life.", "NTA and file a complaint with HR.

Can you go to HR or your manager's boss and tell them what's going on?  That's a ridiculoous demand to make of a 16 year old.", "NTA. Never let a manager take advantage of you like that. You are absolutely not the AH for using your time off and making time to have a life. Your manager is a massive AH for treating you like that and expecting you to be available on your days off, especially around the holidays.If they are shorthanded that is 100% their problem for not staffing better, and not your problem in the slightest.\n\nIt sounds like he has it out for you. Some managers are like that. They will come into a new job and try to flex their muscle by pushing employees around so assert dominance, or they will get a bug up their ass about someone over something trivial, and make a target of them. Its a human defect, when we get a negative impression of someone, even if its over something trivial, it can colour how we see everything they do and suddenly everything is their fault or they do everything wrong, even if its not the case at all. Its like a weird glitch in the human brain.\n\nAnd some managers are petty little tyrants. Either way, your manager sucks and you shouldn't let him take advantage of you. Managers like that prey on young and inexperienced (and often foreign as well) workers because they often don't know their rights or are too scared to stand up for themselves and make waves, and so are easier to push around and take advantage of.  Take the time to learn your rights, and how to stand up for them now. The only way these manager types get away with it is because people let them. They need us far more than we need them.\n\nYour time off is your time off. You're not obligated to change your plans or be there and you are never an AH for sticking to that. He absolutely can't dictate what you do on those days or tell you not to make plans.

DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP.\n\nYour day off is your own, and your manager absolutely can't rely on you on those days. If he wanted you to be on call, he would have to PAY you to be on call.\n\nNTA.

You have and will always have the right to make plans on your days off. You are 16 years old but even as you get older. You time off from work is your own. They don't own you and nothing is owed to them. This guy is little for bullying a girl and is quite pathetic. Just stand your ground. Quit that job if it gets too bad. No job is worth that and especially at your age. Jobs are a dime a dozen. You deserve better!", "Something that took me a while to learn is that you don't have to hate your job. I've had jobs that made me dread waking up in the morning. I've also had jobs that were really enjoyable. And some in the middle. You don't have to stick to a company that doesn't value you.

Here's the really fun, almost secret thing: jobs that pay minimum wage are like tissue paper. They don't care about you? Sweet! You don't have to care about them! The amazing thing for you is that working isn't the important thing here. You're in school, in every way! Think of this job like another class, except it's a LIFE class.

Imagine how good handing in your notice will be.", "Well in that case just quit. If the higher ups don't care, there is nothing to be done about that manager's nonsense. That head manager isn't going to change anything, she is just avoiding giving you a straight answer rather than dealing with it. All it takes is a direct yes or no, she'd rather just ignore it in hopes you give up and stay put. She probably doesn't want to outright say no because she's worried you'd quit. So, take it as a no, because functionally, that's what her answer was, and just quit.", "There are lots of good managers out there.

It deserves to fail. You're being exploited.", "This is not healthy or OK. Breaks are essential and shouldn't be skipped. Forcing yourself to skip them is poor time management and basically self harm, and I promise you this job is not worth that. If they lack the staff to finish everything unless people skip breaks, that is their problem not yours. The manager should be covering that to make sure it gets done. If they aren't making sure breaks are covered that is their failure. My last manager would cover breaks herself regularly, and when we were shorthanded she'd come in from home (she lived a block away) if we needed a break covered in the evening or on a weekend shift. I became Manager on Duty, and I always made sure everyone got their breaks before I even took mine, and I was always last to leave on that shift. That is how a manager should do it.  \n\n\nAt my current job, I run a wood shop, but we have a separate retail area. I am the solo shop guy so I just manage myself.  \nThe retail staff have a whole plan for breaks so they are always covered, nobody misses a break, and the manager steps in as needed to cover for people so they can get their breaks. If a task doesn't get finished, people don't stay late, they just finish it tomorrow.  \n\n\nThis depends on the industry, but as a general rule if you don't finish it today, it will still be there tomorrow, unless you're a dishwasher or something like that. There is very rarely any need to skip breaks or stay late, especially in any job a 16 year old could get.  \n\n\nOverworking yourself is extremely unhealthy and will burn you out so fast. My uncle worked nearly 100 hours a week, and dropped dead in his shop from a stroke in his late 40s.", "Having work experience helps a lot. People see that you're currently employed and have been for a while and see it as a sign that you're a good worker. This is especially true when you're super young since it shows you've got enough maturity and responsibility for the job. You'll almost certainly have an easier time now with a bit more on your resume."]}
