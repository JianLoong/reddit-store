Have you told them?\n\nThis job is definetely not worth the pain and anguish.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA. I wish I could tell you it gets better, but managers are more often than not toxic as fuck.

And you should tell your manager to google the 13th Amendment", "NTA.  You're not on this earth to make his life easier.  Telling you not to make plans for your days off is outrageous.  He's intimidating you because he can.  At your age, you should be concentrating on school and relationships with family and friends.  Your job should come in third or lower.  Going to see your sister is good.  Having an AH boss is not good.", "Nta. Look up the labor laws in your state. In a lot of states minors aren\u2019t even supposed to be working that many hours.", "NTA and it\u2019s time to start looking for another job.

Let him e-mail that to you.\n\nAlso check the laws in your area re: the amount of hours a minor is permitted to work, how much break time and time off are required.\n\nThere may be a poster near the time clock or in the break room with that info.\n\nMy area has strict limits for minors. YMMV.\n\nStart making copies of your schedule, AND write down the ACTUAL hours that you work.\n\nThere should be a gov't agency like \"Wage and Hours\" who regulates employers.\n\nAlso, take a look at the Employee Handbook.  These sources should provide info on what's legal, and what you can do if it's not.\n\nThe other option, if the data collection seems overwhelming, is to GTFO, which needs to happen anyway.", "NTA, you need to leave this job because this guy sounds very toxic or maybe go to the higher ups about his behavior", "NTA and you'd better start looking for a new job as its toxic out there and you are being exploited all the while. You deserve a day off like anyone else and your boss is being a total asshole for asking you not to plan for days off. Find a new job and just walk away if you can afford to as assholes like your boss deserves to be hung dry.", "NTA. Days off are days off. They are exactly the days you should be planning stuff. My employers have called me and asked if I could come in on my days off and most times I say no and they're fine with it. It's never been an issue and they've never suggested I was in the wrong in any way.", "NTA, he\u2019s just an average shitty manager with power trip and focusing only on ; business business and business", "NTA - time off is time off. He\u2019s being an Ass. \nYou can\u2019t twiddle your thumb all day waiting to be called?", "NTA first off. Secondly, you need to check what your labour laws are where you live. Many places have laws/regulations stating that you need to 24 CONSECUTIVE hours off every 5-6 days or 48 every 12-14 days. it varies and I\u2019m trying to do this from memory for my province and it\u2019s early where I am\n\nMany years ago I worked at a grocery store, now I had been there long enough to get 4 weeks paid vacation (almost 11 years) I didn\u2019t usually take it, we just it paid out because I was part time. I just booked weekends off here and there. Onto my story\n\nMy birthday is early May, this year (when the story takes place) it happened to fall on a Saturday (woohoo) my department manager also gave me the Sunday off, (it was my 30th), and because I was on a grandfather contract I didn\u2019t have to work Sundays\n\nI worked the next weekend, third weekend I booked off for a wedding with my boyfriend at the time (it was a three hour drive and we were spending the night)\nFourth weekend we had an extended king weekend trip booked for an event in LA\n\nAbout a week later the store manager confronted me (he was new so he didn\u2019t know better) and told me I couldn\u2019t keep booking weekends off\n\nI lit into him and told him \u201cI am ALLOWED to have a life outside of this job. I am entitled to FOUR weeks vacation, which I NEVER take. I also do NOT have to work Sundays as when I was hired Sundays were still considered a holiday. I almost never call off sick, I just happened to need three weekends off last month.\u201d\n\nHe was stunned to say the least. I took it as my sign to quit. I had wanted to quit for a long time, but once I hit three weeks paid vacation it was harder to walk away from the seniority I had built up. I\u2019d like to say I got a better job and my life is great now. But sadly this is real life and I\u2019m still stuck in a different minimum wage job. Though this boss is very chill and is cool with me knitting/crocheting when it\u2019s not busy\n\nSo the point of my long story is, you\u2019re young, you probably aren\u2019t depending on this money to survive. Don\u2019t waste your time being miserable. Tell the manager to \u201cfuck off\u201d what\u2019s he going to do fire you?  Great. Go get a job some where else. Now is the time to work on growing a spine made of steel\n\nLook into the trades, take any and all shop classes offer at your school. Look into youth apprenticeship programs. I went back to school to learn a trade at 38. I\u2019m now running into the issue of no one wants to hire me because I don\u2019t have experience (and the companies complain that they can\u2019t find workers. They\u2019re choices are \u2018nothing\u2019 or \u2018student\u2019 and they\u2019d rather have nothing and whine about it)\nThere are programs to help folks fine positions in the trades. But they usually cut off at the 25 mark\n\nYou are young, you\u2019re not relying on this money to survive. So tell the manager to fuck off and live your life.", "NTA and file a complaint with HR. Or an harrassment report. He cannot do those things. Days off are not days for him to put you on a shelf so he might use you when he needs you. You are not an elf. He could always ask you to work on your day off and then you could say no and he needs to ask others. Or do the job himself.", "NTA. He has no say over your days off. He is not paying you to be on-call or always available. That's not how it works.\n\nI would advice you to go to your union or HR. His behaviour is not acceptable. If this is not an option, I think you should start looking for another job. 16 is way too damn early to burn out because of a crappy boss", "NTA. \n  \nDon\u2019t answer your phone on your days off. Let it ring and go to voicemail or just silence the call. They will get the hint eventually.", "NTA find another job. Are there no child labor laws in your country?", "NTA.
