I just booked weekends off here and there. Onto my story\n\nMy birthday is early May, this year (when the story takes place) it happened to fall on a Saturday (woohoo) my department manager also gave me the Sunday off, (it was my 30th), and because I was on a grandfather contract I didn\u2019t have to work Sundays\n\nI worked the next weekend, third weekend I booked off for a wedding with my boyfriend at the time (it was a three hour drive and we were spending the night)\nFourth weekend we had an extended king weekend trip booked for an event in LA\n\nAbout a week later the store manager confronted me (he was new so he didn\u2019t know better) and told me I couldn\u2019t keep booking weekends off\n\nI lit into him and told him \u201cI am ALLOWED to have a life outside of this job. I am entitled to FOUR weeks vacation, which I NEVER take. I also do NOT have to work Sundays as when I was hired Sundays were still considered a holiday. I almost never call off sick, I just happened to need three weekends off last month.\u201d\n\nHe was stunned to say the least. I took it as my sign to quit. I had wanted to quit for a long time, but once I hit three weeks paid vacation it was harder to walk away from the seniority I had built up. I\u2019d like to say I got a better job and my life is great now. But sadly this is real life and I\u2019m still stuck in a different minimum wage job. Though this boss is very chill and is cool with me knitting/crocheting when it\u2019s not busy\n\nSo the point of my long story is, you\u2019re young, you probably aren\u2019t depending on this money to survive. Don\u2019t waste your time being miserable. Tell the manager to \u201cfuck off\u201d what\u2019s he going to do fire you?  Great. Go get a job some where else. Now is the time to work on growing a spine made of steel\n\nLook into the trades, take any and all shop classes offer at your school. Look into youth apprenticeship programs. I went back to school to learn a trade at 38. I\u2019m now running into the issue of no one wants to hire me because I don\u2019t have experience (and the companies complain that they can\u2019t find workers. They\u2019re choices are \u2018nothing\u2019 or \u2018student\u2019 and they\u2019d rather have nothing and whine about it)\nThere are programs to help folks fine positions in the trades. But they usually cut off at the 25 mark\n\nYou are young, you\u2019re not relying on this money to survive. So tell the manager to fuck off and live your life.", "NTA and file a complaint with HR.
