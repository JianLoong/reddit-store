We don't see each other as often as we'd like to - we all live in different cities - so it was a great three days of hanging out and catching up, telling old stories etc. All 5 of us are married, so the topic of wives and marriages came up from time to time. \n\nAt one point after a night of drinking the topic of sex came up, and I offhandedly shared that my wife (Sandra) has perfected what I call the \"insane handjob\" which keeps me happy. They asked for detail but I didn't go into it, and kind of forgot about it. \n\nWell, over the coming days, one of the wives (Jenny) texted my wife half-jokingly asking about this \"insane HJ\" technique. My wife asked me what she was talking about, and I came clean that I had mentioned this to the group, and Jenny's husband must have mentioned it to her. Sandra laughed it off, was not bothered.  \n\nSince then Sandra and Jenny have been texting a lot, talking on the phone, seeming to become fast friends. (They only know each other through my friend and me.) They talk about sex a lot.  Jenny is extremely private, my wife is not, and my wife thinks this is kind of a fun outlet for Jenny.\n\nSo, my buddy (Jenny's husband) texted me on Monday, saying he saw Jenny's texts with my wife, and asked if I knew what was going on. I said yes, generally, and he was shocked I was ok with it. He said they are talking about sex a lot, which he thinks is not ok, and asked me to support him and have Sandra cut it out.\n\nI told him to back off, that Jenny and Sandra are grown ups who will make their own decisions. He said if I saw the texts I'd feel differently, and I said I don't need to see them to know I trust Sandra.\n\nAITA?

There is a line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed.\n\nIn all honestly it\u2019s kind of messed up that you shut him down without even asking what about the conversation was making him uncomfortable.

You have no idea if it is justified or not. \n\nYour friend has confided in you that your wives conversations are making him uncomfortable and adding issues to his relationship.
