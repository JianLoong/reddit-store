My house is just a regular one, nothing fancy enough for TV, but it's worth a good chunk of change because of the area it's in. My folks left it to me, along with a couple of other houses I'm renting out. And yeah, I'll admit it, I don't have a regular job.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend is 32 and she's working on becoming a nurse. Right now, she's a nurse's assistant, which is no joke of a job, even though it doesn't pay all that much. She's juggling work and studying, putting in a ton of effort. We've been together for about four years now, and I really care about her.  \r  \n\r  \nShe's got a 13-year-old daughter (turning 14 soon), who has some strong feelings about me. It's not exactly friendly vibes. Almost every day, she's got some not-so-nice things to say about how her mom works and I don't, like I'm just lazy. And she's not shy about making fun of me when we don't see eye to eye on stuff. Apparently, she talks about me to pretty much everyone \u2013 her grandparents, her dad, her friends \u2013 and it eventually makes its way back to their parents, all centered around how I'm making her mom work while I chill. It's a never-ending thing.  \r  \n\r  \nThings took a more concerning turn recently.Over the Summer break, she started acting out physically. She broke a window in my house, my TV, let the air out of the tires on my car and bike, even cracked the screen on my monitor for my PCS. But the last straw was when she let my cat loose in the neighborhood, My cat was adopted and declawed (by the previous owner!) so it was unable to defend itself.  My cat was found a little dinged up thankfully, but that was way over the line for me.  \r  \n\r  \nI told my girlfriend that her daughter had to move out. I was ready to accept that this might end our relationship too. I mean, her being a mom comes first. She asked for more time to try and work things out, explaining that she couldn't just drop her job and studies as it would set her degree back. But I was firm \u2013 I wanted the daughter gone, no more talking. \r  \n\r  \n Here's where things get tricky. The daughter asked if she could go live with her grandparents until her mom finishes school. Everyone was okay with this arrangement. She seemed genuinely excited about it... until school started. Turns out, her grandparents live in a really tough school district. She's been getting bullied there really bad, mainly verbally but even some physical stuff. The bullying has gotten so bad that she can't even go to the local park without ending up in tears after an altercation she had with two other girls. \r  \n\r  \nSo now she's asking to move back in and her mom thinks this might have been the wake-up call she needed to change her attitude. But I'm not budging. Life is peaceful for me now, no more attacks, and I'm just enjoying my life without all the judgment. I mean, she almost got my cat hurt!\r  \n\r  \nSo, am I the AH not letting her daughter move back in?", "created_utc": 1692727101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ydcm1/aita_for_not_allowing_my_girlfriends_daughter_to/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like mother and daughter both FAFO.  You acknowledge that kicking the daughter out is tantamount to ending the relationship and accept the consequences, so NTA.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, and little brat is learning it the hard way. She tried to bully you and the tables have turned. \n\nThis will likely end your relationship, but I wouldn\u2019t sacrifice my mental well being for some rude child that openly despises me.", "Nta\n\n\nShe is old enough to know the destruction of property isn't ok. She is also enough not to harm a poor, defenseless animal.\n\n\nPersonally, I would just end the relationship.  This goes beyond anything else.\n\n\nYou have every right not to have your property damaged or your cat put in harms way.\n\nThat is some sick behavior.", "NTA\n\n I would've kicked her fucking ass out ages ago. Especially after she caused my cat to be hurt and damaged my property.", "NTA but this relationship is not going to work.", "NTA but her mother is. Her mother should have put a stop to her behavior years ago. Also, her daughter learned this behavior from other people. No 10 yr old girl is going to even think twice if you are working or not. This is not going to change because there's a whole lot of people in gf's family saying exactly what she is parroting back to you.\n\nYour gf needs to step up and be a mother. Not your problem any longer.", "NTA but this relationship can't work out in the long run. Your gf's daughter's behavior is atrocious, but she is her daughter, and she's a minor, so she's going to be a big part of your life for as long as you're involved with her mother. If you can't handle that, I certainly won't judge you, but I think the ethical course of action is to end the relationship.", "NTA don\u2019t let the daughter back in, it\u2019s gonna be the same shit again.", "Nta, your gf is an AH for not immediately looking for a new place for her and her daughter. This isn\u2019t for you to fix.", "NTA. She talks to you like dirt has damaged your property and let your cat out, and what is mom doing to parent her child? I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting that kind of behaviour back in your life.", "NTA - Why you want to continue seeing your gf is beyond me. She doesn\u2019t parent her kid and actually chose to send her daughter away.\n\nYour stepdaughter wasn\u2019t the problem, it was your gf.", "NTA, she's probably not getting bullied,  but instead pulling the same shit with them that she pulled with you and everyone else and kids in her new district aren't having it. \n\nYou made it clear to mom if she wanted to end it over this issue that's ok.  This is mom's decision to stay in this  not yours.", "NTA\n\nMe thinks that's not so much bullying, but the consequences of being a bully, either way let the kid deal with the consequences of her own actions", "NTA", "NTA end the relationship", "NTA.  Her behaviour and lack of respect for you and your property has put her in the position she is in.  She had the chance to alter her behaviour before but decided not to.  I would definitely not let her back.  She can go stay with her father (who should take responsibility anyway) if she is having issues.", "NTA. The kid is old enough to know better. Putting the cat at risk was way over the line. You have to protect your cat. GF is in a difficult situation but she needs to find a way to handle it.", "NTA.  It is your home. The daughter\u2019s behavior crossed the line and was completely inappropriate.  Maybe she has gotten a wake up call and maybe she hasn\u2019t.  The thing is your girlfriend should have done more to curb the behavior before it got out of control.  She either didn\u2019t or it wasn\u2019t a solvable problem.  Now she has to deal with the fallout.  \n\nMy take on the situation is that your girlfriend is just using you for a inexpensive place to live until she finishes her degree and can be more financially stable.  At that point, she will probably move out because if she is a good mother, she won\u2019t want to give up her child no matter how awful her daughter is.  Realistically, there is no way for your relationship with your girlfriend to move forward until her daughter is an adult.", "Nta, just from the information you give us, this relationship is not going to work. Do not leave her alone with your cat after the incident, honestly. From you comments your gf and you talk to her about it many times and even did therapy and nothing still haven't worked or changed .\n You understand that her daughter is first priority", "NTA but your girlfriend is.  She has an obligation to take care of her daughter over the relationship with you.", "NTA that kid needs professional help", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is TA for not properly parenting her daughter and for staying in a relationship with someone who is unwilling to parent her child.  She should look for an apartment in a decent district and move there. Pawning a kid off onto their parents is really bad parenting.", "It\u2019s tricky but your gf need to be a mom before a gf. You are not in the wrong for not wanting her back but your gf need to do what\u2019s best for her kid. Anyway, stay firm for your peace. Prepare for whatever happens NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour GF's daughter's behavior was way out of line and it was GF's responsibility to control her daughter. Being around her daughter is unsafe and thus the consequences that they are facing.\n\nIf you let daughter in, make sure that there will be consequences not just to daughter but to GF/grandparents in case of daughter's misbehavior. Perhaps, a collateral for you to hold.", "Can\u2019t she live with her Dad ??", "NTA", "NTA, she ruined so many of your things and put your cat in danger. I would suggest potentially giving her one more chance but it would have to be an ultimatum. If you really want to stay with your partner you will have to probably give her another chance.", "INFO where is the stepdaughters father? Asking to know if he's in her life at all and if her behavior is related to it.\n\nHow does your GF handle these issues? Her daughter has destroyed your belonging in the past and endangered your pet.\n\nHas the daughter apologized to you at all? It may not make sense to talk to her on the phone at the moment but has she apologized to her mom?\n\nIs the daughter in therapy? Has she ever said why she is doing these things?", "NTA", "I think overall this situation is difficult but I would say NTA. Unfortunately you\u2019ve had to come to this decision because she was being aggressive physically and nobody should have to endure that intimidation. You gave your girlfriend the choice to leave you as well because you understand how important being a mother is. However you also need to note that you\u2019re making your gf choose between her relationship with you/career and her daughter. Now she can\u2019t handle being bullied so she wants to move back but it\u2019s clear that unless she gets therapy this behaviour will not change. I think the best thing would be for her to start seeing a therapist and hopefully regain your trust so that she can move in again. She\u2019s dealing with the consequences of her actions and it sucks, but you don\u2019t deserve to feel intimidated by a child in your own home. \n\nAlso, why won\u2019t her dad let her live with him if he\u2019s in the picture?", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for your lifestyle. Good on your parents for setting you up for life and good on you for not blowing a good thing. However, you need to take a moment to be honest with yourself. \n\nDo you have a future with your girlfriend? It\u2019s been 4 years. You know if she\u2019s the one. If she is then marry her and work with her to help her daughter to become a productive person. If not, just cut bait. It\u2019s not fair to you, her, or this girl who sounds like she could benefit from a permanent and positive male role model in her life.\n\nLook, ages 13 - 15 the vast majority of kids are unrepentant assholes who say a variety of horrifying things daily to get a reaction. Be grateful for that, at least they\u2019re talking to you and you get a peek into what they are thinking. It\u2019s the quiet ones who are sneaking around and getting in real trouble. This girl is out of line. A father could help to lovingly bring her in line through a combination of clear consequences mixed with forgiveness and second chances. If you don\u2019t want to do this, cool. End the relationship. But if you have a future with her Mom you can\u2019t just cut the kid out and have everything with the Mom stay just the way you like it. A portion of her happiness, a really good sized portion, is caught up in that kid. Respect that and help with it or leave. \n\nNeither choice is right and both involve some work/pain for you in some degree. Do some soul searching and make the choice that\u2019s right for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She might see you as competition for what little attention she gets from her mom when she\u2019s not at work/school. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s something more serious. \n\nAt the very least she needs more therapy and to be evaluated by psychiatrist. It\u2019s not a one and done thing. It\u2019s not a one year thing. It\u2019s a constant, ongoing thing until the child has worked through their issues. If nothing is changing, switch to another one or another technique. Not all therapists are created equal. \n\nYou\u2019re not her father and it\u2019s not technically your responsibility, but your girlfriend and her moved into your house and one must assume that you were aware of her having a child ahead of time. \n\nIt can be a lot to have a child in your life, especially one that might be acting out. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to deal with that. These are things that should really be thought about before moving in together with a parent and a child\u2026.. BUT maybe it didn\u2019t occur to either of you or maybe there wasn\u2019t an issue before. \n\nEither way if you no longer want to have the child in your house, you should end the relationship your girlfriend. You should not date anyone with kids in the future. Parents and kids are a package deal, you don\u2019t have to take them on if you don\u2019t want to deal with a kid.", "I'm a no judgment on this one. You have a right to want to feel safe and at peace in your home. But I'm not sure how this relationship is going to last. When you're a parent, you can't always send your kid away when they're being an AH. And 13 going on 14 is very literally the beginning of the Horrible Teenager Time. In your situation, you guys have the grands to step in since her dad is deployed, but the responsibility for that child is ultimately on her mom right now. And that means her mom is stuck between asking you to gamble on the possibility that the kid has learned to appreciate what she has and not torture people and leaving her child in a place where she's being bullied. Those are not good options for a parent. You may have to put your cat first, but she as a mom should really be putting her daughter first, and it sounds like that means moving out if you're uncomfortable giving her daughter another chance right now.\n\nIf you're not up for the odd and precarious responsibilities of being a stepparent, you and your gf should probably discuss splitting up right now instead of dragging this out.", "The relationships seem a bit transactional, your girl friend wants to live with you until she finishes school. Her daughter wanted I'm not sure what, a family with gender roles that were conventional. Now she wants the fancier school district. You wanted your girl friend, a quiet life and safety for your cat. \n\nYou are okay with them leaving. It seems like the daughter FAFO and your girlfriend will have to find another place to live while she finishes her degree. The daughter just might have learned an important lesson though.", "I don't blame you one bit.", "Honestly I don't say this much but from what I've read I'd recommend leaving. It seems like you want a chill life with your cat and a casual thing with a girl. This obviously isn't it.", "Why did you downvote me for asking a question? There was nothing there to disagree with. Lol", "Did u read the post ?", "I get that but it might be a way he can keep his gf and his peace too!", "Don't fall for this gaslighting.", "That person is wrong! Keep this kid away from you.", "DO NOT, i repeat DO NOT let this kid around you cat ever again!!! Who gives a rat's ass if she's bullied?? Protect your cat", "I get it, she sounds like a shit. But, you shouldn't be a wedge that comes between your girlfriend and her daughter. \n\nThat doesn't mean you can't speak your mind, but the \"I'm not budging\" is what is putting it into AH territory. Her mom clearly wants her to move back, and you're refusing to listen.\n\nSay the bullying gets worse and she actually gets hurt. Her mom is going to resent you for not letting her get out of that neighborhood.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She\u2019s had a horrible experience.", "Must have been a big TV.  \n\nI still stand by what I said $2000 is unfortunately a drop in the bucket for raising a kid.  Asking a single mom to choose between you and the kid is harsh but fair.  Doing it while the mom is in a financially disastrous situation if she chooses the kid puts a different spin on things.  It is coersive and borderline abusive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not getting on the \"You are totally right OP.\" bandwagon.  You have to remember who is telling the story and read between the lines a bit.  Moving an unemployed student out of section 8 and then making her choose between continued housing and her child is shit, I don't care if the child is having some mild to moderate behavioral problems.", "No, there are people that think the government should own housing and give it to people to live in, instead of it being owned by\u2026anyone?  Like a communist type situation? At least, this is from what I gather. Perhaps others who don\u2019t believe that landlords should exist could be more enlightening", "And then is just okay with her bebopping off to grandma and grandpa\u2019s without so much as a my house my rules ultimatum?  She\u2019s a shitty mom\u2026", "This too.", "Me too. There's no way i'd ever let her put a foot in my house. I don't care if she goes in the worst neighbourhood in america and gets bullied every single day. Honestly fuck her and her mom", "Obviously, the girlfriend intends to move out when she gets her degree since the daughter only moved with her grandparents until she finishes her degree. \n\nWhy should OP wait? He should just break up with her and tell her to move out now. He doesn't owe her anything. And the sooner she's gone, the sooner he can move on.", "I didn't downvote you? It doesn't show on my end anyway! If it did, sorry. I'm not sure how to fix it since, on my end, it doesn't show me voting.", "None of that is OP's responsibility. The mom needs to break up with him and move out so she can parent her daughter.", "That\u2019s entirely her mom\u2019s responsibility.

She didn\u2019t parent the daughter when she lived there, and she\u2019s not doing much as a parent now.

I think she tried to bully those kids and they didn't stand for it", "Then the girlfriend should have raised her daughter to be respectful of other peoples pets,  things and possessions and not been a bully. The girlfriend can still move with the daughter. It's unfortunate circumstances but after 4yrs I'd be hard-pressed to not budge as well.\n\nThe only reason she wants to come back is because she is being bullied and that's probably her attitude that did it.", "He has 2 rental properties.
