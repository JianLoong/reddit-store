She popped her head in to say hey and introduced us.\n\nWell I glance in the office and immediately notice that a picture of my wife is on his wall. I don\u2019t say anything but mention it at lunch. For more context before he was the director him and my wife worked more closely together so they do have a friendly relationship. \n\nMy wife said the picture was an inside joke because his office is right by the printer and bathroom, she said she\u2019d joke that she always feels like she has to say hey when she walks past so they are constantly saying hi. Something like that, she printed a picture of her waving saying that she now doesn\u2019t have to do it anymore. He hung up that picture. He also has a picture of her holding a birthday sign with other coworkers but her face is middle. So really two pictures. He also has other random things hanging up. And a picture of his wife on his desk.\n\nI tried to let it go but I just think it\u2019s weird and bordering inappropriate. Like what are people without context thinking? I explained to her and said it makes me uncomfortable and if she could maybe talk to him.\n\nShe claims that would be making it something it\u2019s not and make work uncomfortable. They\u2019ve never chatted outside of work and have a professional relationship. But I feel like if she won\u2019t talk to him maybe I should.

Yes, YTA but you can stop anytime.", "YTA your wife has a working relationship with this person, is an intelligent woman, has explained the situation to you and asked you not to intervene.

But that isn\u2019t what happened, she printed the picture as a meme, and he hung it up. It\u2019s a joke, and the whole point of the joke is that he has the picture so she doesn\u2019t have to say hi, so it makes even more sense for him to have it hung / out somewhere on display , that\u2019s the butt of the joke.", "\r\"She claims that would be making it something it\u2019s not and make work uncomfortable.\"\n\nShe is correct.

How would you like to have an inside joke with a coworker that was then promoted to your boss, she didn\u2019t like it, and she marched herself to your place of employment to voice her concerns? Would she be in the right or would you consider that so far outside the realm of acceptable behavior that you\u2019d be furious at her?\n\nUse your mind and not your emotions. She\u2019s an adult. She is comfortable enough with those pictures that she brought you into that room, not to start a fight with you, but to meet her friend and she doesn\u2019t even think about them. It\u2019s not creepy or wrong. If there were candles burning around the pictures and a voodoo doll shaped like your wife, you\u2019d have a reason to defend her.

And insecure to boot. Her bringing it up with the boss is awkward and makes a big deal out of nothing. While also making you look insecure and controlling.", "YTA. You should stay out of your wife's workplace altogether if you are uncomfortable and can't control your jealousy. You are creating stories out of nothing, acting as if they are true and then making it your wife's problem to fix. It is absolutely none of your business, what photos her team displays in their own workspace.  Your insecurities are showing.\n\nTalking to her boss at all is insane enough - but since it is explicitly against her wishes - doing so would be an extreme violation of trust, and could very well lead to a dissolution of the marriage altogether. I would not stay married to someone who treated me so disrespectfully.", "YTA.  So...you want to damage her relationship with her boss?", "YTA, reading WAY too far into it.

I found this hilarious. There was a story on Ask a Manager about an intern giving a framed photo of themselves in the white elephant gift exchange. It was proudly displayed and now gets regifted every year a decade later. \n\nCoworkers have inside jokes and do silly things together. You don't get to decide what is appropriate or inappropriate for everyone else. The fact you mentioned a group photo that had your wife centered and have counted it as two photos of your wife is slightly unhinged. Please don't make things weird for your wife at work. It's ok to have pictures of your colleagues in your office or cube, it is common. YTA, leave it be and get therapy if you still don't feel great about it.", "YTA and reading way too much in it. There is an inside joke plus a birthday picture. The boss also has pictures of his wife much closer. Why are you so determined to see something that just isn\u2019t there?", "For goodness' sake. They are work colleagues. Who cares about people who don't know context. They have a joke going.\n\nAre you really so insecure? You need to work on that without upsetting your wife's friends and colleagues.   \n\nYTA", "YTA. People have in jokes. You\u2019re not party to this one. Stop being so insecure and get on with your life.", "your behavior it a total ick. The only person being inappropriate here is you thinking it's your place to have a talk with her boss.

I'm sorry that your feeling got hurt by something I said. It must be hard to cope. \ud83e\udd23", "YTA.\n\nThe initial phrasing of this situation made your wife's boss's office sound like some kind of Stalker Shrine. But it's not. It's a photo your wife gave him as a joke, and a group photo where your wife is part of that group. Nothing nefarious here. Nothing worth worrying about.", "Dude you need to chill. If he was having an affair with her he wouldn\u2019t be dumb enough to splash it across the wall. This is literally out of The Office. YTA.", "YTA - \"has a picture of his wife on his desk\" should have been your first clue that you are over-reacting.  If you talk to her boss about it, you are going to make things really uncomfortable for your wife at work over something that is completely inert. Please, please, please for your wife's sake do not do that. \n\nI've been in this situation before. My coworker's jealous husband got in a fight with her because we were driving together to an out of town conference - he kept calling non stop to check in to make sure nothing was happening. Made the whole trip super uncomfortable and set a bad tone to the rest of our time working together.", "YTA", "Do not, under any circumstance, say something to her boss about a picture on his wall.\n\nIf she was being suggestive or inappropriate in the picture, then I could see having an issue with it.\n\nYou already know, whether you like it or not, we all have a work-life and a home-life. \n\nWork-me is not the same as home-me. We are different people. I have to wear a fake smile, attend meetings, be civil, share a bathroom with 50 other people, and be nice to someone who holds my job, and my future raises and promotions, in their hands. I have to be nice to people I cannot stand. Stinky people. Lazy people. Incompetent people. People of all shapes and sizes and colors and personalities.\n\nWe develop friendships with people we share the majority of the day with, we have inside jokes, department jokes, and they know a side of her you do not, and probably never will. It is who she is outside of the home. Just like they will never know what she is like at home, the jokes and conversations you share, her opinions of people in her office, and when she unloads about her day. You are her partner and she loves you.  If she hasn't given you a reason to not trust her, do not make an issue for her in your marriage and her job because you are jealous.\n\nYou want her to have some friendly-type of relationship with her boss. She will be the first person he thinks of when raises and promotions come up, special projects, etc. \n\nYour wife is not cheating on you and the employer is not making passes at your wife. She explained the photo, thought it was funny, and made it so she doesn't have to have awkward conversations with someone she doesn't want to talk to.\n\nShe cannot help where his office is, and he cannot help where his desk is facing. It faces the hallway and he sees her either coming or going from the bathroom. She is just going to the bathroom, and being courteous to her boss.\n\nYTA (or would be) if you did.", "YTA", "The only one who should give a shit is HIS wife. \n\nIf you trust your wife then all is well.", "One of the least attractive qualities in a partner is jealousy and controlling behavior.

You absolutely should seek out professional help for this jealousy thing. This is so beyond inappropriate and boundary crossing to even think this is the move. There\u2019s absolutely nothing inappropriate about this and it\u2019s pretty hilarious.

And when his brain does similar things I'm there to reassure him too while we both work on our things individually as well, we still support each other through it.
