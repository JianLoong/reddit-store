And it really doesn\u2019t seem like this is where your energy necessarily needs to be focused. I\u2019m guessing maybe you\u2019re upset about not having sex since 2015, but rather than recognizing that that\u2019s where your true frustration lies, you\u2019re misdirecting that anger as: \u201cI give blood and I deserve a bike!!!!\u201d Is that *really* what you\u2019re upset about here?? I\u2019m also noticing your statement that your wife should be grateful for her \u201cfree ride\u201d. If your wife has stayed home to raise six children, the two of you agreed on that decision, and you recognize that she\u2019s \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201can outstanding mother\u201d, is it really fair to now decide that the way the two of you agreed to distribute your labor (working outside of the home vs full time childcare) is \u201ca free ride\u201d?\n\nIn an otherwise happy marriage, a suggestion that one spouse put more money towards a shared dream (retirement and an RV) wouldn\u2019t necessarily be met with that spouse \u201cnearly losing it\u201d, even if they disagreed.

I'd say your justified here", "6 kids!! That\u2019s more than a full time job", "INFO Why did you \"almost lose it\"? Nothing in your post suggests she's on your ass about how you spend or that makes a big deal when you buy things for yourself or anything that would explain to me why you were so angry about it.", "I very much agree with your response in every way. Free ride is a terrible way to phrase the issue. My frustration is mostly that I feel that I am contributing more to the relationship (spousal) than she is. I feel I am upholding my agreed responsibilities but she's only worried about the kids and a happy future for herself. I just feel like she should respect that I am not withdrawing from my responsibility but she is not welcome to any more. You're right, I'm sure, but this felt like a very unreasonable ask.  Thanks for your response.", ">what in the world does your sex life (or lack thereof) have anything to do with the rest of the post? When you brought that up and said you were\n\n\n\nI thought... Frustration?", "I had the same question!

It just felt very unfair at the moment.", "Honestly, this is really a good time to start looking into some form of counseling. I'm not at all saying \"your marriage is on the rocks and you gotta do some sort of deep therapy ASAP\" here, but BeJane759 is absolutely on the right track that you almost certainly aren't actually upset about what you feel like you're upset about right now. We ALL fail to have total self-awareness so that's not to criticize you.\n\nYou actually already took a really healthy step: You realized you might not have a reasonable perspective on the situation and asked for some free and quick advice. That's good. The bad news is this is Reddit... so... I'd really suggest you spend something to get better advice.\n\nThat might be spending cash to get a real counselor and have a sit down yourself. It might be a couples therapist and you both go. It could be just spending time to ask the pastor/rabbi/justice-of-the-peace-dressed-like-Elvis that married the two of you to have a cup of coffee with you and let you talk for a bit.\n\nGood luck man.", "Is this a conversation that you\u2019ve had with her? Because it sounds like there might be some validity to your feelings of frustration, but if they come out as focusing on something else entirely, the main issue won\u2019t actually get addressed.", "Too funny.  Thanks, that helped.  No, what I was trying to convey is that I feel like I am the one always giving and then I find a way to get something for myself without taking from my contribution to the relationship and she wants even that.  It just felt very unfair at the moment.", "It is very likely that she feels the same as a wife and a mother. She is likely also always giving while getting little back. I assume that you have a nice home and a happy family because of the work she does, just like she is financially supported by the work you do. You are both doing your jobs, but now you want something just for you which is reasonable, but don\u2019t you think she also might want something just for her? Being a full time caretaker for everyone in your family is exhausting. It\u2019s always surprising to me that men don\u2019t understand what that does to a woman\u2019s libido. Maybe suggest she start doing something just for her and then you can do your thing just for ypu. Might actually help your marriage", "I agree completely.  Tried to get her to counseling and she told the counselor there was nothing wrong with the marriage.  Since then I feel like a mule pulling a cart.  I guess I was just frustrated that I feel I give as much as I'm able but she found a way to ask for more.  I do think you are right on point, though.  Thanks for the response.", "I understand that. \n\nJust to play the devil\u2019s advocate for a second: what she was suggesting you do with the money was not spend it on her or waste it, what she was suggesting you do with the money was put it towards the shared goal of *your* retirement. So it\u2019s ok if you disagree with her idea, and if you\u2019d prefer to use it for things that bring you joy now vs. something that might bring you joy later, but to be clear, she\u2019s suggesting that you save the money for something *you* actually want to do someday (stop working and buy an RV), right? \n\nMy husband and I have actually had conversations that hover in the realm of \u201cdo we want to make financial decisions that give instant gratification vs delayed gratification\u201dourselves. A common one for us is around the idea of retiring earlier vs taking memorable vacations with our kids while they\u2019re young. So when I read what your wife suggested it, I\u2019m seeing it from that viewpoint and not the viewpoint that she\u2019s trying to take away your joy. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m guessing that there\u2019s something else that\u2019s contributing to your frustration about this, that and the fact that you brought up the lack of sex. Good luck!", "This sounds frustrating. I\u2019m sorry. It sounds like maybe you need to tell her (and the counselor, if you go back), that in fact there *is* something wrong with the marriage.", "When she said that to the counselor, what did you say in response? Did you say that you disagreed and explain what you thought was wrong with your marriage? Are you getting to a point that you might not be willing to remain in your marriage? If so, does she know that?", "The great thing is that you don\u2019t need to do couples counseling, and honestly it would probably be best to do some individually first even if she was open to it. You can talk to someone on your own who can help you figure out exactly what it is that you feel is missing so you can verbalize it to your wife. Also please remember that she has spent her entire adult life as a mother, you still have kids at home. She\u2019s likely gone through menopause. It seems like you two really stuck to your roles in the marriage and now you probably both feel unfulfilled. I bet if you can gain some skills to be able to approach your wife in a way where she can hear your concerns you can really improve your marriage. You k ow your wife best, but could she be saying everything is fine because being an amazing wife and mother is a big part of her identity? Sometimes it is hard to admit negative things because we feel that it shows we have failed. Even if your wife never can work with you on this, doing therapy on your own can help you decide if that is something you can live with and how.", "And did you say yes, there is something wrong with our marriage, you just refuse to acknowledge it.", "I told my wife and the counselor that if one person in the relationship is having a problem then there is a problem.  My wife and the counselor said I was wrong and there is nothing wrong so I need to just keep keeping on.  I emotionally left the marriage many years ago but I will not be leaving.  I can't stand what divorce does to families, even with grown children.  Since things are almost certainly beyond repair I don't bring it up because it causes too much pain.  There's a tolerable quiet.  I just broke over this thing, didn't say anything, just had a weak moment.  Moving on now.", "Very thoughtful reply. Thank you.  Honestly, I feel smothered and I'm certain she gets defensive for exactly the reasons you describe.  To be sure, I have contributed at least equally to the dysfunction.  Her mission was motherhood, all other things secondary.  Therapy?  Certainly good advice, but therapists are like a box of chocolates... Honestly, I'm mostly just numb to it all now.  So this sudden flair up inside kind of shocked me.  I've got my mind right now.  I am surprised by how thoughtful most people have been in the comments.  Remarkable in this age of trolls.", "You know you don't have to accept this, right?  You deserve happiness.", "If a counselor told you that, then that counselor was wrong.", "You\u2019re numb to it bc you\u2019ve numbed yourself to it, burying your feelings. Those feelings are still there, which is how they were able to flare up like this when she asked for some thing you perceived, as being over the line.\n\nA good therapist could help you overtime make a plan for your future that gives you more things to look forward to, and could help you reach a place of more inner peace about the way your life is if you and you don\u2019t want to change anything about it. Since income is not an issue, I would suggest that you employ a Psy.D or Ph.D in psychology (a psychologist) rather than an LPC/LMHT/LMFC/LCSW (licensed therapists, who only need a two year master\u2019s degree).\n\nA good psychologist almost certainly will be expensive and not take insurance. And there are lots of good masters-level clinicians out there, I\u2019m not knocking them! It\u2019s just that you can afford a top-level psychologist with the best training, and that makes it more likely you\u2019ll get someone helpful on the first try instead of having to try several clinicians to find a good fit.\n\nEither way, look for someone who has quite a few years of experience as a therapist, and I think looking for someone who lists Cognitive Behavioral Therapy expertise is likely a good fit for you. YMMV of course.", "Firstly I just want to say it\u2019s really great to see someone being so reflective and self aware on a thread on the internet. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this frustration and wanting to improve a situation but not being heard. \n\nWith regards to therapists, whilst there can be a period of finding the right one, talk therapy can be a really useful tool for being able to articulate your priorities, and how you are feeling, and sometimes a therapeutic relationship can be useful even if short and you end up finding you need a different approach after a while. Coming up with a few questions to ask to see if they are the kind of person you\u2019d gel with can help too. I know plasma donation can have some downtime associated whilst you\u2019re actively hooked up to the machine so that could be some good time to make a list of questions/read about the various kinds of approaches therapists have to see what you might like and can search for?\n\nIn terms of the \u201cdry\u201c nature of your marriage, I think you might find Dr. Emily Nagoski P.h.D\u2019s \u2018Come as You Are\u2019 interesting - whilst it\u2019s main audience it is speaking to people socialised as women, it\u2019s a fascinating read and might help you see insights into how you and your partners functioning of desire/arousal might be different - and perhaps where a deprioritisation of emotional intimacy within the relationship (which can happen if there is a strong focus on kids, running household and/or bringing in income as the main functions of the people in the relationship, it\u2019s very common) by you both may have occurred and particularly had an impact on your wife\u2019s experience of desire, or perhaps other factors: the way the typical biological male neural pathways and the female ones differ in how they operate on average in this regard. You may find it interesting as something that may help you understand your wife. I do not mean to say you or your wife needs \u201cfixing\u201d by psychology but rather these tools might help you discuss wants and needs by having words and tools to actively identify them. \n\nWishing you all the best."]}
