So yesterday my girlfriend told me Amy (fake names) was planning on leaving Zak, my friend because of his past infidelity. I don't agree with his past infidelity, but when my girlfriend told me that Amy was planning on leaving by clearing out the bank accounts and blocking him, I got concerned for my friend's wellbeing. She asked me not to tell Zak, but I told her that since she dropped this situation on my lap, she'll have to handle my reaction. So today I told Zak Amy's plan and advised him to take half the money from the joint accounts so he isn't left with nothing and to find a lawyer promptly.\n\nHe quickly went from distress to anger as I told him. Turns out he left work earlier and took out half the money from the joint accounts. Amy is furious as they weren't in a good financial state to begin with and she was planning on using the money to move across the country back home to her family. Apparently, she also wanted to avoid conflict and just wanted everything to be done through lawyers and was incredibly upset to go home to an angry and distraught spouse when she wasn't ready. \n\nMy girlfriend says that it wasn't my place to interfere and she told me in confidence. I told her she couldn't drop a bomb like that on me about my friend while I watch him get screwed over. I don't agree with what he did, but I don't think he deserves to potentially not be able to feed himself if she takes all the joint money. She says I don't understand the pain Amy has been feeling, but I think that still doesn't justify that level of revenge. Yes he messed up, and the relationship ending is his fault, but there's a process for that that wasn't Amy's plan. Things are pretty icy between us now and she says she struggles to trust me. I personally think I did the right thing by my friend. AITA? \n\nI think I might be the asshole because I told Zak completely upending Amy's plans and violating my girlfriend's trust. Personally, I think I did the just thing.

Clearing the bank accounts and taking ALL of the money should not be advised, taking half is what my mom was told to do in both of her divorces, by her actual LAWYER. The courts look into your finances when you divorce. Wherever you see someone telling an abuse victim to screw themselves over, protect that victim by telling them not to screw themselves as the court decides hours much of whatever they take right before the divorce is actually their, and that taking ALL the money could lead to them having to pay their abuser back.

Where did I say that?? \n\nI don\u2019t think either spouse should do that.

He may now have to testify in court. His friend could be brought up on charges. Both spouses will be in a worse place bc the whole thing will be heavily litigated and divorce attorneys aren\u2019t cheap.

So yeah\u2026 I think he\u2019s the asshole. \n\nAnd as I brought up as a hypothetical, if the wife was being abused and was trying to get away and he made it more complicated for her, it\u2019s an absolute dick move. Most women try to leave unsuccessfully 7 times before they can escape their abusers. It takes 7 times on average to leave. That\u2019s also the most fatal time.

What\u2019s going on in their relationship is not your business. You shouldn\u2019t be making it your business. Your girlfriend was talking to you in confidence and Amy (and anyone else for that matter) doesn\u2019t have to explain herself to you. It\u2019s not your relationship to manage. You assume you know what\u2019s going on, and why, and that your input is necessary or helpful. You don\u2019t know any of that. If he is owed that money, the court will award it in the settlement. Unless you happen to be a judge or an attorney of one of these parties, maybe it\u2019s not for you to concern yourself with. Bit of a hero complex in this comment tbh. No one asked for you to save the day.", "But you may have convinced him to commit a crime by cleaning out half of the bank account. \n\nAnd if the wife is being abused it\u2019s not on your gf to say anything, esp when you\u2019ve shown yourself not to be trustworthy. Lots of abuse victims don\u2019t say anything. You made this way more complicated for everyone involved because it made *you* feel better. \n\nIf she went through with her plan, she would have been caught. Now it\u2019s more complicated for everyone, you may be called to testify, Zak may have committed financial crimes (under your instruction), it will be litigated to death, and they\u2019ll both be poorer because good divorce attys are hella expensive. \n\nAre you seeing why your gf thought you should mind your own yet?", "Similar point have been brought up regarding dv and leaving being the most dangerous time to leave and biggest risk for homicide. You guessed it. Downvoted to hell.", "I get that, but a heads up that clearing the bank account could have legal ramifications would've been the better approach. It may not have worked, but at the same time, he would have had proof of the bank status regardless, and would've gotten money back in the divorce. He had what was coming, and wouldn't have been left destitute, but he would've had to work for the money back. Again which he deserves.", "I'm sure that every single guy who is friends with someone who hits their wife/girlfriend would tell you their buddy is a great guy who would never do that.  Abusers are very good at making themselves super likeable to everyone around them.", "Idk, Amy was planning on totally financially ruining him (big AH move, even if he did cheat). I don't think it's a bad thing to question the person that was seemingly okay with that, where as OP has clearly stated that he did not support his friends actions.", "He didn\u2019t \u201cstay loyal\u201d and they both mutually decided as a couple to continue to befriend both of them. I feel as if many are skipping over the \u201cpast\u201d part of the infidelity and acting as if it was recent. OP\u2019s friends made the conscious decision to continue on in the relationship in-spite of the infidelity. While it\u2019s more than fair that her emotions and views changed, as no one should stay in a relationship they don\u2019t feel is not conducive to them. As the facts are presented, draining money from a JOINT account and disappearing into the night is not ok by any means. As presented we are not taking about a DV case and there is no way that any lawyer would have applauded her essentially stealing to fund a getaway. He should look at his girlfriends character/judgment if she feels such actions were appropriate! NTA", "OP and partner aren't married, and choosing to divorce someone and taking all the joint money out of your accounts is upending your own life lol, there was no crisis that forced her hand into that behavior.\n\nThe cheated on wife could have initiated divorce proceedings like regular people. I'm fairly certain it's illegal to take all of the money out of joint marriage accounts and then run, but I'm not a lawyer so", ">you should have counseled you left gf to counsel her to change her mind.\n\nI agree. Talking to gf to talk down the wife would have been the best option for all involved. Hindsight tho.", "Comments from the OP say it was about a year ago that the cheating happened, and just now that the wife is deciding to cut all ties and take all the money.", "I mean it\u2019s literally stealing money, which is illegal. If anything he helped her by not making it so she could screw herself over like that.", "Let\u2019s say the wife takes all the money and splits. Yes, the husband will have the paper trail to prove he is owed. That will take months, possibly years to get back. In the meantime husband will lose everything.\n\nIf we take OP\u2019s word that the husband only took his share then he did the right thing. Husband is a shitty cheater, but that doesn\u2019t make him abusive. Assuming OP\u2019s wife would have filled him in if so", "This was my first thought as well. Most DV murders happen when she tries to leave. Even if he was \u201conly\u201d financially abusing or coercive controlling her, this move on her part would make perfect sense.", "Right, so what you are saying is even if there is no evidence of abuse a woman should be allowed to clean out every bank account and leave without actually having a conversation, worse, she can tell every one of their friends and everyone just has to sit silently until after it occurs because\u2026..ya never know. \n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous, you know you are being ridiculous. I\u2019m sorry if you were abused or knew someone who was, but not every man is abusive and sometimes people just suck. Yes he cheated but they said it was in the past, which means he thinks they are working on their marriage, clearly that\u2019s not happening", "Why are you trying to make up a false narrative? You\u2019re assumptions are absurd.", "You clearly don't know what you're talking about.\nA joint account means both parties have access to it and put money towards it, it doesn't mean one party has full claim over all the money in it. The only one committing a crime would've been the wife if she went through with it as she's essentially stealing the husbands money which would've most likely bitten her in the ass during the divorce.", "You forgot to include women. Source is myself as I was married to an abusive women before I upped and left. An added Bonus was that she also tried to steal all the money from our joint account but failed. \n\nBut you are right in your assessment about abusers wearing masks. To the outside world , she was the perfect woman, behind closed doors She was wishing my family dead so she could take my inheritance.", "He never said his friend hits wife so how does that relate ?", "I think \u201cfinancially ruining\u201d is a bit of a stretch. Because it doesn\u2019t sound like they had much money to begin with. \n\nWas she planning on taking off with $50,000 or was it $5,000 or maybe even $500?\n\nI", "Idk would either of them have listened? if anything I think the most likely outcome of that conversation would be the wife bringing forward her plans and emptying it regardless.", "Depends on the laws where they live.", "If the accounts are joined, both have access legally. I could imagine that they're not able to steal this money because it belongs to both of them.", "Yes, let\u2019s make up entire stories and different ways he\u2019s abusing her\u2026..with absolutely zero evidence", "They always make up these scenarios.", "The point, and the comment that you replied to, was that women will break things off by disappearing instead of breaking off in person because they are afraid of men becoming violent.  You implied the OP knew his friend wouldn't do that.  BUT - abusers often have their friends convinced that they are fine upstanding dudes who would never hit their wife.  The OP thinking that his friend would not hit his wife is not proof positive that the friend would not hit his wife.  The only person who's judgment matters here is the wife and if SHE is afraid he will become violent.  \n\nI am not saying that the friend has or would beat his wife.  The point is that when a woman judges that a situation calls for disappearing instead of just breaking off that she knows better than you how safe she is at home, and by telling the husband she is leaving before she goes that you are risking her experiencing violence because you couldn't keep your mouth shut. \n\nThe money does change this situation- but the OP needs to be more aware of the fact that a lot of women have to balance 'ending a relationship nicely' with the possibility they could be hurt or killed.  Whenever you tell a guy that his partner is going to leave him without telling him there is a solid chance she is worried about some form of abuse that he has now opened her up to.  'I don't think my buddy would do that' doesn't mean jack shit.", "Tbh, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the amount that matters, rather that it\u2019s his entire savings gone without any warning. I don\u2019t know about you, but if my savings just disappeared, I\u2019d be screwed.", "Don't think of a fixed amount rather a percentage. As it doesn't matter if it's 500/5000/50000 point is they don't have a lot and she wanted to clear him of all the money. She wanted 100% of it, and now she gets to have 50% of it.", "What is that logic. If they had more money he would be less ruined since he then earns more. If he doesn't have much money he obviously has less earnings so it fucks him over more.", "Mm. Fair point. For OP, it might have been the better option, since morally he\u2019s tried to do *something*, but also didn\u2019t break the confidence of GF. Tough situation all around.", "Most judges take it VERY poorly, to say the least. She may well have found herself with nothing.", "It\u2019s considered a joint asset, taking it right before the divorce means it\u2019s still factored in with the divorce settlement. Both have access legally, yes, but that money also belongs to BOTH parties.", "No offense but people on this sub act so childish and stupid sometimes. No one is saying he is a abusing her. They are presenting a situation in which her actions make sense and pointing out that OP *doesn\u2019t* know the specifics and made a decision without considering all possibilities. As a result, he stuck his nose where it didn\u2019t belong, without having all of the information. This makes him the AH because unless you know everything about someone\u2019s relationship (hint: you never do) stop involving yourself because there are plenty of situations where you could be wrong or even get someone killed. \n\nTeenagers and very young adults (which is most of reddit) always think they know everything and have the moral high ground because they see things in this very black and white way. They\u2019re usually wrong and immature. It\u2019s okay, that\u2019s part of being young. Unfortunately when you apply that to other people\u2019s relationships, you\u2019re an AH.\n\nIf you prefer another example, let\u2019s say that OPs friend actually gambled away $2,000 a month ago and that\u2019s part of why Amy wants a divorce and she\u2019s trying to protect funds that are mostly hers. Do we know that didn\u2019t happen? No. Does OP? No. Mind your business.", "Ehh\u2026 \n\nI really do think it depends just because some people can\u2019t even afford to have savings.", "Actually, this is how gossip works, he\u2019s not bound to not tell the husband, the wife shouldn\u2019t have told him. She\u2019s the one who betrayed the trust \n\nDon\u2019t want your secrets told, don\u2019t tell people who will tell people", "When you have very little or no savings, someone emptying half your bank account could financially ruin you", "Or people could actually be trustworthy and not AH and stop gossiping? Enjoy your rationalizing, but I\u2019ll be decent person instead. It\u2019s really easy to not try to involve myself in other peoples relationships and be a decent friend.", "If the situation were reversed every one would be hailing him as a hero for telling the wife the husband was going to leave her penniless", "Omg this phrase should literally be banned on this sub. Shut up with the thought terminating cliche. It\u2019s not an argument, it\u2019s you pretending to point out a hypocrisy you have no evidence to support and that I have not displayed. Show me where I have made a different statement on a similar case where the roles have been reversed. I\u2019ll wait. I haven\u2019t. So no, if the roles were reversed I would not have a different statement. Statistically, leaving a marriage is more dangerous for women than men, but I don\u2019t believe in sticking your nose in other peoples relationships. I don\u2019t care what sex you are.
