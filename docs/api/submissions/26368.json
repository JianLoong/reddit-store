I chose two of my cousins (both female) and my best friends (also female) to be my bridesmaids. I didn't ask my sibling (26NB) and now they're hurt and lashing out at me. \n\nThe reason why I didn't ask them is that my sibling and I have a pretty complex history when it comes to gender.\n\nMy sibling, prior to coming out as NB, was incredibly misogynistic. They hated all things feminine, only had male friends and would go out of their way to mock me for doing anything that was within what society would call the traditional female gender role (e.g. baking, make up, wearing a dress etc.). I recognise now that it wasn't about me, it was them expressing their dissatisfaction with their own biological sex by lashing out, but it was incredibly hurtful for me growing up. They always treated me like I was an inferior person for \"submitting to my own oppression\".\n\nThey never apologised, but after coming out as NB in our 20s, they've calmed down on being outright hostile about feminine things, and we get along now. But I do walk on eggshells around them (avoiding fight-triggering topics) and keep them on an information diet about my life. \n\nGiven our history, when planning my bridal party came around, I figured it was obvious that I wouldn't ask them. I didn't want to handle drama with them over every \"patriarchal\" tradition, and also all my other bridesmaids were women, so I could already foresee the potential \"you're not respecting my gender by asking me to partake in this feminine ritualised manifestation of patriarchal expectations\". \n\nWell, it turned out they were actually hoping to be my bridesmaid and patch things up with me? And now they're upset that I never asked them, I just assumed they'd be mad if I asked them. Honestly, I feel really fucking confused and disorientated because every other experience I had with them indicated they'd be offended if I asked them.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for assuming they'd say no and not asking my sibling?", "created_utc": 1694080566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cbqoo/aita_for_not_asking_my_nb_sibling_to_be_my/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wedding isn't a family therapy session. You choose bridesmaids that will support you and enjoy your day with you. Why would you invite your sibling that you're not that close with. If they want to patch things up, maybe they should have reached out and talked to you instead of waiting to see if you passed their little test", "NTA.\n\nYou can chose whoever you want, even a man, to be a bridesmaid. And being a bridesmaid is no way to \"patch things up with\" you.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, I'd not add them to the wedding party at this time. You've just STARTED planning and they are starting the  drama ALREADY.\n\nListen, someone trying to mend their relationship  with you takes accountability  for  their previous shitty actions with a sincere  apology like, \"I'm so sorry for  being so misogynistic growing up. I was super confused and took it out  on you and  there  is just no excuse for that. I am really sorry and I hope  you can forgive  me at some point.\"\n\nBecause people who are contrite offer their apology, WAIT for  the person wronged  to accept or not... and they  don't try to FORCE the reconciliation on their timeline  because they wait for the wronged person to be ready. And they can be hurt  that it's taking more time then they thought it would/should/could, but they DO NOT add more shitty  fuel to the  fire by  acting out in this way.\n\nYour NB  sibling is still making it all about them. All the time. Before  your wedding, probably during and after YOUR wedding   as well.   \n\nIf your NB sibling hasn't taken steps to repair your relationship, you SHOULD hold them at a distance. They have proven they can't be trusted when they are  confused, in pain, or in way feeling discomfort, like being left out of a wedding party.\n\nKeep this in your mind.\n\nBecause if you want to use this wedding- please don't but if  you do  (I just see more drama til the honeymoon and after even)- to repair your  relationship  with your NB sibling even though I think THEY should be the ones taking these steps, then  tell them they aren't a bridesmaid, but that you carved out  a new role for them. And then make something up. Like if  they play  music, have them play  something. Or if they do art, have them do that. Etc. Etc.\n\nLast note: it is never the victim of bullying and misogyny to make things better. It's on the bully, if they've truly  changed. I just wanted to say that again to you.", "NTA. Based on your history and that you are not a mind reader. Now you know, you can act accordingly and see where that goes. It is your wedding and it should be drama free regardless.", "NTA, based on your sibling's history, it's completely fair to assume that they'd react the way you expected them to. If they wanted to be a bridesmaid, the onus is on them to let you know that they'd be happy to do it specifically because of your guys' history.", "NTA. Have they ever apologised for their behaviour? If they want to have a closer relationship with you, they need to take responsibility for the past. Their personal struggles do not give them the right to treat you poorly.", "NTA.\n\nThey were very immature then, and continue to be so now. \n\nThey have mocked, ridiculed, and essentially bullied you for years, without ever apologising, and now are shocked that you feel uncomfortable around them and didn't ask them to be in your wedding party. But you should ask yourself, what have they done for you? How have they contributed positively to your life at all? And why should you cater to someone who is being self-centred and childish to a disgusting degree when they should instead be hyping you up for your wedding and giving you support?\n\nCongrats on your wedding OP, I sincerely hope you have a lovely day.", "Nta, looks like fucked if you do, fucked if you don't.

While traditionally bridemaids are women, I would've included you. But we are not close. And especially regarding this particual tradition plays into why we aren't close. I would love to patch things up with you over time and we can talk about steps to achieve this, but you hurt my feelings for a long time and while understand you had your reasons, doesn't change that we aren't close and you never really reached out to get close. bridespeople are people close to the bride. So, if you like to get closer again, let me know, but you wont be in my bridelparty.\"", "Your sibling sounds utterly exhausting. I wouldn\u2019t be asking them either tbh if I was you.

They were an asshole to you for so many years simply because you were a woman.  Now they are nonbinary it makes it all ok?  Nah mate tell them fuck off", "NTA. You can make bridesmate whoever you want. Also, maybe one should patch things up vefore expecting to become BM?", "NTA. I can completely understand why you wouldn\u2019t want them as your bridesmaid after they basically hated on you for being feminine and enjoying feminine things before", "NTA, they had years of a patterned behaviour that you were going off on, what indicators did they give they wanted to fix things between you two beyond not going into debates with you.", "Hell no. They bullied you growing up. Just because they're your sibling doesn't make them entitled to being your bridesmaid. No matter their gender identity. Especially not with how they treated you and never making up for it or apologizing for it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA they sound draining to be around and I totally understand why you wouldn't want them to partake. That and words, backed up by actions, cannot be taken back and they clearly don't see, or indeed want to take responsibility for that. Its completely natural you feel the way you do, it's cause and effect of their behaviour. That aside, congratulations and all the best for your big day.", "NTA. This feels like a \"damned if you do damned if you don't situation.\" It's likely your sibling would have gotten mad regardless of what you did. You aren't a mind reader. You were going based off of your siblings known behavior.\n\nAnd they said they were hoping that being your bridesmaid would patch things up with you but then they immediately chose to block you. And personally I don't think it's fair of them to put the brunt of repairing the relationship onto you when they are the reason the relationship deteriorated in the first place.", "You can't spend your wedding day tiptoeing around one person just in case they have a hissy fit.  NTA", "And have they made any attempt to patch things up? Far from it, it appears.\n\nIt's bs. Don't be fooled.\n\nTell them the reason you didn't ask them was they have never been anything other than rude, offensive, bullying etc etc and so you had concluded that they hate you and the feeling is mutual.", "NTA Flat out ask what about your sibling's past behavior makes being in your very traditional wedding party on the table as a tempting option. You don't have the relationship of support and closeness in such matters that you should expect from your bridal party. I take it your sibling isn't really even your friend. Blood ain't enough. Behavior matters. Bonds matter.", "NTA. For some reason this reminds me of the pregnant woman with the MTF friend who insisted she be allowed at her birth because she would never know the joys of childbirth. When the pregnant woman rightly said no, the transgender friend accused her of transphobia and sent flying monkeys to berate her for denying her her \"birth experience.\"\n\nFor me, an element of public display creates a subtext for your sibling's desire to be bridesmaid, and frankly you should continue to refuse. This is about a day in the Sun for sibling, not about sharing your day and showcasing you.\n\nFurthermore, they have done nothing to make any kind of amends to you. If you're still walking on eggshells with them, how different can they be despite their new gender orientation?\n\nHold your ground and even uninvite them if necessary. This is your day. I would also think about at least going LC with them.", "NTA, if they really wanted to and is really sincere in patching things up, they would have volunteered and not feel entitled to just wait and expect you to ask them.", "NTA. Your sibling seems to want you to be the one to reach out when they\u2019re the one that caused the rift and should apologize for how they treated you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong in assuming they wouldn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid.", "NTA why would anyone take someone they don't get along with as a bridesmaid's", "NTA\nYour wedding so you get to choose everything that's related to your wedding. While it sucks that they're pissed  and maybe subtle mention of that party with them just to check if they would be interested about it wouldn't hurt.", "NTA, OP don't make them part of your bridal party.

NTA", "NTA. \n\nSo let me get this straight, they thought being a bridesmaid would fix things between you, but they didn't do any work *beforehand* to apologize for the hostile environment they made growing up? They don't get a free pass into your wedding party because they're a sibling.\n\nYou don't have to be the one to start mending this fence. You weren't the one that destroyed it in the first place.", "NTA\n\nThey treated you like shit growing up.

You don\u2019t trust them. You don\u2019t need to include them in a very personal event - you should be able to spend your wedding just being you and not having to self monitor everything you do. \n\nYou do not need to cater to them.

They never apologized, never took responsibility for their past actions and never even actually made clear to you that it was their dysphoria that made them act out, have never done anything to clarify even where they stand now. If they are upset, they should be upset with themselves for never attempting to fix the relationship that their actions damaged. You don\u2019t get to excuse treating people like garbage with the fact that you were going through a difficult time.

This is nothing to do with gender but with having people around you who make you feel good.", "NTA.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s time for you two to have an honest conversation about their past behavior, and how it continues to affect your relationship. They owe you an apology and some honesty about how/why their views and feelings have changed. You owe *them* honesty about how they made you feel, and why you were reluctant to include them in your bridal party.

If they wanted to mend the bridge they need to make the first move. \n\nIf you let them in your wedding party they will only stress you out and upset you. I highly doubt that they would agree to wear the outfit you choose for your bridesmaids. \n\nCongratulations on the engagement \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. It\u2019s not wrong to choose a happy choice in avoiding drama when planning your wedding. Hope you have a wonderful celebration and your sibling understands this is about celebrating you and your partner, not an opportunity to make up for being a crappy sibling.", "NTA, this person sounds like a nightmare tbh. Especially considering that you haven't mentioned them ever apologizing for being toxic when they were younger. \n\nChoose bridesmaids that will support you and make your wedding great, don't let anyone sabotage it just because you feel bad about leaving them out.", "NTA-  If you are going to have bridesmaids, then they should be the people that you choose. It's your call to make, and you don't have to justify or explain your choices. If your sibling chooses to take this as some sort of grave insult, that's not on you.\n\nIf they press the issue, be honest. You didn't think they'd even appreciate the offer. Maybe this will lead to the deeper discussion that will allow you to stop walking on eggshells around them. It doesn't mean that they should be invited to be a bridesmaid, but at least you will possibly gain a better understanding of one another.\n\nEDIT a typo", "Nta, you should only have ppl be your bridesmaid you feel comfortable around. Does not sound like that with your sibling", "NTA - you've been given every reason in the past to avoid bringing up things remotely associated with gender roles, and your wedding is not a therapy or bridge-building session. It's a celebration for you and your partner sharing life together. If your sibling wanted to make up... there have been years available to do that.", "NTA. All you can tell them is that you thought they would be offended to be asked based on a near-lifetime of vocal objections to all things feminine. You thought you were honoring them for who they are by not asking.  It was not your intention to hurt them.\n\nYou can tell them that you are certainly open to \"patching things up\" - that isn't contingent upon them being in the bridal party.  Is there some other role that you can create for them?", "Nta it is your wedding. You are not required to include a sibling or anyone else. Your choice.   You are doing nothing wrong.  Sib is a jerk and very self centered.  Not your problem. Refuse to engage on this topic. Make it clear it is your wedding and your choice. State you will not discuss it again and walk away.", "NTA.\n\nI hope I'm not being offensive to anyone, but does your sibling have a preference in how they present, gender-wise? Assuming your bridesmaids will be wearing dresses, would your sibling be ok with that?\n\nI agree with other comments that it's perhaps not the right forum to repair your relationship, but do you even want that? Or are you ok with the level of relationship you have now? Honestly, walking on eggshells all the time to make sure you don't say something triggering to them would be *exhausting*!\n\nIf you decide to include them in your wedding, maybe you could carve out a special role for them instead? Where they could have an outfit unique to them?  I've been to a couple of weddings where, instead of flower girls, they have an adult filling that role, and they OWN it! Dancing, strutting down the aisle, tossing flowers where they like, it sets the tone for a fun celebration! That's just one thing that springs to mind.\n\nGood luck, I'm sure your wedding will be beautiful no matter what you decide.", "Lol NTA, you had a reasonable expectation of their reaction based on their past behavior and history. Maybe if they try to not be shitty, and work toward repairing your relationship, it can be better in the future. Or they can be salty and pout.", "NTA Given the information you had already gathered throughout your entire lives, it obviously would have been disrespectful to ask them to be a bridesmaid. How were you supposed to know this look out had suddenly changed? Also, as someone else pointed out, maybe your sibling still would have reacted negatively if you did ask.", "NTA, but if you want a relationship with this person, you need to sit down and have a discussion.  You need to let your sibling know all of the hurt they caused you growing up, how fearful you are around them and how their prior responses to anything remotely traditional has been met with anger by them.  Also, them 'hoping' for something will never make it happen.  They have a mouth that they have absolutely no problem complaining with, they should also use it to tell you want they want or desire.  If your sibling doesn't immediately apologize and promise to do better; it's time to go either LC or NC.  It isn't healthy for you or your new life.  Sometimes you just have to turn the page in your book of life.", "NTA\n\nBut IF you are feeling regrets like you want to be inclusive, maybe ask your sibling to do a reading or be an usher or in charge of the wedding book or something gender neutral.", "NTA being i your bridal party isnt a way to patch things up. they can begin the healing process before the wedding if they want to patch things up", "NTA\u2026you are not close to your sibling.  Does not matter the reason why.  Bridesmaids are usually your closest friends.  It is also not a time to patch things up.", "I think you\u2019re missing part of the motive for your sibling\u2019s hostility. They want to lash out at you and want to make you, specifically, feel upset. If you had invited them to be a bridesmaid, you\u2019re right, that would make them upset. The dresses will irritate them. The day. The weather. They want to complain about things when they are not 100% in control.", "NTA, their attitude shows that he was right, they want to create drama and attract attention", "NTA. It's your wedding, even without all the history you still have a right to decide who is a part of your wedding. OP, I would maybe tell them everything you stated here, especially the part about you worrying that you asking them to be a bridesmaid would offend them due to their past comments about stuff. You want a \"traditional\" wedding. If you asked them, would they be okay with that? Would they wear a dress, or would they make a stink about it? Defo needs to be a convo with them.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nThere's emotional baggage. It's not your responsibility to use your wedding to make your sibling feel happy about x, y, or, z. It wasn't even something you could have reasonably anticipated this sibling wanted.\n\nTell your sibling, that you are happy to work on your relationship with them outside the wedding. The wedding isn't the time or place to suddenly have the kind of relationship you never had before. If sibling thinks that it HAS to be the wedding and nothing else will do, then it is clear the sibling is not ready to work on much at all.\n\nWhatever the case, it seems very wise of you to keep sibling out of the wedding - they are already bringing their drama $hit to it. It should just confirm for you that your decision was the right one.", "NTA but you migiht want to explain to your sister that you had no idea that they had an olive branch in mind, that you wish they'd said something sooner. \n\nMaybe meet for coffee and have a heart to heart talk for both of you to explain your feelings.  That is, if you think you can do this without causing even more hurt on both sides.", "NTA", "NTA. They're doing this all to make things about them. If they can't be humble enough to step aside for your wedding, then they probably shouldn't be invited.", "NTA. And you can better your bottom dollar that the sibling will find a way to make the day all about them. Some people just love a bit of drama.", "NAH. This is a family communication issue, not whether or not someone is an AH. I hope you can work things out with your sibling.", "NTA, by what you've said I would have thought the same, they'd be annoyed if you did ask them, being a bridesmaid is after all a pretty feminine thing to do. Relationships with people who you have to walk on egg shells around are so draining", "No one ever said you need to have siblings in your wedding party. If there is that much unresolved drama going on, why would you ever ask them? NTA as you wanted supportive people around you on your wedding day. \n\nIf you're not concerned with your sibling acting out of spite, you could always ask them to say a short speech or participate in a different way. Otherwise, leave it be. I say this as someone who made a similar decision and kept my own sibling and SIL out of our wedding party for our own valid reasons.", "NTA but you two need to talk things out. They had their own issues and unfairly took it out on you. You are basing your decisions on their past behavior because they haven\u2019t told or shown you they now feel differently about the subject. There\u2019s also the pain they caused you and not apologizing for it. \n\nIf you want a relationship, then tell them you do want to patch things up, but it will have to be in baby steps, not a giant brides person leap. Like a once a month sibling date. Treat it like two strangers trying to get to know each other.", "If they were serious about patching things up, they would also understand OP\u2019s perspective and accept that fixing a relationship takes time as well.", "It is also possible that had you asked, sibling might indeed have reacted the way you expected. There are some people with whom you cannot win - whatever you do, it's the wrong thing.\n\nBig family events are very poor forums for reconciliations. That is better done one on one in a quiet, non stressful setting.", "Yes - if they actually want to patch things up that doesn't mean 'wait for the other person to do something nice for you' that means 'go out of your way to do something nice for the other person'.  They can be supportive of your wedding without judgment, not be just be a touchy drama lama about everything.", "I agree. Patching things up is step 1. Being a bridesmaid is step 2, not the other way around.", "This response is so on point ! I always wonder how Redditors are able to articulate these thoughts so perfectly. Everything I wanted to say to OP, you perfectly summarized.\nOP, listen to this person ! It\u2019s your day, if your sibling wants to patch up with you, they need to put the effort. It cannot be given to them on a platter !", "Yeah, one of my closest friends is a man and he stood for me as a Bridesman. It was an epic time.", "It really sounds like a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation.", "I would give you an award for this comment if I could afford it lol so here's the poor version --> \ud83c\udfc5", "Btw OP's sibling uses they/them pronouns", "This doesn't make sense.  You don't volunteer to be a bridesmaid.. You are asked.", "Hi, NB person here.  I'm not a him or a her, so I prefer not to be referred to as such.  \n\nI don't expect or ask people to understand my life experience and personal relationship with my own body, just to please respect my simple request to be referred to as they/them, which has existed as a gender neutral term in the English language for hundreds of years :)", "Though I understand your point of view, the vast majority of Reddit will disagree and you can expect your comment to be flagged down. \n\nYou have to respect pronouns on this sub.", "Not only women have to be in a bridal party tho", "Or, seeing how sibling has been as asshole to op all her life, op can ignore sibling and move on with her life.", "They're not talking to me at the moment. They sent me a text about how disappointed they are in me and blocked me. \n\nBut I'm not opposed to asking them, just this is wildly outside what I expected would go down.", "Why? Sibling has always treated op like crap. Why should op care about her??", "> well... you know what they say about assumptions.\n\nWhy did the sibling get to assume they would even be part of the wedding with their background and current relationship with OP? Couldn't they just ask if they can be part of the wedding instead of assuming it and exploding after OP didn't ask them? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you might consider trying to remedy the situation\n\nOP was blocked after a nasty text. (from a comment)   \nSo why does it fall on OP to fix the relationship? If they wanted to mend things they could have done it ages ago not on OPs wedding. \n\nHonestly all in all the sibling is acting entitled and childish. It is Ops wedding, one in a lifetime (for most) event and all they care about is that they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.", "Yeah, I'm feeling foolish now for not asking them. I honestly thought I was avoiding a fight, but started one instead. The wedding planning isn't far along, and I'd be happy to add them but they're pretty upset at me. I think I made this more of a headache than it needed to be.", "I wouldn't have been uncomfortable with them in the party. I just wanted to avoid drama but accidentally started drama instead. I thought I was saving myself a headache by not asking them at all...", ">they'd been a bit of TA\n\nattacking anyone for being feminine/masculine is never just **a bit** of an Asshole move. That goes into reactive bullying territory. \n\nAnd why is it on OP to do this? If they wanted to be part of the wedding they should have started to mend the relationship forever ago. They assumed they would just be part of it because \"family\" and now they throw a tantrum because OP has other people that fill that role. They even blocked contact and never talked about it with OP in the first place.", "It\u2019s not the responsibility of the injured party to fix things with the person who harmed them.", "She is in no way obligated to make someone her bridesmaid. It has very little to do with her sibling being nb and way more with the fact that they treated op like fucking shit", "Well, she has the history of more than two decades being abused by that sibling for having the unholy flaw of feminity. How was she to know that their being a NB means the past behavior doesn't matter anymore.", "I've been on aita to long, because I think that patching things up is just an excuse. I think sibling wanted to be asked to be able to claim disrespect, or to make it about them. \"I don't want to wear a dress\" \"I don't want a girly color\" \"I don't think spa is a good bachelorette party\" \"I don't want to do feminine stuff\".", "If they really wanted to be closer, they would\u2019ve made OP aware that despite a history of loathing all things feminine, they\u2019d love to share this experience & play a role in her special day. They wouldn\u2019t just stay mum & expect OP to be a mind reader.\n\n\nIt may also be a narcissist thing where sibling would\u2019ve been just as offended by being asked as they are not being asked. You can\u2019t win with some people.", "*And* they would have communicated in some way!", "This is random but I did read fast your comment and I thought you said \"and he stood for me as a Batman\" lol", "Thank you", "what doesn't make sense is, for someone who wants to patch things up, they waited to be asked and got angry when not.", "I thought 'they' mean't a group of people. But honestly sounds very wierd. Luckily I the closest I have come to listening this is on reddit. In my country people don't use this. Non binary means transgender and since transgender identify as female wouldn't it be fine to call them \"she\". I have nothing against these people it just sounds wierd. And honestly people shouldn't mind what pronouns they are called with.", "I respect the people I don't care about pronouns. I have never treated them badly and never will. They can flag down my comment I don't care. There are people telling that this is a \"mental disease\" which should be much more concerning than this. I may sound homophobic but I am not.", "If they weren't your sibling, would you even entertain the thought of them being a bridesmaid? \n\nYou said you put them on information diet and are not in the best of terms. Taking out the non binary thing, is this a person you'd want in your bridal party?", "Maybe that's your answer then. If they are not even willing to speak to you about it.", "Why would you ask them?  You've already indicated you're not close, that you walk around eggshells around them. You should pick people who you trust to be supportive and that you can rely on to be helping you with your wedding, not someone who just wants the title.", "I suspect that this isn\u2019t about being a bridesmaid but more about getting another chance to control, bully you and create unnecessary drama. Even if your sibling wasn\u2019t NB, you still are not required to ask them to be your bridesmaid.  You made the right choice. Enjoy your wedding.", "Guess it depends if shes bothered about a relationship with sibling", "NTA \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong \ud83d\udcaf", "OP, think of it this way:  the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior.  You looked at their past behavior and saw that their wearing a dress and participating in feminine things was considered in abhorrence by them.\n\nThis is all you have to say, really, to anyone.", "Tell them this. Tell them that you, in fact, had thought about it and you did not want to impede on their principles as you assumed they would if you did ask.\n\nSay you would love to have them in your bridal party, now that you know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n( But take no poop from them if they don\u2019t want to adhere to your vision of how your bridal party will look)", "I think you keep looking at this as how to save the peace and keep your sibling happy. My guess would be if you weren\u2019t family, you would have severed ties with them long ago due to their mistreatment and belittling of you. Do you really want them in your wedding party or are you again trying to save peace?", "i disagree, i suspect they would have been determined to start drama whether you asked them or not. at least this way the drama is actually contained and minimal and you get to have your fun wedding.\n\ni would, at wherever point you you have the opportunity, let them know that you thought that given everything else they've ever said about girly stuff and the bullying that happened growing up you assumed they'd be offended if asked. so you never did. frankly they have no one to blame but themselves for the way things have turned out. you want to have a nice time and have fun and you two don't have that together you have drama and baggage and mockery and bullying. \n\nif they want to patch things up and build a relationship your wedding party and planning is not the place to do it. that will make everything more emotionally complicated than needs to be and you need fun and help and support from people you trust emotionally to have your back not butt heads with you.\n\nsay all that in your own words. or show them this post. whatever you need to do, but mostly you just need to get across that your wedding is about you having a good time. and they're being unfair to you yet again. your wedding is not about them or their baggage.\n\nthey should attend as a guest, not as part of the party.", "sounds like you know there would have been drama either way. NTA   \n\n\nIt's not like they didn't give you a reason to not invite them", "She's said they get along now. If THAT'S true then assuming rather than asking is an AH move", "I have my own feelings about rigidly gendered rituals for everything and am planning to have my own wedding acknowledge the concept of gender as little as humanly possible... but I don't think OP needs the headache of trying to discuss this issue in those terms at all. (At least not right now, as opposed to, potentially, in an *actual* family therapy session, after the wedding.)\n\nFor now, don't engage in anything along the lines of, \"I didn't think you'd want to do any of the gender-coded activities that being in my wedding party entails.\" Address it as, \"We had a difficult relationship growing up and I'm still working through my feelings about that.\" OP could at this point suggest family therapy or otherwise express an interest in improving the relationship, but her sibling should be presented with the reality that their behavior growing up, whatever the sympathetic cause, was harmful, and this is a consequence. That much is not up for debate.", "This.  If OP had asked them they can cause drama because OP is expecting them to support patriarchal traditions.  Since OP didn't ask them they are causing drama claiming to feel insulted and left out.\n\nNothing OP did could make her sibling happy, sibling needs to fix themselves first.", "Now they are nonbinary it makes it all ok? Nah mate tell them fuck off", "Batman at your wedding would also be epic :-)", "Thank goodness I\u2019m not the only one! \ud83e\udd23", "Maybe he did both?  I personally would love to have Batman in my wedding party.", "Why should she?? Her sister sounds exhausting.", "Why did the sibling assume they would even get a spot as a bridesmaid?? Why didn't they just ask if they can be one? \n\nAnd now being pissed and blocking OP over it seems even more childish.", "I believe this is the correct response. I am a nonbinary person who was only able to accept femininity once I came out. I was never misogynistic like OP's sibling though, the issue is not offending the sibling but shielding OP from potentially toxic behavior and feelings from the past.", "This right here.  The OP is being respectful of her sibling's choices (pronouns, NB), and only addresses the pain caused with growing up with them."]}
