We\u2019ve visited each other  a couple of times over the last 2-3 years \n\nWhenever she comes to my apartment I plan ahead, asking in advance what she likes to eat, stocking my fridge more than usual, etc. Then when she arrives I make it clear to her that she has free access to the kitchen/bathroom and to just ask if she needs anything. Depending how long she\u2019s staying, I\u2019ll clear space for her in my closet. Basically, I\u2019m very mindful about making her feel welcome/at home, especially because she can be really shy and doesn\u2019t like to feel like she\u2019s \u201cbothering\u201d anyone. One time she forgot a towel and it took 2 days of her air-drying in the bathroom before I figured out she didn\u2019t bring one and offered it to her myself \n\nBut when I stay at her place, to put it bluntly, she makes me feel like I\u2019m bothering her as much as she fears she might be bothering me. Like if I stay at her place for 3 days, she\u2019ll offer me food maybe once. If I say I\u2019m hungry or ask for food, she tells me she doesn\u2019t really have much in the fridge. I usually end up ordering in, or she tells me I can go grocery shopping if I want. It\u2019s just really weird to me, to invite someone to your home and then tell them to go buy the food they\u2019ll be eating while they\u2019re there. I\u2019m not expecting a banquet but at least some acknowledgement that human beings need food would be nice\n\nOther than that, she just doesn\u2019t really \u201cact\u201d like I\u2019m there. She\u2019ll suddenly disappear mid-day for a 3 hour nap and not even tell me. Or call someone else on the phone for hours just to chat. She rarely plans anything for us to do together in her city. Usually if I don\u2019t want to spend my entire visit scrolling through my phone on her sofa, I\u2019m the one who has to organise the plans \n\nSo one of our mutual friends who lives in her city is getting married soon and I booked a hotel. My friend asked why I don\u2019t just stay with her and I decided to be honest and told her that she\u2019s not a great host and she makes me feel unwelcome. She seemed upset by this, even though I don\u2019t really know how this could come as a shock considering I\u2019ve mentioned how unwelcome I feel at her place more than once, but I think she brushed it off. In response, she told that she\u2019s dealing with money issues and work stress, which I get, but I told her that despite that it seems like she\u2019s not the type of person who\u2019s mindful about whether their guest is having a good time or not and I\u2019d rather just have my own space. She said I was insensitive and now things are strained between us. I could\u2019ve just not said anything but if my friend was unhappy with me, I would want to know \n\nAm I expecting too much here?

You don't have to change yours so we stay friends, I am not mad that I am not staying at your place. It is just more comfortable this way for me and I think it is also more comfortable for you.

The truth hurts, sometimes.", "NTA \n\nShe definitely needs to step it up and at least communicate when she's gonna be doing something else for hours so you can find something else to do or whatever. Sounds like she's just not thinking..", "NTA. I can't stand shitty hosts. It's time she heard the truth.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've mentioned feeling unwelcome before. Not your fault she chose not to believe you and that you took action to not continue to feel bad. \n\nAnd yeah, she doesn't need to roll out the red carpet but to invite someone to visit and then not to do the barest minimum to host sounds uncomfortable.", "NTA, I do the same thing as you. I ask their favorite foods then cook them. Show them where everything is located. I give extra blankets because I keep my house cool. Let them know they're welcome to adjust the temperature if they are hot or cold. Why have guests if you're gonna stay on your phone?", "NTA but you might be expecting too much of her.\n\nI find hosting to be incredibly stressful. Figuring out what food and stuff other people will like and putting it together is a nightmare. I tend to put it off and if at all possible would rather we decide together on food to order or what to do. When I have to plan for people, I do, but it sucks.\n\nYour friend has much more debilitating social anxiety than me - she'd rather stand in the bathroom and airdry than ask her friend of 10 years for a towel. Maybe consider other ways that might affect her.", "NTA. I used to have a good friend I would visit occasionally in my college town. The first time I stayed there she was kind of awkward and didn't seem like she wanted me there? I slept on the floor with 1 blanket and my own pillow because she told me she had everything covered and I didn't have to bring anything.\n\nThe next time i visited her was when I helped her move. I helped her pack her old apartment and clean it, then helped unpack the uhaul with her fiance (now husband). When I left, she told me not to worry about cleaning the guest bedroom because they had to keep unpacking anyway and everything that I used belonged somewhere else.\n\nThen she told everyone we knew that I made a huge mess in her guest room and left it disgusting. There was a deflated air mattress and 2 folded blankets in there when I left.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Some people are in your life for a reason, some for a season, and very rarely for your lifetime. It sounds like you're outgrowing the relationship.", "Do you have similar resources? It would be odd to host someone and not spontaneously offer them the amenities you'd provide any guest, certainly. But, if she can't afford to host you - she might not know how to tell you?\n\nNAH. I'd think she was rude at worst or clueless at best, if I had more information, But, frankly it really sounds to me like she has limited means and is embarrassed about that?", "NAH. Nothing on either side seems AH-worthy.\n\nWhile some of how the friend hosts is indeed bizarre (food, necessities, etc.)... other aspects I would actually enjoy (pretending I'm not even there some of the time). Sooo, to each their own.\n\nI don't think you'd be an AH for not wanting to stay with her though. It's not a big deal.", "NAH.\n\nShe definitely isn't the best at hosting, but I don't think she's doing it on purpose. You both are wired differently and how you host is how you host. I don't logically see either side being at fault here. As for a solution? Maybe talk to her about what you have posted here and what you can do to fix things. I can see that working well for you because it may be solved just because it was miscommunication? Give it your best shot.", "NTA you just told her it like it is. I have a friend like this and also feel uncomfortable when I stay there. However you can\u2019t expect them to buy you food and such- that\u2019s a nice gesture but as friends you should be able to handle your own needs", "NTA.  You did the right thing by making other arrangements. She should not have asked a question she didn\u2019t want the answer to.  You should probably reevaluate the friendship anyway. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much of a point to it.", "NTA but she isn't your friend.  Friends don't treat friends like this.", "I'm concerned that you understand less about hosting than you think.  You expect a guest to pack a towel?\n\nESH", "I think this comes down to life experiences, I'm guessing her family never had people stay with them much so she never saw what needs to be done. \n\nAs for food, I never expect people to buy extra for me if I am staying, and thats a chat we have before I even show up. (I buy stuff for everyone.) \n\nOne thing that surprised me in your post was, you say how great a host you are but do not put out towels for your guests?  I thought that was standard stuff.\n\n NAH- this is just different standards that after the first visit to her place should have be talked about before any other visits. Especially the food side of things and if you want to do things.\n\nAnd saying something about it now isnt making anyone an AH. Truth hurts sometimes.", "INFO: who makes more money your friend or you? How long have y\u2019all known one another?", "Uhm... don't know if I'd exactly render an AH judgment on anyone here, but yes, you kind of are expecting too much. I feel like she expects \"hosting\" to be \"provide lodging\", and you expect it to be the full package with food and entertainment. So she thinks of you as a short-term roommate when she hosts, or like a free AirBnB. Nobody expects their roommates or AirBnB hosts to provide food and leisure.

So it can be very different between people and how they were brought up (my grandma would be OFFENDED if I let a guest wash their dishes; my brain from my student years is however interfering - it is common courtesy that you clean after yourself if you are staying somewhere for several days and not expect the host to do everything)", "I'd find it odd, not rude.", "So it\u2019s expected to be together 3 straight days?", "So you pack a damp towel in your luggage going home?

As for taking a nap while you\u2019re there, I think it\u2019s also reasonable for each of you to get some down time without needing to spend every minute together (and it may be that the nap ended up being longer than she expected).

You said she's shy and is worried about bothering someone, which sounds like social anxiety and rejection sensitivity to me. Not planning anything sounds like she is worried that she'll plan the wrong thing, and you'll get mad. In situations like that, it's easier to not plan anything in case it's the wrong thing. Taking a nap for 3 hours? Her social battery is full and she needed to recharge on her own. \n\nIt sounds to me like you two just have different interests and are starting to grow apart.

Is she broadly detached from reality in general?\n\nPerhaps the better way of framing your decision not to stay with her would have been to say: I really don\u2019t want to inconvenience you, and I like having my own separate space where I can come and go without bothering anyone. \n\nFraming it around her poor hostess skills came off hurtful. It\u2019s OK if she\u2019s a bad host\u2014you can just choose to stay elsewhere as you\u2019re doing for the wedding.

I also host people at my place whenever anyone I'm close with asks. \n\nMy belief is it's the visitor's job to make plans. The host lives there and goes about their lives as normal, the visitor is the one who's on vacation and will probably have a schedule of activities. The host should make themselves available when they can to hang out with the visitor, and help out with planning activities only if asked for their expertise on the area. \n\nIn regards to food, some people don't keep stocked fridges, and mostly eat out. I don't usually have a lot of in my fridge, but even when I travel, friends just offer me drinks and snacks. The host should certainly give you recommendations on take out, local grocery stores, and offer to combine when ordering delivery, but planning and cooking meals is going above and beyond.\n\nThis is a NAH situation because you prefer staying in a hotel, and she asked for your reasoning why.

The anxiety and over-thinking can become so overwhelming that I'll functionally just freeze up and do 'nothing' (what else do you do if every active choice seems like the wrong one?), and used to try to act like that was normal and fine because I didn't recognize what was happening internally and had no tools to deal with it even if I had understood. \n\nAs for why she inquired, I don't know many people who are uniformly anxious about everything in any context.

People need down time occasionally- if there isn't a set plan for that time, I don't see why OP should expect to be fully entertained for every moment of the week. And I don't think OP actually does expect that. The problem is that OP's friend hasn't made them comfortable enough to be at ease in her home. When I'm with my friends, they make it clear their home is my home and I have full run of the place. If they fuck off for a nap unexpectedly, I don't feel weird helping myself to snacks, watching tv, or coming and going.

We behave like short-term roommates because we're both pretty independent, busy women.\n\nEither way, if OP was uncomfortable, clearly this doesn't apply here.

What if OP wants to make something, or use something like a kitchen tool or entertainment console? What if OP needs to shower, needs bathroom supplies? Should OP just snoop through the house or use things without permission?

The towel has the whole night to dry and then gets packed with everything else. Literally no extra trouble taken to accomplish this.\n\nBringing plastic bags/hamper bags for your dirty clothes is also super normal when traveling, otherwise the clothes that are still clean end up soiled as well when they get mixed together and then everything has to be washed.", "YTA.

There weren't any activities planned, and while they are really nice, they're not very talkative. \n\nMeanwhile when my husband (then boyfriend) visited my family and I, the bed was done before we arrived, my Mom had prepared towels and toiletries, she offered him a tour of the house and the garden so that he would know where everything was, she took time to ask questions about him and his family, and she took care in preparing nice homemade meals and pastries especially for him\n\nNow things are better, and I've gotten used to their way of doing things, but it is certain that growing up in a family used to host other people makes one more aware of what it usually entails", "Such a good point.

I also let friends and family crash with me frequently when they're coming to my city, and it's important to me to make sure they know that doesn't come with strings attached, and I'm just happy to see them when I see them.

I do think your way and expectations are a lot more traditional, and you certainly don't have to stay with your friend if you are uncomfortable.

Sounds like your friend lives in the land of oblivion.", "Nta if she has personal issues she should explain that and say she can\u2019t have guest for the time being the fact you hinted at the and it still got you nowhere and she didn\u2019t really take your comments on board shows that she isn\u2019t interested in being a good host. I agree don\u2019t see how it can come as a surprise", "NTA. I think you approached this conversation respectfully. She is the one who asked you why you were staying in a hotel. I can\u2019t imagine being that rude to a guest in my house", "Reminds me of when I got a $50 gift card. I ordered an app, my meal and my friend ordered hers .. twice the price of mine. She got a call and walked outside. App came. Entrees came. I waved her down, and she waved me off. I ate; paid the bill and left. She was pissed I left her there. \n\nI cut her off and you should do the same.", ",, I had a friend like this when I was younger. that friend and I are no longer in contact for reasons unrelated to these behaviors but I did feel increasingly like I was imposing and unwelcome and burdensome or irritating when I'd visit. when I take time to visit people,, it feels like either they should commit more to the visit Or say outright it'll be a lowkey fend-for-yourself sort of visit yknow?\n\nNTA, in any case. knowing your friend and your situation means you made the best decision, if your friend's upset that's smth to work out seperately from the visit", "I don't know. I'm kind of in two minds about this one. Something just jumped out at me. the waiting two days for the towel thing - as an aside, maybe have guest towels in the future? I wouldn't expect guests to bring their own towels myself, but I digress.\n\nSo. I'd be a host like you OP, if people came to stay with me, I love hosting.\n\nBut at the same time, if I stayed over at someone's, I wouldn't expect food and stuff.  \nLike, if I went and stayed at my friend's, I'd like to do some stuff together but I would kind of expect we'd have separate times to do whatever as well, and I'd buy my own groceries. But I understand that's probably my own fear of inconveniencing (yay, childhood trauma).\n\nIt's just, the fact that this friend didn't ask after a towel shows she's not one to impose her own needs, so I feel like calling her out is a bit mean. It's just different expectations. You can totally stay at a hotel, that's fine, but telling the person they're a shitty host.. I don't know.. Seems kind of pointless to me. You could have just said you'd feel more comfortable there.\n\nI'm gonna say NAH because I just don't think she's necessarily one either. It's just different expectations. But I get the need to be the kind of host you are, OP.", "I think YTA for having unreasonable expectations of a host. She is providing you a free place to sleep and you want free food too? That's not a reasonable expectation for a guest. Everytike I have ever stayed with friends I would go pick up my own food or go out to eat!", "When I stay with close friends we usually outline the basics before anyone arrives. I almost always start with a trip to the grocery store. I typically buy most of the food in exchange for them hosting me. Side bonus buying your own food means you\u2019ll have exactly what you want to eat. I try to find out before I visit if we are doing activities together, hanging out around the house together or if I should be planning to do my own thing. Essentially the more you communicate BEFORE you arrive the less blindsided or hurt various people feel during a visit!", ">One time she forgot a towel and it took 2 days of her air-drying in the bathroom before I figured out she didn\u2019t bring one and offered it to her myself\n\nThat jumped out at me as well. Providing towels is Hosting 101.", "Oh my god thank you. I\u2019ve been combing through these responses trying to find someone who mentioned the towel thing. That\u2019s just super weird.", "Also, I'm not sure where OP lives,  but where I'm from, it's pretty common to provide towels and toiletries/wash cloths for your guests. So OP may not be as perfect of a host either.", "This is so true.\nWhen I visit places I'm very tidy, keep myself small, don't want to interfere with the hosts life, but also set the tone to who I'm surrounded by.\n\nIf they are low key, I'm low key. If they want to do fun shit, I'm doing fun shit. \n\nBut, I also don't expect them to get food for me. I buy my own food if I want something or chip in if food is being purchased. But I would never expect them to go out of their way for anything. \n\nIf you're visiting my place, you better make yourself at home. I'm going to ask you all the time what you need and if you want me to cook you something. But I'm not making plans to do shit unless something is explicitly stated.  It's your vacation, why would I plan that for you?", "Yeah, it's crazy to me that she extra stocks her fridge, but doesn't leave towels sitting on the bed, or a chair or whatever, for her guests!\n\n\"These towels are yours\" is like, the third thing I say after \"Hello\" and \"let me show you where you're sleeping!\""]}
