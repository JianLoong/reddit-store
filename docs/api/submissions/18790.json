We\u2019ve visited each other  a couple of times over the last 2-3 years \n\nWhenever she comes to my apartment I plan ahead, asking in advance what she likes to eat, stocking my fridge more than usual, etc. Then when she arrives I make it clear to her that she has free access to the kitchen/bathroom and to just ask if she needs anything. Depending how long she\u2019s staying, I\u2019ll clear space for her in my closet. Basically, I\u2019m very mindful about making her feel welcome/at home, especially because she can be really shy and doesn\u2019t like to feel like she\u2019s \u201cbothering\u201d anyone. One time she forgot a towel and it took 2 days of her air-drying in the bathroom before I figured out she didn\u2019t bring one and offered it to her myself \n\nBut when I stay at her place, to put it bluntly, she makes me feel like I\u2019m bothering her as much as she fears she might be bothering me. Like if I stay at her place for 3 days, she\u2019ll offer me food maybe once. If I say I\u2019m hungry or ask for food, she tells me she doesn\u2019t really have much in the fridge. I usually end up ordering in, or she tells me I can go grocery shopping if I want. It\u2019s just really weird to me, to invite someone to your home and then tell them to go buy the food they\u2019ll be eating while they\u2019re there. I\u2019m not expecting a banquet but at least some acknowledgement that human beings need food would be nice\n\nOther than that, she just doesn\u2019t really \u201cact\u201d like I\u2019m there. She\u2019ll suddenly disappear mid-day for a 3 hour nap and not even tell me. Or call someone else on the phone for hours just to chat. She rarely plans anything for us to do together in her city. Usually if I don\u2019t want to spend my entire visit scrolling through my phone on her sofa, I\u2019m the one who has to organise the plans \n\nSo one of our mutual friends who lives in her city is getting married soon and I booked a hotel. My friend asked why I don\u2019t just stay with her and I decided to be honest and told her that she\u2019s not a great host and she makes me feel unwelcome. She seemed upset by this, even though I don\u2019t really know how this could come as a shock considering I\u2019ve mentioned how unwelcome I feel at her place more than once, but I think she brushed it off. In response, she told that she\u2019s dealing with money issues and work stress, which I get, but I told her that despite that it seems like she\u2019s not the type of person who\u2019s mindful about whether their guest is having a good time or not and I\u2019d rather just have my own space. She said I was insensitive and now things are strained between us. I could\u2019ve just not said anything but if my friend was unhappy with me, I would want to know \n\nAm I expecting too much here?

You were honest and instead of expecting her to change you made your own arrangements. If there is a strain on the relationship, it will be coming from how your friend is interpreting your feedback. Maybe contact her and say something like \"Listen, I don't want you to feel bad about it. People are different, with different characters and behaviors. You don't have to change yours so we stay friends, I am not mad that I am not staying at your place. It is just more comfortable this way for me and I think it is also more comfortable for you. When you feel less strained if you want we can try again?\"", "NTA she has accepted your hospitality but when it is her turn she doesn\u00b4t keep up her end of the bargain. \n\nYou did not make a big deal out of it, just \"note to self: not doing this again\" and booked a hotel. She asked why, you told her the truth with no drama. I don\u00b4t see anything wrong with that.", "NTA.  I'm not going to stay with anyone to be treated like that. The truth hurts, sometimes.", "NTA \n\nShe definitely needs to step it up and at least communicate when she's gonna be doing something else for hours so you can find something else to do or whatever. Sounds like she's just not thinking..", "NTA. I can't stand shitty hosts. It's time she heard the truth.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've mentioned feeling unwelcome before. Not your fault she chose not to believe you and that you took action to not continue to feel bad. \n\nAnd yeah, she doesn't need to roll out the red carpet but to invite someone to visit and then not to do the barest minimum to host sounds uncomfortable.", "NTA, I do the same thing as you. I ask their favorite foods then cook them. Show them where everything is located. I give extra blankets because I keep my house cool. Let them know they're welcome to adjust the temperature if they are hot or cold. Why have guests if you're gonna stay on your phone?", "NTA but you might be expecting too much of her.\n\nI find hosting to be incredibly stressful. Figuring out what food and stuff other people will like and putting it together is a nightmare. I tend to put it off and if at all possible would rather we decide together on food to order or what to do. When I have to plan for people, I do, but it sucks.\n\nYour friend has much more debilitating social anxiety than me - she'd rather stand in the bathroom and airdry than ask her friend of 10 years for a towel. Maybe consider other ways that might affect her.", "NTA. I used to have a good friend I would visit occasionally in my college town. The first time I stayed there she was kind of awkward and didn't seem like she wanted me there? I slept on the floor with 1 blanket and my own pillow because she told me she had everything covered and I didn't have to bring anything.\n\nThe next time i visited her was when I helped her move. I helped her pack her old apartment and clean it, then helped unpack the uhaul with her fiance (now husband). When I left, she told me not to worry about cleaning the guest bedroom because they had to keep unpacking anyway and everything that I used belonged somewhere else.\n\nThen she told everyone we knew that I made a huge mess in her guest room and left it disgusting. There was a deflated air mattress and 2 folded blankets in there when I left.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Some people are in your life for a reason, some for a season, and very rarely for your lifetime. It sounds like you're outgrowing the relationship.", "Do you have similar resources? It would be odd to host someone and not spontaneously offer them the amenities you'd provide any guest, certainly. But, if she can't afford to host you - she might not know how to tell you?\n\nNAH. I'd think she was rude at worst or clueless at best, if I had more information, But, frankly it really sounds to me like she has limited means and is embarrassed about that?", "NAH. Nothing on either side seems AH-worthy.\n\nWhile some of how the friend hosts is indeed bizarre (food, necessities, etc.)... other aspects I would actually enjoy (pretending I'm not even there some of the time). Sooo, to each their own.\n\nI don't think you'd be an AH for not wanting to stay with her though. It's not a big deal.", "NAH.\n\nShe definitely isn't the best at hosting, but I don't think she's doing it on purpose. You both are wired differently and how you host is how you host. I don't logically see either side being at fault here. As for a solution? Maybe talk to her about what you have posted here and what you can do to fix things. I can see that working well for you because it may be solved just because it was miscommunication? Give it your best shot.", "NTA you just told her it like it is. I have a friend like this and also feel uncomfortable when I stay there. However you can\u2019t expect them to buy you food and such- that\u2019s a nice gesture but as friends you should be able to handle your own needs", "NTA.  You did the right thing by making other arrangements. She should not have asked a question she didn\u2019t want the answer to.  You should probably reevaluate the friendship anyway. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much of a point to it.", "NTA but she isn't your friend.  Friends don't treat friends like this.", "I'm concerned that you understand less about hosting than you think.  You expect a guest to pack a towel?\n\nESH", "I think this comes down to life experiences, I'm guessing her family never had people stay with them much so she never saw what needs to be done. \n\nAs for food, I never expect people to buy extra for me if I am staying, and thats a chat we have before I even show up. (I buy stuff for everyone.) \n\nOne thing that surprised me in your post was, you say how great a host you are but do not put out towels for your guests?  I thought that was standard stuff.\n\n NAH- this is just different standards that after the first visit to her place should have be talked about before any other visits. Especially the food side of things and if you want to do things.\n\nAnd saying something about it now isnt making anyone an AH. Truth hurts sometimes.", "INFO: who makes more money your friend or you? How long have y\u2019all known one another?", "Uhm... don't know if I'd exactly render an AH judgment on anyone here, but yes, you kind of are expecting too much. I feel like she expects \"hosting\" to be \"provide lodging\", and you expect it to be the full package with food and entertainment. So she thinks of you as a short-term roommate when she hosts, or like a free AirBnB. Nobody expects their roommates or AirBnB hosts to provide food and leisure. Is it a difference in the cultural expectations, perhaps?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My family has always bought groceries for the host when we stay someplace, and we often make plans together. But your expectations are not extreme. Especially if you want to spend time with her and she basically ignores you.\n\nIt seems like staying with her is just about the same as getting a hotel. And with how many times you have brought up feeling unwelcome, she shouldn't be surprised by this \"revelation.\"", "Yeah I will try talking to her about it again more gently.

When she comes to my house I assume she wants to have a good time while she\u2019s here so I try to make that happen\n\nMaybe I should\u2019ve included this in the post but we both come from a culture that really values making your guests comfortable, like cooking them full meals 3x a day levels of comfortable, not that I expect/offer anything close to that. So that shared background is part of the reason that her behaviour makes me uncomfortable", "They're friends, I don't think she expected entertaining, I think she was expecting her to be ENGAGED. Hang out, not go disappear for hours on phone call without saying anything.", "Honestly, I've had friends say \"Feel like this is your home\" to other friends visiting them and then the guests proceed to walk around in their underwear feeling REALLY at home. I've had guests that expected me to be super active and spend a lot of time together and other times I have had friends stay over at my place when it was super busy for me (I had warned them) and they planned their own things and were out and about and just crashing at my place at the end of the day (we did have breakfasts usually together and then a nice dinner at the end of it all). So it can be very different between people and how they were brought up (my grandma would be OFFENDED if I let a guest wash their dishes; my brain from my student years is however interfering - it is common courtesy that you clean after yourself if you are staying somewhere for several days and not expect the host to do everything)", "I'd find it odd, not rude.", "So it\u2019s expected to be together 3 straight days?", "So you pack a damp towel in your luggage going home?  That's absurd.", "Sounds like she\u2019s hard up with bills.

What would she \"need\" from her while she's taking a nap? It's not her first time visiting.\n\nI don't think anyone is TA here. OP is a thoughtful hostess and from the sounds of it, enjoys hosting. The friend just doesn't put that much effort in. That doesn't make them an AH for not being an amazing host", "So you can\u2019t shower the day you leave?", "Why do you go to that trouble?", "I shower at night. I cant go to sleep without showering. I usually fly back home early morning so no problem :) works perfectly for me!", "Why would it be a problem? Its good for me and also less work for my host. As a guest you also have to try to make your presence pleasant and not adding more stress or work to them ;)"]}
