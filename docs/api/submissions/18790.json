We\u2019ve visited each other  a couple of times over the last 2-3 years \n\nWhenever she comes to my apartment I plan ahead, asking in advance what she likes to eat, stocking my fridge more than usual, etc. Then when she arrives I make it clear to her that she has free access to the kitchen/bathroom and to just ask if she needs anything. Depending how long she\u2019s staying, I\u2019ll clear space for her in my closet. Basically, I\u2019m very mindful about making her feel welcome/at home, especially because she can be really shy and doesn\u2019t like to feel like she\u2019s \u201cbothering\u201d anyone. One time she forgot a towel and it took 2 days of her air-drying in the bathroom before I figured out she didn\u2019t bring one and offered it to her myself \n\nBut when I stay at her place, to put it bluntly, she makes me feel like I\u2019m bothering her as much as she fears she might be bothering me. Like if I stay at her place for 3 days, she\u2019ll offer me food maybe once. If I say I\u2019m hungry or ask for food, she tells me she doesn\u2019t really have much in the fridge. I usually end up ordering in, or she tells me I can go grocery shopping if I want. It\u2019s just really weird to me, to invite someone to your home and then tell them to go buy the food they\u2019ll be eating while they\u2019re there. I\u2019m not expecting a banquet but at least some acknowledgement that human beings need food would be nice\n\nOther than that, she just doesn\u2019t really \u201cact\u201d like I\u2019m there. She\u2019ll suddenly disappear mid-day for a 3 hour nap and not even tell me. Or call someone else on the phone for hours just to chat. She rarely plans anything for us to do together in her city. Usually if I don\u2019t want to spend my entire visit scrolling through my phone on her sofa, I\u2019m the one who has to organise the plans \n\nSo one of our mutual friends who lives in her city is getting married soon and I booked a hotel. My friend asked why I don\u2019t just stay with her and I decided to be honest and told her that she\u2019s not a great host and she makes me feel unwelcome. She seemed upset by this, even though I don\u2019t really know how this could come as a shock considering I\u2019ve mentioned how unwelcome I feel at her place more than once, but I think she brushed it off. In response, she told that she\u2019s dealing with money issues and work stress, which I get, but I told her that despite that it seems like she\u2019s not the type of person who\u2019s mindful about whether their guest is having a good time or not and I\u2019d rather just have my own space. She said I was insensitive and now things are strained between us. I could\u2019ve just not said anything but if my friend was unhappy with me, I would want to know \n\nAm I expecting too much here?

You don't have to change yours so we stay friends, I am not mad that I am not staying at your place. It is just more comfortable this way for me and I think it is also more comfortable for you.

The truth hurts, sometimes.", "NTA \n\nShe definitely needs to step it up and at least communicate when she's gonna be doing something else for hours so you can find something else to do or whatever. Sounds like she's just not thinking..", "NTA. I can't stand shitty hosts. It's time she heard the truth.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've mentioned feeling unwelcome before. Not your fault she chose not to believe you and that you took action to not continue to feel bad. \n\nAnd yeah, she doesn't need to roll out the red carpet but to invite someone to visit and then not to do the barest minimum to host sounds uncomfortable.", "NTA, I do the same thing as you. I ask their favorite foods then cook them. Show them where everything is located. I give extra blankets because I keep my house cool. Let them know they're welcome to adjust the temperature if they are hot or cold. Why have guests if you're gonna stay on your phone?", "NTA but you might be expecting too much of her.\n\nI find hosting to be incredibly stressful. Figuring out what food and stuff other people will like and putting it together is a nightmare. I tend to put it off and if at all possible would rather we decide together on food to order or what to do. When I have to plan for people, I do, but it sucks.\n\nYour friend has much more debilitating social anxiety than me - she'd rather stand in the bathroom and airdry than ask her friend of 10 years for a towel. Maybe consider other ways that might affect her.", "NTA. I used to have a good friend I would visit occasionally in my college town. The first time I stayed there she was kind of awkward and didn't seem like she wanted me there? I slept on the floor with 1 blanket and my own pillow because she told me she had everything covered and I didn't have to bring anything.\n\nThe next time i visited her was when I helped her move. I helped her pack her old apartment and clean it, then helped unpack the uhaul with her fiance (now husband). When I left, she told me not to worry about cleaning the guest bedroom because they had to keep unpacking anyway and everything that I used belonged somewhere else.\n\nThen she told everyone we knew that I made a huge mess in her guest room and left it disgusting. There was a deflated air mattress and 2 folded blankets in there when I left.\n\nWe haven't talked since. Some people are in your life for a reason, some for a season, and very rarely for your lifetime. It sounds like you're outgrowing the relationship.", "Do you have similar resources? It would be odd to host someone and not spontaneously offer them the amenities you'd provide any guest, certainly. But, if she can't afford to host you - she might not know how to tell you?\n\nNAH. I'd think she was rude at worst or clueless at best, if I had more information, But, frankly it really sounds to me like she has limited means and is embarrassed about that?", "NAH. Nothing on either side seems AH-worthy.\n\nWhile some of how the friend hosts is indeed bizarre (food, necessities, etc.)... other aspects I would actually enjoy (pretending I'm not even there some of the time). Sooo, to each their own.\n\nI don't think you'd be an AH for not wanting to stay with her though. It's not a big deal.", "NAH.\n\nShe definitely isn't the best at hosting, but I don't think she's doing it on purpose. You both are wired differently and how you host is how you host. I don't logically see either side being at fault here. As for a solution? Maybe talk to her about what you have posted here and what you can do to fix things. I can see that working well for you because it may be solved just because it was miscommunication? Give it your best shot.", "NTA you just told her it like it is. I have a friend like this and also feel uncomfortable when I stay there. However you can\u2019t expect them to buy you food and such- that\u2019s a nice gesture but as friends you should be able to handle your own needs", "NTA.  You did the right thing by making other arrangements. She should not have asked a question she didn\u2019t want the answer to.  You should probably reevaluate the friendship anyway. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much of a point to it.", "NTA but she isn't your friend.  Friends don't treat friends like this.", "I'm concerned that you understand less about hosting than you think.  You expect a guest to pack a towel?\n\nESH", "I think this comes down to life experiences, I'm guessing her family never had people stay with them much so she never saw what needs to be done. \n\nAs for food, I never expect people to buy extra for me if I am staying, and thats a chat we have before I even show up. (I buy stuff for everyone.) \n\nOne thing that surprised me in your post was, you say how great a host you are but do not put out towels for your guests?  I thought that was standard stuff.\n\n NAH- this is just different standards that after the first visit to her place should have be talked about before any other visits. Especially the food side of things and if you want to do things.\n\nAnd saying something about it now isnt making anyone an AH. Truth hurts sometimes.", "INFO: who makes more money your friend or you? How long have y\u2019all known one another?", "Uhm... don't know if I'd exactly render an AH judgment on anyone here, but yes, you kind of are expecting too much. I feel like she expects \"hosting\" to be \"provide lodging\", and you expect it to be the full package with food and entertainment. So she thinks of you as a short-term roommate when she hosts, or like a free AirBnB. Nobody expects their roommates or AirBnB hosts to provide food and leisure.

So it can be very different between people and how they were brought up (my grandma would be OFFENDED if I let a guest wash their dishes; my brain from my student years is however interfering - it is common courtesy that you clean after yourself if you are staying somewhere for several days and not expect the host to do everything)", "I'd find it odd, not rude.", "So it\u2019s expected to be together 3 straight days?", "So you pack a damp towel in your luggage going home?

As for taking a nap while you\u2019re there, I think it\u2019s also reasonable for each of you to get some down time without needing to spend every minute together (and it may be that the nap ended up being longer than she expected).

You said she's shy and is worried about bothering someone, which sounds like social anxiety and rejection sensitivity to me. Not planning anything sounds like she is worried that she'll plan the wrong thing, and you'll get mad. In situations like that, it's easier to not plan anything in case it's the wrong thing. Taking a nap for 3 hours? Her social battery is full and she needed to recharge on her own. \n\nIt sounds to me like you two just have different interests and are starting to grow apart.

Is she broadly detached from reality in general?\n\nPerhaps the better way of framing your decision not to stay with her would have been to say: I really don\u2019t want to inconvenience you, and I like having my own separate space where I can come and go without bothering anyone. \n\nFraming it around her poor hostess skills came off hurtful. It\u2019s OK if she\u2019s a bad host\u2014you can just choose to stay elsewhere as you\u2019re doing for the wedding.

If my friend bought me food I would WANT to fill the fridge for them when they come over. Very strange.", "NAH. Whenever I travel I try to stay with friends, because I think a hotel is a waste of money, particularly because I'll probably be hanging with the people I'm staying with quite a bit. I also host people at my place whenever anyone I'm close with asks. \n\nMy belief is it's the visitor's job to make plans. The host lives there and goes about their lives as normal, the visitor is the one who's on vacation and will probably have a schedule of activities. The host's job is to make themselves available when they can to hang out with the visitor, and help out with planning activities only if asked for their expertise on the area. \n\nIn regards to food, some people don't keep stocked fridges, and mostly eat out. I don't usually have a lot of in my fridge, but even when I travel friends just offer me drinks and snacks. The host should certainly give you recommendations on take out, local grocery stores, and offer to combine when ordering delivery, but planning and cooking meals is going above and beyond.\n\nThis is a NAH situation because you prefer staying in a hotel, and she asked for your reasoning why. If you'd demanded she host you and comply with your expectations then that would make it YTA.", "I think you could have framed it differently/more nicely, like \"It seems like it stresses you out when I'm there more than it's fun for you. I'm more comfortable in a hotel because I felt less like I'm intruding on your space,\" and if she asks you can give her examples. But she def needed to know why, so I don't think you're TA for telling her overall.", "Soft YTA. I feel the delivery could be improved. Maybe they don\u2019t know how to host people or need some help- like you explained the problem but didn\u2019t offer suggestions? Maybe you did do this but didn\u2019t explain it in your post.\n\nEspecially wrt money problems (and seems like possibly depression/anxiety/ADHD) they could be cut some slack\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s always a good idea to let an incapable person save face if you can help it. So like instead of saying it sucks to stay there, say you really like staying at hotel. One thing to have a capable person who maliciously doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s expected, very different to have an incapable person unable to do what\u2019s expected.", "Nta. But it sounds like your friend is not in  the same financial position as you,  and sounds like she might be coping with depression. I believe being completely honest with our friends is super important. It more about how you say it, than what you are saying. If she is a person you really care about and like to visit ( and it seems like she does like to host you), consider that your visit might be putting some strain on her existence, but she still has you over anyway, because friend love!  Maybe if your willing to spring for a hotel to visit this city, maybe you can offer to do some groceries with her or whatever instead.", "NAH. You have different mindsets about hosting and what it entails.\n\nLook at it from her perspective: you are an adult capable of entertaining, feeding and caring for yourself, and you've been together at least 3 years, so you know where stuff in her house is. For her, you're past the guest stage, so expecting her to play concierge and wait on you is a little weird.\n\nFor you, she's still a guest in your home, because you're not together all that much or all that often, and when you have a guest, you cater to that guest's needs - even if it makes her feel uncomfortable and worry about being a bother.\n\nYou're not running an Airbnb here. Stop expecting her to run one for you. Chill and let go of the 'tourist' experience and enjoy the visit.", "NTA I think you have moved on, and that was the right decision.", "NTA", "NTA - but she might see your friendship differently to how you do. How casual I am about hosting depends on the friend tbh - although I do at least make sure there's food in the fridge.", "NTA. If she\u2019s going to act like you\u2019re just there to sleep, and not actually make plans to spend time with you, then you might as well get a real hotel.", "NTA. ITs pretty obvious that she is not a real friend, doesnt really care about you and is using you. Cut her loose and dont look back.", "NTA i think you communicated it well", "I mean, some people just suck at hosting. You are NTA for getting a hotel, and she shouldn\u2019t get bent out of shape that you did.", "NTA you have the right expectations. It seems like she has not learned these things. You are teaching her by being open about your thoughts and feelings. It is time for her to learn.", "NAH.    When i was 24 and staying at a friends house for the weekend, we would show up with beer and wing the rest. We didnt have money so the fridges were often empty. And we were comfortable  in each others houses that helped ourselves.  Everyone's different. Have a chat with your friend.", "Mostly NTA but who the hell brings their own towels?", "NTA", "Your friend is probably unusual neurologically. \n\nNta", " NTA I get not always having a lot of time or money to play the perfect hostess, but\n\n1. she should make that clear to you before you visit, so you know what to expect and how to budget your money and your time\n\n2. things like making time for you while you\u2019re there, not calling other people, making plans to go sight seeing or something when she\u2019s off work etc don\u2019t have to cost money and would go a long way yo making you feel welcome; it seems like she wants to have her cake and eat it too, aka basically ignore you while you\u2019re there but also feel good about hosting", "She is not your friend.  Adhere to the definition of friend", "NTA.\n\nIt costs nothing just to spend time with the person who's visiting you, if she's struggling financially she could look at free / low cost things to do, maybe go to a park or local free/cheap attraction.\n\nRegarding food, if she was struggling that much she can't afford to pay for 2 peoples food, just be honest and let the visitor know, maybe suggest you go shopping together and split the bill. If I was visiting and the host told me they were struggling, I'd probably just get the bill as thanks for them providing accomodation and to help out a friend. I'd certainly prefer that to them just telling me to go get groceries or not even mention food to me.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll offer what her (albeit deluded) perspective might be: perhaps she doesn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d put out your financial obligation by getting a hotel room when you could \u201cstay for free\u201d with her. In other words, maybe she truly doesn\u2019t get that you can afford it while she can\u2019t. If you\u2019ve mentioned in the past, especially multiple times, that you feel unwelcome that\u2019s definitely on her. And this might seem a bit petty (as it seems you\u2019ve made yourself into a wonderful host now) but I always assume my guests don\u2019t have their own towel and provide one. Very weird on her part to also not ask for a towel though LOL", "I do not think her style of hosting is so terrible. I guess I can be a poor host too. I mean, I do offer and plan, sometimes it comes off as overbearing I think. Basically I do not think the way she is when you are at her home is terrible.\n\nNow, her saying you are insensitive... I do not like it. She asked, you answered. She cannot expect every answer to be gentle as spring rain.\n\nTough judgement. Mild NTA. Because of the insensitive thing. As you just removed yourself from the situation.", "Do you have similar resources? It would be odd to host someone and not spontaneously offer them the amenities you'd provide any guest, certainly.", "Agree.  How can a friend \u201cforget\u201d to bring a towel? Towels provided by the host, of course.", "Especially after being catered to by op on several previous stays. The \"friend\" at this point is choosing to be ignorant if they act shocked at this news.", "> you both are wired differently\n\nYeah the OP is normal and the friend is self-centred and inconsiderate. Quite how you can think treating a guest like that is acceptable is beyond me.", "I dunno OP is calling her a bad host, and she can't even provide towels.", "OP was there to visit this friend not looking for a free Airbnb", "TBH, if feel like you have mismatched ideas of hosting. \n\nShe probably sees your visit to her as \u201cstay in my place and do your own thing, I\u2019m just your free hotel room\u201d\n\nYou seem to see it as \u201cI am your very organized host and I will plan everything for you\u201d \n\nNeither is *wrong* necessarily. But it\u2019s ok to chill out when you host (or just stop hosting her at all) if you no longer want to offer her that since she doesn\u2019t reciprocate. \n\n(And, she may be on a tighter budget than you with the food/activities thing). \n\nIt\u2019s one of those things where different people do it differently. \n\nI\u2019m old enough that when people visit I just bluntly ask \u201cdo you want my place as. A free hotel and I\u2019ll leave you alone, or do you want me to play tour guide?\u201d And go from there.  And I *very carefully* try not to expect anything when I stay with others.", "I believe being completely honest with our friends is super important.", ">But anxiety isn't what comes to mind when I read the OP's story.  To me, the OP's friend sounds like she's socially inept.\n\nThose aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nI thankfully have the awareness, now, to know I am not equipped to be a good host, but I can 100% see my own stress responses having the result OP described.  The anxiety and over-thinking can become so overwhelming that I'll functionally just freeze up and do 'nothing' (what else do you do if every active choice seems like the wrong one?), and used to try to act like that was normal and fine because I didn't recognize what was happening internally and had no tools to deal with it even if I had understood. \n\nAs for why she inquired, I don't know many people who are uniformly anxious about everything in any context. Also maybe that had happened enough times without OP commenting about it that she had convinced herself it was indeed fine?", "Idk. If you're staying with someone you're close with for 5+ days I don't think it's rude to take a nap without communicating. People need down time occasionally- if there isn't a set plan for that time, I don't see why OP should expect to be fully entertained for every moment of the week. And I don't think OP actually does expect that. The problem is that OP's friend hasn't made them comfortable enough to be at ease in her home. When I'm with my friends, they make it clear their home is my home and I have full run of the place. If they fuck off for a nap unexpectedly, I don't feel weird helping myself to snacks, watching tv, or coming and going. But in this situation it sounds like OP feels really unwelcome and is probably just stuck there for hours with nothing to do.", "tbh for me the source of my anxiety, half the time, is The Unknown. i would much rather know wtf is going on (ie have the difficult conversation) than be kept in the dark (ie blindsided by sudden confrontation/argument). especially if it's Not Knowing but Feeling like something is Wrong. that's the anxiety. \n\nI'd say not asking for a towel sounds like low self esteem but I'm not here to diagnose anyone \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05", "If they say \"hey I'm going to go take a nap\" that's 100% fine.  If they disappear for 3 hours and leave OP confused about where the fuck their friend went, that sucks.", "Ya know, if you hang up a towel, it'll typically dry out.", "I usually say \"I'm gonna go lie down for a bit,\" but I really think this is dependent on your relationship and the context of the trip. My best friend and I used to live together and when we visit, it kind of reverts back to that. We plan meals together, but we'll both go off at times to do some work, make some calls, nap, etc. I would not bat an eye if she was off napping for a few hours. We behave like short-term roommates because we're both pretty independent, busy women.\n\nEither way, if OP was uncomfortable, clearly this doesn't apply here. I'm only pushing back on the idea that it's rude in every context to leave your friend for hours, even without a warning. I think it truly depends on the trip, the relationships, the expectations, history, etc.", ">but if OP needs something, can they not just get it themselves\n\nI mean sure...if OPs friend didn't make her feel so uncomfortable.", "This completely ignores 2 important things\n1. Privacy\n2. Autonomy\n\n1.If this friend can't even be bothered to stock food, do you think it's fair to say the friend isn't providing much else other than a sleeping area and wifi pw? What if OP wants to make something, or use something like a kitchen tool or entertainment console? What if OP needs to shower, needs bathroom supplies? Should OP just snoop through the house or use things without permission? That's the point of being a good host, providing the things and availability for your guest to make their stay comfortable. \n\n2. Referring back to my above point, you really think if the friend isn't providing these things they are providing in and out privileges (a key) to OP? Considering the friend doesn't have food for OP to eat should they starve and ransack the kitchen? Possibly using stale food, broken kitchen items, what about food items that could have allergens for OP?Oh I get it, as long as you have Uber eats a person should be good right? Friend gets to take a 3 hour nap and OP is basically in jail at her apartment with delivery privileges. Plus if I'm visiting a city/ my friend and they decide they need personal time, I'd take that time to go out! But you can't do that if your friend just randomly goes off to take a snooze without notice. If my friend said hey I'm really tired and gonna nap, I'd be like, okay can you lock the door or can I borrow your key while I go out?\n\nTons of reasons to be a decent host. Not even a good one. Just decent", "I'm confused what you're seeing as over the top here? \n\nThey shower at night and then hang the towel up to dry after they're done- this is a fairly standard procedure imo. The towel has the whole night to dry and then gets packed with everything else. Literally no extra trouble taken to accomplish this.\n\nBringing plastic bags/hamper bags for your dirty clothes is also super normal when traveling, otherwise the clothes that are still clean end up soiled as well when they get mixed together and then everything has to be washed."]}
