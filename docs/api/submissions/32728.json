During the first trimester of the pregnancy, me and my fianc\u00e9 decided to start a new job together for better pay. After a month into our new job became suspicious of my fianc\u00e9 cheating on me with our coworker, Ashley, fake name for privacy reasons. There were a few instances when I saw a Snapchat notification or call popped up on his phone with her name, when asking who it was, became defensive and told me it was a friend. Weird, we were always open about our phone and who we were communicating with. Not long after, our coworkers confessed they saw my fianc\u00e9 flirting with Ashely. I asked about their relationship, but was told my coworker was lying and I should trust him. I kept an eye on him and knew something was happening due to the shift of his behavior. I wasn\u2019t too sure what to think because we were expecting our baby. For a while, situations kept popping up with him and Ashley until finally my boss came to me crying. She knew what was happening and needed to tell me as a friend. With her confession, had the courage to check his phone, found messages between the two and much more. Took screenshots and confronted the two but they never admitted the truth. Last week, we revisit the issue, so we can work on our relationship and build trust. Finally after months of asking, he admits the cheating, this causing a fight and me taking the baby to stay with family. While staying with family, we kept in touch and made plans to stay with each other. Knowing I can forgive him to strengthen our trust and relationship. Two days later, while I\u2019m at work got a message he\u2019s book last minute flight due to family emergency and will be returning on Monday. Turns out, I had his email login and found the confirmation email of a one way flight to Puerto Rico. That was book two days before the departure date. I went home after my shift at work to find all of his belongings, important documents, and our rent money gone. After his first flight landed in Miami, he called me and told me he loved me and was in Texas. I confronted him that I know he\u2019s leaving the country. He reassured me that he\u2019s coming back in couple of days and will help pay the rent before we get evicted since we were a few days late. I\u2019m currently typing this out on a Saturday night not knowing if my fianc\u00e9 will come back from Puerto Rico on Monday or Tuesday morning. We been in contact since he left yesterday and our conversations seem normal so far with updated photos of his trip. Me with everyone I told about the situation believe he\u2019s not coming back. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated. EDIT: I apologize for the grammar, I\u2019m currently typing this out during my break.
