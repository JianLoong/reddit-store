He's had the same hairstyle for most of his life which is a typical length boy's hairstyle, maybe 1-2 inches long with a fade on the side. We do not get along and he is high conflict about every little thing I do.\n\nWell I got tired of the hairstyle and felt it was too long and decided to try and cut our son's hair.  My son refused and said he didn't want a haircut at first, that he wanted his dad to do it, but I figure I am the parent and he is 6, not 13, so I told him this had to be done. After the haircut admittedly it was a bit too short and uneven so I shaved it off and told my son it would grow back fast and I'd make sure not to cut it so short next time.  He was upset at first especially because his older brother started teasing him about it (I put a stop to that) and he got over it, and is fine with it now and just wears a hat or puts his hoodie over it if he is cold.\n\nI took our sons to the exchange with their dad, and immediately my ex takes a look at him and says \"what happened, did he have lice?\" which of course makes my son feel self conscious about his hair again.  I guess my ex must have talked to our son about his haircut because he starts texting me the next day bossing me around and asking me if I could \"try not to cut his hair this way again as our son doesn't like it and it looks bad and there are uneven patches everywhere (which is BS because my son told me he is ok with it now before going to his dads)\".  He also told me he gets his hair cut at a barber and just had it cut 2 weeks prior so he felt it was \"unnecessary\" to \"shave him bald\" and if I feel it is too long I can just \"let him know and he can take him to the barber\". He was also apparently furious because our son told him if I didn't let him cut his hair I was going to take his tablet away.\n\nI got mad and told him I am the parent, to mind his business and stop harassing me about what I do at my own house and that our son was fine with his haircut before my ex started meddling.  Which then prompted him to point to a ridiculous clause in our custody agreement stating that we have joint legal so we must \"consult before radically changing children's hairstyles\".\n\nSo 1) I just cut my son's hair. My ex cuts his hair all the time and doesn't ask me.\n\n2) I don't think shaving a child's hair is considered \"radically changing hairstyles\". I did not dye his hair or give him a mohawk or something.\n\n3) our son was fine with his haircut before my ex started meddling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for just doing what any mom does with their kids??", "created_utc": 1668447226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yv6hb0/aita_for_shaving_my_sons_head_and_not_asking_my_ex/", "score": 1613, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's had the same hairstyle for most of his life which is a typical length boy's hairstyle, maybe 1-2 inches long with a fade on the side. We do not get along and he is high conflict about every little thing I do.\n\nWell I got tired of the hairstyle and felt it was too long and decided to try and cut our son's hair.  My son refused and said he didn't want a haircut at first, that he wanted his dad to do it, but I figure I am the parent and he is 6, not 13, so I told him this had to be done. After the haircut admittedly it was a bit too short and uneven so I shaved it off and told my son it would grow back fast and I'd make sure not to cut it so short next time.  He was upset at first especially because his older brother started teasing him about it (I put a stop to that) and he got over it, and is fine with it now and just wears a hat or puts his hoodie over it if he is cold.\n\nI took our sons to the exchange with their dad, and immediately my ex takes a look at him and says \"what happened, did he have lice?\" which of course makes my son feel self conscious about his hair again.  I guess my ex must have talked to our son about his haircut because he starts texting me the next day bossing me around and asking me if I could \"try not to cut his hair this way again as our son doesn't like it and it looks bad and there are uneven patches everywhere (which is BS because my son told me he is ok with it now before going to his dads)\".  He also told me he gets his hair cut at a barber and just had it cut 2 weeks prior so he felt it was \"unnecessary\" to \"shave him bald\". He was also apparently furious because our son told him if I didn't let him cut his hair I was going to take his tablet away.  \n\nI got mad and told him I am the parent, to mind his business and stop harassing me about what I do at my own house and that our son was fine with his haircut before my ex started meddling.  Which then prompted him to point to a ridiculous clause in our custody agreement stating that we have joint legal so we must \"consult before radically changing children's hairstyles\".  \n\nSo 1) I just cut my son's hair. My ex cuts his hair all the time and doesn't ask me. \n\n2) I don't think shaving a child's hair is considered \"radically changing hairstyles\". I did not dye his hair or give him a mohawk or something.\n\n3) our son was fine with his haircut before my ex started meddling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for just doing what any mom does with their kids??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why not let him have something special with his dad?", "YTA. Most definitely. I remember being a young child, probably 6 ot 7 (I'm 40 now), and hating the way that my parents wanted my hair to be cut. They did what you are doing right now - not respecting his own autonomy, giving him his own choice. He's 6. He's capable of making the decision himself. It seems as if you were jealous that the Dad always gets to cut his hair. You seem to be the issue. If that's the case, grow up.", "YTA, you don\u2019t respect your son or your ex. My ex is a nuisance amongst nuisances but the hair thing between him and our son is they\u2019re thing. Until my son says otherwise, I just complement him whenever his dad cuts his hair. You are on some weird power trip for no discernible reason. Apologize to your son and leave it alone unless he asks for help.", "YTA. Why you think shaving him bald isn\u2019t \u201cradically changing hairstyles\u201d is beyond what I can understand. You literally removed all his hair. He did not want his haircut in the first place & you did this to be petty. Absolutely pathetic and you should be ashamed", "YTA wtf as soon as your son said he didn't want you to do it you should have accepted it. \nSounds like you were doing this to spite your ex.", "YTA\n\nYour sons hairstyle was fine.  You cut his hair against his wishes, threatened to punish him if he didn\u2019t let you cut it, ignored a court order to leave his hairstyle as-is, and justified this to yourself by saying he is too young to get an opinion about his own body.  Then you did it poorly and just shaved his whole head.  Your son clearly doesn\u2019t like it if he always has his head covered (hat or hood).  Your son only told you it is fine because he doesn\u2019t want to get punished for telling you the truth about it.\n\nThen your ex approached the topic in a very diplomatic manner, just asking you not to do it again.  But since you couldn\u2019t just agree to not shave your kids head again, you argued to the point where your ex pulled out the parenting agreement that says you can\u2019t change the child\u2019s hairstyle.\n\nFrom this scenario it doesn\u2019t sound like your ex is high conflict.  It sounds like you are high conflict, and in this situation you tried to weaponize your childs hairstyle against your ex and it blew up in your face.  And now your ex has proof of you violating the custody agreement, should the two of you end up in court again.\n\nBut more than your problems with your ex, you need to take a hard look at how you parent your children.  You are teaching your son that he is not safe with you, and he is not able to tell you the truth, and he will be punished based on your feelings and not his actions.  All of that is wrong and you need to fix your own actions.", "YTA. You bullied your son into a haircut he didn\u2019t want because you are the parent. Your son was never okay with it.

Especially when you forced him by threatening him over his tablet and of course he said that the haircut was fine.
