She doesn't have any hobbies or interests, so if I'm staying with my parents for any period of time we all have to cater to her lack of hobbies. Normally I would want to read a book or play some video games, same for my stepdad. But if we did \"alone\" activities she would be bored. So instead we're all forced to sit on the couch and watch TV that we don't want to watch because otherwise she's all sad about it. Most of the time she falls asleep during the show anyway.

You treated her like a child because that's exactly how she was behaving.", "Nta boundaries", "I tell my kid that only boring people get bored", "NTA.  She IS behaving like a child, needing to be entertained.  Much too high maintenance in my opinion, but if it works for you, best of luck.", "NTA Just because she can't entertain herself doesn't mean you have to give up what you enjoy to be at her disposal.", "Not even remotely TA.\n\nIn my opinion for a relationship to work it requires two fully realized individuals to come together. She needs to be able to figure out what to do with herself when you are unavailable and she needs to be able to let you have time for yourself. She seems not to be able to do either of those things.\n\nYou were giving good, reasonable suggestions. You didn't treat her like a child, though I would argue developmentally and behaviorally she was acting like a child.", "NTA.\n\nShe's doing the \"I'm bored - entertain me!\" routine - which is, in fact, childish.", "NTA and would venture to say that you may be dating someone whose mindset is immature i.e. childish.\n\nI have 2 children and they no longer come to me with the \"I'm bored\" because the minute they do I notify them I'm not here to entertain them.  You handled the response well.\n\nShe's crossing boundaries and expecting you to perform for her.", "NTA. I probably wouldn't have answered. Shot an auto text back or asked if there was an emergency. Don't take this the wrong way, but you both are young. It's not that surprising of an exchange, but I don't think you were out of line.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re bored then you\u2019re boring\u201d- Harvey Danger melodically dropping wisdom", "NTA. Its not your job to engage with her 24/7 and keep her entertained.", "NTA. I think you need to find a grown up to date.", "She is acting like a child and should be expected to be treated as such.  Time for her to grow up and figure out what she wants to do with her life instead of wanting to be entertained.  NTA and do not apologize.", "She's HOW OLD???  \"Moooommmm I'm BOOORRRREEDDDDdddddd....\"  She sounds like she's 12. It was not \"your bad\" to be annoyed by that, because it was REALLY ANNOYING and you were freaking focused and training for a marathon.  NTA.  It's not your job, nor the job of anyone else, to \"un-bored\" her.  Sounds like she should take your advice.", "NTA. She acts like a child so you treated her like one. Literally interrupting you because she is BORED is something a 9 year old does.\n\n\"If you're bored, then you're boring.\"", "NTA. She is acting childish so lol", "NTA, but as someone with a similar partner, the worst thing happening here is that someone who cares about you is reaching out. It\u2019s not like she was intentionally being malicious. Yes, as someone who has to put up similar boundaries, I get that it\u2019s annoying but your response seems like it was harboring a bit of resentment. You could\u2019ve easily upheld your boundary and have been a bit more polite. You did talk down to her, and being passive agressive will not lead to her respecting that boundary more. Just a quick what do you need? Nothing? Ok I\u2019ll call back later. 20 seconds, done. In the meantime, letting these mistakes roll off your back will help leaps and bounds moving forward, not just for your mental state but in upholding future boundaries.", "She tested your commitment to your marathon training and she did not like the result. NTA. On the other hand, she might expect more compassion? Sounds like you were clearly annoyed at her and it can be jarring to be on the receiving end if your words were harsh towards her.", "* Go to a museum.\n* Go for a walk.\n* Read a book. \n* Clean out the closet.\n* Bake some cookies.\n* Do some gardening.\n* Call an old friend.\n* Call mom.\n* Take in a movie.\n* Visit the zoo. \n\nThe possibilities are endless. \n\nAre you sure your girlfriend is 26? She sounds like she's five. NTA.", "NTA honestly thought you were going to be the one to tell her she\u2019s a child but it sounds like you tried to give her the hint that you were busy and should do an activity of sorts", "I know people who are unable to have fun alone. Generally they are not too much fun in company also.\nI would rethink the future of this relationship as I do not wish to be someone's entertainer for life. NTA", "For real, my girlfriend in highschool would pull the \"entertain me\" card but was able to back off if I was busy, and wouldn't pester me. She'd try to start a conversation or chat with me and when I said \"sorry, can't talk now\" she'd say okay and move on. Sometimes with an \"I miss you\" or \"when will you be free\" but still...that's just communicating.", "This woman needs enrichment\nFILL THE GOURDS", "How is this being down voted?", "men and women don\u2019t communicate differently. this is a mature vs immature communication issue. that\u2019s it.", " She knows you don't want to be called,", "Ah its okay!! Maybe my opinion is a minority one!", "Maybe she heard this a lot as a child with mom trying to get her to be more independent. OP is NTA. She sounds exhausting.", "Readers are never alone because they can travel to exotic places, be with intriguing people.", "You were actually very civil and the advice you gave was practical. Does she have a habit of expecting others to entertain her when she gets bored? If so, she needs to think of a hobby to keep her occupied on her own.", "I wish I had enough time in my day to even get close to being bored. Granted, Im an introverted homebody so doing stuff alone is like my default but still. There\u2019s so many different things id like to do in a day but just dont have the time.", "What a weird quote obviously you're most likely to feel lonely when you're alone, its only really an issue if you find that you feel overwhelmingly lonely consistently. The way this quote frames things makes it seem like people should be ashamed for ever feeling lonely.", "unless she has problems communicating her feelings which is something i can relate to but then again shes 26.", "Maybe I\u2019m weird, but I\u2019m rarely lonely when I\u2019m alone. I\u2019m at my loneliest when I\u2019m in a group of people and no one is paying attention to me. \n\nI think at its heart, loneliness comes from a lack of connection. I\u2019ve put in a lot of work the last few years on having a healthy relationship with myself, so when I\u2019m alone, I don\u2019t feel disconnected. But when I\u2019m in a social situation where I\u2019m supposed to be connecting with other people and I\u2019m not, that\u2019s when the loneliness kicks in.", "yeah thats fair honestly I feel like they must be misquoting something because \"If you're lonely when you're not alone, you're in bad company\"  makes much more sense to me", "So it\u2019s OPs responsibility to entertain her forever? She an adult with her own agency is completely unable to entertain herself without a man helping? You are the misogynist here. \ufffc"]}
