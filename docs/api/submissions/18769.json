I don\u2019t think you really talked to her like a child, but an adult who calls someone up (especially someone in the middle of a planned and strenuous activity) complaining of being bored deserves to be treated like a child. I take a lot of annoying teenage shit from my kids, but I\u2019ve told them I will not tolerate any \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d complaints. It makes me crazy.

Just want to give some \"translate this\" analysis, in case you find it helpful and to see if others agree with me.\n\n1. She disregarded the reasonable boundaries you put up. That signals selfishness and disrespect.\n2. She's really childish, calling around and expecting others to entertain her. That's not what grown-ups do.\n3. She is projecting her immaturity on you.\n4. She's being passive-aggressive with you, sulking and giving one word answers. My guess is she wants you to feel guilty instead of owning to her behaviour.\n\nI don't give a judgement on your gf, but her behaviour is toxic on so many levels. And it's on her. It's not your fault. If you asked for advice, I'd say stick to your boundaries better. The fact that nobody picked up the phone when she made all those calls, may indicate that at least some people have the same boundaries as you do, but they actually enforce them.", "NTA, but I guess you are treating her like a child because she's acting like a child.

That's all that is required.\n\nBut that's not how men are hard-wired.  Men are problem solvers.  Your girlfriend has a problem (like \"I'm bored\").
