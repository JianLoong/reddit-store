Exactly how long has he been babysitting for free? \n\nOP needs to stay strong, get physically out of the situation, and go LC or even NC with the sisters. Don't babysit anymore because even if they promise to pay, they won't.", "To be fair, taking care of yourself *is* selfish, but being selfish isn't inherently bad.", "Taking care of yourself is NOT selfish. The definition of selfish is showing lack of consideration for others and being chiefly concerned with one's own profit or pleasure. The word has a negative connotation and being \"selfish\" is inherently bad as it's defined. \n\nWhat I'm talking about is *self-care*. Asserting and taking care of one's own legitimate needs and feelings. It is 100% NOT selfish to do that. \n\nHe doesn't have to ignore and never play with his nieces and nephews. But it's not selfish to refuse to *parent* them as he has been forced to do for many years.", "I fully agree that setting boundaries is not at all selfish. I was meaning more that being a little bit selfish when it comes to self care isn't bad. Being selfish only becomes bad when it rules all of one's behavior.", "NTA\n\nFUCK. AAAALLLLLLLLL. THAT.\n\nYou didn't make those kids. They aren't paying you AND they're asking you to buy shit for them?  The dead ass audacity.  Fuck all that in all the ways it can be fucked.  Don't want to watch your kids? Don't have kids. This is entirely a them problem. Not your circus not your SIX GODDAMN KIDS to watch.  You got to get away from living with them. In the meantime you contribute your fair share to the bills but don't babysit unless you're getting cash OR equal value taken off your share.  Actually...no. Get cash and keep those things separate. But only if you want to watch their kids.", "NTA and you\u2019re not selfish at all. I wouldn\u2019t watch their kids ever given the way they\u2019ve made you the default parent. You\u2019re basically 19 raising 6 kids. That\u2019s not fair. They need to care for their own offspring. Stop watching them and don\u2019t feel badly about not watching them. \n\nYou need to live your life for you.", "NTA\n\nBut it sounds like they don't ask anyway, they'll just leave and expect you to be the responsible person again. You're going to need a plan of what to do when that happens.", "NTA but where are your parents in all of this?", "This. OP, text your sisters, \"I want to make it clear that I am never watching your kids again. You have been leaving them with me for years, making me put my own life on hold to do it, and then guilt-tripping me when I have a life. Moving forward, you are never to leave them with me. If you do, I will call the police for child abandonment, and I will show them this text so they can see evidence that I am never agreeing to watch your children again. Do not send me mean messages. Do not guilt-trip me. Thank me for the many years of unpaid care that I provided for your children. If you do anything else, I'll be blocking you.\"\n\nThen, stick to it. These people are taking advantage of you. Get away from them. Create boundaries.", "x dollars an hour per kid in advance.", "This", "Contact CPS.", "If they do this again, tell them by phone, preferably in text, to get back to get the kids within 30 minutes or you will call the police about abandoned kids. And keep your word. This will teach them fast without you needing to  move out. And where are your parents in alsof this?", "NTA. Your family is taking advantage of you. You are not the parent and are not responsible for watching all these children. Your sisters need to take care of their own kids and should think twice about having more if they\u2019re having trouble taking care of the ones they already have", "NTA.  Congrats on finally standing up for yourself!", "NTA\n\n>They yelled about how I was being selfish and only thinking about myself and not helping them when they really needed me so now I find myself wanting to apologize and agree to start watching the kids again so AITA?\n\nYou are allowed to have a life.   You are not the family designated babysitter, especially without compensation.\n\n>I have been made prime caregiver since I was 5 and it just gotten worse\n\nThis is called parentification and it's child abuse.\n\nDO NOT APOLOGIZE, DO NOT AGREE TO START WATCHING THE KIDS AGAIN.", "NTA.\nYou are allowed to have your own life. Unless you have agreed to watch the kids in advance, you owe your sisters nothing by having your own plans.", "I'm not even going to finish reading. My answer would be MOVE or change your locks. Call the cops next time they ditch their kids.", "Get roommates if you have to, but get a gated apartment and don\u2019t give your family the door code. Make it so they can\u2019t drop the kids on your doorstep and leave.", "Also don\u2019t give them your new address as they will leave the kids on your doorstep and run away.", "NTA. WTH?? Get out. Move out. That\u2019s so unfair for you to take care of all those kids that aren\u2019t yours.", "NTA you have every right to be angry about this. I\u2019m 19 myself and the idea of looking after six kids by myself makes me feel uncomfortable. Even if I was getting paid, six kids is a lot to deal with. Of course, they are family so it may feel appropriate to look after them without expecting them to pay. However, you should at least be aware that you are looking after the kids that day. Could you imagine if you and your girlfriend had left the house without realising there were six kids being left alone? (obviously kids are loud so it probably would have been obvious but still). That would have put those children in serious danger. I wish I could offer you some advice for how to get out of this situation, but unfortunately I have no clue. All I can say is that you are in no way the AH in this situation.", "NTA and also, just so you know, you NEVER have to watch anyone's kids. If a parent willingly abandons their kids (as in they did not make any plans for someone to watch their kids) you're well within your rights to call the authorities and let them know 6 children have been abandoned with you and you don't know what to do with them. This is extreme and should only be done as a last resort.", "NTA they either pay you a salary between the family members up front every month ( at your own discretion which includes a comfortable pay for you, any food, travel and enrichment money for the kids). That is completely up to you if you would rather go down a different route.\n\nOR report them to CPS/child services for child abandonment if they refuse to listen.", "NTA. Tell your sisters that you are not, ever, babysitting their children ever again. Tell them that whenever you see their kids not supervised by (at least) one of their patents or an assigned/hired babysitter, you will call CPS.", "Even most preschools require a 1:4 ratio usually. 1 adult to 4 kids", "You\u2019re missing work, missing time with your gf, and not getting paid. OP you\u2019re missing the best part of being an uncle - you can give them back when you\u2019re done. Your sisters have their wires crossed sorry.", "You tell them slave labour is dead and they have this thing called baby sitters and you get paid for that service you are providing or you will go and enjoy your life which you've put on hold nta", "Move out and go low contact they need to grow up and be responsible. Stop babysitting your sisters kids. They need to be responsible for their own actions and children change your phone number.", "NTA. You need to move.", "NTA\n\nOP, stick to your guns before you lose your GF, your job and your life in general! You're the youngest yet YOU stepped up to help your niblings! That's not your responsibility!\n\nStick to your guns, don't drop your plans for last-minute babysitting anymore. One thing I can tell from this: you will probably be one hell of a father, eh?! GF better hang on to you haha!\n\nNow go on out there and concentrate on your life so you can get out of that house with toxic people using you as a doormat!", "I\u2019m not sure of your financial situation but it\u2019s time you moved out. You\u2019re being taken advantage of. Time for you to start your life .", "Get out NOW!! Like find a cave in the woods to hide kind of now. Like tell your gf you want to leave and see how relieved she is for you now. Like never ever contact them again kind of now. \n\nPlan. Get out. I was forced to be a sibling/parent. It took me too long and it was too late by then. Nta.", "Yeah. I\u2019m seeing some generational issues. Teen moms not being good parents and raising their kids to become teen moms themselves who are not good parents and the cycle continues\u2026 At least the vibe I\u2019m getting."]}
