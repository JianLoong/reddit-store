I have been made prime caregiver since I was 5 and it just gotten worse over time I didn't mind sometimes because I enjoyed being around my nieces and nephews and watching them grow up , but that quickly became a problem when I found myself having to leave my job because someone needed to be there to watch the kids because no one else could. I know you're probably thinking \"what about their parents , can't they watch them?\" you would assume that's the best logic right? wrong. You see I have two sisters with kids 28f with two kids and 26f with four kids.\n\nMy oldest sister was never really a parent to her kids and has even left and went on trips out of state while I was stuck in the house with a newborn baby and my other nephew. My other sister would leave the kids over at the house and magically disappear. I've had times when I have had plans made weeks in advanced and last minute have to cancel because I was stuck at home with six kids.\n\nI would have to be responsible for feeding them , bathing them , getting them to school and making sure they got home safely, ensure that homework was finished and get them to bed all at a timely manner while watching everyone around me go on about their lives while I was just stuck being the caregiver. It wasn't like they would offer to pay me or even ask for that matter they just assumed because I already have been doing it that I wouldn't mind.\n\nThis particular day I had made plans with my girlfriend to go out on a date because we had not been able to hang out in days. She arrived at my house around 2pm so we could get ready to go when all of a sudden I go to tell someone i'm leaving when I realize at some point everyone had left, but the kids were still there. I apologized and we sat there for hours waiting on someone to come back. Everyone got back (5:30) and we immediately rushed out of the house and into the car. We weren't even gone for ten minutes before I was getting spammed with calls and text messages asking when I'd be back to watch the kids and if I could buy them all food when I got back.\n\nI originally was going to tell my girlfriend that maybe we could reschedule and do something another day before ultimately deciding to throw my phone and spend the last few hours we had together. I got back home and it's now 10:30pm and as soon as I got inside I was getting yelled at because they had plans and by me not coming back they had to miss them. I just remember walking away and yelling that I was no longer watching their kids unless they decided to pay me. They yelled about how I was being selfish and only thinking about myself and not helping them when they really needed me so now I find myself wanting to apologize and agree to start watching the kids again so AITA?", "created_utc": 1682617966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13103wp/aita_for_telling_my_family_i_refused_to_watch/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s what you\u2019re *supposed* to be doing at your age and what your parents should have been supporting your whole life.\n\nYour family has been abusing you for many years and you\u2019re finally realizing that this isn\u2019t right. If you are still willing to watch the kids, at prearranged and agreed upon times, then insist on being paid babysitting wages at the going rate. \n\nThey will try to manipulate and gaslight you, since this is what they have always done, so you will have to be strong. *Those kids are not your responsibility and you are not being selfish to refuse to watch them*  (repeat to yourself as often as needed)", "NTA.\n\nWTF? Expecting a teenager watch 6 kids? For free? Glad you stood up for yourself. Be strong enough to stand by what you said. And get out of there as soon as you can!", "NTA move out immediately.

Your sisters' plans aren't paramount over you having your own life. In this instance, it is perfectly okay to be selfish. It sounds like you are still living with your parents. That needs to change. Work, save up your money & move out. Whether into your own place or with housemates. Block your sister's numbers & do your own thing. Because you do deserve your own life.", "NTA. Move out.

If they do this anyway, call the police.", "When they leave the kids there, call the police.  That is child abandonment.\n\nIt was their decision to have kids. You did not have any say in that.

Calle the Police If they dump their Kids in you. \n\nI can proudly say all.of that, because i'm a mother myself (2/4) AMD Sometimes you struggle and have to ASK for Help. Yes, even with Family you have to ask. Everything other than that is called child abondement and that is literaly everywhere a crime.\n\nYou have your own life and choices, No need to Slave yourself for These people (fuck the Village/fuck the we are Family) These people treat you Like a Slave", "NTA you need to set some strong boundaries them, you definitely should not be made to miss work so you can be free childcare. Let them know that they need to schedule in advance if they need childcare and that you have the right to say no if you are busy. I would also recommend saying if  they leave them without telling you, you will carry on with your plan and call the police to report the children as abandoned. Leaving the children without telling you is incredibly irresponsible and dangerous, what if you didn\u2019t realise they had gone and went on your date leaving the children home alone for hours, they need to understand the potential consequences of this", "NTA. You've been parentified, look it up, people often need therapy to recover from it. You can tell them you're not babysitting but I can guarantee they will ignore you.

Not my circus, not my monkeys. I feel bad for the kids.", "NTA. They chose to have kids, they can figure out childcare. It's selfish of them to put it on you. Not your kids, not your problem.", "INFO: Where are *your* parents?", "NTA. Your sisters are 100% the selfish ones, and they are the only ones responsible for the children they have made. You have been used and abused for so long you actually feel guilty for not allowing yourself to be exploited - let that sink in for a minute. \n\nStop letting these people take advantage of you! You are in the right here, and anyone who says otherwise is probably a user themselves. It's not easy to stand up for yourself when you have been conditioned to put up with abuse, but you've taken a huge step forward and that's a good thing! Do not back down on this!", "This is a form of abuse with a ton of projection. Every argument they're making about you being selfish, entitled blah blah is them showing they're smart enough to know what it is, since THEYRE THE ONES DOING IT. They've conditioned you into accepting this \"reality\" and abuse it while verbally abusing you. This is extremely far from normal behavior. Doing what you did is the least you can do for yourself so don't give in. \n\nThese are things that should be communicated, discussed, agreed on, compensated. Not them running out on you. They don't respect you. They don't treat you as an equal. \n\nFuck them.\n\nThe kids are innocent but I feel bad for them. But it's also not your responsibility so don't let them guilt you or use them as pawns to tug at your heart.", "NTA. Never watch them again.", "NTA\n\nI would have called the cops and claimed abandonment! You exercised restraint.\n\nIf you can, find a way to move out. They don\u2019t sound like they will be respectful of your boundaries.\n\nReally though\u2026warn them that unless they can come to an agreement with you this will be considered as abandonment on their part.
