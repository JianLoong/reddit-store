That would still have been a better option...  Not let her tell you anything, you're daughter has the same right to be there as her daughter.

The only reason I had my own bedroom was that my parents couldn't have kids and were able to adopt only me; they would've liked to have had more. And once my parents divorced I shared a bedroom and bathroom with who knew how many people when I stayed with my father---it depended on his current wife/girlfriend's family status.

I've basically never in my whole life had a bathroom for only my use.", "First, my spouse and I discussed the bathroom issue and came to a resultion.

Might be worth checking with your lawyer", "They clearly both need mental help.", "I'm sure there is more to all this, but your wife's refusing to acknowledge her daughter has issues that need to be addressed professionally is ignorant and even unprofessional.  This is not the child's decision, it is hers as the mature parent.  Sounds like you and her daughter got into a contest that should never have been allowed to blossom.

I paid for everything.", "And him paying doesn't make him a saint, there's financial contribution on both sides if it's her house + he's paying for stuff now after he's moved in because he is the earning partner and she's in school.
