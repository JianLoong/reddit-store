That would still have been a better option...  Not let her tell you anything, you're daughter has the same right to be there as her daughter. That happens when both bring in children, doesn't matter if yours wasn't originally living with you. Especially since you got the room. The 14 yrs old doesn't need her own bathroom over night, she can still wait", "NTA. And file for divorce. That's one stuck up ungrateful biatch", "NTA. The expectation that kids have their own bathroom nowadays speaks to the incredible surge in our standard of living recently.", "Sounds like you were kinda over it anyway. NTA.", "NTA You both put your children first which is what parents do.", "Info\n\nSo many questions.\n\nIt was her house but you paid for everything?\n\nWhat was the relationship like btwn the 14 and 26 year old? What was the relationship like btwn your wife and your daughter? Btwn you and your stepdaughter?\n\nWhat was the actual reason why the 14 year old wanted the 26 year old out? What was going on to have a 14 year old threaten suicude,  per your comments?\n\nWhy do you think the nuclear action of moving out without a discussion is the best choice?", "NTA.  You were the cash cow to finance her education, and her house.  She no longer needs you so found an excuse to make you leave.\n\nEdit to add:  I do think you need to talk to lawyer to see if you can recoup the money you put into the renovations, and mortgage you paid into her house.", "Proud of you for putting your daughter first.", "Feel like she used you to pay while she was training ?", "YES.  The daughter 99% of the time would come first.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Good job, Dad!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut you wife sure is. It seems you should kick your daughter out because hers acts like spoiled brat and it's okay in her book.", "She used you for the $$ from selling your house. Now that she doesn't need you , she used your daughter as the excuse to get you to move out. Please get a lawyer ..", "NTA but you should\u2019ve never contributed so much financially to a home that was not in your name. she definitely saw that as an easy way to control the decisions of the house.", "Why did your 26 year old daughter suddenly need a place to live? Does she work? Did your wife agree that your daughter could move in? Was there conflict between your wife and daughter?", "The fuck, you skipped a lot of info.\n\nShe said your adult daughter had a room her under 18 daughter needed, so you both moved out?\n\nYeah, YTA, if for no other reason than how vague and \"r/iamverybadass\" you wrote this.", "Both of you for unilaterally making decisions instead of having a mature conversation. Your spouse is AH for asking your daughter to move out - unless there's a safety situation, sharing a bathroom is a normal life experience. If they're having conflicts it's upto the parents to step in an resolve things. Did you talk to your spouse before leaving with your daughter?\n\nEdit: NTA - From OP'S responses looks like they made a reasonable effort to compromise with their spouse.", "Sooo... you separated from your wife rather than a) tell your well-and-truly-adult daughter to get a job and an apartment or b) tell your wife a 14-year-old can cope without her own bathroom? Srsly?", "No, NTA. You are trying to provide a healthy stable environment for both of your children. Your wife wants you to provide that to only her daughter. You did the right thing by leaving. \n\nJust make sure that if your step daughter approaches you about what is happening, that you show nothing and love and support to her. Don\u2019t burden her with her mother\u2019s problems.", "NTA because I suspect there was more wrong here than just the issues with the daughters.", "Moving out was 100% the thing to do.  Your wife intended for you to go which is why she started this bull shit bathroom thing in the 1st place.  She used you for 3 years and now she no longer needs you.\n\nShe is a far better judge of character than you.  She knew you were the kind of man that would do the right thing for your daughter and that would allow her to separate from you without actually initiating it.  Guilt free move.\n\nDon't forget to file the divorce papers on the way out.", "Wow, this is the shortest post I\u2019ve ever seen on here before", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My daughter took my wife's and my old room. I built a whole new bedroom suite for me and my wife on the 2nd floor. since our split up my spouse tried to get back together but her daughter threatened suicide if we do. I told my spouse to seek help for her daughter.", "Side note - the soon to be ex just completed her masters as a nurse practicioner, studied for licensure exam for 3 months, and passed her boards. A few days later my kid had to go.", "I know; you're absolutely right!\n\nI grew up in a family of three in a 2-bedroom house with one bathroom. The only reason I had my own bedroom was that my parents couldn't have kids and were able to adopt only me; they would've liked to have had more. And once my parents divorced I shared a bedroom and bathroom with who knew how many people when I stayed with my father---it depended on his current wife/girlfriend's family status. Most of my cousins had three, four, or more siblings with only one bathroom and were 2-3 to a bedroom. \n\nNow I share a bedroom/bathroom with my husband, but also have my own room as my office/personal space, as well as my very own bathroom. I love it so much, but sometimes I do feel...not guilty exactly...but I wonder what in the world has happened, and is it necessarily a good thing.", "So true... I've basically never in my whole life had a bathroom for only my use.", "First, my spouse and I discussed the bathroom issue and came to a resultion. She took the 14 year old for a ride to talk with her about it. They came back and my daughter had to go. My daughter, wife, & stepdaughter got along fine. my daughter even babysat while my spouse and i went to jamaica for a week. the stepdaughter threatened suicide if me and her mom got back together. Guessing because of feeling bad she got my daughter thrown out.", "Did you pay for her education? Was there an agreement for her to repay you?", "It feels that way.", "Her daughter had her own room. There are two spare bedrooms on the same floor. There is only one bathroom on that floor.", "Yup, even agreed to times for each and cleaning expectation. One hour later my spouse and her daughter went for a ride.. when they came back my spouse said my daughter had to go because her daughter really needed her own bathroom. So l said good by.", "You sound like an asshole. Dude is paying for everything and receives an ultimatum that his daughter should get the fuck out. He did everything right in leaving that biatch.", "Well she unilaterally decided his daughter was to move out.", "My daughter needed my help and we have the means to do so. she is going back to school to become an RN. I discussed with my spouse the 14 year can share a bathroom, just like my spouse and I do. She said no and to choose, my daughter or her. So I chose my daughter.", "His daughter is 26. She's old enough to support herself. This story has tons of holes. I'm betting there's way more OP isn't saying.", "I know you said the house was a premarital asset, but if you sunk enough money to build a new bedroom suite, are you entitled to getting some of that money back? Might be worth checking with your lawyer", "They clearly both need mental help.", "I'm sure there is more to all this, but your wife's refusing to acknowledge her daughter has issues that need to be addressed professionally is ignorant and even unprofessional.  This is not the child's decision, it is hers as the mature parent.  Sounds like you and her daughter got into a contest that should never have been allowed to blossom.  A child, while needing to be heard, cannot be allowed to rule the roost.", "In the past 3 years, you have gained a lot of equity....  Speak to a lawyer.", "Suckerrrrr", "Move on and be happy leave her in the past your future with your daughter will be amazing on to the next adventure", "Hmm that seems fair, especially as your spouse is not even giving any justification for wanting your daughter out and dishing out ultimatums.", "You miss the part where he moved into *her house*?", "And I said *everyone* sucks for making unilateral decisions.", "You made the right call here.  IMO, you chose the wrong person to marry.", "I suggested as much. She claims to have seen a therapist and discovered she has abandonment and jealously issues with caused the break. However, she is unapologetic and refuses to get help for her daughter because according to her the 14 year won't go?", "Nope, her house. I sold mine and fixed up hers. new York state says pre marital property is not split.", "They are married. It is *THEIR* house. That\u2019s how marriage works. One partner doesn\u2019t to use ownership of property to commit financial abuse in order to get what they want from the other partner.", "That he was paying for everything in so she can't decide all by herself who lives there. He made the right call", "The husband didn\u2019t make the unilateral decision. The wife did. She made the decision that either OP kicks his sighted out or they are getting divorced. Looks she\u2019s getting the best of both worlds now. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re so desperate to make the dad the asshole makes me think you\u2019re the wife.", "All these are things to tell your lawyer, she can be weaponizing her daughter's issues and not dealing with them", "Even if that\u2019s true, which I do not believe it is, she\u2019s about to be a highly paid NP. Get that alimony check!", "Since you renovated every room you do have equity in the house. Get your bag, King.", "Did you pay to fix up hers?  Or was it all her money  that paid  for house maintenance...roof, driveway, etc.\n\nWould you not be entitled to any increase in worth fir the 3 years you lived  there?", "Well it might be the wife's asset but it's THEIR home (or was).", "He's not going to be entitled to alimony. He was only married a few years and didn't quit work to care for kids or be a homemaker at the cost of his career. He was in no way prevented from succeeding by the marriage and it doesn't sound like his standard of life will change post marriage.", "Updated every room, added bathroom, landscaping.. I paid for everything.", "And him paying doesn't make him a saint, there's financial contribution on both sides if it's her house + he's paying for stuff now after he's moved in because he is the earning partner and she's in school. Seems like a fair split, and either way it doesn't give one partner unilateral power to make decisions. My fault was, it seemed to me from the title that OP was the one giving ultimatums and his comments have clarified that wasn't the case.", "Then, you have equity in the house, talk to a lawyer.", "The bathroom your daughter cannot share was actually added by you...NTA at all .....wife is crazy", "I'd  be checking with a lawyer since your money increased  the value"]}
