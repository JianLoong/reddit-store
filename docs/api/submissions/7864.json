Now as a bridesmaid, I\u2019ve suffered twice dealing with Bridezillas and I decided that I would NEVER be one. My friends wanted traditional \u201cfairytale weddings\u201d and didn\u2019t want to be outshone, so their guests had to dress in muted colors and  only certain shades of makeup or else they wouldn\u2019t be allowed in.\n\nI wanted the exact opposite of this, so me and Mike decided to have a \u201cfashion forward\u201d wedding. Everyone is encouraged to wear their most outlandish, colorful and garish outfits just so long as it\u2019s appropriate for pictures (no excessive cleavage for example). We\u2019re even going to have a little fashion show for anyone willing to participate.\n\nMike had the idea of having a club vibe for the after-party, with lasers and smoke machines, because he hates boring weddings, and I loved it.  We told my parents who promised to contribute a lot of money towards the reception and they were horrified. My parents are pretty conservative people so anything but a traditional wedding is out of the question to them. We told them it\u2019s out wedding and we can do what we want, they agreed, but said they don\u2019t have to financially support us.\n\nI said \u201cokay\u201d and went to visit my grandparents. For reference my grandparents are in their 80s and because they lived very frugally, have a crap ton of money they were sitting on. We explained our idea, and what my parents said and they loved it. They were pretty embarrassed my parents were so lame and said they\u2019d support us financially for the wedding. They only had one request, if we could have our \u201cclub\u201d have a \u201cLatin Nights\u201d feel to it. Because they wanted to relive their youth for a night. Grandpa said he hasn\u2019t taken grandma dancing since the 90s and he\u2019s felt horrible about it. \n\nJust so you understand how old my grandparents are, they actually went to Cuba before Castro. They frequently went to clubs like the Copacabana for dancing.\n\nRight away Mike was all for it, I loved the idea too. I pictured a live jazz band playing some Latin jazz and an overall sexy atmosphere. Grandpa was so excited he went to go look for his old tux.\nMy parents got a hold of me and said that I was being ungrateful, petty and stupid for asking for my grandparents money for something so frivolous. They said they\u2019re retirees and prices on essential  things like groceries were going up and they shouldn\u2019t be blowing money on a stupid wedding.\n\nI thought dad was just mad at first I went behind his back to secure funding, but I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s right that they shouldn\u2019t be spending their money on me and I was just being petty.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: It was pointed out to me that I should say we were only asking for $10,000 if that makes any difference to you.\n\nAlso, the fashion forward thing isn't a requirement, it's a suggestion. No one has to participate in the fashion show or dress up if they don't want. I just want everyone to have fun and be creative. I'm having a good laugh at the people saying I'm a Bridezillas for requiring them to read a certain way lol.", "created_utc": 1674254460, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hb404/aita_for_asking_my_grandparents_to_pay_for/", "score": 804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do get where you're concerned and I'd sit down and have a frank and heartfelt talk with grandma and grandpa just to make sure that it won't impact that in a negative way to help you fund your wedding. Tbh your dad almost sounds like he's probably POed bc if they help pay for your wedding he'll get less inheritance.

My parents are helping us pay for parts of our wedding so I won\u2019t dump on you for that. What I do find AH-ish though:\n\n1. Not realizing that in your efforts to not be a bridezilla, you\u2019ve basically come full circle and turned into one. Your guests don\u2019t want to do a fashion show. Aunt Sally doesn\u2019t want to have to plan her most fashion forward outfit and dress up like the Met Gala. She wants to put on a sensible dress and just go to a wedding. I\u2019m so tired or all this pageantry with weddings and I know I\u2019ll get downvoted for that. Yeah, it\u2019s your day, do it how you want but damn. \n\n2.

My parents had some money set aside since I was a child for this. Grandparents didn\u2019t. \n\nWeddings should be about love and family.

But if they\u2019re on a fixed income and relying on their savings as a safety net, it could be very selfish to allow them to spend so much.  Maybe figure out how much you guys could afford on your own, and only accept a smaller supplemental amount from your grandparents if needed.", "YTA and your entitlement is oozing from this post!\n\n\"We told them it\u2019s out wedding and we can do what we want, they agreed, but said they don\u2019t have to financially support us.\"  This is the crux of the entire post.  It is your wedding so finance it yourself!  Ahhh, but you can't!  So you go looking for people who you think have deep pockets to get their money.  You are greedy people who want a big party that you cannot afford so you go around asking people to finance it for you.\n\nHere's a novel idea ..... why not have the wedding & reception that YOU can afford.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents tried to control you, thought you'd cave and have their lame ass idea of a wedding, and are pissed that it didn't work.

Asking your grandparents for help isn't inherently bad (assuming they're cognitively capable of making decisions on their own, etc.). It's also not your dad's money to control. *They're* *your* *grandparents*. Grandparents like spending money on their grandchildren sometimes, especially for big events like these! If they want to have a fun night out dancing, and it just so happens to be at your wedding, they should be able to help contribute if they want! \n\nThe fact that your grandpa wants to take your grandma dancing after all these years should make your dad happy.

I can't imagine that they aren't getting retirement funds of some sort so its not like they're living exclusively on their stored money. That your idea sparked something in them to not only be willing to pitch in, but so much so that they are excited about it? No, this further caps it off. \n\nWeddings should reflect the couple, not anyone else.

Now as a bridesmaid, I\u2019ve suffered twice dealing with Bridezillas and I decided that I would NEVER be one. My friends wanted traditional \u201cfairytale weddings\u201d and didn\u2019t want to be outshone, so their guests had to dress in muted colors and  only certain shades of makeup or else they wouldn\u2019t be allowed in.\n\nI wanted the exact opposite of this, so me and Mike decided to have a \u201cfashion forward\u201d wedding. Everyone is encouraged to wear their most outlandish, colorful and garish outfits just so long as it\u2019s appropriate for pictures (no excessive cleavage for example). We\u2019re even going to have a little fashion show for anyone willing to participate.\n\nMike had the idea of having a club vibe for the after-party, with lasers and smoke machines, because he hates boring weddings, and I loved it.  We told my parents who promised to contribute a lot of money towards the reception and they were horrified. My parents are pretty conservative people so anything but a traditional wedding is out of the question to them. We told them it\u2019s out wedding and we can do what we want, they agreed, but said they don\u2019t have to financially support us.\n\nI said \u201cokay\u201d and went to visit my grandparents. For reference my grandparents are in their 80s and because they lived very frugally, have a crap ton of money they were sitting on. We explained our idea, and what my parents said and they loved it. They were pretty embarrassed my parents were so lame and said they\u2019d support us financially for the wedding. They only had one request, if we could have our \u201cclub\u201d have a \u201cLatin Nights\u201d feel to it. Because they wanted to relive their youth for a night. Grandpa said he hasn\u2019t taken grandma dancing since the 90s and he\u2019s felt horrible about it. \n\nJust so you understand how old my grandparents are, they actually went to Cuba before Castro. They frequently went to clubs like the Copacabana for dancing.\n\nRight away Mike was all for it, I loved the idea too. I pictured a live jazz band playing some Latin jazz and an overall sexy atmosphere. Grandpa was so excited he went to go look for his old tux.\nMy parents got a hold of me and said that I was being ungrateful, petty and stupid for asking for my grandparents money for something so frivolous. They said they\u2019re retirees and prices on essential  things like groceries were going up and they shouldn\u2019t be blowing money on a stupid wedding.\n\nI thought dad was just mad at first I went behind his back to secure funding, but I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s right that they shouldn\u2019t be spending their money on me and I was just being petty.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If they have millions in savings and can easily give you $10k without it changing anything, then it\u2019s fine. But if giving you this money changes their financial situation, then you\u2019re an A.

And the grandparents sound happy to contribute and be a part of it. \n\nI think mom and dad were so upset because they feel the grandparents enthusiasm made them look bad. And they\u2019re right.

Totally their choice. \n\nProbably going to get downvoted, but I\u2019m going with NTA.", "YTA, but at least your grandparents are going to get some fun out of it.\n\nYou are grown adults, the idea you can't pay for your own party is silly.
