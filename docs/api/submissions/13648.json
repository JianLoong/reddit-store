The kid didn\u2019t have a meltdown bc of ice cream it was the thing that broke the camel\u2019s back bc a wedding is almost guaranteed to cause over stimulation which leads more often than not into a meltdown.\n\nHow the parent didn\u2019t recognise this or even seem to think about how it could be a possibility- and then refusing to leave basically keeping your child in a very vulnerable state in front of a whole ass wedding party genuinely makes me angry.\n\nEither way, you handled it the best you could, definitely NTA", "NTA, of course.  His mother should have handled that a lot better and removed him immediately.", "NTA. Wtf? If the kid has regular meltdowns why would she even bring him and then let his meltdown go on for an hour? This is ridiculous.", "NTA  \n\n\nI get that stuff happens, but your cousin should have been willing to take her child out where he/she wouldn't be a disturbance.", "Nta. He was ruining the wedding and his mom should have recognized that and left with him / maybe taken him to get ice cream without being asked by anyone", "Send all their shit back and block them everywhere for ever.  They have demonstrated by their actions they care nothing for you and hubby.\n\nMom should certainly understand her kids needs, special or otherwise, and be prepared to deal with them whenever put in public.  No way should he have been left to continue his melt down at your event.  Take him to the car or their room for him to finish his meltdown.  He could always have come back after (don't know correct terminology for autism) he stabilizes and returns to acceptable behavior.\n\nNTA", "Who was the A h who gave the kid a second and a third piece of cake to chick in the middle of the dance floor?!?! Cake sho be presented to kids ( autistic or not) at the table when their butt is in the seat", "NTA - unfortunate that these people thought it appropriate to interfere with your honeymoon after you'd already had a massive disruption during your wedding. Even more unfortunate that they don't understand how gifts work. I would suggest you go low/ no contact until they are ready to apologize for this nonsense. \n\nIt isn't the child's fault this happened - but asking for him to be taken out of the wedding that he is clearly unable to handle is not \"bullying\" him.", "NTA.  Send gifts back after they pay for the food and everything else that cost you to invite them.", "NTA. Anna should have handled it instead of letting them meltdown in the middle of the reception. Keep the gifts, dump Anna.", "NTA. Parent of an autistic teen here; if the child is having such a reaction they need to be removed from the environment, to somewhere private, calm, and allowed to calm down. You don't just leave them to do such like this. You may not be able to stop the meltdown, but you get them to a safer, quieter, calmer environment where it's not a disruption and most importantly they're not subject to whatever stimulus provoked such.\n\nAlso, in my experience, not having cake with ice cream is not cause for a meltdown. A meltdown is usually sensory stimuli, stress, fear, or such. This sounds like a temper tantrum any child has, but because they're autistic the parents choose to think it's related and don't do anything.", "NTA. The kid's mom should have taken him out right away-like responsible parents do.", "NTA. If any guest has an intrusive meltdown at a wedding (adult, child, neurodivergent or not), it is time for them to leave.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t Macy\u2019s there is no return policy, they want their gifts back then they should have picked it up on the way out.\n\nAlso seriously consider child free events here on out.", "NTA\n\nI have an autistic kid. I have had to leave many situations because my kid was having a meltdown. I remember a particularly bad meltdown at synagogue when my husband had to take kiddo out to the parking lot because he wanted one of the rewards the kids who were graduating from Hebrew school got. It sucks, but it is what it is. \n\nUsually going out to the parking lot and sitting with him for a bit until he calms down does the trick. Sometimes he doesn't calm down. But the rest of the world doesn't stop just because my kid is having a meltdown.\n\nRemoving a kid from the situation that is causing the meltdown is important, too. An hour long meltdown is not fun for the child, either. Most autistic kids are not just little brats throwing tantrums; they are actually overwhelmed and unable to cope with everything going on. Your little cousin needed to go somewhere calmer and less stimulating for his own sake.\n\nI could understand your relatives' concern if you escalated to threatening the cops after five minutes. An hour? And it wasn't even you who threatened!\n\nIf those relatives weren't present for the wedding, likely they are getting a sob story from your cousin-in-law that leaves out the fact that this went on for an hour.

And if is a new way for the son. Why would Anna let her son to continue this behavior for more then 15 min?. You have nothing to apologize for. Anna doesn\u2019t have to apologize for his outburst but for how long she let him do it in front of everyone for so long.", "NTA and Anna was unkind to her son as well as you and your guests. This is not a child who was enjoying himself at your wedding. For him, as well as you, she should have taken him somewhere quiet so he could get away from so much stimulation and calm down.", "NTA, send the gifts back along with a bill for the lost time during the reception and block them. Being autistic isn\u2019t an excuse to have unchecked behavior.  She should have left without being asked.", "NTA Tell them you'll return the gifts when they reimburse you for the reception that was ruined by Anna not parenting her child. Parents like Anna is why people want child-free wedding and events.", "NTA, return the gifts, probably just useless stuff anyway.  and don't forget to drop all the boxes really hard on driveway when you do.", "NTA. Keep the gifts as a consolation prize for that brat ruining your reception, and block these assholes who attempted to shame you.", "NTA! Anna should have removed her child the second he started pitching a fit.

I just feel really bad for the kid that he doesn\u2019t have anybody really supporting his needs.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'd threaten to send them a bill for the ruined reception.", "NTA. Return the gifts and limit contact.", "NTA.\n\nThis is why child free weddings are a thing. Anna should've been responsible in dealing with her child's tantrum and not letting it get so out of hand. This is you and your husband's wedding day and you should  have it how you want. Nobody would be happy if a kid was ruining a valuable moment in someone's life. Autism is the reason for the meltdown, but it's never an excuse.\n\nEdit: Also, keep the gifts.", "NTA. Send them a bill for the dj, cleaning the dance floor & cake and return their gifts.", "NTA I think the right thing not only for you but for the kid is taking him somewhere else maybe a less crowded place to calm him down, it's a really difficul situation having a kid with this condition, but for the sake of the kid his mother should do the best for him and not just stay in the party because she wants to", "For your consideration:\n\nDear Grandma/Aunt/Cousins,\n\nYour presence at our wedding made it one of the most memorable days of our lives.

Ok, I might get down voted to hell but this thing of always blaming autism drives me nuts. Of course autistic kids need care and should enjoy a happy fulfilling life, but what people who use this argument are usually doing is hiding the fact that their child is a brat. You can be autistic and a brat, just as well as being autistic and not being a brat. Anna clearly has no idea how to deal with her child, and because most people are too scared to challenge the 'but he is autistic' defense, she got the family to run with her.\n\nJust to be clear: I am not saying that autistic kids are brats, I'm saying that some children are both and its usually because the parents do not know how to deal with them or coddle them to death.\n\nI would not return anything, but would go LC as I don't think they'll ever have your back.", "Go over to their house, scream for an hour and throw messy food on the floor.
