The kid didn\u2019t have a meltdown bc of ice cream it was the thing that broke the camel\u2019s back bc a wedding is almost guaranteed to cause over stimulation which leads more often than not into a meltdown.\n\nHow the parent didn\u2019t recognise this or even seem to think about how it could be a possibility- and then refusing to leave basically keeping your child in a very vulnerable state in front of a whole ass wedding party genuinely makes me angry.\n\nEither way, you handled it the best you could, definitely NTA", "NTA, of course.  His mother should have handled that a lot better and removed him immediately.", "NTA. Wtf? If the kid has regular meltdowns why would she even bring him and then let his meltdown go on for an hour? This is ridiculous.", "NTA  \n\n\nI get that stuff happens, but your cousin should have been willing to take her child out where he/she wouldn't be a disturbance.", "Nta.

They have demonstrated by their actions they care nothing for you and hubby.\n\nMom should certainly understand her kids needs, special or otherwise, and be prepared to deal with them whenever out in public.  No way should he have been left to continue his melt down at your event.  Take him to the car or their room for him to finish his meltdown.  He could always have come back after (don't know correct terminology for autism) he stabilizes and returns to acceptable behavior.\n\nNTA", "Who was the A H who gave the kid a second and a third piece of cake to chuck in the middle of the dance floor?!?! Cake should be presented to kids ( autistic or not) at the table when their butt is in the seat\n\nEdited to fix typos, and add judgement NTA", "NTA - unfortunate that these people thought it appropriate to interfere with your honeymoon after you'd already had a massive disruption during your wedding. Even more unfortunate that they don't understand how gifts work. I would suggest you go low/ no contact until they are ready to apologize for this nonsense. \n\nIt isn't the child's fault this happened - but asking for him to be taken out of the wedding that he is clearly unable to handle is not \"bullying\" him.", "NTA.  Send gifts back after they pay for the food and everything else that cost you to invite them.", "NTA. Anna should have handled it instead of letting them meltdown in the middle of the reception. Keep the gifts, dump Anna.", "NTA. Parent of an autistic teen here; if the child is having such a reaction they need to be removed from the environment, to somewhere private, calm, and allowed to calm down. You don't just leave them to do such like this. You may not be able to stop the meltdown, but you get them to a safer, quieter, calmer environment where it's not a disruption and most importantly they're not subject to whatever stimulus provoked such.\n\nAlso, in my experience, not having cake with ice cream is not cause for a meltdown. A meltdown is usually sensory stimuli, stress, fear, or such. This sounds like a temper tantrum any child has, but because they're autistic the parents choose to think it's related and don't do anything.", "NTA. The kid's mom should have taken him out right away-like responsible parents do.", "NTA. If any guest has an intrusive meltdown at a wedding (adult, child, neurodivergent or not), it is time for them to leave.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t Macy\u2019s there is no return policy, they want their gifts back then they should have picked it up on the way out.\n\nAlso seriously consider child free events here on out.", "NTA\n\nI have an autistic kid. I have had to leave many situations because my kid was having a meltdown. I remember a particularly bad meltdown at synagogue when my husband had to take kiddo out to the parking lot because he wanted one of the rewards the kids who were graduating from Hebrew school got. It sucks, but it is what it is. \n\nUsually going out to the parking lot and sitting with him for a bit until he calms down does the trick. Sometimes he doesn't calm down. But the rest of the world doesn't stop just because my kid is having a meltdown.\n\nRemoving a kid from the situation that is causing the meltdown is important, too. An hour long meltdown is not fun for the child, either. Most autistic kids are not just little brats throwing tantrums; they are actually overwhelmed and unable to cope with everything going on. Your little cousin needed to go somewhere calmer and less stimulating for his own sake.\n\nI could understand your relatives' concern if you escalated to threatening the cops after five minutes. An hour? And it wasn't even you who threatened!\n\nIf those relatives weren't present for the wedding, likely they are getting a sob story from your cousin-in-law that leaves out the fact that this went on for an hour.

Anna doesn\u2019t have to apologize for his outburst but for how long she let him do it in front of everyone for so long.", "NTA and Anna was unkind to her son as well as you and your guests.

For him, as well as you, she should have taken him somewhere quiet so he could get away from so much stimulation and calm down.", "NTA, send the gifts back along with a bill for the lost time during the reception and block them. Being autistic isn\u2019t an excuse to have unchecked behavior.  She should have left without being asked.", "NTA Tell them you'll return the gifts when they reimburse you for the reception that was ruined by Anna not parenting her child. Parents like Anna is why people want child-free wedding and events.", "NTA, return the gifts, probably just useless stuff anyway.  and don't forget to drop all the boxes really hard on driveway when you do.", "NTA. Keep the gifts as a consolation prize for that brat ruining your reception, and block these assholes who attempted to shame you.", "NTA! Anna should have removed her child the second he started pitching a fit.

I just feel really bad for the kid that he doesn\u2019t have anybody really supporting his needs.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I'd threaten to send them a bill for the ruined reception.", "NTA. Return the gifts and limit contact.", "NTA.\n\nThis is why child free weddings are a thing. Anna should've been responsible in dealing with her child's tantrum and not letting it get so out of hand. This is you and your husband's wedding day and you should  have it how you want. Nobody would be happy if a kid was ruining a valuable moment in someone's life. Autism is the reason for the meltdown, but it's never an excuse.\n\nEdit: Also, keep the gifts.", "NTA. Send them a bill for the dj, cleaning the dance floor & cake and return their gifts.", "NTA I think the right thing not only for you but for the kid is taking him somewhere else maybe a less crowded place to calm him down, it's a really difficul situation having a kid with this condition, but for the sake of the kid his mother should do the best for him and not just stay in the party because she wants to", "For your consideration:\n\nDear Grandma/Aunt/Cousins,\n\nYour presence at our wedding made it one of the most memorable days of our lives.

Ok, I might get down voted to hell but this thing of always blaming autism drives me nuts. Of course autistic kids need care and should enjoy a happy fulfilling life, but what people who use this argument are usually doing is hiding the fact that their child is a brat.

NTA", "YTA, not bc you\u2019re annoyed at the meltdown (that\u2019s on the parents for not identifying that the kid was probably already overstimulated from the wedding to begin with and help him decompress *before* the meltdown even happened, ofc you\u2019re allowed to be pissed about a disruption at your wedding) but bc you threatened to call the cops. wtf dude?? why are you calling cops over a disruptive kid\u2026he\u2019s not a threat, that\u2019s so unnecessarily violent and extreme. \n\nmaybe this is sensitive to me *because* i\u2019m autistic, but there are so many autistic kids who get the cops called on them and get treated like a hardened criminal (forcibly restrained, tased, yelled at, etc.) over a meltdown when in reality they\u2019re just a child. also, the way i grew up, cops were the absolute last option, and known for being violent. so maybe it\u2019s that. but to me it\u2019s just like,,why would you jump to such drastic measures?? asshole move, dude\n\nedit: your sis threatened, not you. mb. however, as far as i\u2019m concerned y\u2019all are on the same \u201cside\u201d so to speak, and obviously you supported it since you didn\u2019t object. i think my point still stands", "YTA let the kid have some ice cream", "OMG I'm not ignoring the situation. In her place I would have removed them earlier, not from that wedding but from maybe a car, or a room. They would recompose themselves and the wedding could continue.", "YTA, but you can always try to get it right on your next wedding.", "Your sister is TA for threatening to call the cops other than that NAH", "As an aside something about the tone of this bothers me and I think it\u2019s because there\u2019s a suggested frustration with the actual autism. A conflation of bad behavior and autism. Probably this wasn\u2019t all about autism actually and I just feel like there is a vague sense anger over the autism. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. As the parent of an autistic child I am sensitive about this. \n\nThat being said I\u2019d take my child outside if he was overwhelmed. So I do get that part of it. \n\nI just feel like there\u2019s a lot going on here and I can\u2019t actually answer the A H part because all the layers are being mixed together.", "This was my take. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to take your kid home - the kid clearly is distressed and not having any fun. Why would you refuse to leave when your kid is having a meltdown in the middle of the wedding?", "This is exactly what I came here to say! I would have been just as pissed, if not more, but calling the cops is a taking it a step too far.", "Same. I can\u2019t believe a majority of commenters are not even raising an eyebrow at the fact the sister threatened to call the cops. \n\nThis is a copy paste from my prior comment but I agree. But saying that you\u2019d call the police to a family member who is not physically harming or endangering anyone is too extreme. \n\nI don\u2019t have context on the wedding venue but couldn\u2019t OP ask whoever is running the wedding to assist?!? Like anyone who is not part of the families. Like having a stranger aka a third party, neutral party would reduced tension.", "I went to many weddings as a child. If people want to have child free weddings that fine but if children are invited then it becomes the parents job to either actually parent their child or leave them home. People say \u201cchildren don\u2019t belong at weddings\u201d when in reality, the parents are to blame for that.", "That's your view but children act like as long as the parent(s) allow it. My cousins and I had plenty of fun at our family weddings and no one acted up (if anything, it would be the adults more likely to ruin shit... as always, especially the one who was getting married)", "Same with my husbands family. Autism is quite prevalent on their side and one of my husbands cousins is severely autistic\u2026 when we have family dos (there\u2019s a lot of family these parties are huge!) they are loud, overwhelming and socially awkward as a lot of the time we haven\u2019t seen so many of them for a while\u2026 and that\u2019s just us who aren\u2019t on the spectrum! So for my cousin in law they give him an iPad. Then they give him sound blockers. Then they take him out of the room. And if it gets genuinely too much, they make their exits and say goodbye to remove him from the situation. \n\nNot only is OPs cousin not helping her kid in the situation, Im finding it difficult to understand why she would want her child to be so distressed\u2026. It would be like someone having a panic attack and not helping them to breathe\u2026. When my cousin in law has started to become overwhelmed, my aunty and uncle in law are there within seconds to take every step to never let it get to this point for not only his sake but everyone else\u2019s too\u2026.", "As a former kid, I can confirm that they usually either overstimulate or understimulate. Not fun", "Exactly. Nothing bad ever happens. Everyone is always nice and reasonable. No one, not a single person feels entitled to anything. Every parent is a saint who does nothing wrong and every child is an angel.", "I had a friend who did this. We\u2019re no longer friends because of it.", "It definitely is crazy to ask for the gifts back - but sometimes it\u2019s worth doing something like that just to remove them from your lives.  \n\nI would tell them they have to pay for shipping, though.  That might be enough to shut them up.", "I would take the high road and just send the gifts back And then cut contact. No reason for prolonging the agony", "And an itemized bill for the reception, honey moon, also a heartfelt letter of how this ruined their day OP dreamt of since she was a child given to the entire family! Throw footage of the hour long meltdown in there too for good measure.", "My parents were absolute champions when I was a kid.  We had game plans, planned quiet spaces ahead of time with hosts, and being told upfront what I needed to be present for.", "Aw, glad there was a happy ending but that poor kid... \n\nMeltdowns are awful. I've described it before as being a lot like throwing up-- you don't WANT to do it in the first place, if it happens you've probably been feeling awful for a while leading up to the event, and if you HAVE to, the last thing you want is to do it in public where everyone has to see you going through the worst and most disruptive thing you could go through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, agreeing that OP is very much NTA-- Anna should have been looking out for her kid. Not only did she fail to get him away before he hit an overload, she couldn't even remove him to a safe/quiet place once it happened. She made her child's suffering a public spectacle, which can be traumatizing. To this DAY I can remember times I had meltdowns where I couldn't get somewhere safe or private.", "The people mover and the train ride in disney are my favorite decompression spots.  The whole place is so overwhelming, but these are cool, relatively quiet soothing rides, its a stimming happy place for me.  I have no idea why.  But we all need a spot to do that, and the weirder the place, the better the story ;)", "Even as an infant our grandson would get agitated at family dinners....my daughter would put him in his crib and he calmed right down. With autistic kids you learn as you go, and no two are the same.", "I disagree\u2026as the parent of an autistic child, I totally understand his frustration.  However, it is very lonely place to be\u2026this may be her only \u201csocial\u201d time\u2026and she may have needed it.  Hard shoes to walk in on all sides.", "This. God*damn*it the music at weddings is always blaringly, frustratingly, stupidly loud. Ugh.\n\n(Not autistic, but my ADHD gives me similar symptoms. I usually have to leave weddings halfway through to have a moment to calm down.)", "If nothing else, send the cousin the invoice for the cleaning and the cost of the cake. Both of those are on her for not tending to her child better.", "I wouldn\u2019t send shit back. A wedding gift is a wedding gift and they\u2019re officially married. No take backs.", "I'm a whole ass neurotypical adult, and take myself away when I have had enough at a family gathering, holiday gathering or large group. I isolate and read for a while, take a walk, etc. I am just not fond of loud, noisy and sometimes drunken crowds. OP is not the jerk for being both disappointed and disgusted with the kid's mom, and should not return the gifts, they came for the show - and got one.", "It\u2019s really funny in my extended family. All my cousins kids are as introverted as me so once they hit 8 my escape space at parties turned into the no talking reading room", "I find this trend just revolting.", "I was born in early 2000s and where I'm from we transitioned from the ps2 to online delivery a lot slower! social media is really a new tool for parents to get lazier. seeing parents post their children' most private moments from literally videos of them being born is so invasive. theres gonna be a new term for this in psychology circles in 20 years.", "NTA. the only ah here is anna who took her child to a wedding she probably knew he couldn\u2019t handle. forcing an autistic child to be in a position that can cause overstimulation is like torture for us. that poor kid. and i feel really bad for you too, not being able to do your dance bc the floor was a mess", "NTA but his mom is. As an autistic person, if i were clearly overwhelmed and having a meltdown then i\u2019d hope my parents would take me out of that situation so i can calm down. She knows better than to think it can just go away without something changing in his environment; it\u2019s not a time locked event lol\n\nI\u2019m sorry your wedding was so thrown off course and that it was taken as bullying the kid. As time passes (not right now, it\u2019s understandable to still be upset) please try not to hold it against him though. Big events can be a lot; his mom shouldve helped him and not let a meltdown become a spectacle and disturbance to your wedding", "NTA,\n\n I'm not even autistic and my husband asked me if I wanted to leave a restaurant yesterday because I wasn't coping with the excess stimulation. We took our food to go. Why did that poor boys parents not intervene? when your child has got to the point that they are that upset surely you want to take them home to their safe space? I recently had my wedding reception and my Aunt took my cousin (autistic) home when she noticed that he had clearly had enough and he was no where near this level of upset. I don't understand how you would let it get ro that point, let aline let it continue for an hour in the middle of someone's wedding. \n\nAs for the family I would refuse to give the gifts back, that's not how gifts work. You can tell them your side of the story and just say to then you will be keeping the items that were gifted to you as you wernt aware they came with strings and that you won't accept any future gifts from them for this reason.\n\nI'm sorry that a portion of your reception was tarnished by this, I know how hard people work and how much money people put in to making these things the best day of their lives,\n\nTry not to blame the child, but definitely blame the parents", "It doesn't matter if kiddo is autistic or not, the kid tantrums majorly disrupting a big day, then as a parent they need to take charge and leave or remove said kid to a quiet space to allow bride & groom to have their wedding.\n\nThat being said, mum might have been struggling with the boy because he was overwhelmed but it was best all round to leave at this point. the wee guy would have only gotten worse with music and flashing lights etc\n\nOn return from your honeymoon maybe reach out and have a chat with her. Just now it's raw but the only family members need to stay out of it, they'll make things ten times worse.\n\nNTA op, you shouldn't have to deal with kids that's the parent's job.", "Honestly, no one sounds particularly pleasant in this story....", "I legitimately thought that was the norm! Atypical or not. Kid\u2019s throwing a tantrum at ANY gathering? Get their ass in another room until they calm down. It benefits both kid and party.", "Hell, I'm an adult and I think weddings are extremely boring. I'm glad I'm finally out of the age where everyone's getting married.", "are you kidding? her 4/5 year old RAN AWAY and it took this person until their small child was fully off the premises to notice and go searching for him. there\u2019s no reason to excuse that type of parenting where your child is literally completely unsupervised at a large event that\u2019s horrific", "I agree actually... I think sometimes it's easier for some people to give up their own power. Just my opinion", "its been trending for as long we could capture images (paintings, photos) i just wanna hug crying children...", "You were \u201cabout to cry\u201d because some kid was throwing a fit? Sounds like you have your own emotional problems. ESH", "Exactly what I was thinking. \n\nShe was exposing him to continuous stimuli that caused him great discomfort, if not pain, until he literally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He probably wanted to leave five hours ago. And she likely does this quite often if this is his family\u2019s reaction.", "Hey, I bet you\u2019re doing great.", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "And throw away the box they originally came in.", "You have more power and autonomy than you believe.  I hope you understand that someday for your sake.", "Can I come join that room? I love quiet reading but I have a kid and quiet reading doesn\u2019t happen for me\u2026."]}
