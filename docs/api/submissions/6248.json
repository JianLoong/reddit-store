If you ask them, they survived WW2, when it wasn't that bad. Our grandma was overly protective and tired having to take care of kids again. But nothing extreme. Her health rapidly declined in their early teen years. I was out of state so I wasn't a physical caregiver. I was power of attorney so I was a financial caregiver while they took care of the physical needs.\n\nKatie was going to drop out of high school. She barely graduated. This is important for the future.\n\nOnce she graduated her and Kenzie came to me. They said they wanted to put grandma in a home so Kenzie could take a manager position, and Katie wanted to get out of town, go to our state capital, take classes at a community college and transfer to their selective university. She said a teacher who knew her situation believed she had potential to get there and become something great.  They said it wasn't possible when caring for grandma.\n\nI told them no.\n\nThey've resented me since. Katie went to a community college in our town and flunked out right away. After grandma died, she went back and has been doing alright. She fell into a depression after her boyfriend cheated on her. She was talking about it to Kenzie and myself and said the thing that hurt was the person he cheated with was beautiful, talented, and then she said his affair partner actually goes to her dream school...she said this girl was everything she should had in life, well - rounded high school experience, parents to support her, a great education, and now this girl had truly taken everything from her. Then she mentioned she should have been at that school, but she was wiping the ass of something who called her every name in the book for 2 more years longer than she should have.\n\nThis isn't the first time she's been tipsy and made a passive aggressive comment, so I told her 'Katie, I'm not the reason you couldn't get into your dream school, you failed out right away from CC, and would have did the same thing there. you weren't ready and can't accept that'. Kenzie told me I was an ass who didn't understand burnout. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Guys, it seems I need to redirect you all - the question is not am I the ass for having them care for grandma, it's not taking blame for Katie chasing a crazy dream and going to her dream school!!

And they were forced to physically care for her, while you held all financial power over them. And have the gaul to say \"it wasn't that bad\".", "YTA.  Let me get this straight:  You had the financial and legal power to find a way to get professional care for your grandmother, who was at that time unable even to toilet by herself.  You chose, instead, to leave her in the hands of two untrained young adults.  They had an extra job on top of their other jobs and education, a job they were not trained to do, a job that the two of them had to divide between themselves, 24 hours a day, so there was never any relief from being around somebody who \"calls them every name in the book.\"\n\nAnd you have the nerve to blame them for being so stressed out and tired that Katie flunked out of college?\n\nNo wonder they resent you.  You asshole.\n\nETA: Just read some of your replies.  You left them to look after a heavy-bodied person WITH DEMENTIA.  You left her in the hands of a couple of barely-not-kids.  On the basis that before she developed dementia she would have recognized them.\n\nWhile you went off and did...whatever.\n\nHow, precisely, were you a \"protective grandson?\"", "After more information YTA, let's see. You forced teenagers barely out of highschool to take care of their dying grandma who may have very well been abusive. Not to mention she had dementia. So you also stopped her from getting professional care so you're an AH for that too. Because you didn't want her to feel abandoned. Even though you weren't there. Then you insulted your sister because she was bitter about the situation you forced on her.", "Question why did you say no to putting her in a home?", "YTA. \n\nInstead of doing the responsible thing and placing Grandma in proper care you left two teenagers responsible for Grandma. All while they were trying to graduate and be teenagers. At no time was it appropriate for this to happen. When Grandma's health starting declining when they were young teenagers someone needed to step in and assist them. They still needed raising! \n\nIt also sounds like grandma was abusive and you dismiss this as \"it wasn't that bad.\" \n\nAnd since you were in charge of the finances...how much did you pay them for caregiving services and how much did they get once grandma passed?", "Yta\n\nShe wasn't ready for school, but sure was ready to take care of an elderly woman?\n\nKarma will always come for people like you.", "YTA \n\nfor everything. \n\nThe girls could have made it. This is just so sad! Of course they were burnt out and tired from caring for grandma. I have seen dementia up close- it isn\u2019t pretty. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what they went through. They weren\u2019t health care professionals. A person with dementia who needs toileting help needs professional help. \n\nYour teenage sisters needed to be focusing on their studies instead of this. They definitely could have made it if they weren\u2019t experiencing burn out as they say. \n\nThey need therapy and more help moving forward. I hope they can go back to school and get back on track. They need someone in their corner and believing in them- you sure weren\u2019t and aren\u2019t.", "YTA- you are 20 years older than your sisters. They should not have been forced to play nursing home for their grandmother while you were off living your life and doing *whatever it is you do*. \n\nYou did, indeed, ruin their lives.

Of course you think that- you disappeared", "> 'Katie, I'm not the reason you couldn't get into your dream school, you failed out right away from CC, and would have did the same thing there. you weren't ready and can't accept that'.\n\nThis is complete rubbish. When she failed community college she was also one of the primary caregivers for a high needs dementia patient. She had no chance of doing well, all while you were out of state doing nothing to help. It is entirely your fault that she had no chance of getting in to her dream school. YTA\n\nWhat was your reasoning for refusing to put her in a home?", "YTA. You ARE the reason your sister didn\u2019t get to go to her dream school. You refused to help your sick grandmother and forced your much younger sister to take on the role of caregiver\u2014a role that you wouldn\u2019t take on yourself.  Do you know how hard it is to take care of a sick adult who cannot take care of themselves?  Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m 36 and am my dad\u2019s caregiver. I cannot imagine an 18 year old having to do what I do while also attending school. It\u2019s no wonder she flunked out!\n\nAlso, stop minimizing what your sisters went through when your mother went to jail. From what it sounds like, your grandmother did not want to raise either of your sisters, but took on that role because she didn\u2019t have a choice. Obviously, you weren\u2019t going to take care of them. Your sisters had to know their grandmother didn\u2019t want them. They also had to know you didn\u2019t either. Shame on you.", "YTA. I'm paid to wipe the asses of angry older pts and I can tell you that it's not the job for two teens who were abandoned up to that point.

YOU helped to derail your sister\u2019s life. \n\nYou expected and forced your sisters to do the care you yourself were not willing to do. And now you are not to blame?? Of course you are.\n\nAnd you have the audacity to mouth back to them about it not being your fault? Gtfo", "So much YTA in this post I don\u2019t even know where to begin\n\nYou claim it wasn\u2019t that bad for them even though you didn't live with your grandmother and weren't even near enough to visit on a regular basis. For all you know she could have been abusive towards them.\n\nYou refused to put your grandmother in a place she could get proper care because 'she family' yet you wouldn't lift a finger to help. Throwing money at a problem isn't the same as living with it day in and day out. \n\nYou forced you teenage sisters to stay in an environment they obviously weren't qualified to deal with when you had other options, even after they asked you.\n\nKatie did badly in high-school and college while taking care of her grandmother, but is doing perfectly fine now that she's gone and you seriously don't get why she blames you for her false start? \n\nI don't even know what to do with that level of selfishness. I'm  thinking the sister that disowned the family had the right idea.", "Yta, why didn\u2019t you move back and physically take care of your grandma?", "YTA. You are abusive. You used your money to force two teenage girls to care for your abusive grandmother; you forced them to sacrifice their futures because you were too stingy and lazy to do the work yourself. Shame on you. No wonder your other sister cut you off.", "YTA for this 1 reason. They did not want to be caregivers and you forced them to stay in that position. \nSome of your sisters anger is misplaced but you also did them wrong and took time away from their life.", "YTA\nAnd cruel", "YTA. You seem to have a thing where you minimize the trauma of others. You had grand parents that survived the war but the war \u201cwasn\u2019t that bad\u201d?? Having also had grandparents that survived the war who \u201chad it easy\u201d they still witnessed and experienced a lot of things that were vile examples of humanity. Those things stuck with them until the day they died. \n\nYou forced your teenage siblings to care for an elderly woman with dementia when you could have given your grandmother the proper care she needed and your sisters the life they deserved to have. What they did with that life was up to them, not you. \n\nTo answer your edit, yes you are the AH for preventing Katie from chasing her dream which was not unreasonable in the least.", ">the question is not am I the ass for having them care for grandma, it's not taking blame for Katie chasing a crazy dream and going to her dream school\n\nIt is the same question because by denying them the care their grandmother needed you held them back.\n\nYou are absolutely to blame.

I hope Kenzie and Katie disown you.\n\nYou are the absolute worst kind of family member to have. Abusive.  YTA.", "YTA for not taking responsibility. Maybe she failed out of community college is because she was taking care of a dying woman while taking classes. Where were you while these young ladies were taking care of your grandmother?", "YTA, go volunteer with dementia patients and then apologize to your sisters. It doesn't seem like you were ever around dying dementia patient, because then you'd understand it's impossible to take care of them and do well in school.", "Even if your sisters had landed with a truly remarkable caregiver and had every possible support, losing both parents at a young age would be likely to have some lasting effects. Similarly, caring for someone with dementia is deeply traumatic even if that person is not unkind. The idea that your sister's struggles with school (which, by the way, are common and not a moral failing) are unrelated to this is complete BS. YTA, take responsibility for your cruelty.", "YTA for forcing your sisters to care for your grandma and basically give up their lives and what they wanted. That\u2019s selfish. A home would have been better suited for everyone in that scenario.", "YTA. Yes, I have read your original question. YTA for telling your sister it\u2019s not your fault when in fact you played a significant role in the direction her life took by not helping when she asked for it. Caring for an elderly person with dementia is incredibly demanding (physically and emotionally). That\u2019s why people hire professionals to do it. No wonder she flunked out, poor kid. On top of that, you belittled her aspirations and accepted no responsibility despite your own admission that it was your choice not to put Grandma in a home. I reiterate: YTA. It is your fault.", "Since you want so bad someone to answer your question, yes YTA for telling your sister that beacause IT IS absolutely your fault. Poor sisters.", "Yta. Because you're wrong. She failed out of CC because full-time caring and school was too much to handle. Which is why she wanted to leave in the first place!! You forced them to care for grandma instead of paying for it like the \"finacial caregiver.\" Funfact: using teenagers as slaves is not finacial care giving. Its abuse. YTA for the rest of the post too, but this was just answering the specific posted question.", "YTA you actually have no idea how Katie would have done at her dream school instead of stuck taking care of grandma, attending a school she didn\u2019t want to and likely angry and/or depressed about the whole situation.", "Also, let\u2019s say the girls were 4 and 6 when placed with grandma. You would have been around 24 at that time. Definitely old enough to step in and raise your two siblings instead of leaving them with an old woman who was tired of raising children. It sounds like you\u2019ve been too selfish to help these girls when they needed someone to look out for them and love them. Shame on you.", "YTA your edit is irrelevant because it's a factor that plays a part in why you're the asshole for saying it. Stop deflecting. Your sister could have done well in the other state if she wasn't stuck home wiping yours grandmas wrinkly ass.", "Omgggg.  YTA from the original post.  A bigger AH with the edit. And your comments make you one the biggest assholes ever.  There are really no word for how big an AH you are now and then. You don\u2019t leave high school kids to care for elderly who can\u2019t physically care for themselves. In answer to your redirect, yes YTA and had a big impact on where your sister is today and no going to her dream school because you forced her to take care of someone who should have been cared for professionally and not by teenagers who should have been focused on high school. AH x a million.", "YTA.  What you seem to not be understanding is that the very reason your sister had trouble at community college is BECAUSE she was caring for the grandmother.

Very rarely am I so disgusted by a post.\n\nCongratulations.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cIf you ask them, they survived WW2.\u201d Probably because they had their family torn apart in a very traumatic way and had their older brother disregard them right along with it.

You took away an old woman's dignity, who you claim to have cared for, and you did it at the expense of your sisters while you and solely you benefited from exploiting them.

She wanted to go to a specific school, she was motivated and happy, and you took it away from her. She failed CC because, thanks to your actions, she was not where she wanted to be, her head was not in the right place and she had no motivation to study. She was depressed. And that is all on you.

You weren't there to be the daily caregiver, you basically forced them to deal with it. Being a daily caregiver can be EXHAUSTING and thankless, especially if the person is combative (whether due to personality or disease). By forcing Katie (and Kenzie I presume) into this role, she had to delay her own life. By the time she started that life, she was mentally (and physically) drained - not the best way to start, so she was STARTING well behind the starting line and had to try to catch up. Without support - she burned out quick probably trying to get her life on the track she foresaw in the shortest amount of time possible and she couldn't do it. Is she blameless? No, but neither are you. What right did you have to force them to take care of grandma while not lifting a finger yourself? did you at least try to get a professional caretaker in for her to give them a break? did you ever show up yourself so they could take a break?", "You are a horrible sister.

Since you updated your post to specify that you want the ruling to be solely based on you not taking the blame for Katie not going to her dream school, let me spell it out for you:\n\nTaking care of someone with dementia is a BIG job. It is also emotionally draining. \n\nYour sisters were tasked with this job without their input or consent. And despite this, still tried to pursue other things, ex: Katie going to community college.\n\nYou seem to think the fact that she flunked out of community college her first try at it is proof positive that it was a foolish dream for her to have wanted to put your grandmother in a nursing home so she could focus on her studies and transfer to her dream school.\n\nWhat you\u2019re failing to recognize is that YOU set Katie up to fail. The chances of her scraping through community college under the circumstances that she was in, are AT BEST, extremely slim.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t been so selfish and self justified in offloading your grandmother onto your sisters, then Katie\u2019s educational plan very potentially could have been successful.\n\nYou are absolutely the asshole for failing to take ownership of what you did to your sisters, recognize the impact it had on their lives and apologize for it", "YTA.

Of course she wasn't doing well in school, you sabotaged that! Grown ass adults have a hard time juggling jobs and elder care, how is a teen/young woman supposed to magically do it better?!\n\nAlso to your comment regarding inheritance: there is no amount that can replace her missed opportunities.

I can't even begin to imagine what these young girls went through.", "Don\u2019t forget, according to OP, the girls didn\u2019t have it all that bad. \n\nHe is an utter AH.", "Dude's off twiddling his thumbs and pretending nothing's wrong while both his youngest sisters struggled to care for a grandparent, hold jobs, and go to school. \n\nMajor AH vibes here.", "Sounds like OP is the apple that didn\u2019t fall too far from the family tree, ran off and left everyone else to handle all the real problems, just like good ole dad did.", "I love how he says \u201cnow the real question, please\u201d like those two aren\u2019t related.  Hope his dream school didn\u2019t involve Cause and Effect cause he certainly didn\u2019t get in on that", "YTA, OP. \n\nI haven't been the caretaker of someone with dementia, but I watched my father go through it caring for his mother with dementia, and that shit is *H. A. R. D.*. Its brutal, and people with dementia can often be abusive. My grandmother was one of those, she would call us \"every name in the book\" while deriding everything about us, screaming obscenities non-stop, and was racist AF on top of that mess just to give it a nice ole cherry on top. Its mentally and emotionally exhausting. I cant even begin to imagine the toll it took for two teens to have to deal with any of that, much less dealing with it for *years*. \n\nYou say that you couldn't uproot *your* life to take care of dear ole grams, but you had absolutely no problem sacrificing your sisters' lives for it. And why *exactly* couldn't you have moved grams to where *you* were to look after her that way? I'm guessing that was too much of an inconvenience for you, but you still didn't mind inconveniencing your sisters. \n\nThere is absolutely no question that your youngest sister's struggles with school were directly related to having to be a caretaker for grams. A responsibility that was *yours* that you opted to neglect and foist off on them. *You* were financially secure, *they* were not. *You* had the resources, stability, and *LEGAL POWER* to care for grams. *They* did not. Your sisters have every right to resent the hell you for what you've done to their lives. \n\nAs for your condescending AF \"redirect\"; no one here is missing the subtext. *You* are the one failing to see how one is a direct result of the other.", "YTA it literally took your grandma DYING for her to be in the right space to do well in school and you don\u2019t think she would\u2019ve done that before being forced to endure more trauma longer than necessary because you\u2019re selfish? You have never had your sisters best in mind and it shows by toning down the abuse they faced at the hands of a person you forced them to care for. You weren\u2019t even in the same city as them. You have no idea how hard their lives were because all you care about is the money. I hope she graduates school and goes no contact with you the same way your other sister did. You are the problem", "the $$$ is all he protected", "OP, you know it, the whole fucking world knows it, YTA YTA YTA\n\nYou made your young sisters carry the burden you sure as hell didn\u2019t want to, so much so that it was detrimental to their future. And then you had the nerve to blame them for their setbacks!!! \n\nYTA, a despicable human at that.", "If I was one of the girls, I would have left anyways and essentially forced OP to figure out the care for the grandma.", "You said this perfectly!", "If I were one of the sisters, I would have left at 18 and made grandma OP's problem.", "YTA.  And yes, you are the reason that she flunked out of school - you used a child to do horrible labour for you because you were too lazy to uproot your own life OR pay to help her.  She had to suffer verbal abuse, wipe her grandmothers ass, and begged you for help and you turned her down.  **This is all on you and your horrible management of the situation.**", "My heart breaks for them. I helped care for my grandmother as she got older while I was in college. But we had home health and a large family support network and she had all her faculties still. I can't imagine what it was like for those two kids. And their jerk brother states away saying oh its not that bad.", "This asshole didn't even properly throw money at the problem, he just ordered his teenage sisters to deal with it instead of getting the professional care she needed.", "Right? Why is he trying to redirect like he is not the AH in every way", "Excellent question", "Selfishness", "He replied to another comment with \u201cI was married at the time and out of state. I couldn\u2019t uproot my life. I helped them financially so it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d He probably didn\u2019t want to lose any of the inheritance", "Those girls should have just left anyways and left it to be OP's mess.", "This!!\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "Not only that, the OP neglected to provide proper medical care (nursing home) for his grandmother with dementia. A nursing home could have made grandma more comfortable, taken care of daily meals, updated medications, and had doctors on hand to see how things were progressing. And when things got out of control (ie verbal abuse, cussing, etc.....) there could be staff there to handle it who are properly trained to deal with situations like that. \n\nIf the OP was concerned about nursing homes in general, the younger siblings could have visited grandma regularly to make sure everything was okay. But to force them into caretaking roles? That's unconscionable.", "I wonder if they can apply for (through the state) or sue OP for back wages. In some states, the state will pay you a stipend for caring for a disabled family member.", "Look I read your update and you are still the AH.  She flunked out because she spent all her time caring for your grandmother why you sat hundreds if not thousands of miles away.", "Question, why didn\u2019t you live with grandmother? Since it wouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal. What prevented you from living with her? You could\u2019ve moved in to help. Why did you not do that?", "You don\u2019t know that. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE BECAUSE YOU ARE 2 decades older and didn\u2019t have the same experience. Please go to therapy or back to kindergarten to learn some basic empathy.", "being blunt and not censoring is usually a way to say \u00a8im an asshole but you cant be mad about it\u00a8", "You can't possibly know that. You weren't there.\n\nYou abandoned your sisters while they were children and forced them to be caretakers to an incompetent, abusive adult. That's abuse and you're dang lucky it didn't get reported to authorities while it was happening. \n\nAnd, yes, that makes you directly responsible for your youngest sister's subsequent academic failures and mental/emotional health struggles. In case that isn't clear.", "She had dementia! How the hell do you even know what she said to them? Have you ever dealt with anyone that has dementia? They can be very abusive. You wouldn't know since you obviously didn't want to be bothered.", "She had dementia.  My grandmother had that and she  could get downright nasty. Some of the stuff she said was horrendous.   You need to stop talking about things you know nothing about. You weren't there. You have no idea.", "You don\u2019t get to decide if that\u2019s abuse. You didn\u2019t live through it or even seem to care to inquire what was going on in the girls lives.", "And yet\u2026 you never stopped to think *why* your mom turned out like she did?", "That's how people who weren't around my grandma described her. Here's the reality that you don't want to admit: she WAS abusive. Firm & outspoken are code words for abuse. But you weren't there so I suppose it didn't happen.", "He should pay the equivalent of back wages for two qualifed 24 hour care nurses. With overtime pay.", "OP having trouble with people not behaving how he tells them to. \ud83d\ude44", "This was almost exactly what I was going to post after I saw his edit completely missed the point. But I doubt anything anyone posts is going to change his mind.", "I hope they will", "Could you blame them?\nNope", "The fact that OP mentions Katie has been doing well in community college since their grandma died should be a huge sign\u2026 definitely TA. I heard a stat recently that taking care of an elderly parent (guardian) takes a HUGE toll on mental health (as you\u2019ve mentioned in your reply). It\u2019s quite malicious to make a teen/young adult go through that when you have the financial resources to help.", "OP understood how stressful it was, which is why she washed her hands of the situation and just controlled the money: which she did not use to get grandma proper care. Instead she stole any real opportunity from her sisters.\n\nShe is in fact the exact reason her sister was unable to follow the (apparently crazy?) path of going to school full time.\n\nYTA.", "And then had the audacity to throw \"flunking out of community college\" in his sister's face. \n\nGood for her for even attempting to go to school to better herself! I don't look down on her in the slightest for not being able to do well. She had a lot of other responsibilities, and had begged this buttface to relieve her of some of them (putting grandma in a care home) and he was like \"Nah, you got this!\" while not actually having to do any of the care himself.", "I'm pretty sure that both of them will.  And dude here will just.  Have no idea why.  Because what he did to his little sisters \"wasn't that bad.\"", "\u201cProbably me\u201d means you didn\u2019t even look into it. YTA on so many levels. You gave no fucks and they should resent you.", "That would be wonderful revenge.", "I think at least Katie (youngest) was still a minor when the dementia got bad enough that the care burden switched to the girls caring for grandma. I think OP is deliberately leaving out details because he knows dang well he's wrong.\n\n1. He described grandma's \"rapid\" health decline as starting in the girls' \"early teens.\"\n2. He mentions Katie planning to drop out of high school with no explanation as to why.\n3. He mentions Katie's plan is supposedly because a teacher who worked with her directly \"knew the situation\" and believed that she would be successful with a community college transfer to selective 4 year college plan. That means even the teacher recognized plenty of academic ability and extreme circumstances that were interfering with academic success. And, the teacher suggesting this plan be done in a whole different city suggests than teacher thought Katie needed to be kept away from the existing home life for success.", "Also, they were adults to care her grandma but not enough to be trusted and supported to go to the college they wanted. And you\u2019ve not the empathy to shut your mouth when she\u2019s hurt because of her boyfriend cheating with the kind of girl she would have liked to be\u2026 OP, as a big sister who deals with a difficult relationship with a sister who blames her for everything, yes, YTA\n\nThis stinks.", "I work with the aging population and it is very likely that a caretaker will develop health issues and at times pass before the one whom they are taking care of if there is not the needed support from others.", "OP is male", "OP is a man, which in some ways, makes this all the worse.", "So you think it is ok for him to just dump it all on two teenagers??? \n\nHe could have moved back to his grandma's and taken the primary caregiver role on. He could have looked into medicaid and medicare to help cover the costs. Instead he left it completely up to two teenagers to take care of and then has the nerve to tell his younger sister she would have failed no matter what.", "BS\n\nOP had grandma's power of attorney. He should not have accepted that if he was unwilling or unable to take proper care of grandma. Accepting the power of attorney literally does make him responsible, and that responsibility is a burden he freely accepted.\n\nAlso, grandma's decline started when both girls were young minors. She was clearly not an acceptable caretaker for the girls at that point. OP would definitely have had a duty to at least report this to social services so that the girls could get a new caretaker. (Someone who is not competent to manage their own affairs is, by definition, not competent to independently care for and manage the affairs of minor children.) He chose not to do the right thing to protect his fantasy of being a good grandson to a loving grandmother.", "Uh, no. He was a full adult who could & should have done the work to find all of the options available to care for grandma. Instead he shifted her care to his sisters who were obviously unprepared & able to give her the care she needed. He was thinking & acting selfishly & now doesn't want to hear or admit that he is at fault for the consequences of *his* choices.", "I agree nursing homes are expensive BUT considering the age of the grandma, they could have liquidated assets and medicaid would have taken care of the rest (know from experience) would have that been a housing issue for the sisters? Yes but OP could have easily helped with that and one was trying to take a promotion at work  that would have helped with a decent apartment for them.", "He had power of attorney. That means he was the directly responsible guardian of the grandmother. It was literally his job to ensure she was cared for.", "100% and as a teacher I can testify to how quickly outside complications will derail a smart student.", "Don't thank the one person who tells you what you want to hear instead of the truth. \n\nI read your post & update so I'm going to answer your question. \n\nYes, YTA because YOU are the reason she couldn't go. You left them to care for your grandmother while doing whatever you wanted. Therefore you put them behind the eight ball. The only thing you got right was calling yourself an AH because you most definitely are at fault since there were other choices to care for your grandmother other than the one *you* chose.", "This OP's alt account?", "Check the ages again & really think about the power imbalance in play here. Julia went NC for a reason. The minors left to care for their grandmother weren't equipped to make decisions like you're suggesting. Guilt & responsibility is hard to get over when the people in your life who are supposed to help & care for *you* leave & make you be the caregiver to someone you really shouldn't be caring for to begin with.", "OP was power of attorney. POWER. OF. ATTORNEY. Meaning ALL care, was their responsibility and they only did half the job. OP was directly responsible for the actual care of the grandmother, and they unloaded that onto teenagers. This started when they were in their teens. OP should have gotten a social worker who would have started the process of finding someone for the girls, aince the girls were in the care of their grandmother, and getting grandmother care. And OP FAILED at their literal job they were entrusted with. What arent you getting about this? They didn\u2019t even attempt to start that, they literally kept their dementia ridden, heavy bodied grandmother in the care of literal teens. \n\nIt\u2019s a WONDER they even graduated.", "He had power of attorney over the grandmother's finances. So he should have been using it to pay for for sufficient care. He told his younger sisters they could not put her in a home and then didn't even pay them for the round the clock care they provided for an elderly, incontinent dementia patient. Yes that's forcing them. They were barely out of teens so couldn't get a decent job, were trying to go to college and OP Is the one who told them NO.", "He forced them. That's who. He was an adult who left them to care for their grandmother instead of looking into other options where nobody was left in a bad position. He chose not to do that & instead took the selfish route which he has admitted to. They're not lucky here because they've gotten the short end due to the choices of OP.", "They probably would have been better off if OP had disappeared. Then, there would have been a better chance for a social worker or caseworker checking in on them and seeing that grandma needed to move to professional care and the girls needed a new caretaker until they turned 18.", "they were orphaned minors and she was their guardian. they literally had nowhere else to go", "Keep taking these well deserved down votes!  \n\n\nOP had all the money and all the cards.  \n\n\nBTW, he did disappear because he sure the hell wasn't helping.", "They would have to get rid of assets to qualify for Medicaid ie no money left for inheritance", "Has to be or his wife\u2019s who think they are saints because they held the purse strings.", "Or that the response from redditors is the same either way.", "And the inheritance is important why again?
