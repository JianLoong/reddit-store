If you ask them, they survived WW2, when it wasn't that bad. Our grandma was overly protective and tired having to take care of kids again. But nothing extreme. Her health rapidly declined in their early teen years. I was out of state so I wasn't a physical caregiver. I was power of attorney so I was a financial caregiver while they took care of the physical needs.\n\nKatie was going to drop out of high school. She barely graduated. This is important for the future.\n\nOnce she graduated her and Kenzie came to me. They said they wanted to put grandma in a home so Kenzie could take a manager position, and Katie wanted to get out of town, go to our state capital, take classes at a community college and transfer to their selective university. She said a teacher who knew her situation believed she had potential to get there and become something great.  They said it wasn't possible when caring for grandma.\n\nI told them no.\n\nThey've resented me since. Katie went to a community college in our town and flunked out right away. After grandma died, she went back and has been doing alright. She fell into a depression after her boyfriend cheated on her. She was talking about it to Kenzie and myself and said the thing that hurt was the person he cheated with was beautiful, talented, and then she said his affair partner actually goes to her dream school...she said this girl was everything she should had in life, well - rounded high school experience, parents to support her, a great education, and now this girl had truly taken everything from her. Then she mentioned she should have been at that school, but she was wiping the ass of something who called her every name in the book for 2 more years longer than she should have.\n\nThis isn't the first time she's been tipsy and made a passive aggressive comment, so I told her 'Katie, I'm not the reason you couldn't get into your dream school, you failed out right away from CC, and would have did the same thing there. you weren't ready and can't accept that'. Kenzie told me I was an ass who didn't understand burnout. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Guys, it seems I need to redirect you all - the question is not am I the ass for having them care for grandma, it's not taking blame for Katie chasing a crazy dream and going to her dream school!!

And they were forced to physically care for her, while you held all financial power over them. And have the gaul to say \"it wasn't that bad\".", "YTA.  Let me get this straight:  You had the financial and legal power to find a way to get professional care for your grandmother, who was at that time unable even to toilet by herself.  You chose, instead, to leave her in the hands of two untrained young adults.  They had an extra job on top of their other jobs and education, a job they were not trained to do, a job that the two of them had to divide between themselves, 24 hours a day, so there was never any relief from being around somebody who \"calls them every name in the book.\"\n\nAnd you have the nerve to blame them for being so stressed out and tired that Katie flunked out of college?\n\nNo wonder they resent you.  You asshole.\n\nETA: Just read some of your replies.  You left them to look after a heavy-bodied person WITH DEMENTIA.  You left her in the hands of a couple of barely-not-kids.  On the basis that before she developed dementia she would have recognized them.\n\nWhile you went off and did...whatever.\n\nHow, precisely, were you a \"protective grandson?\"", "After more information YTA, let's see. You forced teenagers barely out of highschool to take care of their dying grandma who may have very well been abusive. Not to mention she had dementia. So you also stopped her from getting professional care so you're an AH for that too. Because you didn't want her to feel abandoned. Even though you weren't there. Then you insulted your sister because she was bitter about the situation you forced on her.", "Question why did you say no to putting her in a home?", "YTA. \n\nInstead of doing the responsible thing and placing Grandma in proper care you left two teenagers responsible for Grandma. All while they were trying to graduate and be teenagers. At no time was it appropriate for this to happen. When Grandma's health starting declining when they were young teenagers someone needed to step in and assist them. They still needed raising! \n\nIt also sounds like grandma was abusive and you dismiss this as \"it wasn't that bad.\" \n\nAnd since you were in charge of the finances...how much did you pay them for caregiving services and how much did they get once grandma passed?", "Yta\n\nShe wasn't ready for school, but sure was ready to take care of an elderly woman?\n\nKarma will always come for people like you.", "YTA \n\nfor everything. \n\nThe girls could have made it. This is just so sad! Of course they were burnt out and tired from caring for grandma. I have seen dementia up close- it isn\u2019t pretty. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what they went through. They weren\u2019t health care professionals. A person with dementia who needs toileting help needs professional help. \n\nYour teenage sisters needed to be focusing on their studies instead of this. They definitely could have made it if they weren\u2019t experiencing burn out as they say. \n\nThey need therapy and more help moving forward. I hope they can go back to school and get back on track. They need someone in their corner and believing in them- you sure weren\u2019t and aren\u2019t.", "YTA- you are 20 years older than your sisters. They should not have been forced to play nursing home for their grandmother while you were off living your life and doing *whatever it is you do*. \n\nYou did, indeed, ruin their lives.

Of course you think that- you disappeared", "> 'Katie, I'm not the reason you couldn't get into your dream school, you failed out right away from CC, and would have did the same thing there. you weren't ready and can't accept that'.\n\nThis is complete rubbish. When she failed community college she was also one of the primary caregivers for a high needs dementia patient. She had no chance of doing well, all while you were out of state doing nothing to help. It is entirely your fault that she had no chance of getting in to her dream school. YTA\n\nWhat was your reasoning for refusing to put her in a home?", "YTA. You ARE the reason your sister didn\u2019t get to go to her dream school. You refused to help your sick grandmother and forced your much younger sister to take on the role of caregiver\u2014a role that you wouldn\u2019t take on yourself.  Do you know how hard it is to take care of a sick adult who cannot take care of themselves?  Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m 36 and am my dad\u2019s caregiver. I cannot imagine an 18 year old having to do what I do while also attending school. It\u2019s no wonder she flunked out!\n\nAlso, stop minimizing what your sisters went through when your mother went to jail. From what it sounds like, your grandmother did not want to raise either of your sisters, but took on that role because she didn\u2019t have a choice. Obviously, you weren\u2019t going to take care of them. Your sisters had to know their grandmother didn\u2019t want them. They also had to know you didn\u2019t either. Shame on you.", "YTA. I'm paid to wipe the asses of angry older pts and I can tell you that it's not the job for two teens who were abandoned up to that point.

YOU helped to derail your sister\u2019s life. \n\nYou expected and forced your sisters to do the care you yourself were not willing to do. And now you are not to blame?? Of course you are.\n\nAnd you have the audacity to mouth back to them about it not being your fault? Gtfo", "So much YTA in this post I don\u2019t even know where to begin\n\nYou claim it wasn\u2019t that bad for them even though you didn't live with your grandmother and weren't even near enough to visit on a regular basis. For all you know she could have been abusive towards them.\n\nYou refused to put your grandmother in a place she could get proper care because 'she family' yet you wouldn't lift a finger to help. Throwing money at a problem isn't the same as living with it day in and day out. \n\nYou forced you teenage sisters to stay in an environment they obviously weren't qualified to deal with when you had other options, even after they asked you.\n\nKatie did badly in high-school and college while taking care of her grandmother, but is doing perfectly fine now that she's gone and you seriously don't get why she blames you for her false start? \n\nI don't even know what to do with that level of selfishness. I'm  thinking the sister that disowned the family had the right idea.", "Yta, why didn\u2019t you move back and physically take care of your grandma?", "YTA. You are abusive. You used your money to force two teenage girls to care for your abusive grandmother; you forced them to sacrifice their futures because you were too stingy and lazy to do the work yourself. Shame on you. No wonder your other sister cut you off.", "YTA for this 1 reason. They did not want to be caregivers and you forced them to stay in that position. \nSome of your sisters anger is misplaced but you also did them wrong and took time away from their life.", "YTA\nAnd cruel", "YTA. You seem to have a thing where you minimize the trauma of others. You had grand parents that survived the war but the war \u201cwasn\u2019t that bad\u201d?? Having also had grandparents that survived the war who \u201chad it easy\u201d they still witnessed and experienced a lot of things that were vile examples of humanity. Those things stuck with them until the day they died. \n\nYou forced your teenage siblings to care for an elderly woman with dementia when you could have given your grandmother the proper care she needed and your sisters the life they deserved to have. What they did with that life was up to them, not you. \n\nTo answer your edit, yes you are the AH for preventing Katie from chasing her dream which was not unreasonable in the least.", ">the question is not am I the ass for having them care for grandma, it's not taking blame for Katie chasing a crazy dream and going to her dream school\n\nIt is the same question because by denying them the care their grandmother needed you held them back.\n\nYou are absolutely to blame.

I hope Kenzie and Katie disown you.\n\nYou are the absolute worst kind of family member to have. Abusive.  YTA.", "YTA for not taking responsibility. Maybe she failed out of community college is because she was taking care of a dying woman while taking classes. Where were you while these young ladies were taking care of your grandmother?", "YTA, go volunteer with dementia patients and then apologize to your sisters. It doesn't seem like you were ever around dying dementia patient, because then you'd understand it's impossible to take care of them and do well in school.", "Even if your sisters had landed with a truly remarkable caregiver and had every possible support, losing both parents at a young age would be likely to have some lasting effects. Similarly, caring for someone with dementia is deeply traumatic even if that person is not unkind. The idea that your sister's struggles with school (which, by the way, are common and not a moral failing) are unrelated to this is complete BS. YTA, take responsibility for your cruelty.", "YTA for forcing your sisters to care for your grandma and basically give up their lives and what they wanted. That\u2019s selfish. A home would have been better suited for everyone in that scenario.", "YTA. Yes, I have read your original question. YTA for telling your sister it\u2019s not your fault when in fact you played a significant role in the direction her life took by not helping when she asked for it. Caring for an elderly person with dementia is incredibly demanding (physically and emotionally). That\u2019s why people hire professionals to do it. No wonder she flunked out, poor kid. On top of that, you belittled her aspirations and accepted no responsibility despite your own admission that it was your choice not to put Grandma in a home. I reiterate: YTA. It is your fault.", "Since you want so bad someone to answer your question, yes YTA for telling your sister that beacause IT IS absolutely your fault. Poor sisters.", "Yta. Because you're wrong. She failed out of CC because full-time caring and school was too much to handle. Which is why she wanted to leave in the first place!! You forced them to care for grandma instead of paying for it like the \"finacial caregiver.\" Funfact: using teenagers as slaves is not finacial care giving. Its abuse. YTA for the rest of the post too, but this was just answering the specific posted question.", "YTA you actually have no idea how Katie would have done at her dream school instead of stuck taking care of grandma, attending a school she didn\u2019t want to and likely angry and/or depressed about the whole situation.", "Also, let\u2019s say the girls were 4 and 6 when placed with grandma. You would have been around 24 at that time. Definitely old enough to step in and raise your two siblings instead of leaving them with an old woman who was tired of raising children. It sounds like you\u2019ve been too selfish to help these girls when they needed someone to look out for them and love them. Shame on you.", "YTA your edit is irrelevant because it's a factor that plays a part in why you're the asshole for saying it. Stop deflecting. Your sister could have done well in the other state if she wasn't stuck home wiping yours grandmas wrinkly ass.", "Omgggg.  YTA from the original post.  A bigger AH with the edit. And your comments make you one the biggest assholes ever.  There are really no word for how big an AH you are now and then. You don\u2019t leave high school kids to care for elderly who can\u2019t physically care for themselves. In answer to your redirect, yes YTA and had a big impact on where your sister is today and no going to her dream school because you forced her to take care of someone who should have been cared for professionally and not by teenagers who should have been focused on high school. AH x a million.", "YTA.  What you seem to not be understanding is that the very reason your sister had trouble at community college is BECAUSE she was caring for the grandmother.

Very rarely am I so disgusted by a post.\n\nCongratulations.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cIf you ask them, they survived WW2.\u201d Probably because they had their family torn apart in a very traumatic way and had their older brother disregard them right along with it.

You took away an old woman's dignity, who you claim to have cared for, and you did it at the expense of your sisters while you and solely you benefited from exploiting them.

She wanted to go to a specific school, she was motivated and happy, and you took it away from her. She failed CC because, thanks to your actions, she was not where she wanted to be, her head was not in the right place and she had no motivation to study. She was depressed. And that is all on you.

You weren't there to be the daily caregiver, you basically forced them to deal with it. Being a daily caregiver can be EXHAUSTING and thankless, especially if the person is combative (whether due to personality or disease). By forcing Katie (and Kenzie I presume) into this role, she had to delay her own life. By the time she started that life, she was mentally (and physically) drained - not the best way to start, so she was STARTING well behind the starting line and had to try to catch up. Without support - she burned out quick probably trying to get her life on the track she foresaw in the shortest amount of time possible and she couldn't do it. Is she blameless? No, but neither are you. What right did you have to force them to take care of grandma while not lifting a finger yourself? did you at least try to get a professional caretaker in for her to give them a break? did you ever show up yourself so they could take a break?", "You are a horrible sister.

Since you updated your post to specify that you want the ruling to be solely based on you not taking the blame for Katie not going to her dream school, let me spell it out for you:\n\nTaking care of someone with dementia is a BIG job. It is also emotionally draining. \n\nYour sisters were tasked with this job without their input or consent. And despite this, still tried to pursue other things, ex: Katie going to community college.\n\nYou seem to think the fact that she flunked out of community college her first try at it is proof positive that it was a foolish dream for her to have wanted to put your grandmother in a nursing home so she could focus on her studies and transfer to her dream school.\n\nWhat you\u2019re failing to recognize is that YOU set Katie up to fail. The chances of her scraping through community college under the circumstances that she was in, are AT BEST, extremely slim.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t been so selfish and self justified in offloading your grandmother onto your sisters, then Katie\u2019s educational plan very potentially could have been successful.\n\nYou are absolutely the asshole for failing to take ownership of what you did to your sisters, recognize the impact it had on their lives and apologize for it", "YTA.

Of course she wasn't doing well in school, you sabotaged that! Grown ass adults have a hard time juggling jobs and elder care, how is a teen/young woman supposed to magically do it better?!\n\nAlso to your comment regarding inheritance: there is no amount that can replace her missed opportunities.

Do you realize what they loss? How this affected their education, social life, and burnout? Those years are where she is supposed to figure herself out and learn her wants. I doubt either sister really got a chance to do this. Once your grandma died they had a massive catch up to figure out what they want and learn how to fix their damaged education.

They were not adults. \n\nI love that OP claims that it wasn\u2019t that bad. \n\nListen OP. You exploited your minor sisters. You made them provide free labour so that you could reap the rewards. Of course your sister failed out school. Can you imagine the strain she was under?\n\nYes. It\u2019s your fault. It\u2019s completely your fault.

I'm sure you did your best to care for him, and if he'd had the same cognitive ability as he did prior to the dementia, he'd have thanked you and been very grateful for your efforts.\n\nBut to add on: even professionally-trained caregivers are taught to take time away from mentally/emotionally and physically draining patients like your father and OP's grandmother. In properly-staffed facilities, professionals are given rotating shifts for patients like that specifically so they *don't* get burnt out as quickly (or at all, hopefully).\n\nAnd OP saw fit to leave two young women alone, untrained and with little to no valuable assistance (oh sure he gave them money, but compared to all the physical, emotional, and educational help they needed? That's *nothing.*) to care for a potentially-abusive elderly woman with dementia.

She was already neglectful and a tad emotionally abusive prior to becoming sick, but after she would lash out so bad that I would get physically sick from all the stress. She passed a little under a year ago. I had stepped down from caring for her shortly before my 21st birthday which caused a huge fight within the family, mainly my sister who didn't want to step up and my mom who claimed I didn't care about her. I gave up going to my dream school, I gave up, I gave up having a career, I gave up having the chance to move to be with someone I love so much, I gave up sleep, I gave up my physical/mental health. Only to get called every single name in the book, threatened, insulted, have my trauma used against me, be slapped, had things thrown at me, etc. I only stepped down because I was pregnant at the time. I couldn't care for my babies health if I couldn't care for my own. They needed me to be healthy for them to thrive. They relied on my body, and I wasn't going to continue sacrificing it for someone so ungrateful. My siblings and father didn't truly realize how much work it was taking care of her until I stepped down and moved out within weeks. I was gone maybe a week when she got an infection from improper medical equipment cleaning. A week is all it took for them to eventually end her life after I had to learn how to do it all on my own at 16 because I had the most maternal/caregiver instincts according to them. One mistake is all it took, and she spent the last few months of her life contained to a hospital bed barely lucid. When you're someone's caretaker, all it takes is one bad day or mistake. If you've never been in that spot before, you don't understand how easy it can be to seriously injure or kill someone you're taking care of. My siblings and father had each other. I had no one helping me. Only one of them has apologized to me for not understanding before. He always wondered why I would look dead tired or would be easily annoyed. It's cause I was physically and emotionally exhausted. \n\nThe good news is my hair finally started growing back thicker this past summer. It's no longer falling out from stress. I'm not sickly pale anymore. I feel happy and healthier despite how crappy this past year was. I'm actually sleeping well for the first time in my life. I cried so much the first day I moved out. I finally felt safe and at home for the first time in my life. No worrying about getting screamed at. No worrying about being insulted or having to dunk to avoid flying objects.

Will that give her a boost so she can push through and succeed? No. Yuck Op.   \n\n\nGoogle how much a home care worker gets paid for the level of care your Grandmother needed, then calculate how much time they worked for her.

You downplay how difficult it is to care for an elderly person. I can tell you from experience, as my grandmother is partially dependent on help for almost everything. I sometimes have to take care of her. She's a tiny 99 year old that is mostly lucid but is developing dementia and wakes up in the middle of the night at least once an hour. When taking care of a dependent elderly, you take care of meals, showers, clothing, toilet trips and diapers, tucking them into bed, medicine, checking vitals, going to help as soon as there's trouble and keep them grounded in time, place and self as much as you can. I'm almost 22, have had to take care some times since I was 16, and the last two weeks I've been looking after her by myself. I haven't slept well a single day. And she's nice most of the time, even if she is a drama queen. Now imagine that, without parents helping you, not having enough time to even do your school work, dealing with the mental stress of it and ON TOP OF THAT that the person you're taking care of is calling you every name in the book. No wonder she's depressed. No wonder she has no self esteem. There's a reason why there are TRAINED PROFESSIONALS for this exact type of thing. The least you could have done was hire a nurse. You didn't just trouble your sisters, you put your grandmother at risk. It *is* YOUR fault for leaving her and her sister to care for a sickly elderly woman by themselves.

I self supported financially from age 16, put myself through 54 ER admissions in 4 years and two surgeries, sepsis and had to work on top of looking after myself.\n\nI went from the highest grades in my school being encouraged by teachers to apply for the Ivy equivalents to putting myself through the equivalent of community college to get my GED for 5 years and I still didn\u2019t get it. I did eventually get into college via the mature student route and crashed and burned after 7 years of this intensity. I had no idea how to ask for accomodations, financial help and was in survival mode.\n\nI ended up homeless by 25 having got into a university in the top ten in my country (via emigrating) and my tutors could not grasp \u2018you are a smart girl. Exceptionally. But your grades keep dropping.

The one time I was not sick, financially secure and not being abused my grades were off the charts\u2026\n\nI imagine being care giver for an abusive grandma with dementia while your abusive sibling fucks around with POA is very similar on burn out scale.

I still owe student loans for \u2018my first degree\u2019 which have no illness or crisis exemption so cannot take loans again. I do not have the money to pay for a part time degree upfront unless I win the lottery or gain a benefactor.

A lot of families really ramp up financial abuse when kids are trying to complete education that they can escape via because it is more likely to trap them in the family enmeshment forever.\n\nI am no contact with my parents. I wish I had known more about this dynamic when younger because a lot of what they did was also illegal. My mum fucked around with a POA when I was an adult and it was catalyst for estrangement. And I reported it to the body who oversees them here. My understanding is that did not go well for her as she had done the same for a non family member.

I've actually been on a cocktail of medicine since I was 16. What I didn't mention here but have in the past on reddit is the mom I'm referring to is my adoptive mother. Old family friend who took me in at 16 before officially adopting me. Things were bad there but not nearly as bad as prior to my adoption. I made the best I could with the shitty hand I was dealt in life and it paid off in the end mostly. What made me stick around so long was mainly gratitude for being taken in when I had nowhere else to go. I knew it wasn't right. I wasn't obvious to how abusive she was, but I stuck it out telling myself it's the least I could do to repay the debt I owed and that it was an improvement from before at least. I've went no contact with my adoptive father earlier this year after he pulled a lot of BS that finally pushed me to my limit. My siblings have become more understanding luckily, but one of them I never blamed, she couldn't grasp the full extent of what was going on or the burden it was. Over the past year, my tolerance for things has gone down a lot, which has caused a lot of riffs with people in my life. I don't go out of my way to be mean or start fights or anything, but I won't brush off subtle insults disguised as jokes or let people ignore my boundaries anymore. I've had to tell people my life is my own, and unless they are me or my husband, what I choose to do with it is not their concern. The biggest complaint was me no longer bending to please everyone else when they can't even bother to check on me every once in a while unless they want or need something. \n\nThat and I'm no longer willing to \"lend\" out money. Everyone in my adoptive family is pretty poor. When I got with my husband they insited I \"lock him in\" because he is very well off. I was disgusted at the fact they were pushing me to marry him as soon as they figured out he had money. I didn't fall in love with his money and there has been times we struggled. At one point he got laid off and we were barely able to feed and house ourselves before he bounced back to a even better position. If I was just with him for money, I would've left when we were surviving on rice and ramen with our heat cut off because we couldn't afford the bill. \n\nAnyhow, since before we were even officially together he gave me full access to his bank account and gave me one of his spare credit cards. We've known each other since we were just toddlers and he could see I was struggling to feed a family of 6 (my mom would waste all the money on random stuff for her so I worked odd jobs to keep our bills paid and food on the table). My siblings helped as well with that at least but had just as bad spending habits, so they weren't super reliable on that front. I actually started falling for him after being attracted to him since I was just a preteen because he cared so much. He gave it to me so I could take care of not only myself but my siblings. The fact he cared enough about me to know how much I love them and wanted to provide for them, for him to provide for them too when I needed the help really stuck with me. He didn't have to do that. He gave me access with no requirements or in exchange for anything. He didn't expect me to do anything in return. He did eventually start trying to woo me by bringing me things I liked, taking me on little trips to give me a break from being a caregiver (he paid to have a professional come watch my mom whenever he stole me away for a weekend), made sure I had everything I could want or need. I'm stubborn to a fault, so it was a fight to get me to accept him spoiling me but he never gave up. He was content to keep providing for me even if I didn't want him as more than a friend. Well, with that came issues, though. My family would complain about me using his account to get myself anything personally saying it's his money but the moment they wanted something suddenly \"Well he told you, you can use however much you want for whatever you want so why won't you buy this for me/us?\" As soon as we officially got together, they started trying to take advantage of him. It got worse when we got engaged. He's selfless, so he never told them no. I eventually started putting my foot down more and more about \"lending\" them money because it was going from $20 for gas to $1000 for some random hobby. Suddenly, I was labeled a \"gold digger,\" selfish, I \"turned my back on family,\" etc. I refuse to let them wring us dry and put ourselves in a bind because they want a new TV or some other stupid thing. I've offered to get them food or help with bills if they really can't afford it, but that's not the actual problem. Hell I'm literally paying the property taxes on my grandmother's house now since she passed so it can stay in the family even though I have absolutely no interest in ever living there and it's not even in my name. It's still never enough, and I've realized how little I actually mean to a lot of \"family,\" so I put in the same amount of effort as they do for me now.

I\u2019m not understand why you prohibited this or why you felt so pressed to force her to stay in the situation but it seems malicious. You were correct when you said you are a jerk and you are indeed selfish, you\u2019re condescending and inconsiderate.\n\nHonestly if you ask me you didn\u2019t deserve financial power, considering you used it to enable abuse to your sisters. You\u2019re not a very good brother to have, and you\u2019re just as abusive as your grandmother for allowing them to sit there and endure that when you had the power change such.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t even notice you\u2019re a whole 10+ years older than them\u2026 are you kidding me lol. Idk I think I\u2019m starting to understand why Julia disowned the fam.", "OP to answer your question\n\nYes, YTA for not taking the blame. \n\nYour grandmother was not a role model to your sisters. That's your imagination trying to make yourself feel better. \n\nPeople with Alzheimer's/Dementia generally die from it 7-10 years after onset. People don't usually realize there's a problem like Sundowning or get diagnosis until halfway through that. \n\nSo your grandmother probably had it THE ENTIRE TIME your sisters were with her. Abused them THE ENTIRE TIME. They were probably her care givers full time all through high school. That's not a role model. \n\nShe could have been if you took your sisters. \n\nYour 2 teenage sisters were working 80hr+ work weeks taking care of her. Plus going to school. \n\nMost grown emotionally stable people can't pull that off. Let alone ones with a lifetime of trauma that's added to daily. \n\nIt 100% was your fault she didn't get the life she wanted. You didn't intervene at all when they needed you. \n\nShe could've graduated with decent grades and gotten into her dream school as a foster kid if she focused on the goal. Once she was 18 her only responsibility would've been herself. \n\nYou did her no favors here.", "YTA if she was focused on her dream with no grandma to take care of, she might have a chance. But you took all that away from her and is now refusing to take any responsibility for it.", "Yta. And you are a failure. As a man. As a brother and as a human being. You forced your younger sisters to care for their abuser. You sit her and talk about how great your man was. But you didnt lift a finger to help her. Instead you used your power over your sisters to have them as free workers. \n\nYou have no right to tell your sisters anything. You abandoned them. \n\nBut dont worry. I doubt they will ever contact you again. And then you can sit with the memory of your abusive nan. While your sisters go nc with you. \n\nHoly f.. what an ass you are.", "YTA it\u2019s your fault because you had an opportunity to put your grandma into care but didn\u2019t. This would have allowed them to live like young people and maybe get through college because they weren\u2019t utterly exhausted from looking after someone with high needs.\n\nLet me guess, you opted for them to look after your grandma because a) it\u2019s women\u2019s work and b) it left more money in the inheritance for you.\n\nYou\u2019re a clear cut asshole", "Yes, you are a jerk and selfish.\n\nYES, YTA for not taking the blame for Katie not getting the chance to attend her dream school. It is both directly and indirectly your fault. \n\nEven though you say you \u201cget it\u201d, I really don\u2019t think you do.", "YTA - we are answering your question. It is completely your fault that they were not good students. You neglected them and your grandmother and they have suffered horribly for it. I can't believe they speak to you. Honestly, I am sorry for anyone who speaks to you.", "YTA. It actually IS your fault because you left two very young people in charge of the care of an elderly woman instead of purring her into a care home. MASSIVE a-hole.", "No wonder your sister was \"tipsy again.\" Dealing with your bullshit, if that were me, I would not be able to stand up, I'd be that plastered.... \n\n1000% asshole.", "YTA your grandmother required professional care and because you declined that you gave the responsibility of that complex care for your grandmother to your young sisters, this extremely reduced their resources to study and prioritise their education, you seem to evidence that \u2018Katie\u2019 flunked college and wasn\u2019t ready for college while she was balancing college and full time complex care for her grandmother but the fact that she is \u2018doing well\u2019 now that your grandmother has passed, no longer your sister\u2019s responsibility (which I remind you was your choice to give her), actually shows you that she could of \u2018done well\u2019 the first time if she wasn\u2019t caring for your grandmother and your being super dense to think otherwise, \nYes it is your fault and because of your choices you are responsible for the fact your sister didn\u2019t get into her \u2018dream college\u2019.", "I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re not my big brother. YTA.", "YTA. Because, and yes, I am focusing on \"the real question\", you required two teenage girls to become caregivers when you could have set them free to, you know, grow up like normal teenagers while grandma was cared for by people who chose caregiving as a profession. Therefore it is entirely your fault that they burned out, did badly at school, and otherwise didn't cope. \n\nWas it your fault she didn't go to her dream school? Who knows??? Sounds like it's very much your fault that she didn't have a free and clear shot at trying to go. \n\nIf anyone needs redirection, OP, it's you.", "YTA and an excellent reminder of why I have nothing to do with my older sibling. Selfish jerk barely even scratches the surface, everything here is ENTIRELY because of you and you completely ruined the lives of your siblings because you're a bad person. \n\nBut hey, at least you had zero family duties and plenty of space/money.", "Do all men disappear in your family?", "Honestly this is one of the worst stories I\u2019ve heard yet. YTA", "YTA your sister is going through mental crisis and you rubbish off her dreams. What if she could actually pass. You doubted her before you gave her the opportunity to atleast prove yourself right or let her prove you wrong. You denied her the opportunity.", "YTA!! and your edit is BS. we understand the question you asked and it's being answered. you just don't like the answer because you're trying to keep your head stuffed up your arse to not deal with reality. if you had okayed the seniors home when it was needed your siblings would not have had the added stress of being caregivers on their heads. the reason katie flunked was because she could not cope with school AND being the caregiver. notice how she started doing just fine once that stress was gone?? ya!! being a full time carer for a incapacitated(as it were) person is hard, which you'd know if you were there helping out. it takes a toll on you. most adult-adults can not do it and school at the same time. why on earth do you think a teenager could have??\n\nyou screwed your siblings over. you're old enough to be their dad but you left them to do all the hard work and figure it out on their own. now, you're being an ass because they understand life could have been different and are sad things aren't where they wan t it to be. get your head out of your ass. face it, you took the path that was the easiest, least involved you could be while still saying you weren't completely absent. you ignored them repeatedly when they needed you and left them up shit creek. YOU, not them. YOU!!", "YTA.  \nYou're failing to realize, with your update, that her not \"being ready\" and her having burn out is directly a result of you NOT doing what you should have done. You left the burden on them. You want people to tell you that you're nta because you don't want to feel guilty I guess, but not reading at all what people are saying to you. You ARE the a-hole here and owning up to it and admitting you made a mistake could actually help repair your relationship with your sister.", "YTA...In the end, you collected a large part of the inheritance, while you didn't lift a finger to take care of your demented grandmother. You didn't want the money to be wasted paying for a nursing home. It was a calculated move on your part and now you have the audacity to say something to your sisters.", "And one of them wasn\u2019t able to manage college while a young woman and also caring for her sick elderly grandmother - what a shocker? I wonder if OP has ever had to care for anyone at all, it sounds like he has no experience with that whatsoever, and thinks that being a \u201cfinancial caregiver\u201d from a distance is in any way comparable. \n\nAlso \u201cI said no\u201d? Why did you say no, OP? Why did you not listen to your sisters who were the ones having to deal with this? \n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right to resent you. I hope she gets to go on and live the life she wanted now she\u2019s no longer burdened with care work you would never have done despite being older and more responsible.", "What a fucking waste of human life", "And somehow he thinks this isn\u2019t \u201ethe real question\u201c. Wow. That is pretty damn horrible here.", "The grandma having dementia makes it so much worse.\n\nNot only was OP an asshole to his sisters, he was an asshole to his grandmother too. She needed professional care.", "This. Fuck you, OP. YTA.", "Exactly. Dementia doesnt start like a flu. Its very likely that the grandma was not ok long before her final years and those girls had to live their teenage years with a very complicated and ill person. No wonder they did not do well at school. Who would? they had very adult issues on their hands. Not to mention previous trauma.", "\"I don't care about grandma, I want you to explain why I was an AH to my sisters!\"", "Because obviously everyone ELSE is wrong and OP is the only one who REALLY knows it \"wasn't that bad\" for two children to sacrifice their health, youth and education to care full-time for a heavy, abusive, physically and mentally incompetent person. A job that trained professionals find stressful and never do 24/7.\nBut, obviously, an exhausted 17 y.o. shouldbe able to handle that AND a f/t cc course. \nVery much TA.", "Because, in true AH fashion, he cannot abide being called the AH.", ">OP doesn\u2019t seem to understand how stressful and exhausting it is\u2014mentally, physically, and emotionally\n\nOh I bet he does understand but he doesn't care. He had his slave kid sisters doing it whilst he gallivanted around doing what he wanted. And what's the bet he also was the one who benefited fully from grandma's will. No wonder the middle sister left. I bet he was the reason.", "They were teenagers, they were probably so scared with no clue what to do. They had no where to go.", "If only he could leave us all with Grandma", "I do wonder when Julia went NC. Nom got busted when the two youngest were young, but there's still a big difference in age. I could easily see the busting happening very soon after Julia went NC. Kinda curious how much or little Julia knows of the mess OP created.", "And you know the sisters were taking care of grandma throughout their teen years. Few people flip from \"I can do most things myself\" to \"I need full-time professional care\" overnight, there is usually a gradual shift or decline. They only asked for professional care once they were both adults. And I highly doubt the grandmother was in a position to provide the kind of care and support they needed as younger children as well.", "Everyone failed those kids, OP the most but how many teachers and friends saw signs of abuse and ignored them. They never stood a chance.", "Right? Like I'm betting that the only reason they're still around is because their inheritance is locked up in a trust under OP's management until they're 30 or something."]}
