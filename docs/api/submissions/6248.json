I'm the oldest out of my 4 siblings.\n\nMe (43m)\n\nJulia (40f)\n\nKenzie (27f)\n\nKatie (23f)\n\nJulia doesn't a play a part of this. She disowned the family and yeah...\n\nOur dad ran out on us and mom was busted for possession, among other crimes, when Katie and Kenzie were still very young, so they ended up in the custody of my grandma. If you ask them, they survived WW2, when it wasn't that bad. Our grandma was overly protective and tired having to take care of kids again. But nothing extreme. Her health rapidly declined in their early teen years. I was out of state so I wasn't a physical caregiver. I was power of attorney so I was a financial caregiver while they took care of the physical needs.\n\nKatie was going to drop out of high school. She barely graduated. This is important for the future.\n\nOnce she graduated her and Kenzie came to me. They said they wanted to put grandma in a home so Kenzie could take a manager position, and Katie wanted to get out of town, go to our state capital, take classes at a community college and transfer to their selective university. She said a teacher who knew her situation believed she had potential to get there and become something great.  They said it wasn't possible when caring for grandma.\n\nI told them no.\n\nThey've resented me since. Katie went to a community college in our town and flunked out right away. After grandma died, she went back and has been doing alright. She fell into a depression after her boyfriend cheated on her. She was talking about it to Kenzie and myself and said the thing that hurt was the person he cheated with was beautiful, talented, and then she said his affair partner actually goes to her dream school...she said this girl was everything she should had in life, well - rounded high school experience, parents to support her, a great education, and now this girl had truly taken everything from her. Then she mentioned she should have been at that school, but she was wiping the ass of something who called her every name in the book for 2 more years longer than she should have.\n\nThis isn't the first time she's been tipsy and made a passive aggressive comment, so I told her 'Katie, I'm not the reason you couldn't get into your dream school, you failed out right away from CC, and would have did the same thing there. you weren't ready and can't accept that'. Kenzie told me I was an ass who didn't understand burnout. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Guys, it seems I need to redirect you all - the question is not am I the ass for having them care for grandma, it's not taking blame for Katie chasing a crazy dream and going to her dream school!! I get it, I'm a jerk and selfish. Thanks.

I told my sister it wasn't my fault she went to her dream school. She barely finished high school and flunked out her first semester of CC. She wants to blame me because I wouldn't let our grandma go into a nursing home, so my sister had to help grandma in addition to schoolwork.\n2.

And they were forced to physically care for her, while you held all financial power over them. And have the gaul to say \"it wasn't that bad\".", "YTA.  Let me get this straight:  You had the financial and legal power to find a way to get professional care for your grandmother, who was at that time unable even to toilet by herself.  You chose, instead, to leave her in the hands of two untrained young adults.  They had an extra job on top of their other jobs and education, a job they were not trained to do, a job that the two of them had to divide between themselves, 24 hours a day, so there was never any relief from being around somebody who \"calls them every name in the book.\"\n\nAnd you have the nerve to blame them for being so stressed out and tired that Katie flunked out of college?\n\nNo wonder they resent you.  You asshole.\n\nETA: Just read some of your replies.  You left them to look after a heavy-bodied person WITH DEMENTIA.  You left her in the hands of a couple of barely-not-kids.  On the basis that before she developed dementia she would have recognized them.\n\nWhile you went off and did...whatever.\n\nHow, precisely, were you a \"protective grandson?\"", "After more information YTA, let's see. You forced teenagers barely out of highschool to take care of their dying grandma who may have very well been abusive. Not to mention she had dementia. So you also stopped her from getting professional care so you're an AH for that too. Because you didn't want her to feel abandoned. Even though you weren't there. Then you insulted your sister because she was bitter about the situation you forced on her.", "Question why did you say no to putting her in a home?", "YTA. \n\nInstead of doing the responsible thing and placing Grandma in proper care you left two teenagers responsible for Grandma. All while they were trying to graduate and be teenagers. At no time was it appropriate for this to happen. When Grandma's health starting declining when they were young teenagers someone needed to step in and assist them. They still needed raising! \n\nIt also sounds like grandma was abusive and you dismiss this as \"it wasn't that bad.\" \n\nAnd since you were in charge of the finances...how much did you pay them for caregiving services and how much did they get once grandma passed?", "Yta\n\nShe wasn't ready for school, but sure was ready to take care of an elderly woman?\n\nKarma will always come for people like you.", "YTA \n\nfor everything. \n\nThe girls could have made it. This is just so sad! Of course they were burnt out and tired from caring for grandma. I have seen dementia up close- it isn\u2019t pretty. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what they went through. They weren\u2019t health care professionals. A person with dementia who needs toileting help needs professional help. \n\nYour teenage sisters needed to be focusing on their studies instead of this. They definitely could have made it if they weren\u2019t experiencing burn out as they say. \n\nThey need therapy and more help moving forward. I hope they can go back to school and get back on track. They need someone in their corner and believing in them- you sure weren\u2019t and aren\u2019t.", "YTA- you are 20 years older than your sisters. They should not have been forced to play nursing home for their grandmother while you were off living your life and doing *whatever it is you do*. \n\nYou did, indeed, ruin their lives.

Of course you think that- you disappeared", "> 'Katie, I'm not the reason you couldn't get into your dream school, you failed out right away from CC, and would have did the same thing there. you weren't ready and can't accept that'.\n\nThis is complete rubbish. When she failed community college she was also one of the primary caregivers for a high needs dementia patient. She had no chance of doing well, all while you were out of state doing nothing to help. It is entirely your fault that she had no chance of getting in to her dream school. YTA\n\nWhat was your reasoning for refusing to put her in a home?", "YTA. You ARE the reason your sister didn\u2019t get to go to her dream school. You refused to help your sick grandmother and forced your much younger sister to take on the role of caregiver\u2014a role that you wouldn\u2019t take on yourself.  Do you know how hard it is to take care of a sick adult who cannot take care of themselves?  Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019m 36 and am my dad\u2019s caregiver. I cannot imagine an 18 year old having to do what I do while also attending school. It\u2019s no wonder she flunked out!\n\nAlso, stop minimizing what your sisters went through when your mother went to jail. From what it sounds like, your grandmother did not want to raise either of your sisters, but took on that role because she didn\u2019t have a choice. Obviously, you weren\u2019t going to take care of them. Your sisters had to know their grandmother didn\u2019t want them. They also had to know you didn\u2019t either. Shame on you.", "YTA. I'm paid to wipe the asses of angry older pts and I can tell you that it's not the job for two teens who were abandoned up to that point.

YOU helped to derail your sister\u2019s life. \n\nYou expected and forced your sisters to do the care you yourself were not willing to do. And now you are not to blame?? Of course you are.\n\nAnd you have the audacity to mouth back to them about it not being your fault? Gtfo", "So much YTA in this post I don\u2019t even know where to begin\n\nYou claim it wasn\u2019t that bad for them even though you didn't live with your grandmother and weren't even near enough to visit on a regular basis. For all you know she could have been abusive towards them.\n\nYou refused to put your grandmother in a place she could get proper care because 'she family' yet you wouldn't lift a finger to help. Throwing money at a problem isn't the same as living with it day in and day out. \n\nYou forced you teenage sisters to stay in an environment they obviously weren't qualified to deal with when you had other options, even after they asked you.\n\nKatie did badly in high-school and college while taking care of her grandmother, but is doing perfectly fine now that she's gone and you seriously don't get why she blames you for her false start? \n\nI don't even know what to do with that level of selfishness. I'm  thinking the sister that disowned the family had the right idea.", "Yta, why didn\u2019t you move back and physically take care of your grandma?", "YTA. You are abusive. You used your money to force two teenage girls to care for your abusive grandmother; you forced them to sacrifice their futures because you were too stingy and lazy to do the work yourself. Shame on you. No wonder your other sister cut you off.", "YTA for this 1 reason. They did not want to be caregivers and you forced them to stay in that position. \nSome of your sisters anger is misplaced but you also did them wrong and took time away from their life.", "YTA\nAnd cruel", "YTA. You seem to have a thing where you minimize the trauma of others. You had grand parents that survived the war but the war \u201cwasn\u2019t that bad\u201d?? Having also had grandparents that survived the war who \u201chad it easy\u201d they still witnessed and experienced a lot of things that were vile examples of humanity. Those things stuck with them until the day they died. \n\nYou forced your teenage siblings to care for an elderly woman with dementia when you could have given your grandmother the proper care she needed and your sisters the life they deserved to have. What they did with that life was up to them, not you. \n\nTo answer your edit, yes you are the AH for preventing Katie from chasing her dream which was not unreasonable in the least.", ">the question is not am I the ass for having them care for grandma, it's not taking blame for Katie chasing a crazy dream and going to her dream school\n\nIt is the same question because by denying them the care their grandmother needed you held them back.\n\nYou are absolutely to blame.

I hope Kenzie and Katie disown you.\n\nYou are the absolute worst kind of family member to have. Abusive.  YTA.", "YTA for not taking responsibility. Maybe she failed out of community college is because she was taking care of a dying woman while taking classes. Where were you while these young ladies were taking care of your grandmother?", "YTA, go volunteer with dementia patients and then apologize to your sisters. It doesn't seem like you were ever around dying dementia patient, because then you'd understand it's impossible to take care of them and do well in school.", "Even if your sisters had landed with a truly remarkable caregiver and had every possible support, losing both parents at a young age would be likely to have some lasting effects. Similarly, caring for someone with dementia is deeply traumatic even if that person is not unkind. The idea that your sister's struggles with school (which, by the way, are common and not a moral failing) are unrelated to this is complete BS. YTA, take responsibility for your cruelty.", "YTA for forcing your sisters to care for your grandma and basically give up their lives and what they wanted. That\u2019s selfish. A home would have been better suited for everyone in that scenario.", "YTA. Yes, I have read your original question. YTA for telling your sister it\u2019s not your fault when in fact you played a significant role in the direction her life took by not helping when she asked for it. Caring for an elderly person with dementia is incredibly demanding (physically and emotionally). That\u2019s why people hire professionals to do it. No wonder she flunked out, poor kid. On top of that, you belittled her aspirations and accepted no responsibility despite your own admission that it was your choice not to put Grandma in a home. I reiterate: YTA. It is your fault.", "Since you want so bad someone to answer your question, yes YTA for telling your sister that beacause IT IS absolutely your fault. Poor sisters.", "Yta. Because you're wrong. She failed out of CC because full-time caring and school was too much to handle. Which is why she wanted to leave in the first place!! You forced them to care for grandma instead of paying for it like the \"finacial caregiver.\" Funfact: using teenagers as slaves is not finacial care giving. Its abuse. YTA for the rest of the post too, but this was just answering the specific posted question.", "YTA you actually have no idea how Katie would have done at her dream school instead of stuck taking care of grandma, attending a school she didn\u2019t want to and likely angry and/or depressed about the whole situation.", "Also, let\u2019s say the girls were 4 and 6 when placed with grandma. You would have been around 24 at that time. Definitely old enough to step in and raise your two siblings instead of leaving them with an old woman who was tired of raising children. It sounds like you\u2019ve been too selfish to help these girls when they needed someone to look out for them and love them. Shame on you.", "YTA your edit is irrelevant because it's a factor that plays a part in why you're the asshole for saying it. Stop deflecting. Your sister could have done well in the other state if she wasn't stuck home wiping yours grandmas wrinkly ass.", "Omgggg.  YTA from the original post.  A bigger AH with the edit. And your comments make you one the biggest assholes ever.  There are really no word for how big an AH you are now and then. You don\u2019t leave high school kids to care for elderly who can\u2019t physically care for themselves.

AH x a million.", "YTA.  What you seem to not be understanding is that the very reason your sister had trouble at community college is BECAUSE she was caring for the grandmother.

Very rarely am I so disgusted by a post.\n\nCongratulations.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cIf you ask them, they survived WW2.\u201d Probably because they had their family torn apart in a very traumatic way and had their older brother disregard them right along with it.

You took away an old woman's dignity, who you claim to have cared for, and you did it at the expense of your sisters while you and solely you benefited from exploiting them.

She wanted to go to a specific school, she was motivated and happy, and you took it away from her. She failed CC because, thanks to your actions, she was not where she wanted to be, her head was not in the right place and she had no motivation to study. She was depressed. And that is all on you.

You weren't there to be the daily caregiver, you basically forced them to deal with it. Being a daily caregiver can be EXHAUSTING and thankless, especially if the person is combative (whether due to personality or disease). By forcing Katie (and Kenzie I presume) into this role, she had to delay her own life. By the time she started that life, she was mentally (and physically) drained - not the best way to start, so she was STARTING well behind the starting line and had to try to catch up. Without support - she burned out quick probably trying to get her life on the track she foresaw in the shortest amount of time possible and she couldn't do it. Is she blameless? No, but neither are you. What right did you have to force them to take care of grandma while not lifting a finger yourself? did you at least try to get a professional caretaker in for her to give them a break? did you ever show up yourself so they could take a break?", "You are a horrible sister.

Since you updated your post to specify that you want the ruling to be solely based on you not taking the blame for Katie not going to her dream school, let me spell it out for you:\n\nTaking care of someone with dementia is a BIG job. It is also emotionally draining. \n\nYour sisters were tasked with this job without their input or consent. And despite this, still tried to pursue other things, ex: Katie going to community college.\n\nYou seem to think the fact that she flunked out of community college her first try at it is proof positive that it was a foolish dream for her to have wanted to put your grandmother in a nursing home so she could focus on her studies and transfer to her dream school.\n\nWhat you\u2019re failing to recognize is that YOU set Katie up to fail. The chances of her scraping through community college under the circumstances that she was in, are AT BEST, extremely slim.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t been so selfish and self justified in offloading your grandmother onto your sisters, then Katie\u2019s educational plan very potentially could have been successful.\n\nYou are absolutely the asshole for failing to take ownership of what you did to your sisters, recognize the impact it had on their lives and apologize for it", "YTA.

Of course she wasn't doing well in school, you sabotaged that! Grown ass adults have a hard time juggling jobs and elder care, how is a teen/young woman supposed to magically do it better?!\n\nAlso to your comment regarding inheritance: there is no amount that can replace her missed opportunities.

It's depressing and left me with long lasting emotional scars, so I can only imagine how much worse your poor sisters had it. What a complete dick. As an older brother, I hope you're ready for your sisters to not only resent you, but go no or low contact. Especially considering you show 0 remorse for what you put them through. Are you proud of yourself? Does your spouse know what an uncaring person you are?\n\nOn behalf of your sisters, OP, fuck you.", "But YOU didn't take care of her! You forced them to do it.  MASSIVE YTA", "Deserves care from ~us~ but definitely not me specifically that would be too hard lol fuck off", "Did you PAY them for caregiving services? Or did you just force them into roles they should have never had because you didn't want to deal with yourself?", "Sounds like they should have received *ALL* the inheritance. \n\nWhat did you get? Julia?", "I just watched a coworker deal with a mother with dementia and it was extremely hard for her as a woman in her 50s, let alone for two teens! Yta and a big one.", "You exploited your young and vulnerable sisters for free labour, effectively robbing them of a large and very important time in their life. You are truly a shitty person.", "That\u2019s why you wouldn\u2019t do it, you didn\u2019t want to pay but didn\u2019t care enough to help", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. You were all in an impossible situation. Nursing homes are expensive, you can\u2019t take care of everyone. Could you have done more? Yes, does that mean you are responsible for everyone else\u2019s lives and choices? No. They can just as easily blame Julia for the situation", "You don\u2019t get to say this wasn\u2019t abuse. You were not there and you were not the one taking care of her. Of course it looks ok from your point of view, far away from everyone. YTA and you better hope they don\u2019t figure out how little you care about them. They will leave you alone. I hope they do.", "It is difficult for adults who have plenty of life experience to care for people with dementia. You left the responsibility to two young kids. How can you not realize that juggling this responsibility would negatively impact the start of their adult life? \n\nYou are cold and uncaring. YTA.", "I was married at the time and out of state. I couldn't uproot my life. I helped them financially so it's not like I didn't do anything.", "It was dementia. There were mobility problems due to her weight.", "I want to see him beg his sisters for help and be cruelly made to be a fool. He\u2019s not sorry at all.", "OP was financially secure and in their 30s. If they liked Gramma so much, they could have moved her in with them to care for. But they value themselves over their sisters. YTA op", "Are you really saying it was right of OP to force her teenage siblings to care for a woman with dementia who couldn't even use the toilet on her own?", "In all of the 16 countries my family lives in there is financial assistance for the elderly needing care. Here in the USA is Medicaid. Granted if OP wanted to keep controlling interest of grandma's home she can't go that way but no where does op even look at options", "Nope - he was an adult, his sisters were kids, he left them to shoulder the burden.", "Thank you.", "Right? And even if OP visited I'm sure his sisters did their damnedest to make sure grandma was on her best behavior around him because he was the one controlling the purse strings and they didn't want things to be worse because OP got too offended by grandma's \"outspokenness\".", "You couldn't uproot your life, yet you expected them to put off starting a life at all, whilst using them as cheap care for your grandmother? If it was your decision not to put her into residential care, then you should have taken on the burden of caring for her. YTA", "Couldn't uproot your life but expected your sisters to put theirs on pause indefinitely?", "How would you feel if someone forced your teenage children to be long-term caregivers for your aging parents? Run that idea by your wife and see how she reacts.", "If it mattered that much to you you could have moved the grandmother to your home or near your home and care for her there. Instead you asked significantly younger sibs to give up their lives making them resentful and indebted. YTA", "So instead of you, a full adult who could make all sorts of legal decisions, taking care of this situation, you dumped the care of an elderly dementia patient onto a couple teens who then had zero chance of even creating a life for themselves.\n\nThere isn't a curse in Entish, Elvish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for you.", "\u201cI couldn\u2019t uproot my life\u201d so I made my teenage sisters uproot their life at a critical time to take care of someone they were not equipped to take care of. May this karma came swift and strong to you. AH is really not strong enough for you.", "Too bad. You were the oldest and the one with power of attorney. You should have rearranged your life to take care of her before forcing your sisters to instead.", "I see why you are no longer married.", "So you forced your young sisters to do something you wouldn't do yourself. Wowwwww", "And you didn\u2019t think about moving her to your home if you cared about her welfare that much?", "Did you hire nurses to come in and take care of her?", "Lol so your life and time is more valuable than your sisters. We got you. God you\u2019re a crap human. They sacrificed years while you did the bare ass minimum. Shame on you. \n\nYTA. For everything you describe and did.", "All you had to do was drive down to pick up Grandma to move her in with you and your wife. \n\nWow!", "You are so incredibly selfish.", "Wow. SO you not only reaped the rewards by having your grandma in her best years, but you also put your sisters in the last awful years of your grandma's life when she had dementia and abusing your little sisters on a daily basis since they were teenagers. \n\nI have never seen a more villain-like person here on this sub.\n\n100/10 YTA. I hope karma gets to you.", "WOW, the absolute NERVE. \n\nAnd to answer your \u201credirected\u201d question (thanks for being condescending to everyone, nice getting a further glimpse into the depth of your self-absorption), yes YTA for telling Katie it wasn\u2019t your fault because - newsflash! - it totally was!! \n\nYou left those girls in an environment that was untenable to success while you were out of state with your own family making executive decisions for everyone.", "Wow what a shitty grandchild you were", "No, you did something worse than nothing. You stopped them from being able to live their lives while you were having the time of your life. If you were such a great grandson, you shouldn't have left them at all. YTA, karma will get you sooner or later.", "You didn\u2019t want the abuse", "You didn\u2019t uproot your life so you basically ruined theirs. YOU were the adult and you forced 2 kids with literally nowhere to go to care for a dying women with dementia. BuT I HelPeD oUt FiNaNcIaLlY\u2026\n\nHow? Did they receive massive pay as a caregiver? Or did you just make sure the minimums were met like property tax, utilities and all the BARE MINIMUMS PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR KIDS?\n\nMust be rough living states away and having your siblings complain about their difficulties and you just being SOOOOO annoyed because it\u2019s not that bad..\n\nI remember when I was told my marriage \u201ccouldn\u2019t be that bad cuz married people fight\u201d.\n\n\nThen they\u2019d find out my ex wife would physically punch me (and she was not a weak or petite woman) and pulled a gun on me, would steal from my parents to support her drug habit and would harass me at work to the point of nearly being fired\u2026\n\nCuz you know \u201cshe was just blunt and strong willed\u201d to everyone who didn\u2019t have to live and interact with her everyday.\n\nI can\u2019t wait for the true off my chest post in a few years when you\u2019re all alone and nobody wants anything to do with such a selfish narcissist", "You were selfish and cowardly and stole labour from young girls rather than do any work yourself. If it was important to you YOU should have done it.", "With that said.\n\n\n\nYTA.\n1000%. Sorry I have had friends who are caretakers for relatives that have dementia. The stuff that I over hear just breaks my heart because I know the person doesn't mean it, but to hear day in and day out that you are a who+e or an idiot etc does DOES  cause physiological issues for the caregiver.\n\n(Bless all those caregivers at home and at nursing homes).\n\nIt sounds like you were not really listening to your siblings about how bad it was getting and tbh (no offense to your siblings) they are NOT trained to handle that...esp. the worse it got. For all you know, she could have survived longer with PROPER attention. \n\nAnd your sister is totally right here. You are basing your opinion about how she would have handled school AFTER caring for your grandma etc etc and dealing with depression. \n\nDid you ever think what might have been best is to get your grandmother the proper care she needed while reliving some of the burden off your siblings? As you said, you dealt with the financial stuff (which I KNOW is stressful.. but not nearly as much as the day to day care of your grandma)\n\nIf she was being cared for by properly trained staff your sisters could have visited her every week etc while still continuing to improve their lives. Your sister could have been a Rockstar (hell her plan was pretty solid to begin with).", "You subjected young girls to dementia?! Double YTA\u2026", "Why are you so freaking obtuse. Your money doesn\u2019t save you from fault. You had the power and ability to do what\u2019s right. Your grandmother could\u2019ve been in a nice facility getting the proper care she needs but you left your sisters with no choice but to put a hold on their own lives to take care of a dementia patient. If you knew how stressful and emotionally challenging it is to care for someone with dementia. You\u2019d be less of an AH. Of course your sister couldn\u2019t do well in school if she was a full time caregiver.", "Also... I want to point out that by NOT getting your grandma proper medical care, that is elder abuse. \n\nMy family was forced to make a similar decision on the fly. Proper medical care trumps whatever feelings you have about her being taking care of by strangers. The way you spun this was that your sisters would wash their hands of her if you put her in a nursing home. You don't know that. (And if they did.. who could blame them with all the abuse they took that you didn't have too).", "They were not trained medical professionals. You neglected three people because you couldn\u2019t have been bothered.", "As someone who watched their grandmother deteriorate to dementia, you - someone who wasn\u2019t there or a caretaker - have no idea what that\u2019s like. You\u2019re heartless and cruel to have treated your sisters this way.", "Everyone in that family has trauma. The sisters lived with grandma while op wasn\u2019t even around for years. Why does op have more responsibility than everyone else? Everyone on Reddit acts like they\u2019d ruin their lives for other people but I don\u2019t believe it for a second. It\u2019s a bad situation. If the sisters wanted out they could let grandma go into the system since they hated her so much", "Ya I work with older adults and part of my job involves preparing spouses to be caregivers to their sick partners. I have seen 70 year olds who have raised families, have money and support systems, and have plenty of degrees and life experience just collapse at the burden. I can\u2019t imagine doing it when I was 16.", "Who forced them? Op just said they wouldn\u2019t put her in a home. The sisters were adults now, they can make decisions, op isn\u2019t the only one in this story with autonomy. They\u2019re lucky op didn\u2019t disappear like Julia and helped pay for stuff", "Has it not occurred to you that they did poorly in school because they had what amounted to a full time job on top of school? More than full time, really. And yes, that is a direct result of you relying on two teenagers instead of putting your grandmother in the care of professionals. \n\nTo answer your edit: yes, YTA. You are to blame and for a lot more than Katie missing out on her dream school. You\u2019re to blame for them missing their entire teenage experience. You get to share that blame with your parents, but you were definitely a key part. My guess? They\u2019ll go no contact with you like your other sister and no one but you will blame them for it.", "Medicaid would have paid, you unrepentant doorknob.", "YTA you didn't even look into the resources available and just assumed you were saving yourself the money? \n\nI hope you have built a solid family at home and friend group or else aging is going to be lonely", "You should be dedicating your money to your sisters as compensation.", "If they put grandma in a home, there would be less money left for inheritance once she died.  Nursing homes cost upwards of 5k a month (in the US) Whatever money grandma had, it would quickly be eaten up in nursing home costs. \n\nOop ruined her sisters lives for a bigger inheritance.", "Op may fully expect his own teens to do this for himself.\n\nI hope he gets a nice harsh lesson when that happens", "I wonder if the sisters would have a case against the estate?  At least criminal charges for neglect, child abandonment, knowingly endangering minors.", "Because minors should be receiving care, not providing it. And by law minors can\u2019t make legal decisions for grandma only OP who has power of attorney can.", "They didn\u2019t really have much of a choice though really. They started caring for her as teens, alone bc op lived out of state building his own family. They were for all intents and purposes alone while he managed the estate. He decided they were going to be carers when he refused to use his power of attorney to find grandma a nice home, not them. I really doubt 2 teenagers would agree to take on a job that breaks adults \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f realistically they probably realised they couldn\u2019t afford to move out even together, and didn\u2019t want to be kicked out when they refused to be cheap labour", "What decision do you expect them to make when they\u2019re barely out of school and bearing the burden of caring for a dementia patient?\n\nDo you expect them to pay for a caregiver? Because I\u2019m pretty sure there is no job you can get with no degree or training that is enough to cover around the clock nursing.\n\nMaybe they should have just walked out and left her to die?", "Yup- the edit really did it for me. Like he needs to redirect us to his actual question and can\u2019t see how the two are directly correlated.", "I so want to see him post saying his kids abandoned him.", "Ok so someone should\u2019ve called social services when they were minors but Op said when the discussion of nursing homes was happening the sisters already had gone to college and had a job so they weren\u2019t minors anymore. They had nothing forcing them to stay there, they could call social services for grandma who they hated so why do they care? Grandma would either get sent to op or a home anyway in that scenario", "They hated her so what do they care if the state takes over? Or op because the state would go to them first. Idk why redditors act like 20 year olds are babies sometimes and adults other times. A 20 year old who can figure out everything that goes into getting into college can research their options or talk to a guidance counselor", "Well I am glad you would have known what to do as a teenager who had just graduated high school and a 21 year old. Good for you I bet you are pleased with yourself.", "My grandmother died in April. For the past 10 or so years, I got to see my fully grown adult mother and her 3 adult siblings struggle to manage everything related to her finances and care. Hours of phone calls with Medicare, senior living facilities, at home nursing companies, doctors, pharmacies, etc.\n\nFour adults in their 50s-70s, all college educated, mostly retired or semi-retired. People with access to money, information, and free time.\n\nApplying to college was a whole hell of a lot easier than that.\n\nI don\u2019t care how old the sisters were. They already had full time jobs as home nurses for grandma, plus whatever school/jobs they had outside of the home, plus everything that goes into running a household. That is already an enormous amount of work for anyone, adult or not. To expect them to sort out the nightmare that is the senior care system on top of that is fucking ridiculous.\n\nAnd yeah, they probably could have just abandoned her to the state. Sure that would have gone over really well with OP who was sitting hours away holding the purse strings.", "Op says the decline started early teens, so at worst 13 for Katie and like 17 for Kenzie. So it\u2019s less like \u201ctreating them like babies\u201d and more like they were pretty much babies when it started and didn\u2019t know any different. And she did go to a teacher, it comes up in her argument about how the teacher saw her potential and op shot that down too. They didn\u2019t really have any options other than toe the line or go to a homeless shelter, hate or not they would have just had to suck it up", "I am thanks. Glad you are too. I live in the real world where not everything is black and white and I don\u2019t dismiss peoples trauma based on their age. Hope you\u2019re pleased too since you do that"]}
