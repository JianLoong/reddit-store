She had to lose her sister and then she lost her mother too. Thank God she had you and your mom to show her that she was a priority!\n\n\nIt's so very very sad that Emily sister is no longer with us but uhm. News flash Jeanette- Emily is still here!!!! I think allowing a memorial table at your wedding was a super kind thing to do. Having an empty seat wouldn't work for me personally. Everyone is different and I'm sure that's great for some people but I totally get saying no.\n\nGood for both of you for putting yourselves first and eloping. You getting married is about you. It's not about Emily's sister. \n\nEmily's mother needs serious serious serious therapy and help. Keep the boundaries until she does so. Are you going to have a child and be told it must be named after Reagan? When will it end? Who knows but you don't need to participate. Best of luck to both of you!", "100% NTA \n\nEveryone grieves differently, but there are lines and Jeanette has crossed them. When you start neglecting another child in favor of the dead, taking over unrelated events with them, and otherwise making them the center of your life, especially over your living child, you're not healing, you're just tearing the wound open more and more\n\nYour wedding isn't a day you get back. If you can't trust someone not to make a scene, then they shouldn't be there. Even if they're family, and especially not if they're family who have hurt you in the past. Even if she did absolutely nothing on the day (which you can't garuntee) you would both still be WORRIED about it the entire time, and no one deserves that at their wedding reception. \n\nIf I may address Emily directly? I know it hurts when a parent can't find it in themself to act like they should. It can cause a lot of strife and internal issues. But it is not, and never has been your fault. You deserve to be happy, you deserve to get to live your life, and I wish you every happiness. If you mom is too stuck in the past to move on, then it may be worth considering limiting your contact with her. That wouldn't be you being unreasonable, that would be you taking steps to protect yourself from someone who apparently cannot help but hurt you. No one deserves to be haunted by a ghost, and it's not for you to carry her grief for her. Not now, and certainly not when you were a child.\n\nI wish you both a great deal of happiness in your marriage! And good on both of you for both being willing to compromise and then deciding to elope instead of caving! Be there for each other, and don't let anyone gaslight you into putting anyone else before each other (except for any eventual children, obviously XD)", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry when anyone loses a family member, especially a child. But to make EVERYTHING about that deceased child is a huge slap in the face to their other child(ren). Your wife\u2019s mother has shown herself to make events about her deceased daughter (the fake diploma) and if you can\u2019t trust her to celebrate you and your wife, you\u2019re right to take the stance you have. I\u2019m sorry. Your wife deserves better from her parents.", "NTA. Jeannette has weaponized her grief \u2026 so she can always be the center of attention and get her way.\n\nNothing you can do about that except keep her at arm\u2019s length. And who cares what she says?", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry you are being out in this position.  You are literally trying to protect your wife when her conditioned response to her mother is to fold like a dollar tree lawn chair . \n\nSince you say she is on this post as well I will say direct to her .  Emily, this man wants better for you then you dare to want for yourself . THIS is what love and consideration should look like.  Your mother is choosing to allow her loss to color all the rest of her life and you can\u2019t fix that. What you can do is allow your guide through this situation to be your husband since he can see things without the baggage of your relationship to your mother .  This isn\u2019t about him making the decision this is about him protecting you when you cannot protect yourself.  \n\nI do not for one second believe that your mother is going to be capable of behaving at your reception. She literally already cost you the wedding and will very likely spoil your reception and your marriage if given space to do so. \n\nBoundaries especially in the circumstances that involve alcohol  are  gonna be very important and lucky for you it sounds like you have a man to help you with that .", "NTA \n\nJeannette\u2019s way of grieving is more like idolatry of Reagan and it\u2019s unhealthy that warranted a professional since yesterday. You all have my sympathy especially since Emily\u2019s parents neglected their only living child. Your in-laws extremism is what got them disinvited.", "Oh Lord no, NTA.  Jeanette needs some serious head shrinkers!  Why aren't you NC with that bonkers of a woman?", "NTA. She would find a way to make it all about Reagan.\n\nBlock her on all electronics until after the reception and make sure on the day that you have someone to act as security to keep her out, just in case.\n\nAnd congrats on the marriage!

The financial threat showed her true colors and she can't be trusted.", "NTA - Jeannette is out of line and seems to be attention seeking.", "Congratulations to the bride and groom! \n\nYou are NTA, and my heart goes out to Emily for her mother's intransigence. Please consider setting passwords on any  vendors for the reception and hiring security for the door. While that may sound extreme, your MIL's actions have been and continue to be extreme.", "NTA. Jeanette needs a reality check or she is going to negate everything for Emily for the rest of her life. \n\nTell Jeanette that she needs counseling that will also need to include Emily so that Emily can explain how far her mom has gone.\n\nMeanwhile, tell Jeanette that she needs to take this time to reflect on how she has shut down Emily for Reagan.

Making a fake diploma for a kid who would have been in middle school is so far beyond grief. I'm glad Emily has you to stand up for her and your family to support and care about her. \n\nMake sure you hire security for the reception. You'll need it. Give them all her picture and explicit instructions on what to do if she shows up. \n\nI do wonder if the dad should get a separate invitation. You don't mention him much, so I'm assuming he isn't the problem but sits back and allows his wife to run amok over everything. If he's decent and willing to attend without his wife, it might be nice for Emily to have one parent there and for him not to miss his only surviving daughter's wedding.

You MIL suffered a horrible loss but with that said how she chooses to deal or rather not deal with her grief is having a horrible impact on her living child.    You and Emily have do what is best for her mental health and your mental health too. Nothing about this is healthy.  She will ruin every milestone moment in your wife\u2019s life.

They don\u2019t know of a healthy way to acknowledge and remember their deceased child. The mom needs serious grief therapy as this will not get better if you have kids.

That said, he does nothing to try to back up Emily which pisses me off almost more than Jeanette's behavior. What kind of man doesn't stand up for his daughter?", "NTA\n\nJeanette needs therapy.  .    \nShe also needs to know that the length of grief you have is NOT proportional to the love you have for that person.

I can\u2019t imagine the pain of losing a child, most people can\u2019t and most people don\u2019t have the tools necessary to navigate it either, she needs help badly, she won\u2019t be able to do it on her own without professional help.", "NTA. \n\nI feel for Jeanette, who so desperately needs help.\n\nUntil she gets it, though, you are NTA.", "NTA.

Both of your continued association with Jeanette should be conditional on therapy for her grief. Between the alcohol binge, the guilt tripping, the harassment, etc. The picture painted is of someone who you would literally be enabling unless you encourage her strongly to seek help. Grief, particularly parental grief over a child, is almost impossible to understand. Which is why a professional who can help her actually work through that grief is 100% necessary. If she has already, she needs more, and maybe a new therapist.", "NTA\n\nEmily, your mother has some serious mental health issues.  There's a lot of narcissistic traits and she could be a narcissist and this is how it's coming out.  She's making this all about her.  Her grief, her loss.. but using Reagan as the conduit.  And it's to the detriment of her other child - you.\n\nWhat she's doing is far beyond grief and sounds like pathologic.  Has she ever had any therapy for her grief?  She may refuse... or she may have gone but stopped quickly when she wasn't hearing what she wanted to.  She wants validation for her grief over and over and over again.  She may have looked like the perfect mother but I suspect that there were toxic traits in your childhood but you didn't recognise them because they were your normal.\n\nWhat she doesn't realise is that she's losing/lost her relationship with you.  You actually don't owe her anything... at all... and not even that relationship with her.  Grieve the loss of your mother.. and it sounds like you are with your comment about how the mother you knew was buried with Reagan.\n\nBoundaries are important with her.  Your dad is enabling your mother in her treatment of you.  He may need his own therapist.  Or this is a deep seated enablement that's always been there because it's easier for him.  Rather than fight your mother over everything or have to deal with her tantrums and distress when someone holds a boundary... it's easier for him to let it go.  It may cost him a relationship with you and your future children.\n\nYou and your husband may be the first people that have ever held a boundary with your mother which is why you are getting the behaviour you are seeing.  Continue to hold those boundaries.  Your husband was right in telling your mother what he did.  He's informed her well before the event and she has a choice.  It's not like she's turned up to your reception and then expected you to do these things and you not wanting a scene, letting her get away with it.  I'd even look at having people at the door looking out for her in case she does want to create a scene.", "hey so my sister died Oct 21\n\nI got married last November. \n\nmy sister and I were extremely close, so I had a seat for her as my MOH, and some more tributes.\n\nstill, a couple times my mum accidentally tried to go a bit too far with some things. but when I gently spoke to her about it she immediately course-corrected and apologised. \n\nkeep in mind this is a woman who only lost her daughter 13 months earlier. a daughter who was her best friend. in fact, mum still describes my sis as her platonic soul-mate (as in, someone she knows she will always be closely connected to in every life).\n\nShe still understood the day was about me & my husband and her speech was a beautiful tribute to us, with (i think) one mention that my sister is here with us etc. \n\nIf my mum can behave like a functioning adult only 13 months after the worst time of her life, your MIL can pull her head out of her ass and give some love to her living daughter before it's too late."]}
