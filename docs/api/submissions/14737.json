Girlfriends may come and go but school friendships are special, one of a kind and I'm hoping you can stick to your guns on this one.

It is a shame its the same weekend as her family meet-up but like you said there will be others. Tread carefully with her because if she is this upset about you going out with friends, what does the future hold? There will be times in life that the 2 of you cant be together or do the same things together.", "NTA.  It's not like this is a last minute cancellation.

But you\u2019re also in the right to choose to meet up with friends you haven\u2019t seen in years (if this is really the ONLY time you can see them). This is clearly a difference in priorities, but I think most people would understand that unexpected things come up. \n\nIt would probably be in your best interest to apologize to her family directly for missing. 4 times a year really isn\u2019t much, and your girlfriend might\u2019ve really been looking forward to going to that dinner.

Totally get going to see the friends! Have fun! But also her feeling hurt is valid. You did say you would do the thing, now she has to go alone.

Why does he have to feel bad about cancelling on that when it happens in May and its only mid April? Its not even a last minute cancellation, he's giving plenty of heads up.\n\nThese are the kinds of things that happen in relationships when one partner slowly isolates the other from their friends. Happens all the time, and now here the poor guy has to feel bad about meeting up with friends he hasn't met in 2 years.

They didn't stop talking, **they stopped meeting** because each got their life going on and are usually geographically far from each other.\n\nHe is also not looking for the same type of attention his gf provides, it's not a competition and if his gf is trying to turn this into one, he should have a serious talk with her about it.\n\nLast, but not least, there will be another meeting further down the road he can go, he's been going to all of their last meetings anyways.", "Me, either.

I must've missed it!!", "Family's can ask questions with good intentions, give advice with good intentions, and still have it end in a negative emotional response from the person being questioned. This is an emotions issue, and they don't run on logic.", "Okay I apologize for assuming they stopped texting you that was my fault. But with this new info that you mentioned I think you\u2019re still TA. Reason now is that you said they didn\u2019t stop texting you or communicating with you. Why didn\u2019t you go guys plan on a day where it didn\u2019t interfere with any plans anyone had. You still mentioned that you already agreed with her plans.

That\u2019s where I think you\u2019re still the AH", "I\u2019m sorry but my answer hasn\u2019t changed due to the canceling of the plans. I get there are other meetings that\u2019s fine but if you agree and cancel people are going to get upset about it. That\u2019s the norm. You have to imagine that happening to you. If someone cancels there plans after agreeing to go hang out with there friends because of a last minute call then yeah I\u2019d be upset and anybody in a relationship would be upset. It\u2019s not like he said he got into a car accident or his mom is in the hospital. Those are reasonable but he said to go hang out with his friends in which he could\u2019ve planned this accordingly with everyone some other time that you guys could.", "I\u2019m not trying to be disrespectful to anyone but In my opinion I think it\u2019s disrespectful to cancel plans because you made some plans right after agreeing to the original plans", "Because they're in the area for different things. 2 of them are going to be nearby for work and a couple of others said they'll come to make it a reunion so we didn't choose this date, it's just came up because of some friends work plans.", "You keep deliberately ignoring the fact we live nowhere near each other and are only nearby in May because of a coincidence so no it is not as simple as just planning a different day.", "I understand you're not trying to be disrespectful, but this logic is very flawed. You even said yourself that depending on the reason you would be ok with, so then it becomes a question of \"is my reason good enough\".\n\nOP thinks it's a good enough reason, he may never be able to meet these people again as things progress in their respective lives (they marry/have kids/move away from the country, etc.), all over 1 more family gathering.", "Right I understand choosing the date was out of control. Have you guys tried to meet up before to see where your schedule lies?", "It is that simple because you guys can refer to each other\u2019s schedules any day of the week and come up with a day where you guys can meet. Yes you guys live in different locations awesome. But at the same time you guys could\u2019ve talked it over to see who had any plans which day or a specific day and moved the days to another one. Or each person could try and take a vacation day to go meet up. For me it\u2019s all about planning. You guys could\u2019ve worked around whatever situation you guys are in any other time throughout the 2 years apart", "I see your reasoning I agree with that but at the same time what I\u2019m saying is they kept in contact even after college right? That\u2019s known fact. They could\u2019ve made plans in that year or the next to try and meet up. That\u2019s what I\u2019m also getting at too. Again if I said anything disrespectful I didn\u2019t mean too and I\u2019m very sorry for it", "This is the only day we're all in the area. Meeting up earlier isn't an option when we're all in different cities", "Yes and travelling to the different side of the country is a lot different from being in the same or nearby city. Did you ignore the part where I said 2 of the friends were nearby due to work? Are they supposed to ask their boss to move their schedule because I have plans with my gfs family?\n\nYou're deliberately ignoring the actual reasons why were meeting on this specific day", "He IS telling them in in advance, the next gathering is in May, there are multiple family gatherings a year (around 4), he can skip one. Honestly, if they get upset over 1 absence they would be the assholes.", ">They could\u2019ve made plans in that year or the next to try and meet up.\n\nBut they didn't or things didn't align until this meeting possibility. I'm not denying that maybe people will be upset, but honestly he is just the bf of a family member right now, his presence is not that big of a deal.\n\nYou didn't say anything disrespectful at all and If i gave any impression of feeling disrespected or angry at you, I am sorry and it was not my intention at all.", "I meant earlier as in other days. Not that particular day.", "No they could ask for any vacation days they had to try and meet with everyone to make a little reunion I accounted for them living in different parts. You ignored what I said. I said they could ask for any vacation days they had or request days off to plan this in the 2 years you guys were apart. I understand we have opposing views and I\u2019m sorry but you haven\u2019t convinced me that you\u2019re NTA so we should end this convo here. My opinion still stands YTA", "I get that there are four. What I\u2019m saying is that he already AGREED to the plans. If he had said I\u2019m not sure about that day because idk if I\u2019ll be busy that day then I completely would say NTA but he agreed. That\u2019s where I\u2019m finding the issue at. Ya know maybe next time just don\u2019t agree until you know for certain that particular day you\u2019re free", "No you\u2019re good I\u2019ll admit I am a little biased on the situation cuz I\u2019d be upset if anyone canceled on me so I\u2019ll mention that out there. I\u2019ll retract my opinion and say he\u2019s NTA", "Yeah and like I've said we're nowhere near each other in other days. This day works because we're all nearby so can actually meet up", "Yeah I disagree completely with you tbh. You don't seem to understand that there are genuine reasons for changing plans", "I was free when I initially agreed but again you don't seem to understand that things come up that cause plans to change.", "We're more alike than you think. That plans are not contracts line was something that my therapist told me once ;D"]}
