{"id": 17342, "submission_id": "13iprkz", "title": "AITA for not cooking a western enough meal when having guests over?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (24M) and I (21F) have recently hosted a dinner at his place with some of his coworkers and their partners. He recently got a promotion at work and his friends over there were asking for a treat. I'm South Asian (Bangladeshi) and sometimes when I have leftovers from some of the traditional dishes I cook; I pack it for his lunch. Apparently many of his coworkers liked the smell and look of his food and some even tried it and liked it. \n\nSo when I asked him if we should just invite them at his place where I would cook some traditional dinner; he got excited and said yes. He gave me a heads up that two of them are vegetarian. For dinner, I cooked white rice, tomato chutney, mashed potatoes, spinach, onion fritters, fried eggplants, chinese vegetables, spicy egg curry, chicken curry, lentils with green mango. For dessert, I made gajar halwa (carrot based pudding). I also served veg strips snack and beverages before dinner as an evening snack. \n\nAll of them seemed to love my cooking and kept complimenting me throughout the night. They also asked me many questions about the ingredients and what is the best way to eat each of them and I was happy to answer those. \n\nAfter they all left, my boyfriend started ranting \"what was that all about?\" I got very confused and apparently when he assumed I was gonna cook traditional meals, he thought it would be more like what they serve at the weddings (biryani, chicken roast, spicy beef curry, kebab, fried fish, and other type of veggie dishes). He thought what we served was not up to the standards; especially when guests are over. I argued that most of my dishes were vegetarian friendly and these are comfort food which are also quite tasty since they were all seasoned properly and made from scratch. He keeps saying that he should've just taken them to a restaurant and that I'm lucky none of them are Indian or something. Otherwise they'd be able to tell that we just fed them \"grass\". I was very hurt by that comment since I put a very high effort into all of that cooking when I don't even live there. \n\nI want some fresh outside perspective.

You deserve better.", "NTA. My mouth was watering reading what you cooked. I thought it had a good mix...and normally what you will find in restaurants too (if they order those meal sets). Maybe show him this post and see if he understands that he overreacted...and that he might need to learn more about your culture.", " NTA. He\u2019s not quite an asshole he\u2019s just an underdeveloped sphincter", "NTA, dump him fam. I cannot believe he disrespected mango daal and begun bhaji like that \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d that is a Bengali feast. Just because it's not biryani doesnt mean it's not good and traditional, and any south asian who would come to your home would eat everything up. \n\nStop cooking for him and packing him lunch. If he won't respect Bengali food, he doesn't deserve it.", "NTA. You made a special meal for your boyfriend and his coworkers. Your boyfriend needs to be more grateful and thankful for what you did. If he wanted a specific dinner he should had said something or made it himself.", "NTAH and I thought your menu sounded really, really tasty.", "NTA ditch the boyfriend and invite me next time. That sound amazing", "NTA. I would be honoured to have someone cook a meal like that for me.

You deserve better. NTA.", "NTA.  Indian restaurants are the only restaurants where I\u2019m happily eating the vegetarian dishes more than the meat dishes because *it\u2019s done so well*.", "NTA.  This sounds like a perfect meal, and it sounds like they were all not only excited to eat the food but greatly enjoyed it as well.", "NTA\n\nThat dinner sounds AMAZING.\n\nYour boyfriend does not. You did something wonderful for his coworkers and he:\n- didn\u2019t get involved in preparations (not only didn\u2019t help but didn\u2019t even take enough notice to know what you were serving?!)\n- berated you for what you cooked despite you getting compliments\n- didn\u2019t thank you for doing something you absolutely didn\u2019t need to do to make *him* look better to his coworkers\n- said you should have taken them to a restaurant (WTF?)\n- threw in some casual racism just in case he hadn\u2019t been AHy enough at this point.\n\nInvite him to an \u2018apology dinner\u2019, serve him grass on a plate, and dump his ungrateful backside.", "NTA. And everything you made sounds incredible, and apparently his coworkers thought so too.", "NTA. Next time he can cook.", "Nta.. he sounds super ungrateful.

I\u2019ll sign up because those dishes sound incredible and I\u2019d love to learn how to cook them.", "Ditch the dud.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He wanted mass produced and you created what sounds like a fun and delicious feast! Comfort food! Onion fritters!

And to pull off so many dishes, damn!", "The food the menu is amazing and it takes a huge amount of patience to make the things you listed \nAnd that too when guests come over I know how much pressure we take in ( India here )\nSo absolutely no you are NTA and an amazing chef", "NTA, your bf sounds like a dick", "NTA and the *audacity* of him to say you're lucky none of them are Indian when you're freakin' Bangladeshi.", "Yo that food sounds gas if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want it let me know I\u2019ll eat it", "as an indian that all sounds delicious!", "Nta you can cook for me", "NTA.

You shared your cooking and culture.  You put effort and love into your food.  You accommodated the vegetarians.  I want to be your friend because you sound amazing.  Your boyfriend is an ass.", "NTA. And my colleagues and I would absolutely love that menu. Tell him next time (If there is a next time) to take them to a restaurant as he seems to be embarrassed by your cooking.", "NTA. That sounds like an incredible job you did and a ton of work. Your bf is an immature, insecure idiot. Oh, and an ungrateful asshole.", "NTA \nTime to find a new boyfriend, OP! You had all this trouble, made everything from scratch, and he acts like that? Nah, girl, dump his ass, and find someone who appreciates you!", "NTA by 1000%\n\nYou, single handedly, cooked and prepared inclusive dishes for everyone and not only that, you brought amazing cultural dishes that some people may or may not ever get a chance to try via tender loving care of a home cooked meal. \n\nYa boyfriend however didn't do shit and had the **audacity** to complain??????? \n\nEither \n\nA.Stop packing him lunch and let him do it his damn self.\n\nB.Get a boyfriend who appreciates you. (I highly advise this choice)", "NTA. Sounds like you were more popular than he was at his party so he is picking a fight   Sorry", "As a fellow Bengali, I am salivating at your description of the menu. Sounds amazing!\n\nTotally NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like a jerk though. Obviously he was hoping you would feed them biyer barir (wedding) food, because he has a narrow idea of the kind of traditional dishes that would be appreciated by his co-workers. You made them truly authentic Bengali food that they're unlikely to find in a typical Indian restaurant. It's too bad your boyfriend couldn't appreciate your effort.", "Sounds like your boyfriend is being unreasonable. You worked hard to cook a feast for his friends. I'd be so appreciative to have a woman in my life who'd do that for me.", "NTA the first and primary rule of hospitality is making sure the guests feel welcomed and safe. Sounds like you did that. For most westerners, a multicourse meal made from scratch is the highest of compliments especially if it tastes wonderful. I will take basic spaghetti with meat sauce (easy to prep) over a steak and potatoes if the first was made with kindness and compassion while the second was made from obligation and martyrdom.", "Stop cooking for him, and definitely stop preparing his lunches since he does not appreciate you and all the time, work and thought you put into cooking.  \n\nYou spent hours shopping, cooking and making the table for entertaining and feeding his co-workers and he dared to insult and belittle you.  You are a gem and deserve someone who appreciates, praises and is grateful that you put so much work into their career and well being. \n\nHe owes you a massive apology that should come with flowers and expensive jewelry like 2 carat diamond earings.", "NTA and your boyfriend doesn\u2019t deserve you nor does he respect you. really think over what he did to you here and decide if that\u2019s who you want to be with in life.", "NTA. Jeez, ditch him and open restaurant.", "NTA, but you can put a fork in this relationship because it is over.\n         \nIt doesn't matter that what you did was beyond perfectly fine and a tremendous amount of work. The problem is that your bf has no respect or regard for all of the work you did.  \n        \nPlease, please, please, just leave. He is not worth your time or amazing cooking.", "You were great. He is the AH", "NTA. Your boyfriend was very jealous of the attention that all your hard work garnered and likely felt slighted. He is weak. Find another. By the sounds of it, the right one just has to follow his nose!", "NTA \n\nAlso can I get an invite for the next one? Lol", "NTA. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t deserve you, and then he was disrespectful. He needs a very strongly worded conversation about expectations and how to speak to you.", "I am absolutely disgusted by the BF. Not only did he not help, but I was pretty sure he did not even notice what she was cooking. \n\nThis was an intricate complex menu. I think she is an excellent cook because and she is downplaying the effort that went into this.  \n\nThis is elite South Asian cooking.  Each of the dishes requires a different technique. Especially Gajar ka halwa is so labor intensive.  \n\nBravo to OP for making such a thoughtful menu. Please never doubt yourself. \n\nYour guests can eat restaurant dishes anywhere.  They are lucky to have an excellent home cooked meal.", "I\u2019m curious what BF\u2019s background is since she made a point to note she\u2019s Bangladeshi.", "As an Indian I feel like judging her food the way he did is borderline racist\u2026 would he have reacted like that if she served mashed potatoes and tofurkey?", "He's upset because the menu was not costly enough, and he thinks he's been embarrassed in front of his colleagues.\n\nHe's wrong, and an idiot, and a bad boyfriend.  Did I forget anything?", "Ooooh good point!  Maybe girlfriend was a little too much of a hit and now lil man is jealous?", "I also didn't get the Indian comment? Like Indian food is so veggie friendly! What the heck\n\nNTA OP. But man I wish I was at your dinner it sounds amazing", "Honestly it\u2019s not low key racist. It\u2019s high key racist. Also he\u2019s a moron.", "Not to mention it sounds like the guests did in fact enjoy the meal and the experience, so bf was breeding problems and resentment where there were none. \n\nRead that again, OP\u2026. if not for your _boyfriend_ this evening would have been a great success. Everything _you_ did was wonderful. Your BF is the problem", "Right?!", "Fixed your answer\u2026\nNTA. You're not a mind reader. If he wants celebration style food, HE NEEDS TO COOK IT HIMSELF. What you fixed sounds good.", "There was chicken and egg curry too! OP's menu seemed very thoughtful.", "So funny story. I\u2019m a teacher who teaches kids new to the country. Many years ago, I had a student from Bangladesh. Such a sweet kid. One day he comes in with this gigantic plate of food. He had helped his mom make curried goat and they wanted to make me a plate. Super sweet. \n\nI took one bite, told him it was amazing but that I was full from lunch but I would enjoy it for dinner at home then gave it to a neighbor. I have the wimpiest of taste buds. Stuff that is mild to most people has a kick to me. That one bite had me sweating and my mouth feeling like I just ate fire. Man, I wish I could have enjoyed it. It smelled amazing.", "When I was preparing for the meal, my thought process was that not everyone can eat the meat dishes but everyone is capable of trying all the vegetarian based dishes.", "What? Even when you're making a meal for a group that doesn't have vegetarians, not every dish has to include meat.", "When you\u2019re not the one cooking, shut up and say thank you. Ungrateful pinecone.", "Indian restaurant and wedding food is simplified Punjabi cuisine for the most part. OP made complex dishes from all over that North American Indians would kill to be able to get at regular restaurants.", "He's likely either Bangladeshi or Indian, since he seems to be familiar enough with the foods to have a strong opinion on whether they are formal enough to be served to colleagues. Still an AH either way though.", "Thats a good question, I'm from that general region and I know what its like", "You forgot he's probably going to need to look for a new girlfriend after pulling that bs.", "Man clearly has no idea how many spices were likely used in those dishes and how much they cost.", "Single?", "Sounds like it!   **NTA OP,** but somebody (aka BF) seems upset they were not the one getting all the praise!", "For sure! I'm vegetarian, my kids and their SOs are not...plus one kid & SO are lactose intolerant...we always struggle to find a place that has something for everyone. Indian food is a lifesaver for us! And I never feel like I've had \"grass\" for my meal when I eat an Asian vegetarian dish...unlike when I'm stuck with a salad, which is often the only vegetarian option at many American-style restaurants...", "NTA but I urge you to consider whether you will have a happy future with such an ungrateful and uncaring person.", "You\u2019re entirely right. This is the norm anyway, even outside of vegetarian concerns. There\u2019s often only one main meat item and then a bunch of sides, salads, etc which are usually/often vegetarian by default.", "Everyone is also capable of eating all meat dishes (even the vegetarians). Catering to the minority while disregarding the majority is never a good idea. That's why you should have made it 50-50.", "Same thought. This little argument is weird. Who the hell has meat for every single meal they cook? I like meat but I don\u2019t put it in every meal I have. Making it majority vegetarian isn\u2019t bad and honestly just prevents the vegetarians from accidentally ingesting meat which if they aren\u2019t used to could make them super sick.", "[removed]", ">Ungrateful pinecone.\n\nTotally did not just spit out my drink laughing. You're my new favorite human! Be my friend? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nOP is NTA for making vegetarian dishes. I have some close friends who are vegetarian, and they get sick if they eat meat now. And I'm not vegetarian, but will happily eat vegetarian meals and love them! I just like tasty food, and even more so when I'm not the one who made it!", "Hey man, not everyone who eats meat eats it every meal/day.", "If someone is vegetarian they may not be able to digest meat. It would make them sick. Making the meal 50-50 excludes the vegetarians from 50% of the meal. That is not fair at all.", "And it wasn't,  there were a bunch of sides anyone could eat and a meat main and a veg main."]}
