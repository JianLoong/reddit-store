My mom died a month a ago. A week after, my father got himself a girlfriend. He told us he is madly in love with his gf. \n\nMy mom had a neurodegenerative disease for 30 years and my father was the primary care taker. He took good care of her. We knew how tired he was but he always said he wouldn't trade it for the world.\n\nTo be honest, it wasn't a surprise that my mom was dying. It was a matter of when. \n\nAfter she died, my father wanted everything hers out of the house immediately. He said it was too hard to see her things around. He also told us the house was too quiet and it was very difficult for him to be alone.\n\nA week after, he announced he has a girlfriend and she is a mutual friend of theirs for 20+ years. We were shocked.\n\n\n\nMy sister became very angry with my dad and I was too at first. We excluded the gf from our family gatherings. Our sis told her kids that she was disappointed with dad. (My dad loves the grandkids. They are his Achilles heels.)\n\nEverytime my dad talked about her, we would try to change the topic. We did not hide our dismay\n\nHis GF told her family about dating our dad and they didn't take it well. GF wasn't invited to any Christmas dinner. She was alone in her house. \n\nAfter talking with some Redditors, I started to sympathise with dad. He had said his goodbye years ago. He is 70+ yrs old. He has waited for 20+ years already.\n\nMy birthday is coming up and I plan to invite her to my b-day dinner and tell my sister.\n\nMy sis is very opinionated. She has made it very clear that she doesn't like the new GF. She calls her \"our replacement mom\".\n\nI know siding with dad will upset sis. AITA if I choose to side with dad. I want him to be happy. He is now enjoying his life. (Going out several times a week. In the past, he had to stay home with mom.) \n\n**Update: I forgot to mention that the new gf also has the same neurodegenerative disease, albeit much more mild. Also she isn't new to us.

Not just start dating someone. your sister has every right to be upset. YOU guys just said bye to her. He needs to put you both first and he didn\u2019t. He might have said goodbye long ago, but you and your sister said goodbye a week before. In 7 days your dad expected your sister to have an empty house, no trace of her mom, and a new step mom. He\u2019s TA x 1000000000000. I hope you see this from a new POV to understand your sisters pain. He\u2019s not just dating, he\u2019s erasing.", "NAH\n\nDad can do what he wants. \n\nYou can do what you want. \n\nSister can understandably be upset. This is a pretty weird turn around.", "NAH, just an impossible situation.  You are being kind and forgiving, which is a hard but good thing to do.", "NAH. She has a right to be upset, he has said goodbye to your mom years earlier. However, I doubt they suddenly started dating this serious.", "NTA.  \n\nOP, you do realize they didn\u2019t just start dating, right?  Brace yourself to be told in a few months that they have actually been a couple for several years behind your mom\u2019s back.  All the clues are there.", "NAH tbh,\n\nI get both viewpoints, your dad needing someone to fill the void and spend his time (and probably have fun with) but also your sister who isnt over her mom.", "NAH. Reality is, your parents relationship turned into patient/caretaker a long time ago. He already mourned the loss of his wife as she was to him. He had accepted that, and he\u2019s not an AH. He\u2019s a great person to have stood by his vows and been with your mom through the end as the relationship changed\u2026 but he\u2019s still his own person with his own wants and needs too.\n\nThat said, you and your sister just lost your mother and seeing your father with a new woman so quickly can understandably be a difficult transition. Old friend or not, I can understand not wanting her there the first Christmas without mom, and wanting time between mom\u2019s passing and dad\u2019s new girlfriend. Dad needs to pull back on gf talk around sister for a while imo, and sister needs to realize that dad shouldn\u2019t be alone forever and will need to come to terms with that in time too.", "She doesn't need to replace anyone, your dad just may wanna start living again after so long. He was good to your mom but that must have been tremendously hard on him too.\n\nNAH", "No way anyone's spouse dies and a week later they're in a full blown relationship. It's going to come out in the future that they've been together much longer than you thought! I'm sorry you're going through this but YTA for falling for his story.", "NTA\n\nYour dad was a care-giving for 20 years. I absolutely get that he wants to enjoy the rest of his life. But there is something I don't get: why did he already present you his new girlfriend? And why should anyone invite a new girlfriend of (officially) only 1 month to Christmas???? (Or to any other family gathering).\nOkay, they probably saw each other a while already and I don't even judge the dad for it in this situation. The dad and the girlfriend still should have kept for a little while for themselves and have fun with each other without make their relationship that big so soon. In a couple of monthes then meet the children and MAYBE next year invite her for Christmas.", "ESH except your mom and sister\n\nObviously that woman is an old girlfriend/sidepiece", "NTA but I do think your dad is handling this wrong. Even if he's moved on, you and your sister have not. He should be so acutely aware of that and not be shoving his new gf in your faces. He's allowed to move on, especially with the circumstances of your mom's death, but he should also be aware that you two are still grieving, even if he's been done with his process. He should be empathetic because what he's doing is hurting his family. So, I think he's going about this in the wrong way.\n\nYou and your sister are fine, neither of you are assholes for feeling the way you do. He is for not recognizing that, for you two, it's still too soon.", "NAH. Everyone\u2019s feelings here are valid, including the angry, hurt sister.", "Esh dad had the gf before mom died. She is not ready for dad to move on. She needs time to grieve. You are all right with him moving on but are invalidating your sister's very real pain", "NTA. OMG you are all adults here. You sister is acting like a child. This woman is your father's companion. He did not start a relationship to give your sister a new mother. She needs to either stay out of everything or keep her mouth shut at family events. All she's doing is making herself look like an asshole.", "I am so sorry for everyone involved in this, because really it seems that individuals trying to make themselves happy is in turn upsetting and making others feel a certain way... yikes!\n\n\nEmotions towards new gf and dad are understanding of all involved. 1 month is very quick, but like you said, very unfortunate circumstances and he's old...\n\nYour sis should be able to grieve and have time and space to recover... yet is watching dad move on...\n\n\nYou wanna have everyone at your bday because it seems like a nice gesture and all...\n\nNone of these are wrong, no-one is AH... this is just extremely difficult time for everyone involved. Sorry for loss, trauma, from all this, may everyone find peace...", "First of all, I am so sorry for your family's loss, especially after a long illness, everyone can be drained.\n\nYou're NTA, but I think it's time that you,your dad, and your sister sat down and talked this out. The timing is very ...odd, but like several have suggested, I wonder if your mother and he discussed ahead of time the possibility of him dating/having relationships even before she physically died when she could no longer be that for him? Perhaps they've been seeing each other with her blessings? Or maybe they bonded quickly over the emotional grief and the long term friendship?\nI don't know which neurodegenerative disease she had, but some of the long term ones (Alzheimer's, Huntingtons, ALS) can take away some much of a person that they often make plans for such things.\n\nI understand your sister is grieving and might not want to listen, but it's best to clear the air so she doesn't lose another parent.", "NAH\n\nEveryone's grief si different. But this is very recent. **Your dad** has been grieving for years but **your sister** is grieving now. He got rid of everything that was her mother's and doesn't even want any trace of her (fairly common in care givers, it gets too much) and \"replaces\" her in 7 days. Of course she would be upset, as most would be. \n\nFor your dinner, **you have to choose** between your sister or your dad's gf or risk this being a drama filled and hurtful dinner for everyone. Personally, I would choose your sister. She is hurt and grieving (as is your father of course but it is different). It's sad that your dad's gf is being excluded but your father's actions hurt everyone and what they did is not accepted by a lot of people. (Especially because I believe they were dating before your mother passed). \n\nIf this happened with my family I don't know if I could forgive my father and your sister seems to direct these emotions to his gf (because she also knew the circumstances). \n\nAll in all, I think everyone should go to grief counseling, but your father has to understand his actions have consequences.", "Is it possible they started dating before your mom died? For him to have a gf just days after burying his wife seems crazy. There is probably more to the story. \nYou can invite her but be prepared for your relationship with your sister/family to change forever. As long as you are ready for the consequences of your actions go right ahead", "NAH. Timing on this is suspicious and I get your sister's frustrations, but everyone processes grief differently", "YTA", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely mature of you to realize that your dad is a human too. He has feelings. I\u2019ve seen men leave their dying wives because they can handle it. He is a good man and deserves happiness.", "This is a super hard situation- it happened in our family. You are NTA and neither is your sister. \n\nYou are doing a beautiful thing that your Dad will always appreciate- you are being kind and understanding in the most difficult circumstance- in the midst of grief. Your sister is coming from a different viewpoint- she is hurt and angry. Stress that you love her but you are inviting everyone and you truly hope she will come and make an effort. \n\nHopefully one day she will realize it isn\u2019t about her, your Dad deserves some happiness- his grieving had been done over he past years when your Mom was sick. Give everyone time.\nEdited to add: please talk with the GF- explain and apologize for not including her in the holidays. Likely she is grieving your Mom too and she may be in your family for a long time. Good luck to you- you sound like a wonderful son and brother.", "NTA\n\nThere was no way to win for anyone here.\n\nYour dad handled it poorly in terms of timing and your mom's things but.... from his point of view, it's been like 20 years. It's sad but he did his grieving already. \n\nAt a certain point, he had to let go of the romantic side of the relationship.... he remained devoted but it's a different thing.", "NTA but I think both your dad and your sis are.\n\nDad's moving just a little too fast and if he intended to do this and all of you knew your mom was dying, he should have had an open discussion with both of you about his intentions when the day would come. And your sis is an adult who doesn't (or shouldn't) need a replacement mom so on that front I think she needs to be a little more tolerant of how long your dad's been a caretaker.\n\nI think both of them are not really thinking about the other's feelings very much.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t about the love your dad had (and has) for your mom.\n\nIt is about the happiness of your dad.  And about is ability to date whoever he chooses.  How would sister feel if he broke up with her because of her opposition?  And your dad was totally miserable?", "NAH. I get why you and your sister were/are mad. It seems too soon after the loss of your mother. But I can also underdtand your dad. Depending on your mother's disease, their relationship changed from being spouses to a caregiver situation, maybe years, maybe decades ago. He stood by her and cared for her well-being.\n\nNow he is \"free\" to live a more carefree life, to find someone to be in an adult relationship with...his gf was likely a big help during the years, maybe a shoulder to cry on, to vent when things got tough. It's not so surprising they got attached.\n\nCould he have waited a while longer to make it official? Sure. But I do hope your sister gets over her resentment. She can't imagine what your father's life was like, what he was missing so she shouldn't judge too harshly imo. And she should definitely leave her kids out of this!! That the only asshole-ish thing you wrote, that she involved her kids, told them she is mad at theit grandpa  WTF?\n\nBut you are NTA for wanting to accept your father's new gf into the family. Just make sure your sister behaves hersrlf or this will likely become a shit-show.", "Nah, your mother died and that affects everyone differently. With someone as sick as your mother, it isn't surprising how fast dad moved on.\n\nWhen my grandmother died, I was relieved. A weight was lifted And it wasn't because I didn't love her, but rather because I did. In the last few years of her life, she was just a shell. Her mind gone. People don't realize when you watch your love one like that, you are saying goodbye every day. You are already grieving.\n\nWhen my grandfather died, he was still all there. Still the loveable man we all loved. That killed us.\n\nSo my heart goes to your sister, she shouldn't be so hard on your dad.", "I\u2019m willing to take the down votes, but I bet you 1,000$ your dad 100% cheated on your mom. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s the truth, there\u2019s no damn way they were in a full blown relationship in less than a week.\n\nI\u2019m siding with your sister, YTA", "YTA for thinking this is about \"choosing sides\".\n\nYour dad really messed up here. Not for seeing this woman. I personally wouldn't blame him for seeing her before your mother passed. Being a caretaker for 20 years is a lot. A lot, a lot. He needed additional support, and I can completely understand that. (NOTE: This is not a pass for a spouse to cheat while their partner is sick, but caring for your dying partner for 20 years has some built-in exemptions)\n\nHe messed up thinking that he could just flip the switch for you, your sister, and the rest of your family and friends. He had to deal w/ loosing her a long time ago, but it was new to the rest of you. He sped up the process to get everything out of the house MAY be because he couldn't live with the reminders, but it looks and more importantly FEELS like erasure of your mother to everyone else and I'm sure felt like a slap in the face to many people who cared for her.\n\nI'm not saying he should have lied about his GF, but he shouldn't have told you quite so soon and he shouldn't have just expected you to be OK w/ it or expect that it would be fine to just start showing up w/ her on his arm to family events.\n\nHe screwed up and he needs to 100% own it and own that his screw up made the transition worse and delayed the acceptance of his new GF/new life.\n\nYou can be ready to move on and accept the new GF, but that doesn't mean you have to ignore your sister's pain or think she should \"just get over it\". She may come around in time, but your dad botched this at a pretty high level, so it may take awhile.\n\nIn the meantime, your dad should apologize to your sister for how he handled the situation and if your dad wants to spend time w/ your sister and her family, he will need to not bring the GF to the events. Your sister's presence at events should take precedence in the short term. If you want to meet theGF, that is fine, but don't try to pressure or guilt your sister into doing the same or even discuss it w/ her if she doesn't want to.\n\nIf your sister doesn't come around after a bit, then try family counseling w/ the 3 of you, but give her some time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your dad deserves some happiness after taking care of his wife and watching her fade away before his eyes.", "NTA\n\nThis is something really hard for everybody involved, and ppl are human and have feelings. This is a hard one to process. Several years after my stepdad passed, my Mom started dating again and it was weird. She\u2019s always had bad relationships and started dating a conservative man, while she is a liberal. It\u2019s hard for ppl to date, the older they get. I was upset that she was dating this ass-hole. I didn\u2019t like him at all, but I can\u2019t tell a grown adult what to do.  If it had been one week after my step dad died? I\u2019d probably have been incredibly angry and wanted to punch the guy\u2019s face in. One week after your mom died is TERRIBLE judgement on your dad\u2019s part. Most people grieve for at least a month or longer. What your dad did was incredibly selfish and disrespectful to you and your sister. Maybe they had already been dating a while. So what? On the other hand, imagine your Dad having to be a caretaker for several years and doing all that work and being in a relationship with no intimacy. He\u2019s human. Humans aren\u2019t robots. It must have been very challenging to try and please everyone, navigating it all, and keeping his sanity. Now, you and your sister are giving him a hard time. Did you both not like his new g/f before you found out? Was she not a nice person? Or, are you just rejecting her because she\u2019s the new woman? Regardless of your Dad being stupid, you now are in the situation you find yourself in. I guess you\u2019re going to have to decide 1) if you can forgive your dad for being a dumbass, and 2) if you can accept the new gf. If the answer is no for either question, then you need to confront your dad and tell him firmly that you can\u2019t have a relationship as long as he\u2019s dating new woman. If you can\u2019t do that you need to try and forgive him and try to accept the situation, as displeasing as it may be. And, you need to be firm with your sister that she has to accept your choice. If your sister reacts negatively, then you can\u2019t help that. \n\nI would suggest telling your dad how much he\u2019s hurt you and your sister with the poor behavior, then forgiving him.

He isn't AH for that. But never once did he think how his actions would impact his own children. Getting rid of all her stuff straight away was too much for her children, as was dating within a week of her passing. That was incredibly unseemly and disrespectful. He could of waited a while, certainly be way more discreet. It was also disrespectful to his gf because he didn't care how she would be accepted by his children. He was only ever thinking of himself and his own freedom. I think I'm on the sister's side with this one.", "well i cannot say you are not, considering how things started, but you are beginning to learn that your dad deserves to move one instead of forcing him to live in the past, and then ignoring something that obviously helps him deal with the grief of losing his wife.", "OP, NTA.. but obviously they did not just start dating, it's been going on for a while. \n\nDon't be naive!", "NTA He can't handle being alone.

Your dad has every right to move on and so do you, but you have to move on in a way that still respect the grief of others. It\u2019s not unreasonable to not have your dads new gf at the first Christmas since your moms death. I think the way your dad is handling this makes him an AH. If your mom had been dying for so long, he should have helped her put a plan in place for how things would go following her death.", "NTA.

He had been caring for his wife for a long time and deserves to take care of himself first for a change.\n\nOP, thank you for supporting your father's choices. NTA", "Actually, it is a pretty ordinary reaction for a long-term caregiver. Your dad has had  very much a patient instead of a partner 24/7 for years. I think you and your sister cannot comprehend this yet. Although you care for a partner with love,  it is a physical and emotional self-sacrifice that takes so much toil, that it is a releave to be free again. In a care situation you grieve the partner long before they are gone. This is a natural process which enables the care otherwise you would resent the partner and disengage. Your dad needed the closure. Additionally, a warning: Your dad is in a high danger of a physical breakdown (also a reaction from the releave of care situation). Having a new partner might help preventing this .", "I totally see your point, and 9/10 times I agree, if something looks sus it usually is... but I have known people, not me, that get rid of everything right away. My grandmother did before my grandfathers funeral, clothes, car, everything. They married for almost 40 years,he got sick she didn't want any reminder in the home. We all walked into the house shocked, she did it alone. \n\nShe said she couldn't take the reminder of him being gone...\n\nNot saying what this is, but illness and different forms of grief can breed weird ideas.", "Disagree. \n\nThe Dad stood by his wife for 30+ years including being her carer. I know what that looks like; he's likely had his life on hold, or at least massively restricted, for decades, whilst he was dedicated & devoted... it  can be a kind of purgatory. I'd say he's earned another shot at happiness now that she's gone and he's all alone. The children are grown ups with their own families & kids; their own houses; why should he be forced to endure a period of loneliness for their benefit?\n\nThe Dad isn't required to keep the Mum's things around for the sake of appearances or for the benefit of others if it is to the detriment of his own happiness. No-one's stopping the sister or brother from taking the stuff they want, either.

Just means he's beginning a new one. \n\nThis situation sucks for you and your sister and the pain for you is still incredibly fresh. It will some day not be the tsunami of pain it currently is.
