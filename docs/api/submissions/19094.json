The other is a converted detached garage studio apartment. The tenants are a newly married couple, the husband did a lot of work himself to finish the conversion from garage to apartment and we give him a deal on rent because of it. Usually I could get maybe 1200, but we charge 800. I have also given them a break and let them skip a month of rent because he helped my husband build a chicken coop. \n\nWe get along fine, but I\u2019m in my backyard a lot and I like my privacy. Which is why I told them in the very beginning that eventually I plan on doing something to give myself more privacy from their kitchen window which faces my house and yard. It\u2019s been around 8 months since then and they mostly have kept the window closed, or the blinds semi open. Well recently her parents were visiting and they had the blinds all the way open, one day I was out there in my nightgown and didn\u2019t realize it was open and then once I did I was mortified and ran back in the house. The window being open has been the new norm even after her parents left. \n\nI feel like this is an invasion or an encroachment of my privacy. I want to be in my yard and not be worried about people looking at me. So I decided to get some woven wood blinds and while they are on vacation I had my husband install them to the outside of the window. They haven\u2019t returned yet, but when my oldest son visited he said he thinks it\u2019s rude especially to do while they were on vacation. I told him I planned on telling them before they return. He still says it should have been a conversation that happened first before doing it. I told him it\u2019s my house/property and it\u2019s my prerogative to do what I want to it. He agreed it\u2019s my property but that they pay rent and it should have been communicated first and that if he had a landlord do this he would have been irritated/angry because it blocks natural light and was done without communication. I told him it still lets in natural light, but just gives me a bit more privacy. \n\nI feel torn, because I want my privacy and feel entitled to it, but I also like this couple and don\u2019t want to upset them. I also initially did tell them that something like this might happen. \n\nWIBTAH if I left these blinds up?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone. I did this post on behalf of my mom from her perspective per her request. I may have not included all the information or insight as she has, but I made it based on the conversation I had with her today. \n\nI agree with your guys judgements. She however does not. But she has though since texted them and gave them a heads up and an apology for not communicating it better and that they are still navigating on how to be landlords. The tenants responded kindly and it seems at this point resolved. I gave her your guys suggestions of frosting the glass instead of these blinds and also that she should be careful doing modifications after they have already been living there and paying rent. \n\nShe should have communicated with them prior to doing anything, but she has issues with conflict whether she recognizes that or not.", "created_utc": 1686013997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141yqio/wibtah_if_i_installed_blinds_on_the_outside_of_my/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re messing up their ability to enjoy natural light in their home\u2026so you don\u2019t have to put pants on in your backyard? You rent a house in your yard, that impacts your privacy. If you don\u2019t want that, don\u2019t rent it out.\n\nThe \u2018thing to give you more privacy\u2019 you could reasonably do would be building a fence between your yard and theirs.

Also, you've essentially bricked up their kitchen window so you can run around your backyard in your nightie. That sounds nuts and more than a little rude.

Don't put a rental property in your yard if you want privacy. You can't expect your tenants to keep shades down all the time", "YTA. You're basically renting them a property and then dictating which windows they're allowed to look through. Yeah, but NO. If you wanted privacy you shouldn't have rented out the property that overlooks your yard.", "YTA\n\nThis is totally inappropriate and unethical.\n\nYou are unilaterally changing a rental after people have moved into it!\n\nYou voluntarily sold someone something and are now complaining that them using the thing you sold them is a violation\u2026", "Yes, YWBTA.\n\nYour oldest son is correct. There needs to be communication with them before doing it. I get you mentioned something would be done, but that was so long ago that most likely the conversation would need to be had again. Realistically this should have been addressed before they moved in during the remodeling cuz the window could\u2019ve been closed back then but oh well.\n\nYou could just put a tinted screen on the glass. That makes it blurry to see outside. That way if the tenants would like outside light they still have it while protecting your privacy cuz they can\u2019t see outside through that window.", "YWBTA. As someone who has been both a renter and a landlord, you should consider the area they rent as their property while they live there; you cannot tell them to close curtains in their own house. If you want more privacy, you will need to build a fence or screen on your property separating your yard from their rented section (but make sure you don't break any other rules, such as blocking their window, or if you had agreed to shared use of the yard).", "YWBTA.\n\nYour only expectation of privacy should be inside the walls of your own home. If someone not on your property could see it, it's not private.

That\u2019s a quick way to go to tribunal and you\u2019ll lose. \n\nPut the blinds on your window and keep them closed when you\u2019re dressing, Or get better nightgowns so you don\u2019t feel embarrassed.", "I'm having a hard time picturing these blinds. Could you share a link to what they look like?", "Yeah, YTA. It\u2019s not fair for tenants to have a forcibly shaded window sprung on them while they\u2019re on vacation. Why not just ask them to draw their blinds as a favor to you when they get back from vacation. Seemed like they were OK with it before. They may have just forgotten about your request for privacy. \n\nIf you really must add those blinds that they don\u2019t have control over, wait until they need to renew their lease and make a condition of the new lease that you are allowed to install external blinds. \n\nBut honestly, just talk to them first.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve talked to them first. Also, it\u2019s rude to think people shouldn\u2019t open their blinds just because you want privacy. If privacy was so important, you shouldn\u2019t be renting the place", "YTA your son is right!", "YTA \n\nI would never do something like that with the tenant away, especially given you seem to have a good rapport with them.  I also think outside blinds is an odd solution.  Why not frost the window?  That would allow them to have light come in and allow you your privacy.", "YTA and a coward for not having the conversation before hand, doing it while on vacation and for being a freak. \n\nDon\u2019t rent it if you want privacy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even legal for you to alter their living space like this", "YTA - you are outside in your nightgown expecting 100% privacy  knowing that others live on the property. You can't put blinds up outside the house and not allow them the use of a window they are paying $800 a month for.", "YTA. \u201cEncroachment?\u201d Because they can see out their window? What you did was *far* more of a violation.", "Definitely a privacy fence or screen or hedge; you can\u2019t cover their window!!! \n\nMaybe you can creatively install a sunshade vertically.", "YWBTA. And a major one at that! What's next? You won't want them to be in the backyard anymore so you'll install shock collars that activate every time they step on the lawn? Maybe they'll only be able to eat foods you approve because you don't want the smell of their cooking to bother your nose?", "YWBTA. Not wanting to be seen in a nightgown is not an excuse to encroach on their living situation, which is also invasive, not to mention your husband would have to look in the windows to install the blinds. Sure they're not there but you're looking in on their home without their permission. Would you be okay with people checking in on your home through the windows while you were away? If they pay for that space, it's theirs. Put on some shorts or a robe or don't rent.", "YTA.  Massively.", "YTA.  Please consider taking them down as soon as possible", "NAH \n\nTalk to the tenants about it and other solutions, but not your son.  I highly recommend frosted glass / glass film. It looks better anyway. \n\nAnd all the people saying, just don\u2019t rent clearly want fewer rentals on the market since they don\u2019t believe in compromising in any way.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. \n\nBut I'd either install a solid pane of frosted glass, or hire someone build a 3 sided box off the house, a foot or so deep, no top/no bottom that'll still allow some light in. \n\nThere's ways to build that like a alternate sided privacy fence that still allows air flow. \n\nI'd block a window overlooking my yard too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
