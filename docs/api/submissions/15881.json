It's a trick that works for me, makes me feel as though I have paid them back and they get to feel nice for giving whatever service, time or effort it was to me e.g. they help me fix the car and refuse payment? Take 'em to the pub and after the first or second-ish drink cover the cost of both your drinks from there on (I wait until first or second as that gives enough time for them to not be expectant and pre-ready to decline).

I can see why you reacted that way based on your previous experience and being more guarded with your wealth, but it is still not the best way to handle that situation. \n\nNow, I am not going to speculate that windows were broken by him, although there's a possibility that it was.

Even if he had been the nicest guy in the world who is just uncomfortable being paid for doing something for a friend, he agreed beforehand.\n\nAlso, a week's worth of work is not something that you can easily just avoid paying for.
