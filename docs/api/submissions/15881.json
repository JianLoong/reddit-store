I would be cautious in case he comes around saying you owe him now \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "NTA. You were upfront from the start about not taking favors. I don't like feeling indebted either so I understand where your coming from. Good job respecting your personal boundaries.", "INFO: How long have the two of you been friends? How did the topic of fixing the roof come up?", "ESH, I totally am with you on the not letting someone do something for free and the fact you made this clear upfront was fair. Him agreeing to be paid and then refusing to take the money is an AH move\n\nThat said you probably shouldn't have snapped at him and perhaps could have explained your feelings on the matter that you hate feeling like you owe someone and even if he doesn't consider it a debt you do and it makes you uncomfortable.", "All the people saying she\u2019s the YTA forget the part about the broken window the day after ? What happened, did he came back to sabotage is own work or the work was already done badly ? You are NTA for protection yourself, you did the right thing", "From the POV of the other person here or even a third party watching the exchange it likely would've appeared like an overreaction/asshole act but I get the not wanting to be in debt to someone ever it's a shitty feeling and even more so when it stems from a past of enduring people's manipulative behaviour. \n\nPersonally if I find myself in a position where someone says something like \"no don't pay me for it!\" Or \"no need to return the favour!\" or something I settle for doing something small in return, small enough that it's casual but just large enough to at least be a nice gesture. It's a trick that works for me, makes me feel as though I have paid them back and they get to feel nice for giving whatever service, time or effort it was to me e.g. they help me fix the car and refuse payment? Take 'em to the pub and after the first or second-ish drink cover the cost of both your drinks from there on (I wait until first or second as that gives enough time for them to not be expectant and pre-ready to decline). It works for me so I figured I'd share it in case it ever helps you in future!\n\nHowever... Given that the windows broke the next day... (Assuming that wasn't just a crazy coincidence) it seems that your concerns were likely accurate \ud83d\ude1e\n\nAn Asshole move? Maybe to some people who've never felt the same way as you it could look like it, sure! \n\nAre you the Asshole? Nah. Simple as that really, nah you're good.", "I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, there are some people out there who are very generous and just love to help people without having devious motives. So getting pissed off at someone who has just helped you makes YTA\n\nThat said I can understand your underlying concern so for these situations why don\u2019t you have a list of say 3-5 charities and say that\u2019s so kind of you to not want to be paid, so I\u2019m going to pay what I would have given you to one of these charities which one would you like me to donate to (or let them nominate another one). That way you have reduced their ability to do what you have said.", "NTA", "NTA and literally a subplot from Andor (which I just finished watching yesterday). That favor would have come calling at some point in the future.", "NTA but get things in writing from now on. People be crazy, yo. I'm sorry that this is probably going to give you trust issues.", "ESH - breaking the windows is ridiculous - but I'm gonna say you definitely have some trust issues to work on. Not everyone who does favours is out for something in return. Some people just genuinely get their yuks from doing nice things for people. \n\nYou could easily have suggested that if he didn't want the money, he could pick a cause and you'd donate to that in his honour. Just because you don't want to be indebted to someone doesn't mean you have to be an asshole about it.\n\nAlso, just because someone might ask you for a favour some day down the line doesn't mean you have to grant it, especially not if it's something that makes you uncomfortable. Someone might even ask you for a favour without having done \\*anything\\* nice for you. You can't get off this treadmill without living in a cave and shouting abuse at anyone who walks by, so why not at least enjoy the benefits of human kindness while accepting that there will always be assholes in the world and there's no way to avoid them?", "Gentle YTA- you may have made a verbal agreement but you should have also have a written one. Either way you should have stepped away saying you both would talk about it another time.

Also If you are wealthy why didn't you pay a professional to fix it?", "YTA\n\nYou were insulting the friendship. You\u2019re also obsessing about money in a really unhealthy way.

He is not a nice person and OP's instincts about the situation were right. He has been trying to manipulate her all along--convincing her to let him do the work and pretending he would accept payment. She definitely didn't have to get so angry, but he responded with violence. His behavior is completely unacceptable and, frankly, worrisome.", "Five years or so, he just started pestering me about it when he noticed a leak", "It\u2019s more if they have done unpaid work on the building it\u2019s considered having some stokehold of the business.

Would you say he was a person whose company you enjoyed or someone you just regularly see or met with as part of a group of friends?  \n\nBecause tbh, it seems more like you've got trust issues all around which skews this a lot. Tentatively, to add judgment, NTA.", "Could he have caused the leak? Given that you think it possible that he broke the windows, is he also the kind of person who would break something before offering to fix it?", "That is useful context about being about to claim, between that and some of your other replies I\u2019d start to lean more towards NTA", "Not as a group of friends, but we talked often, he came over for a cup of tea maybe twice a week, went to the city together once.\n\nI\u2019ve been through the court system after letting someone do a favour and it getting out of hand, it might be trust issues, It\u2019s also learning from experience.", "I am going to have to change my judgment to a gentle ESH then. I am hoping that hanging out with someone that much and for a long period of time would lead to stronger understanding from both sides - him onyour aversion to favours and you on his character.  Snapping at someone who did you a favour isn't good, no matter what. I can see why you reacted that way based on your previous experience and being more guarded with your wealth, but it is still not the best way to handle that situation. \n\nNow, I am not going to speculate that windows were broken by him, although there's a possibility that it was.  Ultimately hope that you have strong trustworthy friendships in the future.", "NTA.\n\nGet a contractor next time - don\u2019t actually let the issue get that far.", "NTA. \u201cNeither a borrower nor a lender be\u201d, *especially* in a small town.", "I thought you were going to say he dropped you off on the way home or something.

A roof is a huge favor so I get wanting to pay for it, but it's sad that you won't accept any favors.", "Honestly from this post I was going to say yta but after Opie explained further; he is clearly NTA and it is better to pay your friends for the service then to acquire a \"family debt\" with the so called friend.", "Also a week worth of work is not doing a favour, it's work.
