Nice try burying \"deep cleaning\" in the middle of that list, but it didn't work. You're busted. The division of labor is your house is very unequal. She does way more than you AND she works? Interesting that you don't even mention having a job...", "YTA. The split doesn't seem very fair - it sounds like you pushed her into this contract then use it as a stick to hit her with. Just an idea but try reversing the whole contract for a month and see if you think it's fair then.", "Your contract is bullshit because it\u2019s so incredibly lopsided in terms of each partner\u2019s responsibilities.

Do you also go in the kitchen after she\u2019s just cleaned it and dirty up a bunch of dishes? Do you require a clean towel for every shower? Do you add more work for her every single day? Because unless you\u2019re doing your best to mitigate your impact on her workload, you\u2019re a GIANT YTA. \n\nAlso, you better ask her how she\u2019s doing, because if it\u2019s not simply fatigue from your dumb ass adding piles of more work for her, it sounds like she\u2019s not doing great, and you\u2019re treating her like a child on top of that. She\u2019s a human being that must have been a vibrant, wonderful person because you married her, and it sounds like you\u2019re sucking the life out of her with how you talk to her.

I would however check out the book \u201cFair play\u201d by Eve Rodsky.\n\nAlso, have you tried a nurturing approach to ask your wife why she isn\u2019t doing the dishes? Take her in your arms and hold her against your chest and ask her if she\u2019s feeling OK and overwhelmed. Being an adult is hard. Being a parent is hard. Being a spouse is hard. Maybe she needs a little bit of warmth. \n\nAs I comment frequently on Reddit, if you\u2019re in a good partnership in marriage, you should be looking at problems like unfinished dishes as a problem for both of you to solve. When you pin yourself against your partner, the foundation starts to crack. You\u2019ve been married for a while, maybe it\u2019s time to reassess the way things have always been done. Just because it\u2019s \u201calways been this way\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t change. Swap a chore for a chore, perhaps. \n\nAny spouse who swore at me and use the word bullshit would be immediately divorced in my book, but that\u2019s a different topic for a different day.\n\nYet again, I really hope this is a fake post as I do with most of these on this sub.", "YTA for the most part, but ESH as well because what married people need to hold each other accountable for doing things via written contract?", "I know many couples and family has good experience with having specific chores for each other.

Don't take your wife to court over a contract about your chores, try some compassion, she seems overwhelmed.\n\nSecondly, the chores you do are not even daily, hers are, plus deep cleaning takes a lot of time. You don't even list a lot of the main tasks like cooking, childcare and laundry. Like many here I suspect she does the lion's share of those, which might explain why she is overwhelmed. \n\nIf you function in a way that you need your responsibilities clearly cut out and written down, seriously reconsider the list/'contract' and find a fairer distribution. But also please try to approach the issue from a more flexible point of view. In a partnership you are there to support each other, and that principle at least temporarily overrides the individual clauses of your contract when one partner is obviously struggling.

Not two years after that agreement, I started taking on all of the kitchen cleaning, bathroom cleaning... heck, the whole house cleaning. Why would I do this if there was an agreement between my wife and I? **Because marriage isn't a business transaction and there is no room for written agreements about chores**. I do it because, honestly, it doesn't take that much energy or time, and I enjoy doing things to make her life easier because it's a solid relationship based on trust, compromise, and empathy.   \nIf written agreements are so important to you, then get a divorce and write up a new agreement with her based on being roommates.", "YTA.

Would you do them if she fell ill? \n\nI personally don't believe in having a chore contract because it doesn't make room for burnout & depression, illness & fatigue, bad days. But if you must have an agreement, make sure its equitable to begin with. If she's doing deep cleaning and daily dishes, I'd like to see where you have regularly strenuous/taxing jobs in your column. Because that right there is a LOT. You may have seasonally taxing jobs, but when those aren't relevant, such as during the Winter, why would you just step back and expect to be served? Give 100%.

I mean he must be Sheldon with every little detail on the contract right", "The list sounds like it\u2019s written by a 10 year old who\u2019s asked to list what adults do. \u201cUh, I dunno- mow the lawn? Charge my iPad? Oh and I see my mom fluffing pillows sometimes\u201d.", "Totally. I was thinking that it sounds more like my situation in uni residence than a marriage. And even my roommates and I spoke to each other more respectfully!", "I rolled my eyes at deep cleaning... OP means she does all of the sweeping, vacuuming, carpet shampooing, picking up kids toys, kids throw up, kids spilling yuck on the floor, taking care of kids when they are sick, getting kids to school and day care, wiping down counter tops, cupboard fronts, cleaning the bathroom, scrubbing the toilet, doing the laundry, hanging laundry out to dry if applicable, folding laundry, grocery shopping, meal planning, cooking, doing ALL of the dishes after cooking, washing windows, cleaning baseboards, fighting the pesky corner cobwebs, watering plants, if they have a dog she's de-furring the couch, the kids clothes, the dryer lint trap, cleaning off muddy dog paws, doing extra sweeping and mopping.\n\nI have a fairly decent sized yard. We pick up dog poop and mow once a week. It literally takes two/three hours out of the weekend. The garden I tend to everyday in the summer takes roughly 30 minutes a day, but most of that is watching bees and butterflies and picking veggies, it's peaceful, not a chore. It's winter, we shovel the sidewalks on our corner lot. It takes 20 mins, 35 minutes if we go ahead and get the neighbors sidewalks too. There is no way these chore lists are fair.", "Yup bins are 5 minutes once a day, yard work is once a week/fortnight. He got the way better deal. It seems like she's gone on strike because of not being appreciated. How much does everyone work? Looking after twin 5 year olds also counts.", "Almost missed the sarcasm. \ud83d\ude02", "That youtube skit about the \"magic coffee table\" comes to mind.", "I mean deep cleaning is not the same level as pillow fluffing? (Maybe the same as yard work?) but the list of assigned chores seems weird,", "Like \"charge the iPad\"... hahaha! He has no clue what she does. That's apparent.", "Weekly and seasonal. I don't know where they are but I'm betting he doesn't do yardwork in the winter, or mow when it raining, which depending on where you are it can do for months at a time.", "Lmao do you mow the lawn three times a day bc that\u2019s how often I do dishes", "You seem reeeaaally invested in this comment section, bro. \n\nIn the end, the division of labor is not equal. Mowing the yawn, yard work, and trash are not usually daily chores. Dishes alone are NEVER ending, especially with two kids in the house. He\u2019s treating his wife like a misbehaving teen instead of a partner who sounds like might be depressed and overwhelmed, and instead of having a conversation about it like an adult, he\u2019s pointing at a piece of paper like a child throwing a tantrum. In the end, this screams they need counseling.", "It was never about the Iranian yogurt", "verbal chore assignments/chore chart is different from a written contract that ends up in screaming at each other. saying the dishes is her job no matter what is just absurd", "But we know she fluffs the pillows!!", "As a mother who stopped doing the dishes myself in the past, I feel like I can make a decent guess \ud83e\udd23 Now it's one person cooks, one person cleans up after and it's lovely.", "You nailed some big ones that were omitted! \n\nNot to mention- deep cleaning after 5 year old twins.\ud83d\ude33 \n\nI'm guessing she's tossing the ball to him on dishes because his main job is mowing the grass and it's winter. Unless he's on snow shovel duty which could even out depending on location.", "Right? Trying to minimize everything that entails for sure", "Yeah, and it takes like 10 minutes tops. Doing them a few times despite an agreement is maybe annoying, but it's far less annoying than starting a huge fight over it because of a piece of paper that doesn't even mean anything other than the honor code.\n\nPeople really need to learn that sometimes there's more important things than being right.", "My partner and I are both mentally ill fools. Shit piles up on us sometimes and most of the time it's me who has to bring it all back together. I don't mind because I love my partner. I don't understand how people live differently but that's also part of life I guess ...", "Obviously but the amazing part is the delusional individual who believes they are actually in the right about this. \n\nOP may never see this comment but if he does... Bruh divorces have happened over less stupid shit. Dishes fuckin suck for everyone that's why everyone hates em. Throw a podcast on and grit your teeth. Be happy you aren't some child slave in China forced to hit 1000 disposable ELF vape pens.", "According to the OP, yes, yes it is.", "But he picks up toys in the yard!  You just can't get those five minutes back, you know.", "Assuming this isn't directed at me since I'm not the OP", "Hit the little dots there by the arrow at the bottom of your comment. It should bring up a menu with an edit option.", "No. But ignoring her refusal  to do her part for the household by just doing it all himself and not addressing the problems will begin the slippery slope. That\u2019s kinda exactly the point I made. It\u2019s all there, you don\u2019t even need to read between the lines", "Found OPs alt account", "Not so much.  There are plenty of us men that are or have been in the OP's situation. Men that spent a lot of time trying to do their part and more only to get very little help because their wives have every excuse under the sun to not pitch in. We get caught doing it all. Then we get call names by merely suggesting that our wives or girlfriends help out around the house. Names like...well like psychotic. It isn't psychotic to expect your spouse to hold up her end of an agreement. That is unless you're a man on Reddit suggesting a women pick up a broom and lend a hand around the house once in a while.", "It looks pretty equal to me. The OP states that there are other chores that vary. Nowhere does he say that she is the primary caretaker of the kids. That could very well be something that varies. You're assuming. Either way it is irrelevant because she agreed to the division of labor. She isn't doing the part she agreed to do. If the genders were reversed  almost everyone would be on her side. Hell most everyone is on her side anyway.", "No she wouldn't She would have a whole boat load of \"You go girl\" \"Slay\" and \"Yass Queens\". Being a man has *everything* to do with it. She agreed to the division of labor. Plus the OP states the her not doing the dishes is the latest in a trend of being an asshole to him and the kids. He sounds like he has had enough and isn't going to take any more of her BS.", "But they didn\u2019t try to encompass everything. He clearly says that other tasks vary. They split up the most important tasks in a way that initially seemed to make sense to both of them, as they both agreed to it. Remember, this is only the result of initially fighting about fairness when it came to doing tasks. Your way of splitting tasks up informally obviously doesn\u2019t work in this household, so they resorted to this.", "Fluffing pillows..like c\u2019mon man\u2026do better.", "Making the bed is also just once daily and i would argue takes fair less time than doing dishes for four. Doing dishes is at least twice daily - break and dinner.\n\nAlso, what OP doesnt mention is who cooks.", "Idk maybe he sweeps the kitchen (hardwood floor) she sweep the bed room (carpeted). \n\nThat's just a guess because like you i don't know these people so I'm not sure why you think I would know", "I bet this dude couldn't name even half of the tasks that actually go in to deep cleaning a room. I swear there's chores that men like this go their entire lives never realising get done on a daily or weekly basis to keep their homes in shape.", "No, it doesn't. Maid service deep cleanings (every other week) typically takes one person 4 hours or 2 people 2 hours for a 4 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom house. It looks amazing when they are done. They may know the tricks of the trade, but there's no way anyone should take all day to clean one room if it is not cluttered, or a few hours to clean a bathroom so it shines. A master bathroom with a separate shower and tub, 2 sinks, and tile flooring takes about an hour.", "I\u2019m guessing some more than others but that in itself is still a full work day.", ">We have agreed to do certain chores and if one of us doesn't uphold the contract, the other doesn't do the other person's job. I even have a written agreement on that since we constantly get into arguments about this.\n\nI think it's 7 on average", "Right, I know it is way more than seven.", "It\u2019s 7 that the husbands create themselves. So on top of the time cleaning after themselves and kids and pets.", "I found an [article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-housework-husbands/husbands-create-7-hours-of-extra-housework-a-week-study-idUSN0441782220080404) referencing it, it appears to be a 15 year U of Michigan study. I\u2019d be interested in an update as well.", "Don\u2019t choose shitty people", "You hoover daily?  WHAAAAT? We do this once a week.  Why do you need to vacuum more?", "Lol I actually agree. I think they need a chore wheel. They can spin it every day and let the wheel decide their fate.", "Dude is leaving out a lot of stuff on purpose hoping we don\u2019t notice how ridiculously unfair the workload has been split.\n\nSpoiler alert: We noticed.", "Right?  Like come on dude, fluffing pillows and charging ipads aren't \"chores\" they're like 30 second things you do as you're doing other stuff.  Of all the chores I can think of, charging my damn phone wouldn't even come up.\n\nThe fact that he is listing those as chores means he doesn't even understand what a chore even is.  I bet the wife is doing 2-3x the work he is, and he is trying to make it sound like she does nothing, meanwhile he is talking about/to her like a damn child...", "I mean, if it helps them to keep track of stuff to distribute chores more fairly than in the average hetero relationship, I guess they should go for it. It doesn't even sound like OP even remotely took over 50% of the chores in that contract, and a lot of chores are left open, which kind of defeats the purpose. Also, the way OP goes about enforcing it in full escalation mode instead of being a partner is awful.", "Sadly, I think that he's more concerned about not doing dished than his wife's wellbeing", "I\u2019m sensing OP may have an alt account", "THANK YOU!", "i stand by this post as fake\u2026 fluffing the pillows, what the actual fuck.", "Right. Hope OP isn't too exhausted from mowing the lawn in the dead of winter. Brutal", "Building off of your comment, my bad!", "Thank you. Much appreciated. I made it work.", "But the 'contract' system is actively breaking down, so now what?\n\nWill they require a written contract that one of them gets to point to each time they have a disagreement?\n\nHow old do the kids need to be before they each get their own contracts?", "I think we need a picture of that written agreement. If fluffing pillows is on there, I\u2019ll eat my shoe.", "Bet he uses windex on everything and doesn\u2019t even know the cleaners specific to the appliances (stainless steel), the glass stove top, and the tile back splash even exist let alone where they are, how/where to use them, etc. and actively destroys the surfaces and areas he does claim to clean.", "With kids and animals, vacuuming daily is a necessity.", "2 Kids and 2 cats, I fully blame them lol admittedly some days it\u2019s only certain rooms I do but yeah there\u2019s rarely a day I can go without getting the hoover out at all", "i vacuum daily and we only have one dog. once a week and our house would be an absolutely filthy disaster.", "Kids create chaos daily. So the hoover runs daily. Sometimes twice for extra chaos.", "I don\u2019t even bother with weekly\u2026 it waits for the house cleaner every two weeks. As the wife in this situation whose spouse barely ever helps I quit. The house literally gets cleaned every two weeks-sheets, sweeping, toilets-i don\u2019t care. We do the same job same # of hours and I am not going to spend my free time cleaning. We all pick up our stuff, I mostly cook and he occasionally does and he occasionally does dishes. I just dont care anymore.", "And charging iPads?? How tf is that on a list of chores?", "I never said that the contract system isn\u2019t working for them. I said it wasn\u2019t inherently wrong. And at least it seems to be working for one party. Splitting tasks up and having them documented are good for reference and good for accountability. My family has done this before as well.", "I don\u2019t have kids nor animals and vacuum daily, at least once per day. I only have a carpet in one room though, and I notice things easier on wooden floors or kitchen floors.", "hahaha right. what is going on in that house", "I also agree that the making of the contract entails an established agreement that certain tasks should be done by said person. However, if something was to come up, it should be discussed and open to change. Personally, I\u2019m on the concept that if you dirty a dish, you clean it. That\u2019s what I do, and my partner respects that. Similarly, if you make a mess, you clean it. If you leave trash on the couch, floor, tabletop, etc, DUH. You throw it away. Literally just take responsibility for YOUR messes, and there can\u2019t possibly be a reasonable argument against that. Things like vacuuming and cleaning the bathroom though should be split, since those are things everyone is responsible for"]}
