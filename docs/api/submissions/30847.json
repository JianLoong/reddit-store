The owner (young woman, I'm guessing around 28) gets so pissed and in the rudest voice I have ever heard says \"aren't you going to ask first?\" I got so embarrassed and walked back and apologized profusely, but she just continues, \"that's kind of an asshole move, it's only polite to ask first\". I continue to apologize, and move back behind my friend, because I am very bad with confrontation, and the woman says if we don't leave she'll report me for animal abuse, but then my coffee comes so we leave.

If the dog owner didn't intervene when it approached you and started licking, then she had no right being a turd when you pet it.\n\nThis sounds like those assholes who take their dog to dog parks where their little shit gets aggressive with your dog, but Lord help you if you stick up for your dog and touch theirs.", "NTA. If she is going to be such a stickler about people asking for permission before petting the dog, then she needs to make sure she keeps the dog under control so that the dog does not touch other people without their their permission first - after all you never know what people are afraid of dogs. And if the dog came up to you and was biting you, then it was not properly trained.", "NTA. Her dog was interacting with you first, she didnt stop it or pay attention. Yes you should ask, always, as i am assuming you just learned the hard way. You kbow it wasnt animal abuse so she would have likely been lectured about misusing law enforcement.", "NTA - Some people can never take accountability for their actions. Yes u touched her dog without consent but she is the one who let the dog literally get right up to u and lick u. If she wasn\u2019t comfortable with u doing that then she shouldn\u2019t have allowed the dog to approach u. Don\u2019t think too much of people like that.", "Did she ask your permission for her dog to lick your leg?

You're fine.", "Ha, I would have told her that you also prefer being asked before nibbled! NTA\n\nIt is polite, but her dog broke the ice with the licks.", "NTA. Wtf?? That\u2019s an aggressive reaction. She was absolutely the asshole for her reaction. She sounds almost unstable with her threat to report you. At best, she should have been more engaged with her pup when he approached you with licking and play biting. Also at best she could\u2019ve just given a gentle caution about asking and not had an entire aggressive reaction. \nI\u2019ve given gentle reminders about consent with dogs, and always best to leave alone if no person is around. You never know what could happen.", "NTA - yes you should ask before approaching and petting a dog, but if the owner has let it interact with you already (even if it\u2019s just because they aren\u2019t paying attention) petting it is reasonable. \n\nIt sounds to me like this woman saw an opportunity to talk down to someone and used it to treat you rudely. Probably just someone who has little control over things in their life and wanted an easy win by being mean to a kid.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't watching her dog, who was licking your leg and biting you. If that was my daughter, it would have meant an allergic reaction as she breaks out in bad hives if a dog licks her (we had to go to the ER once for it). \n\nI'm sorry she was acting this way to a teenage girl, you did NOTHING wrong.", "I say NTA. The dog was already expressing their friendly disposition, so petting them was fine imo. The dog\u2019s owner however overreacted and crossed the AH line by continuing to verbally attack you after you apologized and threatening to falsely report you for animal abuse to local authorities. Next time just ask for top cover before petting a dog.", "NTA man. you should probably ask to pet a dog next time in case they have issues, but this lady literally let het dog lick and bite you tf? and screaming at a 13 year old for petting your dog is also completely unhinged, what a strange creature", "NTA. This dog owner is clearly a massive AH, but I'd suggest you take this as a lesson learned. Asking whether you can pet someone else's pet is a good courtesy and serves as a risk control; you never know how dogs react to strangers even if they appear friendly and want attention. \n\nYou could have let this AH dog owner know that her doggie didn't ask your permission to lick you...yeah I'm petty.", "Nta", "......\n\nWhat an unhinged, massive escalation from -dog, licking your leg-\n\n-you, petting the dog-\n\n-owner of dog, shrieking like a banshiee- \"i deserve respect, ask permission, or im going to report you...  for...  on my own dog...  that licked you first\"....\n\nNTA, obviously", "fun fact: petting an animal is not animal abuse. obviously the dog wanted to be petted.

Why don\u2019t we call the Police and see what they have to say about THAT!\n\nIt is a dog owners RESPONSIBILITY to have COMPLETE CONTROL over their dog AT ALL TIMES so the dog should have been nowhere NEAR you or close enough to LICK you/nip you.\n\nI know you hate confrontation.

While the owner started yelling louder that his dog was scared.  I looked at his dog and then at him and said \"Seriously?.\".

I would have turned around and said you didn't ask if your dog can lick and nibble my leg so I don't need your permission to touch your dog.
