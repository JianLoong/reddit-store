OP was responsible for her own siblings and decided to get food using her own money to treat her siblings.\n\nThe other ADULT cousins wanted to do the same before they realised they didn\u2019t have enough money to get their younger siblings the same food. That\u2019s not OPs fault. Sure OP could have then told her siblings no and all gone somewhere else to eat together that was less expensive, or not eaten at all, but there\u2019s also no reason why the group couldn\u2019t split up for lunch when OP had already told her younger siblings they could have the special sandwiches. There\u2019s no reason why the whole group needed to eat together just because they had set out for a walk together.", "NTA\n\nI don't know why everyone keeps reading this story and thinking you weren't using your own money to pay for your siblings.\n\nOP had their own money only and was using it to pay for their own siblings. OP was also not in charge of taking care of their cousins and was not the only adult there. \n\nALSO their cousins had enough money to pay for food for everyone JUST NOT the special food.\n\nAgain, NTA you had only enough for you and your siblings and tried to give them something nice while the others couldn't and are jealous that's it.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be expected to pay for your cousins?  One was older than you.  I don't get why extended family feels entitled to your money.", "NTA not your mouths to feed", "NTA cause as I can see you were in charge of yourself and your siblings. The older cousins were in charge of the younger cousins. You all were checking out the city on your last day.\n\nYoung ones get hungry and you have enough of your own money to go get your siblings the expensive sandwiches. While the cousins did not have enough to get sandwiches there. You could be nice and choose to spread out your money that everybody gets a regular sandwich. But that is not your obligation.\n\nSucks for the cousins but they can find a cheaper resturant then you guys could meet up. They could return home to get food then go back out.", "NTA, what you buy for you and your own isn\u2019t up to them, not everyone is going to be able to eat what others are every time they go out, it\u2019s a fact of life they won\u2019t always be able to afford what others can", "NTA. It would have been nice if you and the other adult cousins had made sure you could afford the expensive lunch before you agreed to pay for everyone, but it was an honest mistake.\n\nThe way I see it the adult cousins were responsible for their younger siblings, including paying for their lunch when you decided to go to a restaurant, and they didn't have enough money for even the basic sandwiches without you helping. They told their kid siblings they were taking them to lunch and then called you an AH for not picking up the check for them.\n\nThere might have been a better way to handle this; maybe splitting a few of the fancy sandwiches for the experience and then eating something at your grandparents house if anyone was still hungry. BUT not thinking of the best possible compromise doesn't make you the AH; you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI grew up really poor and had plenty of these experiences. It was always embarrassing for me to go to restaurants with other people because I/we probably could only afford the cheapest things on the menu with no extras at all. I remember having an actual anxiety attack at 16 when I'd spend the day with a friend and, when we were deciding what to do for the rest of the evening, he asked what was for dinner at my house. It was bad enough that I developed an eating disorder in highschool because I was too ashamed to sign up for free lunches and eventually it spiralled into just not eating for days if I didn't have a reason to sit down and share a meal with someone.\n\nI feel for these kids. Itwas humiliating and painful and I never once took it out on the people who could afford to buy food.", "NTA", "NTA Siblings>Cousins", "NTA\n\nYou had limited funds and you wanted your siblings to have that special sandwich\n\nWhere you could have done better as an adult is to agree the two adults would not eat the special sandwich or any, pool your money left and get regular sandwiches for everyone else to split between them, maybe they would have had half a regular sandwich but the kids would eat\n\nAnother option would have been to gone home, see if their family wanted to buy their kids that sandwich and if not they could have eaten there and you could have gone back with your siblings, if it wasn't miles away\n\nThe 24 year old should not speak poorly if you for not getting him a sandwich but the young kids don't understand", "It never dawned on anyone in that entire group that you could have purchased a couple of special sandwiches, split them so everyone could try it and also purchased less expensive ones, split those and everyone would have a full meal??\n\nNot one of you?\n\nNAH but wth?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was basically shoving it in the face of the other little kids.  That's really cruel.  These weren't adults who could understand.    \n\n\nThe thing to do would have been something like:   \n\n\n \"let's get a few special sandwiches to share, then get enough of the not special sandwiches so everyone has enough to eat.  That way everyone has a taste of the special sandwiches.\"  OR...  \n\n\n\"let's just get the plain sandwiches for now, then we can come back another time (for your siblings) to get the special sandwiches).", "As you get older and wiser, you'll realize that it would have been more important to make sure everyone was included and fed, rather than getting \"special\" sandwiches for a select few. It could have been a really nice memory of everyone getting a sandwich that the family would have remembered fondly in years to come. I'm going to stop short of saying YTA because when I was 23, I don't know if I would have made the right decision either after being pressured by my siblings and being excited about something \"special\". Maybe you can take this as a lesson moving forward and do better next time. An apology to the cousins and a promise to get sandwiches at the next gathering would be a nice start to mending the rift.", "I'm sorry, but not feeding a little kid in order to get \"special\" sandwiches for other kids is a jerk move. When you are the adults in charge if a group of kids, you have to feed all of them if you are feeding them. Buying \"special\" sandwiches for only two and leaving the rest hungry makes YTA.", "I'm going to say a soft YTA because it is rude when you're in a group to leave people without food when you're eating.

You could have gotten 'special sandwiches' a different time.", "YTA for getting food in front of other people in your group that couldn't afford to buy any food.

I understand why only you guys got one but this wasn't the time for it.", "INFO\n\nSo this wasn't your money, but money given to you to get food for everyone?\n\nIf so YTA.

I have a lot of cousins. I don\u2019t think it was your responsibility to purchase sandwiches for all of these people. (Could they not walk back to the parents and ask for money/food? \n\nI would have also bought the sandwiches for my sisters and I. However, it seems you pooled your money together to get everyone food. Getting everyone\u2019s hopes up.
