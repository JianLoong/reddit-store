AITA if I refuse contact?\nEdit: she really turned on me when she wanted to make a trust for my kids and BIL and there were some issues with practicality of the other trustee being the other side of the world which we raised  concerns about because BIL is also an adult.  To be clear this isn\u2019t about money in any way because we\u2019re financially secure and it was for this reason she implied I couldn\u2019t be trusted to have any involvement in something related to my kids when in reality I wanted to protect all parties especially BIL", "created_utc": 1700145253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wobzn/aita_mil_blocked_us_now_pretends_like_nothing/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I personally would do it in a public place (like coffee shop or such) to keep all the emotions in check (e.g. \\*most\\* people tend to remain calmer in conversations when in public).", "NTA She isn\u2019t going to work on her issues. Take care of yourself and your family!!", "NTA. your MIL sounds like a narcissist and will just keep doing the same shit over and over again.\n\nBet you once you refuse contacting her she will try to gaslight you making you look like you're taking away her precious grandkids.", "NTA...In the very least, MIL needs to apologize.  Otherwise it doesn't seem that she has much to offer your children as a role model or grandmother.", "NTA. Go no contact and enjoy your peace.", "If what you're saying is all true, NTA. Keep that toxic woman out of your life. Nothing good can come from trying to relate with her.", "NTA if she hasn't changed or recognized her toxicity by not, it's never going to happen.  Your spouse shouldn't want to push a relationship that is toxic at best.  You can bet she would use those opportunities to disparage you and your husband.  Nope... hold to your boundaries.  She's had more than enough chances.", "NTA\n\nId protect your children from this woman. She sounds cruel and more damaging than adding anything of benefit to your lives.", "Refuse contact until she has been in therapy for a long time. \n\nNTA  You need to protect your children, my Grandmother favored my cousins. My siblings had a really hard time with the treatment and it has caused many issues within the family over the years. I got to the point I didn't care for my Grandmother and just ignored her whenever she was around. I resented the times my family would want me to deal with her mistreatment. My siblings and I refused to go to Christmas and watch everything our cousins got. Grams wanted us to be an audience to our cousin Christmas.", "NTA.  Your MIL-from-hell sounds like a cruel woman.  You and your husband together need to talk to her about re-establishing a relationship with your family on YOUR terms.  This may be a difficult conversation to have, but it is important that you two let her know your boundaries that you will insist be respected OR an ongoing relationship cannot be.  These are YOUR children and you are showing them how a family should behave.  If your MIL cannot be loving and supportive, as you want to be towards her, and NOT critical and unkind of any of you in your immediate family, then contact cannot be.  You need to teach her how you will be treated.  It's that simple but you have to clearly communicate your terms.  Hope you can work it out for the betterment of everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One approach is that you and your husband establish the boundaries before you reopen contact, for example:\n\n* No derogatory comments or complaints about you and your husband\n* Controlled contact with your children for a limited period during a day to start\n* Not coming over to your house but meeting somewhere else", "We tried having a discussion with her and my husband was telling her about all the incredibly stressful things going on in our lives but her only response was what about me to every single thing he said.  She lives in another country so having an actual sit down is difficult.  I ended up allowing her to visit for the sake of the kids but keeping my distance but that just pissed her off even more before she blocked us", "She already did that \ud83e\udd23 cos I hadn\u2019t been directly sending her updates and photos of the kids(which she could see on Facebook) she accused me of putting her on a restricted profile not letting her see anything", "She apologized then later only said she apologized because we wanted her to and she hadn\u2019t actually done anything wrong", "It\u2019s 100% true and only the tip of the iceberg", "Yep she already did that in her last message to him before she blocked him.  Wow people are really nailing what she\u2019ll do in the comments", "I grew up in a similar situation and my parents were no contact with one of my grandmothers for most of my life so that\u2019s probably why I\u2019ve tried so hard to just remove myself and leave contact with the kids but then her cutting contact was just the final straw", "She likes to portray herself as this ditzy woman as an excuse for the things she says when she\u2019s fully aware because I\u2019ve said many times over the years that things she says to my husband isn\u2019t right but she\u2019d just continue doing it.  My husband was getting migraines and needed a brain scan and he told her and she just said she didn\u2019t want to hear any more about hospitals.  Literally ever moment we\u2019ve tried to be happy for the kids after all the grief she\u2019s put a downer on it like we\u2019re not allowed be happy", "I don't blame you for going LC / NC with your MIL, I would also (went NC with my own mother for 25 years).  I would be asking your husband is this really what he wants your children to be exposed to and learn from your MIL.  Children are smart and will pick up on most anything.\n\nAs far as Social Media, I personally would call her out on any shenanigans she pulls (like with your comment about her being in a restrictive profile).  Let her side of the family see that she is not restricted and remind everyone that she was called out and it was SHE who blocked YOU.", "I don\u2019t get why your husband would want your kids to have relationships with someone who treats others so poorly?", "Then, that's not really an apology.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just realized that I sound like mother. Eek.", "My husband very quiet and struggles with confrontation and he\u2019s one those just genuinely good people which is part of the reason I want nothing to do with her.  It was very difficult watching her constantly make him suffer more while he was already grieving", "He\u2019s just a really good guy and the kids don\u2019t actually know about anything because we\u2019ve kept them removed from it all. They\u2019ve already lost 2 grandparents and I think he also feels guilty about them also not having her around. She wasn\u2019t always this extreme either", "The issue now is if she does apologize is it just worthless because how do we know she\u2019s actually heard us and is genuinely apologetic", "I bet that was horrible, sorry you and your husband had to go through that.\n\nI agree with you, I would definitely go No Contact for the foreseeable future as any contact with the children just seems like it would hurt them emotionally rather than be a positive influence.", "I see\u2026the way I look at it would be in what\u2019s in the best interest of the kids and this toxicity isn\u2019t it", "Iv kept things from the kids as much as possible because I\u2019m a strong believer in adult problems not effecting kids.  My biggest hard line is you don\u2019t mess with kids events.  Everyone in the family knows this and even the people that despise each other don\u2019t say a word on that day and get along for their sake", "That is also my opinion, I think she needs some sort of professional help and leaning on my husband wasn\u2019t healthy but she reacted very badly at the mention of seeking help so I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll happen", "NTA block her yourself. She can't be trusted and why would you subject you and your family to her awful self. She is the one who burned the bridge. Fuck her.", "NTA\nShe sounds like a nightmare and I wouldn't want her around my family either. Why husband would want this woman around his kids after how badly she treats him is beyond me. I can only imagine what she would say to them. Nah son, she gotta go.", "NTA. But don\u2019t get involved in a tit for tat on social media.  It is childish and undignified.", "One thing to consider.   You stated your MIL's behavior changed after FIL died.    Her behavior sounds extremely narcissistic.   If that is true, I would suggest you're fighting a losing battle.  A narcissist has no empathy and everything has to be their way or the highway.   Guard your kids against this kind of behavior.   Sometimes it's just not worth it to plow through the games.", "NTA\n\nRefusing to engage someone who has insulted you and not acknowledge what she did or apologized for it is the most reasonable thing you can do.\n\nTell your husband he can do what he wants, but you and the kids aren't available for her to abuse.  If he tries to pressure you about the kids, help him understand that his mother is not kind or stable, and that he and his wife and children are her favourite targets, that you do not trust her with your children, and you do not trust him to be able to see her abuse because she raised him to think it is normal.  Suggest if this is so important to him, that perhaps you can find a qualified third party to get involved, perhaps to even help supervise visits with her because you are done.", "NTA.", "He\u2019s got Asperger\u2019s and he\u2019s always been quiet and wouldn\u2019t speak his mind so I generally would. She also moved countries when he was 17 so for the most part visits were fairly limited.  I think he still lives in hope that she\u2019ll actually listen and get help", "We don\u2019t, we were accused of it but we never restricted/blocked access to ours.", "He\u2019d like her to have contact with them but he 100% understands her behavior just isn\u2019t acceptable and he\u2019s not forcing it.  He\u2019s been ignoring her completely until he decides exactly what it is he wants to say to her.", "Lol this whole thing could have been written by my poor SIL about my mother (who is a very unpleasant person, for the record). It took SIL a long time to get through to my sibling about the fact that our mother was behaving terribly, but my sibling was so used to it that he just thought it was normal to be treated like garbage by his mother. If you can't persuade your husband to cut her out, I would look up the DEEP method (don't defend, engage, explain, or personalise) for interactions like this. It sounds as though you spent a lot of time trying to appeal to your MIL's empathy, but she doesn't have any for anyone other than herself. You'll need to take a different approach when you talk to her compared to talking with a regular person.", "She\u2019s very very good at playing the victim with everything.  She always was even before my FIL passed, which don\u2019t get me wrong was horrific but we chose to try to find the happiness in life and to make everything as fun and special for our kids as we can.  She seems to find a way to make everything depressing, an example was Father\u2019s Day, my husband wanted his dads rings that he always wore around his neck but she said she couldn\u2019t find them and then conveniently found them that day which was obviously upsetting for my husband.  Or last Christmas she sent money for the kids so we took them to build a bear with it before Xmas which we told her about and then on Xmas morning started having a go at us on the phone"]}
