The person who took first was really bent out of shape.  Unfortunately for his kids his children\u2019s share was split 3 ways instead of 2 so he could get at least something.  They saw it as Dad got part of theirs.  Not surprisingly.", "exactly. NTA your sister views you as an ATM and nothing else. it's one thing to lend money if a family member is in trouble but just 'because'? no. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntell her the free ride is over.", "Yeah, Sis doesn't need to get a second job to get the luxuries she wants, OP is sis's extra job--she's been worked over anyway.", "Not even that. It's OP's money. If they want to have an expensive firepit, and burn the cash, that's more warmth and use than giving the money to OP's sister.", "That's what gets me. Her reasoning is, gimme money, I want it.\n\nAlso, I wonder how OP's husband feels about her giving her sister money over the years. My husband would be OK with me helping my siblings out but \"give me money but I'm not telling you what for, how dare you ask me?\" would absolutely not fly. With either of us.\n\n\"It's your fault, I see nice stuff so I demand money from you\" is a hell of a case of entitlement.\n\nMy siblings both make a lot more than I do. My sister has a gorgeous house. My brother paid off his house years ago and he and his wife are always traveling. Never in a million years would I look at that and go, \"Gimme.\"", "This is what I would do - tally up all the money they\u2019ve given the sister. Perhaps ask what they used it for.", "Alternatively/additionally \u201cyou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t need it. But my kids do, so they have fewer struggles than we did.\u201d", "And why didn t the sister go to school as OP did?", "\"Big Empty House\".  Next up is that OP doesn't need this much space so sister and her husband will be moving in and contributing nothing.", "For a lot of people, there is no difference between \"setting boundaries\" and \"burning the bridge\".  Most people I know, you can't set any boundaries with them.  You can only burn the bridges or keep your distance enough that they never see you in the first place.", "> I knew something was wrong!\n\nMost likely that all of his options either had dead batteries due to a bad/no trickle charger or were in the shop for a timing chain replacement, based on selection of vehicles you mention lol.", "Naw, working with a lot of people in the medical field their student loans are crazy. \n\nI would say most Dr won\u2019t beable to afford a nice car(100k+) for 5-6 years unless they\u2019re wanting the extra debt. \n\nOne office I made custom screws for said he had almost 490k in student loans at 8% and 12%.. I don\u2019t think he will ever pay that off with minimum payments.", "The doctors being judged on the value of their cars?", "If it's not America, you made it up.", "LOL, that would explain it. I drove a beat up 99 Honda for most of my early career, and only recently 'traded up' into a 2018 Prius. None of my patients ever had an issue. But I'm family medicine, so no one expects me to be fancy anyway.", "Plus a couple kids. So when sister says \u201cit\u2019s not like you need it,\u201d she definitely does!", "This was my confusion. Marine biology is one of those jobs, like veterinarian, that all the kids want to be. Then they take a life planning unit in ninth grade.and try to budget with that salary, most switch to something else. I honestly would have assumed a hairstylist made more.\n\nThe two of them probably make less than 130k, if in the US, and that isn't enough to buy a big home in a decent  school district on the coast unless they  are really stretching it.", "Yeah my friend is marine biologist and he has 3 roommates as he only finished his phd quite recently at age almost 30. Rolling in the dough, he is not.", "Well coming from a \u201cdirt poor\u201d background, I\u2019d say some might think that is awesome.", "Hairdressers often make minimum wage and tips.  Anyway, you can take the person out of poverty, but you can never take the poverty out of the person.  They'll always have trauma around money and will never be able to stop being jealous and erratic.  This same mentality will mean nobody in this story is going to go to therapy, since that's money that would be better spent on fancy stuff they couldn't get as kids, or squirreled away for a rainy day.\n\nThe reason I have such a low opinion of poor people (including formerly poor people) is because I am a dirty poor and most people I know are also dirt poor.  I know how poor people are on average.", "Yes, exactly.  \"We helped you survive, so now it's your responsibility to save us from poverty since you were able to save yourself.\"", "what a kick in the teeth, eh? but better to know and have that person out of  your life, even though it may hurt.", "Can you imagine OP's sister asking OP for money, and OP just casually pulls out a Benjamin and lights it on fire in front of her.\n\n\"No.\"", "Sis pisses away her money, and now she wants to piss away yours, too. \"How dare you spend money you earned on somebody other than me!\"", "I have a sibling who is many times over more well off than me. When I was first divorced, drowning in medical bills, and on the verge of homeless it never occurred to me to ask for straight up cash. I did ask for help buying food. They gladly helped. I asked for help growing my private tutoring business. They obliged. They also helped by \u201chiring\u201d my kids to do stuff around their house at inflated prices. Who knew picking up dog poop in a small yard for a half hour was worth $50?\ud83e\udd23 And that was in the early 2000\u2019s so it really was a lot of money, but they did it so the kids had some pocket money and could also save for big things I flat out couldn\u2019t afford, like bikes. I\u2019m also convinced that they\u2019re one of the reasons my kids are now adults who are generally good with money. My BIL would sit them down and plan out how much they needed for what they wanted and helped them set up a work/spend/save plan. It didn\u2019t take long for me to get back on my feet, and I\u2019m forever grateful to my sister and BIL. I would never have dreamed of just asking for money just because.", "Absolutely the correct mindset to have. It's fine to help people out in a pinch, but I don't understand the constant asking when it's not really that hard to live within your limits if both partners are making a respectable income. It's called not feeling entitled to extras you can't afford. Allow yourself to save on some extras and make smaller things matter more. It doesn't seem like the sister is struggling. Just that she wants more more more.", "Because she\u2019s lazy and now wants handouts she \u201cobviously \u201c deserves.", "There is literally no information about OPs mother other than she died young. Don\u2019t presume.", "\"I assure you, this dead person that I don't know and am going to gloss over the fact that I didn't realize was dead, would have been shitty.\"", "These people might as well be left on the side of the road. Because these are the people who work by the motto \"my way or the highway\". Well, good travels, dear ;)", "Out of curiosity, which part do you think is somehow exclusive to the US, and why?", "It is absolutely awesome money that still goes a long way, but as of this year it\u2019s literally the US median worker salary. You almost definitionally cannot flaunt the median level of income unless you are living well beyond your means.", "Right but there\u2019s a difference between sister having trauma around genuine continuing deprivation and resentment of OP\u2019s affluence which is what OP seems to think is happening. And OP having some kind of superiority complex about her job title and education that is exploited by OP\u2019s sister when both are doing somewhere from ok to a little above average. Again, her husband is the missing piece here. If he\u2019s a deadbeat how OP describes things makes sense, but if he\u2019s even an average worker the sister could just be begging money off OP to compete with her for status goods in a context where the difference between their household salaries is like 20K.", "relateable af. I am classic broke uni student living in a one room garage thing at the back of someone\u00b4s property with my partner. I used to have the money, (during COVID and during my last 2 yrs of highschool I worked part-time to nearly full time hours as a cleaner) and managed to save up around 4k. I even had my mum throw off comments about having a lot of money. My sister now, despite being in a position to earn money seems entitled to it and I have always made sure to give and lend money when I can financially afford to help out.", "The culture of poverty is very different from that of normal people.", "A high school girl that worked for me was brilliant and so personable, she was at the top of her class and had the awards to prove it. She lived in poverty with her mom and grandma though. I tried to be a positive influence on her and encouraged her to go to college. She applied and got accepted but her mother became histrionic and eventually admitted that she was afraid she would think she was too good for the rest of the family if she had a college degree. She didn\u2019t go and within a year was a single mom just like the two generations before her.", "Sure, but culture is primarily a mindset. The \"poverty culture\" as you describe it is toxic and prey on people who have made it by using guilt tripping. Because \"since you made it, you have to take care of us forever. We are family, and the only reason you have come this far in the first place is thanks to us. How dare you deny us. You are ungrateful. You think you are too good for us now? blablabla...\". This is based on jealousy, where you're sought out to be taken advantage of.\n\nHealthy \"poverty culture\" should be: I know where you are, I've been there. Ask me for advice and I'll give it to you. Need scholarships? Need funding? Need housing? Need help with food? There you go, that's where you can get it. There are contacts to whom you can reach out for further advice etc. Help does not need to be given in the form of money.", "Yep, the only way to escape poverty is a combination of extreme luck, preternatural talent, and the willingness to sacrifice literally every interpersonal connection you've ever had in the name of your own desires.  This is why people who have escaped poverty are often some of the biggest assholes you'll ever meet.", "Poverty culture is nothing more than a giant crab bucket.  And it stinks like piss, cigarettes, and cheap beer in here."]}
