Perhaps that\u2019s why she decided to use the money she didn\u2019t spend on alterations and instead is focusing on the venue and food, which you as a guest will get to enjoy.", "Umm... please explain to me how exactly the venue and catering are not important parts of the wedding?  Those 100% are priorities.  You need a place to have a wedding and you kind of have to serve people food.  YTA, mostly because you agreed to help, then got all judge-y and decided not to help because you decided that probably if she isn't getting married in a park and serving people pizza then she's doing it wrong.", "Don\u2019t promise gifts if you want to attach strings to it later. Of course YTA.", "you agreed to help her, if you don\u2019t I\u2019m gonna say YTA", "NTA. But everything aside.  Wound you want to pay for her alterations if you didn\u2019t know the rest? If so. And it won\u2019t hurt you. Then go ahead and let that be your wedding gift.", "Pay for it, but make this your wedding gift to her", "Pay for it as her wedding gift.", "> spending thousands of dollars on other parts of the wedding, like the venue and catering. \n\nThat's not unusual. It's not like a venue and food for the guests is a luxury you know!\n\n> My husband\n\nYou actually have experience of getting married yet still posted this?", "NTA, no one is entitled to an expensive wedding. If she can't afford DRESS ALTERATIONS she absolutely should not be spending thousands on once-in-a-lifetime stupidness and should be having a pot luck backyard wedding my lord.", "Tough one, while you suck for backing on a promise, it could be you only agreed thinking they would tone down on all the other expenses.", "You told her you would do it. But that is her gift.", "YTA.  You agreed to pay for the alterations.  You shouldn't renege on that agreement now.  I understand that you don't like that she's spending her money on other parts of the wedding.  Honestly, if I was struggling financially, I'd probably get married at the courthouse and just throw a reception, but that's me.  She is having the big wedding.  Surely you had to realize that venues and catering are expensive these days.  You didn't ask about her budget or how it was allocated, so you don't get to question the decisions she's making.  Just honor your commitment and get more information if someone asks you for financial help in the future.", "NTA she can afford it is is wasting money on other things.", "NTA. She\u2019s clearly trying to take advantage of you. She just so conveniently has money for everything else but alterations? Nah don\u2019t do it.", "YTA. It's cheap and low class to to renege on something like that. you already agreed. it's normal to spend thousands on venue and catering. Weddings are expensive which is why they asked. You are acting like she is buying frivolous luxury items or going on lavish vacations and that's why they need help with the wedding.", "Since you already told her you\u2019d pay for them, pay for it but be sure to give her a budget and if she\u2019s planning to go over that she\u2019ll be responsible for paying for the rest of it!", "Would the price of the alterations suit as SIL's wedding gift?", "You \"would\" BTA..... you already said you'd do it. In the future, when someone puts you in a financial corner, say \"I'll think about it\" and then take time to think about it.", "I'd be mortified asking people to foot the bill for my wedding, a totally nonessential thing. Heck have a potluck. Ahe should be saving money instead of going broke having a wedding.", "This.  You already agreed.  However, you can make this your wedding gift for her.", "Agreed, mildly YTA. Help a sister out, how much could alterations cost, $10?", "Let the alterations be your wedding gift. Two birds one stone", "I would say it's no longer worth helping her. Sounds like the bride is going to be homeless soon if she literally can't afford dress alterations but is spending thousands on other useless things. No one is entitled to a big wedding", "Pay for alterations in lieu of a gift", "It sounds like this poor woman has to pay for her own wedding as well from the sound of it.", "EVERYTHING about a wedding is optional. You are all acting like people are entitled to lavish weddings and like it's normal for people to go bankrupt for them. Grow up!", "I couldn't be happy for someone who is so broke but spending thousands on a lavish wedding. I'd feel sad and pathetic for her.", "If it's such a priority that she can't afford necessary dress alterations then she needs to have a wedding she can afford.", "Agreed! Idc if I agreed to pay for it if I find out you're bankrupting yourself for a gd wedding then NOPE. Totally teenage daydreamer bs right there. They need to grow up.", "When looking at venues for my wedding in a couple years, it\u2019s difficult to find a decent venue for under a couple thousand. If they cater the meals on site it\u2019s likely $5k for food and a venue and that\u2019s if we go for a cheaper place.", "Bride and groom showing up and being happy is the most important thing..!", "No, that would be actually getting married", "The dress is just as important too. If you can't afford dress alterations but spend thousands on other traditional wedding bs, then you're going to look silly not wearing a wedding dress.", "Depending on the dress materials, additional materials for the alterations, and the extent of said alterations, I would expect a couple hundred to possibly as much as $1,000.", "Yes, but YOU sound like a decent, appreciative person.  I'm not sure we can assume that about the SIL--because who the heck asks/demands someone pay for a part of their wedding(/dress).", "So it's ok going bankrupt for a wedding but not for other things?", "Can't argue with that", "Could it also be that the bride originally didn't need as $$$ alterations, but has gained/lost weight since and the cost has changed?", "That sounds great! I went to a pig roast wedding several years ago and the food was fantastic.", "That sounds great, love a good pig roast! And love pork goodie bags haha", "Exactly it\u2019s not about you per say but how you made your guests feel and did they have fun.", "Absolutely agree, if it was going to be a potential concern OP should have had the discussion earlier.", "https://youtu.be/90sPMhk_CdM", "Let's go alreadyyyy!", "Hilarious! I have to show that to my son, he sings every song \u201cin the style of Pearl Jam.\u201d", "I mean it\u2019s your money but I just got married and my highest costs were food and the venue. Idk where she\u2019s getting married but I can guarantee that will be in the thousands anywhere you go unless it\u2019s a backyard or a community center which are less than ideal\u2026 if you\u2019re only basing it on those two things then yes YTA. If there are other things like a limo, hair/makeup for all bridesmaids, extravagant bachelor/bachelorette party, or other stuff that are clearly optional then I\u2019ll change my judgment", "YWBTA because you agreed when asked, you could have politely decided at that time or inquired further into it.\n\nInstead of letting this bother you, pay for the alterations as a loving wedding gift and enjoy the celebration with the happy couple.", "ESH. Op, you said you\u2019d pay now you want to renege on that. Bit of a dick move but can see why you would. \n\nAnyone spending thousands on wedding suck, spend it on the marriage instead and live happy for life instead of one show off day. So IMO, the op\u2019s friends suck too.", "Do you also have to get her a wedding gift? I\u2019d pay for the alterations if that counted as the gift.", "Just pay for the alterations in lieu of a wedding gift.", "YTA. It's not your wedding, it's not your call, you said you'd help out - now you want to be the budget police? Come on, bruh.", "YTA because you said you would. You never had to offer that, but you did of your own volition. That is a gift and as a gift it stands alone. You don\u2019t get to retroactively retract your gift based on your judgment of the rest of her wedding spending. You probably don\u2019t even understand as much about her budget or outside contributions as your are assuming to.", "Wedding dress alterations is a necessity. You don\u2019t want an ill fitting dress on your wedding day. YTA", "YTA. Only because you flip flopped on her. If you didn't really want to then just say no at the start.", "Honestly, those costs don't even sound like a lavish wedding. I got married on a family member's farm, and we served breakfast food ordered from one of the cheapest places we could find. The wedding still cost about $10k. If she has 100 guests and the meals come out to ten bucks a head (which is dirt cheap), that is still a thousand for catering. Ours was $12-$15 a head, and that was only the food. No delivery, servers, or dishes. And breakfast is cheaper than any other meal. Unless OP expected her SIL to serve pizza in her backyard, she would inevitably be spending thousands on catering and venue.", "agree that the wedding posts are beyond ridiculous and tiresome. I'm so sick of the wedding industrial complex.", "Yeah, that one had me side-eyeing, lol.  Those are the big, important expenses.  I\u2019ve never planned a wedding but after reading into it, I was stunned at how much things cost these days."]}
