My priorities aren\u2019t theirs and that\u2019s ok. Pay for the alterations and call it a wedding gift.", "There's something about how the question is phrased that's backwards to me.

You don\u2019t know those details, so don\u2019t assume she\u2019s \u201cusing you\u201d to afford fancy catering.

Backing out now will definitely sour things.", "YWBTA How are the venue, catering, and a dress that fits properly *optional* items for a wedding? Why would you say yes and then back out? I don't see any legitimate reason to do that here. Just make that her wedding gift from you if you feel that way.", "YWBTA: You were okay with doing it initially and for the sake of her being able to have a wedding. In contrast to how much a wedding costs it seems like she asked you for help on a smaller ticket item. It\u2019s all frivolous in the grand scheme of things (Wedding costs) but it\u2019s not like she asked you to help pay for groceries and rent then went and spent a ton of money on a wedding.

You don't get to start economising this far into the planning process -- deposits are made, money is spent, and what money is in her account is pre-spent. She still has to pay her vendors. (Of course she's spending thousands of dollars on venue and catering, like, that's standard. Even super cheap weddings run to thousands, the venue and catering are the BIGGEST BILLS)\n\nThe time to criticise her budget decisions is like, months ago. And the time to say no, I can't pick up this bill for you, is when she asked you for the money. To go back on it now would understandably be upsetting for her, and to say the reason you are refusing is because she already spent a bunch of money on other things for your wedding would absolutely make you look like an asshole.\n\nThis is like saying that she asked you to pay for her kid's Christmas present because she ran out of money, and you agreed, but then you realised she had a kitchen full of food for Christmas dinner, and got mad about it.\n\nDon't say yes next time.", "Since you've told her that you would do it, I'd say YTA if you went back on it.

You should pay for the alterations and say that it is your wedding gift to them.", "YTA because you already said yes", "This!
