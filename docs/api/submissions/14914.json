Of course, it's your money and at the beginning you had no obligation to pay for something you disagreed with or didn't want to pay for, but now that you agreed to it, its a bit of an asshole move to back out later.", "NTA for your reasoning, AH to take your word back\u2026and based on demand she cover it by cutting back elsewhere. Had you said no earlier she can plan how she wants, but this is you judging her planning after the fact - not a good look.", "YTA you agreed to it so you should stick to your word. You can consider it a gift for the wedding and put a max amount for the alterations.", "Was she upfront about how much those alterations would cost, and if this was to be a loan or a gift from you to her? If she wasn\u2019t, and the alterations cost too much, you would not be the A H for telling her that. Maybe only slightly since you\u2019d offered to pay. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d either loan her the money for the alterations or make it clear that this is my wedding gift to her and she shouldn\u2019t expect another gift.", "Oof. You've already said yes, so backing out would make you TA. But you're not the A for feeling used. \n\nYta for the records.", "YTA\nShe asked you for help and you said yes, it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s spending thousands on other things, it\u2019s her wedding, not yours.", "NTA- OP can spend their money the way they want. The sister in law isn\u2019t entitled to OP\u2019s money. A verbal agreement isn\u2019t legally binding.", "Soft YTA. I'm only just starting on my own wedding planning and, despite my best efforts, venue and catering are absolutely gonna be the biggest cost - they are a priority and it's kinda for a good reason. There's plenty of places and ways that you can cut costs sure but venue and catering is not likely to be one of them.", "\nIf you are as well off as you claim to be to the point of offering to pay for the alterations, then retracting the help after finding out she's prioritizing others enjoyment at the wedding; that would make you the ahole for even offering in the first place (because it's like bragging).\n\nIf it's a larger amount just let them know that the alterations will be the wedding gift because of how expensive it is.\n\nOtherwise, understand that the dress isn't as important as the rest of the wedding and she is already prioritizing the wedding as a whole. If you say you're going to pay for the alterations, then you put your wallet where your mouth is.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is fine to ask ... you are fine to make it a NO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My husband thinks I should just pay for it to avoid any drama,\" .. Let HIM pay?", "Personally I think I\u2019d be crazy to plan a wedding when I\u2019m financially unstable. And if I was it would either have to be very small or a courthouse wedding (which is not in the question for me \ud83d\udd3aI\u2019d rather wait). But you promised to help your sister and now your back tracking on your promise. YTA, your husband is right just pay and avoid drama. You and you SIL don\u2019t want to be looking back on the wedding and feel bitter.", "YTA. You agreed to help so you need to hold up your end of the bargain.", "NTA in that it's your money so it's your right to do whatever you want. BUT you agreed in the first place, which I assume means you can afford it, so.... Why not? Personally, I would pay for the alterations as a wedding gift. You're going to be giving her something, so may as well be this thing that's important to her. Plus backing out after you agreed will be upsetting and probably cause a lot of unnecessary upset and drama with your husband's family.", "The venue and catering are almost automatically thousands of dollars. So what you're asking her to do is not have a reception if she's going to ask you to help alter the dress. YTA you said you would, it's not a stretch for you, and she's not being frivolous otherwise anyway.", "Why do you feel like you're being taken advantage of? You already said you'd pay for alterations so where do you think she should put her money?  Please explain further. For now YTA.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. \n\nPeople are allowed to reconsider, especially if they feel they are being taken advantage of. \n\nAlso, if she's struggling so much financially, why is she spending that much on a wedding? I don't get it. Either wait until you can afford that kind of wedding without asking for contributions, or scale it way down and have something that's affordable.", "You already said yes, so yes, YTA.", "I'd pay because you said you would.  It'd be the last time though.", "I'm sorry but YTA.\nWhy offer to do something if you're not going to do it?\nWhen you give a gift you give it unconditionally, it doesn't give you license to judge or control the recipient's actions.", "Your husband thinks YOU should pay? Is this his sister? If so, why isn't it something for him or both of you to pay?", "ESH \n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that you shouldn\u2019t get married if you can\u2019t afford it and therefore you should be very aware of your budget, as well as put extra aside for just in case expenses. I\u2019m pretty sure they can tell you roughly how much alterations will be if needed when you purchase/pick out the dress. \n\nOn the other hand, you already said yes and it\u2019s not nice to go back on your word just because you\u2019ve had a nosey into their existing spending on something that is expected to cost a fair bit of money. Next time I\u2019d advise giving a non committal answer, like \u201c I\u2019ll have to think about it and get back to you\u201d or \u201cI would like to know if you have tried to fund this yourself first, I can\u2019t promise I can pay for the whole thing but MAYBE I can contribute towards it\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve never agreed with this whole idea of expecting wedding gifts but I guess at very least you could think of this as a very expensive wedding gift (assuming the alteration cost is excessive of the usual, excessive imo, $200+ gift expectation) \n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to hear the entitled responses to my comment, we don\u2019t all have to see eye to eye on these things. A wedding is a sentimental occasion, that costs a lot, not an excuse to bleed your friends and relatives of material goods and money.", "SOFT YTA. You of course shouldn\u2019t feel pressured into paying for something you don\u2019t want to. But like\u2026the entirety of a wedding is unnecessary, and you\u2019re wanting to be picky about what the bride is doing with her own wedding. It\u2019s not really up to you to decide what is or isn\u2019t necessary. \n\nSay she didn\u2019t ask you to help with the dress alterations. She asked you to pay for something frivolous that she didn\u2019t need, like decorations or something. You\u2019d still find a way to be upset about it because \u201cthat\u2019s not important enough for me to pay for.\u201d \n\nSee why that doesn\u2019t make sense? At the very least, alterations is something important that you\u2019re taking a part in. If you were going to attach strings to your paying, you should\u2019ve been up front about what you were willing to pay for when she first asked.", "YTA. You agreed to pay. You are able to do so. Do it and let it go.", "You are N T A for not wanting to, but you did already agree. So YTA for reneging on a promise.\n\nNext time find out the real situation BEFORE you agree to pay for something.", "Why are there so many posts about altering wedding dresses recently", "NTA. New information came to your knowledge that made you reconsider your decision, it doesn\u2019t sound like a \u00ab\u00a0backing out\u00a0after giving your word\u00a0\u00bb situation but \u00ab\u00a0feeling like people abuse of your means because they can\u00a0\u00bb. If people can\u2019t afford weddings, just don\u2019t have them, make them smaller, just don\u2019t ask huge sums from others (1000$ for dress alterations is waaay above normal wedding gift budget).", "YTA. For all you know the alterations are the extra little luxury she would only allow herself if you said yes. Which you did. Can you clarify why her asking you nicely for a gift is you being \"taken advantage of?\"", "NTA. If she can\u2019t afford the alterations she can\u2019t afford to get married.", "Since you already told her that you would pay, you should keep your commitment.  If you had not told her, then I would say it\u2019s not your responsibility.", "When you said yes you didn't really do it with any stipulations like \"don't spend your money on other things.\" I think pulling out entirely YWBTA but I think setting a specific amount you'll help her with is fine.", "Give her $100 for the alterations and tell her that the rest is on her since it is her dress.\n\nNTA", "ESH - her for not prioritizing, you for wanting to renege on something you said you do.\n\nIf anything, consider this a lesson learned and do not offer financial support in the future.", "ESH. Just pay it but be prepared to put your foot down in the future. Or make it clear it\u2019s a wedding gift.", "Soft YTA because I get what it\u2019s like to be taken advantage of but you said you would do it. Tell her that\u2019s her wedding present.", "You'd be in the clear if you just told her no in the first place.  You can't say and then judge her other spending for the wedding. slight yta", "Right? Like how weird of this bride to just randomly decide that a minor (financially speaking) part of wedding planning had to be paid for by someone else. Why not just ask for a bit of money for general costs instead of money for a specific and random thing?", "A limit is a great idea. OP could even just write a check for a set amount (maybe do some research on the average cost) and give it to the bride before she even asks/goes for the alterations.", "I'm going to play devil's advocate here and say all of things ARE optional for a wedding. My wedding dress consisted of an on sale dress I found at JC Penny. The venue was aty neighbors house. The catering was none. My neighbors treated us to a meal at a nice local restaurant. We knew we couldn't afford a huge wedding and did what we COULD afford. The idea that you NEED a huge expensive wedding with everyone you know being invited has always seemed extremely odd to me.", "Agreed. This is such a weird situation.", "OP is TA because she agreed to do something and is breaking her word. \n\nIf she didn't want to she could have said no and she'd be NTA.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f", "Actually, once the SIL asked, & the OP agreed (whether SIL should have asked, or OP should have agreed, isn't relevant once the comment has been made), then OP owes her SIL the help she promised her.", "\u201cThey served us cereal but daaaang that dress fit like a glove! Way to prioritize!\u201d", "Idk, OP might be thinking that what the bride is literally wearing would come first. It\u2019s odd that the bride didn\u2019t have the dress settled first. I\u2019d also be curious to know whether there were cheaper venues or catering options.", "Also, non-necessity?\n\nIf the dress is strapless, then alterations might be the only way to make sure it stays on her.\n\nOP is being really weird about this. All of these are legit wedding expenses. Why is.she mad that the bride is spending \"thousands\" on the big ones when she's only been asked to sponsor a minor one?\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m trying to plan a mini wedding this summer and I\u2019m probably going to spend around 5k, it\u2019s super easy to go off the rails. This is for ~25 people and a not-really-wedding venue.", "I can't tell if your comment is sarcastic or not. Assuming it's not...Well, generally backing out of a commitment on which someone to whom you've made the commitment is depending (barring a significant change of circumstance, which this doesn't appear to include) is considered...sleazy/bad form/unethical...", "Haha! I\u2019ve been to a wedding where the family just BBQed food, but a Froot Loop wedding would be wild", "At my brother's park wedding reception, we only had outhouses to use while the bride had separate ceremony and reception gowns.\n\nMade an impression.", "Maybe. Though the whole thing just seems like a misunderstanding. OP seems to have had the assumption the bride was cutting all corners possible before asking for financial help (which is understandable), but the bride may have just been looking for a bit of support to help have the wedding she wanted", "BBQ wedding sounds like a lot of fun!", "I think Bender says \u201cblackjack and hookers\u201d", "One of my friends did this - it was a 2nd wedding for him and his wife wasn't a \"pomp and circumstance\" sort of woman. They got married with just their witnesses present and then had a catered barbeque cooked on site in his mom's yard. The food was AMAZING and it was a great party - definitely non-traditional for a wedding, but a fantastic party!", "Bender has so many good phrases!", "Shut up baby, I know it!", "I'm gonna have my own wedding, with blackjack and hookers. You know what, forget the blackjack."]}
