Her reasoning is still the same technically, she cannot afford it. It\u2019s honestly none of your business WHY she can\u2019t. She said she can\u2019t, you said you\u2019d pay, but because you don\u2019t like where her money went, it\u2019s no longer worth helping her?", "YTA (just a little). If someone asks for your help and you agree, you don\u2019t get to audit their balance sheets to ensure they\u2019re spending to your standards. \n\nI think big Weddings are stupid and expensive and I don\u2019t find any of it economically worthwhile, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t celebrate with my friends at theirs or don\u2019t happily buy them gifts. My priorities aren\u2019t theirs and that\u2019s ok. Pay for the alterations and call it a wedding gift.", "There's something about how the question is phrased that's backwards to me. Weddings are really expensive. It's hardly surprising that your SIL is spending thousands of dollars. Isn't that the reason why she asked for your help in the first place?", "YTA. You said yes, so keep to your word. My first thought is, what if she has other people paying for the venues and catering? Like parents, or her partners family? You don\u2019t know those details, so don\u2019t assume she\u2019s \u201cusing you\u201d to afford fancy catering. She could, individually, still be financially stressed. \n\nYour husband is right, it\u2019s unnecessary drama.", "INFO- how much is her dress alterations actually going to cost? You\u2019ve kind of put yourself in a spot by already saying yes to it.", "YWBTA because you already said yes, though you can put a limit on how much you'll give. In the future, feel free to just say no in the first place or say \"Let me think about it and get back to you in a week\" and then go do your research first. Backing out now will definitely sour things.", "YWBTA How are the venue, catering, and a dress that fits properly *optional* items for a wedding? Why would you say yes and then back out? I don't see any legitimate reason to do that here. Just make that her wedding gift from you if you feel that way.", "YWBTA: You were okay with doing it initially and for the sake of her being able to have a wedding. In contrast to how much a wedding costs it seems like she asked you for help on a smaller ticket item. It\u2019s all frivolous in the grand scheme of things (Wedding costs) but it\u2019s not like she asked you to help pay for groceries and rent then went and spent a ton of money on a wedding. It is indeed a wedding and weddings cost money. Ultimately your choice but it\u2019s AH move to start judging her and going back on your word.", "YTA. You said you\u2019d do it.", "INFO: Is this supposed to be your wedding present to her? \n\nWithout more information, I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to, but I think if you agreed to it and she\u2019s counting on it then you should. \n\nI personally think it\u2019s weird that she specifically asked you and not your husband.", "YTA for saying you\u2019d pay then backing out. Consider it her wedding gift.", "YTA - You said you would", "YTA. **No matter what**, you already said you'd do it.", "NTA\n\nBut if you do proceed be VERY clear you will only pay <insert amount here> and will not pay a cent over \n\nIf she wants an expensive wedding that\u2019s fine but if she can\u2019t afford it right now then maybe she needs to wait until she\u2019s in a better financial position and she can\u2019t use your kindness as her own personal ATM", "NTA-if your husband thinks you should just pay then why doesn\u2019t he just pay it?\n\nIt is actually wild to me that someone would even ask this!", "YWBTA only because you already agreed. It will cause a huuuuge stink if you pull out now. So be prepared if you choose that path.", "YTA\nYou said you would. You didn't say \"sure, if I agree with how you're spending the money you DO have for the wedding.\" \n\nI agree with you, in principle,  that she should have been more careful in allocating the money she does have for the wedding but it doesn't sound like you asked many questions or set any limits,  so she can't be faulted for relying on your promise and carrying on with the rest of the planning. \n\n\n If I were you,  I would have put a cap on how much you were willing to spend because I have seen people essentially build a whole different dress during \"alterations\" and it can run into a pretty hefty sum.\n\nPay for the alterations and make that your wedding gift.", "YWBTA\n\nYou already agreed so SiL made a wedding budget including your money in it. If you back out now, they would have to rearrange everything.\n\nJust do it as a wedding gift and don't buy anything else. Oh, and make sure that SiL, all family members and friends know that this is going to be your gift - to avoid any drama, of course.", "NTA - But you agreed already and short of it being a hardship for you should honor that. Just don't make the same mistake twice.", "YTA, the venue and catering are 2 of the most expensive items in a wedding and are going to cost $$$. You said you\u2019d pay so be a person on your word, it would be crappy of you to back out. It\u2019s not like she asked you to pay for a frivolous item added at the last minute.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve already said yes. If these things bothered you why didn\u2019t you ask more beforehand? Also, just because you are contributing to get the dress altered does NOT mean you get to dictate how the rest of the money is spent.\n\nIf you want to put a limit on the amount you pay that\u2019s one thing but completely taking it away because she\u2019s paying for catering and a venue is crazy.", "Anything that has to do with weddings is not a necessity. You can offer to give their wedding gift ahead of time to go toward alterations, only if you really want to. Has she told you how much it will be? Alterations can go up in price very quickly, in my area it can be up to 1000 dollars for a normal dress, more for ballgown\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis isn't your wedding.
