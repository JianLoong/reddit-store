I'm known in my friend group as being a good cook and a good baker, I think it's fun and it's one of my hobbies. I have this one cake that she REALLY loves so I offered to make it for her birthday party and she said yes excitedly. The thing about this cake is it's very labor intensive to make, it has a lot of components and they're all from scratch. She sent me a list of the people coming (10 total) so I made enough cake for about \\~14ish people as I wanted her to have some leftovers for the next couple of days.\n\nI ended up spending like 40 bucks on the ingredients b/c I was missing alot of them, so I had to buy a lot, even if the recipe only needed a small amount (ex. I would have to buy a whole pack of Dutch cocoa powder, even though the recipe only needs 2 tablespoons because I didn't have it in my pantry, etc.) This was fine and didn't bother me because I offered to make the cake. It took about 5 in a half hours before the cake was finally done and by then it was about an hour before the party starts.\n\nThat's when my friend texted me, and said that some of the people we're going to bring extra friends. By this point, I didn't have time to make any more cake, but I figured it was fine as I had made extra to begin with and figured it would even out so I texted her saying it was all good and I'd see her soon. Well, it did not turn out all good. When I got there it was around 7-8 people, and we started drinking. She opened some of her presents while we \"waited for the others to show up\". Oh boy, they did. By the time the next hour had passed, there were at least 35 people in attendance. Clearly, we didn't have enough cake, but by this point, I was already like $97 deep between cake, uber, and her present so I didn't want to go buy an extra, and didn't even know how I would as I didn't have my car and had been drinking. \n\n\"Alright, guys! Time to feed everyone!\" I swear to God I almost shit myself right then and there. She walked over to the fridge where I told her I put it and I saw the realization hit her when she looked inside. She literally said to me in front of everyone \"That's it? This isn't enough for everyone\". I responded that she originally said only 10 people were coming, and when she texted me saying more people would attend I just didn't have time to make more. Luckily a couple of people broke some of the tension saying they had already eaten and didn't need any, and the party came back to life an hour or so later. \n\nShe pulled me aside before I went home and said thank you for the cake I made and that it was very good, but I really should have checked in with her before to see if it was enough. I countered that she could have specified how many extra people were going to come, and she said I could have just asked her to clarify. The tone got kinda tense and she even called me a dick before leaving. AITA for not bringing enough cake to my friend's birthday party?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would just start to be embarrassed for myself for not understanding how many people there would be or for being ill prepared"]}
