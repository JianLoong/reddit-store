The issue came in, when she said \"so now you don't need to come\" I took that as her uninviting me. I didn't push, I didn't pry. I just wished her well and hoped her event goes well. The event happened yesterday (Friday night) and around 20:00 p.m, my phone was BLOWING UP with texts from her saying I'm a bad friend, an AH and that if I was jealous over her choosing another caterer, I should've accepted her terms. I told her that she uninvited me and that me not coming wasn't about the catering job, I asked if she really did uninvite me or if it was me taking what she said, wrong.

There is no logic or friendship there.", "Not petty. You followed her instructions. \"Now you don't need to come\" is literally uninviting. She was clear she didn't want you there, and there is a reasonable possibility she would have been equally annoyed if you HAD attended - until your friends noticed your absence and she likely got called out. You are NTA. She is the AH. Do you still want to be friends with her? I wouldn't.", "NTA for sure. \n\nSounds like your acquaintance uninvited you and when she realized she was an AH in front of common friends, she threw you under the bus to save face.\n\nNow you know her true colors, keep her at a distance.", "NTA\n\nEven if she said \"now you don't have to come\" as a joke (meaning she wanted you to come) - I don't understand why she is blowing up on you. I guess also INFO: how did you reacted back then when she made that comment?", "Aren\u2019t you people too old for high school drama?", "NTA. She uninvited you. I also think she only hired the other cater to have a jab at you for not doing the job for free.", "NTA. But at least now you know where you stand with your \"friends\"", "NTA and  this individual is hostile. and nasty when she perceives a slight. WOW. NTA and my advice is to go low or no contact", "NTA- she made the decision to say what she did and now is upset? Jeez she sounds like a fantastic friend. Sarcasm implied there. Lol what were you supposed to do show up and then her tell you to leave as you weren\u2019t invited? Feels like she is the type to do that. Tell her to eat dust", "NTA she said \u201cnow you don\u2019t have to come\u201d not \u201dnow you can come as a guest \u201c I would have presumed I was uninvited as well.", "NTA\n\nShe uninvited you end of discussion.", "NTA. She explicitly uninvited you, and the only reason she invited you in the first place was so she could cop free labor and professional quality catering. Repeat these facts as necessary to anyone who asks. If they still express disapproval, ask them which aspects of the party they paid for or let themselves be used to provide. If the answer was \"nothing\", then they were invited guests. You weren't an invited guest, just someone the hostess tried to manipulate so she could get something for nothing.", "NTA if she used the actual words \"so now you don't need to come\". Because how else are you supposed to understand those words?", "NTA-she doesn't sound like a good friend.", "NTA and the way she worded it sounds very much like she uninvited you. I agree with your question mark, this person doesn't sound like a friend.", "she said \"so now you don't need to come\"\n\nYeah, you were uninvited. Rather toxic \"friend\" to be attacking you for simply not attending.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were asked to provide a service for your friend's event and you made it clear that you expected to be paid for your work. It's reasonable for you to expect payment for the services you provide, regardless of whether or not you are friends with the person who is hiring you.\n\nWhen your friend decided to hire another caterer, she essentially canceled your catering contract, and you were no longer obligated to attend the event. It's understandable that you took her statement of \"now you don't need to come\" as an uninvitation. It's also reasonable for you to want clarification on whether or not you were still invited to the event, and for you to respect her decision if she chose to uninvite you.\n\nYour friend's reaction towards you was not fair or justified, and it's not okay for her to berate you for not attending an event that she essentially uninvited you from. It's important for friends to respect each other's boundaries and communicate with each other in a mature and respectful manner.\n\nOverall, it's important to stand up for your business and your boundaries, even if it means potentially losing a friendship. It's not okay for friends to take advantage of each other, and it's important to hold them accountable for their actions.", "NTA. But to be honest I\u2019m not sure to tell if your \u201cfriend\u201d is the asshole either. I don\u2019t know, it seems to me that you both had a miscommunication problem.\n\nI mean, yes, your friend was a AH for assuming you would be catering for free and not wanting to contract your service. But as for the invitation part, I\u2019m not sure this was an uninvited situation. The phrase \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come anymore\u201d was kind of mislead if it was just for the catering service or as a guest as well.\n\nAnyways, it doesn\u2019t seems right that she called you to scream at you and call you an AH, friendships shouldn\u2019t be that toxic. If her friendship means anything to you, I would try to meet her and be honest about your feelings regarding this situation and just understand where you guys had this problem on communication.\n\nWishing you the best \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA at all it sounded like she uninvited you simply because she couldn\u2019t take advantage of you or your services.

Best drop her and anyone who called you petty for it OP cause you ain\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. She told you not to come. So you did not come. She wanted to take advantage of you.

I honestly don't see a life where I lose sleep over this \"friendship\" loss", ">she threw you under the bus to save face.\n\nThis is actually what she did.

She uninvited you and you therefore did not attend. It's that simple. She is mad because it has made her look stupid. She is NOT a friend by the way.

At the party, maybe all the questions about where you were probably made her feel uncomfortable so she is trying to blame shift now so she looks good in front of the friends.", "When I hired my aunt for wedding catering, with her bringing in some of her relatives to help, she had to haggle me down on what I wanted to give them for their help. I also paid her full price. Your friend is the asshole there already. And to then uninvite you then lie to everyone about it?

Your mutual friends suggested you as the caterer.  \n\nShe stated to you that she wanted the friends and family price of free.99. This is an obvious negative ghostrider.  You give price, she says yes and proceeds to find different caterer and uninvited you.\n\nShe lied to mutual friends that you turned her down because you wanted to be a guest, and when you did not show, they called her on her bullshit.  The food was mediocre, and everyone commented that you would have been a much better choice. \n\nSo obviously, it is OP's fault for being better than the people she probably paid more than OP was charging and for not just doing it for free.\n\nThe lies and entitlement is strong with this one.  Blow her a kiss on the way out of your life.", "NTA- but this person is definitely not your friend.", "I think \"I found another caterer, so you can just come as a friend...\" is a way more obvious way to phrase that if she didn't actually have a bee in her bonnet about you not wanting to work for free. So she decided to try and make you feel unwelcome on purpose, and then she called you while hosting her own party to scream at you and deflect any responsibility for being shitty to someone who had mutual friends at the party (probably asking why you weren't there). All of this points to you being NTA, but this friend(?) definitely is.", "NTA. Friends support other friend\u2019s business. She really paid a different caterer, but refused to pay you. Girl she HATES you.", "NTA- who speaks to their friends that way?", "NTA \n\nYour friend tried so much to get back at you for not giving her a free service. She's trying to let everyone gang up on you and by telling lies. She's clearly not your friend. I'd cut off all contact with her if I was in you", "NO. Very simple. She said it not you", "NTA but at this point, I'd be questioning the friendship as a whole. Her reaction to her own mess is abhorrent. She should have supported you as a new business owner by paying you. She clearly uninvited you, and rudly so. And when she started seeing that she was in the wrong, she gaslit and manipulated others into thinking you were just in a jealous rage. Nah, throw that whole friend out. Lol", "NTA\nYour friend invited you pretty much because they wanted free catering. You declined and expected pay. Found a new caterer and uninvited. Point blank. That is it. You didn't get upset and just took the uninvite gracefully. Then get yelled at for not going to something you weren't invited to. What would have happened if you showed up after getting uninvited? That's party crashing in my opinion.", "Nta. \n\nBut after the way she just spoke to you, I would never let her stay in my life again and cut her completely out. I would never spend another second with her. \n\nShe was taking advantage of you, and was hoping you would cave and do the work for free. She didn't have a caterer, it was her trying to manipulate you. \n\nThis person isn't your friend. Cut them out and leave them behind.", "NTA, but why would you send her to your brother? It sounds like she'd insist on not paying.", "NTA. If you were uninvited, why would you have still showed up? She\u2019s also shitty trying to play the \u201ca real friend would cater this for free\u201d excuse in the first place. \n\nAlso I\u2019m cracking up reading the screenshots at you telling her your brother is an anger management therapist and giving her his contact info \ud83d\ude02", "NTA", "NTA. She and anyone else who called you \"petty\" are not your real friends. Time to do weed some drama out of your life.", "\"So now you don't need to come\" suggests the only reason she invited you in the first place was to provide free catering. She was fine with uninviting you until your other friends called her out.  Then she lied about what actually happened. \n\nI'm also thinking she uninvited you to get you to beg to come so she could force her \"terms\" on you.", "NTA - she seems like she is not only bad at communication but also purposefully set this up to be as petty as possible", "NTA\n\nYou 100% need to keep your distance from this person.

You are obviously NTA.", "Nothing drives a manipulator crazier than the person being manipulated not getting upset; not being steered, just accepting that we all are free to make our own decisions.  \n\nShe assumed your need for her friendship was an advantage.  She assumed her uninviting you would force you to capitulate and agree to her terms (what terms; she wanted your professional services for free), she wanted you to be jealous and resentful and you weren\u2019t.  You gave her such a bad time by nit allowing her to steer you into giving her what she wanted.", "NTA and congratulations on this bridge burning down because she sounds crazy judging by the screenshots.\nYes, her statement was clearly a rescinded invitation - and she likely meant it as that in the moment. She is just mad that mutual friends called her out.\nKudos to some of your responses. The one about your brother made me laugh out loud.\nMercedes and Angelo rock.", "NTA. And it's really rich that your \"friend\" is throwing a fit because you didn't \"support\" her by attending a party she uninvited you from, but she was willing to ask you to cater the same party without payment. A true *friend* would be delighted to pay you and support your business because that's what friends do. They don't expect a fledgling business to give them handouts, they give their friends their business specifically to help that business prosper and grow. People at the party probably asked why she *didn't * hire you to cater, and she got defensive and tried to turn it back on you, portray you as a villain who didn't attend her party and support *her* (because people need their friends' support to host parties???). Everyone knows who the AH is here.", "NTA.  If she was really your friend, she would want you to be successful, which means paying for your services.  Someone who finds you useful is never your friend.", "NTA,  they are not your friend", "Wow those screenshots are so mean! I would definitely not stay her friend after that. And you were so civil to her. Definitely NTA.", "If you were only \u201cinvited\u201d as a form of compensation for your work\u2026 then you\u2019re the help, not a guest.

This person, I would not call it a friend, definitely uninvited you from the party. Now she is catching shit for her double-dealing ways and does not like it. I read the texts, and she clearly does not want to admit she revoked the invitation and is playing word games.\n\nBag this person as a friend and deposit on the side of the road with the rest of the party trash.\n\nClearly **NTA**!", "INFO: You're going to get easy N-T-As based on what you wrote, but it really sounds like you're leaving someone out.  It reminds me of [the sitcom scene](https://medium.com/@smschuh/spoiler-alert-5f1644d89cd7) where a guy's friends hate his new girlfriend, and he doesn't understand why.  But turns out it was because he blocked out how rude she was.  So my question is whether you're also omitting rudeness that occurred between her asking you to cater and her saying you didn't have to come because she found another caterer.  Because if, say, you accused her of only inviting you to get free services or of being a bad friend to refuse to support your business, that would explain her subsequent behavior better than anything you actually related.  Because the post currently makes it sound like you merely politely informed her that you would have to charge for food and services.", "Because how else are you supposed to understand those words.", "I was going to say this exact thing, only not as well as you did. NTA.", " I agree with your question mark, this person doesn't sound like a friend.", "When she said I no longer needed to come it was over a phonecall, so I said \"Oh...okay, no problem. I think I'll just see my sister this Friday anyway, hope your event goes great though\"\n\nEdit: grammar", "I suspect she cut a lot of corners on the catering, realized how bad things were and instead of thinking, \u201cThis is my fault for not paying for a decent caterer. I owe OP an apology\u201d thought \u201cThis is OP\u2019s fault for some reason. I\u2019m owed an apology!!\u201d", "Apparently the food was very...bland. I don't want to speak down another business but that's legitimately what I've heard", "Thank you so much!! \u2665\ufe0f", "I'd like to call myself a nice person in general but boy do I have my petty moments \ud83d\ude02", "Oh man, my wife\u2019s mother acts like OP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d. She\u2019s 45 and treats everyone like they owe her.", "Click through to OP\u2019s profile and look at their post with the screenshots. Other lady is definitely the AH", "I really tried my best to keep my cool tbh...I'm not a confrontational person by any means, but wow...", "Juat to clarify, it wasn't her and I alone during the lunch, she asked me if I'd be her caterer amongst other people too. I told her, politely, that I can't do it for free after she asked. It was during the week (Monday) when she told me she'd found someone else. I told her no problem after she said I didn't need to come anymore. Her tone didn't imply she was joking either, which is why I'm confused as to whether it was a simple miscommunication. I have nothing to gain from lying about it. I offer catering services for which I charge, regardless of whether the client is family, friend or not. I've catered for other friends too, but they've never asked for free anything. I mean, I've never been asked to work for free? and this person was a supposed friend? how am I supposed to react? I was as respectful and polite as I could've been, as much as I owed her", "Why do I think she has this whole fantasy where people would compliment the food, and she would say it was much better than yours and you deprived her of the opportunity to harass you for the colossal snub of daring to refuse the honor of catering her party for free without even reimbursing you for the food and that was why she had a meltdown.  She didn't have a way to have \"entertainment\" for the event.", "I also think she only hired the other cater to have a jab at you for not doing the job for free.", "Sounds like there was exactly zero confusion.  She uninvited you.  You accepted the uninvitation and made other plans.  Both of you were clear.  Until she started getting criticized by other people.   Now she\u2019s lashing out at you?  No.  Just no.", "Yeh, that was clear enough to say you weren't coming. If she didn't give a logical reason why she thought you will be there- you need to reconsider keeping ties with that person (on your original post you wrote ''friend?'' Which says a lot already).", "Definitely sounds like she uninvited you. In addition, you responded saying you would make other plans. Case closed.\nShe totally uninvited you. She was just hoping she could hide her mean girl antics from the rest of your group by making it look like you were petty over the caterer. \nYou were darned either way. If you had no taken her seriously and shown up, that would have also caused problems.\nThis was the way to be completely NTA.", "Drop this person like a hot rock. It would be one thing if they asked for a discount but for free? And then blowing up the way they did?\n\nThey are not worth the hassle. I would be careful about the possibility of bad reviews even if they are absolutely false.", "I think you did a great job. I had something similar happen last year. First time anything like that had ever happened to me in my adult life. The woman acted like we were in middle school, and my texts were pretty civil. There were things I wished I had said, but it definitely makes it easy to explain when I show people the texts. She was the mean girl and I was the rational person. Needless to say we don\u2019t talk anymore. It\u2019s hard to lose a friend but it\u2019s more difficult to keep a friend like that around. Good job.", "This! That Mercedes sounds like a keeper.", "I think this is exactly what happened.  You nailed it.\n\nOP is NTA", "Ofcourse...how do I do that? I'm using mobile", "I think the person above is saying to send screenshots to your mutual friends. The way she\u2019s speaking to you is abhorrent, and even if her anger WAS valid she has no fucking right to speak to you that way.", "Just screen shot your text conversation. Usually by holding down power and volume button. Then attach files and send to friends.", "Hot girls are nice!! She sounds nasty and you\u2019re def better off without her", "Oh my goodness \ud83d\udc80 and here I am creating a separate post just for the screenshots lmao.", "That\u2019s okay \ud83d\ude02 but yeah if I were you, I\u2019d send them both the conversation where she uninvited you and this one where she\u2019s an unhinged psycho!", "Lol don't worry, it shows us clearly how absolutely unhinged she is.  There is no room for doubt that you are NTA. Love how you ended that convo with your brother's contact information too \ud83d\ude02", "I genuinely think she has anger issues lmao, I tried my best to keep it as civil as I could because I really don't know what she's going through to be reacting that way. Come to think of it, my post didn't do her actual messages justice"]}
