Mutual friends of ours were in attendance. She told me about it over lunch and asked if I'd be available to cater as well. I obviously accepted. However, she didn't want to pay and used the \"we're friends\" excuse. I told her I'd happily be there to support her but as far as my business goes -- I expect full payment.

You friend does need to work on their communication skills though. That\u2019s insanely childish of her.", "NTA, sounds like she uninvited you to me, and then when the mutual friends asked where you were, she passed all the blame onto you to make you look bad.\n\nI'd just stay away from the friend (?) and the mutual friends who agreed with her for awhile, and just concentrate on the friends who backed you.", "My guess is that she really did intend to uninvite you, then others commented on your absence, and her call was an attempt to save face by gaslighting you so that she wouldn't look like the petty one who ditched you when you wouldn't work for free.\n\nNTA.", "How dare she expect you to offer your business services for free.  At that point, she's no longer your friend.  No need to read further.", "NTA. This is a miscommunication at best and manipulation at worst. Maybe your friend meant \u201cI don\u2019t *need* you to come\u2026 but you\u2019re still invited\u201d and maybe she wanted you not to show up so she could put you on blast and make you look like the asshole to your mutual friends. Either way, you\u2019re not at fault for taking what she said as an un-invitation. I hope the situation gets cleared up for you.", "NTA\n\nWhy exactly are you friends with this person? I'm not exactly reading any positives...", "NTA- Honestly even chewing someone out for not coming to your party is an AH move unless it was a significant other, or parents/siblings maybe if it was a family thing. She was rude to even address it. Should have just invited you nicely to the next one and hoped that this all has passed. \u201cFriend\u201d is the AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She wanted to take advantage of you, and when you weren't having that she told you not to come. I don't see any other way to interpret that other than telling you not to come even as a guest.", "She is not friend. She is an asshole. NTA.", "NTA\n\nCatering without paying? She\u2019s insane\u2026 a \u201cfriend\u201d might reduce the price or only charge for food and setup but that isn\u2019t mandatory.\n\nHeck, I hired a friend for our wedding and asked to work with our budget and constraints. Not to do it for free. Your \u201cfriend\u201d needs to mature.", "NTA. But change \u201ca friend (?)\u201d to \u201csomeone I used to know.\u201d \n\nShe was going to use you and somehow blame you for not showing up to a party *she uninvited* you from. There is no logic or friendship there.", "Not petty. You followed her instructions. \"Now you don't need to come\" is literally uninviting. She was clear she didn't want you there, and there is a reasonable possibility she would have been equally annoyed if you HAD attended - until your friends noticed your absence and she likely got called out. You are NTA. She is the AH. Do you still want to be friends with her? I wouldn't.", "NTA for sure. \n\nSounds like your acquaintance uninvited you and when she realized she was an AH in front of common friends, she threw you under the bus to save face.\n\nNow you know her true colors, keep her at a distance.", "NTA\n\nEven if she said \"now you don't have to come\" as a joke (meaning she wanted you to come) - I don't understand why she is blowing up on you. I guess also INFO: how did you reacted back then when she made that comment?", "Aren\u2019t you people too old for high school drama?", "NTA. She uninvited you. I also think she only hired the other cater to have a jab at you for not doing the job for free.", "NTA. But at least now you know where you stand with your \"friends\"", "NTA and  this individual is hostile. and nasty when she perceives a slight. WOW. NTA and my advice is to go low or no contact", "NTA- she made the decision to say what she did and now is upset? Jeez she sounds like a fantastic friend. Sarcasm implied there. Lol what were you supposed to do show up and then her tell you to leave as you weren\u2019t invited? Feels like she is the type to do that. Tell her to eat dust", "NTA she said \u201cnow you don\u2019t have to come\u201d not \u201dnow you can come as a guest \u201c I would have presumed I was uninvited as well.", "NTA\n\nShe uninvited you end of discussion.", "NTA. She explicitly uninvited you, and the only reason she invited you in the first place was so she could cop free labor and professional quality catering. Repeat these facts as necessary to anyone who asks. If they still express disapproval, ask them which aspects of the party they paid for or let themselves be used to provide. If the answer was \"nothing\", then they were invited guests. You weren't an invited guest, just someone the hostess tried to manipulate so she could get something for nothing.", "NTA if she used the actual words \"so now you don't need to come\". Because how else are you supposed to understand those words?", "NTA-she doesn't sound like a good friend.", "NTA and the way she worded it sounds very much like she uninvited you. I agree with your question mark, this person doesn't sound like a friend.", "she said \"so now you don't need to come\"\n\nYeah, you were uninvited. Rather toxic \"friend\" to be attacking you for simply not attending.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were asked to provide a service for your friend's event and you made it clear that you expected to be paid for your work. It's reasonable for you to expect payment for the services you provide, regardless of whether or not you are friends with the person who is hiring you.\n\nWhen your friend decided to hire another caterer, she essentially canceled your catering contract, and you were no longer obligated to attend the event. It's understandable that you took her statement of \"now you don't need to come\" as an uninvitation. It's also reasonable for you to want clarification on whether or not you were still invited to the event, and for you to respect her decision if she chose to uninvite you.\n\nYour friend's reaction towards you was not fair or justified, and it's not okay for her to berate you for not attending an event that she essentially uninvited you from. It's important for friends to respect each other's boundaries and communicate with each other in a mature and respectful manner.\n\nOverall, it's important to stand up for your business and your boundaries, even if it means potentially losing a friendship. It's not okay for friends to take advantage of each other, and it's important to hold them accountable for their actions.", "NTA. But to be honest I\u2019m not sure to tell if your \u201cfriend\u201d is the asshole either. I don\u2019t know, it seems to me that you both had a miscommunication problem.\n\nI mean, yes, your friend was a AH for assuming you would be catering for free and not wanting to contract your service. But as for the invitation part, I\u2019m not sure this was an uninvited situation. The phrase \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come anymore\u201d was kind of mislead if it was just for the catering service or as a guest as well.\n\nAnyways, it doesn\u2019t seems right that she called you to scream at you and call you an AH, friendships shouldn\u2019t be that toxic. If her friendship means anything to you, I would try to meet her and be honest about your feelings regarding this situation and just understand where you guys had this problem on communication.\n\nWishing you the best \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA at all it sounded like she uninvited you simply because she couldn\u2019t take advantage of you or your services. Then she has the audacity to blow up at YOU for not going? She doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend to you at all. Best drop her and anyone who called you petty for it OP cause you ain\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. She told you not to come. So you did not come. She wanted to take advantage of you. You didn't play along. Good for you.", "If what you wrote was really what she said, then that was a reasonable interpretation.\n\nNTA.", "Nta shes addicted to drama", "We met like 2/3 years ago? can't recall exactly, but it was through mutual friends of mine, people I've known since highschool and college...I wouldn't say we're super duper close and all that, but she's been around for a lot and I'm starting to think that because of who she is, it's going to break this friend group unnecessarily", "Tbh, she and I met through mutual friends (coincidentally the ones who have taken my side through all this) and she's kind of the self-proclaimed mean girl of our friend group. I honestly don't see a life where I lose sleep over this \"friendship\" loss", ">she threw you under the bus to save face.\n\nThis is actually what she did. When another friend reached out & asked why I wasn't there, he informed me that she \"threw a fit in front everyone\" almost equivalent to an emotional breakdown & said I \"abandoned\" her.", "Also, wouldn't the friend get that OP thought she was uninvited when OP wished the friend a nice party?", "This is exactly why I'm so conflicted...perhaps I *did* take it the wrong way and maybe her yelling at me wasn't the best time to ask her if that *was* what she meant \n\nBut thank you for this insight!! have a good day or night x", "Send screenshots of your convo.", "\u2764\ufe0f It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders, OP! And self-proclaimed mean girl? LMFAO! She sounds ridiculous. She's also in for a self-imposed hard life. No friend group needs a mean girl. And most grown women don't tolerate that crap for a second.", "And now you know which mutual friends to stay in touch with, and which are more acquaintances.", "This means a lot to me, thank you. After the day I've had, I really needed to hear that. Thank you \u2665\ufe0f\n\n>And most grown women don't tolerate that crap for a second\n\nAll of my girl friends have literally said this lmao apparently one of them told her last night to tone down on the \"Regina George\" cosplay", "You are SO WELCOME!!!!
