I wouldn\u2019t take on a friend/family member/etc of a patient I currently had- too many unethical situations can pop up. Your therapist may have suggestions of other therapists in the area for your friend though!! But not seeing the same therapist is the best, most ethical idea. \n\nNTA", "NAH - if only there was someone you could talk to about this. A professional that you already had a professional relationship with.", "Hmm NAH but please reconsider. It is SO HARD to fine a good therapist", "NAH.\n\nI don't think your friend asking for your therapist's information is a breach of privacy in itself. If you've expressed that this therapist is working for you, then perhaps they are just hoping they would have the same success with said therapist.\n\nIt's also totally fine for you to not feel comfortable having the same therapist as your friend. You don't have to give her their information. There are hundreds of other therapists out there.", "INFO - Why do you feel uncomfortable?  The therapist cannot talk about anything related to you.  They'll lose their license for breaking confidentiality.\n\nAlso - I had an awesome therapist during my divorce and I recommend him to everyone who needs any sort of therapy, including close friends, so I find this a bit odd honestly.", "NTA, it would be a conflict of interests of sorts. Your therapist may know others who could help your friend but if I were you I\u2019d talk with my therapist about to find out how she/he/they would handle the situation and tell your friend that one thing about therapy is that the therapist is a completely unbiased and unconnected individual. It doesn\u2019t mean you talking about your friend in therapy (although there is nothing wrong with that) it means the therapist is able to give you the best therapy without having the thoughts in their head of another patient who may be affected. An easy example is if patient A wants a girls weekend at an expensive resort and person B can\u2019t go for whatever reason the therapist is able to advise based on the best interests of their patient without thinking about how much person A will be hurt without person B there or how much person B would have to give up to afford going. My ex and I have the same psychiatrist, who deals with our meds, it was fine when we were married but now that we are not it feels odd going for my appointments.", "NTA. I'm not particularly good at explaining why it would make me feel awkward, but it would feel weird to me too.", "NTA. I feel like if you go to the same one, there will be a natural conversation between you and your friend because it\u2019s something else you have in common. I understand why you would want to keep it separate.", "NTA and I can almost guarantee you that your therapist wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with that either. Maybe try asking your therapist for a list of other recommendations that you can give to your friend.", "NTA. I would never ever want this", "NAH We all have our hangs and this is yours apparently. You're not obliged to share the information with your friend much as your therapist is bound to not share any of your details with your friend.

Here's the deal, a good therapist will not even admit that you are a patient there. A good therapist will not compare or provide insight from your sessions to support them or vice versa. A good therapist will keep you safe. \n\nI have a kid who's seeing a therapist that a co-worker is seeing. They don't even acknowledge each other and the therapist hasn't mentioned them knowing each other. This is not something to worry about.\n\nBut you also would not be the AH if you simply didn't. Its all about your comfort too.", "NAH. Youre allowed to feel however you want. If youre concerned its a conflict of interest, why not address it with your therapist, and see if they can offer some alternate therapists for your friend to see. They might also be able to help you figure out how to address this feeling without ruining your friendship.", "NTA for not giving her your therapist's info. You don't have to do that.

What if she had done research and decided to see your therapist without realizing he was treating you too?", "NTA\u2014 your therapist would likely refuse to see her anyway because it\u2019s a conflict of interest.

She asked for recommendations, and I talked about it to my therapist. \n\nMy therapist asked if I was comfortable with her treating my friend. Before I answered she gave me several alternatives, such as referring her to someone else in the office, referring her to a colleague at a totally different office, or explaining how to find reputable providers in her network. \n\nIt can feel like someone encroaching on a safe space to share a therapist with a loved one.

How do you have a BEST (i.e. closest) friend, and a quality therapeutic relationship, and never have the former come up during the latter? Seems . . . odd.

Being uncomfortable is okay. You are a resilient, complex person who will not be mentally crushed by being uncomfortable.\n\nI think giving this much decision-making power to a minor misgiving fuels anxiety rather than healing it. One thing a good therapist will encourage you to do is apply reasonable skepticism to your emotions before deciding they reflect external reality. That\u2019s what\u2019s at the heart of CBT and DBT, which are the best research-based therapies we have: coming to recognize that often even very strong distress can be successfully reframed by the individual. This seems like quite minor distress, and maybe reframing would solve the problem. \n\nIt sounds like your friend is in need, and a good therapist is hard to come by. I mean this question sincerely, but why *not* do her a favor and just let yourself feel a little privately uncomfortable? It\u2019s a kindness to someone else when no clear harm is evident.

I guess in a small town in might be unavoidable, but even in a small city, that's super unethical and I would find it really problematic. It's too difficult for a therapist to retain genuine objectivity and therapeutic distance when they are likely to end up hearing the same issues/arguments from multiple perspectives/people.

I'm not a psychologist, but maybe because you build up a relationship with a therapist, a relationship that doesn't involve anyone else (of course because the sessions are private and everything is kept confidential).

Your therapy is your safe space and between two people only. Whilst the therapist is legally bound to stay confidential, if you and your friend had a dispute and expressed this during therapy sessions, it could subconsciously impact on impartiality and may result indirectly in getting a lesser quality service.

Of course, this is just an example out of many disputes which are possible between friends, and hopefully would never happen to you but it was the first example I could think of to illustrate a conflict of interest.\n\nIf you want to be helpful to your friend, you could contact your therapist to see if they have any therapists you could recommend, so that you could provide a reputable therapist to your friend. I guarantee all therapists have other people they can recommend as it is normal for professionals to network.", "Psychological ethics dictates that they cannot see your friend as it could lead to a conflict of interest", "NTA. I am currently seeing a therapist recommended to me by a close friend when I was going through some really tough times. My therapist is wonderful, but I do have that extra awareness if I feel like venting about my friend, and there are uncomfortable moments when we seem to communicate our mutual concern for my friend through euphemisms or half-phrases. I think your concerns are valid, not that they should be discussing you (a blatant violation of HIPAA) but it can add a layer of awkwardness to a process which is supposed to be solely focused on helping you.", "YTA.  Stop gatekeeping the therapist!", "NTA. Word of mouth is how a lot of them operate. If they are good, it won't matter who they see. The second I know so and so comes up in a session. A change of subject or you need another therapist.  HIPAA rules", "That\u2019s actually interesting to know. I know that there is a therapist in my town that both my bosses and multiple of my coworkers go to and I always wonder what she thinks about our hell hole of a restaurant because I know they just complain about each other and I wondered how hard it I would be to deal with confidentiality.", "My employee assistance program contracts with a limited number of therapists so I imagine my coworkers and I see the same people", "Unconscious bias exists, even for professionals. People who are aware they exist often do their best to avoid them, but they still happen. It's ok to be uncomfortable, and it's a great idea to bring it up to your therapist. They may even be able to recommend a colleague that they feel would be a good resource for your friend.", "I would ask your therapist if they know any other good therapists in the area they would recommend and give your friend those details. \n\nIt is perfectly valid to not want to have the same therapist as your best friend. A lot of therapists would refuse to take on a client under those circumstances anyway.", "I suspected that\u2019s how you were feeling but didn\u2019t know how to put it into words. I feel like a lot of people jumped on you for being \u201cselfish\u201d to want to keep your therapist to yourself. But I think that\u2019s really unfair to say you can\u2019t keep your safe space for yourself. Therapy is so personal and and private and vulnerable. It\u2019s perfectly OK if you need that space just for you.", "NTA. Depending on how small your area is, it could be unavoidable. However, just because your therapist works for you, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re compatible with your friend. Maybe suggest a previous therapist or ask your therapist for recommendations even to give to your friend. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable either. Just a sense of security thing.", "YTA. You want to deprive your friend of a good therapist when there are so few available.", "Multiple therapists have already commented and pointed out why it\u2019s a bad idea", "It isn't industry wide. I have patients who were referred to me by other patients. However,  these are situations where a current/former patient willingly referred someone to me/the practice to which I belong. I will not see a spouse/ex of a current/former pt.", "It's not \"industry wide\" and it's not explicitly against our ethical code. But I think (hope) that most of us would definitely refuse to see close friends or family members of a current client. In rural or underserved areas, as has been pointed out, choices may be limited so the therapist in that situation would have to be very careful and I'd hope that they would seek out clinical supervision in order to keep relationships and boundaries crystal clear.\n\nIf there were any choice at all, though, the decision to refer friends/family/colleagues to another therapist is best for all involved.", "Depends on the situation. Best practice is to not see anyone who knows each other. But sometimes situations happen where it's best for the clients that they both see you. I'm one of the only LGBTQ therapists in my area that is both taking clients and seeing them in person, so there can be overlap. It can involve some detailed discussions about what we'll do if certain issues crop up. In one case where two clients knew each other it was agreed that if they needed to talk about anything related to each other, a colleague would handle it, while I focused on their gender identity stuff", "Talking to a therapist can lead anywhere and it might lead to talking about your friend who is seeing the same therapist.  You might reveal something that your friend didn't want revealed, or inadvertently effect the therapist's view of your friend's issue or your own. There are other ways it could get messy, so I expect it would be best to just avoid the situation when possible.", "[removed]", "What do you think is going to happen if she sees the same therapist", "Downvote and report. /u/Technfh is a bot and stole this comment from /u/PreferenceHungry8181", "Lol so OP *must* give her friend the name of her therapist? OP has no choice here? It\u2019s only for the therapist to decide?"]}
