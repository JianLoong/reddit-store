You didn't actually uninvite your aunt. Rather, she's from a different time, so it is physics that prevents her from attending your wedding.", "NTA. She blatantly expressed disapproval of your marriage to your face, and then invented drama over the dress that your daughter didn't even want to wear. Why does she even want to come to your wedding if she feels so strongly opposed to gay marriage? I suspect that if you relent and let her come she will just create more drama at your wedding. She clearly wants to ruin your day. Don't let her. Stick to your guns and don't let your aunt anywhere near your wedding.", "Nta, when someone tells you she from a different time bs. Tell them you are from this time and we no longer support bigots. So they can\u2019t blame you since you are from this time", "I was born in the 1950\u2019s and that doesn\u2019t give me license to be an AH.\n\nYou handled this situation perfectly.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nCan I also just say I absolutely LOVE that you found a way to make sure your cousin still got a dress she loved and gets to come.", "NTA. You don't have to have any homophobes at your wedding, and you should feel free to uninvite anyone who is defending your aunt's shitty bigotry.", "Nta my grandma from a different time also.

Good call.", "I'm 41 and I'm pretty sure others born in the early 80's would agree it's nothing to do with \"being from a  different time\" (which doesn't even make sense) it's about a disgusting attitude. \n\nGood riddance to your aunt, you and your stb wife will have a better day without her and her ridiculous opinions.", "NTA and congratulations on your engagement and on standing up for yourself so unapologetically. Have a wonderful wedding!", "NTA\n\nIt was never about the dress & Macy confirmed that. Your aunt was trying to ruin your wedding. Macy didn\u2019t even want to wear a white dress, but her mother was trying to force her to to participate in some kind of silent protest of your wedding. Your aunt is unethical & immoral treating both her daughter & you like this. She has expressed this is all about her disapproving of your wedding, you & your fianc\u00e9e, and pushing her homophobic agenda any way she can at your wedding. \n\nTell people very clearly she was never uninvited over a dress. She was uninvited for calling you & your future wife immoral and you only want people who bring love & support to your wedding, not hate.", "100% NTA and good for you for standing up for yourself!! I hope you have a wonderful wedding free of bigotry.", "Also, um, OP's aunt was born in 1980 or 81, and would have grown up in mostly the 90s. That's not \"a different time\".", ">\"She's from a different time\" doesn't apply\n\nThis is true, doubly so because the aunt is very likely less than 50 - she was most likely  born in the 1970's, not the 1870's!\n\nAnd OP is NTA, neither is her mom or her cousin.", "Good on you for contacting macy and not just taking aunt at her word, OP.", "It doesn't apply then either tbh. Not every single person in the 1700's was in favor of chattel slavery, many knew then, just as we know now, that it was immoral, inhumane, evil even. The fact is Washington was a real person with real flaws, and one of those flaws was that he thought it was acceptable to own human beings as property.\n\nWe don't have to make excuses for it. We can just recognize the good things he did and recognize the bad things he did.", "I was born in the late 50's and understand that no matter what time you are in hate is hate. And don't wear white to a wedding when both beautiful brides will be wearing it.", "youre right, i shouldve been more clear in the title. i wrote it like that because it started with the dress, but thats my bad, i apologize! thank you for your support it means a lot:))", "Right?? This woman isn\u2019t some great grandmother who grew up in the Bible Belt in the 50\u2019s- she a millennial for fucks sake.", "TheGays (TM) \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23.

You need to hire security, OP.  Friends or relatives might give in to her bs.  Hire a pro.\n\nNTA", "I think you meant immoral, but I am loving the idea of aunt being jealous of these willowy immortal lesbian faeries... I think I might write a short story...", "Just tell them you are not inviting any time travelers. It\u2019s a long commute from the 1800s.", "OP, if you like Macy, which it seems like you do, please keep in regular contact! She has shit views being thrown around at home and could use a good role model", "Just realised aunt is 42 how is that from another time?! Yeah she\u2019s just homophobic.", "Born in the 70s and I hate that \"a different time\"-scam of excuse. Ignorance and prejudice has been a choice for many decades by now.\n\nEdit: spelling", "lol my dad was born in 1946, in a deeply Roman Catholic family. And my Dad loved and protected his best friend, who had no family who would claim him back when being gay was more likely to get you killed. \nYou are never too old to realize you\u2019ve been taught wrong, and become a better person", "Yeah I was born in 81 and this is utter crap.  Unless you're a bride you do not wear white to a wedding.   At least not in mainstream American culture. \n\nAlso think it's nuts they weren't even dresses that the 15 yo cousin liked", "Aunt is 42 so born in 1980 or 81 depending on when her birthday is", "My thought exactly! Halfway through was like I bet the niece doesn\u2019t actually care\u2026", "My 69 year old straight ass isn't giving the aunt any slack either.

Really? You somehow managed to miss all the progress the rest of us made in the last 40-50 years? That not being from a different era, that\u2019s just being a bigot who can\u2019t change with the times!", "I am over 65. \u201cIt was a different time\u201d is complete bullshit. Maybe, just maybe you could have said that about my grandmother, who was born in 1889.

I just about died when they said she was born the same Era as me. I am not from a different time. This is my time."]}
