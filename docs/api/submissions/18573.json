My extremely Catholic grandparents (like, photos of the pope on the wall, rosaries every night, church 2-3 times a week) didn't say Jack shit about my cousin coming out and marrying her wife, they were front row at her wedding, and they loved them and their son so much that they named him after my grandpa. \n\nBeing old isn't an excuse for bigotry. Being religious isn't an excuse for bigotry. Aunt is straight up an asshole and it's good to see that her daughter isn't buying into her BS", "Oh thank fuck someone said this.  \"Everyone back then thought slavery was okay.\" Um no, there were whole swathes of people that didn't think it was okay; including, but not limited to, the actual slaves!!", "If that wasn't a typo, I love it. If it was a typo, I still love it!", "If its so immoral and a problem why does she even WANT to be there? And why would she want her daughter in white to look like shes also marrying yall?  Bizarre thought process!", "Aunt is a Millenial as is OP. Literally OP and her aunt are considered to be the same geration albeit at opposite ends, so OP if anyone tries to tell you aunt is from a different time you can lead with this fact, signed a 44 year old Gen Xer. \n\nNTA.", "No, youre a bot.", "OPs aunt is literally you her than my mom and my mom would never pull this shit. This isn't \"a different time\" thing, this is Main Character Syndrome", "My 89-y.o. grandmother (of blessed memory) was a devout Catholic. If she was able to accept gay people as they are, a woman half her age can. \n\nI hope you have a lovely wedding and that your niece enjoys herself.", "100% and NTA for Team baby pink dress. Sadly some bigotry is timeless, they'll say whatever words they want to justify it.", "Not to mention it\u2019s strange they even brought up slavery and racism in the first place. Like stay on topic lol.", "Gossip fodder. Come on, a gay wedding would have given her things to have the vapors about with her friends for weeks!", "My gramma was also born early 20\u2019s and when one son came out as gay and my daughter came out as transgender, her response was, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. They were born that way.\u201d  \n\nHer acceptance and love meant so much. She was affectionately nicknamed Gramma Gaga because of it.", "I was Born in the mid 70s, and I've been with my partner for almost 25 years now, we're both women. Auntie can blow her bullshit out her arse. Different era my ass.", "We live in 2023. How is this a different time?\n\nAnd\u2026 have these people MET the 1960s? When the parents of people born in the 70s were adults & had sex?", "Perhaps, but judging by how my grandmother was, times had changed somewhat by 1920. No one under 120 years old gets to use the \u201cfrom a different time\u201d excuse anymore.", "Yeah, my grandfather was born 189?. When I hear a sentence like \"he really struggled with the fact that due to his bad health, at some point his wife was the main breadwinner, it was a different time\", I can accept that. That was a different time.", "I think my grandma would have been respectful of my being not cishet (Appalachia does weird things to folks) while not fully wrapping her head around it, unfortunately it didn't pass down to all my aunts and uncle. My uncle absolutely refused to speak to me the 3 days he was around for the spreading of my aunt's ashes (he also didn't speak to my lesbian cousin, the daughter of whose ashes we were spreading).  \n  \nMy grandpa would have been absolutely chill with it though, between WW2 and the Battle of Athens, man was a contrarian to the day he died, anytime bigots would push back on him he'd just double down.", "\u201cBack in my days, we did [whatever]. And I'm still alive, so it's still my days, so I'm gonna do [whatever].\u201d\n\nActually valid, IMO, as long as the [whatever] isn't some stupid bigoted shit. (We knew that bigoted shit was stupid even in the 70s.)", "Absolutely agree. My parents were born in the 1920s. They knew better.", "Your grandparents sound amazing.", "As I said, Appalachia does weird things to folks (or did, at least, lots of assholes moving in pricing folks out), folks may have talked shit behind your back (about literally anything, my dad's family is still talking shit about my brother taking his car to a shop to get his oil changed years ago) but are mostly respectful to your face. There's this big biker I know, says some of the most transphobic shit I've heard that wasn't on the internet, he laid out some dude for calling a local transwoman (emphasis on local) \"a man in a dress.\""]}
