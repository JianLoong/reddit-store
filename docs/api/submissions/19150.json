We do not share the cost of the parties.\n\nWhat you do at your House is up to you, what thwy do at there house  is up to them.\nYou do not need to pay for a party that they are hosting at their house that has nothing to do with you. \n\nLet them kick off but at the end of the day that's like them asking for you to pay for their holiday coa the child is going. \nWhat they decide to do whilst rhwy are in their care is up to them, nothing to do with you or your finances.", "NTA. She wants the party to be a certain way, so she can pay for it.", "Nta\n\nCompletely fair for each of you to throw, and more importantly pray for, your own parties.", "NTA.  Her party. Her problem.  You're paying the maintenance you're supposed to pay.  Throw your party for your child and she can figure out her own sh&$.", "NTA, she can use her support payments to pay for her party, you are under no obligation, legally or morally, to pay for a party none of your people are allowed to go to.", "NTA. I don't know how people normally handle this in divorces, but what you say here sounds reasonable. You were originally hoping it could be more of a joint party; and you told her ahead of time that you were doing your own party so she could plan to do something within her own budget -- so her outrage here seems misplaced.", "NTA. Your ex is very happy to throw parties on your dime. If you are paying for the party for your son you should get a say on the planning and invites. Throwing your own party is a great solution, and you can and should invite his school friends too.\n\n\nBut you should talk to your attorney.

If she isn't willing to have a joint party then she shouldn't expect joint pay.", "NTA. She has no problems throwing these parties when it's your money, and got used to that added bonus money on top of child maintenance.

At least you tried.\n\nIf you don't invite them, it potentially becomes ammo for your exes continued pettiness.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, the friend group he has now may not  be the same friend group he has a few years down the road. The parents of some of those future friends may not be the type to join cliques like your ex is in. They might accept cause they don't care to play those games.\n\nThey might even be people you'd mesh well with. Continuing to extend invites regardless of the response may pay off dividends down the road.", "NTA. Invite all his friends to both parties.

Not your fault if his school friends choose not to come both parties.", "Easy to see why she\u2019s an ex.", "Yep, this. And if she made sure to write/text that you aren't invited, that harms her in court. You're not in any danger provided that you're following the decree.\n\nOP: disengage, communicate only in writing, create and hold firm boundaries which align with your decree, and if you need it, seek a little therapy to learn new tools for navigating communicating with her (and what she might be teaching the kiddo). You can do this.", "Good\n\nGlad to hear you aren't playing her game\n\nJust continue to document the violent and angry outbursts....and continue to provide a loving and caring home for your kid.

Don't pay for her to throw her party.\n\nYour comments indicate this is a common issue where she over steps for money. She's an ex for a reason."]}
