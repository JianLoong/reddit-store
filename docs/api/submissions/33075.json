My sister knows about my financial struggles, but she's convinced that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for all of us.  \nI've tried explaining my situation to her, but she insists that I should prioritize her big day and make the necessary sacrifices. My parents are pressuring me as well, saying that family comes first and that I should find a way to make it work.\n\nThe thing is, I feel like i'm being backed into a corner, I understand that weddings are special occasions, but I can't help but think it's unfair for my sister to expect me to spend money i simply don't have. Moreover, I don't want to start my married life (yes, i'm engaged too)  with additional financial stress.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for considering skipping my sister's destination wedding due to financial constraints, or should i suck it up and find a way to make it work for the sake of the family unity?", "created_utc": 1702647407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j09fj/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters/", "score": 743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
