He can enjoy a romantic getaway with his friend\u2014 it sounds like that\u2019s what he wants anyways.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t respect you. Keep that in mind going forward.", "NTA.  He unilaterally changed the trip.  You are entitled to decide you no longer wish to go. \n\nAnd I really hope he isn\u2019t expecting you to be comfortable sharing a bed with him with someone else five feet away.", "NTA. How is it a romantic getaway if there is someone else snoring in the next bed/sofa...????", "NTA.  Definitely.  If it was intended to be a romantic getaway then I don't know how that can be achieved with a friend coming along.  Unless he has other ideas about the \"friendship\"", "NTA- the friend can get their own hotel room.", "NTA One does not have a \u201cromantic getaway\u201d when there is a third wheel  coming along. This isn\u2019t you and your BFF going traveling-this is the person you have sex with\u2026 going to a place many people think is synonymous with romance. \n\nYour BF wants his friend to sleep on the sofa or another bed *in the same room*? In what world would this be even remotely a good idea?\n\nWTF is wrong with your BF.\n\nIs your BF that clueless or does he want a threesome?  Well, now he can just go with his buddy.", "NTA  \nhe should have talked to you first before inserting his friend into your planed trip together.", "NTA I can\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t see the problem. April in Paris with a friend on the pull out sounds un-fun.", "NTA..... wow I am so sorry!  This is not okay.  I am thinking you aren't in the kind of relationship you think you are.  To think you would be okay sleeping with your boyfriend in a room with one of his \"bro's\" is wrong.  Especially without telling you.  Especially throwing money in your face.  And sleeping in the same room with a guy you aren't involved with..... ick.  \n\n I don't think you are being ridiculous, if he wants to go on a romantic vacay with his bro..... so be it.", "NTA - if anyone is being manipulative it\u2019s him. \n\ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\n\nNothing screams 'romance' like someone you never met before crashing in on your vacation? I'm not sure what the BF is thinking but he most certainly should have told you.\n\nChoose between you and his friend? I'm fairly certain he knew it was going to be a *romantic getaway* and, well, I'm assuming he's not romantically invested in his friend here.", "NTA. He called this a romantic getaway, but how is it going to be romantic with his friend in your hotel room???", "NTA \n\nIt's not a romantic getaway if there's a 3rd person there. He says the friend will do his own thing apart from you, but you know that won't happen. Bf should have asked you if his friend could come before he invited another person to join you.", "NTA\n\nThe petty part of me would go and pay an unusual amount of attention to the friend and only give yes or no answers to the BF.\n\nOnly do that if you want to burn down the relationship.", "Lol he says your manipulative while literally throwing in your face how he gets to make the decisions since he paid for it?? NTA but hopefully this will be your ex bf soon", "NTA. Just because he paid for most of the trip doesnt mean he gets to just majorly change plans without discussing it with you first.", "NTA\n\nYou were promised a romantic getaway, not shared quarters like a teenager in a hostel. I would 100% be telling them the same thing.\n\nActually no, I'd be telling them that I'm still going to France, and that it's up to him whether or not we'll be in separate hotels.", "Ah, yes, nothing is more romantic than going to France with your significant other AND their friend.. \n\nNTA.", "WTF NTA.\n\nHow is he not going to bother you while sleeping in the same freaking room?? That would def crimp some romantic French-themed sex. \n\nYou are absolutely in the right for not going. Wish them \"bon voyage\" and take that time to do some reflection, or go someplace else!", "NTA - I\u2019d still go, but only if the friend has his own room.", "This vacation sounds like he\u2019s designing it to see more than one \u201cEiffel Tower.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019ll show myself out.  NTA.", "What is up with all the BFs lately, bringing their besties to trips they are supposed to be taking with their partners? \n\nMaybe he's just a little obtuse? Try and spell it out to him that you planned on fucking him and ask him if he'd like his friend to watch? Maybe to join in? Maybe the penny will drop.", "Nta sure he can invite his friend but you aren't his slave that he can order to attend.", "NTA. There's no way in hell this is going to be a \"romantic\" trip if the friend is even going to be sharing their room.", "NTA\u2026I wouldn\u2019t go\u2026", "NTA\n\nI know a lot of people might tell you to just go and be petty and make the friend uncomfortable but don\u2019t do that. You really need to think about what this means for your relationship. Do not go on that trip. If he\u2019s already paid for it, let them go. You should take time to determine if this is something you really want going forward and if his excuse of \u201cI paid for it so I decide how it goes\u201d is far. This won\u2019t end here, I can promise you that.", "Why would the friend want to sleep in a room with a couple, eww lmao", "NTA.\n\nYou agreed to go on a romantic getaway, not a buddy trip.", "It sounds like it could potentially be a romantic trip. It's just not the type you signed up for. If he  goes without you, then use that as your answer.", "NTA and this other guy should take the trip with his actual Boyfriend.", "NTA - what part of a trip with his random friend sleep right on the other side of your bed screams romance??\n\nHe\u2019s right. He can invite who he want since he\u2019s bankrolling, but an invite isn\u2019t a summons. \n\nHe presented a trip to you, that is really no longer the initially stated trip, aka you didn\u2019t agree to this.\n\nI think you really need to reflect on what kind of human being you\u2019re with, who would make a big decision about plans you already both have in motion and then just expect you to accept things and get upset when you don\u2019t. He made an offering to you of a romantic trip, and is now mad that you have a reaction to the change.\n\nLet he and his buddy enjoy the romantic trip, since it\u2019s **so** important that he go.", "I had an ex do this EXACT same thing.

You are not a pet or his child so he does not get to decide for you.
