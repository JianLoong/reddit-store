He doesn't respect you.. leave his sorry butt", "Are you paying for any of it?", "NTA \n\n>changing our hotel room to a room with 2 beds or his friend would sleep on the sofa. \n\nReal hard to feel romantic when there's a third wheel in the room. Also, his claim that paying for the trip means he can do what he wants gives me an iffy feeling. Is that something he says a lot?", "If your ticket is already paid for, tell him to invite another of his friends and you'll stay home. How inconsiderate!\n\nEdit: I screwed up and deleted half of my comment", "NTA. If you want, go on the trip and see some cool new sights, but you should probably drop him when you get back. He clearly doesn\u2019t respect you or your relationship.\n\nMy husband and I have gone on trips with friends, but we always know that ahead of time, and we have never, ever slept in the same room as them. Eww.", "NTA - But ultimatums don\u2019t help anyone. Even if your bf chooses you, you still had to threaten him to get your way. Either tell your boyfriend that you aren\u2019t going to France or go and try to make the best of the trip.", "NTA", "NTA. If you don't want to go, don't go.", "NTA. \n\nClearly, his idea of a romantic getaway involves himself, his girlfriend, and a third wheel.", "He is making choices about your own plans without any input from you. I would tell him he can enjoy his entitlement as a single person. I will have a say about all things that involve me 100% of the time. His misogyny is showing. NTA.", "NTA, look what your boyfriend is showing you.... if he pays, he feels he has a right not to be considerate of your feelings.", "And how can you have a \"romantic getaway\" with someone in the same room? A romantic getaway should have some sex, unless the couple doesn't prefer it. Most do.", "Of course not! She gets her own bed while her BF and his friend share one.", "The threesome idea occurred to me as a motivation for bf's behavior as well.", "Romantic getaway to France, sudden friend invited along, france has the Eiffel Tower, Eiffel Tower is also a sex-term for threesomes where a man is on both ends of the woman and then high fives.  \n\n\nHonestly the writing is on the wall, but i dont know if its on purpose or just a coincidence\u2026", "This!", "I was 1k up vote. Go me\n\n\nAbsolutely right. Personally I have a kid tons of friends( too fucking many) and a wife. If I get any goddamn moment for just us two I take it without a hesitation and no I don't give a shit if your dream is to see France figure it out on your own goddamn dime I wanna be buckass naked with my wife in my hotel every damn second I can. Not a single friend of mine will take that away.", "Definitely this.\n\nNo respect given. All respect wanted.", "He sounds like a kid...how old are you guys?", "I was 1k up vote. Go me\n\n\nAbsolutely right. Personally I have a kid tons of friends( too fucking many) and a wife. If I get any goddamn moment for just us two I take it without a hesitation and no I don't give a shit if your dream is to see France figure it out on your own goddamn dime I wanna be buckass naked with my wife in my hotel every damn second I can. Not a single friend of mine will take that away.", "Stay!!!! You're helping the OP prove multiple points for the OP, against the \"BF\"!!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "This person got it all.  I was going to point out the throwing in \"he paid for it\" part because that's what your life will look like.  He paid for it so he can do what he wants with it.  Bad enough he invited his friend along, but then to bring up that he paid for the trip to start with.\n\nSo either he doesn't want the romance or he wants his friend to join, or this is a very good glimpse of what your future will be like with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Also the friend might be most clueless person ever if he's even considering third wheeling on a couple's trip to Paris.", "hehehe. You said inserting...", "OP, I agree you're NTA. I just wanted to chime in here to say: If you get your own hotel room, get it far from them and don't tell them where you're staying. He would probably turn up thinking everything is fine and he saved his friend money on the hotel room.", "*Au contraire*, there is one French-themed position the boyfriend might have in mind: *La Tour Eiffel*.", "Indeed, imagine what a potential honeymoon would be like.", "You spelled \"own holiday\" wrong.\n\nA romantic getaway involves more that staying in a hotel. Imaging having a romantic dinner with that friend sitting at the same table (or next table staring at you) as well. Or having a nice walk along the Seine with the friend training behind. No thanks.", "I'd actually have some safety concerns with going,  especially with bf throwing around the \"i paid for the trip\" card. That gives him the ability to cancel the flight home. Also...two guys in a room with a woman are definitely going to be stronger than the woman.", "Thank you, I have been waiting for this comment", "You're definitely OPs bf lmao\nThat's creepy af, man", "LOL. Yeah, I'm sure there are just hordes of women dying to share a hotel room with this dude and his bro for a 'romantic getaway'.", "Why are you acting like OP's BF is such a catch that she ought to just bow to his will. They had a romantic trip planned to France, a very intimate thing to go on. The BF then decided you know what, OP might as well third-wheel since this guy BF knows would love to go to. Total disregard to OP there. Yet, BF is a catch, amirite?", ">little romantic moments and possible getaways with you while on the trip\n\nUnless one of those \"getaways\" is getting a different hotel room, your comment is bullshit.  I would NOT want to share a room with one of my husband's friends, romantic getaway or not.  Sharing a room and a bathroom with another man would be hugely awkward.  Some \"romantic getaway\" if you can't even have sex because some extra dude in your room \ud83d\ude44", "After what the SO pulled, I wouldn't trust ANYTHING he had to say about the friend getting his own room.  Given everything else he's pulled, I wouldn't put it past him to SAY the friend got his own room, then it gets conveniently \"cancelled\" at the last moment and, since there are \"no other rooms available\" so he HAS to stay in the same room as them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Sounds like it'll be the three of you together the whole time. NTA", "Was he going to offer you up to his friend because his friend hasn't had sex lately and it would be a good idea for you to show him a good time.", "Maybe the boyfriend is hoping the friend can join them?  Definitely seems that way!", "It's imagined to be a romantic getaway if you want a threesome with your partner and bestfriend. \n\nNot that I really suspect that, but OTOH it's such a totally bizarre thing to do in the first place that I can't even.", "BF bi? Wants throuple?", "Ew. Yuck.", "That", "Just upvote if you don't have anything to add, my dude", "Something OP\u2019s boyfriend won\u2019t be doing. \n\nWell, actually, maybe he will", "I am not googling that. Haha.", ">he\u2019s always wanted to see France so my boyfriend thought he would be kind\n\n\"Why are you mad? You said he's always wanted to see France. We're taking about what to see in France. I'm just being kind!\"\n\nMake the bf rue the day he dreamed up this boneheaded move.", "To not even discuss this at all with the OP is just not cool. Having to share a bedroom for a romantic getaway is sketchy as heck too. I definitely don\u2019t know the whole picture, but it sounds like she is marginalized in this relationship.", "Or the BF's friend. Either way, terrible take on their end.", "Haha if he\u2019s paying for it, what is she griping about? Yeah, he\u2019s a dick for saying it would be a romantic getaway but he likely didn\u2019t specify \u201cjust the two of them\u201d. It was a misunderstanding but she should still appreciate the trip.", "Sounds like their friend wanted to go to France but cut on his trip costs. \n\nI mean if the friend had their own room and didn't bother the couple....then they could have gone on on their own anytime.", "Thank you, comments that just say \"this\" are absolutely useless and shouldn't be typed out at all.\n\nI\"ll be awaiting the \"clever\" person that writes \"this\" as a reply to my comment.", "Word.", "The other", "At the very least, yeah.", "How is any getaway with a third-wheel a romantic one? How is sharing a room with another individual conducive to romance and intimacy?\n\nAlso, money does not make one a catch. A good career is a positive, but most women I know look for other qualities in a man over money.", "A romantic getaway where someone else shares your bedroom is not a misunderstanding.", "Syllable", "Noun", "Subjective participle", "Onomatopoeia"]}
