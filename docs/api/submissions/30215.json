We are having a super intimate ceremony (only my mom and stepdad, his parents, and siblings) and then a reception after. \n\nTo sum up a very long story, when I was 14, my step mom was terrible to me. She ridiculed and bullied me. When I asked my dad to help he refused, saying he didn\u2019t want to fight with his wife so I had to deal with it on my own. I moved out of his house at 15 because of how miserable I was, and we haven\u2019t had much of a relationship ever since. My grandparents were also super judgmental of me around the same time, and I haven\u2019t had much of a relationship with them either and haven\u2019t spoken to them in years. They now all live in the same house.\n\n I took my dad to therapy recently and have been trying to mend my relationship with him, but we\u2019re still struggling. I decided I would invite only him to my wedding, and only to the reception, like most of our guests. \n\nNow I am hearing through my sister that he is upset because he is only invited to the ceremony, his wife isn\u2019t invited, and the grandparents aren\u2019t invited.

He failed you when you were a kid and chose his wife over your relationship with him. Now he has to deal with the consequences of those actions", "It is your wedding, so who you invite or do not invite is your call.\n\nNTA.\n\nI have to ask this.  Is it kind of a red flag you are trying to repair your relationship with your dad, but he can not talk directly to you about an issue, and instead goes through your sister?  Maybe this should be a topic to discuss at the next therapy session.", "NTA - And to be honest, I probably wouldn't invite your dad. Seems like it's too soon to do so and your guys relationship isn't really fixed yet. The last thing you want is drama during your big day.", "Nta. Go no contact with all of them.  Your father clearly doesn't think what you went through was a big deal.", "NTA. Though, if it were me, I would disinvite the dad. I feel like he\u2019ll bring everyone along against your wishes and just create trouble on the wedding day itself. Or hire security \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nYour day, your decision. This belief that you should do such and such just due to tradition and blood is archaic and hold no bearing on how people really live their lives. Have a good day and tell your dad to -FINALLY- grow a backbone. Urgently.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry to tell you this but your relationship with your dad is over. I know you likely want a relationship with him, but for your own sake drop him. He hasn\u2019t changed and once again he\u2019s choosing other people and their feelings over you.", "NTA, I'm actually surprised you still invited your dad. A wedding is a time for people to celebrate you and your mate and show their support and good wishes. It wouldn't make any sense to invite people who haven't been kind to you, even cruel. It's a reflection of their behavior. It is not up to you to risk more attitude and ill treatment.", "Nta, they hurt you and you dont have to invite them. There's nothing wrong with a small wedding, if dad has a problem he doesn't have to go.", "Tell him you did it because you didn't want to fight with his wife", "Nta hes a stranger to you know he doesn't deserve to be at the intimate ceremony if he couldn't step up to be a father when you needed him. He's acting like a bad father talking behind your back now. I would message him and tell him his past actions is what mad this situation you still want him to be there on your day but your relationship is not at the point where you feel comfortable with him at the ceremony. Regarding your step mom and grand parents tell him you don't want a relationship with them they never treated you well and don't want to deal with them on your special day.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules, your choice. Inviting them would only cause more drama and make your special day terrible.", "NTA. Your dad is a loser. None of them would receive an invite in my books. They can all be and stay miserable in the house they reside in. Congratulations btw! Your wedding, your day, your happiness!", "NTA, just disinvite your dad so step mumsy won\u2019t be alone. Why are you trying to mend fences? Reap what you sew.", "NTA. Same family situation here. My dad\u2019s wife is a raging\u2026 you know what\u2026 and always makes rude comments when I\u2019m around/my dad always has her back and doesn\u2019t care that she says and does the things she does. I wouldn\u2019t want that at my future wedding either! IMO you avoided a great deal of drama aside from what you are dealing with. Screw em!", "NTA - I personally would rethink dads invitation, clearly he is still an AH", "NTA - your wedding, if they dont like it then too bad. Maybe you'd have invited them if they treated you nicely", "Absolutely not.", "NTA. It's your special day, and you have the right to invite whoever you want. Your stepmom and grandparents treated you poorly, so it's understandable that you don't want them there. Your dad should have talked to you directly instead of going through your sister.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s your wedding and you have every right to not invite a woman who has so negatively impacted your life. \n\nWith that said, If you ever want to repair your relationship with your father, you need to tolerate your step mother.  My stepmother is a crazy bitch.  But I never let her get in the way of my relationship with my Dad. \n\nShe was mad at me for some reason after my wedding.  But I poured on the sugar.  If I called the house and she answered, I was always sweet.  Because I knew that if I wasn\u2019t then she would drive a wedge\n\nYou could take this opportunity to start fresh. \n\nStep mom- I know we have had our rocky past.  Let\u2019s all get together before the wedding for dinner and put everything behind us.  If she agrees and you can, then maybe it\u2019s a fresh start.  If she acts crazy, then you are justified in your decision.", "YTA. You invite half of a married couple. Should have not invite him. Probably he won't attend as he will get to much flack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He doesn\u2019t get a say in your happiness.", "NTA why invite him in the first place?\n\nTell him \u201cI want people that support and celebrate me.\u201d\n\nIf he wants grandparents and evil step mother attend in a traditional way, give him the bill for the wedding, so he can pay for that in the traditional way.", "NTA. \n\nYour father, step mom, and grandparents all failed you. Why invite any of them to your wedding?", "NTA. It is your wedding, you get to decide who is there or not.", "NTA. If your father can\u2019t even be bothered to help his daughter when he knows she struggling, due to someone he brought into your life then why do you have to be bothered to invite any of them. If you speak to your father explain that things might be different if he actually try to show he cared about you when you were younger. That he\u2019d rather destroy his relationship with you then rock the boat with his wife and that made you feel so insignificant and unimportant in his life and that does a lot of damage to a young girl. Ask him why after years of mental abuse do bad from your step mother, while he just allowed to happen, would he expect her to get an invite? Why does he care about your relationship now? Why is he the one that decides when you\u2019re important enough to have a relationship with? He needs to give you real answers to hard questions. He owes you at least that much.", "NTA. You want supportive people around you on your wedding day. That is not your stepmother or grandparents. You have a nonexistent relationship with them. Your father is adult and he could have spoken to you directly rather than involving your sister and putting her in the middle. He knows why they are not invited. Tell him if he doesn\u2019t quit it, he\u2019ll be uninvited.", "NTA so not the AH. and i would not even attempt to mend anything without a sincere apology", "NTA.\n\nIf he's upset that his effect can't come. Then he can just stay the F home with her. Too bad, so sad.", "Nta they were extremely hurtful and cruel to you. You don't need them in your life for anything.

I invited him because i\u2019m trying hard to make out relationship better, but i can\u2019t stand this through the grapevine nonsense.", "honestly it\u2019s one of my biggest fears that they\u2019ll all show up anyway \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t think they would, but i guess you never know", "I agree. I\u2019m trying hard to mend my relationship with my dad and not burn further bridges between us. but he\u2019s mad when he gets an invite, he\u2019d be mad if he wasn\u2019t invited at all, so i\u2019m stuck in between a rock and a hard place.", "I completely understand him wanting to stick with his wife and that technically that\u2019s kinda shitty of me, but i can\u2019t stand having her there and I didn\u2019t want to burn a bridge completely with him. If he wanted to stick by her and not come because of that I think I could understand.", "He\u2019s proving again he puts his abusive wife over you. NTA but you have to think if this relationship with your father is fixable. Will he ever change?", "I\u2019ve read so many Wedding drama posts that all of them showing up won\u2019t really shock me\u2026 better to be safe than sorry right?", "agreed"]}
