Buy her books.  You can never have too many books!\n\nBut seriously,  Reconsider.  What you are teaching her is the number of gifts is important, vs the quality of the gift.  As she gets older and gifts get more expensive, it will be hard satisfy her expectations.\n\nAlso, 5 is not too old to start teaching her the gift of giving.  Start to explain to her that some parents cannot afford a lot of gifts.

Go full Hallmark - spend the time leading up to Christmas doing family movie nights, decorate cookies, go to Christmas carols together, get matching pjs. I think you look back and see your mom happy and have equated that with lots of presents - but it\u2019s the happiness with your daughter you really want. You can absolutely find ways to start family traditions that will give her the same fond holiday memories in a way that you and your husband can BOTH feel comfortable with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband wants to be reasonable about the amount of money you spend on the gifts - also great.\n\nI think you two should have a calm conversation and find a compromise there. There's nothing wrong with spoiling the kid A BIT once or twice a year, but too much is never good. Maybe you can get just one cool thing instead of 10 mediocre ones? Maybe - as some other commenter already suggested - invest that money in kid's future instead?", "ESH\n\nYou two have a difference of opinion and need to find a compromise.\n\nMy perspective is that 10 toys seems like a lot of gifts and in reality she probably won\u2019t play with them all.  It ends up being a waste of money and about what you want.  Would all of those presents on Christmas mattered to you if your mom was happy all year?", " Buy whatever tf you want for your daughter for holidays. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong for wanting to go all out for your children.\n\nIf he wants to be an asshole about it, he can not buy anything. That\u2019s his choice, but in this case, *you* do what you want to do and he can get tf over it.\n\nNTA.", "NAH\n\nThe only concern is that this MIGHT breed high expectations for bdays and Christmas going forward so be mindful of that.", "NTA but it's important to listen to your partner before going all out. You have 10 gifts of the same type. You can be creative with other gifts so you can teach her how to appreciate time and efforts and  can still spoil her while making memories. \n IMO you should also look into making a calendar for the entire month of Christmas where you do 1 activity for each day of the month. (you can find ideas on Pinterest) \nTime is a better gift than money. \nYou can also sign up for mother-daughter classes or something of the sort to make memories.", "NTA, but you are spoiling her.", "NAH but like others have said as kids get older they start wanting more pricy things so youre setting the expectation now that holidays will be big-keep this in mind and maybe listen to your husband, if you guys are in a place with snow during Christmas a good idea is giving her memories since she\u2019s getting older not more toys take her sledding or ice skating (in a few years) with your partner get some hot chocolate and come home for a nice dinner together or something.", "NAH.  You both have opinions, nobody's an AH or b**ch here.  You just have to compromise or otherwise work it out.", "This is definitely something you two should decide together.  Right now, YTA for not sitting down and coming to an agreement with him.  He is right, toys only last a few days.  Take the rest of the money and start an investment account or something that they will appreciate when they are older.", "Nobody is the AH here.. but you can definitely find a compromise. Experiences are better than toys and gifts!\nGo to the zoo, amusement parks, the movies, and all sorts of other experiences as gifts that you can do throughout the year.", "YTA, stop, please, it\u2019s a level of consumerism that will lead to crazy entitlement. You think you\u2019re doing the right thing but you\u2019re trying to fill a void from your life not your child\u2019s. Why not give experiences, a trip, a family membership to the zoo or art classes, or a concert. More things does not equal more love, in fact it can lead to dissatisfaction. Your child needs your time and attention, not more stuff. Make Christmas magical with memories, don\u2019t just turn it into an orgy of consumption.", "NAH. Re-read what you wrote. You equate these over-the-top days with a happy mother - a very rare occasion in your childhood it seems. If you hadn't had a zillion gifts, just that your mother was stress-free, not yelling and happy likely would have been enough. Getting all these toys is for YOU to recreate the happy-day feeling, not for your daughter. She'll be happy if her parents are happy.", "NAH, but maybe you can consider experiences as a way to spoil your child than *things.* Focus on ways to build memories, rather than piles of toys under the tree. I have two kiddos and they love heavy toy holidays but so much of their things will never get the attention I think they will.", "Hmm 10 toys is a lot\u2026 I mean nothing wrong with spoiling a kid. But rather than spoil her with lots of materialistic stuff, spoil her with quality time and cool experiences. She\u2019ll remember a day/movie out more than the 11th toy.", "NAH, but you\u2019re setting her and yourself up for a lot of strife in later years.  Do you want her to always expect tons and tons of packages?  Will you be able to afford that when her wants start to include expensive electronics and gadgets?  I get wanting to spoil a kid, but spoiling them makes brats, and this is how you make a brat.  I suggest doing what we do:\n\nSomething she wants.\nSomething she needs.\nSomething she\u2019ll wear.\nSomething she\u2019ll read.\n\nThe \u201cneed\u201d can be anything from new pajamas to a special necklace that shows your love.  That doesn\u2019t mean a pack of socks.  We don\u2019t really set a limit on what we spend, but these four things (plus small stocking things) mean more thought is put into what we give, and that makes those things matter to her.\n\nYour daughter gets gifts throughout the year.  She doesn\u2019t need to have so much on one or two days that the rest is meaningless.  You don\u2019t want her to become very \u201cGIMME!\u201d on those days.  Remember, you\u2019re not wanting to do this for her.  You\u2019re wanting to do it for yourself, but she\u2019ll also pay when she\u2019s unable to be happy later because she didn\u2019t get 63 presents like Dudley Dursley.", "She\u2019s going to create a sense of entitlement in her daughter.", "That is indeed a good thing to keep in mind. Thank you for your thoughts.", "I definitely plan on working this out with him when he\u2019s ready to talk. Thank you for you time and thoughts.", "Right now he is refusing to speak with me on the matter. Once he\u2019s ready to talk I plan sitting down and talking it over with him. Thank you for your time and thoughts.", "I actually really love this idea. We do take a lot of trips to the zoo, science center ect together but I would love to do more of that. Thank you for your time and thoughts", "Yes I advised sledding if they\u2019re in an area with snow I used to love that when I was little", "Some people really do associate the pile under the tree with happy Christmases. My husband grew up in a loving but rather chaotic family, and definitely likes a big pile of presents. They don't need to cost a lot, and he's okay with consumables, but he wants those wrapped things, and not just for himself. Knowing how bonkers things could be at my in-laws, I figure more stuff = stability, happy family, functional holiday. That said, ten toys probably is enough. If you want her to have more, she's probably old enough to enjoy things like books, cute accessories, etc.", "Oh, please. It\u2019s Christmas and the kid is five. Who gives a shit lol", "I was your kid growing up being spoiled on Christmas and birthday\u2019s.. all it got me was an entitled attitude as a middle schooler and it wasn\u2019t cute.\n\nJust an idea. My parents finally started doing stuff like this and it was better then toys and expensive things to clutter the house!", "I didn\u2019t think of that, but that\u2019s a great option! Indoor water parks are a huge hit in my area too! Skiing or snowboarding lessons if you live in an area like that! \n\nWe did a trip to the mountains one year in HS and it was the best Christmas ever!! No gifts at all. Lol", "If OP can\u2019t have a happy holiday without tons of things piled under the tree, then\u2014and I\u2019m not saying this flippantly\u2014she should probably see a therapist to get to the root of why she can\u2019t feel that she can be happy without tons and tons of crap to open.  She could be worried about not having enough, and is responding by risking her daughter being a selfish brat.  She could feel guilty that she\u2019s not spending as much time with her daughter as she should.  There\u2019s nothing normal or healthy about struggling to be happy unless there is an absurd amount of presents to open."]}
