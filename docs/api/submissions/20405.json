Any good parent would have put their kids first over their hearts and/or genitals. Instead of forcing someone to get along with their bully they should have made the bullying stop and try to fix their relationship before they started living together.\n\nBut they didn't.

If you\u2019re no contact then move on and enforce that boundary, not exploit it when convenient for you.", "Yes, he did a sh\\*tty thing but him marrying your bully's mother is completely irrelevant when it comes to his work life. You obviously harbor a lot of resentment toward him so it might be helpful to look into therapy to process it. \n\nIf you meant to keep it to \"we're estranged\" and leave it at that, but then the boss kept pushing you for answers, I don't think you're at fault. Mind you, you could've (and should've) just said, \"I don't really want to talk about it\" before walking away. But in this context I'd say the boss was more of the AH.\n\nPressing an employee's relative for details about their personal life is bad enough, but then to admonish that employee for it later is extremely unprofessional. Frankly, your dad might have good standing to go to HR over this because his boss wildly overstepped.\n\nSo I'll say ESH. You have a right to your feelings but should've been more discreet. Your dad was right to be upset by his boss's behavior but shouldn't have attacked you or your family for it since his boss is the real AH here.", "Apologies, I read that as she was bullying you when you were 8 years old, not that he got married when you were 8. How long had she been bullying you? Do you know how long they had been dating at this stage? I'm just trying to work out the timeline of the dating/marriage compared to the bullying.", "[deleted]", "Funny how that works, isn't it? \n\nWhy are you so invested in taking OP's dad's side?", "Honestly, Boss should have known better than to push *and* should not have spread the information further. It's one thing to have a conversation with OP's Dad about it, but if other people in the office now know it sounds like Boss discussed it publicly - which wouldn't be appropriate.", "The whole family are just ignoring him. That's mostly how it's been the last few years. \n\nThis was not about revenge for me. It was about putting an end to questions I might get asked in the future.", "It's actually pretty unprofessional of the Boss to be spreading the information around. If Boss felt compelled to discuss his employees personal business he should have done so privately. \n\nIf it's spreading around OP's Dad's workplace either Boss told others (unprofessional) or the Dad did (and therefore shouldn't complain).", "They do. In the sense that if I am wrong, I am wrong. It won't make me care about any impact to my father. But overall I will just accept that I should have said I would not be attending anymore and left it there, moving on, saying nothing.", "I've had therapy. But I will always resent him for putting his romantic life before my wellbeing. For thinking I should or could be sisters with that girl.\n\nIn future I will just avoid the question or maybe just avoid chatting to the people who might ask. I don't like questions about why I'm not around him. I'd rather forget he exists.", "It started when I was 5. We were in the same kindy class and it started there with the names and continued on.

I think the time the dating started is when she cut my hair with scissors in class.", "If it's not that big of a deal, then why is it an issue that she told her father's boss? If her father didn't do anything wrong, why does his boss think less of him now?", "I have not seen her since I was 18. But I had to live with my bully and was in the same class as her. So I never got an escape from her. He made me live with someone who had cut my hair, who blasted my period around class to humiliate me, who humiliated me about my appearance.", "But by dating the Bully's mom he ensured that the bully would be part of OPs life outside of school as well. Sometimes you can't date someone, nit because of something that person did, but because of an outside situation which would make dating harmful to yourself or your children.", "[deleted]", "For sure, boss was rude for pressing for details.", "Bullshit. You can't even be honest in your responses, which makes me question the honesty of your posts. This was absolutely a revenge move.", "OR....you could simply say \"I'd rather not discuss it\" instead of just avoiding people and/or the questions they might ask. It sounds like you need more therapy to just simply let go of this resentment instead of letting it continue to infuriate you and blow up in your face eventually at the wrong time.", ">I think the time the dating started is when she cut my hair with scissors in class.\n\nWow. That is awful. I'm so sorry that the result of them being called into the school together was them dating. \n\nI was feeling a little bad for your dad, as it must have been hard to lose his child because he fell in love. And often bullying at 8 isn't all that severe, and it did seem to stop when they got married. So, in some ways, I could see how it may have actually helped the situation. But that doesn't sound like light bullying, and having to live with her must have been trying. That really sucks.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Who told you you are not allowed?", "you're just getting called out for victim blaming. No one said you couldn't express your opinion, you're just getting called out for having a bad opinion", "If it was a revenge move I would have told him everything including the fact I was bullied for five years, he was in and out of the school multiple times with her mother because of it, the fact his whole family told him he was doing wrong.\n\nAll I wanted was to not be asked again. I was not thinking of revenge on him.", "It didn't actually end right when they got married. Was overall about 5ish years (ending when we were about 10). But it meant I was living in hell because I could never get away from her. He expected me to be her sister too. Like I could ever love her.", "You clearly weren't swayed by her take on it though? I doubt she said much different than what she said here.\n\nAnd if it really wasn't a big deal, I don't see how just a \"biased take\" could cause such major consequences. Seems like the boss should've just brushed it off like you are (if her father is innocent as you say he is).\n\nEdit: and he even confronted her father and gave him a chance to give his take and yet he's still experiencing negative consequences?", "He told me I needed to be sisters with the girl. He told me I needed to be family with her. That the bullying would get better eventually. But that we were going to be a family. It was hell for me. He was not supportive enough. He lost his extended family over it because they all thought he was horrifically shitty as a dad to me for that.", "My point was that the father *did* treat OP poorly.

Your father sounds a lot like mine.\n\nMine often tells people his children won\u2019t speak to him and he doesn\u2019t know why. Woe is him, he can\u2019t figure out why we hate him so much \n\nThe truth is he left one night right before Christmas, emptied the family bank account and moved to somewhere in Florida and never called or texted or emailed any of us again. I couldn\u2019t speak to him even if I wanted to\n\nHe tells his little tales to people who think he\u2019s a great guy, and sometimes someone meets one of us and confronts us on it, so we just tell them the truth. I even offer up my phone number so daddy can call me if he wants to\u2026. Guess what\u2019s never happened\u2026\n\nYou spoke the truth to someone when they asked you about your absence at a family event. It\u2019s your fathers fault that the truth doesn\u2019t paint him in a good light. Now he\u2019s struggling to control the narrative again.", "I always wonder why everybody wants the victimized person to be the better person and not bring up stuff with people outside the family. The fact of the matter is this boss already knew who she was already knew about the family dynamics and was fishing for info. Why should she have to lie to protect someone she has no contact with who is probably already making \nstuff up about her and why they\u2019re not talking. \n\nNta", "Lol. Nope. NTA. \"You're the real monster for describing the awful shit that I willingly did!\"", "NTA.\n\nIf the truth gets HIM in trouble, he should just be thankful it wasn't as immediate as justice SHOULD have been.", "NTA.  He asked why you were no contact.  Sounds like your father needed that wake-up call when you were 8.  Sorry your adopted family members got reamed out by him, but I think it also showed you that you were right about going no contact with him.", "NTA. Like others have said, if telling the truth made him look bad, that's because what he did was bad. \n\nAs for the comments saying it was wrong to tell this to your dad's boss - you said they were close. In my workplace there are lots of people who are friends outside of work, even with our direct supervisors. We are all very self directed so there isn't really a strict hierarchy. So to me it isn't necessarily taboo, if that makes sense.", "NTA.  Truth hurts.", "The truth hurts it seems.\n\nNTA", "This. I can't believe how many people are saying OP is NTA.", "Totally! OP is a major YTA!", "Yea\u2026boss made a polite comment and OP went way TMI. Spilling personal info like that to a stranger is tacky. I would say it was an AH move to the boss more than the dad, that would be such an awkward conversation to be in lmao.", ">He asked what happened and mentioned \"my sister\" and I told him she was not my sister and that she was actually my bully before dad married her mom and that he married this woman knowing her child was bullying me. \n\nDo tell, what do you think OP should have said? Claimed the bully as her sister and just said I decided I wanted a different family? Or just walked away and ignored him when he started asking? /s", "Clearly OP is still harboring resentment for what happened when she was a child. OP needs therapy. This decades old issue is too much at the forefront of her mind.", "Let's see how you respond when someone call your bully your sibling", "Why should she hide what happened to her? That is how abusers hide they put the shame on them. Her father should have protected her.

Could you explain that a bit?", "Well, considering that OP stated in their post that they cut all contact with her father when she turned 18, I\u2019m pretty sure she already figured that out.", "The fact that the boss said he hoped she could make it to the next family day, implies that the dad acts like they\u2019re still on speaking terms and just haven\u2019t had the chance to.

I suppose if I\u2019d done something like that then no.", "Those details weren\u2019t just her fathers it was lies he had told about her and her life.

I understand how honesty is a good policy, but outing 1). some of your dad's personal info and 2). your baggage *to his boss*?\n\nThat's kinda messy. I don't know if I can fully endorse that.

Weird take, but okay.", "Not making the situation inappropriately personal and awkward isn't \"covering for him\". \n\nThere are many things she could have said to get her point across without trauma-dumping on her dad's boss. \n\nThe boss asked an innocent follow up question- I sincerely doubt he was interested in this amount of detail on any level above the same instinct that urges us to look at accidents as we drive by.", "That\u2019s not even legally her father even more, though it definitely sounds like that\u2019s not what he\u2019s letting people think", "You did nothing wrong!
