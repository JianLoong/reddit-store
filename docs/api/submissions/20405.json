You obviously harbor a lot of resentment toward him so it might be helpful to look into therapy to process it. \n\nIf you meant to keep it to \"we're estranged\" and leave it at that, but then the boss kept pushing you for answers, I don't think you're at fault. Mind you, you could've (and should've) just said, \"I don't really want to talk about it\" before walking away. But in this context I'd say the boss was more of the AH.\n\nPressing an employee's relative for details about their personal life is bad enough, but then to admonish that employee for it later is extremely unprofessional. Frankly, your dad might have good standing to go to HR over this because his boss wildly overstepped.\n\nSo I'll say ESH. You have a right to your feelings but should've been more discreet. Your dad was right to be upset by his boss's behavior but shouldn't have attacked you or your family for it since his boss is the real AH here.", "Apologies, I read that as she was bullying you when you were 8 years old, not that he got married when you were 8. How long had she been bullying you? Do you know how long they had been dating at this stage?

That's mostly how it's been the last few years. \n\nThis was not about revenge for me. It was about putting an end to questions I might get asked in the future.", "It's actually pretty unprofessional of the Boss to be spreading the information around. If Boss felt compelled to discuss his employees personal business he should have done so privately. \n\nIf it's spreading around OP's Dad's workplace either Boss told others (unprofessional) or the Dad did (and therefore shouldn't complain).", "They do. In the sense that if I am wrong, I am wrong. It won't make me care about any impact to my father.

But I will always resent him for putting his romantic life before my wellbeing. For thinking I should or could be sisters with that girl.\n\nIn future I will just avoid the question or maybe just avoid chatting to the people who might ask.

If her father didn't do anything wrong, why does his boss think less of him now?", "I have not seen her since I was 18. But I had to live with my bully and was in the same class as her. So I never got an escape from her. He made me live with someone who had cut my hair, who blasted my period around class to humiliate me, who humiliated me about my appearance.", "But by dating the Bully's mom he ensured that the bully would be part of OPs life outside of school as well.

You can't even be honest in your responses, which makes me question the honesty of your posts. This was absolutely a revenge move.", "OR....you could simply say \"I'd rather not discuss it\" instead of just avoiding people and/or the questions they might ask. It sounds like you need more therapy to just simply let go of this resentment instead of letting it continue to infuriate you and blow up in your face eventually at the wrong time.", ">I think the time the dating started is when she cut my hair with scissors in class.\n\nWow. That is awful. I'm so sorry that the result of them being called into the school together was them dating. \n\nI was feeling a little bad for your dad, as it must have been hard to lose his child because he fell in love. And often bullying at 8 isn't all that severe, and it did seem to stop when they got married. So, in some ways, I could see how it may have actually helped the situation. But that doesn't sound like light bullying, and having to live with her must have been trying. That really sucks.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Who told you you are not allowed?", "you're just getting called out for victim blaming. No one said you couldn't express your opinion, you're just getting called out for having a bad opinion", "If it was a revenge move I would have told him everything including the fact I was bullied for five years, he was in and out of the school multiple times with her mother because of it, the fact his whole family told him he was doing wrong.\n\nAll I wanted was to not be asked again. I was not thinking of revenge on him.", "It didn't actually end right when they got married. Was overall about 5ish years (ending when we were about 10). But it meant I was living in hell because I could never get away from her. He expected me to be her sister too. Like I could ever love her.", "You clearly weren't swayed by her take on it though? I doubt she said much different than what she said here.\n\nAnd if it really wasn't a big deal, I don't see how just a \"biased take\" could cause such major consequences. Seems like the boss should've just brushed it off like you are (if her father is innocent as you say he is).\n\nEdit: and he even confronted her father and gave him a chance to give his take and yet he's still experiencing negative consequences?", "He told me I needed to be sisters with the girl. He told me I needed to be family with her. That the bullying would get better eventually. But that we were going to be a family. It was hell for me. He was not supportive enough. He lost his extended family over it because they all thought he was horrifically shitty as a dad to me for that.", "My point was that the father *did* treat OP poorly.

I always feel like someone is talking shit about me or I can't trust no one. I feel like I'm over weight when I know I'm not, I just had my 3 kid and I still feel like crap. My husband gets mad at me for never believing him when he tells me I'm beautiful. I always tell my daughter she is beautiful and everything opposite I was told!", "NTA it\u2019s your story to tell because it happened to you!

Where there other issues (this is where we need INFO, I can only assume there *must have been* other issues, but it would be just that: baseless assumptions)\n\n8 year kids olds are stupid and immature. I was bullied extensively all throughout school by people that I\u2019m pretty sure are probably fine adults nowadays. Some of them not. People are imperfect and if I honestly held lifelong grudges like that, then pity be on me. Especially in light that \u201cit got better.\u201d How long did the bullying continue? Did step sister always remain a bad person, or did she mature and become a better person.

Is that a good relationship? Is she a good person? Does his father now have someone who loves him and vice versa?

There\u2019s gotta be more info there.\n\nRegardless of all that, OP giving unnecessary detail to the boss makes him an asshole anyways.

Just because her bully grew up doesn't mean that the damage is now undone.

But he would surely have asked the father for more info and who knows what he would have said about her behind her back. NTA", "I do think that's OP's perspective. The thing is, we don't know details, and a lot of the things you've said here, while possibly being true, are assumptions. We cant quantify how bad it was. We don't know if the parents did try, to no avail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething I feel many people fail to do with this SR is remember that it's a picture painted by one narrator, with a vested interest in protecting their own image, and thus to always give the benefit of the doubt, or even concede to ignorance, details that one can only assume about. Holding a grudge since 8 is a very exceptional circumstance. It can speak to different possibilities. Taken at face value, what OP has said shows this: Father put his own needs above his child at the time. That's bad. *Maybe* it is unforgivable, more details would need to be present.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut fast forwarding to modern day, what OP did is still AH behavior. Justified, maybe and likely, but still AH behavior. ESH because the way OP answered was bad, the boss spreading it is bad and the dads actions in the past were bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP chose to divulge information in an unbecoming way, their words have reflected badly on their character, and they clearly need help to get over this to become a better self that wouldn't feel the need to do something that's just bad, for others and themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(an aside, boiling down a cleary lasting and potentially good relationship as a guy just getting \"his dick wet\" is quite crass and shortsighted of you. Much like OP's behavior, words can say a lot about who we are as people and where our biases lie. I think this SR deserves more people who don't let those biases influence what they think in an absolute way.)", "\u201cNot getting along\u201d and bullying are two different things.

Even to bosses, friends, significant others, distant family of those we\u2019ve cut out. It\u2019s not our job to protect them. But it was their job to love us and not hurt us.

Thinks everything he ever did is perfect and only ever wants to discuss the past to emphasize he's done nothing wrong ever and everyone else in the family is crazy and he's perfect.\n\nI bet the Dad in this post thinks he's the victim and has never put a foot wrong.\n\nNTA", "ESH, although OP least of all.  Dad for creating such a strained situation and assuming that everything would just work out.  I wonder if he's one of those who thinks that being bullied is a valuable life lesson (as long as it's not happening to him.)\n\nI think that OP went into a bit more detail than he should have.  Maybe just say we're estranged and I wasn't happy with my step family.\n\nThe boss may be friends with the father, but they also have a professional relationship, and it really wasn't his place to confront the father, and certainly not to spread the story to other people.", "I hate these reruns. Reminds me of watching TV over the summer when I was a kid.", "Pretty much this", "Legit. It\u2019s not like he married the girl. He married her mom. I\u2019d love to know how the mom is and how the mom treats her. I think more background is needed.", "But there\u2019s also no reason not to tell his boss. She was asked a question and she answered. While yes, she could\u2019ve refrained from sharing, she doesn\u2019t owe her dad anything", "No, this was way over sharing with people that aren't involved. Boss made a polite \"hope to see you\" comment and OP  unloaded the family drama - this was not the bosses circus or monkeys.  OP needs therapy.", "It\u2019s answering a question. Vindictive is going out of her way to expose her father, not what happened. This is her story too and she can tell whomever she wants, and she certainly doesn\u2019t owe her dad anything", "She never made it about her, she answered a direct question. Making it about her would\u2019ve been going out of her way to expose him, not what happened. She doesn\u2019t owe her father anything, certainly not lying to cover for him and if she wants to share her story that\u2019s her prerogative.", "If OP had disclosed the information without any context then no I wouldn't.\n\nBut OP was asked a direct question i.e. Why aren't you going to the company family day.  OP answered truthfully.\n\nOP was then asked another direct question, why was OP NC with their father. Again OP answered truthfully.\n\nWas OP supposed to lie for her father?", "personally i would not give a shit. i have absolutely made mistakes in my day- don\u2019t get me wrong. the difference is that i will own up to it and not blame others for being honest about *my actions*\n\nalso if my boss can\u2019t understand that i am not a perfect person despite trying my best, i don\u2019t wanna work for them.", "But how could the Dad have \"no idea\" about the bully when he literally met the bully's mom from being called to the school about bullying incidents like the bully *cutting off his daughter's hair*? It's obvious the dad is lying \ud83e\udd25", "You're really going hard for the dad here for some reason.", "Who are up to question and downplay OP\u2019s trauma?\n\nI want to add perspective that bad stuff happening to an 8 yo can be traumatizing for life with a family story.\n\nWhen my brother was 6-8yo, he went to live with my uncle when our dad became a POW in the 70s. My uncle loves his little brother and showed extra affection to his nephew, that he never showed to his own kids. \n\nMy cousins (8-16 yo at the time) relentlessly bullied, tormented and tortured my brother. They always made sure that the cuts, scars and bruises were areas that would be covered up by clothes and my uncle wouldn\u2019t see. My brother has severe PTSD, refused to talk to any of his cousins and promised to never return to his home country. \n\nI spoke with my cousins years later when I went back home to visit my relatives and they all regretted what they did. They are all nice and outstanding people (doctors/professor, lawyers, architects). I told my brother how much regrets they had and want to apologize to him in person. He said that he knows they are better people but what they did to him as a child, he can never forget even if he tries and thus, he cannot forgive them.\n\nEdit: spelling", "I\u2019m pretty sure the dad posted about his daughter on here or maybe OP made a different one explaining what happened, but I vaguely remember a different story about this same thing of a dad marrying the mother of his daughters bully and then trying to force his daughter into treating the bully like family.", "It\u2019s not based on 8 yr old bullying it\u2019s based on her dad caring more bout getting his dick wet than than his daughters well being. And she didn\u2019t try to dictate anything, she answered questions she was asked. Yes, she could\u2019ve refrained from sharing but she doesn\u2019t owe her dad anything and he made his bed", "You've 100% editorialized for OP. You're as full of it as she is", "She's made a story up about how she's the main character forgetting her father's happiness and only thinking about herself. Her entire life she's angry at him for falling in love when she was 8. Big picture story, not the short version where she shit talked her dad because she still holds a grudge she needs to get over", "I agree so much. Just because you share DNA with someone does not mean you have to paint them a saint.", "Was she actually being bullied, or is she just dramatic? My niece thinks it\u2019s bullying if you tell her she has to bathe, eat, clean her room, or literally anything else she doesn\u2019t want to do.", "Not a bit of what you said is relevant to OP needing therapy. \n\nAnd if you did this you would absolutely be in need of therapy too. \n\nI don\u2019t think twice to what my bully from 20 years ago did. Because it is wholly irrelevant and I have moved on. As you and OP should have about 20 years ago.", "Umm she was 8 and being forced to live with her bully for yrs and parents allowed the bullying to continue while living together, she clearly had no safe space and that kinda shit can fuck you up for a real long time. Dad cared more bout getting his dick wet than the safety and well-being of his child. And she is the main character of HER life, why should she be prioritizing her estranged father\u2019s relationship with his boss when he\u2019s clearly never given a shit about her. Your implying that she owes it to her dad to protect his reputation when she does not. She did not go out of her way trying to expose him she answered a question she was asked as opposed to lying and covering his ass", "Is that boarding school comment based on the post from a week or so back where the OP was supposedly bullied and got her step sis shipped off? And then came back in her life to talk shit\n\nCause these stories share similarities and it's disappointing how many people justify being vindictive. Like I get why someone may feel that way, but it's immature and they're in the wrong so why come here to get validation.", "And the thing I\u2019m stuck on- Op hasn\u2019t forgiven him after years. Even though \u201cthings got better \u201c. What happened in the interim ??", "Family means nothing when they allow abuse to happen. Get off your high horse. Estrangements are so common, and strangers questioning the reasons are unnecessary.", "No one is forcing OP to not be an asshole.  You can be an asshole all day, but that doesn't make you any less of an asshole.", "Yep. There\u2019s a reason the truth hurts is a saying", "Then again, the boss talked to the father about it privately, then the information somehow got out to the point that OP is hearing about the fall out. Either the boss then gossiped, or the farther complained and didn't get the response he was hoping for.\n\nIf the boss really didn't want in on the drama, he could have just not mentioned what OP said.\n\nAll in all, OP did overshare, but I do understand their bitterness towards their father and the distaste at being referred to as his child (they aren't just no contact, they straight up legally severed ties) or the former bully's sibling.\n\nI get that it's not the exact same thing, but if an abusive ex still claimed you as their partner, would you not correct that lie with little care as to their fallout in their life?", "Lmao yea, close in a work relationship. That still doesn\u2019t mean spill all your personal drama\u2026", "Well that's what she said except by adding she bullied her.", "How was she seeking revenge? This is the stupidest take I\u2019ve ever seen. She should protect his image all of a sudden when he couldn\u2019t even protect his own daughter. She answered a question honestly about her own life.", "You don\u2019t know why she said it tho ur speculating and reaching conclusions based on that. She could\u2019ve lied for him yes, but she certainly doesn\u2019t owe him her protection. She could\u2019ve even shared nothing at all, but it\u2019s her story too and if she wants to tell it that\u2019s her prerogative. The actions of daughter and father r in no way balanced or \u201cequally cruel\u201d.  Dad made his bed, these r just the consequences of his actions", "So **yes** OP was supposed to lie.  To **lie** to protect her father that emotionally abused her and let her down horribly.\n\nYou're just as horrible as the father.", "I don't suppose your dad and her mum met for the first time at a parent teacher meeting about the bullying, did they?", "They didn\u2019t say the dad had narcissistic personality disorder or diagnose in any way they said he\u2019s a narcissist, which anyone can be and which is true here. The dad cared more bout getting his dick wet than the safety and well-being of his child, I don\u2019t think calling him a narcissistic is a reach"]}
