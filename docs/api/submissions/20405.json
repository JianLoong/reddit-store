It's not your job to protect your estranged father, nor should you be forced into a position of dishonesty to do so.\n\nSounds like your dad is (finally) facing the consequences of his own choices.

He never cared about mine when he married the mother of my bully.", ">First off, your dad is supposed to not marry someone they love because you got bullied by their daughter?\n\nYeah, absolutely. Any good parent would have put their kids first over their hearts and/or genitals. Instead of forcing someone to get along with their bully they should have made the bullying stop and try to fix their relationship before they started living together.\n\nBut they didn't. Instead they kept dating while the bullying continued and later got married forcing OP to live with her bully while the bullying continued for years (said by OP in comments) and forced them to try to be sisters.\n\nYou are really surprised OP has a grudge against him? The father fucked up and now he has to live with the consequences of his actions.", "That's a shitty thing to do to your kid though? Marrying into their bullies family and dragging them into that.", "I was 8 (as mentioned in the post) and it was a lot of name calling, trying to have me excluded, humiliating me (mostly around my appearance but while they were married I started my period young and she used that to do it too for a while).", "It was more than teasing.

Let me tell you my whole damn life story to make sure you start to dislike a man you were previously close to.\" \n\nWhat is wrong with you?", "I wasn't talking about your father's happiness. I was talking about how the whole family and his workplace now sounds embroiled in unnecessary drama so that you could have som satisfaction at trying to make your dad as miserable as you had been. Revenge is poison, mostly for the person trying to enact it. Have fun!", "Re: your first sentence. Do our opinions matter then?", "Life\u2019s too short to hold a grudge.  OP even said it got better.", "Shitty yes, but has exactly no bearing on his job. Some would say spilling personal details that are irrelevant to a job is also shitty. If you\u2019re no contact then move on and enforce that boundary, not exploit it when convenient for you.", "Yes, he did a sh\\*tty thing but him marrying your bully's mother is completely irrelevant when it comes to his work life. You obviously harbor a lot of resentment toward him so it might be helpful to look into therapy to process it. \n\nIf you meant to keep it to \"we're estranged\" and leave it at that, but then the boss kept pushing you for answers, I don't think you're at fault. Mind you, you could've (and should've) just said, \"I don't really want to talk about it\" before walking away. But in this context I'd say the boss was more of the AH.\n\nPressing an employee's relative for details about their personal life is bad enough, but then to admonish that employee for it later is extremely unprofessional. Frankly, your dad might have good standing to go to HR over this because his boss wildly overstepped.\n\nSo I'll say ESH. You have a right to your feelings but should've been more discreet. Your dad was right to be upset by his boss's behavior but shouldn't have attacked you or your family for it since his boss is the real AH here.", "Apologies, I read that as she was bullying you when you were 8 years old, not that he got married when you were 8. How long had she been bullying you? Do you know how long they had been dating at this stage? I'm just trying to work out the timeline of the dating/marriage compared to the bullying.", "[deleted]", "Funny how that works, isn't it? \n\nWhy are you so invested in taking OP's dad's side?", "Honestly, Boss should have known better than to push *and* should not have spread the information further. It's one thing to have a conversation with OP's Dad about it, but if other people in the office now know it sounds like Boss discussed it publicly - which wouldn't be appropriate.", "The whole family are just ignoring him. That's mostly how it's been the last few years. \n\nThis was not about revenge for me. It was about putting an end to questions I might get asked in the future.", "It's actually pretty unprofessional of the Boss to be spreading the information around. If Boss felt compelled to discuss his employees personal business he should have done so privately. \n\nIf it's spreading around OP's Dad's workplace either Boss told others (unprofessional) or the Dad did (and therefore shouldn't complain).", "They do. In the sense that if I am wrong, I am wrong. It won't make me care about any impact to my father. But overall I will just accept that I should have said I would not be attending anymore and left it there, moving on, saying nothing.", "I've had therapy. But I will always resent him for putting his romantic life before my wellbeing. For thinking I should or could be sisters with that girl.\n\nIn future I will just avoid the question or maybe just avoid chatting to the people who might ask. I don't like questions about why I'm not around him. I'd rather forget he exists.", "It started when I was 5. We were in the same kindy class and it started there with the names and continued on. My dad started dating her when I was 7. Married when I was 8. They met after they had been called to the school a few times. I think the time the dating started is when she cut my hair with scissors in class.", "If it's not that big of a deal, then why is it an issue that she told her father's boss? If her father didn't do anything wrong, why does his boss think less of him now?", "I have not seen her since I was 18. But I had to live with my bully and was in the same class as her. So I never got an escape from her. He made me live with someone who had cut my hair, who blasted my period around class to humiliate me, who humiliated me about my appearance.", "But by dating the Bully's mom he ensured that the bully would be part of OPs life outside of school as well. Sometimes you can't date someone, nit because of something that person did, but because of an outside situation which would make dating harmful to yourself or your children.", "[deleted]", "For sure, boss was rude for pressing for details.", "Bullshit. You can't even be honest in your responses, which makes me question the honesty of your posts. This was absolutely a revenge move.", "OR....you could simply say \"I'd rather not discuss it\" instead of just avoiding people and/or the questions they might ask. It sounds like you need more therapy to just simply let go of this resentment instead of letting it continue to infuriate you and blow up in your face eventually at the wrong time.", ">I think the time the dating started is when she cut my hair with scissors in class.\n\nWow. That is awful. I'm so sorry that the result of them being called into the school together was them dating. \n\nI was feeling a little bad for your dad, as it must have been hard to lose his child because he fell in love. And often bullying at 8 isn't all that severe, and it did seem to stop when they got married. So, in some ways, I could see how it may have actually helped the situation. But that doesn't sound like light bullying, and having to live with her must have been trying. That really sucks.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Who told you you are not allowed?", "you're just getting called out for victim blaming. No one said you couldn't express your opinion, you're just getting called out for having a bad opinion", "If it was a revenge move I would have told him everything including the fact I was bullied for five years, he was in and out of the school multiple times with her mother because of it, the fact his whole family told him he was doing wrong.\n\nAll I wanted was to not be asked again. I was not thinking of revenge on him.", "It didn't actually end right when they got married. Was overall about 5ish years (ending when we were about 10). But it meant I was living in hell because I could never get away from her. He expected me to be her sister too. Like I could ever love her.", "You clearly weren't swayed by her take on it though? I doubt she said much different than what she said here.\n\nAnd if it really wasn't a big deal, I don't see how just a \"biased take\" could cause such major consequences. Seems like the boss should've just brushed it off like you are (if her father is innocent as you say he is).\n\nEdit: and he even confronted her father and gave him a chance to give his take and yet he's still experiencing negative consequences?", "He told me I needed to be sisters with the girl. He told me I needed to be family with her. That the bullying would get better eventually. But that we were going to be a family. It was hell for me. He was not supportive enough. He lost his extended family over it because they all thought he was horrifically shitty as a dad to me for that.", "My point was that the father *did* treat OP poorly. Your comment was incredibly dismissive of that. \n\nOPs dad obviously wasn't currently mistreating OP because they don't have contact, but that doesn't mean that the Dads behaviour wasn't harmful in the past.", "[deleted]", "He deserved to lose everything and everyone he did. If he loses everything I won't feel bad for him. He has choices. I didn't as a kid.", "It's obvious that you've never experienced this kind of thing.  It does ruin lives.\n\nYou're being a bully just like her stepsister.  Stop it.  OP is NTA.", "You're being ridiculous. I didn't sneak attack and cut OP's hair. I don't even know her."]}
