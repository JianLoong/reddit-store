Really???\n\nIf that's truly truly the truth- he needs help. He likely has massive depression. I'd google depression and see if he exhibits any other symptoms.\n\nIf not- he's not being supportive. How could he do that to you??? That's awful and I am so sorry. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you can get your things back!", "NTA\nSo he encouraged you to stay at home,  leaving you with no independent income. Refused to help you empty your storage unit.  Didn't pay for it and then cried about how he couldn't deal with it?  This is moving dangerously close to financial and emotional abuse. You have lost items because he neglected the duties he insisted on taking on and instead of taking responsibility for his actions,  he used emotionally manipulative tatics to avoid taking the blame.  You need to go back to work for your own independence and finances, and you need to be very wary if a person who says they want to take care of you but allow your items to be lost in such a way.", "mabey only to yourself for him not being an ex fiance  if he did not want to deal with it that is a HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE red flag", "What sort of things were in storage? What exactly have you lost? This sounds really bad. He's basically thrown your belongings away. This shows a massive lack of respect and care and love basically. I would be very mad. As for not wanting you to work, how financially secure are you? Are you on the mortgage/tenancy? Does everything go into a joint account that you can see? I fear not if you didn't know storage payments weren't being made. Does he just give you money each month? You might need to look into what constitutes financial abuse as you may be in a vulnerable position.", "He pissed on you and your stuff.\n\nYour wants, needs and the stuff you value are worthless to him.\n\nThat's what he proved.\n\nThe only way you could consider being a stay at home mom for this guy is if his pay check went to your bank account and you made all the financial decisions.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s in the unit (I\u2019m assuming a lot of your things), but he basically threw away your stuff because he\u2019s \u201ctired\u201d?! I\u2019d be angry too.\n\nAlso, if the money is there, it seems really suspicious that he just unilaterally decided to stop paying for it. Those are YOUR things. So now you have no job, no things, and no money of your own. I\u2019d be very weary of being dependent on someone who has so little regard for me and my belongings. If I were you, I\u2019d be going back to work ASAP even if it\u2019s part time to have my own funds.", "NTA. This guy is a walking red flag. Do you have family who can help you out until you can get a job and get your ducks in a row to get support? \n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT MARRY THIS MAN.", "I'm sorry but how is he not an ex? He willing and maliciously let all your stuff be sold off. You do realize he could've told you at literally any point leading up to this, and you could've figured something out to stop it. They usually warn a good bit before having to hit the we're selling it point. I would be pissed and would not be able to come back from that. \n\n NTA But you need to think hard about this.", "NTA my gut feeling is he let all your possessions go so it will be harder for you to ever leave.", "INFO. Why was he responsible for paying the storage and did you respond to the default letter?", "i\u2019m not gonna pass any judgment because y\u2019all both are going through a hard time. he\u2019s adjusting to being a parent, to not one but two children, being a husband, and now being the main provider. it\u2019s a lot, but your also going through a lot. i don\u2019t feel like this needed to be brought to reddit but to each their own. i think y\u2019all need to sit down and talk, maybe it\u2019s time you go back to work", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know it's tempting to enjoy being at home with your child but start looking at work, even part-time to start with.  You'll both be paying for childcare after all so it won't be all coming out of only your income or does he think differently?

I used to buy some of these \"abandoned units\" and you may be able to have a friend bid on it.  You won't be able to, but someone else can.  If they haven't completed the auction sale yet, you can still pay the past due bills, even if you have a final notice of auction.  These places will work with you because they make more from you paying the past amounts than they would at auction.  I've actually won a few units only to have the sale canceled before I could go to the unit and sign the paperwork, it was always because someone made a payment on the unit.
