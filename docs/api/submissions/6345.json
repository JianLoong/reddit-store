It's his driveway and she cause him discomfort. The reason to not let her use it is that he doesn't want her using.", "Its not just OP's property though, it's also his wife's, and she says yes. Spouses should discuss things like this, and for that reasons are helpful.", "Look, I agree with you, A simple 'no' could suffice for this situation.  \n\nBut someone somewhere has a discussion with their wife about it, and decided to post here.  They already knew the legalities of the situation, but they wanted to  know what the public thinks.\n\nIn this forum, we provide opinions, often based on small paragraphs of text, never with the complete picture. That's OK, because commenters add reasoning and explainations why they answer X or Y. \n\nWould OP be the AH if he blocked in an ambulance parked on his driveway because his neighbour needed medical assistance? Yes. \n\nWould OP be the AH if there was a dual driveway, with room for 2 cars (one on his property, one on his neighbours) and the neighbour always parks in the middle taking both spaces simply because it's convenient for her? No. \n\n  \nSomewhere between those 2 extremes is OPs situation, and we are here because we voluntarily want to debate this moral conundrum. And there's more at play than legal ownership here. ALL of those things matter to the discussion of this forum. Be glad we disagree on some of the things here, because that's what this place is for.", "Health factors that lead to weight gain are not rare. I suffer from ME, which stops me from doing exercise, and it's not at all an uncommon disability. Arthritis stops my mother from exercising as much as she needs. My wife is held back by asthma. My MIL has joint issues from hypermobility *and* asthma.  Depression can cause weight gain. So can anxiety. So can an alarming amount of medications. So can simply being poor, as cheaper foods tend to contain more fat. Yes, poor diet and lack of exercise are the biggest factor, but there are often other issues underlying those factors. \n\nNone of these are unusual, all of them have one thing in common: They're invisible. When people look at an overweight person, often all they can see is the weight. They don't see the cause because it doesn't show on the outside. I guarantee you that a good number of the overweight people you will see in your life need a lot more than a diet and some exercise. No one should be making assumptions on anyone's health based purely on what they can see.", "I don't think the point was \"knee troubles made her overweight\" in a literal way, but especially if you used to be an active person it's easy to gain weight when you can't be that active anymore. \nI struggle with the opposite issue - being more active makes me struggle not to be underweight- and of course you can't keep up the same diet in that case but a diet takes work to change.", "the overweight and health issues were mentioned in the post because its apparently why the wife thinks OP is an AH for asking the neighbor to stop parking there. Im not saying they arent relevant to mention, since its literally been the excuse given by OPs wife that he shouldve said nothing and let her keep doing it. you are basically saying exactly what i did : her health and weight doesnt entitle her to use someone elses property.", "Your neighbor could solve her own problems by getting some sort of wheeled cary and not inconvenience/irritate you at all. Stick to your guns. She doesn't need to use your driveway whether you are using it or not.", "Yea, that's why i said he's technically in the right, but 1h/week? He said his driveway is big enough to fit 6 cars, someone being parked there for 1h/w isn't gonna do much harm.", "And the fact that she blocks his car is also a factor imagine if he has an emergency?", "> she says yes\n\nNo, she didn't. She said\n\n> \"oh we have 2 kids and need to use all of the space in the driveway for parking and playing\"\n\nwhich sure sounds like \"no\" to me. Not a very firm \"no\", sounds like a negotiable \"no\", but it's still \"no\".", "I wish I could upvote this once for each of the boxes I tick!  \nMy depression is worsened by my ME, and vice versa; those plus the you-know-what years brought back agoraphobia, and my knees are arthritic but I'm still on a wait list to see a specialist about it because while Australia has public healthcare it isn't exactly speedy. My medication affects weight, as does the PCOS.  \nIf it were as simple as *just exercise more* don't you (not you specifically, the general 'you') think I'd maybe do that?!", "I am indeed, but you went straight to 'she needs to walk', which is unnecessary. You then indicated that losing weight would help her knee problems, and while less weight would probably mean less pain, you're perpetuating the stereotype that overweight people's medical issues can largely be solved by weight loss. It may seem like a small thing but comments like that are what keeps these misconceptions alive. No offence was intended, just a request to frame your words differently. \n\n\nIf she does have a medical condition then the neighbour needs to talk to OP and try to work out a compromise.", "It's always only a small time when it's inconvenient, until the yime stretches and/or it becomes inconvenient. And then it's a nightmare to get a person out of a bad habit after years, instead of say, weeks.\n\nI'm a great fan of nipping problems in the bud.", "You're right, she didn't say yes to the neighbor. She implied \"no\" to her husband when she got mad at him for telling the neighbor no. Either way, OP needs to figure out how to handle this issue WITH his wife, which is way having reasons to back up his side is much, much more helpful than just a blanket no to his wife", "That's a lot of ticks! My friends and I call this 'disability bingo' because so many of these go hand in hand all the time!\n\nMy ME came from having a certain virus, (it got into our household just after our government forced all the kids back to school, what a coincidence), so I've only been dealing with it for two years. I *just* managed to get a therapist who specialises in ME, the NHS isn't as broken as everyone thinks... It's worse!\n\nDo you have as much trouble working out where symptoms are coming from as I do? It took a while to even spot the ME, it hid among the depression symptoms!", "i think i missexpressed me or you are mistaking me with the person you first answered to.\n\nWhat i was saying is that maybe a weight loss wouldnt help her knee problems (because we cant know if hers is due to weight, age, or anything unrelated. weight is most definitely *not* the only reason of knee problems), but it would help not make it worst. its like putting weight on a broken stick, it isnt the cause it was already broken, but it might break it more.\n\nI also mentioned that i understand we arent all equal against weight loss attempts, some people simply have a sh#t metabolism, other struggles from underlying health issues, etc etc. its never that simple. she might be trying hard to lose weight, she might not. but in either case it does simply not entitle her to use someone elses property, even if her weight is caused by a disease or if she has health problems that are and/or arent related to her weight.\n\nIm really sorry if i offended anyone, i just jumped on the argument that was already in place about the knees.\n\nOf course she couldve tried to negociate a compromise, but she basically didnt even ask first, she just said \"your predecessor let me use this place for years\" \"ok thats nice but we need the place so you cant anymore\" \"ok cool ill do it anyway\". hard to work on a compromise on that.", "YTA because it is also your wife's driveway and it needed to be a collaborative decision. If you both agreed not to let her use it then you wouldn't be the asshole.", "NTA\n\nShe was rude for using it, you told her not to (hopefully calmly) and she stopped.", "In my unpopular opinion YTA, there are so many bigger problems and she was hurting no one. Why you have the time and energy to create a problem out of this is beyond me. The neighbour has been presumptuous and should have asked your permission in order to avoid this issue but why not let her be unless it does become an issue which it very well might not?", "Technically NTA \n\nBut if I was your neighbor and heard about this I wouldn't be doing the friendly neighbor thing I do with my friendly neighbors.\n\nI'd be one of those \"I didn't see who messed with your car\" neighbors knowing you weren't the type to help a neighbor with physical health problems.", "NTA \n\nYou asked nicely once. Next time tell her you\u2019re going to call a tow truck. Your driveway is not communal property. Maybe plant some bushes between the driveway and the stairs?", "NTA. No means no.

The car sits there for roughly 20-30 minutes each time it's in the driveway for loading/unloading and she is behind my car in the driveway. \n\nIt bothers me because it blocks my car even if it's for that somewhat short period of time each time but if there was any kind of emergency with my kids I'd have to take an extra step of asking her to move and waiting for her to move. Small chances but in an emergency situation I want to get out as fast as possible to where I need to go. \n\nI'm always wary of things out of my control on our property where we would be liable and could be sued as well just by someone being on our property when an accident occurred or something out of the blue as well.\n\nLast bother is our dog howling and barking because someone is in our driveway and it happens to be her loading/unloading when we didn't give her permission to use the driveway as it makes us uncomfortable.\n\nAll in all mostly anxiety causing frustration of all the What Ifs that could occur as we tend to have some crazy bad luck sometimes where a lot of What Ifs come to fruition.", "Is it easy or possible to lose weight based on your personal health profile? Maybe not. Would losing weight and strengthening your leg muscles help knee issues? Absolutely. \n\nI can sympathize with the difficulty of losing weight when you\u2019re obese even if that\u2019s your only health problem and recognize many issues complicate at minimum being able to exercise.
